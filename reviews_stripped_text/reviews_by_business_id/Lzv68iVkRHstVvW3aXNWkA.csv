18718,2016-08-25,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,We ordered from the Vegan menu. Yes they have special Vegan menu. We ordered roti with green curry it came with bowl of rice. It was delicious roti was crisp. Next we ordered pad Thai noodles with vegan sauce. The noodles were little oily but the taste was very good. There was no room for desserts but we inquired and they have or can make 3 out of 5 desserts vegan. Something for next  Time.,_n3S06MZ7FiTS7Fe1bK_rQ,0,0,5,TE8lp-gYsvERSbKY_-he8A

177980,2016-08-28,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"It is very unfortunate that I have to change my review from a 4 star to 1 star. When we first tried this place out, we were in love. They have the best spring rolls I've tried throughout town, and our server was very sweet. After the past two experiences I have had there, it pains me to say that I'll never come back.

Food - still good. It's nice that they add a separate vegan section to their menu, and the spicy herb bed tofu was very different and flavorful, but when I order a 5 out of 5 and was able to eat it with no rice and taking only a few sips of water, I'm not trying to be a badass. You are doing something wrong. However, as far as flavor goes, it is very yummy here.

Service - This is the entire reason we will not come back. One of the servers there, whose name I can't remember, and I am sorry for that, is awesome. She's shorter than the other servers that I have seen there. She works very hard for her guests and has a very friendly, open attitude.

The other servers are horrible, all of them. Their hours are posted as closing at midnight, but if you show up at 11:20pm, they announce that they're already closed, will seat you begrudgingly, make you order before youre even sested, toss your food onto the table, and rush you out of the door. It is a horrible experience for someone who walked in 40 minutes before they close. Not 10 or 5 minutes. 40, and we were one if four tables in there.

But every restaurant gets a second chance rule, which is why we came back. We had our awesome server, and the only complaint was the food, until right before we left. My friend had walked up to our server to hand her a cash tip, and another server interrupted her and snatched her cash out of her hands. Look, I am a server. I know how things work behind the scenes. I can spot which servers actually care and which servers are low and sheisty. She, who was the same server that rushed us before, was sheisty. She didn't even serve us and yet she still grabbed, actually snatched it from my friends hand, a tip from another table? Argue that they may split tips, it is still very, very rude how she handled the situation. As a regular customer, I don't think I've ever felt so uncomfortable and unappreciated.

Thai table lost 4 customers who used to dine there weekly. I would suggest looking up Komol for a more authentic, spicy, innovative thai food experience with friendly service.",L8yMLcRg7L7JZX80l6jRBA,0,2,1,uqPB3CuBM_L302Y7vsGK0g

392470,2015-01-08,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"I am a HUGE thai foodie. With that being said, I found Table Thai through Yelp, quickly placed an order for delivery and was very satisfied with what I got! Upon arrival the food was still warm as if it had come straight from the kitchen onto my dinner table. The driver was very nice and even gave me some free thai iced tea for ordering delivery. 

Food:

- The first thing i got was a yellow curry. For the price it was a bit small portioned but really satisfied my hunger. The sauce was excellent and had a bit of a kick to it (i got a medium) and had a VERY generous amount of meat in it. The flavor was excellent as well as the consistency; not too runny, not to thick. This came with your choice of white or brown rice. 

-Second, I ordered the pad thai. Once again this was on a scale from not spicy-spicy. I got a medium but the flavor was not spicy at all. Anyways, the noodle were very flavorful and all around good. They came with chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, egg, a lemon, and peanut topping.  

-Thai Iced Coffee. Enough said. It was absolutely amazing. 

-Thai Iced Tea: Simply amazing. Wow.

Overall, this was the best delivery thai I've had. 5/5 would order from here again.",2hnmM6kh0O2wwkmGuT5Bwg,1,0,5,CppoYs71-bxeLa0B2bTpTw

Tip: ask for a coconut when you sit down, you'll be happy drinking coconut water out of a coconut - then eating the meat from the inside with a spoon! (Ask them to shave the sides for you though, as sometimes they don't. Unless you're up for a challenge with your meal.) the menu features veg and vegan options, (ask if other things can be made vegan, my favorite is Tom Kha  Kai as spicy as possible with tofu made vegan.) there are special plates/boxes, and as always, if you've never had one - you MUST get a Thai Ice Tea (only if you have a sweet tooth though.)

The decor is pleasing and the dim lighting makes it feel intimate.  It's a little thrown off by the giant TV mounted in the corner, but I know some people need that during their meal.  We got seated next to a decorative barrel, which I ended up bashing my elbow on several times.  I'm not an enormously tall guy, but the seating arrangement next to the decor was not doing me any favors.

The service was not promising at first.  There was one waitress for the entire restaurant and she was dedicating all of her time to the large party sitting a table over.  Once the other girl came over to help us, service improved.

My wife ordered the Spicy Basil with Tofu, which they unfortunately made with chicken.  Not wanting to be wasteful, she ate it anyway, because she would feel worse about the chicken going into the trash.  It had a good flavor, though not the best Spicy Basil we've ever had.  She also got the Tom Kha soup, which was super yummy.

I got the Crying Tiger.  The sauce was flavorful, though the meal felt like it was missing something.  It was just a bit too much ""here's some meat, enjoy!""

We stumbled on Table Thai Bar & Bistro (TTBB) on a delivery site I will not name because they serviced our neighborhood. I hadn't realized I had had visited and thoroughly enjoyed TTBB before. I've stumbled on this place two times now and been pleased both time.

Everything we ordered was delicious. While there is a great deal of Thai food in Vegas, what I haven't seen much, is a eye toward vegan options. That's why we chose TTBB and that is why we will continue to come back. They dedicate a sizable portion of their menu to vegan fare--but it gets even better. From what I saw, many of the noodle dishes can include ""soy chicken"", ""soy beef"", or tofu. For those of us looking to reduce/eliminate animal protein in our diets, having proteins that extend beyond tofu is exciting.  And yes, I know that soy options may not be ""healthy"", but they provide plant-based eaters options when dining out.

We ate the gyoza, fresh rolls, pad see eiw, pad thai, and yellow curry. While I didn't love the texture of the noodles in the pad see eiw, I know that the noodles did not get a fair chance to impress us after traveling across town in a delivery car. The large chunks of carrot inthe curry were a little daunting, but after tasting the flavor of the curry I let my concerns go.

The orange chicken was not good. The chicken was thinly sliced and battered but not saucy or crunchy. It could be because I had it delivered so it had time to get soggy. The chicken is fried and served with a side of orangey dipping sauce.  Not great.

We have tried most of their curries, and many of their noodle dishes, but the pineapple/shrimp curry (if I'm not mistaken) is my favorite.

Luckily, Table Thai is the same great service, tasty food, and elegant decor. Either they're still affiliated with the same owners, or this location is just lucky. 

The DUCK ROLLS are a simple but tasty app, much preferred over the GREEN PAPAYA SALAD- menu said this came with shrimp, but the $9 price tag yielded only two, and I found the dish rather lackluster. Opted for the SPICY BASIL FRIED RICE with chicken, per other rave reviews and liked it- a 3 will get you good heat, and this contains an ample portion of protein. But the MANGO STICKY RICE was a winner for both flavor and presentation, featuring toasted sesame seeds that added a whole 'nother dimension to this classic dessert.

Since I was at the coffee shop for a couple hours and it was already lunch time when we left there, decided to stop by and check out this place for their lunch specials.

Lunch plates are offered between 11-4pm and the prices are under $10 for the 18 different entrees listed. Comes with a clear broth soup with a dash of black pepper seasoning. Also choice of steam or brown rice. Nice that they don't up charge you for brown rice!  They had great entree choices but I chose my standby dish; Yellow Curry Tofu to see how it measures up to the other Thai places. Unfortunately it was just okay for me. I was a little bummed out. Oh well.  The seasonings were not present and the curry was weak IMO .  The rice though that accompanied my order was cooked perfectly and I ate that all.  And I normally don't finish my rice!  I am impressed that the lunch portions offered are a pretty good size for lunch meals.  More food than lunch plates offered in other places.

The menu is an interesting read. Thirsty Drink,(for drinks) Sweet Lover(aka desserts), Hot & Warm,( Spicy and Mild I think they meant)  but what's Health & Healthy? I do appreciate the menu is organized into sections which made it easy to read and quick enough to zero in to what you are hungry for.

Even though my order was messed up initially, service here is great! The staff is really nice and my orders came out pretty quickly. I DO look forward to coming back here again.

Stepping foot into Table Thai Bar & Bistro amazed me, the interior of the restaurant was an outstanding sight. It looked very modern and the decor and furniture tied in with the modern culture of today's society. When the waitress greeted us, she was very polite and our first impression of her already gave us the perception of great customer service. Our first dish was an appetizer, Shumai and Papaya Salad. It was very fresh and delightful. Our second dish was an entree, Grilled Lamb Panang. The lamb being cooked medium, made the meat very tender and moist. The panang sauce matched very well with the exquisite meat. Afterwards, we enjoyed the Deep Fried Fish with Red Chili Sauce. We thought everything was amazing but this dish caused me to be ecstatic. The flavors were so splendid and went together so strongly. The deep fried fish was boneless and the sauce was not too spicy; the basil had a strong dominant taste that tied everything together. Last, but not least, don't forget to order their homemade Thai Tea. The sweetness was perfected and the tea was very delicate, but bold. Unfortunately, we did not order dessert due to all the delicious food we had eaten, but hopefully you try their desserts because I don't doubt that it isn't as amazing as everything else. I could doubtlessly say that everything from their presentation to the actual meal, was stunning. Overall, I savored every bite on my plate and every sip being drank.

Dark, dim interior - and open late. Prices for entrees/main courses are pricier than other Thai eateries , but I liked the ambiance and the way they cook the food here - so I didn't mind !

Food-wise , try the Crying Tiger or the Thai chicken bbq - my old-time favorite here is always the pad see ew. Their spice level is from 1 - 5. They have various hot sauces and peppers as well to give your meal that extra kick ! You have to ask for them though since they keep it in the back. They also have excellent dessert. They're the only place I know who serve Thai tea crepe cake , my favorite.

They have a menu for lunch specials from 11 am - 3 pm , cheaper and same portion amount.

Service is always great , the waitress was very kind and always checked on us to make sure we have enough water , (since we were probably sweating our eyes out).

2287083,2016-07-29,1,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"After reading some good reviews and being recommended by a close friend, I decided to give Table Thai Bar & Bistro a try. I visited in a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant only serves dinner. The parking lot locates in front of the restaurant so just a few walks to the door. The front door is neat and clean with clear business hour on. Exotic decorations such as elephants which are the symbols of Thailand, Thai ladies wearing traditional dresses and some paintings show the culture and landscape of Thailand. The dining room was almost full by the time I arrived, I was surprised that most of the guests were with their families so I would say this is a kids-friendly restaurant or a perfect place to have family gatherings. There is not a full bar in the restaurant since the size of the restaurant is rather small but I noticed there is a long rectangular table in the middle can seat proximately 8-10 guests. 
 The restaurant only equipped with 2 servers that day so after it opened, guests arrived quite at the same time so we waited a good 10 minutes to get someone to order the food. I order the Lamb Panang curry because it's rare to see Thai restaurant serves lamb rack or lamb chop in curry sauce, compared to Indian cuisine. The presentation was excellent with a pinch of thai spice on the edge, and some lightly fried mint leaves underneath. I smelt coconut milk in the curry and the distinctively gamy smell of lamb. The spicy taste was on point and met my expectation with a slightly salty finish. My taste buds were covered by the pungent curry flavor and a naturally sweet coconut milk came afterwards. The lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare with tender and juicy pink center. A little bit crispy at the edge and the small amount of lamb fat added the unique texture to the dish. Plain asparaguses were not seasoned or added flavors so they can balance the strong flavor created by the curry and lamb. Asparagus itself is crunchy, fresh and sweet, it helped me to cleanse the palate and get rid of the excessive spicy taste. Overall I enjoyed the food that I ordered. This is a restaurant well worth to try and return.",dJkSiYHzMpZwNoYcZphsng,0,0,4,U57MXR61BV1F2rtJcvxGKw

Mixed Veggies with Beef $7

Everything was great! The soft shell crab and mixed veggies dish came with soup, rice, and salad. As another reviewer said, the portions they serve is just right and its a good deal.

2336838,2017-10-03,1,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"How this place got 4.5 stars on Yelp! right now is beyond me. I came here with my dad one afternoon for an early dinner and the food was so bland, it felt like the greatest waste of money I've ever spent on Thai food. Granted, my family is Thai so we are more on the critical end of the spectrum. 

Firstly, when I spoke to the waitress in Thai confirming whether their yellow curry noodles was ""khao soi"", she said it was so I believed her and ordered it, since it is one of my favorite dishes. My dad ordered pad see ew since that is how he judges a restaurant on how good this simple-to-make dish is. When my noodles came out, you better believe I was disappointed. The curry was too light and bland, with vegetables that did not belong in there and the noodles were almost like ramen noodles, not khao soi noodles. My dad's order was tasteless, missing key components of a proper pad see ew, like garlic and Chinese broccoli. I can let go of the Chinese broccoli because it can be hard to find depending where you live, but how do you forget garlic in a Thai stir fry dish?! Oh, I almost forgot, the noodles in the pad see ew were old too because they weren't soft as should be. Overall, this place was a huge disappointment and severely overpriced for the quality of food. Never coming here again and telling all my friends to steer clear of this place as well.

2347043,2017-10-22,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"I've probably been here 6 or 7 times total and the last two times there were issues. Yesterday during lunch it was busy so the three of us lunch gals got a big table and ordered promptly. 2 orders came out with about a 5 minute delay for the third order, not nice since being polite is waiting until all three of us can eat. After we were finished our plates were cleared and we waited a very long time for our check, we actually had to wave someone down despite the rush being gone. Typically it wouldn't be a big deal but a lunch rush is just that because people have to get back to work. 

The time before that, I was also on lunch with a different friend and I laid with cash. The lady brought my payment back AND the change so I made money for eating there. Of course I have the money back and told her but there wasn't much appreciation. Perhaps they need to have more staff during lunch due to the recent issues. One thing is always consistent.....the food! It's always great but service is huge and it seems to be going downhill. :(

This place is a little hidden, tucked inside a shopping center right next to Sunrise Coffee. The inside is very nicely decorated, with some of the most comfortable couches/chairs I have ever sat on in a restaurant. The restaurant has a level of elegance that makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy restaurant without being overwhelmingly stuffy or overpriced. 

The staff were INCREDIBLY friendly and attentive. My water glass was never even half empty. And they were more than ready to offer suggestions when we were struggling to pick what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded so good.

We ended up ordering the Season Rolls, Tom Kha Soup, Drunken Noodles with Chicken and Massaman Curry. First, let me say how happy I am that a place is finally combining egg/spring rolls with summer rolls on one appetizer. I always want to eat both, and usually have to pick, but the combination is a great idea, and I wish more restaurants did this. The soup was delicious, and a HUGE portion. Not only does your bowl get filled, but the container with extra broth on the side means you get the equivalents of two bowls of soup. The noodles weren't bad, a little too heavy on the onions, but otherwise no complaints. The curry was definitely the star. Awesome blend of spices.

First star removal: no wine and liquor? Why not?  But yet there's the word ""bar"" in your name. By all means, I'm no alcoholic. I actually can't stand the taste of alcohol. My boyfriend simply wanted a glass of wine to go with his dinner. They're been open for what?.....about 6 months now? Or more? Why are they still waiting for their liquor license? 

Second star removal: the food. Just wasn't very tasty. Bland chicken + shrimp pad thai. Not flavorful at all. And only 2 shrimps!?! For a dinner sized entree!? I ordered the chicken thai basil fried rice. Definitely didn't look like FRIED RICE. It was more like mushy rice. The rice was all stuck together and it was kinda.....soggy....if that makes sense. Maybe the rice was under-cooked? Chicken was dried too. Tasted even worse as leftovers and I am NOT a snob when it comes to eating my food two days in a row.

2707034,2017-09-14,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"This place is probably one of my greatest disappointments. I was so excited to move close to a thai place that delivers but Table Thai ruined that almost immediately. 

My husband and I ordered the yellow curry, garlic lamb chops, lazy duck, and mango sticky rice with thai tea to drink. The overall food portions were ridiculously small and over priced for okay flavor. The yellow curry chicken was the most flavorful dish with some spice but every other dish was bland and lacking. The duck needed sauce. The garlic lamb chops were tough and in need of spices. The thai teas were (in my opinion) way too sweet but when the ice melted down they were good to go. 

All in all, I will only ever order desert and beverages from Thai Table and nothing more. I will not visit here or recommend it to anyone for a meal. 
I honestly tried to give this little joint the benefit of the doubt and encourage you to do the same if money is no object and unflavored food in tiny portions is your deal.

Once the order was delivered I opened it up and found it drowning in chicken. I called table thai back and told them my order was incorrect. They told me that because I didn't say no meat, even though it says there's no meat, they add whatever they think for meat and it was my fault for not saying no meat....the description clearly read no meat! Noodle, tomatoes, basil, and spicy garlic sauce! After arguing with them for almost 10 minutes they finally said they would send another order. About 10 minutes went by and they called me back telling me that my order was on the way and they want the other order back! Can you belive that? Who does that?! What are they going to do resell it? I have the order still obviously but really!! Who asks for a order that was made wrong back?...I will never order from them again.",2gRFMS0c1d4LONLKFCt0iA,0,0,1,7tkcMVz9Lw9qtyI87ZadEg

I was sincerely pleased with Table Thai. With so many Thai restaurants here in Vegas it is hard to find one that is accommodating and affordable, meanwhile tasting delicious! I chose Table Thai after passing by it on my way home several times. I should mention that I am a vegetarian that prefers vegan options. Table Thai had a variety of options as well as were willing to customize my food to my liking. For example Pad Thai is traditionally made with both egg and a fish sauce, which I do not eat. Needless to say, all my food including the Pad Thai, was Vegan! When I got home I was really excited to see the presentation of the food. Furthermore, it was absolutely delicious.

Their menu also includes an assortment of appetizers, salads, curries, soups, rices/noodles, grilled items, healthy options and chef recommendations.

The service was great. Our waters were kept filled, everyone was really friendly and welcoming and they explained to us that they've been having issues with the licensing and other new business paperwork problems since December is a big holiday season and it's been hard with many offices closed and whatnot. But they informed us that as far as they know they'll be open for good now :)

Now for the good stuff! The nums! Me and the boyfriend decided to go with their lunch specials which includes soup, mixed salad and your choice of white or brown rice.

BBQ chicken: This is what my boyfriend ordered. Super flavorful, maybe a little too potent of a flavor for some if that makes sense lol has a rich sauce and you can definitely taste a grill flavor. 3.5/5 for me, 4/5 for Mr.Kitty.

Red Curry: I went with the shrimp version and it was perfect. A good amount of shrimp, good consistency of the sauce, not spicy which I usually prefer but the flavor was definitely not lacking. The only thing, there was an extreme amount of bamboo shoots. I personally don't care for bamboo shoots but if you like them, it would be heaven for you lol. 4/5.

Lunch special soup: flavorful clear broth and I loved that they added two pieces of shu mai which were soft and fluffy. A really nice touch for complimentary soup.

The atmosphere is still cozy with a modern twist like how it was when it was called Taiga. Overall, a different twist on many thai favorites at a very reasonable price. We'll definitely be regulars! Next items I want to try: Pumpkin shrimp curry, Crying Tiger, Steamed fish chu-chee, Panang soft shell crab, Spicy Basil, and Brulee Cheesecake!

Although the restaurant is on the small side, it's nicely decorated with comfortable seats. I remember seeing 2 or 3 TVs. We were given water right away. We decided to go with the orange chicken lunch special ($8) pad Thai lunch special ($7) and pad see ew ($10) because we thought the lunch special portions would be small. 

They started us off with a small bowl of vegetable soup that had one wonton in it. The meat was pretty tough so I didn't really care for it but the broth was flavorful and sweet... ( I'm hoping there isn't a bunch of msg in there). My friend really liked their soup.

Our food came our quickly and the orange chicken portion was pretty big. The pad Thai portion size was smaller and the pad see ew portion size looked ok, but we were too stuffed to finish anything. The spiciness level in both noodle dishes were supposed to be at a 2 (out of 5) but I felt that that pad Thai was more of like a 3.5. I had to pick out a bunch of (fresh) chili pieces out. Also, the color of the noodles seemed to be very... orange. I wasn't a huge fan of the pad Thai. However, the pad see ew was delicious! Best pad see ew I have ever had. It was perfectly seasoned with a hint of sweetness. Also, the beef was super tender. My friend enjoyed her orange chicken and also really liked the pad see ew.

The decor is nice and the seating is very comfortable. They have a few TVs on some of our favorite channels so that was a big plus. The waitress was very nice and quick. 

The menu is pretty standard, and veggie options were pretty good. We ordered the vegan curry and fried basil rice with no egg and just veggies. They both came out relatively quick. The curry was a pretty small portion and we were both confused about how a veggie curry could be more expensive than the meat and fish curries...(minus one star) the mushrooms were really cold. Which was weird, because everything else was steaming hot. The curry is standard mild spice so make sure you ask for more heat if you like it spicy. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't super great. Over all, they have some awesome lunch specials that both of us would be willing to go back and try, but as for dinner and the price, go to komol or Nitayyas.

Fantastic food, good portion sizes, and fair prices for the quality. 
-The cucumber salad was awesome, fresh and came with lots of onion, carrot, and pepper. Not too sweet but instead just good spicy flavor.
-They gave me a complementary seaweed salad that was great. Peanuts onions and more. If not on the menu yet you should ask for it.
-My pineapple tofu red curry was one of the best I've ever had. Full of flavor with onions, pepper, basil, bay leaves. You can add the complementary little chili flakes, chili paste, and jalapeno for a major kick. It didn't need the add-ons, I took a few sips of the broth and nibbled through it I wanted to enjoy each drop.
 
Great service! Patty is a legend! I was greeted, seated, and brought water quick. Got my very good and large ice tea fast which comes in a glass mason jar. I was already stoked at this point. 
The kind server asked if I had been there before, I said no, and she was actually happy to offer suggestions and go over the menu. She asked what I liked with a genuine smile on her face the whole time and you could tell she cared.
Many customers got hugs when arriving and she got told I love you from several people! Haha.

They have great vegan options. It took my boyfriend and I some serious convincing that the Orange Soy Chicken was indeed vegan because it tasted so real.
So, so good. 
Most places that substitute their main dishes with a fake meat alternative usually ends up too dry. Not here, they're fake meat is unreal. (No pun intended)
Even adding soy chicken in with the yellow curry is really good, too.
It's expensive, but you get what you pay for in my opinion. I never leave feeling like I didn't get enough to eat.
I could drink 45 of their Thai Ice Tea's in one sitting. 
And the garlic fried rice...I've legitimately had dreams about it. Don't ever ever ever leave here without having tried their freaking garlic fried rice.

Overall, the food is fantastic. 

But the best thing about this place is the staff and the atmosphere.
I would go in here everyday after work and they ladies that work here became some of my very dear friends. I never left the place without a hug and without having some good laughs.
And they treated me just as kind when I was a brand new customer.

This is a small restaurant.  I arrived between 5:45 - 6:00pm.  There were very few people there, but I was okay with that.  The seats had style and were super comfy.  This is the place to go on a first date.

We ordered the wonton soup, Pad Thai, and Crying Tiger.  

A small bowl of wonton soup is $6.  They deliver the dumplings, veggies, and shrimp in the bowl and pour the broth from a mini pitcher at your table.  Very unique way to present your wonton soup.  The flavor was quite different because it had a sweet flavor to it.  Overall, the soup was delicious, but I'm used to the traditional unsweetened and salty broth flavor.  The soup includes pieces of chicken, shrimp, bok choy, carrots, and ofcourse, wontons.  

The Crying Tiger is slices of grilled ribeye for $12.  It came with a side of small (I think some kind of chilli oil) sauce.  It was a bit dry and on the bland side. 

FInally, the Pad Thai.  It was a bit on the greasy side.  The Pad Thai was big enough to share.  The server didn't ask how spicy we wanted the Pad Thai, so that's probably why they brought it out with a spicy level of 0.  The taste was pretty bland too, but it's nothing that Siracha or hot chilli oil can't fix.  

The ambiance is nice, the presentation is nice, but the food itself tasted a little bland.  Overall this was a good experience, but it's not my favorite Thai place in town.",SVcQ8yqaLDmjMwPRDwQPaA,3,3,3,1BqZV33VlheWMcE5COOKRg

VIBE: cozy with wooden accents, tufted chairs, crown napkin folds. The atmosphere resembles something more native to that of the downtown LV joints -- trendy, but without the crowd (yet). Another indicator of their hipness is the fact they serve their drinks in mason jars. Yes! I had a thai tea and my sister had the thai coffee. Pretty to look at and a generous portion, for only $3. Young coconut for the same price. Sweet deal. Please don't ever change this!

SERVICE: Our waitress was attentive and frequently asked how everything was going. Our dishes timely cleared, waters were constantly filled, though my glass had a small water stain. Side note: Although the name suggests a bar, I didn't really feel like it's much. They do offer wine and beer, though.

FOOD: To start, my family had the Asia Sampler (a combo of shumai, shrimp, satay, spring rolls), but I'd suggest just getting the shumai by themselves, as the other three weren't anything special. We also got the shrimp tom yum soup -- Drained all of our sinuses, spicy, but in a good way.  Our main dishes: duck curry, yellow curry, asparagus with shrimp, teriyaki chicken, pad thai, and pad see ewe, all ranging from $9-$13. Some came with either white or brown rice. My favorite was the pad see ewe. Although they use the good chicken, the yellow curry seemed a little watery and the potatoes weren't tender enough. For dessert, we wanted to try the thai tea crepe cake, but it wasn't available. We settled for the mango with sticky rice and some coconut ice cream instead. Hit the spot. Great presentation.

If there has even been a restaurant in my over 50 years of dining experiences that deserves a perfect score, this has got to be the one!

My wife (who is native Chinese) and I dined here a few hours before a flight out of Vegas.  We entered the restaurant hoping for a decent Thai restaurant experience (where our previous Asian food experiences in Vegas have been awfully disappointing!).  Having experienced an exceptional meal here, we left the restaurant seriously depressed that we lived out-of-state and would be unable to return to this restaurant again often!

First and foremost, the waitress/hostess was ENTHUSIASTIC about her work.  She was extremely friendly, helpful, and genuinely cared about our dining experience.  She spent a lot of time telling us about their best dishes (more than a dozen) and guided us in making good choices for our meal.

Second, the atmosphere was very pleasant, tasteful, and elegantly casual.  It was a serious step up from the austere outside view of the strip mall containing the restaurant.  Everything was clean and organized with care and good judgement.

Finally, the food was top notch!  We ordered Tom Kha Gai soup, Phad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and Red Curry with ground pork.  All three were excellent!  Thai food is our favorite cuisine.  So we are quite experienced with these food choices (both in the USA as well as in Asia).

The Phad Thai was slightly sweet as it should be (but not overly sweet as found in many other restaurants) with the right amount of fish sauce (not too salty) and the right amount of spice heat to make it memorable.  (The only odd thing about the Phad Thai was that it was served with a lemon slice and not a lime slice.)  The soup was perfectly blended (not too ""limey"" or too ""coconutty"") and served above a flame heat.

The red curry was the most memorable of all!  I *LOVE* curry!  This curry was the most deeply flavored and rich in flavor (but not too thick or too thin in consistency).  Like most restaurants, Table Thai gives you the choice of meats including chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, tofu, and more.  What is not like most restaurants is that they also offer ground chicken, ground beef, and ground pork.  We ordered the curry with the ground pork and found it to be a revealing experience!  The ground pork provided much more flavor to the curry (but not fatty or oily)!  It reminded me of the first time that I tasted Thai food so many years ago.  I remember the excitement of new and wonderful tastes that I had never previously experienced.  This red curry with ground pork gave me that same new experience!!

Wonderful!  My wife and I cannot wait until returning to Vegas in the future solely for being able to eat at this restaurant!!

I ordered the pad thai with chicken and shrimp which looked really good because it had a nice glazed appearance due to the tasty sauce (I hate it when places serve pad thai that looks dry and dehydrated!). I also got a good amount of shrimp (more than 3 pieces!) and chicken. Check out the picture to see for yourself! The quality of the dish as a whole was delicious and I would say it is on par with Naga (although my friends prefer Naga a bit more than here). One advantage this place has over Naga is the fact that their portions are bigger so you get more bang for your buck. 

I would definitely come back here if I am craving Thai food since I had such a good experience. The staff is nice and attentive since they kept refilling our waters without having to call them over. The prices aren't bad and are worth it because of the quality and quantity.

I don't know if it is new management or a new chef, but the food and the service have taken a serious dive. We noticed the change in November and waited until tonight to try again, just in case it was one off night. Nope.

We always ordered the same things: pad see eiw, panang curry, and pineapple fried rice. It used to be the best in town. But now, the panang curry is way too thick and the flavor is off. It used to be so creamy with the perfect balance of seasonings and coconut milk. I can hardly stomach it any more, and the chicken is far different from the thin and juicy slices they used to have. The pad see eiw has come out cold both times with too little sauce and tough beef I can hardly chew. The pineapple fried rice had chunks of balled up rice and no flavor. The spice it totally unpredictable. Consistency is key with any food but mostly when it comes to spice level. You never know what you're going to get.

There used to be one girl working here that was phenomenal. I don't know if she is still with the place, but I haven't seen her. She used to be there every time we came in. It probably would have been better with her here. The new staff is short and seems to try to ignore you.

3652371,2015-09-11,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"Took my wife here on her lunch break this afternoon. This place managed to get us well fed and on our way in under an hour which is a pretty great accomplishment in itself.

But that was the thing that impressed me least.  This restaurant is a modest little space tucked away in retail center that you might miss if you aren't looking closely. The parking lot is tight, and often full.  

I'm not sure why, but the restaurant only had a few other tables when we were there during the peak lunch hour on a weekday. I can't really complain though, the place was quiet and provided the perfect atmosphere for an afternoon lunch date with my wife.

The place is impeccably clean, and well put together. The decor is less like a traditional Thai restaurant and more like a modern bistro you'd find in an urban restaurant district.

We had two different servers waiting on us, making service as quick and efficient as we could hope for given the circumstance. 

I love Thai food, but I can't say I've been the most adventurous when it comes to the menu at most restaurants. Poke fun at me if you must, but I usually get pad Thai, garlic string beans, or basil chicken. 

I tried the pad Thai here, which proved to be an excellent choice because it was one of the most enjoyable renditions I've ever had. Not too soft, with a bold, well-balanced smoky  flavor.

I'm not sure why, but I always request the highest spice level (5 at this restaurant), and Thai restaurants never deliver the heat. As with every place, the server asked me if I was sure if I wanted it so spicy, and when I said ""most definitely"", I was brought a mild dish. Maybe they've had too many past experiences where people have requested full spice and couldn't handle it so they didn't want to risk having to remake any more food. I don't know, but when I say I want it hot, i'm not playing games!  No worries though, like all great places, Table Thai has a spice assortment of powder and sauces to kick up the heat of the food to your liking.

My wife got the yellow curry chicken, which she seemed to love, and while it did look delicious, I don't enjoy curry so I can't comment on the flavor of her dish, except to tell you she enjoyed it immensely.

They serve an excellent Thai iced tea in a mason jar glass, which adds an interesting touch to the classic drink. Very nicely done!

The food and drink portions were enormous, especially for a lunch special, which is an impressive $7 meal that includes a soup and salad.

The only item I didn't care for was the soup. It was a little light on flavor in my opinion: a simple broth/onion soup with broccoli and a dumpling. I almost feel bad griping about it because it came with my meal so I didn't pay any extra for it and my wife seemed to really enjoy it.

Overall, I think Table Thai is one of the best Asian restaurants I've tried so far in Las Vegas and I'm so glad we found it!",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,3,0,5,NhRY8zsggQ7z0Ji52VFYVw

3872810,2016-03-09,6,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"After two visits to Table Thai and a couple of lunch deliveries to my office, I feel comfortable saying that it's one of my favorite Thai places in the valley.  Table Thai is located on Sunset between Pecos & Eastern, a couple doors down from Sunrise Coffee.

The interior is surprisingly warm and welcoming for a strip mall spot.  It's not large, about 10-12 tables that get packed during lunchtime.  Some of the tables have plush chairs and benches, some have wooden-like chairs; all are comfortable.  There are also a couple of large TV's mounted on the wall if you want to watch while dining.

Our service has been exceptional thus far. Everyone here is friendly and accommodating.  Our server was refilling our water glasses before they were even half empty, courses came out quickly, and everything was hot and fresh.

My most recent visit:
Tom Kha Soup with Shrimp ($12) 5/5 The broth is so complex and delicious that we kept taking 'just one more spoonful' even though we were full. 
 
Green Papaya Salad ($9) 4/5 So fresh and vibrant.  Delicious and a nice palate cleanser.

Spicy Basil with Shrimp ($14) 5/5 I love that their Spicy Basil is comprised of large pieces of vegetables and protein instead of ground up like a lot of Thai restaurants.  I think their 3 out of 5 heat rating was a little too spicy for me (I might be a wimp).  I got a 2 out of 5 when I had it delivered and that was just fine for me!

Pad Thai with Shrimp ($10) 3/5 Tasty, but nothing special.  There are far better choices at Table Thai in my opinion.

Spicy Eggplant with Tofu ($11) 4/5 Very similar to the Spicy Basil with the addition of eggplant.  This one was ordered at a 4 out of 5 heat rating, so I only sampled a piece of eggplant and a couple peppers because it was hot!  But what I did have was very good.

Thai Tea Crepe Cake ($7) I don't want to rate this one because the consistency was gross to me, but the Thai Tea drizzle was delicious.  Everyone else in my group of 5 loved it.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,11,8,4,wc8D5Cm43X-dSKkFpcYDTw

Tonight, I finally tried Table Thai Bar & Bistro, the ""new"" restaurant at this spot. They're much more focused on Thai food, with a little overlap into Chinese cuisine and possibly Vietnamese, and they seem to have impressed several of my Yelp friends. One of my friends from the Taiga era pulled up the listing when I said that I wanted to go somewhere new to write a review, although I probably would've insisted on something a bit fancier if I'd realized this would be my milestone 700th.

Then again, I've always liked the more affordable and approachable restaurants, which Table Thai definitely is. They have two televisions that were set to Monday Night Football on ESPN, which tonight so happened to feature my hometown and favorite team the 49ers. The music is quiet piano/instrumental stuff, which is relaxing and not at all bothersome. The servers were good and kept refilling our water.

Since I was aware of the lunch specials, I deliberately avoided ordering items on that menu in anticipation of getting better value on possible future visits.

For an appetizer, we shared Duck Rolls ($8), which is basically two fresh-tasting spring rolls w/ duck meat and a delicious sauce.

For my entree, I picked Pad See Eiw with beef ($10), which is definitely among the better renditions of that dish and has plentiful beef, some egg, and... wait, normal broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli? Well, it still gives the right veggie crunch, so it's not a terrible substitution, just an inexplicable one. My chosen spicy level of 1 (out of 5) was fairly subtle, and heat-tolerant eaters probably won't detect anything.

My friend ordered Crab Fried Rice ($15), which had tasty crab meat and fresh cherry tomato among other ingredients. He got it with a spicy level of 2, which was very noticeable but not sweat-inducing for me. It's not too greasy as far as fried rice goes, and I could see myself ordering it again after having had just a couple of bites.

We also shared a dessert, namely the seasonal Mango Sticky Rice ($7). Fresh, sweet mango and hot, sweet, glazed rice balls with a slightly crunchy topping (plus a couple of maraschino cherries for garnish) definitely hit the spot.

Yes, there will be future visits to Table Thai Bar & Bistro. It's a good (albeit very dim at night) restaurant with plenty of menu left to be explored. And yes, there will (hopefully) be 700 more reviews to come.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,17,12,4,an9W3gvOsIvOQgxNolnKsw

Location: Table Thai is located next to Sunrise Coffee. The interior is very intimate and elegant, with no more than 20 tables throughout the entire restaurant. It is dimly lit and very quiet, perfect to take someone out on a date.

Food: 
Thai Tea (4/5): Decent Thai tea, but not the best I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was just my drink, but it tasted a bit watered down.

Jade Curry (3/5): I had ordered the Jade curry with tofu and spicy level 7. I honestly was not impressed. You can order this with either brown or white rice. Though the portions were big, I could not help but notice how watered down and oily-looking it was. After wanting Thai curry for so long, I was left disappointed in my dish. Be careful about spice levels if you do not eat spicy food often. I would recommend no more than a level 5 if you are not used to spice!

Service: Staff was friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and was able to ask all our questions.

With the abundance of Thai restaurants popping up all over the Valley, Table Thai ranks average. I would come back if I was around the area, but next time I crave Thai food I will probably end up giving another establishment a try.",Nv3PWqYZ47GQuG0p8u4uQg,2,0,3,EDTAsOHncr33A0uMhMwkQw

They were quick to give us to go boxes and let us each walk up to the register and pay individually (they would not give us separate checks).

4352935,2018-04-17,1,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"I spent a long time contemplating my thoughts on this place,  and after several times getting take out, I feel it's time to give it a review.   A large part of my hesitation was based on how disconnected my feelings were about the food to the star ratings they had accumulated.  I kept waiting to be wowed,  and find an item that I found cravable.   

The only item I found that I really enjoyed was the crab rangoons.   The wrapper is fried just right,  has a great crunch,  and the filling has good texture,  not just one note cream cheese.  Also their dipping sauce pairs well.  After that everything becomes either average, or below... 

The first time I came here I got their chicken satay. While it was tender the amount of peanut sauce they give is very stingy.   It is also more of a curry base and less of the more creamy coconut some places have.  The cucumber salad is also more liquid then salad. Last, but not least several bone fragments were in my chicken,  which I have never had anywhere.  I found it odd so I contacted the business,  and I will say they have very good client recovery.   They apologized,  said this was an isolated incident,  and offered a free chicken satay to prove so on my next visit.   They also threw in a free rice and Thai tea.   I was impressed with their customer service. Also,  thank goodness never have I had another bone incident.   I also made sure the other times when I ordered on line to ask for no jalapenos in my salad, and they were always great about modifying. Still flavor wise I prefer Thai houses chicken satay. 

I found their Tom ka soup OK the first time I went when I got it with tofu,  however when I got it with chicken the second time it was to salty,  and the chicken had a weird texture. 

The pad seew was really disappointing,  no dimensions in flavor, and the second time it looked like they cooked egg seperatly and just tossed it on,  so it was not coated in the sauce,  just super weird. Their was another flat noodle dish that my boyfriend tried it was on the spicier side, so while the flavor was good a 3 out of 5 was to hot for me to eat more than a bite of.  So keep in mind at least that night they  definatly ran Thai hot. I normally like thai tea to cool down the the heat,  but theirs is to sweet,  and not very flavorful. 

They do have a vegan menu which I know some will appreciate,  although I have not tried it. Also,  one of the reason I gave so many chances was they are open about an hour later than most Thai places near me. I really want to like this place more,  maybe I'm not ordering what they are known for.   Until I figure out what that is I'll just keep ordering here when my normal spots are closed.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,2,2,3,rsKGzWaRqOu0OhrJlqApaA

It took me about 10 minutes to get there and my food was waiting when I arrived. Looking around the restaurant as I paid I was impressed with the inside of the restaurant. It has a clean, modern feeling. 

The Pad Thai lunch special was calling my name. It came with a nice portion of pad thai (choice of chicken, pork, or beef), a vegetable egg roll, and a green salad. From the menu it looks like dine in lunch specials come with soup too. Even without soup I ended up having leftover pad thai for the next day. I really liked the flavor of the pad thai dish and the chicken. The green salad had a nice dressing and I enjoyed the flavor of the egg roll too. I would definitely order this dish again.

The lunch specials are an amazing deal. There are 16 different options for $7! Yes, $7! Even with tax and a 20% tip I made it out for $10. I can't think of any places in town where you can find a better deal for a quality meal.

Sweet & Sour Chicken: Ordered in order to take to lunch the next day. Same deal as the orange chicken. Extremely small to non existent chicken deep fried in too much breading. I ended up just throwing it away because of how unappetizing it looked after the orange chicken.

They ordered the Orange Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Chicken which are two items I am a huge fan of and I don't know if it was the breading or the sauce was different, but they thought it was ok to not really liking it.

I tried it even though it is not on my list of approved foods to eat right now and I even thought is was less then ok.  The breading was very soggy and did not have a good taste to it and that goes for both chicken dishes.

This is a place we probably enjoyed trying once but will not be on our list to visit again.  There are other places which are just a few steps better and worth going back to.  Sorry to say this is not one of them.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,1,1,3,qN3dW6oD9Ndv23H8xYA4AA

Late night Table Thai and Bistro filled my tummy with happiness and warm, authentic Thai cuisine. After watching Muslims shoot Christians with machine guns at the local theater, Randall and I had worked up quite an appetite. All of the standard favs were closed, so we rolled the dice on this gem. Upon arriving, we noticed the small sign in the window that read ""vegans welcome"". This was almost as refreshing as the young coconut we ordered. We also had the soy orange chicken which was FIRE.

The owner and staff went out of their way to host a wonderful multi-course meal all while having a very fresh atmosphere that all of our guests really enjoyed.  We were able to order a bunch of different menu items that many folks had never tried before.

4654909,2016-04-23,6,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"Whenever I walk toward the entryway of Sunrise Coffee I have a tendency of looking up at the low flying airplanes ready for landing at McCarren International Airport. A couple of weeks ago, for a change I decided to look down where I set eyes on the Table Thai lunch menu. Where the adventurers in the airplanes were about to land this adventurer was about to take off on a flight that carried me to an interesting dining adventure. My dining adventures at Table Thai would be my first. This marks the first time that I have dined in a Thai restaurant solo. This review reflects on my two food adventures in Table Thai this past week.

  Both times that I ate here, it was off the lunch menu. Everyday, Table Thai serves a lunch special from 11 AM to 3 PM. The prices range from $7 to $13. The majority of the lunch specials include mixed salad, rice, and wonton soup with a glass of water with ice. I'd order the barbecue chicken on the leading visit then pad thai on the second. Further into this review, I will talk about them in further detail. 

  Upon walking inside, I was surprised to be surrounded by an upscale interior. I expected a take out environment. A friendly lady, I believe is one an owner, walked me to a table by the open kitchen. We walked on a new brown floor that the lady would joke with a customer that you can dance on it. Forget about wanting to dance, it would be hard to want to leave the comfortable booth seat. First off, the waitress put the glass of water and ice on the table. I ordered a Coke ahead of the meal. The waitress opened a can of Coke that she poured in a glass of ice. I failed to see hot tea on the menu. After she poured the Coke, I ordered the barbecue chicken. There was around a 15 minute delay before the freshly made lunch arrived. I entertained myself with the Internet compliments of the complimentary Sunrise Coffee WiFi next store. 

    The barbecue chicken lunch plate was 1/4 entrée, 1/4 rice, and it seemed 1/2 mixed salad. The barbecue chicken was quality over quantity. I enjoyed every bite to the bone. This chicken would leave a nice aftertaste that is a sign of using quality ingredients. The rice was allright. The brown rice I ordered looked more like white rice. And tasted like white rice. The wonton soup came at the same time as the meal. It featured one wonton, broccoli, and peas. After lunch, I decided to return to try pad thai. 

   My second visit was a more adventurous lunch. This was the first time that I dined in a Thai restaurant by myself. This is the first time I partook in a meal with only water. And it was one of my leading times eating pad thai. This was more of a genuine Thai restaurant experience than the last. What is a good Thai restaurant experience? According to McDang a well known expert on Thai cuisine, the food must have intricacy; attention to detail; texture; color; taste; good flavor; and the use of ingredients with medicinal benefits. My pad thai met McDang's expectations with the exception of ingredients with medicinal benefits. The pad thai lunch was $7 and included wonton soup, mixed salad, and water. The pad thai occupied 70% of the plate. My protein was chicken. I told the waitress to make this stir-fried rice noodle dish with a 4 out of 5 spiciness. The pad thai was outstanding. I did not feel the 4 out of 5 spicy. Maybe I have a tolerance to spicy food. Regardless I know great food when I taste it. 

  Based on the two visits, just like the barbecue chicken the experience left me with a nice aftertaste. That means that I might be back. If I return here, I would order the pad thai over the barbecue. It appears that pad thai is one of Table Thai's signature dishes. Then again I might further extend my horizons and try something totally different.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,14,4,FIsISJ5ZyTcZwo550ffekQ

I would rate their food 3/5, honestly. During my last visit, I ordered tom yum soup with shrimp & the yellow curry with chicken. Something was off about the tom yum. It tasted... sweet? I was very confused lol but I got a spicy level 3 out of 5. It wasn't bad at all, it was just sweet. The yellow curry was alright. I've had better at other Thai places. I've also tried their pad Thai before & wasn't impressed. Maybe I just haven't ordered the right thing?? I really want to like this place since it's so close to my work lol. I don't wanna venture off too far. Maybe I'll keep trying different menu items.

If the chicken had been thoroughly cooked it probably would've been perfect. I would just rather not risk that experience again or bother risking salmonella/food poisoning. 

I won't be back to say the least. If they make sure their meats are thoroughly cooked I'm sure it tastes great. Just a risk you gotta take I suppose. I just personally can't stomach raw chicken.

I plain out told her that it wasn't tasty or spicy. She said,""oh, ok. Next time, save room for dessert."" Wow.",oz8Zao60WZofs4qzCz4uSg,0,0,2,OznqMk_i1etb-LrVuh8zBQ
4934418,2016-08-03,1,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"This place is one of my most favorite Thai Restaurants.  When I think of Weera, Kin Thai, Siri Thai, Sakun Thai, Naga, Gaati, Komol, Lotus of Siam, Lucki and all the other places in town, I love coming back to Table Thai Bar and Bistro.

1. Service - The staff here are very nice and friendly. You always feel welcome here.  they are very attentive and making sure you are taken care of. Even when it is busy, they are available.

2. The Food - The food here is great.

Lunch - For about 7-10 dollars, you can order 1 of about 10 specials from curry to spicy basil or pad thai.  Your will have a nice lunch size serving of the dish, as well as soup, rice and a small salad. I find that this is a great deal and the amount of food is just right.  Great food, great flavor and great price. Can't beat that.

Entrees - They have just about any and all Thai dish that you could want.  I won't go into any great details as the choices are similar everywhere.  Here are some highlights though:

Ground Meat - I love to have ground pork on my Thai dishes and some places have it, and some don't. HEre they have the ground pork. It captures the sauce and spicy flavors so much better than larger cuts of meat.  The best part, is that they can do ground chicken as well.  I generally prefer the consistency of the ground meats in Thai cooking. Not many places can do ground pork or ground chicken!

Tom Yum - I always enjoy it when the soup comes out in the soup hot pot with the fire in it steaming. Here it is just right and slurpiliciously good.

Vegan Menu - Many places will have a vegetarian menu, but here they have a separate Vegan menu. That is great, especially since the daughter has been a vegan now for about 5 months.

3.  Ambiance - The amount of tables, the design and everything about this very small restaurant is just right. I love coming here with the family and also on business lunch meetings.

GK says, check it out. One of my favorite Thai restaurants.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,5,9,5,Zlwl4JljrFIFa898oHteyQ

Tonight, however, I ordered the crab rangoon, beef salad, and pad Thai. The crab rangoon was good, always one of my favorite dishes to eat. The beef salad was too sour. Almost too sour that I couldn't eat it, when I love to eat sour! The beef on the salad was so tough! The pad Thai was overly sweet and the chicken in it was also very tough. I did not enjoy my meal at all and neither did my boyfriend. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of the food.

Everything we ordered was delicious and served to our room in less than the 45 min wait we were quoted. The food was still very warm and each dish was delicious. You can order the degree of spice you wish and we found a 2-3 out of 5 to have a bite but was not overpoweringly hot.  
We had the ShunMai which were amongst the best we've ever tasted. The pad see eiw was prepared with delicious thin, wide noodles in a gravy with broccoli ( and we added tofu). It was much lighter than many of the noddles you often get with this dish.  Finally the yellow curry was superbly flavored.

5085080,2016-08-12,4,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"Thai is always great for lunch because of the lunch specials. With that said, this place gets busy with the work lunch crowd. Price point is pretty good at under $10 with common dishes like pad thai and yellow curry ranging from $7-8. 

I can't remember the last time I had pad thai, but I have been craving it for awhile. I'm glad I was able to try this place because their pad thai is really flavorful! Is there still a lime shortage? They serve this dish with lemon instead.  The sides that come with the lunch special are salad and won ton soup, which were average. 

I sampled the yellow curry, which I was not all that impressed with. It was watered down and oily. Less flavorful than other Thai joints. 

Another disappointment was the thai tea crepe cake, which tasted nothing like thai tea. The color was the only thing that looked like thai tea. The texture was nice and overall a very light and not too sweet of a dessert. 

The interior is clean and modern with lots of natural light. Our server made us feel rushed, like trying to clear plates before we were done kind of thing. Otherwise, not too bad. Food came out quick and our waters were never empty.

You can tell they did not hold back the budget to make sure people were seated very comfortably. I appreciate the touches. Now let's get to the food. 

I think that for Thai food to be priced really high you better make sure you are adding those extra touches that make you feel like you are getting your money's worth and they did great in that area as well. 

The only critique I have is again I'm sorry but when it comes to Thai food Im very picky about it so for me to give a 4 star rating means they are good enough to come back to.

5367289,2016-01-05,2,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"This was a pleasant surprise. I was on my way next door for coffee (*rise) and as I parked I thought, I'll just have a late lunch (2:30). From the outside, this place is much understated and truly unimpressive but as you enter, you immediately realize the owner put a lot of thought into making this place comfortably chic and more upscale than most Thai restaurants.  The venue is well lit, large windows with enough tinting to make it very comfortable and clean. I cannot emphasize enough how clean the place looks.  

Lunch pricing is lower than average at a great value of $7-9!!  This is only reinforced by the more than reasonable portion size.  This place reeks of great value, at least for lunch.  Considering this is my first visit and my first review of this restaurant, food-wise I would only read into this ""lightly"" until a couple more visits.

The food came out within 3-4 minutes of my order. Therefore, on the onset, service is awesome, the kitchen fast (perhaps too fast--I'll explain later), the staff very engaging and attentive; giving you enough space so as not to crowd the guest and are ""invisible"" in a positive way.  They filled my beverage (tea/water) without notice.

The disappointment - this is the gist of it. After all we go to restaurants to eat.  Therefore, if the food isn't what stands out over the ambiance, then the place is just, okay.  The brown rice was sticky and pasty; a clear sign that it was past its time in the rice cooker.  My order was as basic as it can be for a first time visit--Broccoli Chicken.  As I mentioned earlier the portion size was generous, at least 8-ounces (easily 5 oz of chicken).  The chicken was cooked well.  The vegetables, soft and over cooked.  The flavors over all were spot on; sauce was delicious.  Here is what I suspect they do in the kitchen: the base -- veggies and broth sit in a pot. They flash cook the meats (chicken, beef, pork or shrimp) per order and throw that into the base at plating.  This unfortunately makes the cooking unbalanced.  Say what you would about the P** W** chain but, theirs is cooked to order.  All of it, to order, each time.  Therefore, the veggies are not soggy and it only takes 3-4 minutes more.  I don't think anyone would balk if the kitchen takes 10-minutes to put out your lunch order. After all you can pass the time with the soup that comes with the meal anyway.  Also, the salad greens were Iceberg lettuce instead of a leafy mixed green which has more nutritional value but hey, it is under $8!! This place would better serve their customers if they par-cook the veggies or just keep the stock separately and compose the ingredients upon each order.  I'll give this place another couple of tries for dinner and perhaps with a larger group to experience it on a better day.  Every establishment is entitled to a bad day.",6_OsfMU6GhlnhKE1g28r9g,3,2,2,N-oss-DjmIn1TPmxOTWvEQ

We ordered pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, garlic and pepper chicken, and the Crying Tiger for dinner. The shrimp in the pad Thai and fried rice were huge and had a good serving in each dish. The pad Thai was delicious! The sauce had so much flavor - you could really taste the tamarind, fish sauce, limes, etc. and they put plenty of it on the noodles so they weren't dry. Definitely a must order! The fried rice was authentic Thai style fried rice and packed so much flavor in such a simple dish. The garlic and pepper chicken was the favorite dish of the night. The sauce on it looked so simple yet the flavors were so complex. It had the sweet, the salty, a bit of spice and tang. I would eat just that sauce with a bowl of rice and be satisfied. The Crying Tiger was our let down. It's a rib eye with a kind of spicy vinegar dipping sauce. The sauce was good but the steak itself was so chewy and was cold when they brought it out to us. Wouldn't order it again. 

We also ordered a sweet roti and mango with sticky rice for dessert. The roti was perfect with a crispy exterior and soft, fluffy interior and was sweetened with just enough condensed milk. The mango and sticky rice was also good. The mango was ripe but had just a touch of tartness which matched well with the sweetened sticky rice.

5392699,2018-05-17,0,Lzv68iVkRHstVvW3aXNWkA,"We have been coming here since they opened and the food/service/cleanliness have always been consistently wonderful.  Even carry out is always top notch.  

I have found it hard to find Thai places that are consistent in their spice levels, but the folks at Table Thai always get it right.  

Some of our favorites over the years:
Pork Larb - the menu only shows chicken, which is yummy.  But you can ask for pork if you prefer.  The pork is still juicy and the larb has the right amount of lime juice.  I like that they provide lettuce leaves to eat it with.  If I had to make a negative comment, I wish they provided more lettuce leaves.
Panang curry - We have had this with pork, chicken, duck, and tofu.  I prefer it with the tofu, hubby prefers the duck, and the kids the chicken.  The curry is wonderfully rich and a perfect balance of veggies, protein, and spice.
Jade Curry - This is a lighter curry than the panang and always so tasty.  We prefer the chicken or pork but have even had it with beef.  Always a good ratio of veggies, protein, and spice.
Yellow Curry - the menu describes the dish with dark meat chicken.  Prepared that way, it is delicious with huge chunks of juicy chicken.  But you can get it with other meats, my son prefers the beef.
Crying Tiger - This is the only thing that I think the portion size is ""small"" on.  All the other portion sizes are big, even huge.  But this is definitely a ""single"" serving.  It is the only thing we have never had leftovers of.  Great spicy sauce, but they will serve it on the side if you prefer.
Stir-fried eggplant - This is one of our FAVORITE dishes.  Even my children/friends that don't like eggplant love this dish.  It is not what you might expect, because each piece of eggplant is individually battered and fried (very light delicate batter).  We always get it with tofu.  Perfect balance of sweet, spicy, salty... so yummy.
Orange Chicken - Not what you think of when you think of orange chicken.  This is not the heavy over sauced version you normally find.  Instead it is light and refreshing, but still filled with orange flavor.  
Pad Woon Sen - again, many restaurants use too much oil in this or are too heavy on the noodles vs everything else.  This is perfect flavor, ingredients, texture of the noodles.
BBQ San Set - I like this because you get a quarter chicken, sticky rice, and papaya salad.  The chicken is so flavorful and moist, and the papaya salad is a welcome light refresher.
Fresh Spring Rolls - This is the best version of spring rolls I have ever had.  Again it is about the ratios, some places put too much noodles or lettuce.  Some don't provide enough dipping sauce or it is too thick.  Most places don't put enough shrimp.  This is the perfect balance.

Other choices, hubby loves the crab rangoon.  We all like the four seasons (i think that is the name) as well as the duck wraps.  Tom Kha Ga is huge, we are always too full to eat our food when we get this.    We also like the Lad Na and the Pas See Ew but again it can get a little heavy since it has the wide noodles and it is hard to not eat it all.  

I don't think we've ever even made it to dessert because the portions are so big and the food is so tasty.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,2,0,5,HfdXQ_xObMCNUut5zETMrw

We were seated immediately at a table by the door when we arrived and were given excellent service by our server for our entire meal. Contrary to many other Thai places, our server was very amiable and gave us good recommendations even assisting us with the right spice level for our food. I'm not afraid of heat and can handle just about anything. But when I ordered 3 out of 5 spice level for our food, she immediately put me in check and said I should order 2 out of 5. I'm glad I did because the spice level was just right for everyone. All of her other recommendations were solid including: recommending the barbecue chicken when they were out of the teriyaki chicken for my daughter and her friend, dark meat instead of white for our curry, and not letting us pass up on dessert.

The menu consists of your usual Thai dishes with a bonus vegan section and chef recommendation section. Our usual shrimp rolls ($8), tom yum with shrimp ($12), and yellow curry with chicken ($11) were all up to par with the curry having a more depth of flavor with other spices compared to other places. 

My daughter and her friend polished off the barbecue chicken ($10) and they gave us plenty of white rice as we needed it through our meal. I had the panang soft shell crab ($19) which the crab was fried perfectly and accompanied by some crisp asparagus and panang sauce. But there was just a little too much sauce, including on top, which drowned the crab. For dessert, everyone split the mango sticky rice ($7) which lasted about 3 minutes on the table. The tart and sweet mangoes with the sweet rice was a great finish.

We were definitely impressed with just about everything about our experience and there's no doubt we'll be back.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,7,5,4,7yYEb92DT_Fdmm0ClkuMpA

We use to drive 15 minutes to our favorite Pinkao Thai on Eastern by 215. Now we go here around the block , open late

My wife and I eat out to classy and reasonable reastaurants, this is one of our favorite place, price reasonable

Management and staff are our friends now,
I'm not sure about take out, I prefer to eat in. 

Hope to have them here forever and good luck on their restaurant

A centerpiece of this establishment is Patty (unsure of how she spells her name.) She seems to thrive on serving and making everyone happy. She was zipping around from table to table, and I wish I knew what vitamins she took (ha ha). 

Being my first time here and assuming they would get the order to the right table, I didn't pay attention (my fault) to what I was served, although a different server announced what it was as she brought it to the table. When I asked after a few scrumptuous bites if a spicy shrimp salad came with the salmon I had ordered, it was discovered that it belonged to the nice couple at the next table. I was told to keep the salad anyway no charge. Patty made sure the couple got extras to compensate for the wait, and the wife told me that Patty is always like that. When I had to have my leftovers boxed, Patty gave me fresh rice and a yummy, and as she pointed out, healthy Thai Tea to replace the regular iced tea I didn't get to finish. My order of Garlic Salmon was so yummy I will order it again (if you don't mind it being sweet, try it.) But I also want to try other items on their menu.

However we were not positive, but it was enough to keep us from coming back. So tonight I was in the area and felt like pad Thai. I decided to give table thai another shot...I was initially shocked when I was charged 12.99 for vegetable pad Thai Togo. I would have never ordered it had I known it was going to be so expensive...by time I saw the price it was too late because I had called in to order Togo and they never told me my total before we hung up. I suppose that's my fault for not asking...I left a $2 tip because I am in the service industry and everyone who works here is super nice. So the vegetable pad Thai was pretty bad...it smelt and tasted like fish and they gave me lemons rather then the limes I had requested. I couldn't even finish it, so I gave the rest to my mom.  Without me even saying anything about the fishy odor and taste my mom mentioned how it smelt and tasted like fish. She thought there was fish in it. Now that to me is pretty gross. For the price and quality I won't be coming back again.

NOTE: after checking the menu just now I have noticed the pad Thai is only $10...still over priced for bad food, but I will be calling and demanding to be refunded and charged the correct price. I'll never come here again. Done.",CwYLTJU9eKbQOTlzYO9FdA,2,0,2,oVnHpz_ALAuZt6Qp2mP-qw

I had the lunch with the salmon jade curry, which is basically a yellow curry with salmon in it.

The amount of salmon in the dish is not stingy, though I do think it is farm raised salmon. There were also some veggies in the dish.

They do serve alcohol now, I saw several asian beers available and some sake as well. 

Service was excellent. I believe the owner seated me and took my order. Very nice lady. The food was excellent as well, I ordered my standard crab rangoon appetizer, and Pork Pad See Ew. The crab rangoon had a really good orange citrus sauce that looked homemade and not from a jar. Excellent taste!

The pork pad see ew was also delicious, cooked well and the stir fry sauce wasn't too sweet as I've had other places. Complimented the flavors of the pork, noodles, and egg instead of overpowering it. Like I said, it was the best I've had in Vegas and I've eaten at a lot of Thai places.

The Beef Pho did not have the traditional thin Vermicelli noodles that I was expecting. Instead the noodles were wider and flatter, and the broth had a sweet taste to it.
