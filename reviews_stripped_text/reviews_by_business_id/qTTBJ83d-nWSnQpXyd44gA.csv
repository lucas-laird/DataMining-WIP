11073,2017-12-31,0,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,Very disappointed and astonished to be told when we arrived  at 8:30 on a Saturday evening that the kitchen and the restaurant was closed for a private party.  We had looked at their website before going and there was no indication that they were closed that evening to the public; the hours they were open showed until 10:00 p.m. Saturday.  Been to many other ethnic restaurants in town which still serve the public when they also host private parties simultaneously!,PuSYuusSE37hLZI2DHjbVQ,0,0,1,Kx1KoxdBJy31cPCHqg-l2A

2 years ago, I came to Vegas for the first time and I was looking a Mediterranean restaurant. I found this restaurant on yelp. It was newly opened but the taste and quality of food was so delicious, so i had all my meals in MAZA during my vacation in Vegas. Also, the owner was so helpful and intimate that he gave information about Vegas, clubs and casinos. He even suggested some other restaurants from other cuisines. After this great taste experience, I came to Vegas 2 more times and on each of my trips, I went to MAZA to have my lunches and dinners. I also took my friends to MAZA, they were amazed by the great taste and hospitality. We were like in our home and had great time in MAZA. On the other hand, the employees are awesome! Jessica, the manager, she was very helpful and hosted perfectly when the Owner, Kamil was not in the restaurant. The cooker, Ege, he is an amazing young guy with great cooking talents. He cooked the kebab exactly as i wanted. The waitress, Lila and Serbian guy, they were smiling intimately, not insincerely. Ibo, the service guy, he even came to talk to us. And Kamil, the owner, he is an awesome, friendly, chatty guy.. I really enjoyed my conversations with him. In my last trip, I saw that they developed their business and they have new dishes in their new menu which the photos of each dishes. Also, the owner brought a another cooker from Turkey and started to serve pide and lahmacun which are my favorite fast food in Turkey and they go further and now they order a stone oven to cook pide and lahmacun.  Lastly, they use Halal meat which is important for me since I care my diet and health so much. Basically, MAZA Restaurant is a perfect place to have Turkish Mediterranean food. When you go there you have not only great food but also perfect friends. I strongly recommend you to go there. I wish they were here in Monterey, CA. Maybe, one day, they will.. ;)",2Uw2NMpImb_8Mox7OePwyg,1,1,5,47ec0b2GpaZrcsBbSlORYQ

161071,2015-06-27,2,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,"I know my Mediterranean food (Thanks to living considerable time in Petersen, NJ) and Maza food at the best was mediocre. We ordered couple of Combo Kabob & The food was flame burnt to give cooked look but lamb and chicken cube was absolutely not cooked at all in middle.

I prefer my meat medium to medium rare but both chicken and lamb were rushed fast flame broiled (dont know why, most of resturant was empty anyway).

To tip the experience off, they ring ""automatic"" 20% gratuity for a food which we didn't enjoy eating. Mind it, it was party of 2 and never I experience that you get to charge 20% gratuity on 2 people. I know it's groupon and supposed to be saving so shouldn't be big deal to pass it on to them, but tip is prerogative of customer based on service / food & I absolutely dont feel like tipping them 20% for this calibre of food.

The chicken Kebab on rice pilaf is consistently delicious and on point every time. Sometimes the lamb is a bit chewy and the beef kind of tough, but both are still delicious. Just a little bit below the chicken Kebab for consistency. 

Service is always great, every portion of my meals has always been fresh. $10-16 for any of the Kebab's is money well spent. The Gyros are pretty good as well but I haven't ordered one in a while.. as you can tell, because I love the Kebabs!!!!!",hUrc4ZcncposttqD2x7h5w,1,0,5,GrHHBl0sNtaWaXIdrzq3rA

These all had great flavor and textures to them. I ordered the chicken kabob and he got the sampler kabob. Both were large portions and came with pita bread and rice pilaf. Then our meal was rounded out with baklava and the offer of Turkish tea. We declined the tea and put our leftovers into a box for later.

we waited and approximately 25-30 minutes later the server brings us a Chicken kabob plate for my wife. My wife did not start eating and just waited for my plate.

1600320,2014-12-15,2,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,"Wow. Probably the tastiest kebab I've ever eaten.

The seafood kebab comes with juicy lump of salmon and flavorful grilled shrimp, as well as the shiny grains of rice and grilled tomato and chili. The tomato-based dipping sauce has intricate but not overpowering flavor that complements the simplicity of grilled stuff.

Tried both lamb and beef, and while both were really good, lamb will remain as our fix. Hummus was great, too.

But I cannot end this review without mentioning the most surprising find: Baklava.

Whenever we tried baklava in the past, it was always too sweet to the point that caused a headache. We never liked it. But as this place offered baklava as a check-in bonus, we decided to try on a whim - and glad we did! The baklava had a delicate sweetness and texture, and the flavor of ground pistachio completed the traditional Turkish pastry. Also, we ordered a couple of chai - comes in the traditional cute little cup - at no charge!

One major letdown was that the both times we visited, the table cloth was not clean, and the paper table cover didn't fit with the shape of the table in a booth, and kept making friction noise all the time. Interior design could use some sprucing up.

When those issues are solved, I can give them five stars!",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,4,3,4,sunf5CLJSJuXUiIzKN4wUg

When I am at a Mediterranean restaurant, I expect a sandwich to come on pita or lavash, this bun was way too much bread! 
The meat was of okay quality but sandwich was not served with any sort of sauce, just peppers, onions, and tomato, which gave the dish almost a fajita feel.
Option of rice or fries for my side, picked the rice, which was warm and soft, but after eating the sandwich breading, I couldn't take any more carbs.

They never brought us side salad that we were supposed to get with our meal. We actually ordered coban salad, they never brought that to us either. When I reminded the waitress that we had ordered salad, she offered to bring it but we were almost done with our meal so I didn't want a whole salad. I was still super hungry since the meal wasn't good at all so I asked if she could bring me a small coban salad. She said she can bring a small house salad (that we were supposed to have gotten anyway) The salad she brought tasted like wet lettuce. It was so bad. I asked for some dressing thinking it'll help with the taste, the dressing she brought us was just oil. So, all in all everything we ordered was HORRIBLE.

However, it wasn't a great meal. They put everything in a Styrofoam box, so the french fries were completely soggy (I wish more restaurants would use paper bags for fried foods that allows foods to stay crispy). The beef was over cooked to well done (site says they do medium well).

Ordered the chicken shawarma and beef wrap. Both were good. The fries that came with both were cold though (note I ordered from UrberEats, therefore I'd expect them to be cold I guess - even though my house is 6mins from you). Well done on both items not being soggy though. 

But wtf is up with the rice pudding? Having had rice pudding from many other Turkish restaurants over the years from all over the world I sort of had the expectation that they are all the same i.e. good. Thing is too, rice pudding ain't too damn hard to get wrong. But look at the picture of what I received... I thought it was melted cheese or something? Then as I realized it was a burnt rice pudding?!? Why is it even burnt? Oh and no cinnamon. 

Look I feel silly - which I shouldn't be - complaining about $3.95... but this ain't right you guys. Take it off the menu and don't have this crap available! What's really dodgy here is that I rang you guys too, straight away upon receiving my order to ask what was up and the lady's response was ""well they know what they're doing"". Well guess what, not with this particular item at this particular time. I mean seriously, look at the picture again and tell me they got this one right.

Combo kebab platter and chicken kebab were good. The meat was seriously tender. I did not say it was seasoned but it was nicely tender. Rice was good. Tomatoes were undergrilled. There was no grilled onion on the plate. I was sort of lost as the onion should be my companion in every MidEastern meal.
We chose to try bakhlava.
They serve two pieces on the plate.
It was dry and without sufficient honey. Definitely cheaply prepared. My husband's father made home made delicious bakhlava and the version at Maza should not be the reason for your trip over here by any means.

3623030,2014-12-27,4,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,"When it comes to chicken kabob, yes this is as good as it gets! 

FYI: My review will solely be based on their kabobs.

For $10 - $13, you'll receive a side salad or fries, rice, meat of your choice, a grilled tomato and pepper, and pita bread. At most Mediterranean restaurants, I'll go with the beef adana (long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled) cause it's the safest and pretty consistent at every restaurant. I don't like to go for the regular kebabs because they're usually dried out or over cooked. Maza is the first to prove my kebab assumption to be wrong. 

My first time at Maza, I was on my no carb diet and I wanted to be healthy so I went with the chicken option with no rice and extra salad..a very unexciting meal in my opinion. My friend chose the rice option and I was instantly salivating when they brought it out. They provide a Lebanese style rice with cut bits of vermicelli mixed in - very similar to a rice-a-roni mix. Now as for the chicken, if you know me well, you know that I NEVER order chicken at restaurants because people always like to overcook chicken and dry it out, and I'm not a fan of white meat. However, at Maza I was happily surprised that the chicken is like what Sheila G. said, ""BUTTAH."" I hate this word but it must also be said, the chicken was sooo MOIST. It's the only thing I order here now. I microwaved the leftovers two days after and you know how sometimes when you microwave meat it just gets tougher cause you're basically cooking it again? NOPE not with this chicken! It stayed tender and just as good as the first night.

I've ordered the lamb kebab, beef, the beef adana, and they're all good as well, however my top choices are the regular lamb and chicken (obviously). The beef wasn't as tender, so if you don't mind gaminess... go for the lamb!

Cheese plate appetizer - sliced moist Bulgarian feta with piles of fresh herbs like
                                         Basil, dill, mint, and also some green onions
Sampler Appetizer - hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, and dolmas
Chicken kebab
Veggie kebab
Combo kebab
Beef shwarma

The appetizers were delicious. I was especially impressed with the giant piles of fresh herbs served with the yummy Bulgarian feta on the cheese plate.  American feta is more on the dry and crumbly side, so we appreciate restaurants that serve the moist and creamy Bulgarian type. This place got my honey to try mint and dill leaves for the first time too, and he enjoyed it! Score! The sampler appetizer was  fantastic. We enjoyed the hummus and dolmas, and I was hooked on the tabbouleh salad. Baba ganoush was yummy too.

On to the main course....  We each ordered kebabs. Every thing we ordered was seasoned perfectly and was served beautifully on the plates. All of the meat and veggies were grilled with skill as they were so moist. The grilled veggies had the perfect amount of charring on them. All dinners come with some grilled veggies (tomato, onions, and jalapeño), jasmine rice or fries, and a salad. We each had salad and rice. Salad was delicious and had a unique dressing. It was light with good flavor and we enjoyed it. The jasmine rice was amazing. I  usually forego the carby side dishes, but I couldn't keep my fork out of this rice....super yum!!!

It's worth noting this places does not have a liquor license. However, don't let that be a deal breaker for you, as you can BYOB. We will be doing that for beer and wine next time. There is also a convenience store in the same parking lot you can run into to in case you forget.

The service was exceptional and the food was just ah-mazing! We had the Maza sampler  and for our entrees, we both had the combo Kabob. We should have braced ourselves, I know but the babaganoush, hummus, tabbouleh and sarma were so good we could not stop eating. Add to that the warm pita slices. By the time our entrees came, we were pretty full. The lamb, beef and chicken pieces were so moist, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The last time we were here, the chicken was a little dry, this time everything was cooked perfectIy.  Personally, I still prefer the lamb and beef. It even seems like they gave us more meat or the pieces got bigger. Even the salad was huge. Not complaining though :) .

We have been to several Mediterranean restaurants in town and Maza makes the best chicken kabobs, marinated so tasty and juicy and cooked just right. Had the chicken wrap (sandwich) once and that was really good too. They have groupon and coupons in the flyers for 1/2 off an entree or $5 off or free Baklava dessert and they always take both the $5 and give the free baklava too, bonus!  Plus they give you free Turkish hot tea at end too which is tasty. No complaints except they stop taking restaurant.com certificates for some reason and I still had one (never expire). They were nice and apologetic about it but still was a disappointment. Fortunately restaurant.com is great about exchanging  unused certificates for new ones.

Tasted like canned Cambell's soup with maybe puree'd lentles ... not sure it was pretty bland. No flavor. Wife's Greek salad was just ... meh, okay. Nothing remarkable, can get this anywhere. I had a Gyro sandwich which was cold, not warm. Cold. I believe it should have been warm. It was served with 3 canned pickles on a plate with a small plastic container with an ounce of thousand island salad dressing. Maybe for the limp fries. Greek? I don't think so. The reviews all show decent. Umm ... not even close. Maybe the business does this to generate interest. The owner was there I think. He was courteous to all the middle eastern patrons but us white people he avoided even a welcome. All I know is what tastes good. In a competitive market, quality and at least feeling appreciated as a customer goes a long way. Yes, there are lot's of great choices in Las Vegas so sadly, avoid this place.

I was a bit surprised when we walked in and it was pretty bare, but it was a sunday night.  We were seated by a very friendly nice young lady, we later found out was from the Ukraine so some of the food is worded differently and has some difference.  For instance we ordered Sarma is very similar to Dolmades I could tell the difference in texture, Sarma seamed softer more creamy texture, I liked it a lot better then Dolmades!  The next app was Baba Ghanoush it is a cooked eggplant dish similar to a Hummus or a baked artichoke dip without the high fat in artichoke dip.  I loved it creamy soft with lots of flavors and low in fat with a warm soft fresh pita, Soso GOODgood.

The dinner was as good, we opted for the signature burger Maza Burger, I know strange choice but they made it sound so good in the menu and we were not super hungry it just looked good and it was.  It is not the normal burger I think it may have had lamb in it, it was soft and bold in flavor but the softer flavors blended everything together and the spicy sauce made it a great burger.  It also had lettuce, tomato, a pickled something or other it wasn't a pickle but it kind of was a pickle.  I wish I would have asked I will next time I kind of love pickles! 

My next visit I am going to get the lamb, i was just not hungry enough this time.

The service was A+ she came back a few times even though it did start to fill up as we ate.  I like how she was proud of her heritage and knowledge of food from her reign to explain small details is great detail.

I was very happy and will be going back, it is close to home and easy to pick up, now if they only had delivery...",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,5,3,4,BsXENsWBLNyDaPanSbX2sg

Unfortunately I was really disappointed! My husband ate Iskender kebab which tasted completely like tomato paste and I tried doner wrap which tasted nothing! Sorry I don't want to be harsh but as a Turkish the taste of the food that we tried was unacceptable! I ordered a lentil soup but it was completely tasted like tomato soup again! Why because in Turkish cuisine we use tomato paste as our acidity to taste the food! But in this situation the tomato taste had overwhelmed the real taste! 

About service;
There were 2 waitress and they extremely forgetful! My husband wanted to order extra lavash bread instead pita! (Turks don't have pita bread! It tasteless and so thick) He said they could charge it to the bill! Guess what  the first waitress told us by bringing another pita in the bread basket , "" sorry this is the only bread we have"" ! She didn't even stop by to explain why! My husband got really upset because we know we just order doner wrap in a lavash bread and they should have more! It's like saying there is no hamburger buns at a hamburger place! We called another waitress! My husband told her we want lavash not pita! Then she had an attitude! We heard she was yelling in the kitchen to the another guy ""what can I do they are Turkish and want lavash""  she brought lavash after that but we already were full! The only taste that we like was the maza platter! I would not spend any money here as it doesn't have a real Turkish taste in their foods!

When I told her I needed a table for two, she told me to sit wherever I wanted. If that's the case, then why don't you just have a sign that says ""Please seat yourself""?

My lunch companion arrived shortly thereafter. We haven't seen each other in years so we spent some time catching up.  The server did come by a couple of times, but we were never ready. Then she disappeared. It wasn't busy but she was the only person I saw working. Also, because she let people seat themselves, the few tables were in different corners, which didn't make a lot of sense. Finally we flagged her down.

4484574,2014-12-14,3,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,"Saturday night and this joint was jumping.  There were three large groups holding forth, several other tables were occupied, and three more tables filled up just after us.  It's a big place, so there were still tables to be had, but the blaring music presented by a guy who was part DJ, part singer, and fully master of none :) added to the frenzy of activity.  The music - some Turkish, some American - was sometimes too loud, but not always.

Hubby went in first, but I lagged behind to take in the cold night air for a bit.  Before I could even open the menu, the waitress came to take our order, and of course I wasn't ready.  She attentively returned a couple more times, and then as soon as we gave our order she said she'd be right back with our salads.  That didn't happen.  We waited and waited while the three tables were served their appetizers (we're not big eaters, so we didn't order appys), then their main courses.  

I could have been nursing my glass of wine, but we didn't have any.  Though I had read the Yelp reviews earlier and knew that it was BYOB, I forgot to take a bottle with us, so it was a dry dinner.  I could have been munching on the pita, but we didn't get that until the salads came.  They finally arrived after we asked the waitress to bring them.

In an uncharacteristic move, we both ordered the combo kebab platter, both of which came with salads served before the main course.  That was nice, since it was a larger portion than many Mediterranean places that put it on the plate with the entree.  The light and lemony dressing was nice, not overpoweringly acidic.  What I didn't like was the iceberg lettuce; romaine would have been so much more interesting and tasty.

The kebabs were wonderful.  The chicken was like buttah, so tender and juicy.  My first piece of the beef wasn't as tender, but all the others were, including the lamb.  I liked the interesting touch of the little cup of red salsa (is that the ezme?) served along with the kebabs, which added a little kick, and would have appreciated a small cup of lebni, the strained yogurt that other middle eastern restaurants often include. But that seemed to be available only as an appetizer.  The rice was perfect.  Only the pita was a disappointment, okay when first put on the table, but then dried-out, too chewy, and tasteless. 

We took advantage of the Yelp-baklava offer.  While I'm not usually a big lover of baklava, this one was excellent.  And the small cup of Turkish tea we were served at the end was a very nice and welcome touch. 

Despite the amount of time we had to wait to fill our stomachs, the food was delicious:  well-prepared, not oversalted, and the portions well-sized.  We will definitely go back.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,4,4,UCd3-Y373CUsorMzqe2Mog

The kabob combo was good as well. All of the meat was grilled perfectly and it was all moist. I couldn't really taste the seasoning on any of of the meat.

We were the only ones in the restaurant when we popped in and we remained the only ones for a decent portion of our time there. We liked that it was quiet and I enjoyed the music they had playing.
We had the Falafel, Mediterranean Salad, Hummus, and Grilled Vegetarian Salad. We both really liked that the falafel were warm, and the eggplant spread it sat on was cold. The Mediterranean salad was very good! Unfortunately, our mouths are particularly sensitive to vinegar-y food, so we were not able to fully enjoy it. The grilled vegetarian salad was really good with the pita bread. I didn't have much of the hummus, but we are taking it home, and you simply can't go wrong with hummus. 
Alex mentioned to us to check in on yelp to get the free baklava dessert, and it was not a mistake. Absolutely loved it, and ordered a cup of american coffee to go with. Went perfectly together, and was a great end to the dinner. 
Unfortunately, there were not many vegetarian options. I would love to come back to see a wider variety for those who do not eat meat. 
My boyfriend had some sun shining in his eyes through the window, so he stood up to close the blinds. In doing so, he hit his head on the hanging light. The glass shade ended up popping off and falling to the ground. Thankfully, it didn't break. The servers said it was okay and fixed it. My boyfriend was laughing, but we were both pretty embarrassed. Alex ended up shutting the shade for us, and told us a story about another customer who had an issue with the sunshade as well. I am glad they were understanding.

Service: we had to ask 3 times for Turkish tea... And flag down someone for water and they were so mad about us asking for more water  that they just left the water pitcher on our table LOL they also brought out my boyfriends food first which was awkward because mine didn't come out until 8 minutes after.

5049677,2014-11-28,4,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,"I've been wanting to try this place since we pass it often to and from work. 

While it is labeled as a Mediterranean fare, it seems to be Turkish.

Babaganoush was pretty decent. It was rather creamy so if you like a creamier dip then this might be for you. 

Entree meals came with a salad and that came out first in its own bowl. The serving was generous and I like the simple lemon and fresh herbs that make the vinaigrette. 

Chicken adana kabob had good flavor and texture. Beef kofta kebob could have been cooked less as it was slightly dry though. There was a side of a ezme sauce which is a tomato pepper salsa of sorts, grilled pepper and tomato, onion slices and a few triangles of pita bread. You get a choice of rice or fries and we got one of each which were both good. Everything was simple fare, but solid. 

The baklava was really good. Real buttery, nice syrup and light on spices and served warm. Currently theres a yelp check in for a free square. 

Service was friendly. At first we sat around for a long while as the server got tied up on the phone, but after we were checked on in a timely manner. Then a new server started helping and she was super personable as well.  

I will be back. It was really reasonably priced, fresh tasting and good portions.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,10,7,4,u2qJl_NsbqnyjtG_73Fnng

- Used my Groupon with no issues.
- Lilly, the hostess and waitress, was great.
- Had the Combo Kebab Plate and the Lamb Chops Plate.  I declined the Jasmine rice or french fry options so Lilly offered to make mine double-salads (ie  more salad in lieu of the rice/fries), which was perfect.  I enjoyed the salads and the chicken kebab portion was good.  I loved the beef & lamb kebab portions and the lamb chops.  I don't know how those meats were so tender (via food supplier and/or cooking methods) and they were delicious.  
- Lilly kept my ice water (free) and Diet Coke ($2 and free refills) topped off and checked on me even when two lunch parties (a couple and a group of 5) arrived to the restaurant.  Place was empty when I first got there at noon, but they had tons of reservations for that night.

Our overall experience was an extremely long wait, 45 minutes, with mediocre food lacking flavor. The unfiltered city water had more flavor than the food - even though the water should not have flavor! Time to change that water filter.

The ambience is loud even though it was not very busy. The restrooms were clean and open.

Appetizer:
Warm Pita Bread and Hummus was very good.

Main Dish

Beef Doner Kebab - mediocre and very lacking of flavor. The rce was fantastic. Salad was filled with mostly hard stems and very little lettuce leaves.

Kofte Kebab - We found out 15 minutes after ordering that they ran out.

Switched to Chicken Shawarma - very disappointing and lacking of flavor.

After the long wait, we skipped any additional drinks and desserts.

Service was friendly, but the lack of hostess and seat yourself only added to the confusion - we had trouble finding a clean table and then waited 10 minutes before we were greeted at the table. 

At our departure, our server apologized for the poor service, long wait, and bad food experience, but made no efforts to fix the issue.

My office ordered lunch from Maza previously. We were accessed a nominal delivery fee as expected.

However on our most recent order we were given our total. When the delivery driver arrives we are given a different total. The higher total is due to an additional delivery charge because the driver said ""we are far"" 

You were given the address on the phone. At that point if you feel we are too far (although it's never been in previous orders) then say that on the phone. You don't just take on additional funds without ever disclosing it.

If we aren't in your normal delivery area then why did you bring your menus to our office complex to begin with. Disclose this on your menu so consumers are aware. Verbally say it in the phone when taking our orders...

The lentil soup is different than what I'm used to (more blended consistency) but flavor was great. Both times the salads were lovely - fresh and flavorful. The herb balance with the Mediterranean salad was a standout. Chicken was tender and had good spice blends on it. I think probably the worst thing was the pita. Both times it was thin and dry, maybe over-warmed? Hummus didn't have as strong of a flavor as I'm used to, but maybe I'm just used to over-salted store bought stuff.

It is hard to make a decision. I want one of everything and usually get 2 or 3 things and take home just so that I can have a little bit of it all.  You must try the Knaufe (spelled a few ways) the best in the US so far.  Including NYC.  Just wished they had a Henderson location.  I love Turkish food and I do not know of another Turkish restaurant in LV and just glad that this place has great food, so that I get my fix.",tYOG_NUb3cjN3KGaT9lwbw,0,0,5,u5tIAL6EieTq3oPjxPinfg

The food was good, I got a shawarma and my husband got kabobs.  I prefer a shawarma sandwich on a pita with fresh ingredients. The lettuce was prepackaged lettuce. It would have been better if it had fresh cut lettuce and tomatoes, with a yogurt cucumber sauce. 
The kabobs could have more flavorful. 
All the chicken was  moist just missing more flavor. The pita bread was good, I can't say it was freshly made or prepackaged bread. 
Over all it wasn't horrible, and the staff being so nice would be the k my reason we would come

They didn't refill my water or check on me at all. It took a while to be able to alert the server that I would like my check. In fact, the only thing they were fast about was picking up the bill once I signed, which is bad form.

As for the food, well, good food can at least partially redeem lackluster service. This was not particularly good food. At $14 for the Doner plate, considering the average quality of the product, it is about $4 overpriced. I have had considerably better versions of the same dish. The cabbage side was ok, but the salad looked unappealing with non-fresh lettuce etc.

So, definitely thumbs down. Way down. Almost one star down. Very disappointed.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,2,a1_y-5OhfMoJKRT0rn-OuA

Honestly, the baba ghanoush is probably some of the best I've ever had, but the hummus was less than fantastic.  However, the rest of the food more than made ip for it.

Our waitress, whose name escapes me, was very attentive and gave good recommendations for us.  

I had the chicken shawurma with fries.  Everything was hot and fresh.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the french fries are fantastic, hot, crispy, and seasoned to perfection.

I order take-out and they're always prompt to bring you your food as quickly as possible. A note: the hummus is great but they used not give you extra pita to eat it with, but once it was brought to their attention, your delicious hummus now comes with a hot bundle of pita bread!

5802192,2014-12-24,0,qTTBJ83d-nWSnQpXyd44gA,"This place is about the only place that makes their babaganoush on the chunky side. At most places it comes out looking just like hummus...and it's not very good. Theirs could be better but it's still good as were the rest of the items on the Maza sampler (+hummus, tabouleh, & sarma). 

We also ended up with the Seafood Kabob (we tried to cancel this & swap for the Maza sampler but the waitress cancelled our other order). Which was just as well because it was surprisingly good. The shrimp was well cooked and seasoned and tasted great with this (I think) tomato based sauce). The salmon, which I'm sure was Altantic farmed, actually tasted pretty salmony which is hardly ever the case with farmed raised salmon because it's awful. 

I don't recommend the Turkish coffee. Despite waiting for the grinds to settle some fine pieces remained suspended so it always tasted a little gritty and wasn't very strong. 

I looks like they've got a stage and some sweet light action so I'm not sure if this place blows up at night. We went for lunch at 11:30 on a Saturday and we were the only people in there until another couple eventually came along.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,0,0,3,jSXKoXJckSGfGxOGSHfEXA

That is NOT what is listed on your menu. The chicken kabob was ok, but they served it with rice instead of the fries I asked for. And it is not really a kabob, it is more like ground chicken mashed into the shape of a kabob.

If you are going to try this place I suggest trying dine in, maybe the service and food will be better?
