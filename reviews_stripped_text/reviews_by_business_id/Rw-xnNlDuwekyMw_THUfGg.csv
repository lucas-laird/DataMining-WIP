Hmmm there really wasn't a choice for a quick meal and I didn't really trust the Vietnamese spot next door so decided to grab a sandwich.  Went for the pastrami + egg triple decker and damn it is a huuuge sandwich.  Essentially a pastrami sandwich and then on top of it are your veggies and a fried egg, then covered with another loaf of bread.  

Tasted whatevers.  The pastrami is your generic deli pastrami, and pretty fatty too.  The egg is pan fried but I wished the yolk was only half cooked.  It's over $10 for the sandwich, so a bit pricey, but it is inside a casino, so that's to be expected.  Again, huge sandwich, so you won't feel hungry after that's for sure.

2112317,2016-03-31,2,Rw-xnNlDuwekyMw_THUfGg,"Well during my stay at the Rio I pretty much lived off this place for two days. Am I proud of this? No I am not, but when you have to eat you have to go for what is open and close. So I ran through a few things on the menu and some were good and some were not that great. 

My first run through of the place was I got the Lake Mead. This is a sandwich with corned beef and pastrami. It came piled high and was a $15.00 sandwich. It was OK, it had a couple problems. The meat just didn't feel like quality, in fact the meat was kind of slimy. I would not get this again. For my second attempt the late night munchies brought me to get the massive hot dog. It was good but its hard to mess up a hot dog. But it is huge, might be over a foot long. My final run was the Philly cheesesteak. This thing saved my life from a nasty hang over on a afternoon. It was a $20.00 sandwich but it was the best thing I had from this spot. 

If you are staying here and are in a bind check this spot out. Just be careful of what you grab, I would stay away from the sandwich meat. Go with something off the grill and you should be ok. And I almost forgot, my wife in and I got the Pulled Pork Nachos at like 2AM. They were fantastic, perfect for that drunk munchie hour. If its late and you are buzzed get these freaking things.

Best place for stretching your dining credits for sure. Two people can also easily split many of the meals, so like the $12 breakfast is really $6 each if you're a couple. 

Bowl of chili w/ cheese and onions ($6) - Was the best value in the casino by far, so of course it's off the menu now :(

Two egg breakfast w/ meat ($12) - Huge portions of potatoes, eggs (they say 2 but it looks like a lot more - maybe 2 mutant eggs), toast and choice of ham, bacon or sausage. The ham steak is the most EV+ by far, but bacon is alright as it's pretty good platter stuff and you get four slices ... I'd skip the sausage, you just get two meh-tasting links of meh size. 

Chili cheese fries ($7.50) - Huge tray of these suckers, fries were good, chili barely there though. But definitely big enough for two people to split. 

Pizza ($5-6 per slice, or 6.50 for any slice w/ a small but refillable soda) - Good filling size, it's the style where basically a 1/4 of a pizza is cut into two for a ""slice"".

There was a line but it was small, and seeing the amount of people standing around waiting for their food should have been a good indication of the problems but it was our only option for something quick at this point. We figured we'd order something quick, so we had 3 slices of pizza and split mozzarella sticks. Quick right? Heat the slices in the oven, drop the mozzie sticks in the fryer, should be done in 10 min? Nope. 40 min wait. Once we had ordered, we sat at the table having a beer while waiting. I saw a couple people walk up to order their food, and watched them walk out with pizza, burgers, etc and our number had still not been called!  This happened 3 times.  My bf went up to inquire about it, and he said they grabbed a huge trail of paper from the machine and began fulfilling the orders of those standing around waiting forever for food. It's not a place where you're letting sauces reduce down! It's sandwiches, salads, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, fries...c'mon!  Get it together!

Thirdly, The staff there was also not opposed to me making special requests (sourdough bread instead of a burger bun, well-done fries, and extra ranch.) There is also a ketchup, mayo, and mustard station that is accessible so you don't have to wait in line to ask a staff member for some.

Usually only one line, but when it's game time, it's a long line.  The good news with a longer than usual line is that you're given enough time to decide what to order. 

What to Order?
-1/2 Hot Dog:  Yes it's that big and grilled to perfection. Not a hot dog fan, but you can't watch a sporting event without eating a hot dog.

-Fries: My favorite, steak fries!!

-Onions Rings:  Huge, good, but not good for you.  That's the best kind

-Burgers: Made to order and takes about 5 minutes.  Good portions.  

-Fried Chicken Wings: Probably their best item.  Tasty, fresh, and breaded just right.

Prices are a bit high in my opinion ($10 for a burger), but locals get 25% off and if you have an Total Rewards Card, even cheaper.  

If I'm at the Rio and want that quick something to feed my belly, I have to make a decision.   Do I wait 30+ minutes for the Carnival Buffet or do I get in and out at this deli.  I choose the deli every time.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,1,1,4,cJBg-1w9-_bh_sV7GyaxbA

I got the cole slaw and a drink too.  What's neat about this place is you can watch your food being prepared. They have several of those rotating grills like you would see at the Mongolian BBQ. They have flat top and open flame for so they can cook a burger on the open flame or a quesadilla on the flat top.    I was watching them make my burger.  What was initially disturbing was the patty they put on the open flame grill was precooked and sitting in a container.  They put it on the grill to heat it up and to melt the cheese. I'm worried that the patty will not be medium (pink in the middle) because it was pre cooked.   Amazingly when I bite into it, it's juicy and pink. I would never guessed it was pre cooked.  The cole slaw was a good mayonaise based slaw and it was crunchy enough for me to put it in the burger.  It was an excellent burger with slaw.

Try the meatball sandwich and the spicy fries!!",IBUQnMtXDYR2T_0oaIRV6A,1,0,5,hmu-pLQyubdyRhHJAJFfXA
5167875,2018-06-28,1,Rw-xnNlDuwekyMw_THUfGg,"I was staying at the Rio and ate here a couple days.  The first time it was late but there was still a bit of a line.  Once you order it comes up in decent time.   I got a Greek chicken pita which came with fries that were very good, the price wasn't great, but for a casino it wasn't more than I would expect. The second I got a slice of supreme pizza- a friend got a sandwich and fries which were both horrible.  I think the fries had been sitting around and the pizza was this wet and mushy consistency.  It wasn't crispy at all and there was way too much cheese on top to weigh it down more.  For $6/slice I would expect it at least be edible and I was quite hungry and could only stomach about half of the slice before throwing the rest away.  For a place that basically only does sandwiches and pizza, seems weird half the product is just not good at all.  I would return if I was at the Rio and very hungry at an odd time, but certainly would not go out of my way to eat here again.",OFj6KTUzQaAi-ilVJ1OxlA,2,1,2,zhTptM3KlzfbT__LKbMecw

Next morning instead ordering room service, I went and ordered the steak eggs $15. The steak was thin and I was worried they would over cook it, but it turn out perfect medium-rare. My GF order the bagel sandwich $12 came out nicely done.

5560743,2017-05-02,0,Rw-xnNlDuwekyMw_THUfGg,"After a night of clubbing, we arrive back to the hotel and suddenly a wave of hunger crashes over the group . . . so we decided on Sports Deli and what a bad choice this was!

The four of us somehow all wanted the Chicken Fowl sandwich. 
Wow . . . I guess I either wasn't drunk enough to realize how bad of a mistake i made, or this sandwich was so bad it sobered me up in disgust. 
the bun was still frozen, the chicken was cold and soggy, the avocados were mush, (not guacamole much like thrown into a catcher's mitt mush), the bacon was a strip of grease, the cheese ran away, and apparently the menu noted onions, pepper, and ""sports deli sauce"" none of which existed. 
The fries were crispy, (seems to be some sort of odd trend at Rio restaurants) but again, covered in salt.

Food not bad. The brat and half pound hot dogs were good. The fries were goo too! 

Other than that...it was an okay experience.

I ordered the triple decker sandwich which contained pastrami and brisket. The pastrami was decent, but the brisket killed the sandwich for me. 

The spicy fries weren't really that spicy. It just had a little cayenne pepper. Not really worth it.  You should order the garlic parmesan fries instead.",0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9g,1,1,3,WNZJ6_0HSCTsFXskf4aTqw
