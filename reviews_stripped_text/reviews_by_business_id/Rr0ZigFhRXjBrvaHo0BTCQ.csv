The waitress took our order wrong and she gave us attitude. I have been to many Salvadorian restaurant this by far, this is the worst one. They should be ashamed to call themselves a Salvadorian restaurant.",HDYm7UmTFr9Wh7pE2LRmSw,1,0,1,DMZiDgomOPTMAHb7EIGmtg

1401222,2016-12-07,0,Rr0ZigFhRXjBrvaHo0BTCQ,"This is my go to place for pupusas in vegas and my family from out of state always want to come here when they are in town. The flavor is good and consistent and they are always cooked just right. The drawback is the actual dining room tables and chairs, there not too comfortable and don't fit/go along with the tables so its awkward seating if you have four people at a table. The service here is a bit slow and also inconsistent at times but the food is definitely great.",c5tvQ7RYTYd8BQ1VMqVqNw,0,0,4,Uc1NFz6DTbZ9GNMENNPIBg

Friends had pork and cheese & bean and cheese. They have the dozen special everyday.... I so did not need to know that!!! LOL",A56LwaBHeC61nwZQEP6dnA,1,1,5,t_yWbVzjj0heFWPU2u_E3g
3198713,2012-09-15,0,Rr0ZigFhRXjBrvaHo0BTCQ,"Their horchata is so good. Their bean dip and their chips are a great starter. Their pupusas are very flavorful. My favorite is the chicharron, or pork skin. They have two tip jars. One is for the mesera, or the waitress. One is for the cocinera, or the female cook. 

If you order their regular pupusas to go, you can get 6 pupusas for 99 cents each. Their specialty pupusas remain regular price. 

They make everything to order. It's delicious, flavorful, and simply good. I'm a fan.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,4,3,4,_jLZZeZ5BDe-9DuEilk5-Q

These were packaged with a bag each of curtido, a spicy cabbage slaw, and a watery tomato salsa that tasted like tomato juice.  We thoroughly enjoyed our first ever pupusas in the confines of our room.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,1,2,3,KdllpJ6D82AuAYL5WRnvNw

Salvadorian food can be found in many places but...THIS IS THE PLACE.",5BYUpjhr7zJWaCidC4c4IA,0,0,4,V6zecRjkc27RkSW8ZGk0Fw
5050415,2013-10-21,0,Rr0ZigFhRXjBrvaHo0BTCQ,"I really enjoyed their bean and dip snack because I love chips and beans :) and the beans were delicious. But although the restaurant had only two other customers they took a very long time to bring us out one plate my bf and I were going to share. 

Once we got it the food was alright at best. It was not bad but it didn't make me want to come back again. 

Mon-fri they have a to go special but you have to order 10. 10 pupusas for $.99 cents each. Otherwise they are like $1.60 each. 

Would I recommend this place? No. Not likely.",w6kgmxGdoUtQhNmxOVvPyw,2,0,2,uvRXrgMJgJJc6LcGDQvBVg
