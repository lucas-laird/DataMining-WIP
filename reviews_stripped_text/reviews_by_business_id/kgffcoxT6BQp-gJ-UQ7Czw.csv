Really?? This store is in the same parking lot as SMITHS Grocery and these lazy and UNEMPOWERED employees can't take a five'r over there and buy a few avocado's for peoples sandwiches???  Subway needs to look at their policies, training, and allow their people to be able to satisfy their customer's needs....Adios!!",ih7Dmu7wZpKVwlBRbakJOQ,1,0,1,c6iTbCMMYWnOd79ZiWwobg

You can watch the employees picking the gunk out from between the bins with their fingers, and then watch them make your sandwich while wearing the same gloves. Another customer said something about changing gloves, and he was ignored. I walked out, and will never go back.",zqL43wHcz133AVvEuba67w,3,0,1,fisvc16rY1Q5NTX_O_QQ2A

I've had 2 bad experiences here at this location. About a year ago I went in and they had no bread. They claimed that they ran out. How the F does subway run out of bread. It's literally their main item. My 2nd bad experience was 2 days ago. I got stale bread. Again, bread is their main item.  How can they serve stale bread? They really suck at their job!  I would avoid this location and go to any other location.",m3WBc9bGxn1q1ikAFq8PaA,1,0,1,5iDdZvpK4jOv2w5kZ15TUA

The employees were very friendly,chatty and I didn't have to repeat myself. They had all their products fully stocked and they actually had AVACADO!!!! 

I will now always come here!",uZ4z-4ftg7LbGR_blmZTow,0,0,5,GZcMwH14Ohc35oVNNQ5C6g

I've been here a few times this summer and I always feel like this place is lacking.  Lacking what you may ask?  Lacking the friendly greetings when you walk in. Lacking the attentiveness and quickness the employees come out from ""behind"" the kitchen.  The employees are of a different caliber than other locations.  They seem like apathetic teenagers that do the bare minimum to get your out of their hair.

The last time I came in on Saturday I ordered my usual:

Toasted Foot Long Oven Roasted Chicken on Flat Bread with, Provolone Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Pickles, Olives, Bell Pepper, Onion, Vinegar.  

I didn't get the toasted part because their toaster was broken!  They did microwave it but that kind of defeats the purpose of ""eat fresh.""  You would think a restaurant would have a backup toaster on hand as it's such a key tool in their process.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,0,2,EeOaHnkH6YFHqQbGqRPRXg

3711288,2011-05-29,0,kgffcoxT6BQp-gJ-UQ7Czw,Dirty place! They don't even wear gloves when making the food. Also one employee had a bad attitude when he forgot to toast my bread after asking me if I wanted it toasted. He was upset with me because he forgot which I didn't understand. When making the second sandwich he was throwing the food together resulting in a terrible sandwich. I will never go to this Subway again!,sZGLFIjpOfSgDnEx_Jkhpg,0,0,1,smEpEBV-MM6TmYhbBg09Fw
3829295,2010-11-29,3,kgffcoxT6BQp-gJ-UQ7Czw,"I'm a fan of Subway in general....but this place is a good one because it makes good sandwiches.  Unlike the other reviewer, I've never had any issues with this location's cleanliness.  I've eaten here at least 15 times over the past 3 years.  It's on my way home from the gym, so I stop in here for a meal often.

This last visit, I ordered a 12"" BMT on Italian Cheese Bread, Jalapeno Chips, and brought my own Bottle of Water (much cheaper this way).

The BMT was awesome.  I had it toasted and put Provolone, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Mustard, Mayo, Salt & Pepper, Oregano, Oil & Vinegar on the Sandwich.  Very tasty.....just how I like it.

Will I return?  Unless I move, I will be back soon!",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,6,4,4,fSLa07uKnLz_fCI62ZVfrg

poor thing was there by herself with about 8 people in line all with super complicated orders, making last minute changes and all with multiple sandwich orders. she killed it. stayed calm greeted every person who came through the door and gave overall great service.",pXKT_UKT2JCgTGuw0OBhbw,1,1,5,O1gCFShXe3lcMdJLwtzXVg
5180018,2016-12-26,0,kgffcoxT6BQp-gJ-UQ7Czw,Good luck trying to get the order right. The clerks are either high school kids that don't care or don't understand English. Twice I told them I didn't want the sandwich toasted and they kept toasting it anyway. They didn't listen to what I wanted on the sandwichs.  I finally left them abd walked out. Don't waste your time unless your getting the featured sandwich. It seems that all they wanf to make.,H7bJDtGzhdg1fsmBL4KZWg,0,0,2,oCUrLS4T-paZBr6WnrXg_A
