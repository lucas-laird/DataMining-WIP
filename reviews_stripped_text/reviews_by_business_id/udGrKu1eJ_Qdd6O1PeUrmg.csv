86307,2016-10-07,0,udGrKu1eJ_Qdd6O1PeUrmg,"I usually LOVE the pt's on Sahara, but we were on the other side of town and tried this location. 

There was a drunk couple at the bar arguing about being ""from"" Las Vegas. The bartender, named 'Tip' entertained this argument instead of trying to calm the couple down. He also used profanity loudly during the conversation. This made the atmosphere feel chaotic and slightly aggressive. 

We arrived for happy hour, ordered 1 beer, Tip charged us 6.50 for the beer. We asked about happy hour prices and why we were over charged and he seemed to get frustrated with us. But then realized he was, indeed, overcharging us and proceeded to put 2 bucks cash on the counter in an irritated manner, saying ""I will just GIVE you the 2 dollars so you can exist happily"" this was rude and unprofessional. 
We weren't being obnoxious customers. Especially not obnoxious compared to the drunk couple that Tip kept arguing with.

Lastly, Tip was talking to a guy next to us and said very clearly ""I can't wait until this game is over, I hate this crowd"" 
We were there to watch a game, so was he referring to us? Or all the yelling customers around the bar? 

Either way, as a bartender, his performance and attitude was negative and unpleasant. We will not be returning",DmS31Jk9fq7Msl5fNSLjkA,2,0,1,LorSWclTdSdRdfIq0xhMtA

Never heard of a pt cantina but I will definitely come back.,bWiBDkA_O9MA0NCgkGdJ7Q,0,0,5,3Va7f8UUIW1tzaUObMJlNQ

2518099,2018-05-23,1,udGrKu1eJ_Qdd6O1PeUrmg,"I have been to PLENTY of PT's around the city...some have pool tables, some have kitchens, others are just bars with your shitty Roberto's Tacos or other no-name Mexican spot attached to it. My favorites are the ones that have a kitchen so that I can get my buzz on, order food without having to go into another building, and keep drinking.

This place is not that. In fact, it's one of the PT's with a random Mexican food place attached to it. So why five stars? Well, three stars because a bar is a bar and any establishment that can supply me with alcohol is A-OK in my book. FOUR stars because when you walk into this place you can instantly feel the LOVE. I've walking into PLENTY of a places where the first thing you hear is ""where's your ID, kid?"" I mean, yes, I look 16 but can you say hi and possibly smile while you're at it? Alicia was SO quick to say hello...SO quick to make my sister and I feel welcomed. 

So, FIVE stars because Alicia was SO. DAMN. AMAZING that I didn't care that we had to get up and go into another building to order food...I didn't care that the TVs were a bit on the smaller side when watching the Knights game...I didn't care that I had to wait a bit for another round of drinks. And 100% certain, had anyone else been serving that night I probably would not go back to this bar. But now I certainly would and it's a place I can see myself becoming a regular at.

Also, when we were there, it was almost Alicia's birthday. So, happy belated....hope your vacation was awesome and I hope whoever served you drinks met your expectations CUZ GIRL YOU DESERVE IT.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,3,3,5,4LwTzkfsj9UgE769d_vj0g
2540454,2015-10-13,0,udGrKu1eJ_Qdd6O1PeUrmg,"Eh....went here for happy hour. A couple decent beers on tap, but nothing too special. The food was half priced but service was slow. Only two bartenders taking orders and the kitchen was kind of backed up. The food was decent, but again nothing spectacular. Not sure I'd go back.",2Xv3RPbhSpiI-LTQ8lmZfw,0,0,2,JjC-r4PGPRRT9aY26zxI2w
3415715,2016-10-06,1,udGrKu1eJ_Qdd6O1PeUrmg,"What a terrible PT's this is. From the moment I pulled into the parking lot, it was a bad experience. Upon walking in, I immediately felt unwelcome. The bartender, Tip, continuously argued with 2 customers. The customer kept nagging him childishly, but he continued to argue and insult her using profanity like a bully. He should have taken the high road by ending the conversation for the sake of customer service. When I ordered my drink, which was during happy hour so it is advertised as half price, the bartender over charged me. I asked him the drink price and he responded 6.50. I was skeptical that my beer was 13.00 before happy hour prices so I asked him if it was supposed to be $3.50 and not the $4.75 he charged me? He became upset after going through the math with me. He exclaimed loudly and in a very annoyed manner that I was right. He even took out two dollars from his pocket and put it on the bar aggressively saying I could have it. It was very rude and it seemed as though he was looking for a fight. I just wanted to watch the baseball game and drink for happy hour. He continued to argue with the woman and her husband and complained loudly throughout the hour that I was there that he disliked the crowd tonight and he couldn't wait till the game was over so that people would leave. If he hates his job so much that everything bothers him he should not be there. It was an extremely negative and aggressive environment.  I will not be returning.",FFm2upU5ZyTpF-l7rMiOmQ,1,0,1,achRYIhk_k8SbPuh0kxEBg
3467207,2013-02-15,0,udGrKu1eJ_Qdd6O1PeUrmg,"This PT's loses stars because they don't serve food but they gain it back in their attentive and friendly bartenders. I generally only come to this location to bet sports but if anything goes wrong with the machine the bartender is always quick to help and offers a hello or a welcome back every time I walk in the door. 

Unfortunately this location always smells like an ash tray regardless of the actual amount of smokers in the bar. Because of this I barely want to stay more than a few minutes before retreating to fresh air.",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,1,0,3,oeQhZhom98Crezyb1jx5YA

I went in at 1:30am on a Monday on my way home from a holiday party, completely sober. They were dead empty and I walked to the bar and sat down for a moment to read Vegas weekly before ordering. I was there for about 30 seconds glancing between the menu and the paper before I had my first encounter with the bar tender who, had zero etiquette. She treated me like I was drunk or retarded asking me ""um, can you focus up here for a second"" and demanded I order immediately or gamble immediately, if I was going to sit at her (empty) bar.. 

After a short conversation during which I maintained a winning attitude and let her know I was going to sit and look over the menu and settle in before ordering, she bluntly and forcefully gave me a third option, the door. I gladly thanked her and gratefully exited this God awful bar..

I represent a lot of money, big tips, referrals, and a long term customer for those who get it right and offer personal and prompt service. Unfortunately the whole of the PT's brand lost (at least) one customer tonight. If there were an option for zero stars, I would pick that one because I'll never be their customer.",GHqS7jLOhgluLpu_-4YLwA,1,0,1,ePPHZfat87P4cDH6HX6dSw
4558311,2013-07-15,0,udGrKu1eJ_Qdd6O1PeUrmg,"So I work down the street from here, and live like 5 minutes away, too. Thus I come here simply out of convenience, and not because this place is awesome. 

This PT's does not serve food like some of the other ones do. However, they're connected to a Don Tortaco (a Roberto's-type place) where you can order your food and they'll bring it to you inside the PTs. That's good in my book, because sometimes after a number of Corona's you need a taco or three. 

The service at this PT's is ok, though nothing to write home about. They're always prompt with my drinks, and I don't think I've ever had to wait more than a few minutes to get my drink order taken --- no complaints there at all. 

Ultimately, I come to this place when I need a drink after work. It's really convenient in that regard, and the service is ok, too. Do I recommend you come all the way out here to grab a beer? No, as there may be other equally cool PT's in your area to serve you.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,1,1,3,upWjKww_IJebDlcJFYMGAw

He was very attentive and did well making the drinks. The gambling was actually loose for a PT's. I was able to play for a while and win some money.
