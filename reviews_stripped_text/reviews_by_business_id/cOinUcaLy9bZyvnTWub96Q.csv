857260,2011-07-19,3,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"Random fact of the week: There is a Capriotti's in the Regional Justice Center. Yes, you will hear the phrase ""beer money!"" spoken in the same building where the Nevada Supreme Court makes decisions.  

Disclaimer: I am not a Capriotti's fan but I applaud Capriotti's on their business sense.  Desperately hungry people like me, trapped in the RJC for hours on end, will do crazy things to get fed.  My desperation led me to eat at this Capriotti's, a chain I truly despise.

Capriotti's, to me, is universally gross and this new location did not disappoint.    I ordered the Cole Turkey featuring dry, overcooked turkey, sweaty provolone cheese, dry coleslaw, and one slice of tomato.  Eating this sandwich was like chewing an entire bag of cotton.  That's the Capriotti's experience!  This place was packed though, so apparently it's popular.

Needless to say, once my biological need for food was met, I threw away the rest of my sandwich.  Sadly, I'll probably be back, whether I like it or not.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,0,2,2,V_32X3wjWtTRT9cJVfW0dw
1566079,2016-04-17,1,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"This location is ok.  It's a little slower than other Capriotti's locations, and it can get really busy depending on the time of day.  They also close early because they are located inside the regional justice center.  If you go in the early afternoon they may not have what you are looking for because they don't want to make a new ""batch"" just to throw it out when they close.  I love the Philly cheesesteak and chicken Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  Not a bad spot if you are stuck in the RJC, but if you have time there are other better options nearby.",AQmxwrypH3iOHj6Y1s2nPA,5,5,3,tija84VN26sY2ETd86-WNA
2206970,2012-02-08,1,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"I love Capriotti's, we order it at work for extended staff meetings because they deliver. 

However, this location delivers when it wants to. The reason for the inconsistency they claim is based on whether or not they are busy. I will never understand why you'd miss out on sales.

We were excited when this location opened, but we're missing our old location that was always able to deliver.",ST74s3O3TGREMDHQWMFNQg,1,0,2,sE5fMqC-xCwVUWW00h53cA

My sandwich took forever because the girl kept messing it up, I didn't get to finish eating because I was almost late after my lunch break. They apologized though and gave me free chips. The food tasted great! The restaurant has a lot of seating! My experience was average.",7YkAI5_NfbcwhQeKMSZRwg,0,0,3,MsvHjAfJ1Zi-ysr4hKzXCA
3002862,2017-04-07,0,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"I'm convinced this is the best sandwich. It really is Thanksgiving on a bun.  Anytime I'm visiting Las Vegas I have to indulge and get a Bobbie. A small is plenty for one person, but you might as well go big. I always get the large and save half for a snack. I believe a large is 20 inches and a small is 9 inches. Don't forget to download their app and get $2 off your first order. Each time you visit you get credit when scanning the coupon after you pay. Not sure if it was just the specific location I was at, but if I remember correctly they used to just scan your purchase and you'd get credit. Anyways basically after 10 subs you get one  free! If you're in a rush you can also order online. Tip: This location is pretty busy during lunch so I'd just download the app and place an online order. Parking can also be a challenge, bring quarters to feed the meters.
So if you're into house shredded turkey, stuffing,cranberry sauce, rolls, and mayonnaise try the Bobbie. You won't be disappointed. Don't forget to get a bag of chips to complete your monster sandwich.",mKl0XBCWrNQEMgaHHmcNPg,2,1,5,h-R_vr6eFrNHKUpjlxoo_w

The workers are top notch.  They do their best to tailor the menu to your needs.  I like the salads best.  It gets busy during lunch, and they close at 3pm.",NrpzAH3EoNhWUR8OysUhBQ,4,3,4,h3cQfpHxigTh8_NHVwv3KQ

4323712,2017-03-23,0,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"Love Capriotti's! We've had sanwiches in Laughlin, Los Angeles, and now here. Three stars because my husband was happy with his sandwich and the employees were delightful...  This location is inside the courthouse so be prepared for the metal detectors. With that being said I was impressed with their quickness and efficiency. Unfortunately I am very disappointed in my order today. We ordered a large Capristrami which my husband loved but my Bobbie was horrible! The whole sandwich (large) was filled with bones, some small that I can understand a slight overlook but others were so big there was no excuse to miss them! We planned to snack on these today and tomorrow and now I have to throw mine away for fear of someone choking on the bones! Very sad",-58xgulrXMhEHcUrKvlIuQ,0,0,3,8wxQ8W2wGq5gvjT8oU7u4A

4628615,2016-09-17,0,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"I love me some Capriotti's, but didn't realize that this location was actually inside the courthouse until we got there. Oh well, pot committed, we went in. Shoes off, through the metal detector all for the Bobbie.

Look, Capriotti's is a local chain, so most of the sandwiches are gonna be the same from one location to the next. On the whole, I would give the entire franchise a 4 star, but this location gets knocked down to 3, just because of the spot inside. I still liked my sandwich, and I still will go to other Capriotti's locations, but I'm not seeking this one out again. It lacks the vibe I'm after for a sandwich shop.",eurIEcpGa_tTi1LMWa1pUA,1,0,3,a7qc0nW09zvxcfrOY-zY-w
4933082,2014-12-10,1,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"I had been hearing about capriotti's for a while now but my first time was when I had jury duty on the 8th of December.  I will never buy from them again.  The sandwich was very greasy and all I tasted was greasy onions and mushrooms mixed with cheese.  The meat had no flavor at all it was a disgusting sandwich.  Please don't waste your money.  They had the nerve to have tip jars on the counters.  It was a total waste of my money $9.18, I only eat half a sandwich because I was hungry.  Ugh!",q0N61z8h2dj3NxdU2_uwWA,0,0,1,9w_thwPUpsXTnVUWaPO0gA
5401617,2017-02-22,0,cOinUcaLy9bZyvnTWub96Q,"Capriotti's is Capriotti's. The location is INSIDE the courthouse. So if you get summoned for jury duty, this is the closest thing to food you have aside from the vending machines on every floor. 

Service could be better but I understand the stress with the line of potential jurors going out the door. 

I got my usual Cheese steak with onions, mushrooms, and hot peppers. Yum! 

Again, Capriotti's is Capriotti's so there's not disappointment there!",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,0,0,3,69yAnYINd5maWC1rKDk85g
