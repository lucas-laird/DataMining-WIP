This location at 840 Rancho has been solid in the past.  It's as solid as lunch locations go.  Because of the previous experiences, I am averaging a four with a two and coming up with a three star experience.

The service was as it normally is....friendly and efficient.  On my most recent visit, what I had normally come to expect at any Port location, is fresh product.  Everything with the exception of the lettuce was just fine.  Much the way some fear spiders or open spaces, I fear vegetables which are not picture perfect.  Had the lettuce been a half a shade browner I would have requested my money back. Hunger made the presentation acceptable, but next time....I will just walk out.

Arrive early dining in, lunch can make finding a table difficult.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,4,3,JfVml2ixr8-nWpwGVf006A
1906650,2013-11-17,0,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,Food is great but this location is almost always understaffed and wait times of more than 5-10min are not uncommon and much longer during busy weekday lunches. Staff is not particularly friendly or welcoming due to their work load.,7EO9chGODkEHpvXs1hClGA,0,0,3,Y4XA5L3UblWeM0MaKYWZOQ

I wait about 10-15 min before I could place my order! Didn't help that the guy in front of me ordered like 5 sandwiches at once! I ended up not having much time to eat and was almost late to work...only come here if you're not in a hurry and can take all the time in the world",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,3,PWN4AMHsu2D8a9_cvCLzrA

2600416,2012-08-10,0,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,"Found this place on my Yelp mobile app!

Came in for lunch on a weekday after hitting up the outlet mall. We were about to head home from Vegas. The shopping center was busy but we were lucky and found parking right away. We seemed to hit the end of a lunch rush because a) it was about 12:45 and b) there was a line, but you can see it was moving quickly. Let me just say that the folks who worked at this store were hustling! They worked well as a team, each doing their job and getting the customers helped and out the door. No wonder so many people came in for lunch. I ordered the Turkey Avocado Bacon sandwich and the hubs got a Tuna sandwich. We both got chips and drink. The ice in the soda machine was out and within seconds one of the female employees was coming out of the back with a big bucket of ice to fill it up! I think they were having ice issues though, another employee came in with bags of ice from the store so perhaps this is something that doesn't occur often. Once most of the customers left after being helped, the employees who weren't directly with a customer were cleaning and stocking the store. It was great to see such strong work ethic in a sandwich shop. The food was great too! We both thought our sandwiches tasted great and we ate them up! 

I am only bummed that there isn't a Port Of Subs close to my home. Vegas is too far for me to drive for a sandwich.

Overall: Great food & great service!",0ICKAGPEn36up1REsIm5sA,0,1,5,2PrxDlTSP6JLe7XTuQoS4A

One employee in particular, I think her name was Skylar, was very friendly and polite. She said it was her first day, but she seemed to be doing a great job! Keep up the good work! I'll be back for the pastrami!!",AAHG-yW_OCrEv8JPAxqhFA,0,0,5,PIOizBwk_gysOseb-XY3Ag

3901416,2013-04-17,0,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,"This review would have warranted a fourth star, but before writing it I ordered a delivery and it was CRAZY late... so I'm sure there's some work that needs to be done there. I called for my order at 10:30 to be delivered at 12. They said this should be no problem, but then arrived at 12:30, which is when my lunch is over, leaving me lunch-less for the day. :/

On the other hand, the in-store dining experience is fantastic. The food is fresh, and the menu displays options you probably wouldn't have come up with on your own. I like that they can make a KILLER BLT, and even microwave the bacon extra-long when I ask for it crispy. :) The staff were fantastically happy and helpful and made the experience a lot of fun. 

We'll definitely eat here again, but I'm hesitant to order a delivery.",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,0,0,3,sSB0Kh7ftkbk028ZuqDXDw

4265525,2016-03-15,2,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,"I'm not seeing too much of a difference between Subway and Port of Subs. I want to say that my cold cut combo that had some great meats in it did in fact taste better than Subway's version, but I'm not sure why. Maybe it's cuz they overloaded my sandwich with more mayo than I wanted, and that was actually a good thing. 

The one difference might be that they offer sourdough bread here as an option. I don't recall Subway having that. 

Fast service, and decent deals for large sandwiches. Worth trying if you're in the mood for a sub sandwich.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,1,3,5z_sx1zmEwE5LBH4DUkaFA
4451471,2015-09-08,2,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,"This Port of Subs is super close to my work and has become a go-to for a quick meal for myself and my co-workers. Usually we take turns running out to get orders for each other around 11:30 AM.

Being that this place is in a very busy location next to quite a few business park ares the staff is super efficient. While sometimes brusque, it's OK because there's usually a line all the way out to almost the doorway on weekdays during lunch.

I like Port of Subs for the freshly cut cheeses and meats. I also think their bread always seems fresher than Subways.

Honestly, for a quick lunch bite that everyone can agree on among my work circle Port of Subs is the place.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,3,5,2JrZk9pkqDTwkvonq-kc3A
4543440,2014-02-25,1,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,"The sandwiches are good, inexpensive and the workers are friendly and quick. The bread and meat is so much better than Subway. There isn't an array of toppings like bell pepper and spinach though, but they do have a variety of melts and hot sandwiches that look enticing. 

The setting is cramp and needs a minor soap and scrub. There's no bathroom to wash your hands and sometimes the tea and ice machine doesn't work. But all the workers, during my usual lunch hour (11:30-12:30), are personable and super friendly. And it's nice to see a good camaraderie between them. They also play 107.5 instead of that shitty, family friendly, soft rock. So thumbs up from me.",Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg,0,0,4,ldrs2Ms3_DcQG-cp4ImthQ
4623662,2012-11-17,0,7yntwIUh2ZEkWGe9Zth7tw,"I had a Groupon for this place, and I guess I'm the last Las Vegan on earth to try the food here. I was working right next door, and I noticed that they had a steady flow of customers. Since I had never been here before, I took a little bit of time to make my menu selection. Tis' the season for turkey and stuffing, and this place had a seasonal sandwich to commemorate the venerable Thanksgiving meal. My sandwich ""artist""  (Tom or Dan?) and the other employees really didn't seem all that enthused about their job. Thank goodness the lady behind me in line was my sandwich advocate, and she instructed him on how to make the sandwich correctly because he wasn't well-versed in the ingredients for each sandwich.

The turkey was processed lunch meat, and the amount of stuffing was pretty pathetic, so I requested a bit more. They were happy to oblige, but they placed it in the microwave to warm it up, and the stuffing ended up tasting like rubber. Seriously, I cringed a bit at the frequent use of the microwave. Ick!  I also purchased a chicken Caesar wrap, which did a fine job at underwhelming my palate as wel (thank goodness the lady behind me reminded Tom/Dan to put the romaine  lettuce and not the shredded iceberg he was planning on putting on my Caesar).

Their fresh veggies were quite limited, and to be honest with you, quite sad. I love a ""sala-wich,"" and I always ask Subway to ""run it through the garden when it comes to the veggies. Okay, so this isn't Subway, but it's a'ight. I'm not sure that I will come back though, because their prices are a lot higher than the $5 footlongs I've come to adore from their competitor, and the quality of the ingredients is lacking. Also, Capriotti's makes a better turkey and stuffing sandwich (the Bobbie), and theirs is year-round.

The staff was pleasant enough, and they were all quite prompt, but all 5 star ratings seem a little baffling to me. Meh!",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,0,0,3,Q2S6pNNC5MMfzMqdZYoPbA

I understand that some people have bad days. However, I felt very unwelcomed when I came in tonight with my fiancé to buy subs. The lady working seemed miserable, and just wanted us to leave. After we got our subs, we decided to eat there without realizing that it was almost closing time. After we sat down and started eating she walked over to the door and said ""We're closed, get out"".
