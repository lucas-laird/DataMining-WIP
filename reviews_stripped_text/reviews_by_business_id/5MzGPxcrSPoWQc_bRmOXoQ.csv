The Caesar salad comes with fresh garlic bread and is big enough to share. Other than that it's hard to pin down the menu as they have multiple specials everyday. The latest was shrimp and fish with fries and hushpuppies for about $11. It was excellent and again plenty of food for 2 people. 

The staff are great and very attentive to their customers.",MnDpS5jNtwi_HTSY2fMbPg,1,1,5,09fiyzI_G5XHMwVE1lWdFQ
1345479,2016-03-04,0,5MzGPxcrSPoWQc_bRmOXoQ,If you want to eat a mushroom salad with chicken that has zero flavor this is the place to go! As for me I'd like some actual lettuce and some chicken with flavor on my salad after all isn't that what I was paying for? It was a pathetic attempt for on over- priced salad. Will not try their food again!,LFHNbRdOJL2LDZUzyHz7Vw,1,0,1,TM3fsgM4cxY23F4vyRh7ZQ

Management allows other patrons to scream, yell and cuss at the television as well as other patrons, all while banging on tables and the bar.",1Z-uHCBZiH1Xshqgqyx3_Q,1,0,1,CLZ7rFhy9GO2hA6bdI_jPw
1825069,2012-09-24,1,5MzGPxcrSPoWQc_bRmOXoQ,"Virtually the same as any other pub/ bar around town. TVs, full kitchen, selection of drinks, games, and etc. Nice service too but my lone problem is the overcharge. 

I was billed $18.20 but charged over $21. Sure it's only 3  bucks but I mean come on, fix the register. I really have problems with businesses that do overcharges and they may not mean to do it purposely but if it's a constant issue, they should attend to it. Especially if they don't really pay attention to the details of their finances, they'd overlook the charge and not even notice it. Why should I have to go through calling my bank and filing a claim of an overcharge? 

If you plan on coming here, come with cash. That is all.",jCUqHcg4xvFtsG6ah6RcRA,0,0,2,Dgfm7c2DkXhSoUOwgQpnFQ

The thing we happen to like is they have this sunken area in the back with a couple tables and 4 plasmas that nobody sits at. We hang there and smoke cigars and the waitresses are just friendly and cute enough to make it ok. Don't hurt yourself getting here but if you come, grab a cigar and sit a spell.",nwvnNIixvyYTg4JS8g3Xgg,0,1,3,sCSFhTqE74s2O4SP1fCQYg
3391844,2013-06-17,5,5MzGPxcrSPoWQc_bRmOXoQ,"This is one of my favorite bars. Great bartenders and the food is pretty good. 
Personally, I love the burgers, Swiss cheese on sourdough with taster tots. It's the best. They also make a great grilled cheese sandwich. 
Thursday special is Beef Stroganoff and it's amazing. I crave it! 
Friday special is Prime Rib, it's pretty good, but the veggies are usually overcooked.
Chris on swing, and Hot Ritchie on grave are my favorite bartenders.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,5,7,5,9hdWm38IO8HULMq-w3eEqQ
4265280,2016-04-06,1,5MzGPxcrSPoWQc_bRmOXoQ,"One of my somewhat regular stops. Bartenders always friendly and quick with the cold beers and stiff drinks. Poker machines haven't been kind to me. But when are they ever?

It is one of those places where you order food and drink from different people and get different tabs. That confuses me because I am not that bright. Food is always fine, if not exceptional. But great stop for drinks, pool, darts and reflection on life's great dilemmas.",4tM75oNg3JJuRP0n73b4Tw,0,0,3,2N_rEhOVe9hQtxlO5KtVbg

5914959,2018-07-01,0,5MzGPxcrSPoWQc_bRmOXoQ,"Great place for locals! The service is impeccable compared to any bars around my location. Very dark and smoky, but if you smoke and like to play the machines a bit there is no better place. Tired of going to other bars and being treated like another customer from a disgruntled employee. The bartenders here are on point and do not disappoint. They treat us with the most respect and have an excellent service attitude. 

The crowd is definitely locals and the bartenders know them by name. You can come here and not worry about being harassed by someone hitting on you or bothering you. We are surrounded by popular bars and restaurants, but they all suck compared to this place believe it or not.",BIcS-utP2VUD2BFdTCPe8Q,0,0,5,9-CmTpw0K5FOWp4fhYDRoA
