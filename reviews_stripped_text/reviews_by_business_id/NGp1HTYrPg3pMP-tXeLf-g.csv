257812,2011-10-15,0,NGp1HTYrPg3pMP-tXeLf-g,Not the first fat burger that I have had and will not be the last. Good burger better fries. One thing I will say there was only two girls working and they were a little busey and those two did a good job getting food out.,i86XXjLN3e0sOl6MD_qzDw,0,0,3,YXvvuy-8E_E7GEwDmVt4Ww

I guess the other person was on break? Fat Burger is just as good in AZ and Cali as it is in Nevada. I order the veggie burger meal, my daughter a medium burger meal and my boyfriend the large burger meal. It came out to $31, and it was worth every bite. To save money next time we'll share soda's and save about $2 per drink since it's bottomless. :). Also if you wanted to save on time, call in the order. Remember Hidden Valley Ranch packet isn't free BUT sometime if you wait till the end and smile while asking nicely, you just might get it for free. :)",QiyvjCMCGhqscz26JcfEkw,0,0,4,5B506Zlq0VDZbaBl1LLncg

I asked the countergirl if they had it, because I didn't see it on the menu, and she said yes but only in a medium size. So I ordered it, with all the fixins. What I got was a cheeseburger patty plopped atop a mishmash of lettuce, relish, and a tomato slice.

If you're a low-carb diner, don't eat here unless you want to pay $8 for a sorry cheeseburger salad.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,1,amqSURNYNS9HkE8AdDPklA

The guys who was on the night shift around 6/26 1030p was amazing. The cashier who took my order was super friendly. And the cook made my burger perfect. We stepped away to gamble and the cook brought it right to our table. And I ate every bite. I watched them as I ate and their service was superb. I'll definitely be back to this location.

I've recently re-discovered how good this burger can be. My relatives go to this Texas Station Casino now and then and try to beat the gambling odds and Gods. But after gambling if they have money left, they get something to eat and replenish all those calories expended cussing out the machines.  On this trip, they bought me a large Fatburger.  Yum, I hadn't had a fat juicy, delicious, warm Fatburger in awhile.  What a treat.

There was a little more mayo than I like, and the lettuce and tomato along with the onions and relish made for messy eating.  But the best part was the seared, fresh juicy hamburger patty. The bun was fresh and didn't fall apart. Overall this burger can hold its own against any burger joint in this town.",eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,2,3,4,8mICmUNNLBlYhqwuAmB6PQ

We asked for acredit back to our card and these two kids said they didn't know how to do a credit?seriously they are frying burgers and ringing up orders but they want us to believe they don't know how!  I've worked in places with registers and you are trained how to handle these matters. The little girl was smug and disrespectful grinning saying you'll  have to come back tomorrow when the manager is here. I said I work tomorrow but again she just grinned and said sorry you'll have to come back tomorrow cause we don't know how to do our job!  they can't do Credit!  I wonder if I starting eating and the burger was awful she is going to say I can't do acredit so you will have to come back..not hardly! So I come back ""tomorrow"" and this little burger flipper says I told you to call first the manager is only here at 7...we can't help you and she called me a liar.  She is the liar because my husband was with me when she said to come back tomorrow.  I waited about h15 mins because they were so busy ..watching here maul the burgers and picking at the meat in the center to see if it was done...so I have been defrauded so I will contact my bank.  She smugly said we are a franchise...but franchisees cannot defraud their customers.  Beware if this place.  I hope you are truly not so stupid you can operate your cash register. She has a long way to go to learn how to treat customers.  Long story shorter...we kept coming back and kept getting lied to...finally Saturday we came back to get the food we already paid for and they refused to fix it until they talked to mgr who is never there...we refused to leave and after much arguing they agreed to fix the food we paid for on Wednesday...then the burger flipper Emily told security she was afraid of me cause I told her to go to hell which I absolutely did after her telling me I was a liar...she is the liar, my husband was present when she told us to come back on Thursday...we were customers if this place...she has no people skills at all so she should just keep flipping burgers and stay away with any interaction with customers.  We are guest here for a week and I will take the security guards suggestion and speak to the casino management about this restaurant employees.",8NRsTNzlkwWQ_xdeeRyS4Q,0,0,1,RkI4NE-2I1uGe0ldaGH6lA

Ordered a LARGE fatburger - the cook ANGEL proceeds to plunk the think ball of meat on the grill and wander off for 2 minutes!

Then flips it and still leaves in without flattening it to cook properly

THEN FLATTENS IT LIKE A DAMN PANCAKE so it 8"" wide !

So I'm watching him and knowing when he attempts to flip again - it will disintegrate - which is DOES...so this idiot proceeds to take the THIRD of the burger I just paid for and throw it down the waste hole on the grill!!  All while I'm watching this!  So I says "" Hey - you just threw away a 1/3 of my burger - I watched you! and he just looks at me spaced out like  - I tell the kid on cash who is like - ""I don't know!""  

How many times are they doing this to customers who are not watching??  I paid for a large and got less than a med burger - all because the grill guy is not paying ATTN and flattens the burger TOO DAMN MUCH!! 

I am relating this to head office and district supervisor as no one at THIS location gives a damn obviously - look at the pathetic score on this store and non reply for MGMT.....of course...IF there is any at all....",obl2AMeDcdedtjnRigXFKA,0,0,1,NC9tbUv2cCcHYe_VJIDIYQ

February 2, 2011

Intended on playing Bingo.  I arrived late and ended up eating Fatburger and gambling.  

Ordered:
Skinny Fries (Well-Done)
Fat Burger (no onions and relish)

PROS:
* convenient location located inside casino near movie theaters
* clean eating area
* they got my order right!  
* Unsweetened Green Tea and Black Tea!
*Chili fries and you can add an egg to your burger!

CONS:
* Wouldn't accept my BOGO coupon. Cashier didn't know how to enter it.

TIPS:
* Skinny fries taste incredible Well Done and extra Crispy !

This place would have gotten a 4 star if my coupon was accepted.  The only reason he didn't accept it was because he didn't know how to enter into the system.  I figured call a manager and off I go, but I guess that didn't cross his mind.  It's all good.  I still have the coupon and will use it next time I go to a Fatburger.  This is your typical Fast Food burger joint.  Just a bit more pricey.  Super Good though. I recommend you try Fatburger if you haven't already done so.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,3,2,3,5b1NrkA7hCV7Ys1rxT1eyw

Bowling with friends and drinking like a sailor led me to do it! It had to be close to midnight and I was shocked to see the sign still lit at the end of the dark food court. We sat at the bar and read the menu to the best of our abilities! 

Deceived by my beer goggles I felt the xxl would provide me just enough beef to feel like it wasn't quite a fast food burger.. to the burger I added bacon, cheese, and yess an egg! I also opted for a side of chili cheese fat fries and a Maui banana shake! 

To the facts. The burger was divine, well seasoned, and cooked fresh before our eyes! Oh yea that mofo was Humongous! The fries were huge and loaded with so much cheese and chili, they even provided me with Tabasco sauce to top them! Last and least favorite was the Maui banana shake. It was cool but I wanted more real bananas and I think I seen him use a concentrate which was not bueno!",u6OIc9ndbqrd6fO_jU2xcw,2,5,4,wo_n1cy6Qb2pfRWcLq930Q

The fries are not even worth mentioning I could bake fries in the oven better than their fries. Our burgers came out completely wrong. To the point where I had to physically write out my order so they could try to get it correct. And they failed a second time in getting my order correct.

We were walking down the main strip of Las Vegas Blvd. My friend Steve wanted to eat at Denny's, I said Hell no. Let go somewhere it's happening. Well we came up to Fat Burgers, right off the main drag. It was not to busy. I was not to hungry, but I ordered anyway. 

Here what I ordered, a large chocolate shake with whip cream on top, which it was really good. My sister ordered to Fry's, which it tasted like Burger King Fry's. It was not to bad. She also ordered the strawberry shake. She liked it. I drank the rest of it. My friend Steve ordered the chili, he said it was ok. 

Now to the service. We were #62, 63,64,65,66 and 67 were all waited on before we got our food. I sat and watch and stared at this guy making our shake. He took his sweet Ass time. I never in my life seen a human being take so long to make 2 simple shakes. Our waiter was horrid. I think litteredly  think he was stone. I had to ask him where is our food? He said""ah i don't know"". We finally got our food 45 minutes later. Remember this is a popular burger joint, the burgers and food are prepped. They suppose to cook the burgers quickly. 

BAD BAD BAD SERVICE for a renowned burger joint, we should have gone to DENNY's, at least we would have got better service. Hope to God the CEO of FAT BURGERS reads this YELP!",wgs7933m0faflIC4VWOJkA,1,0,1,mkomGh2iQbJbNB-plG_Dzw

He came back to the table and we chit chatted for a bit and I looked at the receipt and it said a cheese burger with everything but mustard. I told my friend and he went back up to catch them before they made the burger and right away before he opened his mouth she said ""We are already cooking the burgers so you can't change your order"", he said ok I was just wanting to tell you that the burger is suppose to be a cheeseburger with mustard only and it's wrong on the ticket. This server had the nerve to tell him that he was lying and didn't tell her that. 

Wow I couldn't believe it when he told me. If it were me she wouldn't have said it again that is for sure. What in the world has happened to customer care and satisfaction? It was such a simple thing that all she had to say was I'm sorry for the mix up and it will be no problem. I really don't think she should be waiting on customers.

Its been a couple days since we went there and I am STILL pissed.  

Food is great, a carb overload but very satisfying! 

Customer service... cashier... manager...  THEY DONT GAVE A DAM what you want... only what they can up sale you!  I went here and ordered a large combo with fries and a coke... for about 12 bucks... What I ended up paying was almost 18 bucks.

No I didn't notice how much until after I sat down and actually looked at my receipt ... yes dumb on my part but I was a little distracted with my drinking...  Any who I go up to the cashier and tell him that what I was charged was NOT what I ordered... This was before meal was prepared so I was sure it wouldn't be hard to correct... the cashier looked me right in the face and said I know that is not what you ordered but its better!

So the cashier  calls the manager over and HE tells me that he would not give me a refund that I was be happy with what I ordered. I argued that I didn't want double patty, too much food, just give me my money back ill go else where and he would not budge. He kept saying the burgers are so good that I would be grateful with the extra large meal, shake  ( it was good but I didn't need to mix shake with BEER gross plus I didn't order it). Needless to say I didn't want to start a scene since the MANAGER was the one telling the cashiers to pretty much rob us blind and I was drinking.. 

I just wanted to throw my pennies at that man and tell him he needed change more then I did... NEVER GOING BACK...
