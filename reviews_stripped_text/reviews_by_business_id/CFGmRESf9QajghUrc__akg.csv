As it happens, we found a new place and I gradually stopped going as frequently. With fond memories of this restaurant, I went there the other day and I am said to say that it is just a shell of its former self. Portions were smaller overall and the amount of chicken they gave me in my teriyaki bowl was miniscule. My overall experience of eating here was not even close to what I recall. 

I asked and was told that a new owner was running the place, so that explains it. Its too bad, because like I said, it was a great little spot before. Revert to the old ways, and I will once again be a regular.",wnFZvMfADzG6l5YI6G56bg,0,0,2,sHLBPJyhCToBs5LwIm5j7g

It wasn't busy that night, but they saw me park my car as they were cleaning up to pass the time and all the employees pretty much got up into position and waited for me as I was walking in. Kind of awkward, kind of nice to be appreciated. They all intently waited for me to make up my mind.

I ordered the STEAK RICE BOWL with brown rice and veggies. By the time I was done paying for the order, they were practically almost done with my food. I was thanked for coming and it did feel genuine. I was pleasantly surprised that the services was so good.

Now the fact that the food was cooked so quickly, I was hesitant, but the taste test proved otherwise as my food was delicious.

I am here on vacation and like many people, I wanted to stay active and eat right.  I wasn't sure if I would have been able to do that, especially here in Vegas but this place definitely did that for me! 

I was greeted when I walked into the store with lots of energy and happy spirits. 

I couldn't decide if I wanted rice or noodles and they were so kind to let me have both! The brown rice was delicious, so fluffy, and moist! (I usually get dried brown rice from other places so I was super happy that it was made right!  ) And the noodles were excellent especially with their teriyaki sauce. I also usually go for sriracha but I tried their seven season spice and it was so perfect with the dish!! I wish I could take it home to season all my meals! 

They gave a great amount of steak / chicken which I was very pleased with! ( we need our proteins:)) and I received my food very fast. It's like fast healthy food. Who doesn't like getting their food faster than expected?? 

The vegetables were not seasoned but it went perfectly with the teriyaki sauce they spread over the bowl alongside that seven season spice! 

Their customer service was awesome. They checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying the meal, and were super friendly to everyone that came through the door as well as when they left. I can't express how much I believe customer service makes the experience all the better. 

I will definitely return every time I'm on vacation! Great customer service, and great healthy food choices.

I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to an unhelpful employee. She claimed that she did not see my specifications for each order (even though my order summary was very clear). After some convincing, she gave me the manager's number, who did not pick up right away. I had to call them through the customer service line using Eat24 app. When I eventually did get a hold of the manager, she said she was not informed by her employees of the situation. She was apologetic, but only refunded me two bowls and two drinks. I honestly think the inconvenience and the taste of the food was worth more than this, but at this point, I was just done.

I go the chicken and steak bowl and man oh man this thing is delicious. I like to chow down on the bowl like I haven't eaten since 1980! Get down on it! (1980) song I think lol!b

We were starving after bowling at red rock casino and wanted something fast, but not fast food. Found this place nearby. Never heard of samurai sams before, but im a fan now. We got a chicken terriyaki bowl combo with potstickers and a yakisoba with salmon. Quality was great. Portions were filling. Teriyaki sauce was bomb! And best of all, we didn't feel like crap after :D Now I wish we had a location back home :(",J10Y8TdOl3q_7BOKY28-LQ,0,0,5,ogvZ8E5EZiEDnAPSA2EpQw

We used to love this place and were excited that we just moved back to this side of town, so we were close again.  However, last night was terrible.  The rice was beyond crunchy and difficult to chew let alone swallow.  The vegetables were cold and lifeless, like frozen veggies you didn't microwave long enough, and the meat (chicken and steak), were rubbery and tasteless (we each dumped three things of sauce on our bowls to try to make it a little more flavorful, alas, it did not work).
Perhaps we'll give it another shot one day, but not any time soon.",ULl4bTfv-lf4bHZwhJovxg,0,0,1,qZgqr7BKePHyNzsBHOVnxw

It is good quick healthy food, depending on what you order. I did not expect it to be spectacular, so I don't understand the other reviews that complained about the beef. It is a fast food restaurant, they are not going to use USDA Prime beef. I usually get a Sumo Bowl with brown rice and white meat chicken. It is a pretty big portion.

I do agree with the reviews that said this place was better a few years ago. I started going here about six years ago, and you can tell the difference from then to now.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,1,1,4,8-lw5fHZOfsp9-iEIs_QEw

Most recent annoyances are that they charge you more than what is posted on their menu board, the music they play is probably too urban for an enjoyable dine in experience, and the food has gotten worse. Mushy rice, tree branch like cabbage and mushy chicken. The steak has gotten better, but it doesn't compensate.  Not sure the staff is properly instructed on customer service or maybe they just don't care.  Last time I asked to be refunded the difference they had an attitude. It was only $0.30, but it was the point of the matter.  May just have to go next door to China Tango instead.  Hope thy get better.
