We sat on the couches near the dart boards to watch the rugby match. First, the genius who put the dart boards near the TVs...NOT a genius. When people are playing darts they block the view of the TV's. I came to watch a rugby match & drink...this mission not accomplished. But not bc of this alone. 

Service is crap. Period. BOTH visits our server was rude. The first visit the server got a $20 tip on a $20 tab bc my date is a bartender & a generous guy...I wouldn't have left you a penny. Our second visit...Whoever the dark haired snot is that worked Saturday night around 10:30pm...I hope my date didn't tip you bc not only were you rude, you couldn't be bothered to do your job.  That I had to ask you for a menu, ask you if I could order food & ask you if you would take my drink order was disgusting. Forget we waited 20 minutes for you to appear just to ask you for a menu, but when you did appear you're condescending & asked ""What do you want?"" Sorry...you're there to do a job-serve-I certainly wasn't there to give you money without you having earned it.  

I'll go to Maryland Pkwy or St. Rose location. Not impressed by the lazy & rude staff at this place.  Food is ""okay.""  Definitely overpriced for what you get.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,5,2,1,PTPGGqdkclBEzMKPEU6llA

I was panicking at home at 9am Saturday morning when my internet crashed. I had a deadline, so I rushed to my favorite PTs in town for use of the Wi-Fi, even though Its much further than the four PT locations nearby home.

Much to my delight I got to meet Molly who got me a fresh cup of coffee and kept refilling it. Perhaps the best thing about her was the genuine smile that felt like it was saying ""I'm so glad you came by; thank you."" 

Molly apparently is just naturally friendly, but the stress of my situation quickly evaporated with that smile and good nature. I got the job done well. PTs should bottle up what Molly has and make it part of initial training for all to follow. She's almost Muse-like, inspiring.

The reason I come to this location even though it's so far from home is because of routinely getting great service. I visit once in a while during the day and there is another great bartender named Carrie who is always so kind.

So thanks Molly, and thanks to Carrie. You both got it down and I'll continue to visit no matter how far I live. Great service creates loyalty. The coffee was good as well, but that is so secondary in this situation.",6Ht-9PNjcIU4EnDLLhEHkw,0,0,5,5avRKGEJ0OmnTHjZxMZ7UQ

I arrived about 5:50 P.M. The parking lot was pretty empty which I found odd. 
I went inside and sat at the bar. Their was maybe 7-8 people inside total.

I asked the bar-tender if he had any blended fruity drinks...he said NO. No blended drinks period. I was like...Hmmm..OK...It was still close to 95* outside so that would have hit the spot.

I ended up ordering a Mai Tai. I asked him for a food menu and I ordered a 1/2 lb Pub Burger (comes with fries) for $7.00 which is a 24 hour special they offer. 
Food was pretty good..Can't complain.

Happy Hour is from 5-7 P.M. & 12-2 A.M.
50% off drinks & Pizzas and have a select few appetizers that are $5.00.

Now...on to the basketball game situation. All I can say is WOWWWWW.
They have huge screens in the pool table area (NONE of them had the basketball game on)
They had 1 tiny lil tv screen at the bar with the game on (NO SOUND) 
Every single screen had the Hockey Game sound on. SMH.
No One was even watching them either. 
I will never try and go here to watch a basketball game again. Still can't believe it.
Drinks are weak as hell and served in a tiny lil glass...I ordered 1 more after I was done with my food...Then I left.
Bartender wasn't personable at all...and he had a dirty nasty band-aid on his fingertip area...That I couldn't help but notice as he grabbed fruit and limes etc. to make the drinks...Ewwww.

One would also expect a bar with a female manager and female waitresses to have a reasonably clean ladies' room, as they all use it too. But the ladies' room is always filthy. 

New manager chick also needs a class in customer service. Making sure everyone can see your little boobies might get you some mileage with the male customers, but I have my own boobs.

Happy hours is really good here they have a prices here for Happy hour.
If youre looking for a party I say this is more of a laid back bar, no rowdy guest, no loud drinkers, not even during games. Its a quite place to eat and drink. 
One thing I have to put them on the map for is there freakin amazingly delicious and creative ways to serve their fried. OMG they make fries a whole new category on its own at PTs... if you just need a quick snack try some fries. Dont get me wrong Ive tried other food, and its just as good, but those fries are addictive! 
The service isn't anything to shout to the world about, they kinda favor towards certain ppl or regulars or im not sure, but the tend to some a bit more then others... but they are quite attentive to the rest just some more then others... they dont smile much in here either....But I never get bad service in here! Just laid back more quiet service, not a bad thing! 

Id say if you haven't been go! Especially during happy hour!",hDeirf2kbzrMdjE2t1XwlA,0,1,4,KgnGzuZeGh03tmdkIHV9Xg
4271841,2014-04-08,1,WKrCvD-CoDZnCj3nsMCrRw,"Ok this is no longer my favorite PTs. I would come here after work to relax and enjoy a drink. I don't have that same enjoyment of this place anymore.

Rewind back a few months. My bf and I came here one night for a few drinks. I order a Bellini, which is champagne and peach purée. The bartender Carla didn't know what that was and made this face like I was making up some absurd drink. It's a typical champagne cocktail! And plus you're a bartender, you're supposed to know your drinks. She knew what a mimosa was when I ordered it, she should have known what a Bellini was. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, my bf accidentally knocked over my drink shattering the glass on the floor. We thoroughly apologized and I understand that Carla was annoyed she had to clean it. 

Now fast forward to our visit last night. We order a beer from this one blonde bartender. Really nice and inviting. We were enjoying our time. Then Carla comes over and says to my bf ""do you want another beer?"" Then he answered ""sure I'll take another one."" Then she replies with ""what is it?"" Um rude!!! My bf said she probably remembered us from the glass breaking incident, which is why she have us attitude. Anyway, after that I was just in a fowl mood and we left shortly after. 

Looks like I won't be going to this PTs anymore. There's another one down the street from us so it's not like I'm going out of my way.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,2,1,2,yYHLAx2UaK8SYB2i4DBAkw
4622610,2017-04-01,0,WKrCvD-CoDZnCj3nsMCrRw,"Pretty disappointed. We waited 20 minutes for drinks (we asked for 16oz happy hour and they gave us 25oz mugs) and over an hour for our food. Asked for no green chille on a sandwich that they ""cut in half"" and got them, grilled onions on a burger they came raw, the French fries were greasy limp and under cooked and the French dip was more ground beef then finely sliced. Our waitress never checked on us and when we got the bill they upcharged us for 25oz mugs that we didnt ask for! They even took 15 minutes to run our card because their system went down. They did seem really under staffed but to be honest the place was not busy. The manager comped some of our bill but we won't be back unfortunately.",-kLwexA3byS8IV_3Yw-b6Q,0,0,1,Nw_qsQiMK8xO257oyPWzmQ

I order their Cobb salad and a bucket of chicken wings - crispy & dry. I get three sauces on the side: Buffalo Medium, Sweet Chile & Asian BBQ. Of course I do blue cheese dressing instead or ranch :)

The combination of the super fresh salad and the wings is deliciously good. Give it a shot!",yHej125HqvQGHNvKnjiekg,2,1,4,WnyrYcBQUN3yFq8ajecHlg

I love that they have darts and pool tables for the pool sharks. The bar was very clean and although there weren't many people inside, it looked as if it were running smoothly, almost effortlessly. 

I ordered a Long Island iced tea, crown royal on the rocks and I had a gorilla salad (I made it vegan of course). The Long Island wasn't anything special I felt like $9 was a bit much for what I was presented but what I loved most about this PTs at this location was the customer service. 

There's a guy named Mike and I'm. It sure what the bartenders name was but she was very nice as well. I went in alone but they made me feel welcome and made sure my orders were done correctly and they even took a little off of my tab. 

Although the cigarette smoke was irritating and simply disgusting To have to smell while you're eating. Mike made up for it, with his exceptional customer service skills. I would definitely comeback maybe during happy hour to enjoy drinks and shoot some pool.

That made me feel at home and comfortable which goes a looooooon way with me.",GTFnwya4c77RFyHTQXhZFA,2,2,4,SYT2nH_79kOo4pcE243S6Q

Molly assisted me and was SO awesome. She took my order around 9am and scheduled it for me to pick up at 2pm. I showed up a little bit early and found her to be just as fantastic in person. She signed me up for a loyalty card and delayed my order so I could have a beer and throw some money in a machine. Once I was ready for my food, she let the kitchen know to prepare everything. The wings were tasty, as were the tots we ordered. The beer was cold, my machine was hot and overall it was a great experience.

But he's super awesome and took care of us last night. Every drink made was to the rim. He wasn't shy at all.  He's usually there Mon-Wed graves so you'll definitely see him during Happy Hour. 

I like this location. It's really big and has many tvs and three pool tables. Lots of room to roam around and even has a little lounge area with couches. 

I like to get happy hour because it's 50% off pizza, drinks, and select appetizers. You really can't beat that deal!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,3,1,4,hv0KFGunKgU_xFjxXMZUdg
