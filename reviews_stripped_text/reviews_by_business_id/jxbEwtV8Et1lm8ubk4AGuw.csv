The only issue was that there were no champagne for mimosas, due to these guys not having their liquor license yet. My wife asked could we bring our own liquor in, and the waitress said yes. So a 5 star went down to a 4, and quickly shot back up to a 5. Enjoy!!!",Ki7-Ey8ILl1nTzErg9nP8Q,0,1,5,Lr_bkD6R7mwwQL5_DRYP3g

The service was impeccable, warm, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Everyone was genuinely nice and put their heart into everything they served. And oh my God was the food good! It was unbelievable delicious! The portions are truly enormous (my fluffy, light, heavenly, homemade buttermilk pancakes were bigger than my head!) everything was fresh, homemade and delicious! The chef is definitely creating world class cuisine in this little spot-its like a secret that has yet to be discovered. The Mimosas were made with hand squeezed orange juice and were so light and refreshing.  And they have a wide range of menu options for breakfast and lunch, something sure to please everyone. Mimosas Gourmet offers high end food without break the bank prices. They definitely could be charging more -huge portions and the very best ingredients but the bill was extremely reasonable. When they found out it was my mother's birthday, they made her feel so special and the owner even came over to give her a gift certificate for a free future meal. I can't recommend this restaurant hard enough...I have lived and traveled around the world and know a good thing when I see it...Mimosas Gourmet is a hidden gem and you should definitely check them out before everyone discovers them and you can't get a seat!",_5mASu09ytZh4E9ZMpDY9A,10,0,5,wjiWiBBrsSBUjgq2y8gkNA

Upon our entrance to the restaurant there was no one to greet us at the door. After waiting nearly 5 minutes we sat ourselves at a booth next to the front door.

We waited another 10 minutes before we were finally greeted by a server who wiped down the table & brought menus.
She apologized for the wait, walked a way, and eventually returned to take our orders.

It took nearly 45 mins to receive our food! My order came out incorrect (short stack with a side of hash browns & bacon) so I told the waitress what I actually ordered. She walked away, only to return with the same plate less the eggs. I repeated, once again, what I ordered. She shook her head and proceeded to tell me what the waitress rang in. I let her know I didn't order that and would like the mistake corrected. She walked away & finally came back with the proper sides.

At that point I was no longer interested in the meal. I had a bite to eat off of my husbands plate & was finished with breakfast entirely. The food was pretty descent, but definitely not worth a nearly 2 hour wait start to finish.
Needless to say we won't be returning.",xxORYYCYzAKz1uVuePjgDA,2,1,1,zllH5vOVGn9XHVSZ6FzyFQ

MIMOSAS GOURMET.. so the thought of traditional French brunch thoughts were dancing in my head, opened the door and NOPE! It was basically a feel of American/French and heavy handed Mexican cafe but put on cool plates and presented a little nicer. The staff had that I just Rolled out of bed feel , made me feel comfort as we shared that much in common. Very friendly by the way. Allot of Spanish speaking across the room from kitchen to staff and Spanish commercials in between songs made me feel like I was back home in California.. love it!

DRINK: Coffee is served in a cute large mug. Cold drinks are served in mason jars. They are not serving their mimosas yet but based on the variety of mimosas on their menu, I know it's going to be great. Can't wait to try their lychee mimosa and their guava mimosa!

This restaurant was great bec they had plenty of breakfast options and lunch options! 

One funny drawback? Even though they are called Mimosas, they do not serve alcohol. No alcohol license yet. BUT, they do allow you to bring in alcohol from the grocery store next door, and create your own alcoholic drinks! 
The staff was incredible friendly and attentive!

We ordered the burger and huevos rancheros. The meat for the burger was not very good. Pretty dry, and just poor quality. However, the sweet potato fries that come with it were amazing!!! 
The huevos rancheros were good. Not amazing, but good. 

The decor inside is a bit odd. I think perhaps since they are still new, they are still transitioning into their decor. Seemed a bit unfinished inside.

I was greeted and sat wherever since I had the whole restaurant to myself, yus!

Their menu has quite the variety. From basic scramblers to eggs benedicts (my fave). I got the irish eggs benedict which consisted corned beef, hash brown, muffins, potaties and a whole lot of hollandaise. 

I wanted something small and didnt expect how big their portions are here. This thing was huge!! Bigger than my face, seriously. It was mouthwatering and it was indeed delicious. I loved it! I requested my hash browns to be extra crisp and they did that for me well.

The server was very friendly. I am sure when this place is busy they maintain a fun and upbeat attitude.

Colorful decor; sort of random but hey its homey. Mason jar water cups and looks like they have quite the bar for their mimosas which I didnt get to try buuuut I certainly will sometime.

It tastes even better than it looks, and I ate way more than my stomach could comfortably hold just because it was so tasty. The home style potatoes with peppers and onions went really well with this and the excess sauce on the plate. When I come back, it's going to be hard to take a chance ordering anything else!

The Chile Verde Omelet was a less successful dish for us, but I'm eyeing the Chicken Enchilada version for next time. Note that you can substitute pancakes for your side of toast for just a buck- and theirs are made with a sweet cream buttermilk and they're good even eaten plain.

If I had known how huge my quesadilla was going to be, I probably would have looked for something smaller, because it was so packed with eggs, cheese, sausage, and bacon in a tortilla sandwich that covered a huge plate, I could barely eat a quarter of it with some potatoes and a little side of chipotle type salsa. No problem. It was tasty and filling the following two days as well after having to take the leftovers home.

It's awesome outside they had a little coffee area that said enjoy complimentary coffee while you wait, that was a cute touch I have never seen before.

We were seated and drink order was taken right away. Then about 15 minutes later our food order was taken. There isn't anything for the kiddos to do while you wait so bring something to keep them entertained.  The food took awhile to cook but that's ok, however in a really busy day I can imagine it would be longer.

Food was amazing. Had the steak, avocado sandwich with caramelized onions and fries. Their fries are the best. 

Kids meal portions are huge. Daughter had pancakes , with the eggs and bacon. Their pancakes are the bomb.

Husband had skirt steak and eggs and potatoes. Skirt steak was over cooked and a bit rough, toast is also over cooked but potatoes were amazing.

Service and people are nice, birthdays here are nice. The mimosas are mediocre. But will definitely be coming here again.",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,1,0,4,J9WcxOh1ttKoJgoSoFHHiQ

After reading some of the reviews i became a little curious. A review 5 months ago states they didn't have a liquor license, another review from 2 months ago she reviewed how the mimosa wasnt that great and now they have no license again?! Makes me wonder why they keep losing it. Anyways. 

You seat yourself pretty much. They did greet us right away and take our order. Caution the water tastes just like water from a hose so order something else to drink. They do have lots of different juices and they did taste pretty fresh.

We ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and the strawberry waffle. The chocolate chip pancakes are HUGE! Two pancakes serves with strawberries, whipped cream and drizzled chocolate syrup. Definitely large enough to share.  The waffle was a typical size topped with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and served with a side of maple syrup and butter. The food was good. Unfortunately the fact that it took so long for it to come out was a bit of a turn off. 

Overall, not a bad experience but nothing out of the ordinary or something that stands out. Maybe if they ever get a liquor license and actually sell what their name says it might be different.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,13,13,3,C8Yg7f18pLRFeI6XFLgGwg

I have had far better mimosas in my day. However, that doesn't discount their ranking as a breakfast hot spot. Alcohol aside, I really liked many things while dining here. The atmosphere is good, there was no wait to be seated, the staff is friendly, and the food is decent. I personally wouldn't recommend the breakfast quesadilla - but I think that is because I have been highly spoiled in the Mexican breakfast delicacy department. My boyfriend's Southern Scramble was delicious but I think it should be under the benedict portion of the menu - if only because of the confusion of not getting toast. The part of the menu it is under now states that toast comes with the meal, sub pancakes for some change. However, when you tell them you want either toast or a pancake they will inform you that the item is in the wrong section and that because it comes with a biscuit it doesn't come with any of the sides the other items in the same section do. If I came back here I would try a benedict or a traditional breakfast - I get the feeling that's what they are really good at.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,5,3,3,S0XS2upL9d1UHeWyLW9_xQ

That being said, they do NOT have bottomless mimosa's, however, they do have about 10 different flavors. My wife loves mimosa's so we drove over a half hour to this place because... Mimosa's. It was worth every mile, as this was a gem. For food, she had the smoked salmon Benedict, and I had the Irish Benedict. Believe me when I tell you, the corned beef was NOT from a can. She said hers was incredible, but I didn't try it as I'm not a fan of salmon.  She tried two different types of mimosa's, the Peach, and prickly pear. She preferred the prickly pear (it was incredible) but seriously loved them both.

You can bring your own bottle of champagne,  and I did on my return visit. They looked genuinely excited that I brought my own and immediately grabbed an extra pitcher and filled it with ice and water to keep it cold. They charged the 2 of us for 1 juice even though we got 2 different flavors to make our mimosas with. 

As for the food, everything has been solid. 
-Nutella pancakes: There is an absurd about of Nutella on there to me a non-Nutella lover, but I can see how someone would love it. But my boyfriend said that he wished it didn't have marshmallows.  
-Corned beef hash: My favorite so far! I love the horseradish sauce on it and the insanely large biscuit. 
-Gorgonzola scramble: I love gorgonzola, so this was a no brainer selection, but it wasn't enough food to me.
-Bacon waffles: They actually crushed bacon and put in the batter. Bacon in every bite!
-Brunch burger: Pretty solid. Also very large. 
-Fried chicken benedict: Very large biscuit with above average gravy with rosemary. 

Most meals here can easily be split. And they serve breakfast til 4 on the weekends!

I was skeptical at first (I've tried my fair share of pancakes in town) but the moment I tasted a sweet bite of crispy, fluffy heaven I was sold! Perfectly crisp, extremely moist, fluffy and not swimming in butter; it's the perfect recipe! (besides our homemade pancakes) 

The short stack comes with 2 massive pancakes for only $7 (Rated: 5/5.) That's a great value and could probably feed 3 adults if y'all into sharing and that wild stuff. 

We also ordered the crab, prawn and avocado Benedict $14 (Rated: 4/5), which also comes with your choice of hash browns or potatoes. The portion is also larger than 2 adult appetites so we had a lot of leftovers (No one is complaining!) I loved the hollandaise sauce and the flavor of everything combined was great. The perfectly runny yolk and crisp edges of the english muffin were a tasty touch.

BYOB (BRING YOUR OWN BOOZE!) They have been open for 8 months now and still don't have their liquor license yet. I was looking forward to trying their advertised mimosas but was turned down.

We got 4 different entrees the corn beef hash. It was delicious but I wish they served it with something other than hash browns because there's already potatoes in the hash, but other wise delicious. The Nutella marshmallow French toast was to die for. Bring a tooth brush because this has enough sugar for the entire year. I recommend sharing this one. The steak skillet and the chorizo omelette were also full of flavor. 

The service, this is where they lost stars. Our waitress threatened us before we ordered so that was really a damper on our meal. We ordered four mimosas which is the name of the establishment. After 3 came out they told me they couldn't make the watermelon one because it would take too long. I was staring at the watermelon on the counter and just ordered a different one because from the beginning our waitress was rude. This mimosa never came and I decided not to bother. They obviously charged us for it but were really nice and apologized for it. I really wish I had a mimosa though. 

All in all an interesting experience, probably won't go back because I don't like to be served by rude people. But the food might tempt me to go back. I really want to try the churro waffle (this is a note to self)",YEUpvvy_aUUZTWMT2hYuYg,0,0,3,ASfVqzGm2RdemhQAeagUfg

The breakfast menu has a wide variety of choices. Our two selections were the short stack of pancakes (2 per order) with a side order of bacon and the Chili Verde with two eggs over easy and hash browns. The Chili Verde breakfast comes with three corn tortillas, refried beans, choice of eggs, choice of potatoes, and choice of toasted bread. The pancakes were very large and had a nice hint of vanilla. The bacon was over cooked, hard to cut and was returned to the kitchen. The pork in the Chili Verde was fork tender and tasty with the green salsa. The two eggs were perfectly cooked. I would have preferred a thicker sauce for the refried beans. Hash browns were nice and crispy but way too much for one person. I passed on the toast.

3394561,2017-06-12,4,jxbEwtV8Et1lm8ubk4AGuw,"The reason this place gets one star is because THEY DON'T HAVE MIMOSAS! Upon sitting down and looking at the menu they have taped a notice over the mimosa portion of their menu saying they don't have a permit to sell mimosas. I don't know how long they have been open, or if they once had them, but they lose all integrity if they don't have the item they are named for. 

The reason this place could get two stars is because their food is decent. I tried their biscuits and gravy. They weren't my favorite because they were spicy and had a southwest taste to them, rather than your traditional home-style biscuits and gravy. I did not like that, but I could see other people liking that. I also tried their eggs benedict and their country potatoes. The eggs benedict was unremarkable. Their country potatoes, like the biscuits and gravy, were a little spicy and more southwestern, made with bell peppers and onions. I'm not opposed to this, but it should have been described in the menu better, as that was not the style I expected. I also did not care much for their coffee. I will say that their pancakes were amazing! Even though they were huge, they didn't have the too much like cake feel, and had a perfect crisp to the outside and the perfect consistency on the inside. Maybe the food would have tasted better with a mimosa? I'll never know.  

The reason this place doesn't get anymore stars is because the ambiance wasn't amazing. The decor is sunflower yellow colored walls with mediocre paintings of flowers. The service was good and the servers were nice, but nothing that stands out.

The restaurant is packed in the back corner of a virtually dead shopping center, I was skeptical. 

I walk in and im immediately suspicious of: Purple and yellow decor and the lack of people inside. We sit and look at the menu which was pretty big, and I decide on the veggie skillet and proceeded to talk about how these breakfast places never have something for vegetarians, just vegetarian options. I was being petty.. . 

The food comes out. I knew at that point that I was so wrong. And should be ashamed of myself. Lol. The portion size was a bit above average which is code for perfect. I've been on the vegetarian spectrum for quite some time and I feel like this was one of the best representations of vegetarian food. (lacto-ovo specifically) the veggies tasted so good. The sauce to veggie ratio was good. Like it felt homemade. I just can't get over it. 

My girlfriend had the corned beef and she was gushing over her plate for a while as well. She was a fan of how well cooked the onions were. But the beef was the star for her. 

All in all. The prices were decent. The decor is just as goofy as all other breakfast diners and the food is the bomb. Will return many times. Hope they last in that terrible location.",6JuDcEt5YTxKp2qcYLEGog,6,1,5,-cwQ2AggmXfR46SmRhmp0A
4107163,2018-04-28,6,jxbEwtV8Et1lm8ubk4AGuw,"I really wanted to give a higher rating, but this place simply isn't named Pancakes Gourmet.

Mimosas Gourmet is a brunch restaurant that's located clear across town from me. Although I normally wouldn't have to venture beyond Henderson for this type of food, I was meeting up with some friends and they seem to favor this side of town in general.

This spot is next door to La Maison de Maggie, which I'd tried last year, so I knew where I was going. In case you're not as familiar with this plaza on Durango between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn, look for Dunkin Donuts and Arby's and take one of the small side streets, preferably on the Arby's side.

The place was completely packed when I arrived, and fortunately our group was already seated. It did take a while to get to order, but they seemed to prep the food quickly enough once that happened. I won't knock them for any slowness.

However, I didn't really like two of the dishes which I'd tried. The star protein of the Fried Chicken Benedict ($13.50) was boring and dry, not the juicy meat with crispy batter which you'd expect. To add insult to injury, the biscuits (a twist, replacing the standard English muffin) weren't really rich or flaky. Using the Pepper Plant pepper sauce made it a little better, thanks to the savory spices and the moderate kick of heat, but it wasn't enough. The side of country potatoes was pretty enjoyable at least, but not quite addictive.

I also found little to write home about in the Bananas Foster French Toast ($11.95). The caramelized bananas were nice, but I think the heaps of whipped cream weren't enough to cover up boring, overly chewy French toast that was rather bland other than the cinnamon flavor.

What I'd possibly drive back for are the pancakes. Despite my massive food coma afterward, I don't regret going for the carbs. I ordered the Banana Walnut Pancakes ($9.50), which were fluffy and buttery and held up even as leftovers a few hours later. The banana was incorporated into the batter, and the crunchy walnuts were the perfect complement in flavor and texture. You almost don't need the syrup with these pancakes. And lest you think I'm cutting back, I had to get a to-go box because those pancakes are quite literally as big as my head.

Expect huge portions at Mimosas Gourmet, but stick to the pancakes and perhaps look into some of the foods which I didn't try. I'd avoid the French Toast menu, but maybe I was simply unlucky enough to run into the lone dud of the Eggs Benedict selections.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,6,3,kr88T44PKkAaH1pECApJkg

Simply stated; It is very good. Quality ingredients, well prepared food, and lots of it! No matter what you order, you'll enjoy the taste and you won't walk away hungry. You can't lose eating here. The name ""Mimosas"" is misleading, but ""what's in a name?""

For my first experience, I enjoyed a Corned Beef Hash Skillet. There was no sign of that dynamic dual that usually appears on a restaurant Corned Beef Dinner. Both Hormel and Dinty Moore, were not there. Instead it was a well prepared brisket, done up right, and served with two eggs, over easy, and a huge portion of cottage potatoes. Very good.

This is a place that I will take my sons to for lunch. The menu is deverse as it is good, and those two hungry Neanderthals will enjoy a meal that will satisfy them for the day. 

Okay, Mr. Jack, why not break down and give them a 5?  

Because they are only open for Breakfast and Lunch. Do go there, before you drive out and wait in an hour long line for Cracker Barrel. This place is much better, and more reasonably priced.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,0,0,4,1uMgD06B-LxmuzWQUs5ncw

I ordered a coffee which was good and the size was big. The mug was a good size and I liked that. My wife ordered their original mimosas which was in a mason jar with fruit and it tasted pretty good. The orange juice taste fresh. 

The food was good. However, my potatoes were just ""Warm"" like they've been sitting for a few minutes after it was already plated and ready to go. The food didn't really give me a wow factor. But the portions was on point. 

I thought this place was cute and the food and portions were good. I'm taking one star away because it took a while for our and the place wasn't that busy. I already finished a cup of coffee and my wife finished her mimosa by the time we finally got our food. Granted I saw a lot of Uber Eats bags being prepared but still. Hungry customers aren't a good thing! Lol.

4382491,2018-06-11,0,jxbEwtV8Et1lm8ubk4AGuw,"My husband and I joined friends for brunch at Mimosas recently and loved our brunch. The mimosas were plenty strong too. Christie L. made a good pick on this one.

The menu offers plenty to choose from for brunch, almost too much! They offer scrambles, waffles, salads, benedicts, French Toast, omelets, pancakes, sandwiches, specialty entrees like huevos rancheros, burgers, and skillets. Even the mimosas are offered in about a dozen different flavors. Don't worry if mimosas aren't your thing because they have other drinks like Bloody Mary's too. 

We started with mimosas that were strong. They were served in a large round glass and had a nice flavor. The mimosas were a bit different than traditional mimosas, but still good. The flavor was similar to a sparkling soda. 

My husband and I shared three dishes, all were great! My husband ordered a sandwich that was tasty, but the homemade fries were the highlight. The Crab, Prawn, and Avocado Benedict was large and delicious. Everything on this dish was perfectly prepared and I loved the side of crispy hashbrowns. As much as we enjoyed these dishes the highlight of brunch had to be the Churro Waffles. These were amazing with such a great flavor. Just to add to the decadence the waffle was served with an entire scoop of ice cream on top.

The service was quick and attentive. Even in a group the service didn't miss a beat. Our food came to the table without much of a wait. We didn't have any issues with getting separate checks at the end.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,2,5,XV86_qJoTUloILCfa78l8A

Why does the service take so long if the restaurant isn't packed? Once our order finally arrives to our table I find that it has green onions on my meat lovers skillet which I very specifically did not want and double checked with our server, Alex. After telling him how disappointed we were with the experience, being it was our first time, he apologized and left. Then someone from the kitchen wearing a hairnet comes out to our table attempting to take my plate saying she's gunna remake my order so it's correct. She was extremely argumentative and abrasive.

Perhaps this is still a hidden gem-- definitely not in an area you would think to have brunch at. Anyway, YES you can make reservations, unlike several other brunch places, is a really nice service. 

They have a little set up for coffee outside which is SO nice of them-- free coffee while you wait.

Their menu is vast! So many good things to try. Portions are comparable to Hash House-- shareable and humungo! 

I had the crab/shrimp omelette covered in hollandaise with a side of hash browns and a pancake. It was really good. My friend had the fried chicken benedict- our server gave her the option of two sauces which was really cool (gravy and hollandaise). 

Service is quick, efficient, and very friendly. If you check in you get a free coffee with refills.

5227438,2017-09-23,0,jxbEwtV8Et1lm8ubk4AGuw,"I'll admit that most of my 2-Star review is based on the owner/manager not accepting my Groupon that was for 4 people (we had a party of 3).  We spent well over the Groupon amount and I thought, like my other favorite sit-downs (Egg Works in Summerlin and Shabu Shabu on Sahara), this place would honor the Groupon, especially that we had spent at least $40 over the Groupon amount.  To top it off, owner/manager was pretty rude about it by saying bluntly ""should've read the fine print""... I know, petty.  But you're in the business of customer service!

Wife is an Egg Benedict's connoisseur and she wasn't impressed with their plate.  Again, she actually prefers the more country style version at Egg Works.  I went safe with Eggs and Bacon and fortunately, they didn't mess that up. I don't recall what the third person got but I don't remember her being impressed.

The mimosas were tasty, but at their price point in relation to service quality, food quality, and interior space and design, I'd rather pay double for a better experience on The Strip.  I'm interested in seeing what type champagne they use.  Either way, you can make them yourself with your own quality bottle along with your choice of Sunkist, Tropicana or Minute Maid... OR, WAIT FOR IT... SIMPLY ORANGE!!!

Yeah, not impressed with this place.  You guys saved $30 from not honoring a semi-valid :) Groupon but lost an avid wannabe Elite Yelper for life!!!",jEBxd2sNpDM2A_Lu0uN60A,1,0,2,9QWRIL1JCalMVovumAkvag

An expansion from its 2016 debut in San Jose California, Mimosas Gourmet recently opened at 3455 South Durango Drive, the location directly next to well-regarded  La Maison de Maggie Crepe Shop breathing life into a dilapidated strip mall near the Desert Breeze Soccer Complex on the corner of Spring Mountain.

Replacing a former restaurant and open now for just over a few weeks, Mimosas Gourmet offers diners a collection of their eponymous beverage in a wide range of shapes and sizes, the bill of fare itself quite sizable while the 2,500 square foot space features relatively typical seating options, the stero overhead playing IHeartRadio at a fairly loud volume, though not loud enough that conversation is impaired.

Sharing one $8.50 Guava Mimosa, a $3.99 Biscuit and a trio of the restaurant's more interesting plates, it was in piecemeal fashion as dishes were prepared that items were sent forth from the kitchen, the bubbly beverage far more bitter than those many in Sin City with sliced Strawberries and Oranges on top for a touch of visual flare.

Receiving the Churro Waffle and one mistaken plate first, the order re-confirmed and very obviously resubmitted to the kitchen given the delivery times to follow, the team could go a long way by promoting this item as a 'signature' with both the interior and top of the dough featuring a generous amount of Cinnamon and Sugar, the faux-Maple Syrup not a personal favorite but really not so bad when paired with a globe of Vanilla Ice Cream that slowly melts and melds the flavors.

Maroon 5 followed by Bruno Mars, the crowd a wide range of ages and ethnicities, it was after some delay that the Bacon-studded Waffle topped with crisp Chicken Fingers arrived with Honey already added, both items well prepared if not particularly memorable while the overpriced biscuit was fluffy and delicious despite being more like a jumbo dinner roll than something with proper buttery layers.

Serving large portions, the biggest and richest yet to come, it was another ten minutes before the three-piece tower of French Toast landed to the right of un-cleared plates and empty Water glasses, this diabolical concoction seeing melted Marshmallow Fluff and at least a tablespoon of Nutella at top, middle and bottom, the Cinnamon and Ginger not entirely lost either thought the center piece of toast was so overly saturated with toppings that it almost ate like Custard.   

*** Not exactly ""locally owned,"" but nonetheless doing some interesting spins on Breakfast and Lunch classics in a space that is comfortable and easily accessible to those in Spring Valley or Summerlin, Mimosas Gourmet joins an ever-growing list of places to consider for breakfast when tired of the same ol' same ol' and for those unwilling to go looking for better in the Southeast or on the Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,6,3,1-gRoI-3bA-8uMN0YEY2Eg

Environment: The exterior of the restaurant is a little bit underwhelming, with the restaurant being in the middle of a strip mall and with a lackluster banner. Upon entering, the inside is open, however I would not say it is much more impressive than the outside. I think it could use a different color scheme or maybe some more decorating. 

Food: The food was good, and the portions were very generous. I ordered the Mexican skillet which came with potatoes mushrooms, avocado, sausage, and salsa. All the flavors went together well and it was very filling. Additionally, it was served which a biscuit which was HUGE. A point I did find interesting is that upon looking at the drink section of the menu it had stated that they did not have their liquor license so they were unable to serve any alcohol, which seemed a little contradictory since the restaurant has the word mimosa in the name yet we were unable to order one. Despite this the list did look extensive so once they do get their license I would be more than happy to try two or three of them haha.

Overall I don't know if I will come here again any time soon due to the location but if you are in the area and are looking for a nice breakfast spot I would recommend trying this place out",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,4,TXoqPK9shjg__hlA3CSyAA

Nice atmosphere, friendly waitress.  First time here - the menu is extensive! Lots of diversity and selection. Nice variety of mimosas too. 

We ordered corned beef hash with over medium eggs & hash browns and a meat lovers scramble skillet. Unfortunately, our meal came out incorrect with scrambled eggs instead of over medium. The home made corned beef hash had a ton of potatoes in comparison to the amount of beef in the dish. Standard hash browns. Hunny enjoyed his meat lovers skillet but would have enjoyed more without the sour cream drizzle. Again, lots of potatoes in comparison to the meat.

When you drive up you think...meh...it's in a strip mall...a French crepe place next door almost had me derail to croissants but I stayed on task. 

We walked in and there were plenty of seats and he instantly gave us a nice booth. The menu is filled with a lot of scrumptious looking items and it definitely had a southwest flare to it. And let's not
Forget to mention there were a lot of alcoholic beverages to choose from. They have a full bar. The mimosas look to be mixed with wine not champagne. I'll have to try it on
The next visit. 

Happy to see chilaquiles on the menu I'll try that next time. I ordered a Mexican skillet and my daughter ordered an omelette and added steak. We ordered a chocolate chip pancake to share. 

Omg the food was sooo good. The steak in the Mexican skillet with the mushrooms...yummy. The chocolate chip pancake was so good and it
Had that crunchy crust on the bottom! My daughter said hers was good but I think she liked my steak better they must have used a different meat and they didn't put much in it. We did have to pick apart her omlette and search to see if it was just a mistake. But we found a couple of pieces. So I wouldn't recommend the add on steam unless you're specific about the steak etc. 

The waiter was concerned we didn't like the food because we had quite A bit left and we didn't want a doggy bag. Well the portions are huge and we don't typically take breakfast stuff home. But

The coffee is sadly pretty lousy and at $2 (free refills), certainly not a good deal. Overall I think the prices are a little too high. The food is tasty though.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,3,3,LnDwpN7kBSyL6GvzySocSA
5747326,2018-03-01,0,jxbEwtV8Et1lm8ubk4AGuw,"Came in on a Saturday with a big group during peak brunch hours, so of course there was a wait. But they still worked fast and got us in without too bad of a wait.  
You can't go to a place called Minosas and not order a mimosa! Sampling a few of the flavors, mango was my favorite, although all were good. And strong, they were definitely strong! 
The food itself was also very good. Most of the dishes were massive servings, great for saving some for later. Everything tasted great on all the dishes we got. The only downside brought up was all the benedicts lacked that runny yolk you crave. 

Kind of a smaller place, so expect a wait if you go during peak hours, but you can also expect good food, fast service, and strong mimosas!",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,3,2,5,tR6NbRNJ7QCMVDw_AnPREA

The menu is loaded with lots of delicious items, the full breakfast fare plus burgers, sandwiches, and salads. We went with the smoked salmon benedict and the fried chicken benedict. 

Both were delicious. Fried chicken benedict was tasty, the sausage gravy very mild so add your own pepper. I enjoyed the smoked salmon as well, maybe more cream cheese. Hollandaise sauce was nice and light, not clumpy or heavy. I would have liked a slice of lemon to add some citrus to it. 

I heard the pancakes were great, and the plates that passed by would confirm that. I will be back again to try those. 

Overall, I liked the food and presentation very much. Service was on point. Price was fair at under $50 for two plus Bloody Marys. I will return.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,5,4,4,Uf6D1GlLzS7cGBbP2uIfQQ

Apparently there some kind of liquor license issue, and they say it's posted on the website. But, I didn't see it when I read through their menu of mimosas on their website. Food was generous and good, but service was slow. It was disappointing as we really wanted to have drinks at our branch. I doubt we'll be back.",N3YS4t0RSve4SeO_89Iurg,0,0,2,rm_wmtPfr06xSr8X4_70Sg

Newly opened. Family environment

Slightly over priced but the plate is huge. I had the herb chicken skillet, $13, couldn't finish it. Great place if you're coming with someone, you can split a plate. 

Lots of flavor mimosas. Absolutely delicious, $8.50.

Additionally, you can get a gigantic (and I mean GIGANTIC) mimosa! It's awesome. The food is great too. This place actually cooked my bacon the way I like it - crispy! Yum. The eggs I ordered were actually real eggs and not the pre-mixed stuff that other places used.  The use of real eggs is a huge plus in my book. I had the waffle combo - it comes with eggs, bacon or sausage and a waffle. This place is pretty much on par with other breakfast food places with regard to price. I'm definitely going back to get the huge mimosa. It's a small restaurant but it appears to have a strong following in the community. This is a nice little place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. Perfect for breakfast with friends and family.",kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,0,5,mYhc4JJPtqyv0YXSfRKP7g

The lovely server suggested lychee, and just one put me in the clouds. I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else in Vegas for brunch except for one place on the strip.
