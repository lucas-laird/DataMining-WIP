1321341,2011-12-20,0,-vb_yx5QnIhpXUIdPVD2og,One of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas. Been going to this restaurant for 16 years and it never gets old.  Never too busy and great prices for lunch specials.,or92W4NpaWbaHIQKS0kVtg,1,1,4,68Tb3TD1uoK25peV9oa2JA
2398272,2012-12-23,0,-vb_yx5QnIhpXUIdPVD2og,"The only two things I purchase from this restaurant are the Egg Foo Young and Cashew Chicken.  Every thing else on the menu is substandard.  

The two things they do well, they do very well.  In fact, it's the best in town.  The protein is actually cooked within the pancake itself which lends to good texture.  It is made with mostly egg and not with a lot of flour and the gravy is not too salty and is just thick enough to make it a hearty meal.  The best part of the cashew chicken is the zucchini.  It's diced to perfection and not over cooked.  It's the perfect al dente.  

The one major negative is that twice, I've ordered a specific item and was told they had a special that was better.  I informed the waiter that I wanted what i ordered instead, and upon bringing my order home, I've found that they substituted my order for what they were attempting me to purchase.  I don't appreciate the bait and switch for what I believe was their attempt to get rid of a particular food.  

However, not finding good :Egg Foo Young made well anywhere else, I find I come back for more.",Kr-nF7n17b2N3aFRcgKAJA,0,0,3,VU6yb9djEXnVhlp-jx0J5w

5735711,2012-02-03,0,-vb_yx5QnIhpXUIdPVD2og,Pretty good hole in the wall Chinese place. The best thing about it are the lunch specials. I pay $4.90 including tax for bbq pork fried rice and kung pao chicken and it actually tastes good. Can't beat that!! They have other combinations you can get as well for the same price.,6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,1,0,3,Y3HQemyx9b-abC6HX2DyIg

My Lomein was above par and made with fresh vegitables and the Shrimp was fresh as well; Not something I'm used to in Lomein.  The one major surprise was the flaming PuPu Plater.  Neither one of us had tried that before and we both absolutely loved it! 

They bring out a sample platter of a few different foods/raw meat and let you season everything to your liking and then heat it all over top of an open flame. It was nice being your own chef in an actual Asian Restaurant. 

The only reason I only gave 4 stars is due to the lack of Fountain Soda; Everything comes in Cans. We've been to a few small shops like this one where they didn't have fountain drinks and it just seems weird to pop open a can inside a restaurant. 

I think I may just have to take her back on our next day off!",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,4,gJDRk9YihpQ1AbmvN2NxuQ
