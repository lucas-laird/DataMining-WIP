Waited over twenty minutes, finally caught the counter girl trying to serve my shrimp bowl to a dine in customer when I had a to go order. Waited longer for my two fish tacos, never a thank you, no one there speaks legible English! When I got home and ate the tacos, the fish was so over cooked it was like leather, and cold as hell because they had been sitting forever before I was served. I've had bad experiences every time there, so never again. Go up the street a few blocks to Rubios, much better!!!!",FXrtiumOPdr7uZSBbSoBgw,0,0,3,IW_J6YIJ0uEEKJwJzPTk_g

The moment I walked in the door I was warmly greeted by Gisela with her gorgeous smile asking if I was ready to order or needed more time. she respected that I needed a few minutes to decide then came over. She also patiently took my annoying order ""little of this, none of that, don't forget..."" she repeated it back perfectly and even asked personally, ""Are you having a rough day?"" ... to which I just said I'm looking forward to my next day off. Still, who asks about your day anymore?! awesome stuff. 

Not to stop there... as I found a table to sit and wait for my burrito, she came over and apologized saying ""I might have sprayed a product with bleach here. sorry"" well I don't see any stains on my uniform and it's not like it was her fault anyways. 

I even watched her as she told the cook precisely how I wanted everything prepared and it came out perfectly and tasty. 

Excellent customer service! she even mentioned ""have a good day & come back here soon"" I'll have to take her up on that since I work nearby. 

I know it's just Baja Fresh, but if you haven't visited this location or had the pleasure of meeting Gisela then you're missing out on an awesome guest experience.",B7_4IcWNdRq2VZozF34BZQ,7,7,5,gCrOtmMbx5oFytZN86ONNQ

I used to be a big fan of baja fresh but this location is disappointing to say the least. First, I ordered a baja burrito bowl (which I've ordered many times before). It's basically a burrito without the tortilla. I received a salad - no rice! I didn't check my order until I got back to my office (ugh).

Second, I usually love their baja salsa. But the one I had today was literally 4 times as spicy as usual. I could barely eat it! 

My entire lunch was ruined. Won't be going back to this location. As others have said, it's no wonder they were empty during the peak lunch hour.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,0,0,2,JEQTKE8DmVDKmKifggpoiA

And my mind was changed! Their quality is higher than fast-food caliber, produce is fresh, salads are huge. None of these things I can say about Del Taco or Taco Bell.

Menu has tacos and burritos, nachos and flautas, bowls and salads- quite a few of them! Lots of customization options, too, and sides include chips and salsa, guac, or cheese. Opted for the Cilantro Lime Shrimp salad and a chicken tortilla soup- even though I really wanted nachos.

Salad was huge and fresh, tons of shrimp (8-10) with a tasty cilantro sauce and at least half of an avocado. Soup was a bit on the greasy side but had a ton of chicken and good overall flavor. 

Probably won't make this a regular place, but glad to know quality is better than their exterior suggests.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,1,3,IBkkyKK-7KhOEdQc_VmR8w

3085666,2016-04-12,0,rMVi-Vn_mN_X9J1ZSl1lWA,"I came to this Baja Fresh during a Thursday evening.

Atmosphere: Nothing special
Upon entering this establishment, it was almost empty. There was music in the background, and the place was pretty clean. The workers didn't seem to be doing much because of the lack of patrons present.

Service: Again, nothing special
I gave my order to the cashier and she gave me a receipt. She asked me what kind of beans I wanted in my burrito, I told her black, no complication there at all. No smile, nothing out of the ordinary that made it spectacular nor horrible.

Food: Bad Food, Bad Sanitation practices
This is where my visit takes a turn for the worst. I haven't been to Baja Fresh in a few years, so I was thinking that this visit would remind me of when I liked them. The salsa was pretty good, to be honest. However, when I got my nacho burrito, I failed to tasted anything nacho-like. I looked into the burrito and notices little tortilla crisps, but because of the moisture of all the other ingredients inside the burrito, they had lost their crunch. There was also a lack of cheese flavor; you know, the cheese flavor that you would taste when you have nachos. What really ruined it was knowing that almost half of the burrito consisted of beans. It was as if they added extra beans behind my back. Not once in my order did I mention beans other than when I was asked what type of beans I wanted. I know about food costing and ""dragging out"" food so that the other ingredients last longer, but this was RIDICULOUS.

Oh yeah, and while I was eating, one of the workers coughed and failed to wash their hands afterwards. How gross is that? If I go to a restaurant and a worker coughs in the open while preparing food I'm never coming back to that branch again. Yes, it was indeed ""cold season"" when I visited, but if you're sick, STAY HOME. 

Overall: Don't even think about coming here
This is one of my few Yelp reviews where I type in caps, but I think it's necessary to emphasize my points and feelings. The only positive thing I can say about this place would be that it was clean and presentable to the public. Unfortunately, their lack of sanitation practices and willingness to fill my burrito halfway with beans ruined my perception of Baja Fresh's reputation. I'm never coming back, and you shouldn't either.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,2,0,1,Ke4pgxgFb0otWB7hdlg2Uw

I'm not sure what happened, but we did not get what we ordered. Yes, we should have verified our order with our receipt, but we have ordered the same thing many times. We wanted the battered fish tacos, but got the grilled instead. They were good, but not what we were looking forward to today. 

I love their salsa bar with the variety of salsas, Pico and limes. We got a healthy serving of tortilla chips. Unfortunately, I think that we got the leftovers from the previous day since we arrived shortly after they opened. They were stale. Blah. 

The set up here was odd. There was the main dining area, and then a whole other side with a soda machine and condiment area. Except, there were no condiments, and I'm not sure the soda machine worked over there. The ceiling fans were on high, and were blowing our napkins around. The music came on a few minutes after we arrived, and was way too loud.

4578357,2017-06-19,0,rMVi-Vn_mN_X9J1ZSl1lWA,"I'm basing this review off of two experiences, and one I didn't even get food. I had ordered through a third party delivery service where we ordered a Baja Burrito with pork carnitas, a Chicken Quesadilla and an order of Smoky Queso Fundido. When the driver got to the restaurant he called me and let me know that they told him that they were out of carnitas. He put me on the phone with them and the lady was VERY nice. She gave me three options, she could replace the protein choice with either chicken, beef or white fish. I told her I didn't really want the beef or white fish, but I could take chicken yet my concern was I paid extra for the carnitas. The next option was shrimp (the most expensive protein) and she was totally happy to do that for me and add extra cheese with no extra charge. She really made me feel better about my order and I was happy.

Unfortunately, the third party driver called about about 7 minutes later with a flat tire! Apparently it was in the stars I wouldn't get Baja that night. But it was alright, I made other arrangements and the third party company gave me a $10.00 coupon off my next order for the troubles.

So... last night I tried again with Baja, using the coupon so we got a little more. Exactly the same order as before only with some added chicken taquitos and a side of beans and rice. Since it was through a website, I called the restaurant and let them know we wanted extra cheese (no option on the website) and they were super okay with it with no extra charge. 

The food arrived fresh and delicious. The taquitos were still SUPER crispy and yummy, and they use real guacamole. My burrito was delicious and I absolutely loved their smokey queso (although for such a large portion we really needed more chips) I tried the quesadilla and it was good, nothing extraordinary (chicken and cheese). 

To sum it up, food was fresh and tasty and they went above and beyond for customer service, I'll be ordering from them again soon!!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,1,5,8QO2Wj23btdN-K-RjB3YEQ

Pretty sure I could feed the burrito to my 5 month old daughter and her pediatrician would not have objected.  That's how soggy it is.  It's also possible that a combination of Cafe Rio in combination with the plethora of authentic Mexican Food in this city has spoiled me in regards to Mexican food.  The salsa was really chunky too.  I know some people enjoy the consistency of a good pico de gallo but that is really not my thing.  Bottom line is I did not enjoy my lunch here.  I thought it was over priced for the quality of what I got.  It's the southwest man...THE SOUTHWEST.

Their salsa bar is always well stocked and clean, and I just can't get enough of their black salsa. It's not spicy, it's just so good! I have not been able to tear myself away from the tostada salad yet but a few other things on the menu look good.

Honestly I am somewhat snobby about authentic Mexican food. This is not authentic, but it's still very tasty and that more than makes up for that. Also they have plentiful outdoor seating unlike other Bajas I have been to.",v8QVTSPCW1LBzE_j_jT7YQ,0,0,4,YVBIijJppZUq385BLzbe4w
5212480,2015-04-04,0,rMVi-Vn_mN_X9J1ZSl1lWA,"What can I say about Baja Fresh? I used to work near this location, and as a quick place to have lunch, it was o.k. Not a bad price. Relatively good food, hot and fast. Pretty good salsa bar. 

Hadn't been in a Baja Fresh in a few years because there are more Mexican food places that I like much better, closer to where I live (like Roberto's, for instance). Anyway, on April 3, me and some friends decided to stop in to the 7501 W. Lake Mead, Summerlin location for lunch. Big mistake! Place was pretty empty at lunch time. That should have told me something.

I wanted fish tacos, so on the menu board there were 2 choices. ""Wahoo"" and ""Crispy Wahoo"".  I ordered 2 taco platter with Crispy Wahoo taco and one shrimp taco. After my friend ordered her meal, she was told that the ""Crispy Wahoo"" was not fried but grilled. O.k. I had to then make sure that the girl at the counter knew that I wanted fried. I asked why there were 2 different menu choices IF BOTH WERE GRILLED? I was met with the same kind of stare my dog would have given if I'd asked him the same question. From reading another Yelp review, this is an ongoing problem apparently. The menu choices need to be clear!

My order was delayed. When I got it, it was wrong. They forgot the shrimp taco. When I finally got the shrimp taco, it was cold. My friend's kid got rolled tacos that he said tasted like soap. So that order also had to be sent back. The general manager that day was grouchy and not in the greatest of moods. He acted like we didn't know what we were talking about. He said ""No one has ever complained before!"" Whatever. I got a new taco, and my friend's kid also got a new meal, but by that time we didn't really want anything else. 

The counter girl/server was nice and tried to be accommodating. The complimentary chips were pretty stale. The pinto beans, rice and salsas were decent. I wouldn't recommend this location and  I'll never go back there.",Z_zSqGECvZVrFr2QheoYYQ,1,0,1,9lE9quH8KqoS49PAeLk0Tg

Not long ago, after ordering a taco combo plate, I had to return it because it was smothered in sour cream (for the first time in many visits). No big deal. Stuff happens, right? Well, everyone behind the counter acted like I was somehow at fault. The menus (paper and board) plainly list all of the stuff that comes on each item. Sour cream is listed in neither place, but they acted like I was being difficult for only wanting what was advertised on my tacos. ""No crema?"" over and over again. No...because it doesn't come on it! Granted, it was in Spanish, but the entire staff seemed to spend the next 10 minutes loudly debating the situation, the cook rolling his eyes and the server repeatedly checking the paper menu for proof of my mistake. Even on the 5th time, it still didn't say anything about sour cream. I will say that the manager did quickly step-in and tell them to remake my food, but even he seemed not to believe that they had messed-up in any way, that it was my fault. Eh, it is what it is. Everyone is entitled to an off day, right? Then last night, when my wife and I went back in, I made it a point to just go ahead and avoid any possible confusion by ordering my food without sour cream (that it obviously isn't supposed to come with in the first place). ""It doesn't come with it, sir.""? Really? No shit? Well, maybe you should inform the rest of your staff because they clearly didn't get the memo. Anyway, when my wife tried to order a small plate of nachos, the cashier told her that they only had large plates left, so she had to order a large nacho instead. My wife asked why they couldn't just put the small portion on the larger plate for the appropriate price (It wasn't her fault their stock order was short), but the girl just smiled, said something that I think was mumbled Spanish and cheerfully said ""No"". That was that. Now, neither experience is some kind of massive, unbelievable offense, but they were both rather frustrating and, far beyond that, textbook examples of substandard, lazy, utterly unconcerned customer service.
