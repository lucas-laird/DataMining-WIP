When I arrived I was greeted by a young lady leaning on the counter texting (granted it was 1:30am) once I got her attention it was fair service, some issue with accent/word usage with ordering, she seemed to push upsizing and current offers a bit too much though.

With the meal, it's nothing to bring home, I got a medium BBQ Whopper, which was one of the best burgers I've got from fast food, although the chips were nothing to brag about, they were cooked fresh seeing I was the only one there, however they were very oily and not very crisp, also the tables weren't all to clean, even though no one else was there, so there was plenty of time to clean up.

So apart from the burger itself, I wouldn't be returning, Subway and the Buffet both seem to have better choices",Zgn0UTzEFzkX2_s4mSyNQQ,0,0,2,4W1CSLitQcHxv0toDx5kaw

I just grabbed some nuggets because they are advertised at $1.49.  I'm surprised they honor the sales, usually they don't.",2-V9dclHMYG0U8TEIWD5jw,3,0,2,1cZjktu9maFRI7ztmMZznQ
