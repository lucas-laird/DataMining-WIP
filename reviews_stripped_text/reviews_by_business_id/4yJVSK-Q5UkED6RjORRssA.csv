1521097,2018-04-16,0,4yJVSK-Q5UkED6RjORRssA,Party of 3 for lunch. First time there. Two had a chef salad that was good but nothing special. I had a hamburger that tasted unlike most burgers. It didn't sicken me so not sure what it was. Fries were ordinary. Service was ok. We're the only ones there. Doubt we'll return.,dDfyN0ExD5-3PKxL3sv9eA,0,0,3,HwadTa2QBIKLzj6L6c08xQ

Inside has a very intimate setting. The dim lighting and white upholstery gives it a modern look but with some casino vibe. The menu has alot of options. Lots of seafood,pasta and steak options. 
We walked in and ordered 5 pupusas revueltas (tortilla stuffed with beans,cheese,pork) at $2.25 each to go. And that took 20 minutes to make fml. So definitely order ahead of time to avoid wait time. Once we got home they were soo good! At most places you go to they will cheap out on you and put more beans and cheese and barely any pork. But these had alot of pork. The size was about my palm and it was very thick.  Came with curtido and tomato sauce. Maybe I'll come back and try the rest of what they have to offer.",AKRmB1u4S7ckLXO3Pl74Cw,2,0,3,NjteHosC0jCs6TEhvHVnNw

2891468,2018-03-07,0,4yJVSK-Q5UkED6RjORRssA,Ate here with a friend on the night before my birthday. The staff was very friendly and patient as well as took the time to explain to us what items on the menu was and give their opinion. The food was excellent. We ordered the seafood soup and the crab with stuffed potato. I don't recall the names from the menu. We will be returning soon with friends.,KXKrVPko40tE-713YjDEGw,0,0,5,Yp4Vp4IZ90G5et39YcnWQg

4139543,2018-06-04,0,4yJVSK-Q5UkED6RjORRssA,"Good food, reasonable prices.  Large portions.  Service is excellent. Had the Coquilles de Mariscos for appetizer.  We each had the shrimp for dinner.  I had the tempura shrimp and my hubby had the other type of shrimp.  Both were very good.  Lots of food.  Go there with a big appetite. The chips and salsa were great.  Because I had read the review that there was a 20 minute wait for the pupusas, I ordered them ahead of time ""to go"" so I would have a snack for later.....however, I was still full from dinner.  Very clean restaurant.  The decor is quite beautiful.  Will go back and try some other dishes.",7B7lExeKnT4HqPtfPh5Sbg,0,0,4,rvAsuGNySjXPk7k2ALPVpQ

4653349,2018-03-15,0,4yJVSK-Q5UkED6RjORRssA,"El Congo is a brand new restaurant on Rainbow & Smoke Ranch.
Everything inside this place is new and very clean!  Don't be thrown off by it's name.  They serve a wide variety of International dishes.  This place is a Must-Try; Must-Go!

Been to this place twice and each time, we were very pleased and delighted with the food, service and the prices!  Very affordable & delicious food!

The first time, we ordered the ""Mix"".  A platter filled with delicious seafood ~ meaty lobster & crab, large shrimps cooked in different styles.  The second time, we all each had their very tasty ribeye.  We also had some pupusas.  I love that their chips come with salsa that is not spicy.  I'm sure if you want it spicy, they'll make it that way for you.

We can hardly wait to go back and try more dishes from El Congo.  By the way, El Congo is a place in El Salvador.",n0ipqJw5oCqKYsjJqs--_A,1,1,5,r75COX-78x-KFijrzqf9xA
