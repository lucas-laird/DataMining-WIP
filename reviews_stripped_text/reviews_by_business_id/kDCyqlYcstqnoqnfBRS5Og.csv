1246036,2017-06-19,0,kDCyqlYcstqnoqnfBRS5Og,"The menu on the wall was too small for me to read (and I don't require glasses). I had to squint, and since there were people sitting right beneath it (pretty much in front of it) I clearly made them uncomfortable looking so sternly in their direction.

I just paid $5 for a ""strawberry melonade"", and then watched this girl pour me a boring lemonade fountain drink and drip in some Torani strawberry flavoring and top it off with bottled water from a mini fridge.

I would've laughed and walked out if I hadn't already paid, but I was already the butt of this joke. I took my drink and expressed my displeasure with the lack of any fresh ingredients, and sat down to relax out of the 113 degree heat. 

Unfortunately I don't think this place has adequate AC, it felt like a balmy 85 degrees in this place. Perhaps building an entire wall of windows in a coffee shop in the desert wasn't prudent planning. Perhaps them filling my lemonade to the brim with ice was supposed to cool me down. My only reprieve was that there was so little lemonade in my cup that my lemonade was gone within 3 sips and I didn't have any further excuse to sit in this overrated, overpriced, overheated hipster haven, complete with a record player on the counter playing Bob Dylan and the 20-something year old boys in the corner calling each other bro.

My lemonade was drinkable and cold. That's the only reason Pour got 2 stars from me. You can get a better tasting cold drink for less money pretty much anywhere in this city. I'll probably try Heidi's deli in the same plaza next time. Their menu shows they have fresh juices and smoothies.",NGHKwJAhwk6NQ6cGfKsiKQ,0,0,2,_DETK-ud0sU235-65EyDjw

Ex boyfriend and I came in and I insisted he try the pistacio drink because I know how much he loves Pistaccios (sp) and he loved it, I ordered the sin city which was equally delish but what really impressed me was the 3 bean bowl I ordered, it comes with red onions and I asked for those to be removed, the girl said thats how it comes, pre-made, I said no worries I can pick around them...

When I got home to eat it, I discovered it had NO red onions, the woman who made it had custom made it for me, wow, I am so happy and its delicious by the way!

It had tomatoes which may have already been in there or switched for the onions, not sure, I dont know, I just will be returning there ASAP to have another bowl and more drinks!

They got your breakfast sandwiches as well as ""lunch"" sandwiches. Their drink menu is pretty big and they got some caffeine-free drinks available as well.

Boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Bombness sandwich and I ordered the Turkey and What Else sandwich which came with Lay's potato chips. I've got to admit, the sandwiches were on the smaller side. Even though I'm a small eater, my boyfriend and I could have easily split a second sandwich. I  guess it's a good thing the sandwiches are small...you can watch your calories. 

We were here on a Saturday afternoon and the one and only drink my boyfriend wanted to try was the Pistachio Delight and they were out of ingredients on the day we went!!!!!!!!!! What the..... how in the world..... why!? =( boo. If they had that item available, this review might been pushed up to 5 stars. So he ended up getting a cold brew iced coffee. He enjoyed it. You need a strong caffinee boost? Screw the big corporate places....come here and get yourself one of these! It'll definitely give you a huge pep in your step. Great tasting coffee. I got an iced coconut latte and it was delish!! 

We will definitely be back....there's other sandwiches I wanna try!",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,6,5,4,-1ulSyb-tXWBlyRGaFeU2w

Yeah, buddy. Coffee is my drug of choice (before 9 am) and Pour gave me a sweet fix. This small coffee house is right across the street from Sunset Park and is a great place to fill up or wind down after a rousing game of Disc Golf. As far as the food goes, I've only tried the English Muffin breakfast sandwich; it was tasty but overpriced. I would stick with the coffee options and a full sized sandwich to get a better bang for your buck. 

The coffee here is great, fresh espresso and simple, but perfect coffee drinks. Their cold brew is the way to go if you're into cold coffee drinks and the espresso pulls are smooth and rich. Heads up, when you check-in on Yelp you get 15% off your coffee order, kaboom!

2975741,2015-11-29,4,kDCyqlYcstqnoqnfBRS5Og,"Finally took the time to visit this spot since every time I'd think about going, I'd remember the construction on Eastern and just to go Sunrise Coffee instead lol. Pour is located across Sunset Park in a shopping center with Roberto's and Heidi's Brooklyn Deli with a small parking lot but a lot of empty spaces. Walking inside I was really surprised at how bright and clean it was. Large windows and lots of seating. Seems like a great spot for people bust out their laptops and chill.  However, I feel like their hours will really limit that being 7am-5pm Monday through Friday and 8am-2pm on Saturday and Sunday. Who knows, maybe they'll extend their hours if they get more popular especially since they're only about 10-15 minutes away from UNLV.

So as for the most important stuff, we tried their Iced Raspberry Chocolate at only $4.80 and oh man, this drink was incredibly smooth! Had almost like a velvet texture! Not as much strong coffee flavor that I get from Sunrise Coffee but I'd definitely compare this place to Grouchy John's. Bomb.com Definitely recommend getting this one. They also offer a lot of cool options on their menu including non-espresso items like their Pistachio Delight (which I'll probably try next time) and Paninis served from 8am-2pm. Paninis=awesome. Time limit on Paninis=not so awesome. But I'm definitely eyeing their Caribbean Special which includes fried plantains, mustard, hot sauce, avocado, tomatoes and turkey! Also their Apple Cheddar sounds pretty cool including fig jam, apples, olive oil and cheddar. As for other food options, they have waffles (served only Saturday and Sunday) and bakery items like mini salted caramel apple pies, chocolate brownies, and vegan chocolate chip cookies! Basically I feel like this place is a mix between Grouchy John's and Tiabi Coffee & Waffles, which in my opinion is pretty amazing.

As for service, everyone was really friendly. I'd only recommend they turn the music a little bit up, since it was a little awkward with it being so quiet. But overall, I'll definitely be back to try more drinks and some of their tasty sounding waffles and paninis :)",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,11,9,4,hZIWnRf7l30owhqN8Mvopg

I love love LOVE all the succulents around the windowd, on the counter, and on the tables. Many of them have little price stickers on them if you feel compelled to purchase one, along with the business owner's cards so that you can check them out yourself. Just the fact that those cards were around the place, and that they allow Vegas musicians to perform here, tells me they hugely support local work, which I appreciate! It's well lit inside and spacious, and it seems like a great spot to work on your laptop.

Typically I like my drinks chocolatey, but not too chocolatey. I'm kind of picky with what I like to drink and was worried that the Chocolate Iced Latte sub soy milk would be too sweet or too ""coffee"" tasting, but this wasn't the case. My drink tasted so good! 

As for the food, I ordered the Breakfast Bombness. Tasty, but small. I do wish it was a little bigger, since I think it was a little over $5 and the size of a egg mcmuffin, if not a bit smaller. However, it did taste very good!

**Update: Stopped by for a couple more visits. Construction still ongoing. Their cold brew and iced coffee have been consistently smooth and pretty potent if you're going for the wakefulness factor.

Stopped by yesterday to give it a try and am so glad I did. First thing I noticed as I walked in was how clean and bright the coffee shop was. I loved how the place was bright with natural lighting from all the large glass windows they have wrapped around the shop. All empty tables were clean, chairs were put in their proper place, tables had a nice plant on it which you can also buy, floors clean, trash was emptied, and the place were customers came put their empty cups was clean and organized as well. 

When I entered I was immediately greeted by one of the ladies working. She was very cheerful, had a smile on her face, and had a pleasant attitude about her. After I looked over their menu, I decided to try their hot mocha latte. By far, it was the best Mocha I've ever had. It was super smooth without leaving a gritty residue on the bottom of the cup which I've come to expect from Starbucks mocha. 

As I enjoyed my coffee, I also enjoyed the quiet atmosphere. The music they had playing was soft but loud enough that you could tell what was playing. The other customers in the shop were considerate of others and made sure to keep their conversations low as to not disturb others that were studying. 

The shop was nicely decorated with paintings, plants, and other coffee-related decoration without looking cluttered. 

Would recommend this spot to anyone who loves coffee.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,29,31,5,xGmhX38AwAM-gC7g2lfvYQ

Well, my experience was great!

I ordered an iced latte and the Breakfast Bombness which translates to heaven on a wheat English muffin. The muffin was hot and filled with the lightest scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato, cream cheese and spinach. It was healthy and delicious so whats not to like? My latte was one of the best I have had in a very long time.

Did I mention that the coffee aroma grabs you the minute you walk in the door? Or that this place is so clean that you could literally eat off of the floor?

It's a great place to study since it's quiet, bright, and spacious. I'm a huge fan of the bright, natural light they get in the store itself. It looks like they have a bookcase with records and a record player near the cashier, so I'm assuming you can choose one and ask them to play it. Really neat idea on their part!

The menu has your classic lattes, coffees, cold brews, pour overs, etc, but there's also some more original creations like the red bull express. I got the london fog with almond milk, and I like how it's not overly sweet. It's just a hint of sweetness, and the tea flavor is very evident. The drink itself has that fragrant bergamot. I can only vouch for the london fog as of right now, but Pour is charming and will have you coming back.

They do have a ""Study Sesh"" on Wednesday where drinks are 2 for 1, so you can hang out, study, and get a great deal on coffee. Combined with a 15% off for university students, what's not to love?

Overall, Pour is a solid study and coffee shop. It's quiet, spacious, and bright-- aka perfect for studying. The pricing is pretty decent and with 15% off for students, it's a great deal. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,34,23,5,6aGqWI4DAH9j0YJPToiqQA

Pour is located on Eastern between Warm Springs and Sunset. They are in the same lot as Heidi's and the Subway. The location is easy to access and there was plenty of parking even at noon on a weekday.

The menu offers sandwiches, coffees, unique blended beverages, sweets, teas, and waffles (on weekends). I was impressed with the selection for a coffee shop.

As soon as I walked in I was warmly greeted. I placed my order and took a seat while I waited for my lunch to be prepared. My order took a moment, but was worth the wait. While I waited I noted that this was one of the cleanest shops I've visited. That is always a good thing when ordering food.

The Pistachio Delight drink was the main thing that lured me to this spot and didn't disappoint. Yum! It definitely had the rich pistachio flavor I was seeking. My lunch choice, It's All About Me was very tasty. The simple flavors came together well. I loved the toasted bread and the melted cheese with the basil flavor. I opted for the salad instead of chips. This was a nice serving of spinach with some fresh raspberries and a light vinaigrette on top. For dessert I chose the Salted Caramel Apple Pie. A third yum for this sweet. It definitely had a homemade taste and hit the spot.

As I was finishing my lunch I was asked if everything was good and if I needed anything else. I thought it was nice that they continue to check on customers. At this point I asked if my Pistachio Delight could be transferred to a to go container and they gladly handled that request.

I was the only customer in the establishment and three of the employees were sitting down and looked like they were eating.

When asked if they had sugar free syrups he at first didn't know and then confirmed that they did not (bummer) but offered Agave instead. I then ordered a black coffee and latte and it took quite a while to receive my order considering I was the only person in there. I found that there prices were quite high as well (compared to nearby competition). It seemed like the staff was unfamiliar with working the computer but I tried to let that go considering it was the first week of their grand opening.

I love the location across from Sunset Park, the space is very bright and open. The staff are friendly and the owner has a great rapport with her team. Good music and vibe overall. 

Now the tasty stuff. Their cold brew is excellent, Deborah the owner explained how they prepare the brew to get the great rich flavor. I am also a fan of their Crimson Berry Fruit iced tea w a splash of sparkling water. I'd come down here in the dead heat of summer for that delicious iced tea. 

I tried their rich chocolate brownie, decadent. The pumpkin muffin light, moist and fluffy, and I'm a big fan of their macaroons. I wasn't even big on macaroons before. They're light, tasty, rich and creamy. 

I've also tried their Apple Cheddar and Breakfast Bombness. The Apple Cheddar is yummy. Toasted bread, apple slices, fig jam, melted cheese? Um. Hello, delicious. Finally, the Breakfast Bombness is a flavor trip, avocado, tomato, bacon, cream cheese, spinach - the flavors melted together and the bacon gives it a savory kick, all in an English muffin. Loved it. 

The construction is a bit of a pain (for everyone customers and business owners in the area, there's so much all over LV), but I got my rhythm. Going South on S Eastern, cross Sunset, Pama Lane and right after that is the entrance to Pour. 

I used to live in Las Vegas, for two years. At the time I'd go to Sunrise. When I came across Pour this week I was struck by the brightness of the place and the big windows overlooking the park.

I hate driving through construction, fortunately it lead me to this great little coffeehouse. 
Pour serves up scrumptious sandwiches, desserts, and coffee so well brewed I'll be coming back for more.

A unique selection of specialty lattes, iced and blended drinks. The one that stood out for me was the Macadamia Nut Latte. It wasn't too sweet and it had a roasted nutty flavor.

They only serve paninis / grill sandwiches from 8am to 2pm, so if you can make the time try some of these. Fear not if you can't, they still offer sandwiches after 2pm that doesn't require grilling. On weekends only, the 4 waffle sampler is a must try. I tried to convince them to serve it all week but I guess it would lose it's appeal, so that didn't work.  

The most popular is Breakfast Bombness which consists of tomato, avocado, spinach, bacon, cream cheese on warm, toasted buttered English muffin. This is a delicious sandwich to eat any part of the day, especially breakfast.  Don't be scared to try the Apple Cheddar Turkey Panini, the flavors goes along the similar path as the Bobbi from Caps.

Pour also has an assortment of desserts that they receive from The Baking Cup, a wholesome bakery all the way in Summerlin. I've heard of them through various other bakeries around town so I know they have a solid reputation. Since it's not always convenient for me to drive all the there, I'll stick to going to Pour to satisfy my sweet tooth. The brownies and cookies are my weakness.

I know, I know, there are tons but after trying a good 2-3 of them, I get tired of looking for more. I'm not a huge coffee drinker so I'm not that persistent in trying to find the place. However, I think I've found a place that I could go to if I ever need coffee. Pour. 

Saw this on yelp, got decent reviews, and decided why the heck not? I had a little bit of time to kill before work so lets give this a try and I'm so glad I did. 

The barista that was there the morning I went was very very helpful. I forgot her name but she's the one that's allergic to bread! I told her what I liked and what I didn't like. I do not like acidic coffee. I prefer something smooth and fragrant. I do not like diabetes in a cup so I prefer something that's not too sweet. 

I ended up choosing the macadamia nut latte and I have to say that it's really smooth. It isn't acidic at all which is PERFECT! They don't use an acidic coffee base! Yayy!! It was just really delicious!  It was a bit on the sweeter side but it's nothing that I can't handle. It didn't punch me in the face. I think that when I go next time, I'll probably get just an iced coffee or get another macadamia nut latte but lessen the sweetness. 

Definitely coming back and definitely recommend people to give them a try.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,3,4,nT-3u0YPNMhIY1Woc7k-7A
5389210,2016-01-09,4,kDCyqlYcstqnoqnfBRS5Og,"Because I am a small business owner, it is the VERY REASON I came to this particular establishment!  I love, love, loooooove new coffee AND tea shops! In fact, I prefer them over chains and am happy to be a frequent and generous patron. 

What I do not expect is to be blatantly disregarded and spoken to poorly by the owner, ""Deborah A""!  

There are so many coffee aficionados out there, why does it seem so odd that there are tea aficionados as well?   Considering I Yelp'd for ""tea"" (not ""coffee & tea"") and this establishment popped up, I had the expectation of a selection of teas.  When offered only six varieties, none of them a basic black tea, from my point of view this establishment's TEA (not coffee) selection ~was~ ""minuscule and sad.""    

I'm seriously not sure how arguing with a customer is beneficial.  All it would take is a bit more customer service, and a bit more research in improving one's tea selection.",zlo2SXZBwhbx6JlsVHme5Q,4,0,1,KL_xanBTPbP38vLHgdsbQg

5657275,2015-11-21,0,kDCyqlYcstqnoqnfBRS5Og,"3 stars for me means I liked it. There is room for improvement. 

TL:DR version:

The coffee tastes good...but they messed up our coffee orders and one of the food orders.

Overall it was a good experience if you can forgive their mistakes because they are new.

Considering what you get at elsewhere in the area(Sunrise, mothership, and grouchy Johns are my norm)... They cost the same but you get less food for it. Coffee prices are normal. 

--------------------------------

Detailed version:

We ordered 2 coffees and 2 sandwiches.

Mistake #1) Ordered ""large decaf coffee with a little room for cream.""
What I got was a coffee with creamer added for me. They put in way more creamer than I normally take. 

Fix: Let customers add their own cream. I would have felt like a schmuck for asking them to dump their coffee so I could fix it the way I like, so didn't.

Mistake #2) Hubbie ordered a large house drip decaf. What he got was a coffee with cream. He drinks it black. 

Fix: Don't add cream for customers. Here are 2 mistakes on our first time visit. Because of their awesome competition in the area we kind of expect coffee houses to get coffee down right off the bat. Again ...hate waste so he drank it.

Mistake #3 we ordered 2 sandwiches. Hubbie did not want his chips. I ordered breakfast bombness with a fruit cup. I think it's called that. It's the first sandwich on the panini menu. What I got was a sandwich without a fruit cup...because they never entered it into the order.  If it's supposed to have chips as a default, then I did not get chips. I also expected a sandwich packed full of tomato slices, avocado, spinach... Etc etc. Very skimpy on filling. Very flat sandwich. Small. Tasty but small. I could taste the avocado and bacon but if the other ingredients were there, it just got lost. It's just a simple proportion problem. But if this is how the sandwich is supposed to be, then I'm just not a fan of their sandwich style.

Fix:   this is probably an issue of new staff unfamiliar or not completely comfortable with the payment system yet and punching up the order. The impression I got was they were half listening and half focused on entering the order. This issue will likely go away as staff is more familiar and experienced.

What it boils down to is, their competition is still better. It's not enough for ME to include them into our list of regular hang outs yet. But maybe once they are settled in a bit more. 

We're willing to give a second chance.",Ewkl5dlHM_s_N0Fkb47Rzw,2,1,3,FDAv3VTQcs4kUuTcjcfBpA

They host small groups for community events and meetings so it's a great place to network within the community as well. The chai tea latte in my opinion is one of the best in the area by far! They make an exceptional latte and the Togo cups are awesome to run out on the road with. Certainly a must try",n07_7NVp-V-cHBABNhOX5A,1,1,5,xhSh5a0CXuemJ4KKJUJPjQ

Loved the coffee drinks. Got a regular latte and also a white chocolate latte. Both drinks were very good in my opinion, but of course I'm no coffee bean expert. All I can say is though I very much prefer it over most other places including the large corporate chains. Pastries are offered here also, and had items that catered to those who are in a vegan diet. 

It's still a new place, so I'm sure they will be further enhancing the decor inside. Looked a little plain, but did have quite a number of seats. Hopefully things pick up here and they can make the insides a little cozier.",7HfB-_decLkQCC8yC5glag,2,1,4,_VsYvX7xrES6KTJJfN1xTQ
