137459,2015-06-07,0,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,How can it continue to get worse month after month. Having gone here for ages you can tell things have changed cook wise. The seafood can go from great to rancid tasting in the same week. Why?  The new menu has scallops that are truly dreadful. It takes someone that eats scallops to cook them right I think. Crab stack has more mayonnaise and seasoning to cover any hint of crab flavor.  And still steaks 2 out of 3 times we've ordered have been not slightly but very over cooked and dry. I'm not a big fan of the Mexican restaurant next door but go there now for a steak instead when we stay at SAMs.  Think I'll try the standard TGIFridays food next time.  Probably more consistent anyway.  Too bad. Was once a great place to dine.,mORJkM6nY6YFaS_v4G8RFw,0,0,2,b9afnWKHYEePIPvQX9lqBg

Starting with the spinach salad having slimy leaves, not wilted from the dressing.  This was replaced with haste from the Mgr who wanted to argue that we didn't know what a hot dressing  over spinach salad should look like.  Wilted is one thing, slimy leaves after date is another.  The salmon did not come seasoned as described, the shrimp scampi was vermicelli and shrimp, not sauteed garlic in sauce.  Maybe the chef had an off night?  $175 tab, and less than stellar food with rude Mgr?  Don't waste your time.",Oga7Sku1VnL4aYxPBHVZMQ,0,0,1,vBcao5WD4tFeCITpx40zAQ

Let me say it was not as pleasant as I had remembered. The waiter who brings the drinks stood over me passing..let me re phase that he was slamming down the drinks for 6 of us standing next to me the entire time. It felt like I was in his way. It took asking three times to get a refill for my husbands diet coke. We got plenty of water refills but the guy just couldn't remember that diet coke. Then the food waiter wasn't so friendly. My mother in laws steak was supposed to be well done and it had plenty of red in it and she doesn't like to make a fuss so she ate around it and when waited asked how our food was she said well my steak wasn't well but I did eat around it. He never apologized or offered to take it back or even tried to make it right. He could care less. I don't really know why he even bothered to ask that question. Out of habit I guess. At the end of the meal he brought our check and smiled. Wow smiling at the beginning of the experience would have went alot farther for me. The steaks where not very good and we all decided that we wouldn't be coming back to Billy Bobs, sad because my husbands family use to come there alot for birthdays and graduations and special events.

We had made an early reservation(445pm)  over a week in advance, since 6pm was already taken. We were seated on time and the restaurant was only 1/3 full. Our server was nice and came by to get drink orders. Then we waited a long time to order our meal.  When she finally came back to take our order, she apologized and said she thought we had a larger party.  We had 4 adults and one toddler.  We placed our order and  were served our soups quickly. The soups were good.  2 of us ordered Steak Dinners and 2 ordered the holiday Turkey Dinner.  The turkey dinners were good.  However, the steaks were both over cooked!  I ordered Medium and it was well done. My MIL ordered Medium Rare and it came out medium well to well.  It took a long time to get our meals.  We asked the server for the Manager.  The Manager finally came by the table.  He was a tall heavy set man who towered over the table and made us feel small.  His bottom button on his short sleeved shirt was unbuttoned.  We told him that our 2 steaks were over cooked, but that the yams were yummy ( best part of the meal.). He proceeded to say: "" cut into the middle, maybe that's cooked right"".  As if to say, we, as the customers were wrong.  We said it was well over cooked and we did not like it.  He only said Sorry, and offered nothing... No discount, no dessert, nothing.  Just sorry.  Sadly, we will not return and will be letting all our friends to stay away.  Did Management change here?  My MIL said it used to be good a few years back.  The manager was very  unkept and not nice at all.  We will look elsewhere for better food and hospitality.  I' d expect more from Management.

532820,2012-02-13,1,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"The steaks here are really good. Not quite the quality as a lot of other steakhouses in town. For the price it can't be beat though. The pork chops are some of the best I have ever had. They are properly cooked and are a very thick cut. Plus you get two of them. You just might have to take one home when you can't finish both. If you only got the pork chops you might be able to eat both, but you also get a salad and one side. The sides are very large. Especially the baked potato. That could be a meal in itself. And speaking of the salad, it is very, very good. They have a mixture of iceberg, mixed greens, onions, olives and croutons. And the dressing is put on the side allowing you to decide how much goes on. They also put out a nice bread basket with several types to choose from.

The service is always the best here. They are very attentive to all the patrons needs. When they get very busy service can be a bit slow sometimes, but they still do pretty good.

The decor has some needed work. It looks like the design was selected in the sixties and never redesigned. It feels like you are eating in a barn or a mine shaft depending where you sit. A bit of a more modern take might make the ambiance more appealing.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,4,2,4,apWs5cqnTIFFbHrCumKIOA
616860,2012-12-09,0,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"Friday night, no reservations, quoted a wait time of 20 minutes....not bad.  Until we were seated that is.  The place was next to empty, not exactly sure why we had to wait 20 minutes for a table as there were plenty empty tables that were visible.  
Our waiter approached the table, engaged in a little conversation, and even complimented our children.  He was great, until the larger party sat next to us(8+ people).  Salads came out (these were probably the best part of the dinner, but you could probably get the same quality at apple-bee's)  Once our entrees came out, the kids chicken was rubber-like (not worth $15.00 a plate).  My husband and I both ordered steak (ordered medium, presented well done, no pink and completely dry) with a side of shrimp (4 overcooked pieces of shrimp for $11, YUCK!)  Our waiter was so focused on the larger party, he only acknowledged us in passing.  This made it nearly impossible to inform him of how dissatisfied with our food we were.  When our plates were cleared, the waiter asked if I wanted a box, I said no thank you, the dinner was not good at all.  He cleared the plates and left.  Another gentleman who had taken our drink order came back to ask if I wanted a refill on soda, I said yes.  Unfortunately, he never returned with my drink.  The waiter put our bill on the table, and took it back in passing, before I was ready to acknowledge the amount of $115.  

He was not interested at all in hearing what we had to say. I wrote on the back of the order slip all of the issues we had and handed it directly to the manager that was at the door, and proceeded to stand right outside Billy Bob's to watch the mystic waterfall show.

The manager did call me the next day.  I wish I could say he handled the situation the best he could; however, that was not the case.  He said he spoke with the waiter (who stated he was unaware of any issues).  He also stated that had I informed him of the problem earlier, he could have made an effort to make an adjustment to our bill.  

Needless to say, this place is a joke.  We just moved to Vegas, and are looking for a good steak joint that is NOT on the strip.  I guess we will continue our search... elsewhere!",PLIU9a5ZFoZfOC_lHVPwwA,4,0,1,vhCTdySmhKZCxa1gIaep5w
651118,2016-03-16,0,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"This is located in Sam's Town Hotel/Casino on Boulder hwy.  I've heard good things about Billy Bobs from my daughter who attends UNLV and also from relatives who frequent the area.  Went there for the 5pm - 6pm early bird special which is prime rib for $12.99.  My wife and I got there right when they opened (5pm) and didn't have to wait at all.  Waiters were extra friendly and attentive, making us feel like regulars even though it was our first time here.  The ambience was cozy and comfortable, maintaining that ""ol' west"" feel which is throughout the casino.

As for the food:  I got my prime rib med/rare with sweet potato as my starch.  The piece was perfectly med/rare and fairly lean.  It was soft and flavorful.  The sweet potato was huge, soft, and delicious also.  I was a happy camper.
The wifey got the 1/2 rack bbq ribs with a baked potato for $18.00.  The meat was soft and the sauce was ""on the sweet side.""  She did say that the sauce could have been warmer.  Nonetheless, she was satisfied with her meal (And if mama's happy, I'm happy).
The dinner salad was a bit disappointing being that they used iceberg lettuce.  I did not expect that from a restaurant of this caliber.

For a restaurant with up-scale prices to throw some bagged iceberg lettuce, a few cucumber sluces and grape tomatoes on a plate and call it a salad was disappointing to say the least.
The soup was delicious, the steak medalions so tender and the mushroom gravy very savory. The steak was served atop asparagus and  a few wilted microgreens. They should switch them and use them in the salads instead.

My wife always orders the blackened ribeye. I think she's trying to figure out who in Vegas has the best ribeye. So far T-Bone's Chophouse holds that title.

Guys, if you've never taken your girl out to a really nice restaurant to eat and you think Olive Garden is upscale, try this place out. Its a guaranteed step up and will earn you a bunch of cool points.

The waitress did take a while to get our drinks. Our drinks didn't arrive until after our salads came out. Then she forgot one persons drink in our party. He had to remind her to get his drink.

The food was great as always but the service this time was lackluster and quite obnoxious to say the least. It was 4th of July weekend so the restaurant was more packed than my previous times here. My server was ""Maverick"" (really?), an older gentleman with an obviously fake Old Western stage name. He tried to tell my friends and I bad jokes the few times we saw him and kept loudly laughing at himself and also tried to hard sell us about 3 times into buying some ""funnel cake fries"" when we kept saying we were not interested! It took him 20 minutes to bring our initial drinks and another 20 to come back and even take our order! The food was great when it finally arrived but he then never checked on us again until we got the check. We have never before had such a poor experience at this place so I am chalking it up to (hopefully) the crazy busy holiday weekend. When I return I will make sure it is not a holiday and hopefully I will get a different server!",q_d9OQfa-t1yeDFDxOsh6A,1,0,3,QdJoW6TVsXjIvoeQsOr8ew
2167815,2015-03-16,1,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"We ate dinner here twice, and I'd give it 3.5 stars. The 20-ounce bone-in prime rib was supposed to be medium rare the first night and came out medium well, but it tasted good. The second night was much better. Our server on the first night was great, helpful and friendly. The server on the second night was mediocre, and took very long to bring everything, including the drinks. 

The king crab legs on the first night were good, better than the second night. Somehow the crab legs in the appetizer were served cold and tasted like they were split open before they were cut, since they had zero taste. The ones that came as a side dish were warm and tasty but a little salty. The clam chowder was delicious. The lobster bisque and French onion soup were okay, although there was a little tool much Pernod in the bisque. I guess that's how they serve it in Vegas?

Overall I can't complain, since we were treated to dinner by my cousin and her husband. Thank you for a nice dinner and great company!",5wpIPy6Ce4hyyymEJjjT1Q,1,1,3,6le0t8WwPDoPaLYwiqptIg

2354484,2011-05-08,0,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"So date night was upon us and my better half had a hankering for steak. Courtesy of the Yelp Iphone application, good ol' Billy Bob's inside of Sam's Town popped up. 

Nestled in the Sam's Town ""forest"" near the indoor waterfall and light show, we arrived at Billy Bobs. 

The hostess politely ended her personal phone call to find out whether we preferred a booth or table then proceeded to escort us to our seats. 

I couldn't tell you our server's name if that is any indication as to the level of spectacular service we received last night, but luckily the tasty eats balanced out the lack of charisma from our wait staff. 

House salad with ""Italian"" dressing was actually quite tasty! But for the record they may want to just refer to it as a balsamic dressing..either way it was delicious. 

I ordered the breaded chicken with lemon caper sauce and what protein wouldn't be complete without a carb to accompany it? Garlic mashed it is! The chicken was tender and not dry at all and the lemon caper sauce added a fantastic pizazz to the dish. Garlic mashed potatoes were nothing out of the ordinary, not over powering in the garlic department and I didn't need to add salt so that's always a plus in my book. 

Partner in crime ordered a fillet and though it was a little over cooked around the edges, the ""medium"" cooked portion of the meat was pretty tasty. I wouldn't say this entree was above and beyond in any way shape or form, but it was good for the price. 

Since I enjoy consumer research in the eating department we decided to quality control the desert menu. Cheese cake ""dejour"", which ended up being plain cheesecake with strawberry topping on it was delicious. I'm pretty certain their ""dejour"" is the same every night, but I could be mistaken, haha. 

In any event, if you are looking for an off-strip, casual steak house experience, I would recommend Billy Bob's inside of Sam's Town. 

If you're looking for flashy bells and whistles, stellar service and taste explosions, might want to investigate other options. This joint is great for a low-key evening with out the muss of having to get all gussied up.",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,3,2,4,X22AcJR1Jha1jEoyAArehg

2697612,2015-10-03,0,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"Let me first say that I've been coming to Billy Bob's ever since they opened...many many many years ago!  My last visit on 9/23/15 apprx. 5:15 pm was HORRIFIC!  We made resv. for a booth for 2 people.  When we arrived.....they did not have our reservation!  Told me that they can seat us at a table because the booth's were already reserved for reservations.  I said... ""We have a reservation at 5:15 pm for a Booth!""  She continued to say she didn't see our resv. & if we wanted a booth we'd have to wait an hour!  I said forget it...we'll just sit at a table because I'm not waiting an hour! 
Already I was irritated by their incompetence.  My mother and I had a server named Margaret.  She seemed to not really want to be very attentive.  We already knew what we wanted....because we get the same thing everytime we eat here.  King cut prime rib bone-in for $31 each.  We both had the exact order.....Medium rare....baked potato.....blue cheese on salad and 2 diet soda's.  Pretty simple....so we thought.  Our server Margaret brings out our salads.  These were the most pathetic looking salads ever!  Lettuce was warm and wilted...black olives were spoiled and there was hardly any dressing on it & it was on a little side plate.  So far things aren't going well.  We waited to see Margaret again to ask for a FRESH SALAD....but she disappeared!  After about 20 minutes she showed up with our dinner!  And let me tell you....this Prime Rib was absolutely HORRIBLE LOOKING & EVEN MORE HORRIBLE TASTING!  It was gray in color....NOT MEDIUM RARE AT ALL.....it was so TOUGH you couldn't even chew it!!!!!  I am not exaggerating either!  I was so disappointed...I seriously couldn't believe my eyes!  This so called prime rib looked like it was microwaved!!!  I was stunned!!!!  We've eaten this prime rib at least 300 times!  I don't know who was cooking but this prime rib was OLD & DEFINIETLY NOT FRESH!  I can't believe they actually tried to serve something like that for $31!  I wouldn't want to pay $5.95 for it let alone $31!!!
So....here we go again....Where's Margaret?????  Can't find her.....so we will eat our potato until we do.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes we asked the busboy to find our server.  Here she finally comes!  We explained to her that this prime rib is NOT MEDIUM RARE....IT'S WELL DONE & MICROWAVED!  And you can't even chew it!  She said....""Yes it doesn't look right does it?""  We so no....please get us a manager.  Well after another 10 minutes here comes this woman who was the restaurant manager.....we explained to her and she looked at the prime rib and agreed that it DOES NOT LOOK RIGHT.....in ""her words""!  She said let me go see what I can find out.  Now we're done with our potato....looking at this inedible meat on our plate......waiting....and waiting.  Here comes Margaret again...she said ""Has she fixed your order?""  We said no.....as it sits on our plate still.  She said......the manager should be back soon.  Finally here the manager comes....she says...""I was able to take $10 off your check!""  I ABOUT FLIPPED OUT!!!!!  After all that....she didn't even offer to get us another slice of prime rib?!!!!!!!  Are you kidding me?  WOW!!!!!!  I was so insulted by her response...or lack there of....I could hardly see straight!!!!  She immediately walked away from the table after laying the check folder down with our bill inside on the table.   
I can't believe how unprofessional this entire experience was and how horrible the food was.  I don't know what happened to this place.....but CLEARLY something has changed here!  And the fact that a manager wasn't capable of correcting the disgusting meal with something edible....stuns me even more. 
I think it's time to contact the Food & Beverage Manager.  This was nothing short of robbery!  The gamble shouldn't be on your meal!  That's what the slot machines are for!  When I'm paying hard earned money for a meal....I expect to get what I paid for!

At that price point, better server training and management is needed. Customer service as well as drink availability and food presentation are the key to success.",w1067WINTdRWH-VQ2ju-_A,0,0,2,yEZJ2ozazzT0VhG-4tJzUw

It started out great we were seated giving our menus. We were looking over them. Everyone was ready to order there, selected item on the menu. My fiance asked the older gentleman who was our busser to grab the waiter/ waitress 4 times. We sat there and waited quite a long time. The busser brings our drinks to the table gets everything right but mine. Our waitress comes to the table ""finally."" (Attitude from ""the get go."") Blonde short curly hair older woman totally rude!!!!! This was my 1st time here, and it was for my birthday. What a nightmare she ruined my birthday. As I started eating my food that comes. I asked her kindly. ""What the sauce was in the canister."" I've never ate here before? She told me. I asked her again nicely for something else like ranch. Then I think she got offended. She was very rude after, our friends who went with us, asked for an extra plate. She lost it in a rude voice saying ""WAIT A MINUTE IM NOT DONE."" Rudely puts another plate on the table.... I was shocked. That a person so rude could possibly work at this very nice establishment. I sat there for around 15 mins holding my Tounge till I snapped. I went up to a different waiter, and asked for a manager. I was so angry borderline crying tears. The manger came out, and I talked to him outside because I did not want to create a scene. He said, ""He was sorry that he would talk to this very rude employee."" I thought he would remove some items from the check. I asked him to please get me another waitress. He said, ""He would."" 3 other people came to our table. They were nice, we asked several times for the check in fact our friends, and my man wanted to walk out. It was taking forever for our check to come. If I could say anything good about this place. ""It has amazingly great food."" We got our check finally from Toni I'm assuming the manager. ""THE WAITRESS FROM HELL,"" name was not on our check. I saw the manager removed one item from the check. (My personal opinion, I think the meal should have been comped. ""THE WAITRESS FROM HELL."" Should have been told to go home.)

My husband went with the Salmon filet and baked yams, while I ordered the bone in pork chop.

My husband enjoyed the salmon, it was moist.

I enjoyed the pork chop, had it cooked medium and it was moist.  (thank you to Ivan at Alder & Birch for telling me a new way to have pork chops)

Desert is always amazing at Billy Bob's. This time around we had the Death by Chocolate with coffee.

4579439,2015-06-17,3,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"Over the years, I've eaten at Billy Bob's 20 or 25 times.  It's close to my house, offers great food without being overly fancy, and has always had good service.  The last 2 times we were there, we were disappointed with our overall experiences, but not disappointed enough to complain about it.  It was just ""meh.""

Tonight we decided to try it again, and it will be the last time.  I will not be back.  We started with breads, and I asked the busboy if he could get me some butter that was softened, because I could not get my knife through the frozen butter in front of me to spread it on my bread.  He said, ""no problem"" and that's the last I saw him until he dropped desserts on our table an hour later.  

We ordered salads.  We both requested that the salads be tossed, and again, we were told, ""no problem.""  She dropped the salads at our table a bit later, and they were ranch soup with some wilted lettuce and croutons floating in it - they clearly had not been tossed - just drenched in dressing.  Next came the French onion soup, which was burned.  The cheese on top was blackened, and yet the waitress sat it on our table anyway.  I tried.  I really tried to stomach it, but they burned the cheese so bad it burned the onions under it.  It took me 5 tries and almost 15 minutes before I could flag the waitress down and have her replace it.  

When our entrees came, the garlic potatoes were more garlic and salt than they were potatoes, the prime rib was bubble gum chewy, and the vegetables were somehow both wilted and crunchy.  It was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.  

We opted to try dessert as we were both still a little hungry, so we ordered a crème brulée.  I LOVE crème brulée, and Billy Bob has great crème brulée - or at least they did until today.  The brulée was blackened, which created a smoky flavor in the crème, and the texture was more of a pudding than a light airy crème dessert.  It was overcooked by almost double.  

As we were trying to eat the dessert and picking the most offensive of the burned crust from the top, the manager walked by.  ""You are picking off the best part.""  I informed her that we both love brulée, but this one is burned pretty bad and overcooked, and then informed her of the other problems we had with our meal.

Her reply was, ""Oh, that sucks.  I'll have to see who is making them today,"" and then she walked off.  No apology, no offer to replace it, no offer to take it off the bill...nothing.  I understand that mistakes happen in the restaurant industry.  We are all human.  But to be a restaurant manager, be informed by a guest that their meal and dessert were sub-par (in parts inedible), and then just walk off with a ""That sucks?""  Yes.  It does suck.  It sucks to pay $60 or $70 for food that you cannot eat - with service that is worse than Denny's.  It sucks for you that you will not get any more of my business...because despite years of great meals, you are now destroying your reputation, and driving your customers away.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,4,0,1,WmW5uRWj6-MzyzJdH4WRpA
4655194,2015-06-23,8,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"When I think of Billy Bob's Steak House, that 1965 oldie ""5 O' Clock World""  by the Vogues plays in my head. That is because it's a 5 O' clock world when Billy Bob's opens for business in style with an hour long $12.99 prime rib special that ends at 6 o' clock. 

  Billy Bob's $12.99 prime rib special is a nice deal that includes a large serving of prime rib with a choice of potato and salad. With a beverage, tax, and tip; the $12.99 prime rib special adds up to $20. Still a good deal. 

  On a recent visit to Sam's Town, I saw the advertisement for the $12.99 prime rib special. I had to go back to try it. After hiking in Wetlands Park, I treated myself to a post hike dinner at Billy Bob's. 

Service: 

    Throughout the dining experience the waiter was friendly and on top of the Coke refills. Fine service from seating myself to paying the check. 

Ambience: 

   Billy Bob's is a fun restaurant to dine in. My patio seat was in Mystic Falls Park, Sam's Town's Disneyesque park under an atrium reflecting real sunlight where audio autotronic animals entertain the guests. My table would be a nice spot to take in the laser show. And it isn't everyday, where you are enjoying prime rib to look up and see a realistic bear growling as he looks your way at the same time that birds chirp away, and a waterfall cascades into a Disneyesque park. My table was also along the walking path through the perimeter of Mystic Falls Park. Billy Bob's is also a casual restaurant to dine in. The dining room beyond the bar is dimly lit creating a different environment from Mystic Falls Park. 

Prime rib dinner:

    I was satisfied with the prime rib dinner. After hours of hiking, the $12.99 prime rib tasted like a million bucks. The portions were both quality and quantity. This also included the salad. Now the baked potato with both sour cream and butter could of been a meal in itself. Finally the prime rib, as the picture proceeding the review shows, was large, thick, and juicy. Regardless of a few Swiss cheese shaped spots of fat, I'd give the prime rib four stars. 

Return factor:

   Billy Bob's won me over with two things that I enjoy when dining out: delicious food at a fair price and an upbeat dining environment. Mix the upbeat Disneyland environment of Mystic Falls Park with a tasty prime rib special, oh he'll yeah I'm a fan. I cannot guarantee it, but sometime in the future I am leaning toward returning for the steak and shrimp special. Now if I could only get that song ""5 O' Clock World"" out of my head.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,9,4,GLmZtOBQhT36zIYVT7tnBw

We were tired and hungry after our flight into vegas and did not want to venture from the hotel. Our dining experience here made us adventurous, as no way would we trust another restaurant at this hotel/casino, if this is their best restaurant.

So let the dining adventure begin...we are seated promptly, that earned the one and only star for this place. Our table is one of only a few occupied tables in our dining area. We see a couple of people who appear to be taking home their entire meal uneaten into to go containers. We found this curious.

We sat and sat and sat and sat....after 20 minutes a waitress comes. We order a bottle of wine, and although we are ready to order our meal. She leaves without taking our order. 10 minutes later we get a bread basket and inquire about our wine. We are rudely told it is coming. 

I do not know what kind of bread this was supposed to be, but it was nasty! Horrible smelling, horrible tasting. Really tested our gag reflexes to the limit. Like the mother dough went bad but they kept using it. Super gag!

Salad and soup come, still no wine, but of course we are assured it is coming. Honey's salad was major fail, however, my chicken tortilla soup was the highlight of the meal. Of, course there was no edible bread to dunk into said yummy soup. 

At last the wine arrives, hallelujah, praise the lord! But, wait, what is this? Oh no, no, no...it cannot be! They put the st. Michelle's Merlot in a chiller! The server then proceeds to open the bottle and pour full glasses! No simple pour to taste that the wine is not corked. Major faux pas in our part of the world.

So as we try to bring the wine down to a reasonable temperature by cradling the wine glasses with our hands, dinner finally arrives, mind you we are almost at 1.5 hour mark since being seated. Fillet mignon and prime rib, both are chewy and unsatisfying to say the least.

This is one of those places where quantity is more prevalent than quality. More food seems to leave in doggy bags than gets eaten. Service was exceedingly horrible. This was our nightmare vegas dining experience by far. Go anywhere but here!",n3UTCj2kQz9qRwtRkK3O-Q,7,0,1,eR_QuhniER2Vtn5COJTIhw

Since I am relatively new to Yelp as I am writing this review, I'll make this review about tonight's meal.  Now, with that said, I have never had a bum meal here.  Every time I have come here it has been aces.  

So, here is the experience that my family and I had during this visit:

1.  I decided to read some of the previous reviews to see if anything may have changed.  There were some unpleasant reviews and to be honest, it kind of worried me.  But, since this is my sisters favorite place, we decided to give it a try.  

2.  As I was looking at Billy Bob's homepage here on Yelp, I saw a link where I could make a reservation.  So, I decided to trust it and made the click.  About 10 - 15 minutes later there was a confirmation waiting for me in my email.  

3.  We decided to show up a little earlier than the time of our reservation.  I got to the front desk and asked if we could sit a little earlier.  ""No problem... please follow me"".   

4.  Now, I am a clean freak and a bit of a germaphobe.  So, I went  to wash up.  This is where I deduct a star.  The sink area was absolutely soaked and the paper towels were sitting on top.  I have changed many paper towel dispensers and it's not that hard.  So, someone must have dropped the ball here.  

5.  As I came back to the table, the complimentary bread and butter was delivered.  The motto in my family is ""IF IT'S FREE, TAKE 2"".  So needless to say we had 2 servings of the bread.  Now here is my tip ""Don't load up on bread 'cause you'll never finish your meal.""

6.  Our drinks were always fresh... And our waiter (Derrick)  gave us ample amount of time to look at our menus.  He was right there when we were ready.  

7.  Our meals were timed well.  We had our salad's and soup well before our meals came out.  The food came out hot and to order.  We ate as much as we could but still had to get boxes to take home.  He brought the bill after a dessert pitch.

When the bill came, I asked the bartender if he needed to see my players card for the special and he said ""no, we really don't care about that"". Fast forward a few months to today. 

Opentabled a reservation and was seated in seconds. Great start! Walking to be seated, everyone in the place was having the steak and lobster special; must be good. Bus boy takes our drink order, and our server, Debbie, comes over to take our order. Of course she asked what we were drinking since apparently the staff doesn't really communicate with each other.

She finished taking my order and my significant other proceeds to order the same thing. She tells us to pull out individual players cards for the special. Really?

Whatever Debbie, be a company girl. You sold your $35 filet tonight, which is what my SO ordered. 

While waiting, another party sits next to us in Debbie's section and orders the special. Person #3 didn't have their player card on them, so good ole Debbie sends them back to their room to go get it! At least she's consistent?

Food comes. Whoever is throwing the steaks in the oven needs a lesson on how to cook them. Or maybe it's because their ""special"" steak, which is about as thick as a piece of cardboard, cooks in seconds. Either way, I ordered it medium rare and got medium well, pushing on well. Of course the $35 filet comes out perfect medium rare. Irony? Probably not. 

The bus boy came over a few times to refill drinks and clear plates. Debbie made an appearance to try to sell some dessert, which obviously was a no-go. Left quickly and will not be returning.",MQ7BoAs7XWXeuJPmiMa0aw,1,0,1,uItjr2rVWYhitKuaFEBRnQ
5674498,2013-10-23,2,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by Billy Bob's.

We come to Sam's Town every Saturday night to enter our picks for their football contest.  On my way to work every night, I pass a billboard on the 95 that advertises steak and lobster for $11.99.

So, on this particular Saturday night, we decided to stop in for dinner after playing bingo.  I am not sure of the restaurant's hours, but we got there just about 10pm.  We inquired with the hostess about the special and she explained the details:

- guests must be a players club member and present their card before ordering
- guests must purchase a beverage
- guests must be over 21

Since we met all of those criteria, we were quickly sat at a nice table.  The atmosphere overall is nice.  There are tables and booths and a large bar.  Our server was very friendly (I don't recall her name).

Considering this special is $11.99, I wasn't particularly expecting much.  I tend to do this so I don't find myself disappointed.  We were served a basket of bread, and also started with our choice of soup or salad.  I had my salad with bleu cheese, my Dad with ranch, and my Mom had the soup - lobster bisque.  The salads were typical (not in a bad way).  The soup was really good, it had chunks of lobster in it and great flavor.  My Mom was very pleased with it.

With the meal, you also get a choice of side (rice, potato, fries, etc).  Both Mom and Dad had garlic mashed and I had rice pilaf.  We all ordered our steaks medium rare, and mine was done perfectly, but there was definitely some inconsistency with the other 2 (my Dad's was more medium well and my Mom's medium).  Also, this is not the biggest piece of meat you will ever see, but paired with the lobster tail and side, it was plenty of food.

We were all stuffed and my parents admitted that they thought it was too good to be true!  Well, it wasn't - when we got our bill, it was just about $50 for the 3 of us.  They each had coffee and I had a glass of wine - can't beat that!

Note: This special is ONLY available from 8pm-Close.  This is clearly listed on the billboard I saw.  I also would never just sit down at a table to order without having asked in advance.  The hostess was happy to answer any questions we had.  I don't consider this a ""bait and switch."" It's a late night special, offered to players club members.  

I would DEFINITELY go back for this meal again!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,4,4,M7C6XeCjxRi7aij0IXJHtg

It serves good quality steak, but its not a stuffy atmosphere of a high end steak house. I came a bit overdressed the first time and felt like a dumb ass when I saw people in tourist shirts and fanny paks. 
Decent food. A bit high priced, but i DID enjoy my meal. Had no problems with the service. 
I would go again, but I would dress more casual.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,1,0,3,WPg6wRZlUVSs03nGCZp9fw
5796493,2010-09-16,0,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"i had to dock this place one whole star because they are a vegas lifetime away from anything else I can imagine I'd be interested in, but the faux forest at Sam's Town in which Billy Bob's is located is kinda cool in a really odd sort of way (there 's a huge waterfall with a roaring bear. totally NOT weird). In any case, our server was great. Exactly the type of seasoned professional I want serving me at any dining facility, and especially in vegas. The bread basket wasn't outstanding, nor was the salad, but for what we paid, we got a LOT of food and the meat, which is really what we went for, was cooked just right. I split the 24oz porterhouse with my fiance and added a side of asparagus but we also got a mambo  sweet potato, which was our choice over a baked or fries. i think that cost us a whopping total of like less than $30! serio, amazing. and whle the porterhouse didn't blow my mind, my soon-to-be father-in-law (too many dashes..) got the ribeye and WOW. mind blown. seuper taaasty. and the beers are cheap and the sc game was on nearby. everyone won.
though that was the only time the entire trip :( good thing we ate for cheap while we could still pay for food.",oGYEaOv0IEUZ6kU3JFe98A,0,0,4,z-maA9ByAHCNmjKw-iPtBg

For the amount of money you charge for the steak, you could at least put a rub or something on it before you put it on the grill. The lobster was a bit overcooked but not so much it lost its flavor.

We were spending some quality family time at Sam's town and it was time to eat right away. We were able to stroll right in here at 9pm and cozy up in a booth with some tasty salads and prime rib. The salads were fresh and delicious and the prime rib tender and flavorful. It was less expensive than most vegas dining and I really enjoyed that I could roll on in here in casual attire. 

The complimentary bread was also especially tasty. 

My sweetheart did not like the naming of the prime rib cuts as ""queen"" and ""king"". That was kind of sexist. Otherwise we agreed it was pretty awesome.",O2NNe32zlfqIFuTDL5Dyeg,1,0,3,vwB9viRfmpr_yJ7Ty3jCsQ

Tasteless and dry.
No inspiration, no quality, no flavor,, this place sucks from the cold dry stale bread, to the crappy steaks.
Like most everything else at Sams Town,, the food here sucks.
Good service so one extra star.

Go elsewhere,, anywhere, even Outback has this joint beat.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,2,1,2,vu5JRzLrubqd_6YrLCLO8Q

Our last staycation there was our first time actually eating inside. Be fore warned that you need to come hungry. The portions are HUGE. If you are a snacker resist the urge to eat the delicious bread and butter they put out for you (You will thank me later).

As I mentioned the Prime Rib portion was huge, of barely fit on the plate. Its scary but we had ordered the 2nd biggest cut they had. Flavor was top notch on it and she will be happy to order it again. Our other dish was was their seafood pasta. It had fresh and plentyfull seafood I could have eaten it all night. The dish was advertised as spicy but it barely had any bite. I would be happy to order it again asking they kick up the spicy level a bit.

Our server was top notch and always there to bring a fresh drink or offer something different to try.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,4,1,5,U3XV0IRI5gVl39UfKejpnw

5965952,2014-02-16,2,Wlcl0ITWjyhqCiSlPmSAlg,"We went last night for Valentines day and I felt embarrassed for making the arrangements there as the experience was awful. We booked through Open Table over a week prior and was given a confirmation, so you would think that it wouldn't take close to 15 minutes for them to find our reservation when we arrived.

We were then sat in Carlos section. Took awhile for us to be greeted and then My mother in law ordered water with lemon, no lemons were given. But hey no big deal! We all ordered steaks and it comes with a starch and salad. Felt the pricing was good for what's included compared to other steak houses.

Salads arrived, only table not given croutons, but then again, that is not anything to really complain about! Main courses were delivered and waiter said he will stop by in just a few to make sure everything was ok. Well we didn't receive the extra side dishes we ordered, steaks were under seasoned, and over cooked. The waiter, nor anyone else checked by or was in the vicinity to let them know. So we just ate our mediocre food, the waiter finally came by as we were finished to ask if we wanted a box. Also refills on drinks... Forget about it!!

Getting a box was another 10 minute wait, and then getting the check was about another 10 minutes. Of course the check also reflected all the food we never received. The bill was corrected though and we then left.

Being that I have been in the service industry for many years, I can honestly say that I can tolerate a lot of errors or oversight by wait staff or kitchen as places can get busy. Not one aspect of this dinner was acceptable and the server didn't even seem that busy with other tables. 

Really sad about this as the restaurant has great potential.",nGYWMsfUofP3cWmzuW8fWw,6,1,1,GWQ0ZxJJVR9UZudFzMN7ZQ
