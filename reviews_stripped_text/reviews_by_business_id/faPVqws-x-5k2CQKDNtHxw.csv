I ended up ordering the blue plate special and some cornbread for the appetizer. Cornbread was very yummy -- I love the little bits of jalapeño inside! The chicken was very juicy, crispy, not greasy or oily, and surprisingly not heavy, if that makes any sense. The biscuit was pleasantly crunchy, but not overly so. I was expecting the biscuit to be fairly dry like any other biscuit but it was not! Quite refreshing.

Everything on the plate goes really well together, including the hot sauce! Sounds weird but the watermelon tastes really good dipped in the hot sauce haha. Will definitely be back!",qrTVWMqSafe5X8FJYE1eqg,0,0,4,6wVB8nnllNu1b62UBhZEsw

I was especially excited to find gluten free fried chicken made with a rice batter. Usually gluten free fried foods use corn batter which I cannot tolerate either. My non gluten free friend also loved the chicken which is a testament to how good it was.

The chicken is not as nearly impressive as it looks. It is NOT crispy, rather the skin is falling off with an almost too soft light texture. So you never really get that awesome and satisfying crunch when you think of great fried chicken. The concept was ideal but they didn't pull it off. 

The best dish was the Short Rib $32 14 oz. bone in short rib, charred corn, green beans sweet garlic bordelaise, cauliflower mashed potatoes. Expect a small portion of this with over-powering flavors of lingering oils! 

House Fries were yummy and yummy!

Mac n Cheese, well texture and flavor nice but a little sweet for my palate.

There was an altercation near the entrance and he handled it calmly and professionally. I was really impressed.

And the food...OMG. There was so much of it! It's family-style portions but we each ordered something individually and split it. The biscuits were maybe the best part of the meal. They have a great cocktail list and bourbon selection if that's your thing.

58751,2017-11-25,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Love this restaurant. As a southerner living in Las Vegas, it is nice having a place to get warm biscuits, endless sweet tea and fried green tomatoes. I brought two friends for Thanksgiving lunch and we enjoyed every bit of it. We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and the hostess was really accommodating, telling us to let her know when we were ready to take the table. We started out our afternoon at the bar where Amanda, who was really sweet and made us some great drinks, and gave us good food recommendations.  Lizzette (Lizetta?) was our waitress and she was amazing. Really friendly, very knowledgeable and got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal in addition to providing fresh cutlery and plates for our main courses. We shared the biscuits, fried okra, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes, collard greens deviled eggs, shrimp and grits and a turkey dinner, which came with cauliflower mash and mac and cheese. Everything was delicious, although it would have been nice for the turkey dinner to have come with a little bit more (more meat (the slices were tiny), more gravy, green beans, more cranberry sauce, maybe a couple more biscuits, it was a $32 plate and seemed a bit bare for the price). All in all, we enjoyed our meal and Lizette(ta?) packed up all of our leftovers for us, even splitting some items for us to take separately from each other. I also took a piece of the bourbon pecan pie as a late night snack for later and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very nice. It is quietly busy, if that makes sense, and the tables are nicely spread out so you don't feel as if you are BFF with the table beside you. I love the entire layout of this restaurant. I will be leaving the country for the majority of 2018 and I know the first place I will want to eat when I return will be Yardbird!

My husband and I split the chicken biscuits with pepper jelly and each order a mac-n-cheese crock. The biscuits were underwhelming. If you're from the south and you have had a Bojangles Cajun Filet Biscuit, that is better than these biscuits.  The fry on the chicken is light, which is nice but it's no seasoned very well. BUT- the mac-n-cheese!!!  So delish!  It's rich, gooey and worth the trip alone.  I highly recommend. 

The portions are a good size. Many people were eating their signature dish of chicken and waffles and watermelon but that does not appeal as so many places have this these days. Plus it's comes with 4 pieces of fried chicken which is way too much.

Went with a group of 4 friends and we order several items to share family-style:

1. Deviled egg appetizer:  YUM!! Very unique and absolutely delicious. 
2. Biscuits appetizer: excellent! One of our friends grew up in the south and he even said these biscuits were just as good as his grandmas home made biscuits from scratch.
3. Fried chicken and waffles: just order it and find out for yourself how good this is. Words can't do it justice to describe how good both the chicken and the waffles are.
4. Side order of fried chicken: yes, it's that good
5.  Mac and cheese: sooooo good! Plus we had them add bacon ... wow!!!
6. Swine burger: very good, but was outshines by the 5 items listed above.

Unexpectedly, we were hosted in a private room to the side of the main dining room - I would guess it can accommodate 20 guests; a really classy space where the music can be turned down, affording easy conversation.

Our head server (and I apologize profusely for not remembering her name) was very professional, engaged and helpful, making great recommendations for appetizers. We all thoroughly enjoyed these with cocktails; the BLT (green tomato) was a standout. Also enjoyed the deviled eggs. Frankly, the servings were very generous and when it came to the main course a few hungry folks ordered while the rest chose to share a few things. Short ribs - among the best I have ever had!. Shrimps and grits - also A+. Honestly, for the money, in Vegas (really, anywhere metropolitan) this is a no brainer. Superb service, great beverages, not one single dish that we regretted ordering.

I asked to speak with the manager simply to pass on my thanks - he was very humble and professional; I'd come back in a heartbeat.

Even if you can't get the private room I'd recommend dining here, but be aware that the ambiance and noise level in the main dining room is lively - conversation for a party of 4-6 or less would be OK, more than that you'd want the private room.,,, and Kudos to the Yardbird team for recognizing this and putting us in the private room.

The chicken sandwich that they are supposed to be famous for, was just awful.  The meat was thigh, which they would try to tell you is juicier....yeah its also CHEAPER.  The sandwich was wet and chewy.  In fact i hd to check it a few times, just to make sure it was cooked.  It had a faint taste of curry or ginger, im not sure.  That sandwich was GROSS.

some kind of grilled chicken salad - good if you want something lighter. 

If you get biscuits (which you should), ask for the apple butter and whatever other butter they get and put it on your biscuit regardless of how health conscience you are, they are amazing additions to the biscuits.

They'd be better off serving only fried chicken to go. I ordered ahi waitress said seared rare and excellent. Perfect right?  Nope well done cooked through and tough. My advice is pass on this place.

The people at the restaurant are as amazing as their food. The service is impeccable (I mean your water will never be empty and if it is they apologize). Not only does management come by and say hi but the wait staff continually checks on you and not in the annoying way. If you pay attention you will see them float by and take a look at your table and will only stop and talk if it looks like you need something. 

Back to the food. We went there for breakfast and I got the chef special. It was their home made biscuits covered in gravy, a fried chicken thigh, bacon and egg. It was crazy delicious. My wife got the quiche. She said it was great. 

Because breakfast was so good my wife and I decided to give their supper menu a shot. She was apprehensive about it because she wasn't feeling it at the moment. We started with their biscuits appetizer. It comes with a homemade seasonal jam (it was apple) and a honey butter. The whole thing combined was great. She was sold. 

She got their short rib dinner and I again got the chef special. Her short rib was ridiculous.  It fell apart at the touch and was covered in this sauce that was to die for. Not only was the rib and sauce delicious it was stacked on top of a mound of mashed cauliflower. That was also scrumptious. 

Now to my meal. I was so impressed with breakfast I put my trust in the chef again. Now I don't know what they called it and I am sure I will not do it justice but here we go: it was andouille sausage, grilled corn on the cob, shrimp, potatoes, grilled lemon and grilled bread all thrown together in this amazing broth that had just the right amount of spice. I about died. Everything was just right. The spice just sat there in my mouth not overly hot and with just the right amount of flavor. The bread, lemon and potatoes were grilled just right to give the right flavor and the shrimp and sausage were awesome.  

The dinner was so great I had to hug the chef. And I did when I saw him. He was a great person too. You could see he truly wanted to know our thoughts on the food and was sincere about his creation when he spoke about it. 

I will only get to eat here every couple of years. And it will be a must every time. From the food to the people who work there this restaurant is by far my favorite in Vegas. And I have eaten at quite a few. It's the main reason we go.",AFJy5NNXATJqNvsMbODa5Q,0,0,5,obHtOclMguc6rxnGnkj8PQ

Southern food is usually cheap or reasonable.  I didn't expect the prices to be as high as they are. However, I don't mind paying for quality food. I ordered the chicken and waffles ($36) shrimp and grits ($28) , and Mac n cheese ($10) for an appetizer . As soon as the server walked away from the table the Mac n cheese came out within 5 minutes . I thought to myself hmm that's kinda quick, but didn't mind it because it's Mac n cheese and maybe it's pre- prepared given its a side. So I began to eat the Mac n cheese which wasn't to bad, but wasn't anything special and holy cow the chicken n waffles is being served (approx 5minutes) . Now I'm concerned because fried chicken cooked to order should take longer. As expected the chicken was lukewarm as if it had been sitting under a warmer. The chicken was cool to touch and was soggy. I tasted the chicken and the chicken was very very average and to top it off wasn't fresh. The waffle was dry and had a bourbon inside. Terrible terrible mix. Approx 10 minutes later the shrimp n grits arrived . The grits were under cooked and hard and had no flavor like it it was nothing like southern style grits . The total bill came out to $86.00 . I wasn't pleased at all given the price of the food and quality. I will never go back. Eat there at your own risk!",C-H6jfov6Q5QBFBN0V8QvA,0,0,2,xihzlACIdFWswku0DORS9g

The staff, ALL that we encountered, were outstanding as we were rushing to head to the airport and the service was super efficient, warm and friendly.

Everything we ate was delicious and after 3 days in Vegas it was our best meal and our least expensive. 

We didn't have the chicken but it looked fantastic. We had quiche and eggs and bacon hash and a salted caramel bread pudding, which really ought to be subject to them requiring a license to serve. It was spectacular.

They were out of the Crab Benedict so opted for this in place.  The eggs had a very strange texture.  We couldn't tell if they were poached and then broiled giving them a thin plastic appearance, or they created some other magic way of making eggs.... but it was strange.

For drinks I tried the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade and my husband had the Gunshot (Dry Irish Stout).  My preferred drink was the Black Mountain (dark lager).  I really liked the casual ambiance and décor and the friendly staff.  The Deviled Eggs were just ok (I need to learn to make my own).  BUT- the combination Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles was excellent.  The fried chicken was lightly battered and flavorful and the inside was moist.  The waffle was light and crispy and that bourbon maple syrup was a perfect match for this signature dish.  The chilled spiced watermelon had a ""kick"" to it and was refreshing.  The Mama's Chicken Biscuit was good too, but I think I would have just ordered a side of biscuits. Since I was celebrating my birthday, they gave me a complimentary dessert - warm bread pudding with bourbon and this dessert was moist and had the right amount of sweetness.  We returned for drinks later in the evening and they stayed open past 11 p.m.  I am returning for lunch, dinner or for late night snack and drinks.",Lgmfl_A0cy72dwZfbuh9Tg,1,0,5,x4JV84w5r0_L2PlKzrT4eQ

We went as a group of five and had the chance to share a number of items.  Food was excellent.  The Kale salad is delicious if you want some greens,fried green tomato blt was great,  the biscuits are amazing, the fried chicken was incredibly moist and tender with perfectly crunchy skin and the bread pudding was delish.  I thought the deviled eggs were just okay, although my friends all seemed to like them a ton and I did not care for the blistered heirloom tomatoes(and I love tomatoes).  I found the prices to be fair, especially for a Vegas restaurant on the strip.  I'd give the  food a solid four stars.  

Service was awesome.  We had the best waiter whose name I don't remember! Brandon maybe? Super friendly, quick when appropriate but we were not rushed at all.  Totally helpful with what to order.  He actually gave us a recommendation for a chill bar to hang out at the next night.  They seated us at one of the tables right outside the kitchen.  It was super nice and fun to see all the food, but really too loud for our group.  It was difficult to hear one another.  It might be better if they switched these tables to four seaters instead of six.  If you're a group of five or more, I would not recommend sitting down in the main restaurant.  Really cool ambiance and decor.  The restaurant is a bit small-be sure to make reservations if you want to go.  

Drinks were good but largely bourbon based(in keeping with the southern theme of course).  I had the blackberry drink and it was a little bit strong for me but awesome flavor.  

Our bill was about $200 including tip for five cocktails, two salads, deviled eggs, two huge orders of fried chicken(we had some left over even) an order of biscuits and one dessert.  Since there were five of us, they were kind enough to add an extra egg and biscuit so we could each have our own(for a small charge).

We showed up without a reservation around 6:45pm and luckily did not have a wait at all. For dinner, we shared the BBQ pork belly, house-cut fries, mama's chicken biscuits, and I also had a small side farmer's salad. 

The pork belly was good -- it is served with a sherry apple glaze and some pickled salad. Make sure you have a bite of everything together. It's got a great flavor. The fries are my favorite!! Paired with a buttermilk dipping sauce and bacon bits... you would be crazy not to order these! Mama's chicken biscuits were good. In Miami Beach we had the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles, so we wanted to try something different here. The chicken was decent, but this is definitely a smaller ""sharing"" portion. There are two little sandwiches -- so you might want to consider ordering more to share or getting a larger entree depending on your hunger levels. When we saw the watermelon and waffles getting delivered to other tables, we were regretting our decision. The farmer's salad is decent to eat alone if you feel like you need a bit of greens in your life like I did. (Greens, an egg, and a smoked onion vinaigrette.)

Turns out for us, the biscuits were a good idea because we had some space for dessert. The fried oreos with oreo ice cream was amazing!!! It took a little longer than expected to arrive, but our server assured us that it was made to order. 3 oreos, breaded in rice krispies, and fried... served w/ oreo ice cream and chocolate. OMG.

He was so dope! He was so friendly, engaging, and very kind. He explained the concept and offered great suggestions. Although I've been to Yardbird Miami, he let my mother know how things work.

The fried chicken was amazing and even the white meat was moist.  Donuts had bits of bacon sprinkled on top and were delicious. The mac & cheese was a little runny. I prefer my mac & cheese baked and theirs was mostly cheese sauce. Still tasted great but not my favorite.  Peach cobbler was outatanding and served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  The biscuits were cold and the least enjoyable part of our meal but still tasted great. 

Pros: outstanding food, no waiting (we ate at 3pm), and good service.

Cons:  cold biscuits, kind of pricey for chicken and waffles ($36)

We were told we had to pay a deposit (I believe $150) and had to meet at least a $60 minimum pp. This should have been our first clue to run. I've never heard of such a thing in my life. The experience only went downhill from there.

When we arrived, there were several open tables, making the entire reservation/deposit situation unnecessary. The service was extremely slow, with some entrees coming out way before or after others. There was no rhyme or reason to the timing of the meal; entrees and appetizers came out seemingly whenever. The menu was small. We were there for hours. The food was nothing special. When the bill finally came, a manager accompanied our server, who told us that we didn't meet their asinine minimum per person requirement. We were presented with a bill of the most extremely random and shady charges, such as drinks that cost $40+, and a large amount of ""miscellaneous fees."" We also were told they were unable to split the check, after being told at the beginning of the meal that we could. 

We paid without incident, because I didn't want to cause a scene. I took a picture of the bill and called my credit card company the following day. I explained the situation and said I would pay for our food, drink, and gratuity, but I refused to pay any fees or extreme upcharges. Capital One filed a dispute on my behalf, and Yardbird, who had to have known they were in the wrong, did not fight it. I received a full refund on the items that I paid for but did not receive, which totaled over $100 in excess "" miscellaneous fees"" and upcharges.

They had a solid selection of local craft brews. Pretty much every genre of beer. I had a flight of 4 beers for a reasonable $12. My wife chose a Utah beer(Apricot Hefe). We started our meal with Fried Green Tomato BLTs as an app. Best pork belly I've ever had. So creative!

For the main course, I had the fried chicken with mashed cauliflower and Mac and cheese on the side. These sides could have been a meal by themselves. They were amazing. I'm from Michigan and Frankenmuth Fried Chicken is hard to beat. Well it got beat. 
My wife had a wedge salad with fried chicken. Simple ingredients done excellent. And for her side she got honey brussel sprouts. I don't like brussel sprouts and I liked these. Simply wow.

Then to top it off, Andy, the manager, came by to check on us during our meal. We told him our wonderful thoughts. He asked us if we were celebrating anything and we told him we were celebrating our anniversary. He said Happy Anniversary and we thought that was the end of it. Alas, our waitress, Mandy, brought out a wonderfully prepared caramel and roasted walnut bread pudding complete with a lit candle and a nice message.

To get 5 stars from me, food has to be on point. But what it really comes down to service. I listed my great service above, but what really caught our eye was when another patron didn't like her salad Andy personally came over to go over some other menu options to make sure she was satisfied.

515071,2017-05-17,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"**THE GOOD**

-The food tastes wonderful! I would give the taste and quality of their chicken a 10/10. What makes a good piece of fried chicken, in my opinion, are the following: skin is crispy enough to enjoy the texture but not too hard that it hurts to bite down, chicken is very moist inside, the chicken/skin doesn't get soggy on the outside. The Yardbird Fried Chicken has each of these great qualities.

-The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. I liked the fact that it is open and you can fit relatively close to other tables. It gives an excuse to brag about the good food!

-You get what you expect when you come here. You expect great tasting chicken, so you get the great tasting chicken.

**THE BAD**

-Price is very high in general and especially for a Fried Chicken dinner. Unfortunately $36 for a plate of Fried Chicken, Waffles, and small pieces of Watermelon isn't quite worth it in my opinion. I did know this coming into the restaurant so it was no surprise as I viewed the menu before booking the reservation. Even though I think this was the best Fried Chicken I've had, I don't feel the price reflects the plate I had (Watermelon is incredibly abundant and cheap to buy, good quality chicken can be expensive so this drives the price up, and the ingredients in waffles are very cheap to purchase). $25 sounds much more accurate for what type of food you're getting.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

It's worth a shot to try this place out IF you have the budget. Overall 4/5 for me.",msd5CTnYdVGpoT-2oLOrKQ,1,0,4,BNhs1Lt8RJ8nTo6qvOiPEQ

Pros:
- For food, really enjoyed the heirloom tomatoes (!!) and the mac and cheese.
- Decor is beautiful and inviting. Music puts you in a good mood immediately. Waitress was very friendly and welcoming.

Cons:
- Fried chicken was not as great as expected. Skin was soggy (not crispy) and felt like had been sitting for a while. 
- Peach cobbler was a true disappointment. Waitresses really highlight this dessert- it's their specialty and takes 30 min to prepare. It was massive, but I felt quality was sacrificed for quantity. It was too simple (no flavor to crust, much too many peaches) and tasted like something I can buy at Kroger.

After a long day of sessions at the conference, my husband and I decided to check out the Venetian. We quickly realized Yardbird was there (we've been to the Miami Beach location and love it!).  

We walked in and asked how long the wait was for two people. The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, but if a spot on the sofas opened we were welcomed to enjoy dinner there. Upon hearing this, Andy approached us and told us to give him two minutes. He went to each sofa and gathered two chairs and a few small tables and put them together so that my husband and I can sit down immediately. A M A Z I N G!

I believe in 2nd chances so while still in Vegas, I decided to take my work friends to Yardbird on Friday night. As soon as we sat, I explained my previous experience to our server. He wasn't an ordinary server but the corporate trainer who was filling in. He assured me that they will not repeat the performance from earlier and I am glad to say he was right. I upped my rating to 5 and would go higher if possible. I wish I could remember his name cause he was great. Brooklyn Hipster looking guy with a bad ass mustache. He knew the menu and made great recommendations. 

Everything was really incredible. We started with the Deviled eggs, Short Rib Biscuits, Grits, Cauliflower and the Wedge salad. The Wedge was the best Ive ever had. The pork belly melted in our mouth.

We then destroyed a Chicken & Waffles & Watermelon, 2 Lewellyn's and 1 Smoked BBQ. It was hot, juicy, crispy and everything that I expected. 

Steve, the director of operations, made sure to come by and check on us. The treated us like VIPs. 

The group collectively agreed that this was the best meal we've had during our last 4 Vegas trips and we've eaten at some fancy steak joints and other celebrity restaurants. 

I will say that YardBird has redeemed themselves and is back to being the BEST FRIED CHICKEN I've ever had.

620284,2017-09-02,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I would actually give Yardbird 4.5 stars and here's why (I'll start with the bad first):

If you plan on coming here with a group larger than 6, they don't take ""regular"" reservations, you have to go through corporate sales in order to get a reservation. BUT with that reservation you have to pay up front and have a pre-fixed menu (that's why I would knock off a star). 

However, one way to circumvent this issue is to just find a bunch of seats in the lounge area for your party since it's first come first serve. I ended up doing that for my birthday with a group of 12. We pulled a bunch of little tables and chairs together and were able to make it work for dinner. It was a little awkward but they offer the full menu in the lounge area and service was awesome! They were definitely willing accommodate us and our server was very attentive.  

The food and drinks are awesome! The fried chicken and waffles with watermelon is so GOOD!!! The chicken is so juicy and moist with the perfect amount of crunch. Even the white meat was super moist! The waffle was pretty good too, but the only problem is the bottom waffle gets soggy once you actually get to it. The shrimp n' grits, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts are also delicious! As for drinks, I'm not a huge fan of bourbon but their blackberry bourbon lemonade is good too, and it seemed like all my friends enjoyed all the drinks they got (not sure what they all ordered though).",WUbIK69vpDlFnSDgxzB_Kg,0,0,5,3AXdgw7tp_8aF2oDTrDBJw

Let me tell you THE FOOD IS AMAZING. . . My petite mom who is usually full after appetizers ordered the  the shrimp and grits after having the the chicken And waffles. I ordered the waffles after having the shrimp and grits. My brother, who is a pancake expert, devoured their chocolate chip pancakes.  On top of that, can't tell you how wonderful the staff was to us . . . the hostess, our waitress, the busboy and the managers and just about anyone else we encountered while dining there. My mom left some contents of her pocketbook in the lounge area. One of the managers tracked us down to return her wallet to us. She also forgot our to go bag. When we went back to ask if they still had it, a manager jumped to assist us and made us a fresh plate of the chicken and waffles without us even asking. I mean it was our fault that we left our leftover bag and she was so eager to help saying ""I know the leftovers are the best part"".  It was so heart warming!!! As we waited, the busboy came over and asked if I got my mom's compact mirror that she left in the chair. . .

Sat at the bar, and was ignored by a pair of bartenders, a white man and woman who seemed more interested in flirting with each other than serving me, handing me a menu, or even making eye contact, despite the man passing by me more than once. A second bar patron sat next to me with a Bouchon bag, and I decided to take my leave. 

Despite being there for fifteen minutes the hostess chose not to inform me a table was up. I was dressed to the standard of the room, quiet, and tried to flag down the bartenders. For how empty the place was, the condescension was ridiculous.

Very reminiscent of Grandma's home cooking but with an elegant twist. Executive Chef Melvin takes pride in the menu. We had the privilege of meeting Chef Melvin. It was a treat to hear all the passion, love and creativity he puts in the food.

Everything in the menu is a home run and here is a quick highlight of what we enjoyed:

-        Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles - The fried chicken, waffles and watermelon were out of this world. The chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection. The different textures of the fluffy light waffle and the subtle refreshing sweetness of the watermelon just made the different flavor components dance in your mouth.

-        The melt-in-your-mouth biscuits with the homemade apple butter were also a winner.

-        Fried green tomato with bacon--an addictive combo of salty bacon and slight sweetness from the tangy tomato

-        Brunch special Fried Chicken, Scrambled egg and gravy - I have dreams about this dish and wish I could have it for breakfast every day. You can taste the freshness of the organic, hormone free chicken and ingredients. The eggs were creamy and the best I have ever had and I have dined in many 5-star restaurants. The pork sausage gravy was the perfect complement to the dish tying everything together.

737471,2015-01-20,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Was here last night with a large party (16 of us).  I'm always leery of pre fix menus and usually find them to be a total rip off.  I also find that with ""group dining"" the service can be lacking.  Yardbird proved all of this wrong.  We had the most fabulous meal and cannot say enough good things about this place.  Our guests left raving.

Booking and planning the large party was fairly easy minus one issue in the contract that limited the time we could dine in the restaurant.  After we questioned this and worked it out  the rest was a breeze.  Nicole the catering manager was great to work with and was super accommodating with our questions and menu modifications.  We were sat in the private dining space which is awesome.  Tasteful design, good lighting and just a fabulous space overall.  

On to the food - OMG there was SO MUCH OF IT AND IT WAS ALL EFFING AMAZING.  Nicole assured us that no one would leave hungry, and we all left stuffed to the gills.  The food was too good not to splurge on and I loved that it was all served family style.  Here are the highlights:

Deviled eggs:  One of the better renditions I've had.  For deviled eggs, they felt really light and fluffy.  The trout roe on the top brought the dish together.  Highly recommend these.

Fried green tomato BLT: This dish was the highlight of the meal to me.  A++  The combo of the tender pork belly with the housemade pimento cheese was amazing.  I don't even like tomatoes and the fried tomato was divine.  Somehow they managed to not make this dish greasy one bit.  I don't know how they did it given the ingredients, but wow.  Just get this dish.

Mac n Cheese:  I liked this version.  It had a nice smokiness to it and I dug the breadcrumbs on top.  Presentation was great too.  

Ribs:  Fall off the bone good.  Solid sauce - not too heavy and not too light.  Just right.

Fried chicken: Again, how do they manage to not have everything be greasy?  Skin was crisp just how I like it.  The sauce that came with it had a great tabasco/vinegar flavor to it too. Meat was tender.   Personally, I like a little more  spice to the rub, but that's just a personal choice.

Biscuits: Great flavor and texture and I loved the honey butter and jam they served with them.  Perfect temperature too.

Shrimp & Grits: Another standout dish.  Perfectly cooked shrimp in a great sauce with tender pieces of ham.  The sauce mixed so well with the grits and shrimp that I wanted to lick the plate clean.  

Good lord - we were so full by dessert time, but how do you not swoon over crunch and munch bread pudding with popcorn ice cream and mini m&ms?  Again - get this dish.   Just when we thought we couldn't take anymore, out came a butterscotch, bacon, layer cake with bourbon ice cream.  Perfect combo of sweet and savory and if you are like me and don't like your desserts too sweet then get this dish.  

We were so full by the end of the meal, but the food was too good to leave around.  Oh and we had a ridiculous amount of leftovers.  

This place is not to be missed.  With all the crap food popping up on the strip these days by absentee chefs, it was nice to go to a place with some substance.  

PS - the drinks were pretty kick a$$ too.",fl0c5nPHTJ2zydFWFWqiIw,1,0,5,PBUAABU_CBJ_FC9f5AqC8g

We ordered the fried chicken, the Mac and cheese, and an order of their fries.  And we split everything between us.  The Mac and cheese was perfect. And I must say I usually always have to put salt on most places' Mac and cheese. This didn't need none at all! Fabulous! 

The fried chicken is amazing!  I had fried chicken at serendipity the day before and it was pretty good but this was way way better!  A must try if you come here! It comes with a honey hot sauce!  So good I could have drank it by itself.

744844,2017-07-13,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Ah. Maze. Ing. The food here is worth the stop. We made a reservation due to other comments on Yelp. On a Wednesday, at 6:30, they weren't necessary, but the hostess graciously wrote our names down. We arrived just before 6:30 and were seated near the kitchen (you can watch the chefs in action!).  About 5 min later a waitress brought our water and said a server would be with us shortly. After a 15 min wait of admiring the sweet southern touches of decor, I went in search of someone who would help serve us.  

I landed a gentleman, forgive me I can't remember his name, who explained that he is working for Yardbird as they expand to multiple locations. He apologized profusely about our wait.  He sat with us for several minutes as we placed our order....but then he said we needed to order more. He suggested the deviled eggs (heavily dilled), blt sandwiches (a fried green tomato topped with a a hunk of fried pork and frisée salad) and the blackberry lemonade. He comped all of those items for us. And, well, he hit the nail on the head. They all were amazing. We also had ordered the fried chicken (a massive meal of THE best chicken I've ever had), a wedge salad (corn, ice burg, dilled ranch, tomatoes) and fried okra. 

I will return. Not because we were treated amazing after a server error, but because the food was wonderful.  If you are in Vegas, I'd say it's a must!",3uBrYXaN6X65LkbzPRmuFg,0,0,5,Md0urz-xcm9n6GegtGK6kw

The service was impeccable.

The ambiance is great, the servers are lovely, and the food is to write home to mama about. The biscuits, chicken, fried green tomatoes, honey butter, bread pudding, and peach cobbler were all delish. The chicken biscuits were probably my favourite. Get all of these things!!
But the best thing in the restaurant is one of the managers, Sara Crane. She found out we had come back because we loved the food so much and came over to talk to us as we were stuffing our faces. She invited us back for the weekend brunch (if we were staying we would have gone!!) but we told her we were flying out in a couple of hours. We made a comment about taking some chicken biscuits to go and she laughed and said we should. And we decided to do just that! But before we could, she came over and gave us some chicken biscuits, wrapped tight for the flight, for the road, on her. Before we left we thanked her and hugged it out with her because she was so genuinely kind. 
Here's the awesome thing: meeting Sara was one of the best things that happened to us on our trip (and I was celebrating my birthday!). Her kindness reminded us that there are amazing people in the world and that life is about giving and being kind. The rest of our day was amazing. We paid it forward and thought about how we needed to be good people. 
We now plan to have a Sara Crane moment daily and do something kind. (We also want to be her besties!)

We were very happily surprised by the suggested whiskey--very tasty and very affordable (as bar pours go).  We  immediately added it to our shopping list!  

For a complete bar review we also tried the bourbon blackberry lemonade, which, as promised, was not too sweet.  A pleasant warm weather cooler with a nice tartness.  But once served the dram of Clyde May's, that cocktail sat there till we finished enjoying the Clyde's.

The chicken was tender and juicy, it seemed that it was even partially deboned for an easy splitting. We loved every bit of it. The watermelon cubes were tossed in some sort of mint and pepper flakes mix, which was surprisingly refreshing. 
The service was top notch, and we were even surprised by a luscious red velvet cheesecake for our first time visit :)

I would give them 4.5 stars out of 5. The prices were a little higher than what we expected for Fried Chicken that doesn't come with any side.",10iB6N_cOacNMW6AiJpw3g,0,0,4,M77shm-9wFGNOBhm_15jeA

I'm in Vegas for a conference and I heard that Yardbird had gluten free fried chicken so I had to go check it out. I was dining alone so I was seated right away. Both Carolina and Fernando were amazing, attentive, and made sure I was doing alright. The Gluten free fried chicken is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. But it's totally worth it. 

Already knowing that I wanted the GF Fried chicken, Carolina suggested I try the okra as well, which I had never had before. I about died when the GF fried chicken arrived, it's made with rice flour, but you cannot even tell. It is perfectly moist and crispy and probably better than other regular fried chicken I've had. I can't vouch for their regular fried chicken, but it also looked really good when the table next to me got it. The okra was good as well, but my sights were definitely set on the gluten free fried chicken.

If you are gluten intolerant and find yourself in Vegas, definitely make your way to Yardbirds, you will not be disappointed. The fried chicken is $24, but completely worth it as someone who missed fried chicken. The service is also top notch.",MyQlj-NCyX3gnfMFDHmUZg,1,0,5,V6OVL1EI84K9px4KOECwPA

Mama's Classic Buttermilk Biscuits - 5/5
Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken - 5/5
Louis Style Pork Ribs - 5/5
Salted Caramel Bread Pudding -3.5/5
Would I go back? Absolutely!

I love southern food and living in SF it's hard to find, maybe because it doesn't have kale. (Yardbird does have a Kale salad!) So on our way back from Zion we decided to stop at Yardbird in Las Vegas. It is located in the first floor of Venetian. 
Their logo and website is ""Run Chicken Run"", which I found amusing, although my friend thought it was cruel, she doesn't like to be reminded her food is resulting in death of living. The decor is contemporary and a bit dark. The service is courteous and professional.
For starters we got Fried Green Tomato BLT, Grits and Mama's Classic Buttermilk Biscuits. We were served the Mama's Classic Buttermilk Biscuits first with Honey Butter. The biscuits were warm, firm on the outside but soft on the inside, they went perfectly with the delicious soft butter. I would recommend to eat them as soon as they come to the table. Next we got Fried Green Tomato BLT, do NOT pass on these! I've only been introduced to Green Tomatoes a few years ago, and as a person who does not like tomatoes, I was surprised to find how much I like Green Tomatoes. It comes with house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam,
frisée, pimento cheese, pickled lemon vinaigrette. All in just perfect amount to go with the perfectly fried green tomatoes. Grits were creamy and thicker in consistency than the ones I have had before, needless to say, yummier! 
For the main course we had Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and St Louis Style Pork Ribs. Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken is what they are popular for, and it is all worth the hype. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with flavors going all the way deep in the chicken! St Louis Style Pork Ribs had the perfect amount of sauce and the meat was succulent. For dessert we wanted to get the Peach Cobbler but it took 25 minutes to make and they didn't ask us in time. We were too sleepy to wait. We ended up getting Salted Caramel Bread
Pudding. It was delicious, a little on the sweeter side and I wish they would substitute the cream with ice cream. 
Overall it was one of the best southern meals I've had. There is a lot on their menu I would like to come back for. I think it is going to be a staple for my visits to vegas.",LuJcBMkKXKHMxjSktEC03A,1,0,5,fkUL34tzREFjb-MQXMw_VA

We didn't even have to look at the menu, our server Jessie or Jessica (not sure what she goes by as her busser called her Jessie and our receipt said Jessica, but she was quite a character... had brunette hair done up in a really southern debutant style) was so knowledgeable, informative, witty and elegant she made us feel like VIP's at the chefs table, not to mention she was absolutely hilarious and went toe to toe with a few gentlemen in the group who had had ""a few"". She walked us through the menu, described several items and made recommendations and then when she saw us, group of 5 men all from different walks of life (business trip), struggling to figure out how and what to order she asked us to allow her to tailor our dining experience for us. Boy did she deliver! Deviled eggs, fried pickle spears, fried green tomatoes BLT, bone marrow...all amazing. Then came 3 salads, Ice Berg wedge with fantastic cubes of bacon and most amazing dressing made from a yogurt, tomato salad with peanut hummus, and a grilled mango salad followed by the best fried chicken I've ever tasted with an amazing sweet hot sauce, ribs (which they smoke right there), a spectacular short rib over grits (wish I could remember what the sauce was, it was phenomenal) and some sides, mac & cheese, charred okra, buttermilk biscuits and whipped sweet potatoes. We finished everything, Jessica knew exactly what and how much to order and didn't just try to push the pricy items to rack up a big bill to get a big tip like many servers would do, she truly wanted to please the customer and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals and certainly the BEST SERVICE I have ever had. The manager GREG stopped by our table close to the end of our meal and again, WOW WOW WOW, a true professional, very classy service!

899361,2016-01-23,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"When I passed by this place, the ambiance felt inviting. They have the southern thing going which is always correlated with hospitality. The designs in this place has southern touch: projector on the right showing still shots of famous musicians or just anything south, the music playing older country/blues/jazz, the jar covered lights on the next room, the big wood tables, etc. They also have a lounge area where if you prefer to eat, they have tables to serve food on. 

So enough about the looks, what about my experience. To say the truth, I expected more from this place. I ordered their ""famous"" Chicken and waffles, wife ordered their burger that comes with fries, a beer and mix drink, and the BLT appetizer. Our appetizers did come early. The appetizer was good tasting 'cause of the thick bacon and sauce they had on it. A part of me think it would have tasted better if the bacon and fried tomato was freshly cooked and served; it got to the table, not warm anymore. 

Next were the drinks. You'd think it'd come early, but it didn't. After the appetizers, it took 20 minutes before our drinks came: a beer and a mixed drink, which was not hard to do at all. 

Then came our main entrée. I had to check my watch several times as to the fact that our drinks came that late, it felt as though the meal was going to be late as well. The manager noticed and reassured us that the food will come in a couple of minutes. I thought that was great. I saw him actually go to the kitchen to check on the food. And the food came couple minutes after and he helped serve the food, which was a nice gesture. Food came about 30mins after the order was in; so in terms of waiting, overall, 6/10.

So how was the ""famous"" fried chicken and waffles? I can say that I expected more. The breading on the chicken was made well and chicken was perfectly fried. But it came to the table not even warm anymore. I didn't expect how it tasted; it was bland, like chicken defrosted, then breaded, and fried. It didn't taste like they had time to brine it, hence couldn't taste the chicken at all. Even when it had the hot sauce on the side, dipping the chicken, I could only taste the sauce, not the chicken. I had a drumstick, a wing, a thigh, and a breast. I thought it was just the drumstick that didn't have flavor; all didn't. The waffles also didn't come warm. Was it great? I can say it's so-so with the whiskey syrup. I tasted my wife's fries and those were freshly made and hot, as well as her burger.  I saw how the others were served after us and I think the manager tried to correct this for the others as their drinks and food came on time.

The fact was, chicken and waffles were the ones RECOMMENDED by the waiter, but it failed to deliver. A southern looking place where their overpriced signature chicken and waffles didn't taste great. That's how I'd remember this place. I've been to lots of places where they serve fried chicken. Hattie B in Nashville tasted way better. And for the price as well, it pales in comparison. Order something else from this place and NOT the ones recommended by the waiter to be sure you get a warm meal.",DYwb5nR-Q3T0ihpv8MXcWg,0,0,2,FMZn89VuhZ3jWp3tnwW1TQ

They offered a special Thanksgiving menu but we opted for ordering off their regular menu. We ordered bone marrow, fried green tomato BLT, Half fried chicken and biscuits. I would eat their chicken and biscuits every day if I could! The biscuits were very dense (in a deliciously good way) and came with a sweet butter and a jam. The chicken was extremely moist and the breading was perfectly seasoned. I would like to come back to try the chicken and waffles.

Unfortunately, not everything lived up to the hype. The fried green tomato BLT appetizer was ok but not spectacular. There was far too much pimento cheese on them and I had to scrape a lot of it off otherwise it was completely over-powered. The bone marrow was amazing but I was really disappointed in the portion. We received one small bone and it didn't have much marrow in it at all. Looking through the pictures on yelp it seems we got the raw deal on the marrow. Everyone else seems to have had portions triple what we got. Major bummer.

992635,2015-06-29,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird at Venetian was another restaurant that piqued my interest during Restaurant Week.  It seemed to showcase much of their menu at the reasonable price of $40.15 per person. We had friends join us, our party of four was promptly seated in the center of the dining room for our 7:30 reservation. 

In addition to our restaurant week appetizer, we got started with Warm Farmer's Cheese & Watermelon ($5) it is a refreshing bite that is equally salty and sweet. A nice way to whet our appetite. 

Extreme richness followed with Deviled Eggs, the stiff peaks were topped with trout toe. The stunner was the Fried Green Tomato BLT. I've never had anything like it and it was mighty delicious. Crispy, creamy, salty, smoky... it was a fiesta for my taste buds. 

No one in our group opted for the shrimp & grits. Instead, we each had the 27 hour Fried Chicken and House Smoked BBQ Pork Ribs, with a side of Mac & Cheese and biscuit. We were blown away by the portion size. No one was going hungry tonight. The chicken is moist and it has excellent flavor - considerably better than most, but when it comes to fried chicken, I want crunch. Unfortunately the breading was soggy. Still, I liked it better than the Pork Ribs. The mac, was extremely cheesy. I cannot believe I'm saying this, but it was too cheesy. I wanted bits of bacon or jalapenos to make it more complex. Once I ate the crispy topping, I lost all interest in it. The biscuit was fantastic. I only wished there was honey or butter to slather on it.

It took us an extremely long time to receive dessert. We began to wonder if they were milking the cows to make the ice cream. I found the Apple Praline Bread to be worth the wait. Warm desserts with a cold ice cream is a weakness. The Mississippi Mud Pie was rather run of the mill. 

Overall, I was satisfied by the experience. It was a ton of food! Even if it wasn't all quite up to par. It is a fine choice to share some comfort foods among friends.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,4,3,CaRMHPSVjIq-TtBxoOh3Xg

Talk about southern charm and hospitality. We heard about Yardbird from a friend who lives on Maui. While deciding on a new place to eat, my husband remember chicken and waffles in Vegas. I quickly turned to Yelp to look up chicken & waffles. The Yardbird came up as one of the search results. We knew it was on the Las Vegas strip and in either the Palazzo or the Venetian. Since we were already on the strip watching a show, we figured to get dinner after. I made my reservations online and it was as simple as that. 

When we got out of the show, we realized that I made the reservation a little later than expected. Thankfully, they had an earlier time that I changed via online and we didn't have to wait. While walking to our table, their bar area is very cute and resembles an open concept living room. After being seated at our table, our server was quick to greet us. He gave suggestions and advised of house specialties and gave us a few moments to review the menu. [Word of caution - majority of their specialty cocktails include some type of whiskey.] After a thorough reading of the menu, we both decided on the Chicken & Watermelon & Waffles and also the classic buttermilk biscuits. While waiting for our food to arrive, I noticed the mason jars with flowers as the table centerpiece. Simple and quaint. The light fixture in the main dining room was also decorated with mason jars around the light bulbs. I really find comfort and joy in the simplicity of southern décor. 

Our food and the biscuits made their way to our table. The biscuits were so warm and soft. The whipped butter and homemade blackberry jam enhanced the taste of the biscuit. Each piece of chicken (wing, thigh, breast, and  drum stick) was coated with crispy goodness. When you bite or cut into the chicken, you can see the juices ooze out. Definitely not a dry pieces in the pile. [Word of advice: eat the breast piece first] The waffle was truly amazing especially when you pour the bourbon syrup in each little square and let it get soaked up. The watermelon cubes were an interesting touch to the dish. Each cube is infused with spice. It is an acquired taste. I am not a big fan of watermelon so it wasn't my cup of tea. 

We were beyond expanded after dinner and could not enjoy a taste of dessert but we did have room for coffee and bailey's. Nice way to end out night with a night cap and games.

The sauce was savory deliciousness. Additionally, I ordered a side of the roasted cauliflower with pumpkin seeds and raisins and it absolutely did not disappoint.

Started with the chicken biscuits (2). Chicken was nice and moist on the inside with a crispy breading. The biscuits were not - they were dry on the inside and rock hard on the outside. Maybe we got a bad batch?

I then had the brisket sandwich for my main. The brisket itself was quite good - a bit oversauced but good. The bread was (again) dry, and the sandwich was sloppely put together. The fries were excellent.

My wife had the chicken sandwich. They used a hamburger bun... an untoasted hamburger bun. It simply couldn't hold the sandwich together and immediately fell to pieces -- Fail. 

Very disappointed.",nRfJBg-4MwxtJG4-TgnFow,1,0,3,VgMaPPcfGl5HFCPJm755Ww

We went in for dinner at about 9:30 without a reservation and were pleased to be seated promptly.  After hearing so many good things about the place we went with the fried green tomato appetizer and the chicken and waffles.  The fried green tomato appetizer was okay, but the pork belly on the top was so tough and chewy that it was inedible.  There were 4 pieces of fried chicken - a breast, a leg, a thigh (I believe) and a wing.  The chicken had decent flavor but was soggy as if it had been sitting for awhile.  The waffle was cold and very hard, again as if it had been sitting.  The watermelon was very good, but hardly enough to offset the poor quality of the rest of the meal. Service was okay until we asked for separate checks so we could use our individual room comps.  We got attitude and it was clear the server was annoyed, although he wasn't busy.  He said he had to get a supervisor (or someone) to take care of it.

1019610,2016-05-18,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Went to Vegas with a group of friends and we all stayed together at the Palazzo. We were feelin' lazy and luckily this place sits right by us. Came here for a late lunch on Friday around 2:30 so we didn't have to wait for a table for 6. The atmosphere and interior design is super southern country chic and had a very nice ambiance. We were seated right by the kitchen window/counter so you could see how they prepare food. All the food we had was absolutely delicious and amazing! I loved everything! 

For drinks I got the Porkchop ($14). A very interesting flavor as it is mixed with bourbon, Dijon syrup, Yuzu juice and apple cider and then has a Dijon thyme ice cube that secretes more Dijon flavor as it melts so it kinda pronounces the flavor more as time goes by. I admit I was quite confused when I started drinking it and the waitress described it as ""a fun drink,"" but grew to love it. The lemon shandy (also $14) was also suuuuper nice and very refreshing, I would def recommend that too. 

We started with the Mac and Cheese ($9), roasted cauliflower, and the Deviled Eggs ($11). All our appetizers were super yummy but if you are a fan of deviled eggs, you MUST get the deviled eggs here!!! They are absolute HEAVEN!! Definitely on the top list of deviled eggs in my book. I saw so many pics of them on Yelp and knew they must be good and boy I was not one bit disappointed! Probably one of my fave things at this restaurant in all honesty, but I'm a huge fan of deviled eggs so perhaps I'm biased. 

For entrees I ordered the Chicken Biscuits ($14). The biscuit is so good and the chicken was top notch. Thick, tender, juicy hunk of chicken, loved it! It was 2 biscuits sandwiches but I was very full after. My friend and her husband split the Chicken and Waffles with watermelon ($36) and its served with hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. Another friend just straight up ordered the Bacon Maple Donuts and seemed to enjoy that just fine. They looked delicious but I didn't get to try it. 

Now for dessert.... I thought dessert was amazing. What I didn't think was amazing is our waitress clearly forgetting to put our order in early for the Peach Cobbler yet not willing to admit it. RUDE. Waitress had warned us when we were putting our food orders in, the the cobbler would take 30 min to prepare. My friend and I hesitated but committed to dessert as we were in Vegas for vacay and didn't care! So it was very clear to the waitress that we wanted one. Yet when our meals were finished and she asked if we wanted anything for dessert, we just said we would wait for our cobbler and she had a slight confused look until saying ""yea, right, ok"" and walked away. After waiting 30 min our friend asked her if we could get something complimentary since we had to wait so long. They brought us our bread pudding (which I just thought was OK) and then finally after several more minutes, our cobbler came out. AMAAAAZING!! So good!!! I loved it!

What I didn't love was waiting for it almost an hr after finishing my meal. Kinda messed up considering I'm paying more here than a regular restaurant and expected better service than that. Was glad that they didn't charge us for the cobbler, but curious if they would have had we not said anything about us waiting. And bc of that ordeal I didn't give them 5 stars as I originally would have had everything gone the way it should've, so 4 stars it is.",wWfQzlgxd9-SntrW8_M8VA,1,0,4,aUCGXx62_gBHPzQSLV4cGg

The menu is very southern but so hard to decide from.  We had the maple bacon donuts for an app. Because breakfast needs an appetizer when it's this good!! Presentation was simple and clean.

You had to pay extra for sides.  No kids menu but we did order the macaroni and cheese which our child did not like, dry and bland.  So we then ordered the biscuits with chicken.

The ambiance is modern/eclectic with that hint of industrial that so many places are doing now. I like what they are doing at Yardbird. In theory. I just was immensely disappointed with the execution. 

SERVICE 

They stagger their food delivery so that items come to the table as they are prepared. Do you know what that means? We started eating our side dishes before our meal. And one side dish was scheduled to arrive last. Meaning it was to have been the LAST thing delivered to the table. I don't understand how that makes for a pleasant dining experience.  The server was certainly not to blame since this specific service plan is deliberate. I could see this pacing working when the dishes are all appetizers or finger foods or tapas. But you want to eat the mac and cheese WITH the chicken, not before. 

Pacing aside, when we had some unexpected issues with our meal, the manager was quick to address them and worked professionally and diligently to remedy the situation. That says a GREAT deal about their commitment to providing good service. And as much as I may not have enjoyed the food (see below), I did not leave having had a bad overall experience.

FOOD 

The Chicken: The meat was certainly tender. But the batter was not a southern/ country style that I know (and I guess prefer). Aside from needing seasoning, it had a light crisp as opposed to the deeper crunch and texture I like on a fried chicken. It reminded me a bit of Pioneer Chicken. If you know this old So Cal chain you know the type of batter Yardbird uses. It is a light batter with solid overall crispness.  While all sections of the bird are crisped, there is a lightness and smooth texture to the skin I do not enjoy. It is a totally personal preference.  I wonder if they are cooking using the ""broasting style"" I have heard about. 

The chicken wasn't bad, It was just not something I would go out of my way for. I found the ""lightness"" of the fried skin to be unsatisfying and the lack of seasoning was a huge disappointment. I do not like to pick up salt and pepper in a restaurant. And certainly not for fried chicken. 

The Grits: They were sweet. I could not take more than a few bites. They are also advertized as ""course ground"", but I've not had grits quite this course before. I was totally willing to have an experience with this style of grits (new to me), but the light sugaring was too much. I needed a savory compliment to the meal and the grits were a disappointment. I read that their fare is based on food traditions in the Carolinas.  I've never had grits in the Carolinas, but if this is what grits are like in those states, It'll be a hard pass from me in the future. 

The salad: butter lettuce with mango and sesame dressing. It was fine. The veg was fresh. And the salad toppings had a blend of sweet, crunchy, and savory. 

We had other dishes, but not one was tasty in the way we wanted them to be. Our dishes included mac and cheese, fried pickles (under seasoned), deviled eggs (too much dill), catfish. Nothing was terrible. But the problem of under seasoning seemed to be an issue in most dishes. 

The catfish had its own set of issues. The fish (like the chicken) was moist and well cooked within the skin, but it was under seasoned and the skin was coated in a batter that did not stick to the fish and crisp around the skin the way I like. 

All in all the food was disappointing. We all bring our experiences and biases to every meal and I certainly brought mine to Yardbird.  I thought the food was overpriced and underwhelming.  I hate to write a review after just one visit, but it left a strong impression. But hey, the restaurant was packed, so people enjoy what they are doing. I didn't. And I won't be back.

1156051,2016-03-03,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"One of the better meals I've had on this trip to Vegas - not life-changing but quite good nonetheless. Tried the fried green tomato BLT, the classic buttermilk biscuits, and Lewellyn's fine fried chicken and would recommend them all. The fried green tomato BLT was an interesting combo of tastes - honestly, I wasn't convinced of how well they went together and the dish was a bit on the heavy side for me. Probably would have preferred to have the fried green tomatoes just with salt and pepper. The biscuits were quite good - the honey butter and housemade jam were the highlight. The fried chicken was moist and tender but the honey hot sauce was the real star - spicy and vinegary.

The only thing I wouldn't recommend was their off-menu watermelon juice. It was truly horrible - tasted like it had been made with way overripe watermelons.

Our server was very attentive to us. She was quick to place an order to help stem my friend's pregnancy-induced nausea and continually checked in with us to see if we needed anything.

The front of the restaurant is the bar area and was incredibly loud. Fortunately there is quieter seating in the back. I had made reservations on Open Table so we didn't have a wait at all.",O1owVDyKZH312d7ajr2M3A,0,0,4,gemO_cy93MJtPXIrAz8PrQ
1157442,2016-10-31,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"On their website they describe this restaurant and its cuisine as ""A modern take on Southern comfort."" I could not agree more and believe that this place is so true in what they are trying to accomplish. We visited the Yardbird on a Saturday afternoon with reservations for four people and were seated immediately. The decor is quite rustic, but the whole ambience of the restaurant at the same time is quite classy. 

Servers were very professional and food was brought out in a timely manner. We ordered the Chicken ""n"" Watermelon ""n"" Waffles along with a side of bacon hash (yukon gold yams, onions, house smoked pork belly). 

Chicken ""n"" Watermelon ""n"" Waffles= honey hot sauce, chilled spice watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup.

This was more than enough food to share between the two of us. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the bacon hash and chicken, while I was more into the chicken, waffles and watermelon! Let's start with the chicken, my goodness it was the juiciest and most tender fried chicken I have ever eaten! The waffles paired very well with the chicken and bourbon maple syrup. I enjoyed every single bite. The watermelon was chilled and spice, to me it was very herb-like and fresh. I enjoyed the watermelon and found it to be somewhat of a palette cleanser and a good way to end our meal, whereas my friends and husband did not like it so much. If you're a fan of seasoning your fruit then I think you'll enjoy the watermelon as much as me, it was so refreshing! 

I wish they had a location near me so that I could visit this place for Sunday brunch!! The next time we're in Vegas, I am definitely going to revisit!",GGZiTkWXjhiKKKTZMciq6g,1,0,5,uR368PZ2XL05PliywhcDcQ
1162306,2018-06-01,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Wow, everything about Yardbird Southern Table & Bar was above and beyond. We were greeted immediately as we entered the restaurant, everyone had a smile on their face. We were led to our table right away and we loved the atmosphere already. The environment had a rustic vibe with a hint of modernism. It didn't feel like we were inside a hotel at all. The server took the time to explain thoroughly what Yardbird is known for as we told her it was our first time there. We ordered the biscuit and gravy, as well as the chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles to share between the three of us. For drinks we ordered peach mimosa, strawberry mimosa, and southern peach. 

The food arrived very quickly, even before our drinks. The server explained the dishes to us once more and provided hot sauce for the chicken and bourbon maple syrup for the waffles. We were super excited to eat. The chicken was just delicious, it was juicy and so tender. I had no problem cutting the meat with my knife, it was also soft enough to cut with your fork. It tasted great even on its own without any hot sauce. If you like spicy, the hot sauce added a nice kick to the chicken. The waffle were not just any regular plain waffle, but a cheddar waffle. You could really taste the cheese so you know they didn't hold back on the ingredients. The syrup definitely enhanced the flavour of the waffle. The chilled spiced watermelon was new to me. It had a very interesting taste to it as I wasn't used to watermelon being savoury. It was refreshing too but I preferred my sweet watermelon. 

The gravy and biscuit was great comfort food. I liked how the gravy was not too salty and it didn't overpower the flavour of the chicken. The biscuits were so soft and flakey, it was perfect to absorb all the gravy and egg yolk. The poached eggs just tied everything together. Everything was perfect with the chicken and it was filling too. 

I wasn't too fond of my Southern Peach as I thought the alcohol was too strong for me and the peach flavour was lacking. However, I liked the strawberry mimosa when I tried it, it had the perfect balance. It was more enjoyable than the Southern Peach. 

Service was above and beyond, right from the moment we entered to when we left. As mentioned above, the server explained their menu to us. She returned after to make sure everything was good at our table. Besides that, two managers or customer service reps, dropped by at different times to check up on us. And that is how you get returning customers, service was truly excellent. If you are in Vegas, you have to visit Yardbird Southern Table & Bar.",EVTiEA7mFTD0hIaWlxwONQ,0,0,5,2swDDmWEzI70L9lzhy3v3A

1169810,2015-02-02,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I came here with high expectations after reading reviews of both this location and the original in Miami. I left sorely disappointed. 

During a slow lunch service, we ordered the Mama's Chicken Biscuits, the Crunchy Yardbird Sandwich, and the Mac and Cheese.

As far as the chicken biscuits, the actual biscuits were wonderful: buttery and fluffy. They were exactly what a biscuit should be. The pickles were gross. I have never liked sweet and sour pickles, and I was in for a surprise as I popped one in my mouth. (We opted to order the biscuits without the pepper jelly). 

The chicken is very weird. It's almost as if the staff takes a piece of white meat, a piece of dark meat, and sticks it together before battering and frying. I am not big on dark meat, so I was not happy with it. I could only take a few bites before I decided it really just wasn't worth the calories, and I did not enjoy it. I will give it to the chefs, as it was juicy. 

The Crunchy Yardbird Sandwich had mayo and more of the yucky pickled vegetables. This was not listed on the menu, and I would have a preferred a head's up on these items, as I do not like them. the bacon is not so much bacon as it is pork belly. The hot sauce is definitely the same honey hot sauce on other items. Again, they're adding sweetness where I would really prefer they left it out. 

The Mac and Cheese was okay. Not bad, but I can make better, and why come to a restaurant for something that you can make better? 

The food is also fairly pricey. Especially because I left feeling that my calories could have been spent better elsewhere.

The decor and service were top notch. Not only is the environment warm and welcoming, but the staff is so attentive that it is on par with a fine dining restaurant. But, ultimately, I don't come to restaurant for the service and atmosphere.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,2,1,2,ZqVhtJXfRLcHyLw9KSqO0g

My girlfriends and I ordered the ""Mac and Cheese"" ""Corn Bread"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes with Pimento"" ""Maple Bacon Donut"" and of course the ""Fried Chicken""

The Mac and cheese was nothing spectacular, and I always order a Mac and cheese to try out in every resturant I go to. My top places for that is Table 34 and Yard House! Yumm yumm

The Corn Bread had real corn kernels inside the bread with a lime zest whipped butter. The Kernels were rubbery. Didn't taste fresh.

Fried green tomatoes with pimento and bacon need some acidity to the plate. So I added a squeeze of lemon wedge and it tasted better.

The Maple Bacon Donut, ohh so sad.. It was so Doughy and not enough glaze and bacon for the whole donut. We all had one bite and left the other half. They should make 3 mini donuts instead of one large one.

1230243,2016-12-14,3,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"All right. A good one-time experience. It's not a bad place, but it faces so much impossible competition on the Strip. I understand that the big star of the show is the brined chicken, and yes, it was good. Bursting with flavor, sufficiently moist, really tasty. But small portions, exorbitant price for fried chicken which one tries to rationalize away by repeating the mantra, ""You voluntarily decided to eat at a major hotel/casino on the Strip"", while trying to slow down one's eating to make those limited pieces of chicken last as long as possible. Bone marrow was on point too, but other places in the area also make the exact same dish at the exact same price point while throwing in some greens on the side. The drinks were fine, but I feel sorry for the person who is responsible for the ""hand cut ice"" they proudly boast on the menu. Does hand-cut ice taste different than machine-cut ice? Am I just too plebian in my understanding of haute cuisine to understand the significance of elbow grease-infused ice vs. ice cut by cold, unfeeling Cyberdyne machines?

HOWEVER! I have to give a special shout-out to the peach cobbler. We ordered it at the beginning of our meal since the menu said it takes about half an hour to make - and were so glad we did. It was DIVINE, and more than enough for two. A delightfully crumbly yet dense layer on top, warm and sweet peaches inside, accompanied by ice cream, a caramel 'cone', etc... it was just awesome. I would not come back for the chicken, but I sure would come back for the dessert. That, and the nice service, is what earns Yardbird a 4 vs. a 3-star rating from little ol' me.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,5,5,4,DAGR9ADvP6LUneINlmgR9w
1232009,2017-06-24,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I've heard good things about Yardbird, but I've also heard that it's a bit pricey. Thank God for Restaurant Week, because we got to experience this lovely place at a reduced rate!

My husband and I each had the $20 lunch special, which was a fried green tomato BLT, two pieces of chicken, a biscuit, cubed watermelon, and creme brulee. We split an added order of deviled eggs for $10, which were good but totally unnecessary because we had more than enough food! There were two BLTs apiece, topped with tasty pork belly and pimento cheese. The tomatoes were plump and juicy, and they were a meal by themselves! Loved the chicken (although I've had better--and worse!), and I'm not usually a fan of biscuits but these were flaky and delicious. I wish dessert had more of a Southern vibe, like banana pudding or apple pie, but the creme brulee had a nice hint of coffee and was a pleasant end to a great meal.

Our hostess and server were both surprised that we were locals, and I'm surprised at their surprise! You would think more locals would have found Yardbird by now. If you can make it during Restaurant Week, you can save a few dollars, but even at the regular rate, Yardbird is definitely worth a visit.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,Hd1xe-NZT4cBHb6rq8NYWg

The restaurant is chic, but relaxing. When you first walk in there's a bar area, a couple of sofas and a few tables. The lights were dimmed low which immediately softened the mood. As you walk to the dining area, the lighting is brighter and there's a projector flashing old pictures on the wall. 

Appetizer - We tried the fried green tomato BLT. I'm a Mississippi girl so you know I've had my share of fried green tomatoes. This appetizer definitely had its own twist. It was smoked pork belly, tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese with pickled lemon vinaigrette. That was a unique mixture, but I truly enjoyed this appetizer. 

Beverage - The Southern Peach cocktail was befitting with the comfort foods. It contained Old Forester 86, Aperol, fresh lemon & thyme with white peach purée and sweet tea. To top it off it was served in a mason jar with a 1 1/4 block of ice. This just took me right back to my hometown. 

Entree - The shrimp and grits had roasted tomatoes, Virginia ham, nora mill grits in a chicken base gravy. Spoon licking good! 

Dessert - We did not have room for dessert, but we tried the butterscotch cake anyway. Talking about hurting yourself. This cake had bacon frosting, butterscotch sauce, toasted pecans and bourbon ice cream. The sweet and salty was a perfect combination.

I had the eggs benedict and my gf had the fried chicken, waffle, and water melon.  Eggs benedict was good but nothing too special.  However, the fried chicken was amazing!  That alone made the meal delicious.  The waffle was also good, on the crispier side but still tasty.  The watermelon was standard.  I would definitely recommend the chicken without hesitation.

Yardbird is conveniently located inside the Venetian hotel close by to Delmonico's and Bouchon Bakery.

They are well known for their southern comfort food with an upscale experience. Our server was just a delight! His energy and his love for this kind of food is shown through his personality. We decided to try the omelet of the day that came with fresh fruit and fried chicken. Their biscuits are REALLY good... not flaky and not so buttery that it leaves that oily taste in your mouth.

It was easy for me to get a seat at the bar although it was a solid 10 minutes before I got attention from a bartender. To no fault of theirs really, but I tried two local Nevada IPA drafts and they were both mediocre.

For dinner I had the fried chicken meal with a spicy honey sauce on the side. For their signature item, I was pretty disappointed.

As far as the food, we started with the Mac n Cheese and fries. The first mc n cheese we got was cold which was odd to me. We asked for another one and that one was better. Still didn't think it was that great. The fries, on the other hand, were delicious.

You may need reservations if you are in large groups. The seating was comfortable and cozy; there were several large groups around us who were having a good time.

We tried the old fashioned and the southern revival drinks; good. The old fashioned is delicious but strong, so you may want to sip slowly until the food arrives. 

The appetizer menu was good. They will put bacon / roe on side for vegetarians if requested. The deviled eggs were good but not special. The fried green blt was really delicious with pimento cream cheese. 

The chicken waffle watermelon plate was as advertised- moist and crispy. Served with a good hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. We'd ordered sides of cauliflower and okra both were excellent and large portions. 

The best part of the meal was the peach cobbler. We ordered it at the start as they bake it from scratch. Best cobbler ever! I was full but could not help myself. Great presentation too.

This place looks great. Upon walking up, we were greeted by two lovely hostesses wearing white sundresses, denim jackets, and cute cowboy boots. Already I loved it.  Our party of four was seated at a smallish table surrounded by a comfy, yet stylish, leather couch and chairs. It reminded me of being in someone's living room and I dug it. A very nice server came over, welcomed us and explained their specialty cocktails. We ordered the blackberry lemonade and the ""Porkchop"". Both of these drinks were Bourbon based and both of them were outstanding.  

I tried:
The Deviled Eggs
The Fried Green BLT Sandwich (no bacon)
Smoked Chicken Salad 
Chicken Biscuits 
Salisbury Steak 
Whipped Sweet Potato

Everything was fantastic! The standouts of the meal (for me) were the Fried BLT (minus the B because I don't dig on swine). This sandwich was fantastic though I will admit the pimento cheese had me worried when I read it on the menu. When they sat it down in front of me, I could not get enough of it!  The smoked chicken salad was also terrific. The salad, which pairs the delicious smokey flavor of the chicken with cool avocado, is served over the most delicious corn bread I have ever eaten. The flavors and textures work perfectly and the dish is phenomenal. 

The deviled eggs were delicious, as was the Salisbury steak (covered in super yummy mushrooms). The only miss of the meal was the chicken on the chicken biscuit was a little dry. The biscuit itself was excellent. The whipped sweet potato was also delicious. Almost like having dessert with your entree.

Try the Southern Peach for a sweet cocktail. It pairs well with the decadence of the chicken. Oh, the deviled eggs are creamy and savory and not your mom's stuff she served at the holidays.

The hype of this particular place is buzzing, and honestly, this has been on my ""hit-lists"" spot to try, even before I landed in the city of lights. On our most recent trip, we were staying at the Palazzo, so obviously we headed here with no hesitation and heartful of expectations. 

We were lucky enough to snatch a reservation just a few hours prior, as this place is always crowded and RSVP is definitely a must! The restaurant is quite spacious, they got two separate areas for bar and dining and the latter was especially gorgeous. It has that Southern charm atmosphere and at the same time sophisticated and warm. The glass jar light bulb on the ceiling was the most noticeable feature about the interior, #creativemuch. 

Yardbird dead on simple menu was superb. It listed Southern comfort fare that sounded scrumptious, but for my first visit, I had my eyes on the main star of this restaurant. THE BIRD. Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffle: each order comes in 4 cuts, deep fried! blocks of chilled spiced watermelon and 2 slabs of cheddar cheese waffles. On a detailed note, the chicken was wonderful, crispy, juicy and flavorful. The waffle was yum, fluffy and buttery. The spiced watermelon, even tho playful with the flavors, it was just not my thing. 

Overall, this was good, but with a $36 price tag, it was a little heavy on the pocket. The portions, however, was pretty generous, could easily be shared between two, but as for me, I could have this all for myself, happily. 

In all, Yardbird Southern Table & Bar is certainly not disappointing in any way, from the beautiful space to the simple food with astounding flavors and supported with the service and ambiance for days. Can't wait to be back~",9lU5zOPluc6Y8JZUL9nzsQ,41,44,4,vkP-5G4vvXHBsXK0w9oxnA

Service was surprisingly very good. Our waitress was super friendly and went of her way to bring us cocktails, check on how we liked the food, and even split up all of our checks. Great SERVICE!! 

My friends and I shared the fried chicken and waffles, brussel sprouts, fries, and the gnocchi pot pie. 

Fried Chicken and Waffles (4 stars): I think the chicken were pretty darn good, crispy skin and good fry on the chicken. The waffles however were a bit soggy. 

Brussel Sprouts (4 stars): These were crispy with I think a bit of balsamic. Pretty good side dish. 

Gnocchi pot pie: (3 stars): Decent dish but probably wouldn't order it again. Comes with a biscuit on top and the gnocchi was decent but in the dish maybe just a bit overcooked and mushy. 

Fries: (2.5-3 stars) larger cut fries, and sprinkled with Bacon salt with a side of ranch. Larger cut fries aren't really my cut of tea and didn't wow me, but not bad to accompany the chicken. 

Overall I thought the food and the service was great. It was a bit pricey but cool atmosphere and pretty good fried chicken. I probably would be back.",c55ONBsSZBfaUN5Uhy-qGw,1,0,4,EeC8ewYCPFhvTRbKoqJ_Zw

I found Yardbird through the great reviews on Yelp, and came here tonight in a party of 4 for my 23rd birthday dinner, and we had an amazing time. The food was absolutely delicious. I don't have an incredibly refined or ""fancy"" palette, but I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal. As a cheese lover, the charcuterie & cheese board was perfect for me! Also, it was enough to for the table to share before having entrees. As far as the main course goes, there was not a single complaint at the table. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy and practically melted in my mouth - incredible. The macaroni and cheese, grits, and biscuits were also very delicious and in good portions. The mac and cheese had enough for the 4 of us to share as well. I would also recommend the cheese & watermelon appetizer, which had a different taste than what I was expecting, but it was delicious nonetheless. Also, shout out to our waiter JULIAN!! Wow, he was pleasant and awesome. He had a smile on his face the whole time, seemed genuinely excited about the menu, and was very attentive and overall just an amazing waiter. Thank you Julian and the entire staff at Yardbird for an absolutely excellent meal and experience!!!

The skin is crunchy and flavorful, They also have a tangy hot sauce that goes along with the chicken (it was a bit to acidic for me but my friend loved it) The biscuit was good it had a nice butter flavor and crunch. 
The sliced watermelon was pretty life changing! It is not spicey! It has a citrus coating which compliments the sweet from the watermelon itself which after a heavy lunch is refreshing on your pallet.
We also ordered the swine burger which is a burger mixed with short rib, brisket, and chuck. This also comes with a slice of smoked pork belly on top. It was a good burger but mainly average the short rib, and brisket wasn't very present in taste. 
We also ordered I believe it was a seasonal item the Louisiana Style Street Corn which was phenomenal. It had traces of spice and of cojita cheese with bell peppers, the corn itself was grilled just right to measure that sweet taste. This was mainly like an Elote (Mexican street style corn) in my opinion but very sophisticated!

Yardbird's specialty is their fried chicken. The kind waitress explained how the chicken is brined for 25 hours and flash fried in 3 minutes - quite impressive numbers! I guess bottom line: you get what you paid for. Chicken was delicious and moist on the inside, but for $26 for 4 pieces of chicken, I highly doubt I'll return for seconds. That's $7 for each piece! Ouch. 

We also tried some other side dishes including biscuit sliders and deviled eggs. They were pretty good as well.

Ambiance is chill, service is attentive, and creativity + execution of food was spot on. 

What to get:
- Deviled eggs: comes with dill, chives and caviar on top (best deviled eggs I've had and I hate dill!)

- Fried chicken /or fried chicken and watermelon waffles: I don't care which you get as long as you do the right thing and go with what they're known for. These juicy chicken parts are brined for 27 hours before being thrown into the deep fryer. The hot sauce it comes with is also so perfect and exactly what a hot sauce should be. It's not not spicy, not too spicy but has a significant kick that doesn't overpower the star of the show. #divine

- Fried green tomatoes: yes lawd! So bomb.. Crunch of the fried exterior with the overflowing juice of the tomato with each bite. To top it off it has pork belly, some cheesy mixture and frisée to make you feel you're consuming healthy greens :) 

- Bbq brisket sandwich: got this because they didn't serve the ribs at lunch (boo!) but was craving some bbq sauce. Overall it was solid but I feel the chicken is the better way to go if debating between the two. 

Love you yardbird. Even though I used two meal slots during my Vegas trip on you, I still can't wait to come back. Gratzie!",J1Rre3VkRbhfu2BnBOcZZQ,1,0,5,preuNqfZkv-QcbUtl_cLKw

The hostesses were saying that if we sat down in the lounge and ordered food, we wouldn't be able to move due to some policy?

Either way, we got seated in their private room behind the wine case and had a very pleasant experience. We don't remember the server's name, but to the wonderful lady who served us on July 9, 2016, you are awesome!

We started off the meal with coffees and Maple-Glazed Bacon Donuts. A complementary combo. I also got myself a mimosa, which had more champagne than juice, but it was sweeter, so it worked.

The Fried Green Tomato BLT is open-faced and unique. The flavor is subtle, fresh, and savory. We also got the special, which was Biscuits & Gravy with fried chicken, bacon, and egg on top. While the biscuits & gravy aren't anything to write home about, the fried chicken is juicy and the over-easy egg perfectly runny. The whole combination is filling and comforting.

We also got the Iceberg Wedge because it seemed refreshing. Although the iceberg lettuce itself is nice and cool, everything else is fairly heavy. It didn't matter though, as I still polished off the plate after it made its rounds. The house-made buttermilk ranch should be a guilty pleasure.

Overall, ask the servers for recommendations. The bachelor crew was also here at another table and didn't care for the Deviled Eggs for example.

1363890,2015-02-16,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"REVIEW 1 OF 2
Let me start of this review by proudly proclaiming that I am high maintenance in my expectations of restaurants and bars these days.  I don't say this because I suffer from unrealistic expectations or think my own ""specialness"" requires five servers to be at my beck and call. No, I am high maintenance in my expectations because of the Food and Drink Revolution that has swept the Nation over the last seven years.  What started as a trickle and can now be found on street corners tucked away in your own neighborhoods is the undeniable smell of local ingredients being smoked, braised, fried, sousvide, and grilled in endless modern recreations of timeless classics.  This return to the basics is the result of massive corporate chains that used central plants to create their staple ingredients, which they had shipped nationally, and in the process ensured uniformity, consistency, and preservative laden, tasteless entrees that planted the seeds for the grass roots insurrection that we all have the pleasure of experiencing and tasting.  
This brings us to a last minute weekend getaway with my Wife and another couple that shares our work hard, play hard mentality.  Last minute flights and rooms for Valentine's Weekend are possible while getting a seat at some of the Top ""Occasion"" spots is a bit more challenging.  As a result, we explored newer venues and hidden gems which in this case brought us to the front door of YardBird, which sits in between the Palazzo and The Venetian.  Clean lines, wood, comfortable chairs and tables in the lounge, a prominent bar to the left, and the warm glow that only Edison bulbs can bring welcomed us, while the smiling hostess took us to main dining room for our Saturday morning brunch.  My first glance at the menu had my mouth watering because after 24 hours of Vegas shenanigans, I was ready to coat the stomach with some serious chow and also the hair of the dog that bit me.
We were greeted by Andrew, who helped guide or choices and happily he convinced three non bourbon drinkers to try the house's signature Old Fashioned.  My love affair with this cocktail has lasted for about a year now, and I have seen many bars fail miserably in creating this simple, classic and delicious cocktail.  Andy brought out the 4 drinks and I was happily surprised to see 1 floating sphere of ice in each hi-ball glass.  This ball of ice melts slowly, which reduces the watering down of what the bartender has created for you.  Andy then repeated that the Buffalo Trace Bourbon is house infused for this drink, and let me tell you......it was delicious.  As most old fashioned drinkers can tell  you, the 1st one goes down slowly as you sip at the potent yet simple combo of flavors, but by number two, the sips become larger, the voices a bit louder and of course all the jokes become funnier.  We immediately ordered the Chicken and Watermelon and Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits.  We ordered to share, which is the best way to dine in my opinion, and an awesome benefit to being coupled up!  It was explained the plates would come when ready vs. when the whole ticket was completed to maximize the freshness of the entrees.  I like that!
The 1st dish was the Chicken, and it was awesome.  I was immediately sad that I had to share, then aggressive in my grab of the big breast that was topped with a thigh, wing and drumstick.  The chicken was amazing!  Gorgeous and flavorful crispy skin hid the juicy meat that I picked clean from every bone, while the house made hot sauce, although unnecessary, was the perfect combo of vinegar and heat.  Most chicken and waffle plates, including the LA staple that popularized this dish, aren't very good at the waffle part of this equation, but these guys delivered.  Crispy and hot waffles, served with butter and REAL syrup.  Then 3 perfect cubes of watermelon heart that offer a sweet and subtle palette cleanser.  The four of us demolished that plate, and in turn ordered 4 more cocktails!  The Shrimp and Grits were next and it did not disappoint.  Look, I am from Texas originally and understand the power of grits, which I prefer buttered and served with a nice cup of coffee!  This was not your Momma's out of box instant grits.  The grainy texture was intended and noticeable, while the chunks of ham that were folded in were a nice compliment to the generous portion of shrimp that was on top.  Most places are pretty cheap with the shrimp, but we had at least 8 large tail on sea dwelling critters and the forks were working overtime.  This led to the whole table being parched, so we needed a final round of drinks before we got the check........and entered another good 8 hours of gambling and various other Vegas activities.",bk_-Qb_YFJQnZssbgnSLIw,1,0,5,b2JvzBSroFE8fQ2lqhOe4Q

We also had fried okra (which isn't my thing but my parents absolutely loved) and mac & cheese (parents also loved; it was cheesy but tasted of velveeta, which I don't care for, but know is popular, esp in the south). Went here for dinner on Christmas Day; in hindsight, we should've made reservations bc the wait for a table was 1.5 hrs. They offer lounge seating, which we opted for, but of course wasn't ideal, but also not horrible.

Out of all the items I would say that the chicken was OUTSTANDING the best item of the evening.  The drinks were average and the deviled eggs were so so.  For me the eggs had no flavor.  You want creaminess with an egg, mayo of sorts, and their eggs are almost bitter.  The mac-n-cheese was very good.  The waffles were fabulous as well.  The atmosphere was ok, but I found a  lot of the workers talking to each other and one quest, when they should have been making their rounds with all the guests.  Overall very good, but not on the top of my list to return to with so many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.",4eCXQhJerqWMp9qznMBaOg,0,0,4,v1aPTL8ph4S2CAQYx-s0-A
1377665,2015-06-02,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"A friend of mine raved about the fried chicken at Yardbird.  I think that my expectations were too high.  We ordered the Chicken 'N Waffles 'N Watermelon to share.  The portions were generous, but I didn't think that the fried chicken was rave-worthy.  In fact, I thought it was rather ordinary.  I actually think that the fried chicken at the Palms cafe is much tastier.  And I really didn't appreciate the spiced watermelon.  Fresh watermelon tastes good unadulterated; I thought that the spices detracted from fresh fruit.

We also got the ""today's omelet,"" which was a vegetarian one with asparagus and cheese.  Compared to the other dishes, this one appeared chintzy in size.  It also wasn't visually appealing.  It looked like something you would get on an airplane.  It also tasted like something you would get on an airplane.

The butter lettuce grilled mango salad was pretty good.  Very good portion size and tasty.  We also ordered the cornbread and mac n' cheese.  Those two sides were very delicious!

All in all, Yardbird is good food if you aren't too picky and just need to fill up on something.  I thought that the service was slightly on the pretentious side.  Our coffees were never refilled.  And when we wanted our check, the waiter tried to push dessert on us REALLY hard.  He must've asked at least 4 times!

1387709,2018-04-26,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I'm in fried chicken heaven. 

Came on a Saturday night and you have to wait for a lounge area table to clear up or bar area - on your own, if you didn't make a reservation. We waited about 10 minutes and found a row of 4 empty bar seats so we sat there! 

I shared the following with my friend:

FRIED CHICKEN
The fried chicken here was SO good - definitely an upgrade from KFC lol,  This is your typical American style fried chicken. Taste is really savory and the chicken falls right off the bone. The breading is seasoned well and tastes like authentic fried chicken. The only sad thing is that it only comes with 4 pieces of chicken, for about $30. The price is definitely steep. Might be a bit hard to share between 2, but then again, I'm not sure how I would feel about eating so much fried chicken either. 

MAC N CHEESE
The mac n cheese was really good - it gave a great first impression. But as you continue eating, you kind of realize how heavy it is. The noodles are cooked more on the soft side than the al-dente side. The sauce is made from a classic bechamel, which gives it such a creamy heavy texture. Good thing the portion is small or else it would be difficult to finish. 

BUTTER CABBAGE SALAD WITH MANGO / PECANS 
Refreshing! This was my first time having butter cabbage, and it was really good! The salad came with young mango (crunchy) and pecans scattered throughout. The cabbage pieces were quite large, not really chopped or shredded or hand torn... kind of just a giant piece of cabbage. Not beautiful to stuff in your mouth, but the salad's taste was on point, nonetheless. 

WATERMELON SLING
The watermelon sling was a pretty refreshing and sweet drink with that classic deep whiskey taste. Paired well with the heaviness of the fried chicken and mac n cheese. Definitely a palate cleanser. 

OLD CLASSIC
Tasted like an old classic. 

Again, I shared these items with one other person and we both left feeling pretty satiated. I was about a 7 and he was about an 8 (in terms of fullness on a scale of 1-10).  **Pro tip: make a reservation before you come!",m19IzjDyYKtIlWJSjytU2A,2,2,5,YrQCaKbiBgfuo48qud5zKQ

I started with a bloody mary $15 which had the perfect kick to it, coffee $5, and my husband had a beer which was reasonably priced at $8 for Vegas. My husband ordered the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles and I ordered a biscuits and gravy special they had with bacon, their fried chicken and an egg on top. Both were SO GOOD, but the fried chicken is the star here. The hot sauce they serve it with is amaze and its so crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. yum. our bill was about $88 which isn't insane but not cheap.

No regrets here, the portion was still massive and very affordable at $14. I loved the pickled onions that came with it and pepper jelly on the chicken for a nice little spice. Also winning was the Kale salad - very fresh and some much needed veggies.

It was brought out partially cold so that ruined it completely.  Our server Roman J. wasn't around enough to check in on us.

Totally bland.  The cherry on top was when I was almost done with the salad I found a hair in it -- now anyone that knows me knows that this is a bad as it gets for me.  Totally disgusting.

The watermelon, waffle and fried chicken entree was to die for. The chicken was moist and crispy, almost as good as Roscoes. The waffle was amazing - super fluffy and that syrup was the perfect complement. Then you get to the cold watermelon chunks that are seasoned with some type of deliciousness! BOMB.

1399315,2016-10-20,8,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"After a few cocktails at the Golden Tiki we were off on our Yelp adventures with the assistance of Uber to the Venetian for a late lunch/brunch date at the Yardbird. My trusted Yelp confidant, Greg F. informed me of this place and then I noticed my other yelp peeps who visited as well. This place is beyond doubt one of the best stops I have ever had in Vegas. Since it was 3pm securing a spot was easy. I was able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the short ride over. When you get to the Venetian you can walk through the casino towards the theater or if you are upstairs in the canal shoppes find your way down to the bottom floor. 

The front has a nice open look and there is a large bar with some lounge seating available with plenty of TVs at the bar. We weren't sure what to expect with the seating arrangement. We were taken to the back of the restaurant closer to the kitchen. Some of the tables are kind of tight. You will have to squeeze in between other people eating to get in your seat. That was probably the only negative thing about the seats but the seats were comfortable and the table had plenty of room. The lighting was nice, not too bright or dark but just right. Tyler our server came by right away and introduced himself and then shared the daily special and explained the brunch menu. Then we were given some complimentary champagne, which was very good. I informed the restaurant on OpenTable about our anniversary. It was a nice little surprise for the wifey. 

Just a warning: The food portions are ginormous and can easily be split. With that said, it was no holds barred and I dove into the deep end without my floaties. I knew there was no way we would finish everything but who cares, it's Vegas and going all in is the name of the game. I started with some maple bacon donuts and I was very impressed. The deviled eggs were something I have never been into but my wife insisted that I give them a try and I was glad I did. Tyler recommended the brunch special for $20, biscuits topped with a fried chicken breast, bacon, gravy, and eggs. It was beyond delicious. I wanted to slap myself because I thought it was all a dream and did not believe that this concoction of gravy, biscuits, and bacon could be so rich. I have tried similar platters at other run of the mill breakfast spots and never had the same euphoric feeling. I usually feel miserable after eating at those other spots. It was completely different here. It was like I never wanted it to end. 

My wife ordered the Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles ($36). I would have paid 2x that for that plate. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection. Tender, moist, and no dry part on the bird. The waffles are cheese infused and the watermelon had a sweet flavor to it. The food is densely packed with all the carbohydrates and calories you will need for a week. We even ordered a side of biscuits but those pretty much went to waste because we barely ate half of each of the plates. I even offered to share some appetizers with the guests around me because we had so much food. 

During our meal, Sandra one of the main chefs overheard we were Dodgers fans from the LA area and she offered to buy us dessert. We went the banana pudding. I thought it was going to be a bowl of banana pudding but it was a jar with sponge cake and vanilla wafers, with the pudding topped with baked shaved bananas. It was truly amazing. Thanks, Sandra for the wonderful dessert. I wanted to give a special shout out to Tyler. He made our experience that much more memorable. It was like he knew what we wanted before we ordered it. He was very friendly and lots of insight on the menu and different offerings. We were lucky to be seated in his section that day. He needs a medal or a raise would be better. 

The strip is a great place to hang out but most of the time you find overpriced food or restaurants that have a very trendy look inside with loud music blaring in the background. I was surprised to see such a simple yet classy looking set up at the Venetian. Yes, the food is not cheap but it is not that expensive. Our entire meal with several beers and cocktails ran me close to $130 which was not bad. Give them a try. BTW, uber from one end of the strip to the other is $8-14 depending on the time of day.

I had the chicken, breast, and leg with french fries but I wish I would have ordered the half bird. Because the birds are steroid free, they are a small. The chicken was cooked to perfection. It was a little salty, but that's how we do things in the south. The skin to meat ratio was perfect.  I was enjoying dinner alone that night and there was a gentleman next to me. He and I struck up a conversation and talked for hours. Yardbird did not constantly bother us with check-ups, try to rush us out, or bring us the bill too soon.

Ambiance is great. Love the decor and seating layout. Service was great as well. 

Drinks- extensive beer list but I'm a girly girl who likes girly drinks and beer wasn't cutting it for me. I was a little ""iffy"" about their mixed drinks that boasted of whiskey and bourbon. Usually that stuff is too strong. So I spoke to the waiter and expressed my concern and he suggested the southern revival he said I will get the flavors I want without the strong whiskey like taste and he was not kidding that drink was good!

Apps - we ordered the deviled eggs. It was good, filling had a lil too much mustard in my opinion but yummy. 

Entrees - daughter ordered fries and buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. Aunt ordered fried chicken and I went big by ordering fried chicken, watermelon and waffles. Omg best fried chicken ever, the syrup for the waffles was delicious nice subtle bourbon flavor that was phenomenal and I hate bourbon. The waffle was PERFECT!  The watermelon provided a great contrast. The honey hot sauce for the chicken was DIVINE. Chicken was perfect, moist, flavorful and crispy!!!!!  Next time in Vegas I'm coming back.

I know that while in Vegas you want to go all out with the seafood, steaks, etc. However that was my craving and this spot exceeded our expectations. The chicken is ridiculously good and seasoned to perfection. Moreover the tenderness was unbelievable and so we plan on taking a trip soon to return. Our host was Tracy and he made our experience all the more greater, and added the cherry on top! Not only is he well versed in the restaurants history, preparation techniques and so much more...he is a funny guy and very entertaining.

1435938,2017-02-19,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"This is a total bummer to write.  I love the concept of this restaurant.  When I was researching where to eat on our Vegas trip, this was the first reservation I made.  We went yesterday.  The food was mostly fantastic.  But the service was SO bad, so unbelievably bad, that I have to write this review.  If I was rating on the food alone, this would be 4 stars.  We went for brunch.  Got seated promptly, waitress immediately came over and told us the special and went over the menu.  Then she left without offering to take a drink order or bring coffee, she just walked away.   Okay.  So we look over the menu, decide on what we want, put down the menu, and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Look around, half the restaurant is empty, so that's not the issue.  Table next to us (different server) sat down after us, they've already ordered.  We wait.  Table next to us gets drinks.  Finally waitress arrives, takes order.  We wait.  Table next to us gets appetizer.  La la la la.  A while later, busboy bring husband's drink.  Wrong drink.  Sigh.  I try to point this out to a waiter as our waitress is gone.  He tells me ""I'm not your waiter and I didn't deliver the drink, so I can't help you"" and he walks away.  Okay.  Waitress must have been alerted as she shows up several minutes later.  We sort out the drink.  We wait.  Table next to us now has entrees (remember they sat after we did, by at least 10 minutes).  Finally food shows up, appetizer arrives with the entrees...  but at least we have food.  Food is brought by server other than our waitress.  He points out the cute little jars of butter and spiced apple butter with biscuits.  I ask for jam.  He says there is none, they only have the apple butter.  I say, but the menu says biscuits are served with butter and jam.  He says ""Apple butter IS jam.""  And he walks away.  No, apple butter is not jam and that nasty spiced stuff would have ruined these excellent biscuits, so we ate them with only butter, until that ran out.  We would have asked for more if we'd ever seen our waitress.  Sigh.  She finally shows up once, halfway thru meal, and asks if I want a refill on my empty cup of coffee which has been empty for, I don't know, 10 minutes?  15?  Yeah, that would be awesome.  I get one refill, but never get another.  Did I mention the cup of coffee was $5?  And that it was a tiny cup and saucer type cup, the kind that holds about 6 ounces?  Yes, FIVE DOLLARS for a cup of coffee with one grudging refill.  And my complaint isn't the cost - this is Vegas, I'm perfectly happy to pay for the coffee, but I should have been offered refills.  Even if they cost more, fine, just give me to option to have coffee during my whole meal!  The coffee I did have was good.  Like I said at the beginning, the FOOD was good.  I had the kale salad and hubby had the biscuits and gravy special, and we shared the Classic biscuits.  Very tasty.  We cleaned our plates.  Which is good because we then had to look at them for 15+ minutes.  Sitting there, staring at our empty plates and wondering if we should just walk out.  I could see our waitress spending a lot of time a table for 6 by the kitchen.  The rest of the time she was invisible.  Either way, she ignored us.  So did all the bus persons and other waitstaff.  The table next to us?  Long gone.  Sadly, part of what attracted me to this restaurant in the first place was the desserts.  I really wanted to try a couple.  But by the time our waitress finally wandered over and picked up our plates, I was visibly annoyed.  Did she apologize or acknowledge in any way?  Nope.  Did she ask if we wanted dessert?  NOPE.  She picked up our plates and walked away with no mention of dessert, then brought us our check with a pen that literally did not work as it was out of ink, and she left.  Never asked if we liked the food, or how we were, nothing.  I couldn't even flag anyone else down for a working pen, we had to take our check to the front and get a pen to sign the check.  Normally I would attach photos of the food and decor, but I'm showing the reality of our experience.  Which really sucks because with halfway decent service, this would have been a great meal.  I would even go back, if I could be guaranteed better service.  I hope management sees this review and that's why I'm attaching a photo of the check with the server's name and number.",9p1K50Uzn3Cl0wagIkFGNA,0,0,1,c7uIvC5X9b4wAxhv8iUfrw

No flavor at all. My friend had the BBQ biscuits and was in love with their biscuits, but not the BBQ. Also, FYI, we asked about the winner of Hell's Kitchen and were told she's coming in about a week. I know they shot like 2 years ago, so I wonder where she's been since then...

The atmosphere had dimmed lighting which is perfect for food and conversation. Our sever was so friendly as he recommended items for us.

We went with an order of Mac & Cheese which consisted of torchio pasta, five artisan cheeses topped with a crispy herb crust. We wanted a side of fresh farm scrambled eggs and the famous Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. OH MY was the food delicious. The Mac & Cheese did not make you full to the point where you don't want to eat. The consistency of the cheese was perfect, each bite was creamy in your mouth.

The food dishes ordered:

- CHICKEN 'N' WATERMELON 'N' WAFFLES: Each bite of the chicken was so juicy and tender, even to the core. I'm always disappointed when the chicken is dry or when it gets drier and more chewy/bland as I get to the center, but Yardbird somehow manages to cook their chicken in a way where every bite is just as delicious as the first. The chilled spiced watermelon was delicious and now I'm going to be dipping my watermelon into spices because of Yardbird. The waffles were crisp on the outside and soft in the inside and delicious, as well. 

- BRUSSEL SPROUTS: This was so delicious I don't think any other brussel sprouts I eat will be the same. It was just the amount of crispiness and saltiness without being too overbearing. Also, I've had bitter tasting brussel sprouts at famous restaurants, which I am not a fan of. Somehow, Yardbird was able to make this dish taste so amazing that I was tempted to order another plate. 

- FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT: Oh my goodness, Yardbird. You are killing me. This dish was mouth-watering delicious. The combination of flavors complemented each other so well, I had to take a moment to really appreciate it in its entirety after the first bite. I was almost sad to take a second bite because it was disappearing way too fast. I will definitely be ordering this dish every time I come back to Vegas. 

Better yet, why can't you just open a branch in L. A., Yardbird? I promise to give you lots of business.

We shared the crispy chicken biscuits. Absolutely delicious. My wife then had the low and slow smoked chicken salad. She said that it was very very good. I had the blue plate special, as the chicken is known to be the star. It came with a biscuit and chilled spiced watermelon. I have to say that the watermelon mostly just tasted like watermelon, but you could tell it had a little spice to it. The chicken was so good that I abandoned trying to eat it with a fork. It was probably the best fried chicken that I've ever had. 

What really put this place over the top with us was the fact that our maitre d asked why we were in Vegas. I assumed just as small talk, I mentioned that the next day was our anniversary. The waiter, later in the service, asked us about our anniversary. Even though we told him not to make and kind of a deal out of it, he insisted on bringing us some champagne and didn't mention anything.

The service was good until the very end. We had a hard time getting our servers attention....I could see him standing at the register near the kitchen talking and laughing with someone for a long time which was annoying. 

We had:
The deviled eggs - standard tasting with the added trout roe making them pop a little. Without that though, kind of basic.

Chicken and Waffle - Really good, probably the best thing on the table that day. I didn't enjoy the melon on the side, it had a taste to it that for me didn't go with anything. The chicken was excellent and the waffle was good. I expected to taste the cheese a bit more but the hot sauce with the chicken and the syrup with the waffle were great.

The sausage biscuit - Its just that, On a plate and pretty awkward to eat because it was so large. 

The shrimp and grits - This was a great choice. Small bowl of grits with 6 shrimp placed around the top. Nice light meal.

The mimosa - very small, not very strong. Order something else.


All in all not a bad stop, just not wowed by the food considering the cost. I was also disappointed in our server after the food was delivered. (by someone else) I feel like he was just trying to collect a tip on a high costing ticket, the service at Denny's was a bit more attentive.",Sp21fVzCSd1p540qkWuUeQ,0,0,3,pXOrE7czZwnCHPSodKCvrQ

1487439,2016-10-19,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"This was, by far one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. 

Let me preface this by explaining that we were in Vegas for a birthday (we are all in our 30s, and wanted to have some nice dinners out), and because we had a party of SEVEN people (one more than they allow for an Open Table reservation), I was required to email a coordinator, sign a contract, agreed to a minimum per person that will be spent, and then put down a $150 non refundable deposit. For seven people. I get it for 10 or more, but there are MORE than enough tables in that restaurant to accommodate 8 people.

I have also eaten at the Miami Yardbird and had an incredible experience -- from food to service. That was also for a birthday, and we were comped dessert (with candle) and glasses of champagne. That was why we went with the contract/minimum nonsense for the Vegas location (despite the fact that we seamlessly made a reservation at the much applauded Bazaar Meats for EIGHT people and had on of the most exceptional dining experiences ever).

First of all, we arrived on time (actually, early by 10) minutes for our reservation and they weren't ready for us, but seated us at some sofas at the bar. As we were starving, and our table was nowhere near getting ready, we asked for two appetizers with our drinks, but the waitress told us, no, we should just wait for our table to order food, and basically denied our food order... so now we're still waiting (because the table we were waiting on STILL hadn't left -- by the way, the host said ""there's another table in the back, but I'm going to seat you out here"" without even giving us the choice) and we're beyond hungry. He was nice enough to get us a round of shots, but frankly we would have preferred food.

Finally we get to the table, and the waiter from the start is lackluster. He barely spoke to us, didn't explain the menu (only two of us had dined at Yardbird -- in Miami -- before) and basically left as quickly as he'd arrived to take care of other tables. We finally ordered, and when the food arrived, he'd forgotten to put in my ENTIRE order. Just mine. My whole table ordered food, and only mine was left out. This was the first time I had to speak to the manager, Scott, about the issue. He was understanding and offered to take care of something off our bill (great). I assumed it would be my meal, as that was what was completely ruined and poorly handled. So at this point, I returned to the table.

When my food finally did come -- shrimp and grits -- it was pretty much inedible. Gummy, slimy, not at all appetizing. Another friend got the same thing and we both barely touched it. At NO POINT, did our waiter ever RETURN to the table to ask how the food was. Instead some bus boy came over and TOOK OUR FULL PLATES AWAY without even a question as to WHY we hadn't eaten.

So now we get the bill. Scott had taken off one or two drinks and a SINGLE order of side Mac and Cheese (we'd ordered three total). I was honestly appalled. So at this point, I went to speak with him again, explaining my continued frustration. Not only had we had poor service, but the restitution of the poor service had been badly handled.

This was lackluster -- and I think that's being gracious. The food was disappointing (at least four people in our party barely touched their entrees because they were either overcooked or cold) and the service was absolutely deplorable. Scott was great, in the end, but that was the one redeeming factor.",CucIwID-c_WBIiyGScwIdA,2,0,2,3nVlTkEUYc3huAKEweg98w

Shirley temple - strange taste. The server said it was a in-house grenadine that makes the taste different. Thumbs down.

Chocolate Nutella cake - YES!!!!! So good. Not too rich, moist, and just plain scrumptious.

Corn bread - not amazing, but probably one of the better corn breads I've tasted.

Chicken and waffles - had a taste. As good as chicken and waffles can be. 

Blackberry bourbon lemonade - had a sip. Pretty good... refreshing. I could DEFINITELY taste the alcohol.

We got drinks with our orders and my blackberry bouton lemonade was just what I needed. It came out in a mason jar and I loved the balance of the tea and bourbon.

My boyfriend and I ordered the deviled eggs, chilled watermelon with pepper, lemon and herbs, mama's biscuits (fried chicken, pepper jelly, pickles, and buttermilk biscuits), and the crunchy yardbird sandwich (fried chicken, bacon, buttermilk dressing with tomato and lettuce). They are famous for their fried chicken and OMG it was really amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about the food we had.

The fried chicken was crispy on the outside but still juicy and moist on the inside, the biscuits and jelly just made it even better. I took a bite of my bf's sandwich and had to agree with his great choice. The deviled eggs were stacked! It was huge and roped with fish roe. Nice touch!

1501401,2018-06-03,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"The food was incredible but unfortunately, we experienced some of the worst service we have ever experienced by a waiter. When we were seated, Howard our waiter, seemed uninterested and was looking through his wallet while telling us about the menu. He then left and came back 15-20 minutes later to take our orders. We ordered the chicken and waffles, the ceasar salad with smoked chicken and a side of coleslaw. The food came out very quickly and we really enjoyed it. Howard (our server) came to the tables around us and asked how their food was but never once stopped to check in with us. We waited another 10-15 minutes after we had finished eating for him to come and ask us if we wanted dessert, still no questions from him about how our meal was. We declined dessert as we honestly just wanted to leave because we were so uncomfortable with how rude he was. It was probably another 10 minute wait for us to get our checks and he did not say a SINGLE WORD to us. He just handed us our bills and that was it. It was such a strange and sad experience. I would expect a restaurant with such incredible (and slightly pricey) food to have service that matched. It definitely ruined our experience and we will not be returning.

Update:
After being contacted about our experience by management, I wanted to give it another try so I went back for lunch. It was such a different experience! Everyone I encountered was so friendly and the service was incredible. I had the butter lettuce salad with grilled mango and smoked chicken and had the butterscotch cake for dessert. The cake was one of the most incredible desserts I have ever had! For $12, it is a great value as the piece is huge. I could barely eat half of it. It seems as though we may have just had bad luck and came on an off night.

Went on a Saturday night so expected a crowd. Prices really reasonable on food. Now for the reason for the 2 star vs a 4-5 star.  We were a party of ten and booked a reservation. Due to size of party we had to put a $150 deposit down. Little odd as we have gone to many nicer Vegas restaurants with large party and have not had to do this but ok we knew we were not going to cancel so not a huge deal. We were also told that we had a minimum spend of 650.  Again not our usual experience with nice Vegas restaurants.  Also could only be at table for 2 hours max.  We had apps, cocktails, entrees and desserts in attempt to ensure we hit our spend.  Check came at end of meal and was not itemized at all. We had to ask for details.  Once we got itemized total we saw that we were short by $140.  Wait staff gave us no indication of how much we were off they were just going to charge us whatever $$$ amount to hit $650.  Once we pointed that out we all ordered  drinks to go to at least get something for our money.  The bill also had a $32 administrative fee not even sure what that was for as tip was not included.  Overall very poor experience and we will not be back due to it.  We come to Vegas at least once a year with larger groups and are happy to spend well over the 650 minimum for a great dinner experience so price is not an issue.

We stopped for a late night snack, spent $100 , left feeling so disappointed I wish I had talked to the manager.  The staff seemed more interested in closing / recovery duties than helping customers.

So the kicker, ordered too much food, want to take it to my room for later.  Ask for some bread, since you know my ""BLT"" didn't have any, deconstructed etc.  Offered biscuits, to which I say I'll take two.  Get to the room later and notice that they charged $3.00 a piece for biscuits.  Yep, six bucks.  Now I'm thinking these are gonna be some great biscuits, Nope, small, HARD as a rock and tough.  To top it off, NO BUTTER.  Dry as the desert Vegas is built on and not a drop of butter to help you along.  Just for reference, The mega Giant KFC offers biscuits for about a quarter the price and 20 times the taste.  So sad, shame on you Yardbird.

I got to taste the shrimp and grits, eggs benedict, fried chicken, and the biscuits with gravy. Everything was DELICIOUS. I loved the spin that they put on every dish, and although Im not a fan of typical American style brunch food (so boring and generic), Yardbird was unique and delicious. The food here is very heavy though, so just be ready for that. 

The shrimp and grits gave 6 big shrimps, and the grits were the least gritty that I have every had. They were very smooth and creamy... I struggled to eat more than half the portion.

The eggs benedict were also special, because the poached eggs were over their biscuits... AND they gave a piece of fried chicken with it. 

The special of the day - fried chicken over a biscuit with gravy and an egg on top - all of my friends who ordered this devoured it in silence in about 5 minutes. It was just THAT good. The small piece of chicken I got to taste was very juicy and just melted.

Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit for brunch. I would pick it over Bouchon (in the same hotel) anyday if you are in the area.",D7IONMrpSX9PuJdelvAWVA,1,1,5,XBCMJc4CiiOCRYR5p6ngrw

The food and atmosphere was outstanding however the food can always be good but the service is what makes the experience.  Hatch was our server.  He grew up in Louisville and had a colorful life that we briefly discussed but bottom line he made me feel like I was back home.

On their recommendation we ordered the fried green tomatoes. AMAZING!!! Then we split the short ribs and fried chicken. BEST DECISION EVER!!! The meal was worth the atmosphere, and was worth every Vegas penny. Will for sure go back again.

I was extremely excited before coming because of the pictures others have posted. Then, on the way to Vegas a friend who was just there a week before I was mentioned Yardbird, I told her I was way ahead of her and had reservations already. That got me more excited!

Now for the actual review, we ordered the deviled eggs, chicken n' watermelon n' waffles, shrimp and grits, mac n cheese and the bone marrow.

Deviled eggs: Bleh, it was mediocre. I was expecting deliciousness.

Chicken n' watermelon n' waffles: My favorite! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried, juicy and delicious.

Shrimp and grits: tasty, I wasnt a big fan, but my husband was. I thought they put too much sauce and it masked the natural flavors of the shrimp and grits. 

Mac n cheese: its mac n cheese, good flavors and very cheesy!!

Bone marrow: DELICIOUS!!!! This was actually my favorite. I probably can eat 3 orders of this. Yummy, delicious fatty marrow on perfectly toasted bread and that jam. Mmm!!

We came back for lunch two days later and ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich, perfectly seasoned and filling.

Yes the fried chicken was really good but after than it was just crappy.  I ordered the wedge salad as a side, it arrived almost frozen with guacamole mounded on the top.  Then the total WORST dressing.  I tried to get sides like butter beans, mustard greens, and etc but they don't have them.  The server asked how the food was and I told them the chicken was great but the salad was not even close to southern or was worth serving.  Then you get the bill..........a chicken breast and thigh with nothing else was $18.00

My total bill was $40 for 2 pieces of chicken, a crappy wedge and guacamole salad and ice tea!

-We came here on a Friday night for dinner with reservations and we quickly got seated near the back where the chefs were cooking.  The menu was easy to read and gave a lot of options (drink menu was aplenty).  We ordered the Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles dish with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon (a little spicy), cheddar cheese waffle, and bourbon maple syrup (you can really taste the alcohol!).  This is what they recommended and what we wanted to try.  We had two big pieces and two small pieces of chicken with maybe six cubes of watermelon and two waffles.  The taste was good, juicy, soft, and flavorful.  I would definitely come back here again for the chicken but not order this dish (watermelon and waffles). Our friend just ordered Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (1/2 a bird with honey hot sauce) and it was only $26. The waffles were only okay but the bourbon maple syrup was really good, and very different.  
-Aside, we had the skillet corn bread with cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, and maple butter.  This was also just okay.  It didn't taste fresh, and I did not taste much bacon in it.  I also tasted the mac and cheese which a lot of people talk about on yelp and my opinion is that it is delicious! I would order this again.

Improvements:
-Waffles had a very bland taste to it.  This was not my favorite. 
-Don't order the corn bread.

Tips:
-CC and Cash accepted, they can split bills for you.

I frequent vegas on the regular a few times a year. And yardbird is a must visit every time i come. The food is stellar. The service top notch. And it really boils down to authentic southern homestyle cooking. Every person i have brought here raves about the restaurant and quite often i find myself here twice even on short stays.

Theres nothing quite like the chicken and waffles here. Good for 2 people it really is a feast of sweet and savoury. The chicken is crispy and juicy in every bite. The waffles filled with cheese and herbs pair lovely with spicy watermelon snd maple syrup. You must try this!!! Share it with someone so you can get the bisquits and gravy. Pictures dont do it justice. Just get them! The cocktails are great as well. Everything i have had on the menu is stellar. 

One of my favourite eateries on the strip. And THE best of venetian/palazzo restaurants. Located on restaurant row its perfect post hangover for the munchies or even a fine dining/casual experience out. The atmosphere is modern, comfortable with a touch of class. Plus they have a special brunch menu on weekends. And also pack to go orders nicely to bring to your room or the pool at your leisure. Never pretentious. Child friendly.

The manager then said that they can cook my friends chicken separate in different oil but would take a little longer. We were fine with that because we specifically went for their fried chicken. The manager and waitress went out of their way to make sure we were happy even brought us a complimentary cocktail. Now that's service! They could of just said sorry you have to order something else but they didn't. By the way the fried chicken and fried green tomatoes were amazing!

""Um, yes ... just yesterday actually.""

That, my friends, is what a Yardbird fried chicken addiction sounds like. After sinking my teeth into the crisp and juicy 27-hour fried chicken, there was no going back. Out the window went my plans to try out epic Vegas buffets and posh restaurants. All I wanted was my Yardbird chicken fix.

We went to Yardbird twice during our trip to Vegas, and the only reason there weren't any more was because we flew out soon after our second visit. Everything we ate was ridiculously delicious. We ordered a wedge salad with minimal expectations but were soon singing our server praises. The lettuce had that perfect crunch, the hunks of bacon were substantial and tasty, and the avocado slices, cherry tomatoes and corn added layers of flavor I'd never experienced in a humble wedge salad. We also tried the brisket biscuits: fluffy and tasty biscuits overflowing with juicy and flavorful slices of brisket. The superstar is, of course, the fried chicken with cheddar waffles and chilled spiced watermelon. What an addictive interplay of delicious flavors, textures and temperatures! Quite possibly the best chicken and waffles I've ever had, period. On a separate visit, we had just the chicken so we could try other dishes and they hold up perfectly well on their own, too. For dessert, we had banana pudding, which was quite impressive and very tasty. I do regret not ordering their peach crumble (it takes 25 minutes to make so order ahead if that's your jam), but that just gives me a reason to come back. Service is excellent; the servers are very attentive, have great recommendations and always kept our coffee cups full. I thought the cocktails were just okay ... great variety but to me, they didn't seem so strong. I'd say save the stomach space and $$$ for more of that brilliant fried chicken! Praying to all the little cherubs in heaven that Yardbird opens soon in New York. Til then, I'll have to check out Root and Bone and see how it stacks up!",vy3BO-jg1xDTePVyuPCfUw,0,0,5,R2yuGUpe_QZ0b4ltyeyTBA

Shrimp n'Grits with crisp Virginia ham - spot-on shrimp and grits. Juicy shrimp, super flavorful grits. Can't go wrong.

Restaurant is located just outside of the Venetian casino not too hard to find.

We ordered the deviled eggs and the chicken waffle watermelon to share.
The portions are huge!! And their dishes are definitely meant for sharing.

The deviled eggs were so good.. They top it up with caviars- and the plate comes with 4 pieces
The chicken waffle watermelon has 5 pieces of chicken and 2 big pieces of waffles and watermelons and i must say the waffles are super tastey !! Their syrup for the waffle is quite different but good ! Chicken pieces are soo moist- Yardbird is famous for their chicken so definitely must try!

Our waiter, terrible I can't remember his name, was fantastic. Knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, and efficient. He pressed us a little too hard to get a second appetizer, but we prevailed!

What we ordered:

Smoked and Roasted Bone Marrow - Meaty gelatinous goodness best describes this dish. Served with onion jam that paired perfectly with it and toasted country bread. 

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles - Best fried chicken I have ever had. They pride themselves on brining the chicken for 27 hours and boy does that patience pay off. Chicken was deliciously tender with the perfect crispy coating. Chicken paired beautifully with the Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup and honey hot sauce. An incredible combination. The spiced watermelon had a little kick and was super refreshing.

Peach Cobbler - They require 25 minutes notice to prepare the cobbler and I would have gladly waited another hour for it. This cobbler had a marzipan crumble on top with french vanilla ice cream in an almond cookie bowl served with a cinnamon twist. I may have already been full but I stuffed as much of this in my mouth as I could.

I rarely rave about restaurants, but I do about this one. The boyfriend felt the need to proclaim this not only to the waiter but also to the manager, much to my muted embarrassment. Yardbird needs to come to Detroit for real.",G6Xq6CS7D5NknHPooAtyaQ,2,4,5,LkHtGGtoYl4xx_iUEpc37g
1735919,2016-01-10,20,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Southern food with an upscale ambiance.

Maybe it's just me but I prefer Southern restaurants to feel more traditional without all the fancy touches. I like silverware & furniture not matching and the food to be simple and full of flavor. I've been here twice now and there's always something that's off.

The food is ok but nothing blew me away. When the prices are high which is expected on the strip the food needs to shine in my opinion. There's so many Southern options in town for half the price and they taste better. The restaurant is very pretty and has a modern feel with some traditional touches which isn't anything special and the service has been spotty to say the least. 

My favorite items were the chicken & waffles but the watermelon it comes with has never been in season during my visits and still comes on the plate. Look for another option when the watermelon doesn't taste good. The deviled eggs have always been luxurious and creamy and the chicken biscuit sandwich has been a winner when the biscuit isn't burnt. 

So there's tasty things but sometimes it doesn't all come together. As for some of the other items that were bland for me ~ mac & cheese, fried green tomatoes, shrimp & grits, warm cheese on watermelon (bad luck with the fruit). The cocktails here are also a tad too fancy and come with massive ice cubes that leave hardly any room for the good stuff - the liquor. 

So all in all, it's pricey for what it is. It's very fancy which isn't needed and some of the food needs some work. I like simplicity when it comes to Southern cuisine and I think things could get better here.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,35,34,3,SF3ydIhaLMpwXoRVugN64g

I say, ""take sushi and shove it,"" so you can imagine how hard it is for me to find favorite restaurants in what seems like an interminable land of sushi joints. All that to say I was completely onboard with Yardbird's concept going in to the visit.

My friends and I tried brunch here. They were out of champagne... On a Friday... Of a holiday weekend. How does that work?! Fine. I'll have coffee instead. It was very good coffee, worth both stars I've given the place. The bacon maple donuts were good too. The cornbread was ok. Eggs Benedict was ok. The sweet tea tasted like something you'd by in a can from 7/11. The server was nice. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Yardbird. I think they may be trying to make southern food ""hip"" for the masses who have sushi and ""trend"" addictions (i.e. Most Californians) who don't understand how amazing good old southern cooking is if it's left unfussy.

Service is so friendly! Carrie (spelling?) was so nice and peppy, and helped us decide that we wanted to have our dinner family style and share everything! She was very sociable and asked more about us!

Everyone constantly came around to keep our waters filled. I squeezed some lemon into my water and it was really refreshing to drink with my meal!

The manager came to check in with our food  at one point :)",nQjG8KR_XI3dh_tjwNwDkw,1,1,5,N3xzKFqI4JnmzhhDQ304Tg

Yardbird Restaurant is literally next door to the venue, so nothing could be more convenient. Plus they honored all reservation which is a major plus. ( the people who walked in in front of us without a reservation were told to come back in 3 hours !) We decided to share their Skillet cornbread, grilled Caesar salad, and the signature Fried Chicken. The cornbread was by far the best cornbread I've ever eaten. It comes out with a honey butter in the center. Yumm! Grilled Caesar salad he's just what it sounds like. It's a grilled Romaine that split in half and has delicious toppings on it. Absolutely delicious. The fried chicken is their signature dish. That was a little disappointing. But in the spirit of full disclosure, I am not ordinarily a fan of fried chicken. This version of it did nothing to convert me. Their dessert menu looked phenomenal. Unfortunately I was way too stuffed by that time to order another dish. Next time I come back, I'll skip the chicken and go straight to dessert. The only drawback to Yardbird is the closeness of the tables. The tables for two were lined up maybe 6 inches apart from each other. We were lucky that the folks eating on either side of us were friendly and not too loud.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,0,4,KH_3JfKAJesF-tdjRx31Zg

We were inspired by the savory brunch and four-star rating to check out Yardbird. We made reservations with a welcoming hostesses, greeted with smiles at the door and served by a well-informed waiter. 

We ordered chicken-waffles-watermelon, shrimp and grits, biscuits, the farmers cheese, and a bourbon cocktail. Plenty of leftovers for two. The farmers cheese is lightly grilled and served on a thin slice of watermelon... Delicate and lovely. The biscuits are light and flakey, but substantial... They're jam and bourbon-butter are phenomenal! Checked and waffles are a standard of southern food and Yardbird doesn't skip a beat and, while your heart might with the generous helpings of bourbon-syrup, both the waffles and chicken are crisp and savory. Lastly our grits were served smoother than most recipes, layered on a savory roux and topped with sautéed peppers and little strips of bacon.

What an awesome happening. First of all, this review is LONG overdue. Our bartender was amazing, friendly, and used to own a restaurant in San Jose. I apologize for forgetting your name, because you made our experience phenomenal. 

First of all, they have Roderer champagne as their ""well"" or basic champagne. Score. It's my favorite. 

Second, their chicken is incredible. I was asked how it compares to Thomas Keller's. That's a tough comparison, but Yardbird is certainly up there. We returned for brunch and were thoroughly impressed with the chicken and waffles, the cocktails, and the service.

In a sea of high priced food, Yardbird stands out as a place that's worth your dollar.

The fried green tomatoBLT was perfectly fried and breaded with house smoked pork belly (aka BACON) and pimento cheese. There is a reason this appetizer is so popular! Lives up to the expectations and definitely one of the best I've had. The chicken and waffles were tender and fresh. The watermelon served with it is spiced and the perfect palate cleanser in between each bite. The honey hot sauce isn't even really needed because the flavors are already so good. The peppered gnocchi pot pie with mushroom and sage was creamy heaven. There's a soft biscuit on top and one at the bottom that has sopped up the creamy goodness. The shrimp and grits were delicious because there was also Virginia ham involved. The service was outstanding. We had a very enthusiastic fella from Kentucky that was so passionate about the food and held true to his word on the recommendations. The ambience was warm and inviting and wasn't even too loud even though it was busy. I will be back the next chance I get because the LA location may be too long for me to wait for.

THE GOOD
Decor/Ambience- the restaurant featured walls of distressed, repurposed wood with a gorgeous series of mason jar chandeliers in the dining area. There was also a series of pictures projected on the wall of rock and roll and jazz greats from the South (Elvis, Johnny Cash etc)
Customer Service- Now apart from our waiter being stunningly handsome  (Nick). He was attentive, respectful and gave great recommendations. It was Southern hospitality and charm all around.
The Best Part- Loved the food!! Whoever drines ans seasoned that chicken should be kissed. It was crunchy, juicy and flavorful. The spiced watermelon was a nice addition as well. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the dried Okra.The shrimp and Grits were heavenly 

THE NOT SO GOOD
I hated that the portions were so small. Come on YardBird, when the food tastes that good... why skimp on the portions???

1834296,2015-02-16,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"REVIEW 2 OF 2
We liked it so much that around dark thirty, which is an accurate time in Vegas, we came back and were immediately sat back down in the dining room, were Sarah, with an ""h,"" was tasked with reviving and hydrating our band of Merry Men.  She brought her own style of sassiness, and did not disappoint!  Without much of a surprise, we had Old Fashioneds, and this time started with Llewellyn's Chicken, which is the same center piece we started with last time minus the waffles and watermelon.  Perfect Execution the second time around, and even though my wife hates it, I could not help to lick my fingers for every last morsel and flavor I could get.  We happened to see Andy there, and he came charging over to say hi and to ask if we would play a quick joke on his Bar Manager, Michael.  Let's just say that it involved cupcakes and another ""member,"" and that the joke went over well, and was a .....pun intended......ice breaker with Michael.  This guy has a passion, and it is noticeable.  He returns to the restaurant scene after spending time in personal finance or investing, if I remember correctly and adds ammunition that you need to chase your passion.  His bar is amazing, the infusions unique, and the cocktails carefully selected and calibrated for certain flavor profiles.  What sets him apart is not only the attention to the drinks, but to the whole drinking experience.  I have never seen an ice program in a bar like this.  This guy is hand pressing spheres from large ice slabs and uses some serious Japanese tools to hack at the behemoth blocks of ice.   I am sad that I won't be there for St. Patrick's and see his ice clover creation, but recommend everyone in town to get there!!!  Bottom Line, Mike is awesome, his bar is great, and his is doing a heck of a job over there.
Next, Sarah brought out the Steak Tartare, which is covered in a BBQ sauce sorbet.....awesome....and the intended vessel for consumption is a fried rectangle of cornbread......AWESOME.  You mix in the Sorbet, to chill down and evenly spread the BBQ within the Tartare, and the fried cornbread acted as intended and we happily shoveled it into our cake holes!
After Beef, came the other white meat, Fried Frog Legs that are served with sweet and sour jelly, bacon bits and a house made escabeche mayo.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  They were served with an order of the buttermilk biscuits, and let me tell you.....hailing from Texas but now living in San Diego, buttermilk biscuits are an art, and this art is not found very easily outside of the Southern States.......these guys nailed it.  Small jars of honey butter and seasonal house jam added the right amount of sweet and velvet to the biscuits that could stand on their own!
They surprised my wife and me with a massive wedge of cake that was described as bacon butterscotch cake.  It was filled with pecan pie filling, covered with bits of bacon and served with Bourbon Flavored Ice cream..NUFF SAID!
We had a round of Patron XO layered with Baileys, and I had a Macchiato, and then we went over to personally thank Mike, Sarah, and Andy for making the experience memorable not once, but twice in a 12 hour period.
Sarah did a great job with us, took all our jokes in stride, had a zang for every zing and made sure that we had a pleasurable dining experience.  Andy, who we found out is from location #1 in Florida is out in Vegas making sure that the staff understand s what the owners/creators intended and he doing a heck of a job.  I think Andy has a bright future at YardBird's and we wish him success.  Look, I know food and spirit, but you don't have to be an expert to get this place.  The intention is to serve high quality creative food and drink without being pretentious, and they have nailed it.  In 2015, you don't need white table clothes to get award worthy food, and that is the beauty of the revolution that we all get to experience firsthand.  Someone that has 0 experience or expectations would have the same awesome time here, and would NEVER feel out of place or unworthy! We were sharing pictures of our kids with Mike, joking with Andy and Sarah, like we had known them for years, but at the same time were drinking world class cocktails and eating steak tartare that was covered in a BBQ sauce Sorbet.  If the intention is excellence and elegance with being pretentious, these guys are spot on. 
Overall, this place gets 4.5 out 5 stars and not because they slipped at all, but we all must pursue perfection and always strive to be better.  We can't have it handed to us and risk getting lazy and uncreative, because if that happens we will find ourselves back into a culinary dark age, where faceless chains will multiply and divide like cell mitosis and we will be back to pre-made frozen food and sauces being schlepped to the masses.  Let's not let this happen and lets support Yardbirds and her sister creators nationwide!",bDo7NpAyCyEnMZBBI0bLeQ,2,2,5,834Tzr-jvcDCvj7c4ZB4ew

It was pretty over whelming having so much carbs. But for the chicken, it was delicious!!! I would def come back and just order a bucket of it and eat it with hot sauce. The chicken was so crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The egg Benedict was just okay. Nothing special. About the brisket, don't get it! I thought it was so average. I was pretty impress with customer services there. Our waiter and one of the manager was so accommodating. He offered us a round of shots or desserts bc it was my friend bday.

1840357,2015-03-31,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"We decided not to read the reviews and just order whatever we felt like. 

One point off - The restaurant was way too loud, hubby and I had to lean over to each other's ears to have a conversation, which was not a bad thing btw lol. It was quite dim, we were seated at a high booth which was a bit tight with another table next to us. I am quite petite and found it difficult to get in and out between the two tables. 

The appetizers appealed to us more so we ended ordering five.
1. Fried Frog legs - yummy! It was served with sweet and sour jelly, and some bacon bits. Crispy just like chicken. :)
2. Fried Green Tomato BLT - served with a piece of crispy pork belly, a special pimento cheese mixture that tasted like mayo, all on top of the thickly sliced bread crumb fried tomato
3. Manchester Quail under a brick - The quail was delicious, soft and tender, even had a piece of liver. The green farrow was flavorful but be warned that the presentation does not look appealing ;)
4. Mama's Chicken Biscuit - the same chicken that's marinated for 27 hours but served with a biscuit. I love the house pickles that came with it. I wish I knew the secret recipe for the pickles. The chicken was very good but nothing that I never had before. 
5. Pork Belly - A piece of crispy sweet tender pork belly on a pickled relish with some hot sweet jelly. So delicious! 

Drinks:
1. Yardbird Old Fashioned - bacon infused Buffalo Trace Bourbon. Anything with bacon is yum! Very, very, very strong!
2. Southern Peach - Love the peach puree although couldn't taste much of the tea.

Service was excellent, Howard was all smiles, super friendly and cute lol.

We were particularly obsessed with the Mac and cheese. One of the best I've every had from a restaurant. The Virginia ham biscuits were also amazing. And the combination of sweet, salty, and spicy in the fried chicken biscuits with pepper jelly was to die for.

I ordered the mac and cheese and the fried chicken biscuit.  The mac and cheese is super creamy and decently flavourful but it's a bit too much.  The chicken was well cooked and solidly tasty but definitely not crispy, which is fine in this application but considering all the fried chicken is done the same,  would be disappointing by itself.

We had the Fried Chicken and Waffles. And they were the BEST fried chicken and waffles I have EVER had! It was a generous portion (well it better be, for $36..), big enough for two people to share. The fried chicken was SO flavourful I did not even need the sauce that came with it. The waffles were a jalapeno cheddar waffle that was once again, good enough to eat by itself, although it came with a side of maple syrup and hot sauce. There were some cubes of watermelon on the side, drenched in hot sauce. Great combination! The fresh cold watermelon was a really good complement to cut the rich taste from the chicken and waffle. This entire plate was such a FLAVOURBOMB! 

We also had some okra on the side. It was good, but not as phenomenal as the fried chicken and waffles.

We tried two cocktails - one blueberry bourbon, and the other was a watermelon cocktail. Both were good, but the food outshone the drinks.

1893066,2015-06-21,4,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird is relatively new to the Venetian, specializing in fried chicken and other southern goodies. Prices are reasonable, and most portions are meant to be shared between 2-4 people. I dig the large mason jar lighting fixture in the main dining room, and the overall modern-farmhouse theme.

DEVILED EGGS: A simple hit, classic dish with fun presentation. Trout roe is a nice touch, portion of four egg halves is $10.
FARMERS SALAD: There's another hardboiled egg here among the greens, along with a parmesan crisp and a Vidalia onion vinaigrette. Definitely order at least one salad if you're sharing entrees as a group, to balance out the heavier, greasier dishes.
SMOKED BRISKET SANDWICH: An interesting take with pickled veggies, and melted swiss but minimal, understated barbecue sauce. Not a favorite at the table, though it was loaded up with plenty of meat.
CHILLED WATERMELON: Fun jenga-style presentation but underwhelming flavors. Seasoning was too subtle and what was there was unbalanced and not complementary to the natural sweetness of the fruit.
SHRIMP & GRITS: Easily the best dish at the table, with an ample, saucy portion of Nora Mill Granary grits topped with chopped Virginia ham and perfectly-cooked Florida shrimp. There wasn't a drop of this left.
LLEWELYN'S FINE FRIED CHICKEN: Mixed feelings around the table about this. Thin batter, crispy skin, moist meat, but it didn't really wow anyone. We couldn't put our finger on why. Lacked the crunch and flavor expected for Southern-style chicken. Wasn't bad, just wasn't particularly good, either.

 Wish I'd had room to try the Fried Green Tomato BLT or the mac and cheese, but our meal was rich enough already without those dishes. Overall, more misses than hits here.

This is acutally located in the walkway between Venetian and Palazzo. . .but since I knew the Palazzo parking better I parked there and walked.  It was not that bad of a walk.  =)

The ambiance was nice. . .it was a little crowed though. . .and the sitting parts of the restaurant were kind of hard to see as the bar and lounge area are at the entrance.  So it was kind of hard to find my friend that I was meeting there.  

I'm going to start with the bad and end with the good. . .Desserts were subpar.  Very disappointing.  =(  The ice cream was creamy but the flavor was very lacking and honestly nothing in the dessert stood out. . .it was just blah as in I could have probably gotten something better at my neighborhood ice cream shop.  =(

Dinner was pretty good. . .We had the chicken and waffles and it was pretty decent.  Was it to the style of true southern fried chicken or Roscoe's. . .no. . .but for being in Vegas in a Casino. . .it was pretty good.  The watermelon that accompanied this dish was not that great.  they had compressed it in a sous vide machine and the texture that I was looking for in the watermelon was weird.  The mustard sauce that accompanied it was better their house hot sauce.  (3/5)

We also had the BLT with the pork belly and fried green tomatoes!  This was actually really good!  The fried green tomatoes were crispy and just perfectly fried.  The pork belly was tender and flavorful.  Out of everything that I had this was the best part of the meal and yet it was only (4/5)

Would I come back. . .maybe if someone else wanted to try it. . .but will I be coming back just to eat here again. . .most likely. . .no.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,4,2,3,BN4O5TaOCSAE2s0RCArOJg

She said she would text me is when our table was ready and after we asked when our table was ready they told us they were ready and even after they sat us we never got a text. 
    In regard to the food it was outstanding. I ordered the 1/2 chicken and we got a side of classic biscuits, fries, and macaroni and cheese for an appetizer. They bring it out whenever it is ready instead of all together so you get it at its hottest. It had an absolute southern taste.

The syrup was a bit much for me but it blended well with the chicken. I thought the waffle was only half at first but you do get a whole waffle they cut it in half. My sister had the chicken wings and mac and cheese. Probably the cheesiest mac and cheese I've ever had so that's a big plus. Our other friend had the shrimp and grits and was pleased. For dessert my sister had the butterscotch cake and I shared the velvet and berries with a friend. Veryyyyy yummy. Warning: the butterscotch cake is big!! Lastly to review: the chicken itself. Phenomenal. Coming from a semi southern household I have high fried chicken standards and Yard Bird met them no doubt. From the crunch to the seasoning to the meat itself.

We looked and saw that Yardbird got great reviews, but there were no reservations available.  So, we decided to walk down and find another place.  On our way, we passed by Yardbird, so I went in to see if they did indeed have no availability.  They didn't.  HOWEVER, they did have seating in the lounge area.  It's basically some couches surrounded by a few chairs.  I thought this was a great idea and even better than a regular table.  Right when we picked our own seating area, the hostess sat us down and we were given some menus.
 
After a few minutes, Kerri came over to help us.  She explained some of the more popular items and answered a few of our questions.  We ended up getting the Fried Green Tomato BLT, Mac and Cheese for the kids (no kids menu, but this was perfect for them), Original fried chicken (also for the kids), Short Rib, and a special of the day, which was fish.  First, the BLT was surprisingly good.  I normally ""like"" fried green tomatoes, but I ""love"" this appetizer (not a sandwich).  The tomato was such a refreshing take on the classic BLT.  The kids also loved their meals and I would have to agree that both the Mac and Cheese and the chicken were good as I had a little taste of both of them.  While the fish (cod) was cooked perfectly (crispy skin and all, along with some fabulous risotto), my favorite was easily the short rib.  The meat was incredibly tender and was so flavorful.  Since we were sharing all the dishes, I almost told my wife to get something in the room, so I could finish it all by myself!!  I'm just kidding, I would never do that.  I would send her to the nearest bathroom instead............
 
All the people working there were fantastic!  Unbelievably friendly and just made our whole experience there a blast.  Kerry was freakin' awesome and her personality was more like a good friend, more than our server.  In terms of the ambience, this is THE BEST place to just hang out with friends (or family, like us) and just do some casual people watching.  If you can get a seating area close to the walkway between Venetian and Palazzo, I recommend doing it.

We had made a reservation in advance and were seated at one of the primo tables right next to the line, where you can see all the action and food coming out of the kitchen. Our table shared a couple of appetizers--the buttermilk biscuits were good, but the fried green tomato BLT was ridiculously good. Among our entrees, I had the fried chicken and a couple of sides. The sides were fine, but the chicken was juicey and not too greasy or overdone. The cocktails were also on point. I'm not a bourbon drinker but really enjoyed a concoction with passionfruit and basil. 

Yardbird really lived up to their southern hospitality style because their service was beyond any restaurants we had experienced in Las Vegas. When my pescatarian friend wasn't a fan of the gnocchi pot pie, the manager went out of her way to have the kitchen make her an off the menu fish dish. When they found out our group was celebrating a bachelorette party, they brought out  champagne for all of us and a slice of red velvet cheesecake--on the house.

The Warm Farmer's Cheese is served on top of a cut of sweet watermelon and is soooo good. I'm not sure what farmer's cheese is, but it's so amazing I'd eat it on everything. My only suggestion is to give me more! For me, it would be a miss to come here and not experience it. 

I ordered the vegetarian entree, Gnocchi Pot Pie. It sounded amazing but when it came out it had so much fresh rosemary it was slightly bitter and I usually like Rosemary. I love that they make it from scratch in house and is served with half a biscuit above and below. I think with less Rosemary it would have been pretty incredible. 

My husband was a huge fan of the fried chicken and honey hot sauce. He says it will be his go to meal here.

What I found to be quite incredible on how well the staff worked together. And watching the kitchen, equally impressed with how fine tuned the kitchen ran from our view...and they've only been open for TWO DAYS!

Here for the week and will absolutely repeat before heading home. 

Thank you Carolina for a great experience!",kyFCu-Pq687UI9joS5Klzg,2,1,5,YEvpDtVD_-TEs30cWwFkIg

We were promptly seated and given menus. 30 seconds later our waiter wanted out drink order. We asked for water and more time with the cocktail menu. He came back just a minute or 2 later. We hurried up and ordered drinks and he asked for our food order at the same time and mentioned they were out of 3-4 menu items (despite it only being 7:30pm). We asked for more time. We rushed through the menu and when he came back 2 minutes later, we quickly chose what we'd order. We ordered an appetizer, fried chicken, and a side. 

Honestly, less than 5 minutes later all of our food came out at once - quicker than McDonalds (meant in a really bad way in case you're a McD fan). And our drinks didn't arrive for another 10 minutes after that. Our entire dinner was extremely rushed.  

It's not some casual business lunch place where speediness is expected and appreciated. I was on a date with my fiancé after a long day at work and we wanted to enjoy some good food and a couple drinks. It's obvious they just wanted to get you in and out and turn over the tables. 

It wasn't just our table - after receiving their food, the table next to us ordered another entree and more drinks. The waiter appeared obviously peeved that they were staying longer.  We laughed about how ridiculous the service was. My fiancé and I decided not to stay for another drink or dessert.",3V9ck9lJJwXnBHo5RY3zKQ,1,0,1,PPvptzvxW6ocf8kQbBRGmw

I generally steer clear of craft cocktails because most places try to hard to make them taste so fancy and they ruin the alcohol. But this place was on point. We all got different ones and they were all good. Word to the wise: even though the entree portions say serves 2-4 it's really a personal portion. 2-4 servings is if you are ordering family style. We also ordered the bone marrow which was amazing but you only really get 4 bites total for about $16 (?) So not really worth the money on that one.

The fried chicken at Yardbird does not disappoint! 

We also enjoyed the Mac n cheese. We ordered the short rib for dinner, per the suggestion of our server. It was nice, nothing to write home about. 

For brunch we had the chicken again, duh! And the Fried green tomato BLT, which was great.

1991276,2015-03-10,6,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I took a weekend Vegas trip with my family, and we ended up at Yardbird twice in a single day, first for brunch, then for a pre-dinner drink. It had just opened when we were staying at the Venetian, and my mom got some kind of coupon that was difficult to redeem (she was ultimately successful). I'm glad we took that enticement, though--I loved this place, and would be happy to go back next time I'm in this part of Vegas.

The space is great, comfortable and lovely, a melding of Southern charm and trendy Vegas pizzazz. We sat at a big table for brunch, and in nice lounge seating for drinks. The place seemed constantly busy, but not at full capacity. Service was great--helpful, timely, and friendly.

I sampled most of the cocktail menu over the course of this day, and I was pretty impressed with the showing. I had a Bloody Mary to start my brunch, and this was a fiery hot Bloody Mary, slightly thinner than I like but definitely tasty, garnished with a stuffed olive, a pickled green bean, pickled okra, a wedge of lime, and some bacon for good measure. Of the constructed cocktails on the menu, I particularly loved the Southern Revival and The Porkchop. The Southern Revival was a balanced mix of Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, and basil, with just the right amount of sweetness. The Porkchop was more unusual, made with Duke bourbon, dijon syrup, yuzu juice, and apple cider, served with a dijon thyme cube. This was savory, but not aggressively so, and I loved the way the ice cube yielded more flavor as it melted. I liked a few cocktails that seemed made for sipping on a sunlit porch--the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade made with Buffalo Trace, blackberry puree, lemon, cardamom, and Angostura bitters; the Watermelon Sling, with High West Silver Oat Whiskey, pressed watermelon juice, lemon, and Aperol; and the Southern Peach, with Old Forester 86, Aperol, lemon, thyme, white peach puree, and sweet tea. On the boozier end, I enjoyed the Yardbird Old Fashioned, featuring bacon-infused Buffalo Trace, Angostura bitters, orange bitters, and maple syrup. Probably would've been great with breakfast, actually.

The food was excellent, hearty Southern fare presented with a Vegas chef's edge. Our party of seven ordered a bunch of food to share, and it was a satisfying feast, with fried chicken as its anchor. We ordered one each of Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Lewellyn's was the plainer platter, just half a free range chicken made with a ""27-hour"" recipe, served with a honey hot sauce. The bigger dish came with fried chicken, honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, and bourbon maple syrup. The chicken was delicious, juicy and flavorful with crispy fried skin, and I loved the accompaniments, the soft, chewy savory waffle and the refreshing watermelon. We supplemented the chicken with a Yardbird Benedict, a butter lettuce and grilled mango salad, and a few sides. (My picky husband also had a plain waffle by himself, which he enjoyed with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and bourbon maple syrup.) The benedict was fantastic, with soft poached egg and house-cured bacon over a buttermilk biscuit crumble, all loaded with hollandaise. There was a little salad with a zippy pickled vinaigrette on the side. The lettuce and mango salad was our healthy order, but it was no filler--it came with fresh butter lettuce, char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, and a benne seed vinaigrette, all very good. For our sides, we ordered the skillet cornbread, the buttermilk biscuits, and the macaroni and cheese, all of which were very strong. The cornbread was dense and buttery, speckled with poppy seed and goat cheese. The flaky biscuits came with house blackberry jam and maple butter. Even the mac and cheese was pretty special, made with torchio pasta, a mix of five artisanal cheeses, and a crispy herb crust. It was fun making a plate with chicken and bits of salad and sides--it felt like a Vegas Thanksgiving.

My Vegas trips tend to cluster around the Venetian/Palazzo, and if they continue to do so, I'm sure I'll be back to Yardbird soon. It's now at the top of my list for a casual meal or a fancy cocktail away from the casino floor.",WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,9,10,5,Adk-j4cF5vYowSTk90EMig

As depicted numerous times in television and. movies, the south is famous/well known for their gracious manners, friendliness, and hospitality.  Though located in Las Vegas, the manners and charm of the South are ever present at Yardbird Southern Table & Bar.

NOTES:
1.  Reservation made via open table.
2.  Located on the first level/casino level of the Venetian Hotel (the popular ""Restaurant Row"" section of the resort).
3.  Seating areas include the bar, lounge area in the front, with more seating available in the rear with views of the kitchen.

My mom, brother, and I arrived promptly for our 7pm reservation, and were warmly greeted by the smiling hostesses.  We waited for a few minutes before she showed us to a table in the main dining room/area.

FOOD:
After looking thru the sizable menu, we decided (thanks to a recommendation from our server) to order some dishes to share family style.  Altogether we ordered the kale salad (add crispy chicken), and the fried chicken with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese.

Firstly, the kale salad is an extremely generous portion.  I can't imagine how a single individual would attempt to finish this on their own.  This was a great start to our meal, as we portioned the salad between the three of us (effectively satisfying our appetites momentarily).

The main entree and sides came out a short time later, and like the salad, we found these portions to be just right for dinner.  One MUST order the fried chicken.  Please do.  Though one mustn't indulge in fried foods often, an exception must be made for the fried chicken at YSTB.  Its basically a half portion of their chicken, and its worth the calories.  The skin is crisp while the meat is soft and moist.  Of the two sides, we favored the mac and cheese.  The collard greens was a wee bit salty for our tastes.

SERVICE:
All the staff we encountered during our visit provided excellent customer service.  We especially liked our server as she was friendly, gracious, patient, and extremely knowledgeable.  We appreciated her recommendations and patience as we looked thru the menu.  She and the other staff checked on our table periodically throughout the meal.  She truly made us feel welcome!

side NOTE:
The honey hot sauce that is served with the fried chicken is quite HOT.  Really HOT.  Just a forewarning for future diners.  

BOTTOM LINE:
Southern hospitality is top notch at the Las Vegas location of YSTB!  The exceptional customer service, as well as the delicious food were definite highlights of this dining experience.  Will definitely return on a future visit to LV.  Recommended!",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,20,16,5,PONcx1yvkoXNnroQ_94uug

First off, that watermelon salad, it's really 3 triangles of watermelon with a dollop of grilled farmer's cheese on top with a lemon vinaigrette The vinaigrette had been grilled into the cheese and formed a crystallized texture on top of the cheese and it was amazing! I've never had anything like it.

Deviled eggs were perfect once I sent them back to take the god damned salmon roe off the top...what's with places shoving roe down our throats? I hate it! But, I loved these eggs! 

The biscuits weren't fluffy, but they had the perfect texture to hold the meat in. The brisket was a little fatty but it really was a great sandwich!

The set up makes you feel like you're sitting in someone's backyard at a BBQ...and they projected various images of Elvis, Johnny Cash and other folks whom I presume were southern-type musicians from the days of yore onto the white brick wall.

We left a lil buzzed with full bellies and we couldn't be happier! :) What a great start to our trip!",_vk88Fk8e7_HkXSMb9M9AQ,2,1,4,D7tRahszaA05MXH15Kr32A

Prior to Yardbird, I had never quite been the fried chicken connoisseur. There are many top notch fried chicken places in New York City but conveniently, Popeyes and KFC had always been my go-to fried chicken places. While in Vegas, I really wanted my taste buds to blossom. I kept hearing from others and reading about this place on Yelp... Over 2000+ reviews and 4.5 stars for a fried chicken place?! That was enough to lure my coworkers and I in.

I'm going to save you the hassle and tell you to just go ahead and order the fried chicken and waffles. Why? Well, firstly, their waffles are literally the fluffiest waffles and I have ever had. Not to mention, they go incredibly well with the house made maple syrup. Next we have the fried chicken which is like on a whole 'nother level... The chicken is cooked perfectly - crispy, yet tender and juicy. If you don't try their chicken with the hot sauce, you're seriously not doing it right. The hot sauce was tangy and not overwhelmingly spicy, but still had a nice kick to it. To top that all off, the dish also came with watermelon soaked in some kind of magic dressing or sauce... The watermelon was a refreshing and delicious combination of sweet & savory. There were so many flavors dancing in my mouth in this meal alone, my taste buds couldn't be happier!

Fast forward to now, I am still missing Yardbird fried chicken. Fried chicken fast food chains are no longer the same to me. I am committed to Yardbird and look forward until the next time we reconvene.",c2Ey5yS0Vmjl1XCJiH8WUw,3,1,5,QjbBx6NIsRjoUQqivjuRUQ

We are big fans of Gordon Ramsey so when we saw the winner from Hell's Kitchen this year was going to go there, we decided to check out. The service was not good.

When he came back he asked if we were ready to order and we did and he seemed annoyed that we didn't ask him what to order. I felt kind of bad and asked if we missed something and he told us the biscuits were to die for. So we ordered a basket to go with our meal. He then asked if we wanted a drink...

I ordered the shrimp and grits and my wife ordered the brisket sandwich. The shrimp and grits was ok but my wife said the brisket was unreal. The biscuits this guy went on and on about were ok.

fried green tomatoes: tasteless, and the piece of pork belly on top was chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside... Not good at all. 
The cornbread: extremely salty and the crust tasted like rust possibly from the small iron skillet it was served in.
Chicken biscuit: again the biscuits were salty and stale and the chicken was rubbery and over-cooked. 
Mac'n cheese: nothing special at all, very neutral and bland in flavor.

Found this quite by accident. I did a Google search for something and this came up as an advertisement,  hubby's been wanting fried chicken, we're in Vegas and eating stuff I shouldn't so why not. It's located in the restaurant row of the Venetian and you should make sure to have a reservation because it gets crowded.

Our server was a very nice young man who took time to explain the menu. Food is served family style and the menu says everything serves 2-4 people. Our server said he always suggested that people order two entrees but believe me for normal appetites would be way too much food.  As it was we couldn't eat all we ordered. 

We started with biscuits, we thought they would come with the meal.  I'm sure they had a whole pound of butter in the four we were served and there was a jar of apple jelly and a jar of honey butter.  We managed to each eat one.  The. We shared an iceberg lettuce salad that came with tomatoes, avocado, fried pork belly cubes and an amazing dressing. Again we couldn't eat all of it.  Our main course was chicken and waffles.  OMG, to die for. The chicken was perfectly cooked and those waffles, well I could eat them every day. They had cheddar cheese inside and came with a bourbon maple syrup. I just ate mine plain. Who needed syrup. There was also some huge cubes of watermelon which was pickled and while it sounds strange tasted really good.  It was a half a chicken and of course couldn't finish that either.  Because I love grits I ordered a side of cheesy grits and alas, they were pretty mediocre. Only down side of the meal.  Wish we could have taken the leftovers home with us.

While there were a couple of very expensive entrees, the chicken was very affordable. I had wine, hubby had tea and the entire bill was only $100.  Not bad for a fine meal.",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,0,1,4,1mDfI5QmN6syHVcM11bMgA

2048404,2016-12-28,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"After finding out the wait for bacchanal buffet was 3+ hours, I was frantically looking for a new restaurant to eat at. Thankfully, Yardbird still had some reservations available on Friday at 5:45pm for 4 people so my family rushed over as soon as we could. To my surprise, the bar area in the front of the restaurant was really dark and had lounge tables and chairs everywhere. There were some people eating in this area but I think it was mostly for people who only wanted drinks. However, later when I was leaving I did see some families eating in the lounge area, probably since it was busier and there were no tables available. 

My family was seated in the dining area of the restaurant, which was towards the back, closer to the kitchen. Our waiter carefully explained the menu to us and gave great recommendations. We ordered the shrimp n' grits, Lewellyn's fried chicken, and short rib at first and then realized that wasn't enough, so we added the swine burger. We ended our meal by sharing the salted caramel bread pudding. 

Shrimp n' Grits: (4/5). I don't eat this dish too often so I can't say much on the grits except that it wasn't too mushy. The shrimp, however, was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I don't remember exactly what the sauce was on this dish but my family actually ended up dipping our fries in it. 

Lewellyn's fried chicken: (5/5). Ugh there just wasn't enough chicken...4 pieces ain't enough!! The chicken was fried perfectly, with all the juices still trapped inside the skin. The breading was thin, but it was fried well that the skin was still crunchy. I actually enjoyed the honey hot sauce that it came with too. It wasn't too sour like some hot sauces are, and added a nice kick to the chicken. 

Short Rib: (4/5). This dish comes with green beans, mashed potatoes, and corn. Everything went very well together and the short rib...omg it was cooked so well. The meat just fell apart in your mouth!! 

The Swine Burger: (4/5). A solid burger. I loved the pork belly in it, as it melted in my mouth. There's different meats in this burger (short rib, pork belly) so it was a little messy to eat. However, they give you the vegetables on the side (lettuce, tomato, picked red onion) which made it a little better. Fries were also pretty solid. They don't give you ketchup though so you have to ask. 

Salted caramel bread pudding: (4/5). I definitely tasted the whiskey in the whiskey anglaise. It wasn't too strong but still noticeable. My favorite were the dragee pecans, which were really salty/sweet but went so well with the bread pudding itself. 

Overall, a nice restaurant with great Southern comfort food. Service was pretty good and our water cups were always filled. It is a little pricey but I think it's worth a try, especially if you're craving fried chicken!!!",Rhlbsy95KOu26BvL4U8Ftw,2,1,4,k7oJRcDciO1i8UYDogAqOA

Sat at the Bar and was served by the nicest bartender on trip she knew I wanted to try a couple of things but was alone so tough to order whole lot so she said I can put an order in for one of each of these three things that I wanted The Fried Green tomato BLT, Chicken and Biscuit and the pork Terrine. For good measure and push the meal over the top I also added the Smoked and Roasted Bone Marrow. LETS JUST Say Wow The Bone Marrow was the big winner smoked bone marrow Yum Roasted bone marrow is normally great but the smoke flavor just made it crazy served with a little sweet jam it was truly decadent. The BLT was amazing also was served with pork belly instead of a thin slice of bacon like normal. The Chicken and biscuit if I had not tasted the Bone Marrow first would probably have been really good but with competiion like the bone marrow and the BLT it was just out shined. The Pork Terrine almost the same thing it was very good but just was overshadowed by the Bone Marrow. Was kinda funny the couple sitting next to me at the bar came over and asked to take pictures of my food. I got a kick out of that. Now that was just the first day then I came back here on the Saturday to try out their brunch menu. I ordered a Pork Chop Drink which sounded about as strange as it could but tasted really good it had dijon mustard and apple cider in it along with bourbon but somehow worked well together. The bartenders here are exceptional Mixologist when she made the Pork chop it poured out exactly to the top with not even a drop more needed. I ordered the Yardbird Benedict which came in a small iron skillet and had a ton of flavor from the porkbelly they used as bacon for the Benedict, Their hollandaise sauce  was good had that bite like its suppose to and the biscuits are just flaky and good the eggs where just right not to soft. For dessert I had the Hickory smoked chocolate coffee cake which when it came out looked just like a regular loaf cake and I was kinda disappointed till I tasted it then boom wow it was good smoke flavor again surprised me that it worked with a simple loaf cake but it took it to another level they served it with coffee ice cream which I never usually like but matched perfect with the cake which was served warm.

My husband and I had fried chicken , fries and skillet cornbread . The chicken was seasoned perfectly , very tender and tasty.

We had the Fried Green Tomato BLT (house smoked pork belly, smoked tomato jam frisée, pimento cheese, and pickled lemon vinaigrette), Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles (honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup), Shrimp 'n' Grits (seared shrimp, roasted tomatoes, virginia ham, red onions, nora mill grits, pbr chicken jus). The fried tomato appetizer was the best, but the other two plates were very good as well. As Yardbird serves southern food, the portions are larger than you'd expect at a nicer place like this. We couldn't finish all three plates - something to keep on mind as most people won't want leftovers to carry around when exploring Vegas.

I went for the full chicken dinner (i.e. no waffle) and a side of biscuits. Excellent biscuits. The chicken is very tasty. White and dark are moist.

We got some Buttermilk Biscuits to share to start and they were amazing: perfectly buttery and flaky with a tasty apple jam to spread on them. I would say these are a MUST! For our meal, we got the Lewllyn's Fried Chicken and a side of Mac and Cheese--both were some of the best I've ever had. The fried chicken was spiced well and the batter wasn't too thick or too thin so it was just crispy enough to complement the tender chicken underneath. It came with a honey hot sauce as well that I honestly need served by the bottle because it was so good. They even had gluten-free fried chicken for my wife! And the mac and cheese was really cheesy but not gritty or soupy and the breadcrumbs on top gave it a nice little crunch.

We were in Vegas for my bachelorette's weekend and my MOH made a reservation to have dinner here.  First, the manager gave us free shots just for celebrating with them. Let's get to the food yea? 

Dinner:

Fried chicken: DELICIOUS probably the best I've ever had. Flavor, crispy and moist. My friend has been to Willie Mae's in New Orleans and she said it was not Willie Mae's good but comparable.

Mac n Cheese: so simple but yet so cheesy and so good

Deviled Eggs: so creamy and flavorful

Shrimp & Grits: oh man flavor explosion...everything in each bite is just perfect. The seasoning was on point and the grits itself is so creamy.

Kale Salad: simple yet good 

Skillet Corn Bread: best cornbread I've had ..... so moist and tasty

Brunch:

Chicken Salad: so good & not over mayo which i love 

Yardbird's special biscuit & gravy: OMGGGGGG this one was amazing. Biscuits with bacon and fried chicken topped with gravy and eggs. Need I say more? Just get it

Yardbird's benedict: so good too

I probably tried half of their menu and I am ready to go back for more. I can't wait to visit this place again when I make my way back to Vegas.

We could smell the food over other eateries in the Venetian. 

Anyways they took our drink order and appetizer order immediately. Drinks arrived very fast and the appetizer right after. They brought out our buscuits with some butter and jam. HOLY S%#@ these were amazing! There were about 4 buscuits in the basket. 

We ordered the shrimp and grits, and the swine burger (or something like that). 

The burger came with TWO patties that were made from brisket, short rib, chuck eye and topped with a thick strip of pork belly. Also served were fries. 

The shrimp and grits came with about 6 to 7 shrimp. Amazing. Grits and ajus were super tasty. 

We ordered the crispy brussel sprouts made with honey and another HOLY S#%@ moment. Those were insanely good. 

Our drinks were never less than half full. The servers checked on us regularly and the price came out to $68. We missed the fried chicken which they're known for, which was ok cause we will be back.

The place is open, airy and pretty cool. They stream black and white pictures of epic stars like like Bob Dylan, Fats Domino and Elvis to name a few. I loved how the intimate seating allows you to take a comfortable peek at the nearby diners food and engage in conversation if you so choose. 

Now, about the meal. Look, I am writing this review approximately 6 months after dining here and I still remember how good my meal was. I opted for the chicken and waffles and it did not disappoint.  Juicy chicken that was seasoned so well throughout and hard to put down. A waffle with the perfect texture which was soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside with bits of cheese throughout. I didn't care too much for the bourbon maple syrup because it was too strong and overpowered the delicate waffle. I also can't say I cared too much for the chilled spiced watermelon though. I like my watermelon in it's natural state with nothing added to it. Whatever they flavored it with made it more savory and just didn't mingle well with my taste buds.

There is a long bar area with a high top drink rail that opens to the corridor of the Venetian. There is also a large lounge area with oversized leather chairs again looking out through windows to the corridor.

The main restaurant was in the rear. Our experience suffered a bit because our waitress was in training. She was pleasant and tried hard, but some things needed more explanation. Like....it is supposed to be family style ordering. Luckily we both ordered the fried chicken and received one order of it (which is about half a chicken). But really could have used a preamble like ""two sides to share will do for the table"".

Anyways: the food.
Fried green tomato BLT: Good. Not great. Three large slices of cornmeal crusted green tomato dressed with pimento cheese, bacon, tomato jam, salad. Hard to get all the tastes in one bite.
Biscuits: came with 4. Fluffy, warm.
Cauliflower mashed potatoes: bland, boring.
Fried chicken: soooo moist. Crunchy spiced breading, sweet/spicy dipping sauce. Yum! Definitely skip the veggies and get more chicken.

However, Yardbird delivered, on a recent dinner visit with my mom. First of all, make a reservation! The place gets packed very quickly, and the tables are tight. We had a two-top against a wall, and it was pretty cozy next to the other tables. I'm not holding that against them though! Just FYI. 

My mom and I decided to share a few things: the Iceberg Wedge, the Classic Buttermilk Biscuits, and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles entree. I also tried one of their the signature cocktails, the Southern Revival. First of all, I loved my drink; it was composed of Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, basil, and served over block ice in a Mason jar. The flavors really melded well together. The iceberg wedge was fresh and delicious, and the unusual addition of charred corn added a unique flavor. The biscuits were flaky, buttery delights, and I wanted to smear that house-made jam and fresh honey butter over everything and anything. Last but not least, we received our entree. That fried chicken was amaaaazing-- juicy and tender on the inside, perfect crispy skin outside-- and everything that accompanied it was fantastic too. You could really taste the bourbon in the syrup, and the hint of cheddar in the waffle was the perfect amount. I wanted more of everything!

Since we were pretty full from our big comfort food dinner, we took a dessert to go: the Butterscotch Cake, which has bacon frosting (!!!), butterscotch sauce, toasted pecan and comes with bourbon ice cream. We ate the ice cream at the restaurant and it was very good. We had the cake later and it was a bit dense, but still quite indulgent and yummy.

We had a delicious meal at Yardbird, and we appreciated the friendly and attentive service as well. I would love to return in the future and try more of their awesome menu.",TKzFASCz7GLGUcwO1QG2jA,10,7,5,5JMOnJqJnqOY_H6BbAt8VQ

The biscuits were good and I loved the jam and butter that came with it. The burger unfortunately was way too greasy and the bottom of the bun was soggy and inedible. The chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My only issue was the bourbon syrup. We are not drinkers, so the heavy alcoholic taste of the syrup ruined the waffles. By itself it tasted great but kinda poured the syrup on before we tasted it, so make sure you guys taste the syrup before you pour it on because the couple next to us also had the same issue.

We had a nice variety to eat. I started with the Georgia Peach cocktail, and thought it was wonderful. It was a slightly liquor forward drink, and the peach really helped sweeten up the alcohol. I would definitely recommend it!

We had a couple appetizers. The deviled eggs stole the show for me. Piled atop with the most delicious yolk mixture - salty, savory, decadent. I would go back for these! We also had the fried green tomatoes. I loved the tomato part - really crispy and wonderfully flavorful. I didn't love the pork belly, because it's just not my go to kind of meat. I would have preferred some crispy bacon. 

For the entree, we shared the 1/2 bird (Lewelyn's fried chicken). The chicken itself was good, it just wasn't my style of fried chicken. The batter was a great consistency (light and not super crispy) however, it had a slight sweetness that I wasn't a huge fan of. I prefer my chicken to be savory or even spicy. We also shared the mac and cheese, and that was phenomenal! Perfectly aldente pasta and it had the creamiest texture!

So, I'd go back for the deviled eggs and the mac and cheese. Lovely experience - I just wouldn't get the chicken again because I've had better.",CQyN3l8KelnpsV5r8D3__g,2,3,3,gUVLXEfMijb4vTJmVlSs2Q

We were staying at The Venetian so this was a short walk. We were starving and the yelp reviews were on point with this place. 

We ordered the deviled eggs as appetizers . So good and the perfect amount of mustard. 

We went with the chicken and waffles that came with watermelon. The best part was the bourbon maple syrup and the honey hot sauce. We also ordered the Mac and cheese. Overall we were very impressed. The prices are a little high but it is Vegas and the chicken was so moist. I loved that the waffle was not too savory or too sweet. The Mac and cheese was amazing, you can tell it's made with real cheese!!! We ate sitting on couches and wanted to nap after lol.

If anything, they subvert it, because who comes to Nevada to get high-end preparations of dishes from the South? 

The fried chicken is obviously the thing to get here - juicy and incredibly crunchy - though the biscuit turned out to be a serving side that lent itself well to exploring other parts of the menu, too. The large bones delivered to our table rendered their marrow easily, though it was upstaged by the orange marmalade and tomato jam that came with it. Even a tomato salad in February was successful thanks to golf ball-sized heirloom tomatoes and homemade ricotta. 

After several of beers from one of the best tap selections on the Strip and an impossibly large butterscotch cake, the friends I brought to Yardbird were suitably impressed at the meal they had.

2168618,2018-06-23,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird is upscale Southern cooking, and does a decent job of it. I wouldn't call it soul food, because it does lack a little soul, but overall, it is a solid dining experience. 

The theme is rustic, lots of wood for sure. There's an odd video installation projected on one of the walls that shows various southern-ish people and items. I say southern-ish because some make no sense at all, while others are clearly southern. Service was pleasant and friendly and water was refilled promptly and dishes cleared away quickly.

The food was mostly good, with only one glaring misstep. Our party of 4 (incidentally, 3 of us lived in NC for many years, so we know southern cooking!) started with an order of biscuits and deviled eggs to start. The biscuits were good- hearty, buttery, dense yet moist. The apple jam on the side was a nice complement. 

However, the deviled eggs were a prime example of ""trying to do too much"". They looked extra fancy- a tower of swirled egg yolk with seasonings atop the whites. The taste, though ... yuck. Too much dill, not enough mayo, no pickle relish. They were dry and oddly sour at the same time. We sent them back and replaced them with another order of biscuits. Blah! 

Luckily, that was the only misstep. My boyfriend loved the signature fried chicken, and was gracious enough to let me taste it. Juicy, great batter, crunch on the outside and bursted with flavor on the inside. The honey hot sauce was perfect too, loved the sweetness and it gave enough kick without being too spicy.

I really enjoyed my shrimp and grits. Plenty of meaty shrimp (although I wish they'd come without the tails still on), and full of ham. The grits were creamy but not watery, and as a whole it was a good dish. I would have liked a bit more spice or kick to it, but nothing to really complain about.

Our friends said their meals were good too, so overall, Yardhouse hit the mark. A little more ""soul"" and it could get the Southern seal of approval!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,2,2,4,X_r4Ircy1iPab5PXO5eo3g

Two pieces of fried chicken I wanna say both were thighs

Other then their food, their brews were good I sampled there house hef, that was delicious, but who doesn't like a cold beer on tap!!

-fried pickles (skip this, too salty)

I was slightly intimidated being a party of 1 since it looked like all the tables were communal. I was delighted when the host turned a corner to another room that looked more like a typical dining room. I love the decor, the style, the bathrooms, all lovely. Rustic, industrial, modern, comfy. Lively and energetic ambiance without being too loud. Casual, but nice. I feel like I could return with my kids. 5 stars for ambiance.

Service was great. Hosts were really friendly, servers were attentive. Food runners were a little more attentive than my actual server, but she was still very nice. 4.5 stars for service.

The menu was creative. A modern twist on southern/american favorites. I came for the Restaurant Week menu which was 3 courses. I chose the fried green tomato blt, blue plate special, and ended with creme brulee. The runner actually brought out deviled eggs first, but when I notified him I had ordered the blt he left the eggs so I could have both. Deviled eggs were good but a little much for me. A little salty, herbs a bit overpowering. Just not my thing. The BLT was very good. It was my first time having fried green tomatoes, which I loved. The pork belly was delicious. The spread that was on top of the tomato was, again, a little much for me. Nice flavor, but too intense for me. The main course was the blue plate special, which was fried chicken, biscuit, spiced watermelon. The spiced watermelon was interesting, a great palate cleanser. The biscuit was delicious! The fried chicken was nice and crispy, but once again, very seasoned which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not ""my"" thing. I ordered a side of the gravy they serve with biscuits and gravy which was creamy, rich, and meaty. If it hadn't had rosemary in it I would have really loved it. It seems like chefs love to use rosemary here in Vegas because it grows EVERYWHERE. But that's the very reason why I don't like it much anymore; I smell it every time I walk through my front yard. Enough of that tangent. 3 stars for food.

Here's what I loved: The Arnold Palmer and the Creme Brulee!!! 
I know you're thinking, Arnold Palmer? She's impressed with iced tea and lemonade? Yes, I'm off the sauce currently so I really love when restaurants create delicious non-alcoholic beverages. This is one of the best drinks I've ever had. I'd return just for the Arnold Palmer. Oh, and the creme brûlée. Again, you're thinking, creek brûlée? What is this, 1990? But their take on it is absolutely delicious. 5 stars for dessert and drinks. By the way, their drink menu looked pretty amazing. If their cocktails are made with the same care as the iced tea and lemonade, you should give this place a try.

All in all I had an enjoyable lunch. I might return and give them another shot.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,1,1,4,RVnBwgm5MXAhyB6gbZQekw

i love southern food so i was intrigued.
unfortunately, most of the items fell a bit short for me.
i think i only half enjoyed every dish that we had.

country pork terrine - this was my favorite, i think.  the terrine was very rich and flavorful without being fatty and heavy.  the bread was nice and crusty.  the pickles were delicious.

kitchen pickle jar - another favorite.  i love pickles and their pickles are, again, delicious.  a nice serving of pickled cauliflower, turnips, green beans, mushrooms, peppers, carrots, beets.

warm farmer's cheese - basically a less flavorful feta, warmed up, over some not-so-ripe watermelon.  i can definitely do this better myself.

short rib n grits - the short rib was dry and overcooked.  the grits were pretty good though.

chicken n watermelon n waffles - greasy waffles just aren't my thing, chicken wing.  chicken was overcooked and it appeared that the oil in their fryer needed changing.  again, not-so-ripe watermelon.  if you're gonna have watermelon on your menu, please make sure it's ripe.  otherwise, don't serve it.  take it off the menu.  putting salt on the watermelon to disguise how not sweet it is doesn't work for me.  

skillet cornbread (cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, maple butter) - not very fluffy.  a little crumbly which is not my jam.  it could've used some jam, actually.  and then jalapeno?  there was no jalapeno flavor at all.  maple butter?  what maple butter?  all i could taste was saltiness from the bacon.  but i love cornbread so i half liked it.

i think i would go back to try other items.

This place probably takes the cake for fried chicken. My friend kept insisting that we try this place because it was amazing. We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch expecting to eat the best fried chicken ever and left satisfied as ever. We were seated immediately because we had reservations.

After a couple of minutes of browsing the menu we decided to order family style and share a bunch of dishes. We ordered the cornbread, biscuits, fried chicken, deviled eggs, dulce de leche waffles, and bacon. 

For the record I HATE eating the breast piece of the chicken because of its notorious rep of being too dry if cooked wrong but I took a risk and tried the breast here and was not disappointed at all. The breast was not dry and had so much flavor (I guess 27 hours of marinade is the trick). The cornbread was delicious. The jalapeno and bacon complemented the sweet cornbread so well that I kept wishing that the skillet was magical and more bread would appear. The biscuits were okay, a little doughy in the middle. The bacon was so crispy and delicious! Just the way I like it. The deviled eggs hit me with a surprise when it came out with roe on the top! They were so delicious and creamy. The dulce de leche waffles were not too sweet, just perfect!

The staff was so nice and attentive to make sure that we had everything that we needed and wanted to enjoy our meal. One of our food items was taking too long in the kitchen that one of the mangers came over and ensured us that she was watching to make sure that item would come out as soon as possible and apologized for the delay.

FOOD

I had to go with chicken, waffle, watermelon and a side of mac & cheese. The chicken and waffle are great and the plate is generous so perfect size for sharing.

I know my super chicken reference will go over most's head, but it drives the point home for what yardbird has perfected: the chicken! Even as I type this I can still taste it and that's a marvelous thing.

With a few visits now under my belt I can honestly say I would not go anywhere else in Vegas for fried chicken (well maybe if someone can prove better chicken exists). The Palazzo has done right here for sure!

I'm so in love with their brunch menu and it's a shame they only offer it on the weekends. Thankfully most of the items on that menu are offered regularly, but someday I will have returned for the maple glazed bacon doughnut which I've yet to have, but keep an eye out for that picture down the road. 

The first visit here I wasn't aware of the huge portions here so keep that in mind before doing a menu sample like I did (it caused me to have this as one meal the entire day). I began with their deviled eggs and I have to say these are some of the best around. As you can tell from my picture they are artistically presented and more important taste amazing! I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think it's the dill that made it burst out with flavor. Either way a must have item. Then silly me progressed on to the macaroni and cheese. The portion size will fool you as I thought it was small at first, but boy is that far from the truth. You'll be pleasantly plumped out and have to say the five cheese blend is the star here. Super gooey and another 5 star side for sure! If that wasn't enough I washed all this down with the chicken/watermelon/waffle trifecta. The cheddar cheese waffle surprisingly is not heavy and was perfectly crisped while still edging on the soft side. The spicy watermelon was definitely a new twist on things, but I thought it worked really well combined with everything. It gave the chicken a little kick while the sweet made you feel like you were on top of the world. The coup de gras here is definitely the fried chicken. It is moist as the southern humidity (hopefully that reference is understood) yet the breading is crisp as can be. 

On my recent outing I twisted it up and had lunch yet again was pleasantly surprised with their crunchy Yardbird sandwich. I hate to say it, but I know this will put the next chicken sandwich I have to shame. Oddly enough it's the hot sauce that made the meal pop. It won't lead you to guzzling down gallons of water so that's certainly a plus. Another highlight was the bun. It truly was like eating a pillow. It was so soft and soaked up all the sauce to perfection! In closing I finally saved room for dessert and went with their banana pudding, but certainly I will be back for the cobbler to see if it's worth the hype. The sad part is I didn't prefer it to come out in the mason jar as I did find it a bit trying to get every morsel and I did leave chunks of things I couldn't get to because of it which was depressing. All in all though it's one of the better versions I've consumed. The house made banana chip is to die for as it wasn't overly sugary like most I'be been exposed to. 

As I end this I can't help but flock to the same thought. The chicken is legit here and I am flapping wildly for a return visit sooner rather than later!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,1,1,5,w2ETcLAVrExIBnxg57EVZg

I just wanted a place to grab a good tasty lunch and relax for about an hour. The atmosphere at Yardbird caught my eye. Hip, and relaxed joint with comfortable couches/seating. I was promptly greeted by my waitress Isidra who asked what I'd like to drink. After I indicated a beer she immediately recommended me a double IPA after a couple questions regarding which beers I prefer. Isidra offered me a sample. PERFECT! I scanned the menu and was undecided. Isidra recommended I try the lunch special which was a blackened salmon with shrimp served over jambalaya. That was exactly what I was looking for!! Seafood with robust flavors and some heat. The well plated dish arrived and was a 5 out of 5. The blackened salmon was moist and executed PERFECTLY. Shrimp was succulent and the jambalaya was the rich, spicy, and starchy component that connected all the dots. The portion was extremely generous. My recommended IPA was an amazing compliment to this extraordinary meal. I must give the utmost thanks to Isidra who absolutely made my experience EXCEPTIONAL. Her genuine interest in recommending the items on the menu that would meet my expectations was the key to making this a dining experience worth writing about.

I am a very hard critique on southern food! This place nailed it. As in, 10 out of 10 stars. 

The decor is supercool, think Restoration Hardware meets farmhouse meets blues! Loved the Mason Jar ceiling! The wine collection is impressive, and the bourbon and whiskey selection was grand! My mouth was hanging open reading the list...Basil Haydens, Angels Envy, even Pappy Van Winkle...

We were sat immediately and given menus. We decided to start with Fried Green Tomatoes. I fell in love.
Oh my worrrrd. They are so delicious. They were in a thick but not too thick cornmeal batter and they were perfect! Served with a hearty portion of pimento cheese on top, and ohhh that pimento cheese was the perfect combination of not too much pimento and a hard consistency of finely grated sharp cheddar....and super fresh!!! And then, top it off with a healthy piece of applewood smoked bacon! I mean I would like to eat these fried green tomatoes everyday of my life.....

My husband had the skillet fried chicken. They served it with a hot sauce honey dip that was scrumptious. I had the butter salad and it was delicious, also. Butter lettuce,  tomatoes, fresh and perfectly ripe avocados, corn, and drizzled with a to-die-for homemade buttermilk ranch dressing...I had it topped with fried chicken of course. This isnt a place you want to  count calories! I could have licked my plate. Everything we ate was perfection. 

My husband loves dessert! His favorite part of the meal.
We tried two:
The butterscotch cake and the bread pudding. The 4 layer butterscotch cake is intertwined with a layer of pecan pie filling, and paired with a hearty scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, and the ice cream is garnished with bacon, of course. It was a little too rich for my tasting, but my husband loved it! 

Now for the bread pudding: y'all...that bread pudding is better than ANY I've ever tasted. Even better than Commander's Palace in New Orleans. They put a cream filling inside and it was perfection. Oh my word. I mean, I'm still hallucinating over that bread pudding! 

Our server was so hospitable. She timed our food perfectly, and we loved chatting with your cutie pie manager, Sarah. She's a gem. If I had to get reallly picky, my only recommendation is that I would love to see more wines by the glass. So many great selections were bottles only. I can't drink a bottle at lunch and be productive the rest of the day. 

Do NOT miss this place in Vegas! 

I will be back to this establishment before my trip is over! It is THAT good! And I will PRAY every night that we are blessed with this restaurant expansion in Nashville!!  Well done, Yardbird!",RSzebxMaWNJnmuDjKcSf5g,1,0,5,TPq1nQeLWtVxpEprqJbL_g

Came in on a weekday, late afternoon, around 4ish, not busy, we were seated right away. Nice/simple decor, casual ambience.

Service was attentive and friendly. 

The crispy chicken (fried chicken on biscuit) I wasn't too impressed. They had a tiny bit of jelly on the 2 sliders, but not much. The meal overall was a bit dry. There wasn't anything special about the flavor either. I ended up asking for some honey to try and remedy the dryness and lack of flavor. 

Hubby ordered their burger. It's huge and came with fries. He enjoyed it. 

Their macaroni and cheese was also pretty good. Had a nice cheesy flavor, not too salty. If anything, it also was just a tiny bit on the dry side.

Cornbread... Was my favorite. Comes in a skillet with a huge spoonful of soft butter ok top. Super tasty. It didn't have much of the flavors its described as having (jalapeño cheddar.... Bacon.. I think, I can't remember)... If anything it was very subtle.. But it had a nice flavor overall...

Since we had a suite at the Venetian anyway, we didn't have to walk through half of Vegas to get to dinner - very nice, since the temperatures around Christmas were super chilly.

Anywho.... I was super happy with our selection. I would have loved to get the roasted bone marrow for starters, but the guy on the table next to us got the last portion - which made me stare at him madly all evening, haha!
So we ended up sharing the fried green tomato BLT and it was SO GOOD!
As an entree I had the shrimp 'n grits and the hubby the pork ribs. I was happy, he thought the sauce on the ribs was a bit off... that was a bummer, but didn't kill the mood at all. 
Oh, btw... we had a coupon from the hotel for a house cocktail each. I can't remember what it was, but it was really good. I don't drink alcohol very often, so it gave me a nice buzz... sweeeet!

We skipped dessert, because of the fullness of our bellies, but got into a funny little argument with the waiter about one of the pictures on the wall.

KFC got it wrong. From the moment you bite into the deliciously brined for 27 hours chicken your mouth is hit with an orgasm of flavors. From salty to savory to crunchy to perfection.

This chicken literally makes you want to slap your mother...

They go one step further and pair it with a delicious cheddar cheese waffle. Then they elevate the syrup with a little bit of bourbon and a nice shot of hot sauce. Oh, they are not finished there, they then give you six perfectly cut chilled cubes of mint watermelon....

They literally could have charged me $100 for that plate and I would pay you.

I didn't care as much for the watermelon they serve with the chicken and waffle - nothing special but not an issue because the portion sizes are so large. The deviled eggs and collard greens (which are served with fresh pork rind on top) has just the right bite, seasoning, and heat.

Boy am I glad we came here. It was the perfect morning after cure - good down home American food. This place is not healthy so please stay away if you're not looking for a heavy meal. We started with the cinnamon apple hand pies and HIGHLY recommend them if you like sweet in the morning and are a fan of apple pies. They were absolutely delicious. All of the apples were covered in cinnamon sugar and just divine. We also ordered the crispy chicken biscuit which was delicious as well - the perfect blend of savory and sweet. 

The ambiance is super cool. There's a bunch of old rock mementos. I liked that you didn't feel like you were inside a casino and its as if all that didn't exist. It probably helped that we weren't seated by the door/windows facing the casino.

The service was great. As we were most likely our server's first table of the morning, he was super attentive and didn't seem slammed or stressed as it can sometimes be during brunch. He gave us the recommendation on the biscuit and I'm glad that we took him up on it.

This place is definitely great for the morning after brunch. I would imagine their dinner is pretty good as well. Looking forward to stopping in the next time we're in vegas.",y_LdP8n1VcwEzoNLndbYxA,0,1,5,prZkL3C5910JeF0V7LH5Gw

This place does family style southern food (with a twist) and so the meals are meant to be shared. We decided to try a few things - chicken/waffles, Salisbury steak (that was my husbands strange choice), with sides of Mac and cheese, cornbread and grits. It was WAAY too much food but we wanted to try a few menu items. We were informed some items require additional cook time. They do, however bring the food out as it ready so you can eat other things while waiting. 

The food was ok. Chicken was crispy and moist but lacked flavor. Waffles were waffles. The Salisbury steak had an overpowering taste and the grits were dense. We left a but disappointed - but for all we got it was only $100. 

The service, much like the food, was average. The waitstaff work together so various people came by to refill drinks, clear plates and bring food. 

Would we return? Probably not. We kept lamenting that we were not eating the delicious chicken and waffles from LoLo's (in the Phoenix area).",QesDcfDUyN8rF_GWvWWNqg,1,0,3,-iVSibxWbDo0aKkcz02vFg

Well let me tell you that the food here was great!  My waiter Tyler S., who served us, was very friendly and very professional.   I started off with the Fried Green Tomato BLT.  It had house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam frisée, pimento cheese and pickled lemon vinaigrette.  I really don't know what all of those ingredients were, but whatever they were, this was an appetizer full of flavor.  I wish they would have sold this appetizer by the dozen instead of having only a few of them.  I then had the chicken and waffles with macaroni and cheese and collard greens for my main course.  The chicken was fried perfectly. The mac and cheese with bacon also had an unbelievable flavor. This was some of the best fried chicken and macaroni and cheese that I have ever had in my life and I am from the great state of Texas.   The waffles and regular maple syrup were spot on.  They also had some ""real"" collard greens.  People from the south know what real collard greens are because they have that authentic collard green smell.  The only thing that tasted a tad funny was the watermelon.  It had an unusual flavor. I also liked that the management of the restaurant came by our table more than once to make sure everything was ok.

I had the burger, and I tasted the mac & cheese and shrimp & grits. I also heard wonderful things about the chicken from other members in my party. The ambiance is dimly-lit and trendy casual with plenty of lounge-style seating. Very country chic. 

There are some things to keep in mind. We came with a large party (over 10) without any reservations and had to split our party in two and sit in the lounge or else wait a pretty long time. So, if you plan on coming with a lot of people, definitely try to make a reservation. 

Also, a lot of the menu items include pork or are cooked in pork fat (like the chicken). This turned out to be a problem, because it's not always explicitly stated on the menu. If you don't eat pork, be sure to advise your server. When our server, Steve, was made aware of this, he went above and beyond to make things right, which was very much appreciated!

They didn't come with the house pickles as I see in pictures from other Yelpers, so it looks like they have taken those away.  The disappointing thing is that they weren't chicken breast, like most good chicken biscuits.  One was breast and one was thigh.  Ugh, I wish they would say that in advance.   At $14 for two, it is just way overpriced for what you get.  Cocktails are good, but they should be at $14.

My friend and I were on a girls trip and had dinner at Yardbird based on the reviews.  I will have to say that the reviews were correct. I made a reservation in advance and would recommend that you do so.  There were quite a few people waiting and just leaving because the wait time was pretty long.

We shared biscuits, Lewellyn's fried half chicken, mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. Now, I am typically no fan of the sprouts, but the way that they were prepared was not like any Brussels sprouts my mama ever forced me to eat.  Honey glazed and crispy (yummy).  Everything else was really good as well.  We also split (though it was just gluttony at that point) a huge slice of butterscotch cake with bacon frosting, butterscotch sauce, vanilla ice cream . . . I was like yes to all of that and kept eating despite the fact that my stomach was screaming for my stop. I convinced myself that the food would be a good ""base"" for the cocktails I would have later . . . I would suggest sharing the food with more than one other ""lady.""  We barely made a dent in anything, except that my sprouts loving friend finished them off.

The first event was a mixer with drinks, DJ QuestLove spinning tunes and some of their favorite dishes being passed around. There was even a red carpet and a photo booth. The second event on the following day was a pre fixe menu brunch.

The samples of food that I tried were a square of watermelon, fried chicken and biscuit sandwich with a spicy honey sauce, fried chicken piece on a waffle with maple syrup, fried green tomato with thick cut bacon on top plus greens and a vinaigrette drizzle and a few deviled eggs.

Brunch the next morning was a sampling of a fruit parfait with granola and yogurt, fried green tomato tapas with thick cut bacon and a generous amount of their chunky spicy chipotle sauce, eggs benedict with a bacon and biscuit crumble covered in eggs over easy and hollandaise sauce. Finally, a chocolate coffee cake was delivered for dessert.

The fruit parfait included a generous amount of fruit, granola and yogurt which were all tasty. The fried green tomato was nice and crispy. The bacon on top was good and so were the greens. However, the chunky chipotle sauce was overwhelming and not needed on an otherwise well executed dish. I found the eggs benedict to be spot on with that southern style coming through with the bacon and biscuit crumble. I would have liked more bacon, yum. I haven't had too many coffee cakes for dessert, but the plating looking very cool with chocolate sauce, sprig of mint and a well placed blackberry. The cake itself was marbled. It wasn't moist, but that could be how coffee cakes are? On a cake hardness scale between angel food to scone, the hardness of the coffee cake was closer to scone.

I'd go back again for brunch to see what new dishes that the chef creates. My favorite of the samples I tried on the first night was the fried chicken on waffle.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,1,1,4,H6ZbJNPzhFtTcBeELh7m7g

The server (Mikayla) greeted me within a minute if sitting down and took my drink order. Definitely try the blackberry lemonade - so good - especially with the whiskey :).

I ordered the half fried chicken (I mean why would you get anything else when this place is known for it...it's called Yard Bird for a reason). I also asked for recommendations on sides and the server recommended the Brussels Sprouts - heck yeah I love Brussels Sprouts. I saw a biscuit appetizer on the menu but it had 4 biscuits. I politely asked if I could get a single biscuit since I was rocking solo and the server said no problem. I saw good review on the buttermilk ranch that comes with the fries so ordered that to try with the Brussels Sprouts. 

Wow the food came out fast, it was like they were just waiting to drop my order. No joke, it was out within 7 minutes when generally that's faster than most app standards and half as long as most entree times. Chicken? Check. Biscuit? Check. Brussels sprouts? Check.

 The chicken was piping hot and the person who served it to me described the dish as brined for 27 hours. I liked that touch. The skin wasn't as crispy as I had expected but it was flavorful and crisp. The meat just fell off the bone. Usually I struggle to try and get to all the meat when I eat bone-in chicken, but not tonight. There was not a single piece of meat left on those bones. Nothing is safe from this savage when he's hungry.

The Brussels Sprouts were cooked perfectly too. Nice crisp to them and fully cooked and tender. The spiced honey that they were drizzled in was a nice kick up a notch than what I'm used too. I gotta say, even though I bucked the system and ate against the grain of the Chef's intention, the ranch went well with the Sprouts. The biscuit was buttery and crispy just like I like em. It was a decent size, not overly large but not too small. Think smaller than a hockey puck. The butter and jam that were served with the biscuit was phenomenal too. I prefer butters at room temperature and spreadable - this was. The jam was tasty and homemade - you can def taste the heart and love in this food.

Teamwork among he staff was observed throughout my meal. When servers were busy at other tables, bussers greeted and took water orders (tap or bottles). The manager made an appearance at my table and asked how things were. Awesome. Timing for drinks and food orders/receipt and check backs were within expected and preferred times.

Fried Chicken: breaking easily falls off the chicken, which I hate since I end up only eating the breading or the naked chicken, and the skin isn't quite crispy. True Southerners consider this sloppy.

Never seen a southern cuisine restaurant in Vegas so decided to try this place... it is located inside the Venitian... 

Service was great... no complaints...

Lemonade was a too sweet, the waiter changed the order for a sweat tea (much better choice).... 

Got the mac n cheese, in which was very flavorful topped with maybe brown sugar?? It had a sweet crust on top... but it was good...

Ordered the Okra with cojita cheese and butter... very tasty if you like Okra...

Ordered home made biscuits with Brisket... the brisket is marinated in bbq sauce... also tasty!! 

And the ribs??!! We're pretty good, juicy and meat comes right off the bone!!!... do I need to say more???.. nope...

Fried Green Tomato BLT (5/5)
I've never had fried green tomatoes before and man was it amazing. The coating on the outside is so crisp without cooking the tomato. Paired with the fatty piece of pork belly and it was a heavenly bite! One order comes with 3 pieces. 

Biscuits (4/5)
Some of the fluffiest biscuits ever! They still tasted great the next morning after being microwaved at the hotel which says a lot.

Chicken n Waffles (4/5)
The chicken is definitely good, but nothing that completely blew me away. It is a bit pricey at $36 too. The honey hot sauce though pairs with it really well!

Black Bourbon Lemonade (4/5)
I'm not a huge cocktail person, but this drink caught me by surprise! It had no strong after taste and paired really well with the BLT to cut down on the fattyness. I definitely preferred this to the watermelon sling

Watermelon Sling (2.5/5)
If you are going to order a cocktail, definitely get the bourbon lemonade. I just wasn't a huge fan of the watermelon and eventually just traded with my boyfriend who got the lemonade. 

Overall, everything was tasty, but the BLT was the true winner. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Vegas. Just remember to make a reservation. I was told a walk in was around 50 minutes.",gbUp4VpjdGymA7og0F11aQ,1,0,4,CfJ4cRF2Z2mwdBK-SjHebw

Being from KY, I would hope that I know what fried chicken is!  No, I am not talking about KFC, either.

Yardbird is pretty good.  I particularly liked that their chicken seemed to be brined or marinated and had an excellent flavor.  If I could make any improvements on the chicken, I wish it were crispier in terms of the breading!  The sauces that accompany the chicken (maple bourbon and honey hot sauce) really compliment the chicken.  Highly recommend each of them!

What we had:
- Chicken, watermelon 'n' waffles: pretty good.  Chicken is as described as above.  Waffle was freaking awesome... I have never had a savory waffle, but they nailed it!

- Macaroni and cheese- get it!
- Peach cobbler dessert- hefty price tag at $25 for a dessert that you could split between 3 people.  However, if you want some REAL tasty peaches, go to Georgia.  You will never want peaches anywhere else!

We were blessed to experience service from Tracy (AKA Hatch) on this visit, and we allowed him dictate our entire meal. As such, we started off with a Yardbird Old fashioned and a Southern Revival cocktail. The Old fashioned was boozy, but accented with maple syrup for a unique taste. The Southern Revival was special though--passion fruit meets whiskey in a perfect combination. Immediately following our drinks, the signature Fried Green Tomato BLT came out. This is a signature item for a reason. If you remotely enjoy fried green tomatoes then you would do well to try this. 

Our experience of signature items continued as we shared the Shrimp 'N' Grits and their world famous Fried Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. These are both standout dishes, but side-by-side the chicken received a lot more love from both of us...succulent, juicy, moist, 27-hours-worth-of-brining flavorful, and encased in a perfectly crispy skin, this chicken is no joke. It carries a hefty price tag, but it's also absolutely freakin' delicious! The shrimp 'N' Grits were one of the better version you will find. The grits are treated with a pbr chicken jus that ties in wonderfully with the fresh seafood flavors of the shrimp. 

Our evening finished with the Velvet & Berries: red velvet cheesecake with sweet macerated berries and a cream cheese mousse. The red velvet cheesecake is spot-on, but the cream cheese mousse is ridiculously good.

Sometimes it's like they say, ""Second time's a charm."" ...on my first visit, I came here with friends for Yardbird's famous Fried Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. We ended up sharing that as well as Deviled Eggs, Mama's Biscuits, Mac n Cheese, Country Pork Terrine, Short Ribs, Peach Cobbler and a few other smaller items. The Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles was the best item of the evening, but there was not a lot of chicken to go around for four people. In general, everything was good but did not leave the lasting impression that I encountered on my second visit. Both occasions confirmed that Yarbird is elevated comfort food...but that chicken...5 stars for the Fried Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles as well as the outstanding service of Hatch. Hatch could make you feel welcome in a viper pit, but his charm wasn't required to convince us that Yardbird Southern Table & Bar is an excellent choice!",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,22,25,5,FGMv39oK-QG5TEoDeHm46g

My sister had a list of new restaurants to try out in Vegas and this one caught my eye.  I love me some Southern food!  We started with the Pork Croquette, which the hubs loved.  Great pork flavor and some good smoked ham!  We also had the Farmers Cheese and Watermelon app. Nothing to write home about, but tasty.  The main star of the evening was the Fried Chicken!!  So yummy!!  It ranks right up there with the Nashville Fried Chicken at the Fremont Diner in Sonoma, CA (which is the absolute best!).  We also had the Biscuits and Mac n Cheese.  Hubby and I agreed they were the BEST biscuits we've ever had.  The Mac N Cheese was super tasty as well!!

We wanted to try the Crunch N Munch bread pudding but our server recommended the Deep Fried Oreos and we were not disappointed!!  They were crunchy, tasty and a great sweet treat!

If you love fried chicken with a super crispy skin, this isn't the place. The chicken was juicy but the flavor was ok at best. The watermelon cubes was the best part of the dish. The waffles were soft and did not have a crunchy exterior. I know I won't be craving to come back for the fried chicken and waffles. The best part about Yardbird is the service.

The portions for some of the plates are quite big, they had suggested that dishes should be shared. 

I ended up getting the brisket biscuits which were very good! I loved the BBQ sauce and it was the perfect size, very much like sliders. In addition,  I ended up getting the cauliflower mash, they were delicious! If someone didn't tell me they were made from cauliflower, I wouldn't have been able to tell. 

I ended up getting two whiskey's as well, which I loved. One was Oban ( a fav) and another was their own Whiskey made in Vegas, though it was pricey $30! It was not a big pour at all like the waiter said. In addition this place is known for the Whiskey and Bourbons etc. the waiter was not knowledgeable at all, he had to ask the bartender.

The staff are all really friendly and helpful. We started with the deviled eggs... nothing to complain about here! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly. Not too crazy about the limp waffles or the fried chicken biscuits. The biscuits seemed heavy and had honey or something on them, which wasn't too great with the soggy-crusted chicken inside. This may be a matter of acquired taste, however, for people who are from the South! I really thought the best thing here was the spicy bloody mary.... I could have had a few of these! My dining partner had the banana pudding, which got high raves as well. I'd like to come back and try the shrimp and grits.",z9tmLqpO-eJe0wSL0kEdTw,0,0,4,qC5ekT_jXD94YeRPaHr54Q

2600242,2017-05-03,24,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Fried chicken is a crispy, juicy, and tender guilty pleasure I have no problem succumbing to. Yardbird Southern Table & Bar boldly declared that they had one of the best fried chicken recipes out there, so to put them to the test, my family and I made reservations here for Sunday night dinner. It was very last minute, but the hostess kindly accommodated our large group without a fuss. 

The restaurant itself is cozy yet classy at the same time. Like most Vegas restaurants, the lighting is low and creates an intimate mood that would be nice if the volume wasn't eardrum-breaking loud. At one point, I felt as if I was in a shouting match with my family. We sat at a high table with comfy bar stools while behind us were parties sitting on plushy couch seats, enjoying a nice cocktail or glass of wine. 

The menu is constructed like a flip book with one page dedicated to food and the other four to various types of liquid courage. Because we were still quite full from our late lunch, my family and I decided to eat food family style. For our appetizers, we got the deviled eggs, mango grilled salad, and crab mac and cheese, then for our entrees, we shared the crispy fried chicken with hot sauce and the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles. 

While service is friendly, there was no denying that it was slow. The wait times between each appetizer and between each course was uncomfortably long. When all the appetizers finally hit our table, we did agree that plating was nice. The creamy yolk of the deviled eggs appeared like a yellow beehive and it was easy to eat in a single bite. It was the favorite appetizer of the three. As for the salad, I had to cut up the lettuce leaves with a knife while the mango pieces were way too mushy. The mac and cheese tasted decent overall, but the cheese was slightly congealed. 

Hoping the entrees would be better, we were at first very impressed with the look of the fried chicken, especially the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles dish. I think that dish is always meant to be shared because it is a monster of a plate. You get an entire, thick waffle, four pieces of fried chicken, and spicy watermelon pieces. As for the regular fried chicken entree, there were three pieces served in an iron basket. 

There is no denying that the chicken was juicy. UNBELIEVABLY JUICY. The flavors were vibrant and the meat fell apart with ease. But one of the best things about fried chicken is the skin, and unfortunately at Yardbird's, the skin was not crispy at all. Even though it was nicely spiced, the lack of a crunch was quite a crime.

In the end, we still had room to order dessert so we got the banana bread pudding to share that was neatly presented in a mason jar with a hill of Chantilly cream and a crispy banana chip. I loved the bread pudding, tasting surprisingly light with plenty of banana flavor. The only change I would make is to have less of the cream since it eventually overpowered the entire dish. 

Like most Vegas restaurants, prices aren't the most reasonable, but for good flavors, sometimes the wallet pain is worth it. I can't say that that is the case for Yardbird. The chicken was good, just not great, and the service was friendly, just not efficient. 

I guess the whole experience was just average for us.",mEbbDKGEtz5yRiE_S0Fpfg,35,36,3,PL2Nf-U61j1-SDCbhP_HDg

We were seated at our table and we asked what's good, James our server had great recommendations for us.  He was great so attentive and made sure we were happy.

So I made a reservation for four @ 9:30 on a Saturday night and when got there surprisingly it wasn't crowded. (the crowd came after we were leaving which was around 10:30ish, then it was busy!)  so the host was very nice and friendly, and I told her about my reservation and she was happy to seat us 15 mins early. 

The way this place is set up is, when you enter it's dark like a lounge, there isn't like normal chairs and tables setup. So I thought to myself, well alright, I don't mind trying this out, but we were taking to the back and then it looked like a regular restaurant, lights were bright, normal chairs and tables. 

So we were looking here on yelp for anything that stood out to us and I saw a pic of the watermelon with fried chicken. I wanted it right away lol. Plus our server is that was one of their most popular dishes. Our server was nice, friendly, very positive. I really liked her. It's called Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles.

Wow!! That was amazing! Just thinking about it right now, I want it!! The pieces were BIG! We got five big pieces of spiced watermelon, four big pieces of fried chicken, a whole waffle that's fold in half to make four pieces. It comes with syrup and honey hot sauce which is amazing! I didn't like the texture of the waffles though. To me it was overdone. I like my waffles soft and not where I need to keep chewing on it. So that wasn't fun. That watermelon was my favorite!!! Juicy, with some spice and it went really well with the chicken. The chicken was good too. It wasn't dry, it was crispy and oh how I wish I could have more now!

The ambiance of the place is cute but loud, and the bar areas are a little impractical with the low chairs and basically coffee tables. Eating my biscuit was fine there, but it would have been awkward to bend down and eat if I had soup or something that required a fork.

My group had a really nice brunch here - we all enjoyed our food, it wasn't *too* pricey (relative to Vegas), it was in our hotel, reservations were easy, and the service was great.

RESERVATIONS: Made for 10 about a month in advance for 11am on a Saturday. I called at 11am that morning to change it to 11:30am, and they were fine with that. In fact, it felt kind of empty there with plenty of tables open throughout our brunch.

THE SERVICE: Friendly, prompt. Overall great!

THE COST: $400 total (including tax/tip) for 10 people. We got lots of sides, entrees, and drinks.

MUST-HAVES: Fried Green Tomato BLT for its uniqueness, Mini Bacon Doughnut, some form of the Fried Chicken.

THE FOOD: See my photos for additional details on the dishes below!

* Southern Revival (Wild Turkey 81, passion fruit, basil. $14) - 4 stars
Recommended after I said I like something ""light and refreshing."" This was perfect!

SMALL SHARES
* Fried Green Tomato BLT (pork belly, greens, tomato jam, house-made pimento cheese. $14) - 4.5 stars
Very unique! A really interesting take on a BLT, and it's really not like eating a BLT because everything's rearranged (and a really good way). The crunch to the fried tomato is intense and delicious.

* Deviled Eggs (fresh chives, smoked trout roe 'redneck caviar'. $10) - 4 stars
This had unique flavors and a variety of textures. Very tasty!

THE BIRD
* Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (1/2 free range bird, '27-hour recipe', honey hot sauce. $26) - 4.5 stars
Excellent fried chicken, and many pieces to share with the group! I love the breading - a thin layer of crisp on top of very moist meat.

* Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles (signature 'old school fried chicken', honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, bourbon maple syrup. $36) - 4.5 stars
The chicken was great. The watermelon was old - lacking that crispness to a perfectly ripe watermelon (also the spice wasn't really there). The waffles were great (didn't taste the cheese). You get 3 things in one! Albeit it's quite pricey.

ODDS AND ENDS
* Skillet Cornbread (cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, maple butter. $9) - 3.5 stars
This was good, but it could've be more moist & flavorful.

* Mini Bacon Doughnut (maple glaze, bacon, butterscotch dipping sauce. $8) - 4.5 stars
Very tasty and rich! Definitely the soft yeast donut style, with stretchy dough. It's almost too rich with the dipping sauce, so start light with that to see what you can handle!

TODAY'S SPECIALS
* Smoked Brisket (picked onions and cucumbers, tomato jam, house bbq. $15) - 3 stars
The brisket was quite dry and flavorless. I wouldn't recommend getting this one!

* Country Ham (Vermont cheddar. $15) - 3.5 stars
This looks impressive, and the biscuit is moist and the piles of cheese tasty. However, what should be star of this dish - the meat - is quite lackluster.",eIa4QJXp5ZNmuFORnuPvDA,6,2,4,lyp5OE4g_ovCxsztXnc1HQ

2641979,2015-03-08,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I love southern food and have always wanted to try Yardbird in Miami so Yardbird LV was a no brainer for my birthday dinner this year.  Opentable showed them as booked but we called the restaurant and were able to get a reservation.  We arrived and were seated right away at a corner booth.  Service was fair.  There were a few hiccups, wrong drinks brought (on receipt said guest changed mind), had to ask for silverware multiple times (5 of us but only setup for 4).  They asked when making the reservations if we were celebrating anything but no mention of my birthday during dinner.  Not a big deal, but kinda funny to ask and then nothing.  Food was good but not as amazing as we anticipated.   

Cocktails: Watermelon Sling and Southern Peach.  Both good and very strong. 

Apps: Deviled Eggs and Fried Green Tomato BLT.  I've never met a deviled egg i didn't like....until now.  They were extremely dry and tasted old.  Way to much dill for me.  Fried green tomato BLT on the other hand was great.  

Entrees:  Shrimp n Grits, St Louis Style Spare Ribs and Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles.  Shrimp n grits are my favorite food.  Anytime they are on the menu I have to order them.  These were good.  I would def order again.  St Louis ribs were by far the best of everything we ordered.  Chicken, watermelon and waffles, what we were most looking forward to and was a bit of a disappointment.  It was ok, just not the best chicken we ever had by a long shot.  The chicken was juicy but a little seasoning or spice would have went a long way.  Waffles and watermelon were ok but we weren't wowed by them.  

Sides:  Mac n Cheese, House Cut Fries and Buttermilk Biscuits.  Mac n Cheese was another disappointment, runny and bland.  House cut fries were ok and biscuits were good.  

Dessert: Crunch n Munch Bread Pudding.  Very sweet and rich.  Popcorn ice cream was interesting.

I flew to Vegas on Allegiant and read about Yardbird in the in-flight magazine. I was stoked to chow down on Southern fare, the cuisine of my homeland (I'm from Atlanta).

I had a brisket sandwich, which was awful. The meat was fatty (and NOT in a good way), stringy and chewy. The BBQ sauce was cloyingly sweet and one-note. 

I also had the fried green tomato BLT. We expected a sandwich, but it was just 3 thick slices of tough, chewy underseasoned tomato on a plate topped with tasteless pimento cheese. (How can you mess up something as glorious as pimento cheese, y'all?!)

I didn't taste any South in my mouth. Only bright spot of the meal was the cocktail, which was stellar.

Tried out 3 different small plates. 

1st the deviled eggs. 4 halves for 11$ decent tasting but lots of dill and pretty frugal portion i thought. 

2nd quail under a brick. 17$ for rubbery meat, there was chicken liver mixed in with the rice and the mix of mushrooms throughout the dish just gave too many competing flavors. 

3rd bone marrow. I liked this one the best, the bacon onion relish used to garnish goes nice with the bone marrow. It was nice and rich and everyone you want from bone marrow.

Yes the food was good and the service amazing. But $38 for chicken and waffles is just a bit high even for amazing chicken. It should be closer to $28-34 tops. $11 for some biscuits as well should be max $9. 

The food is heavy so don't eat and plan going out. If you do eat light. The chicken was cooked perfectly as well as the biscuits and waffles. The sweet iced tea was on spot which is hard to find west of Texas. I'm from the south born and raised so I can vouch for the chicken and tea here. Friends have said rest of the food is great also. 

The service was perfect. Always on their toes and very friendly. 

Only reason I took away one star was the price. Really needs to come down. $5 for a beer (perfect price) $38 for chicken (too high).",gr163FzX9o2HS6EBfm1s-g,0,0,4,lsDdrIvgdR9gmPvYy7eSrw

Let me say that she didn't disappoint. My work team said, we are going where you are going, so we decided to check out Yardbird. It was four in our group, so I reserved a table for dinner in advance during the day. This place pumps out some excellent food, so I would definitely make reservations, so you wont get denied or have to wait a while. The good thing about my work team are that they are open minded eaters and we all decided to try different things and share them with each other. For the appetizers we ordered the Smoked Brisket biscuits, which were absolutely delicious! The brisket melted in your mouth, stuffed inside warm buttermilk biscuits, how can you go wrong with that combo. The smoked brisket biscuits came with pickled onion, cucumber and house made bbq sauce. Next were the Black angus burnt ends which included blue cheese, tator-tots and pickled chillies. Another great combo creation! The flavors all went well together. The burnt ends were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside accompanied with the tator-tots and throw in the flavor of the blue cheese. WOW! 

Next the Mac N Cheese was made with trattole pasta and five cheeses with a crispy herb roast. OMG.. this was absolutely delectable. Even if you don't like Mac N Cheese you have to try this, trust me you wont be disappointed. Also not to make the review too long the Grits and Crispy Brussels with honey were amazing as well. The main attraction was the Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon, weird combo I know, but the chicken came with honey hot sauce which was house made, chilled spiced watermelon, the waffle was made with vermont sharp cheddar cheese and house made bourbon maple syrup.

Excellent service - Our server recommended the Chicken N' Waffles N' Watermelon and I decided to get the Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad. Our waiter was really nice and our water cups were always filled.

The Food - The food was amazing. The salad was really good, but the star of the show was the chicken and waffles. So the chicken was cooked perfectly - juicy, tender and full of flavor. The skin was crispy and just oooo so good! The waffles were out of this world delicious and the syrup (which we think had some rum in it), was smooth and a nice compliment to the dish. The watermelon seemed like it was marinated in some type of sauce that just went really well with the entire dish. 

The mango salad was fresh, crisp, and full of nuts and berries. It complimented the chicken nicely.

Then we got the peach cobbler for dessert. It took about 20-30 minutes to come out but that's because they make it to order!

Moist, tender, and a nice crispy skin that is oh so good. Their hot sauce is also tasty and not really spicy at all (mild at best), so you can indulge without having a glass of milk on standby.

Did I mention that it is a HUGE chicken? They claim their chickens are free range and steroid free, but I will need to see a drug test, lol. Unless these Yardbirds spent all day lifting weights, I don't know how they are so big. Nevertheless, it is plenty of chicken and a decent value.

We also had the cornbread and the blistered tomatoes. I liked the cornbread?, but then? tomatoes were a miss for me flavor wise.

Finally, desert here is equally enormous and delicious. The salted caramel bread pudding was fantastic, and the butterscotch cake was enormous and easily could have been for 2 people.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,1,1,5,6EWHgQBs52P0SNMKmhkiVw

My server Matt made awesome recommendations and when I told him I prefer dark meat fried chicken because I usually find white meat dry, he brought me out a chicken breast with my order just for me to try. So right there, the dude won major points!

As for the food....lord have mercy! The deviled eggs were tasty. Nothing to write home about but not disappointing. But the goddamn mac-n-cheese and fried chicken?!?!?? Let me just say this, if I did a armed bank robbery with the mac-n-cheese and chicken, and we all got caught, I would plead guilty and take the rap, these things are so amazing. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and moist (yeah I hate that word too). The mac n'cheese appetizer is perfectly sized and the mix of cheese that's both baked & ""liquidy"" is excellent.

The skin was crackle-crisp and deep golden brown, with dark meat so tender that the juices ran when I cut into the meat. The spiced watermelon didn't do much for me but the biscuit was soft and flaky (combined with honey butter- to die for).

My boyfriend and I came here for a weekend brunch after hearing raving reviews, so I made reservations ahead of time.  We got sat right away and I instantly liked the atmosphere of the place.  Our waiter came around and talked about the specials and the most popular items.  We opted for the street corn ($12) and the blue plate special ($16) and I was so happy with my food.  The blue plate special came with a yummy biscuit, 4 pieces of their seasoned watermelon, and 2 large pieces of their signature fried chicken.  It was more than enough food for 1 person and didn't break the bank.  The corn was an awesome side dish for the chicken.  The servers came around the folded our napkins whenever we left for the bathroom and always filled our water when it was only half gone.

Christina, Christina, Christina! This girl greeted both my husband and I with the warmest smile. I'm all about getting the welcomed feeling when I go somewhere to dine; I don't like feeling like I'm just another table to turn for a tip. 

Being it was our 1st time here, she made great recommendations and we gladly took her suggestions. She was on top of game with her attention she was giving to us and making sure we didn't need anything else. 

Let's talk about the food: 
OMG! We started off with the BBQ Brisket Biscuits. These little suckers were delicious! The brisket was cooked to perfection! The dish come with 2 biscuit sandwiches. So I would only recommend it if you're going to eat alone or with one other person.  My husband ordered the Swine Burger and I ordered the Chicken & Waffles. The plates come well portioned, you can even say they are shareable. 

Over all, I LOVED this place. Christina made it so worth coming to the strip on a Friday night (we're locals and prefer to stay off the strip on the weekends) Best server on Earth!!!!",U28VstjRdxyoTp423t5JcA,0,0,5,uHsgljgZEkeMCmAO55JFEA

The only complaint i have was I ordered a peach drink (can't remember the name) and it was extremely weak, like i question whether there was even any alcohol in it. Other than that, the mac and cheese was to die for! I also had the caesar salad which was a pleasant surprise and much better than one would expect for a salad. My mother ordered the chicken and waffles and stated that was equally as delicious. For dessert we had the peach cobbler and the red velvet cheesecake. Both were AMAZING, like really really good! At the end of our meal, Stephen, the manager, came over and chatted us up for at least a good half an hour. He seemed really genuine and took time to get to know us.

I couldn't wait to get to Yardbird after reading the reviews- and the food did not disappoint! A girlfriend and I had reservations on a Friday night around 8pm, and were taken back immediately to our two-top. The restaurant was busy but not packed, although we were seated quite close to two other tables and it was a little awkward getting in and out without shoving my butt in someone's face. Our server was odd from the get-go, dropping off menus and only making eye contact with my friend, speaking to her, and handing things to her. Perhaps he was particularly enamored with her, but it was like I did not exist. I had to get my menu from her after he handed her two, and then tell him that I too, wanted a cocktail, after he had taken her order. He didn't come back much throughout the rest of the evening, and it took us quite some time to get more water and the bill, but service aside, the food was phenomenal. 

Salivating, our eyes glazed over as we read the menu, and it was hard to narrow down our choices as we easily could have ordered everything. It all comes out as it's ready, so there really are no ""appetizers, mains"" etc., which is fun to share but we also quickly accumulated a table full of food that we couldn't keep up with, so the pacing might need some work. 

We had the FRIED PICKLES w/ aioli, which were long, crunchy spears- really delicious. The DEVILED EGGS are a must order, savory and plentiful, and I love the addition of dill. (Try pouring the hot sauce on them!) The FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were good, topped with pimento cheese, pork belly, and frisee. I wish there was more of a crunch aspect to this, as the tomato and cheese tend to blend together as one mushy texture, but still pretty tasty. By far, the best thing we had was the FRIED CHICKEN WITH CHEDDAR WAFFLES AND WATERMELON. Honest to god, the best fried chicken I've ever had, with the best hot sauce I've ever had. I believe they brine it for 48 hours. The waffle, which I usually don't love because they are too sweet, was savory, with cheddar baked in, and was topped with a fresh and spicy pepper salsa/relish. Big cubes of watermelon were on the side with some sort of thyme garnish, and man..so good. I dug right in and ate with my hands- which is how you eat fried chicken- but you will get stares if you do this. I had a whiskey cocktail with passion fruit puree and basil that was pretty tasty- and considering what it usually costs to eat on the Strip, this was a good deal. I usually leave restaurants like this feeling disappointed by mediocre food and a huge bill but this was worth every penny and I can't wait to go back.",bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ,2,1,4,7cshuFkCbWQB-lVamxyW-g

Cons: pricy

Yardbird is located in The Venetian, which is great for people staying in the hotel. It also takes reservations so you don't have to wait to be seated. The front area is full of couches and high tables, while the back has more seating for when the restaurant is full.

I had the deviled eggs and crispy chicken biscuits. I also saw a lot of people getting mimosas and other drinks when I went at 11AM (welcome to Vegas!) The eggs were good, but not great - they're presented beautifully and I love the roe on top. The chicken was moist and the biscuits delicious, but the overall dish was on the drier side.

YB gets 5 stars for their amazing service. From the second we walked in, everyone was wonderfully pleasant and attentive. The server overheard us talking about our friend's birthday and he brought us a huge slice of chocolate cake without being asked.

The restaurants ambiance is Modern with cool Southern touches everywhere! Hostesses were super friendly & we were seated right away. 

Now, what made our whole night was the privilege/luck we had getting to meet our waiter, Mr. Tracy ( his name is Tracy, but we refer to him as 'Mr.' because he deserves that respect. I have NEVER, EVER in my life experienced service like I did from him that night!

He's just a doll- SO friendly & attentive throughout our meal! All of his suggestions were spot-on & he made sure we never wanted for anything. When I mentioned how we were just coming off an awful 3-day out of state weekend tournament & how sad my daughter was, he went out of his way to do something special for her that literally brought her to tears (& she NEVER cries, which made me cry!).

But to the food- it was an amazing meal! The Mac n' Cheese most definitely lived up to the hype!!! It's a small serving (like a side dish) so don't plan on getting one to share- you won't want to share it with anyone (LOL)!!!
We also had the fried green tomato BLT, cauliflower mashed potatoes, shrimp and grits, fried chicken, & biscuits. Everything was delicious! But do NOT miss the fried green tomato BLT- it was to die for!

When people complain that it's pricey I'll confirm that yes, it's not cheap- don't come here with the kiddos if you're not prepared to drop about $175/$200 for food/drinks/tip for a party of 5. 

But for our family it was definitely worth every penny. It wasn't just a meal, it was an amazing experience! Each of us will carry the memory of that delicious dinner & Mr. Tracy's  kind words & actions to our heartbroken child with us forever!",tCqLhaJmsrucFfk5w-fLnw,2,1,5,w6o1Zc4Txp1RE6tWbfMPkA

With it's rustic decor and furnishings you initially think your in a southern state at an authentic small town chicken restaurant.. But once you let your eyes settle you easily come to realize that although it gives off a old southern charm you are however in a new modern upscale take on a southern restaurant . 

I must admit Yardbirds got me with their chicken ads plastered all over Vegas Magazines and posters .. Slabs of fried delicious chicken pictures calling my name every time I saw it..  In my mind this is a fried chicken paradise that I must go to. 

So I made it here and with menu in hand...after drooling a bit in anticipation..my eyes start hunting for pages and pages of fried chicken options ..But  after a quick skim through the small one page menu one time, then two times,  I come to realize there menu choices on chicken consist of only 3 items..chicken BBQ .. Fried Chicken with waffles and fried chicken without waffles ..A bit disappointed I quickly sucked it up and placed an order .. So my choice was chicken and waffles which would come just as it states with a side or chilli spiced watermelon cubes and bourbon infused syrup.  First impressions of my plate was.. that's it?. Now Why would I say this in disappointment  .. Maybe because i frequent hash house a go go and used to the giant portions or it could be that for $36 I expected more than 4 pieces of fried chicken..hmmm this upscale thing is not working at this moment for me..

However I wasn't initially impressed at this point, I kept on trucking and then I dug into this moist delicious perfectly fried chicken and all my impressions went out the door.. Yes people the chicken is delicious one of the best I have had.. The waffles to die for with their bourbon infused syrup.. I could drink that if It came in a bottle.. So good.. Spiced watermelons was a nice finish to clean the palate.. This all came with average service, with no extra effort made to take them over the top and truely call them selves upscale.

Yardbirds doesn't stop at the chicken.. You can not only eat here but you can drink well too ..Because they have a fierce bar and lounge scene , specializing in bourbon and whiskey...What makes this bar a little different is that they hand harvest there ice cubes which include handmade flavored ice cubes.. So in your drinks expect to get interesting shaped and flavored ice cubes.. Average drink cost is about 15 dollars and goes up so bring lots of money.. Remember this is upscale southern....right

Overall yardbirds took me up and back down and back up.. This roller coaster of emotions eating here did end on a high note with good flavors and Good drinks.. Am I sold on the upscale southern dining approach, not really ..",zL_GY1IyrdmLCk1ldcbAlw,14,16,4,kEZgMhzS2DxGLjyglJPcyQ

The décor and ambience is very inviting and welcoming. My friend best described it as country chic and that is Yardbird in a nutshell.

I ordered the Watermelon Sling and it was both refreshing and delicious. The Bourbon was definitely the star of the cocktail and the fresh watermelon juice added a subtle freshness to it.

Skillet Cornbread - The honey butter definitely makes this dish shine. You cannot beat corn bread made with real corn pieces baked into it. It was had a nice sweetness and smokiness to it. Baking it in the skillet gave it a nice crust on the sides and bottom.

Mac & Cheese - The dish was a little heavy on the cheddar cheese and I was kind of hoping for another type of cheese to balance it out, but it was overall a very tasty and filling dish. The panko bread crumbs on top finished the dish perfectly, adding a nice texture and saltiness to it.

Fried Chicken - One of the best fried chicken I have ever had. This is the reason you come to Yardbird and believe me you will not be disappointed. The only thing you that you would probably regret is if you don't order enough of it.

This is definitely a place you should check out, even with all of the choices you have in Vegas. For those on the East Coast, there's the one in Florida.",UExHHTOBS6gMkPivx5r_9A,1,1,5,IRS6SyeW0szAnNWNSOGqQw

I asked her to surprise me with a drink because there was so many options that looked amazing and she didn't not disappoint with the southern revival. It was a delicious blend of passion fruit and wild turkey 81 garnished with grapes and basil. That garnish really sealed the deal and made the drink a wonderful sensory experience. I wouldn't have normally gotten a drink like that but I'm so happy I did. 

On to the food, butter milk biscuits with homemade apple jam and home made butter they were so on point I wish I could eat them every day. The chicken and waffles were delicious also. I've never in my life had fried chicken as crispy and juicy as what they served up at Yardbirds. We ordered a few sides also with the chicken and waffles, Brussel sprouts (amazing), mac and cheese ( who can go wrong) and my personal favorite jalapeño corn bread!! All the items paired so well together the meal was truly amazing. 

The atmosphere was a little dark but it was cozy. We sat on the couches to eat and they were pretty comfortable aside from the tables not being big enough for all of our food. They have mason jar lights hanging they were pretty awesome to see the scene.

Sure there's plenty of places to eat a meal in Vegas. But no where on the strip are you going to have a meal that is as amazing as the one you'll have a yardbirds. Walk the extra few hotels to get to this restaurant, you absolutely will not be disappointed. They'll send you home wishing for the next time you can take a seat at their tables.

I mean, you're traveling all the way out here, you're looking to spend some money, and you're in one of the top foodie cities in the country so you want to eat really well. I am here to tell you that you are in the right place! Yardbird was my favorite meal in Vegas, hands down. I read the reviews, looked at the menu, and hoped it would be a good spot. But I didn't think it would be mind blowing - I mean, it was like fried chicken and comfort food. How mind blowing could it be? 

It was. Mind. Blowing. I'm telling you, I literally didn't talk the entire meal. We sat in silence, and in awe of what we were eating. 

We decided to share the chicken and waffles ($36), and sides of mac & cheese and crispy brussels sprouts ($10 each). It was still way too much food for the both of us. The flavors were amazing, and everything was cooked very well. The drink menu is very heavily bourbon and whiskey leaning! It totally fits with the theme of the restaurant, but don't go in expecting a fruity frozen margarita. There's also a very decent beer list, and all draft beers are local from Nevada! I can't remember what my guy had, but I had a delicious bourbon cocktail with white peach puree and fresh lemon and thyme called the Southern Peach. Drinks were expensive, as they all are in Vegas, so I only had one cocktail. :) But they all seemed delicious, and would run you approximately $14 a piece. All entrees are between $26 and $36. If my dish is any indication, the portions are ginormous. I would highly recommend sharing one entree and an appetizer and/or a side! Especially if you're on a budget. 

We sat at the bar, in the corner of the restaurant, so I can't comment too much on ambience. Service from the bartender was good, but I don't remember too much about it.

This modern rustic restaurant is located in the back section of the Venetian Resort on the north end of the strip. They are fairly popular so you may need reservations or a long wait during peak periods.

This is modern Southern cooking with fried foods and sweet drinks. The star is the fried chicken which is pampered and prepared beautifully to enjoy. The brining makes it juicy and tender with a great crust and flavor. The combination of fried chicken and watermelon is a bit of a stereotype, but it is hard to argue with the flavor especially combined with a decent, but somewhat underwhelming waffle. Try the chicken with different sides.

I had to order one of their specialty drinks, because Vegas sober is like fishing sober. I had a mason jar with whiskey and peach which was sweet and refreshing like a good Southern night. It is hard to drink too much with sweet drinks, so it helps temper the booze into a slow rush. They have a great selection of cocktails and would make a great place for just drinks and shared side dishes to start your Vegas night.

Yardbird is a nice option for the area and a good fit in the Venetian, which is already home to lots of great restaurants. It is rather pricy for the style of food, but you cannot compare it to your favorite chicken shack at home - both lose with that comparison.

My meal was so flavorful, the watermelon season with spices onset the whole meal. I would have licked my plate if I was home. My mom had the artichoke pasta and she really enjoyed all the flavors and it was fulfilling. I drank several bourbon blackberry cocktails and they will literally knock your socks off.
My whole reason to eat at Yard Birds was to meet Chef Ryan. I have never heard of the restaurant until learning about it on Hell's Kitchen. I am so glad Chef Ryan won. She was not there when we visited but we went the next day to see her. Chef Kim Ryan HK 16 winner was awesome to take a picture with me and talk with me.

The lady and I were staying at the Palazzo and looking for somewhere awesome to eat, and we found Yardbird which appealed to her southern tastes and my love for pretty much anything BBQed or fried.

The food is just insanely good.  We started with the fried green tomatoes which were perfect.  The pork belly was cooked just right and the tomatoes were so juicy.  She ordered the ribs and I got the fried chicken and both were so delicious we had to keep sharing with each other.  I also have to give a shoutout to the okra.  Probably the best I've ever had.  Just incredibly flavorful.  That's what literally everything we ate there was.  Straight flavor.  We could barely walk out of there afterwards.  Also, the blackberry bourbon lemonade.  Damn it's good.

Also, the service was top-notch, arguably the best I've received at any restaurant.  Carolina was a terrific, attentive server and chatted with my lady about being from Florida, and the manager stopped by as well to check on us.  

Overall we couldn't have been happier.  Yardbird definitely deserves the terrific reviews and the hype.  One of the best restaurants in Vegas.",h0doro2zV5ffcIAqhRNVNg,2,2,5,iP_c7wzMtVBdhRGkX0OBIw

Seating is what I call ""community style"", so, if you're searching for an intimate dining experience, this is not it. 

Good luck working your way through their whiskey and drinks list. So impressive! The butter lettuce and grilled mango salad was the best! It was big enough to share and while a little pricy, but I know for a fact that butter lettuce, or bib is very expensive. Mac & cheese was on point.

Started with the biscuits and brisket,  so good you'll close your eyes after taking the first bite. Next up was biscuits and chicken. My wife called it the best fried chicken she's had and I absolutely agree. Moist, great crunch and seasonings, wouldn't change a thing about the chicken. Finally fried green tomatoes with pork belly.

So, we made reservations to try out this restaurant since we had family in town.  We got seated and waiting 10, then 20 minutes before having anyone approach our table for water even.  I asked the hostess walking by for assistance and she was super apologetic and quickly got someone to serve our table right away.  The server took our order and gave us the perfect amount of attention--not too much or too little--but made sure we felt acknowledged and was quick with any requests we made.  The Restaurant Manager, Sean, stopped by our table and apologized yet again!  The fact that the hostess even brought this oversight to his attention was absolutely not necessary, but was just enough to win us over.  To know that this busy, successful restaurant actually cared enough to notify its manager, and for the manager to come and personally apologize, is what's missing in customer service these days.  He asked us if we wanted anything else like drinks or desserts.  We passed on both, but the server was insistent, and so we settled for the bread pudding.  Ok, so I forgot to talk about the food up to this point since I was blindsided by the amazing customer service.  It was DELICIOUS!!! I'm from the South and every piece of chicken, pork, and biscuit was perhaps one of the most delicious renditions I've ever tasted.  The icing on the cake? When we were ready to pay the bill, our server told us it was already taken care of and apologized yet again for the error.  We just couldn't stop talking about the great food and friendly service we received.  We will definitely be coming back soon!!!!",fFlY3v8WI79ksbwUEhQVuQ,1,1,5,u-Gr9LKtRmxGLpjbUa1i9g

I was going to kill some time gambling until I realized I left my cell phone at Harrahs before we walked over. We rushed back to see if we could find it. I called YB to explain what happened and that we would be late. They were super sympathetic and understanding and said they would gladly hold our table. We arrived at about 9:20pm all flustered and the hostess staff were really great about reassuring us that it wasn't a problem and were very happy I had found my phone. Well the service only got better from there.  Our server, Mikayla, was the best. The perfect blend of knowledge of the menu, attention to our needs, and friendly personality with a great sense of humor. She gave us great recommendations, which you totally need when you want to order everything on the menu. Highlights include Fried Green Tomato BLT, shrimp and grits, Brussel sprouts, biscuits with apple butter jam, and of course their phenomenal fried chicken. It was all sooooooo good!!!  If you don't like Brussel sprouts, you have to try YB's. They are crispy and delish and they cook it with honey which adds the perfect touch of sweetness to counteract the bitterness of this vegetable. Heaven!!  
But as good as the food was, I will never return to a place that has bad service. Well not only was Mikayla awesome but we observed excellent customer service throughout the restaurant. For example, there was a couple next to us who were halfway through their meal. We chatted a bit with them and got some feedback about what they ordered and how they liked it. Well when the food runner brought out our Fried Green Tomato BLT as a starter. The man said, ""What is that?"" The food runner told him and you could tell the man was really upset that he didn't see this item on the menu and was regretting that he hadn't ordered it. However by this time he was about 3/4 through their meal. Well five minutes later, that food runner came back with a small plate of just one fried green tomato BLT for the man and said it was ""compliments from the chef"". Well the man was thrilled and I thought ""Now that's how you take care of your guests.""  Very classy!!  But that was theme for the whole night, great atmosphere, delicious food and excellent customer service. Mikayla even compd our dessert.

This place has a great on line presence. They showed up in my Facebook feed, their ads were off to the side when I browsed the Internet.  Clearly it worked because here I sit.  

I could ramble on about the lack of warmth or friendliness from our server. I could lament the fact that the time between our appetizer and main course was excruciatingly long.  I could bemoan the fact that our waiter never once offered us another drink or asked us how our meal was. 

I could type all those things and more because I have been sitting waiting for my server to return and take my dessert order. 

What I will say is that the food is average to decent.  The portions are sizable and if you like bland food or have an aversion to seasoning, this is the place for you.

This is the restaurant I've been wanting to go since we got to Vegas in 2015 and haven't had chance, until Today, Christmas Eve in 2017.

So here's what I liked about it.

They take reservations. There maybe some restrictions on when they can accommodate that, but I know a lot of restaurant in Vegas that doesn't take reservations at all. So when I called and they took my reservation for 3, I was thrilled.

Hostess and servers; professional and friendly. I swear this is not just me being overly excited for visiting this restaurant but I sensed some southern flare from the hostess greeted us :D our server was very friendly yet polite, he knows how to make any guest feel comfortable.

Chicken; they use free-range chicken. Not your ole' Tyson's chicken. And they fry them to crispy perfection! With any of their chicken entree, they give you half a chicken. It was enough for 2 adults and 1 kid.

Waffle; they don't charge you $35 for a plate of chicken and waffle (with seasoned watermelon) for no reason. Their waffle was one of the fluffiest I've had. And that pairs wonderfully with their crispy fried chicken. Don't forget to try their house made bourbon infused syrup and honey hot sauce.

Dessert; I knew I had to taste butterscotch pecan cake. Bacon frosting, I mean, com'on! If you're in doubt, let me assure you, bacon flavor is very saddle, just a hint of it that adds extra layer of flavor to the rich butterscotch cake.


I cannot wait to go back, and I'm definitely sure I will go back, soon. There are so many dishes I really wanted to try but couldn't because it was just 3 of us. Their dishes are family style, so go here with big group and order different items to share! That's what I'll do next time :D",Zk7XnX8tVvJncQKa-9298A,1,1,5,yeRxXips2lyrXtYJ7Djr5g

2880319,2017-05-11,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"My pictures may not look like much, but this place is definitely a must-eat when in Vegas.  Even though it's just fried chicken and comfort food, there's nothing basic about it.  Everything is spiced and flavored just right.

The biscuits here are better than Popeyes!  And I love Popeyes' biscuits too.

The cauliflower mash taste just like mashed potatoes, but better.  I've had mashed cauliflower before at other places, and they taste like... mashed cauliflower.  Here though, they taste better than mashed potatoes.  Not sure how they made it so creamy and delicious.

The chicken itself is fantastic.  This isn't chicken you eat with ketchup.  You eat this as is, or with hot sauce because it's perfect the way it is.  I say it's comparable to putting A1 on a filet at a steak house, or putting ketchup on a hotdog -- you're not a little kid anymore, ketchup doesn't go on hotdogs....  

Grilled mango salad on butter lettuce and pecans... yes...  You need something fresh to balance out your meal, and this definitely did it.

The service was phenomenal as usual, which has been a reoccurring theme in Vegas since everyone hustles for tips.  What's also awesome about this place is how fresh everything is.  The biscuits are made on the spot, the jams and butter are too.  Plus, almost everything is organic.  I like this meal better than the buffets we ate at on this trip.

Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken was the least of my favorites here.  It was just ""meh.""  At $26 and 27 hours of brining, the fried chicken failed to delivery.  It really didn't taste any better than the flat battered chicken you get at a Ralph's deli.  At least that was my impression.  No crispy skin.  It just goes to show you, some recipes are best kept simple and straightforward.  
My favorite fried chicken ever was at  Blue Ribbon Sushi.  Yes, a Japanese restaurant with the best fried chicken.  Go figure.  

Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken:  C+, didn't care for the batter, and it was greasy

Short Rib:  A+, OMG, amazingly tender, beef with perfect bbq sauce.  Easily the best thing on the menu  

Smoked Backyard BBQ Chicken:  B+/A-,  PICK this chicken dish over the Fried Chicken.  Fantastic sauce, smokey and delicious.  And that charred okra - yum!

Mac and Cheese:   B+, pretty solid.

Skillet Cornbread:  C-,  I didn't like it.  Too dry for my tastes

Big parties must make reservations far in advance or it won't happen. We were lucky bc they have a bunch of couches with tables where they serve the full menu as well.  They happened to be empty when we arrived, so we grabbed one and cancelled our reservation.  

Service was good. 
Cocktails were creative and delicious.
Atmosphere is casual.
Price $$$
Food - pretty good.

- Deviled eggs: awesome. Ended up ordering a second plate, they were so good.
- Cornbread: moist, flavorful, served in a cast iron skillet with a fat pad of butter on top.  Old school, classic, great tasting.
- Fried green tomatoes with pork belly and pimento cheese: tomatoes were freaking fantastic - crisp and sweet!  pork belly was a little overdone, but good.  
- Mac & cheese: standard, nothing amazing.
- Brisket biscuits: these were very awesome.  Juicy, tender slabs of brisket on fresh baked southern styled biscuits.  Very good.  
- Fried chicken: 1/2 chicken with delicious breading, spicy, flavorful, juicy served with Louisiana hot sauce. 
- Raspberry cheesecake: not very good, wouldn't recommend
- Deep fried oreo: incredible.  can't go wrong when you bread anything with fried dough and serve with ice cream.  
- Butterscotch cake: not good, wouldn't recommend. served with a whiskey ice cream, which was okay.

We ordered the charred okra as well.  We were surprised to be delivered whole okra in a bowl.  It was ok.   Nothing special.  However, the cornbread is a different story.  The cornbread was served in a skillet, with melting honey butter on top.  It was moist, with little corn kernels inside. 
Definitely not for those on low card diet. 

Since it was my husbands birthday, we ordered a slice of butterscotch cake, mostly because we were curious how bacon frosting tasted.  A huge slice of cake was served to us.  It looked wonderful, surrounded by pecans on the bottom and in between the cake layers.  The cake and icing were non descript.  Nothing special, with just bleh flavor.

I had their ""Blue Plate Special"" (two pieces of Lewellyn's fine fried chicken, honey hot sauce
chilled spiced watermelon, house-made buttermilk biscuit) which was amazing. The chicken is brined for over 24 hours and is super moist. The batter was spot on.

I also tried half a ""Swine Burger"" (short rib, brisket, and chuck blend, house smoked pork belly, house pickles smoked gouda cheese, pickled onions, frisée). This was a delicious. There were so many flavors going on with each bite! Try it drizzled with their bourbon sauce

I had a little trouble finding this place, but you will find it after walking around the perimeter of the casino. I made a reservation about a week in advance because I knew Vegas would be very busy during EDC week. Our host was very sweet and helped us get settled comfortably. Our waiter was phenomenal! He was very polite, charming, and funny. Someone you would want to wait on you at any restaurant. As for the food, everything was delicious! Here is my take on all the food...

Fried chicken - a MUST try! Bird is so flavorful, tender, and crispy. The meat was moist. Even the white meat parts were moist. That is how you know it is done right! 

Waffles - It was cornmeal waffle so it was a little bit on the savory side. It was very light and airy. The waffle had a nice crunch on the outside, but still fluffy on the inside. Just the way it should be. 

Kale salad - crisp, refreshing, makes you feel less guilty for eating fried chicken 

House fries - seasoned well and had an amazing dipping sauce, however, I felt it was overpriced for the amount of fries they gave us

Brussels sprouts - crispy and glazed with this amazing sauce that makes you forget they were a vegetable. A must get for a side. 

Mud pie - Super awesome presentation! Beautiful looking dessert. I did not like the flower though. I think it was made of fondant and was very heard. The rest of it was a cool eating experience.

I was sold the moment I saw the fried green tomato BLT online prior to visiting. My initial plan was just to stop in for a few pieces of chicken and some fried green tomatoes but ended up ordering a mini feast for myself. Going through the menu I saw cheddar waffles...CHEDDAR WAFFLES!!! with spiced watermelon and chicken. I'm use to the traditional chicken and waffles so I had to give these waffles a try and I was blown away. DELICIOUS!!! Adding maple syrup to the waffles didn't take away from the cheddar flavor mixing quite well. I glanced at another table and saw the mac and cheese so of course I wasn't leaving without ordering some also.

Funny story for kicks. I came to Yardbird after drinking on the strip with a friend and ended up going into the restaurant next to Yardbird thinking it was Yardbird before realizing it wasn't. Ordered drinks and everything only to have to leave and go next door. This actually gave a couple of staff members who were very nice by the way at Yardbird a good laugh when telling the story.

Glad I finally made it to the correct restaurant and will be paying future visits because those chicken and waffles are awesome.

We started with the Deviled Eggs topped with Trout Roe. The eggs were creamy and very flavorful with Chives and Dill. The eggs were very flavorful and delicious!

I also got to try a little of the Black Angus Burnt Ends and Tator Tots. The Burnt Ends were caramelized and were full of flavor, tender and meaty. They were served over blue cheese fondue and were topped with pickled peppers that were sweet and spicy. The flavors going on in this dish were incredible. This dish had all kinds of things going on.

I had to try the Signature Dish...The Chicken ""N"" Waffles ""N"" Watermelon. The chicken is quality chicken that's marinated for about 27 hours. This was the best chicken and waffles I ever tried anywhere. The Chicken was so juicy and so flavorful. The honey hot sauce was an added bonus to the chicken. The Cheddar waffles were also so good but went into hyper-yumminess  with the bourbon maple sauce. So good! Watermelon was slightly seasoned and was very refreshing and seemed to lighten up a heavy meal. I do note the Chicken and waffles is a very large plate and could only eat half. They gave me a very large 1/2 chicken that was excellent.

My husband had to try the Peppered Gnocchi Pot Pie. I have to say the gnocchi in the pot pie were excellent with the correct texture. They also were delicious with lots of mushrooms and a sage gravy kind of sauce. The dish was topped with a yummy biscuit.

The service was really attentive and very efficient.

Felt like I walked into a completely different restaurant. First got the manager, Steve and assistant manager, Scott  who set me up and confirmed with my reservation. Greeted with nice hostess in the front who took us to our table, even though we were a bit late from the time we had reserved. The assistant manager, Sarah, came to greet us shortly after. 

Here's my take on our meal that we left into the hands of our expert waiter, Jerry-

The Welcome: 
-Biscuits came warm with the honey butter and jam that gave you the warm welcome to your belly.  

Drinks: 
-Southern Revival- the balance between the citrus and the mint was very refreshing and good counterpart to all the food to com. 
-Old Fashion- probably one of the best I've had. The maple syrup and bacon.. Mmm. Wow, the flavors.. just smell it. And I'm not even a bacon person! I appreciate the solid sphere ice cube that kept the drink cold through out my dinner for me to enjoy. 

Next up: 
-Fried Green Tomato BLT- crispy, full of flavor, fun dish
-Cheese and Watermelon- refreshing, interesting combo
- Mac- cheese lovers, get this! Explosion of the different cheese, galore! Don't forget to add their hot sauce to this! 
-Salad- made my ""i don't eat vegetables"" bf a vegetarian for a second there. 

Main:
-Short rib- omg the sauce. Yum. The carrot with the pepper on top balanced the heaviness but delicious meat and mash potato. 
-Chicken- good to share portion dipped with their hot sauce, not bad! 

Dessert: 
I was so stuffed but the food kept coming. Couldn't fully enjoy cuz I left no room but I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 


Every staff there were just as brilliant, clearing our table, switching to a new set for our next dish, filling our drinks and etc. Sarah came by a few times to make sure we were taken cared of. I just love her positive and bubbly personality. 

Jerry was amazing. He knows the menu and he knows our bellies. Take his recommendations and you can't go wrong. I over heard other servers conversations with their guests and they seem just as attentive, knowledgeable, and honest about which dish to go for and stay away from as the next. 

I'm excited for the one in LA to open up but boy do they have a tough act to beat with the three super S team- Steve, Scott and Sarah along with the wonderful Jerry!",l6y1_khn2V29gzu_srRlIQ,2,0,5,FGXwue-v2d-PracgGQBTNw

2952849,2015-03-30,8,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Executive summary: Average food with more than above average prices. A disappointing lunch for two was 85 dollars (no alcohol). 

Deviled eggs - very nice texture on the white of the egg but the yoke filling was rather bland. The egg itself was of high quality that's for sure. 

Smoked brisket sandwich - flavorless. The meat was rather fatty and the bun was somewhat soggy by the time it arrived to the table. 

Crunchy Yardbird sandwich - arrived cold and rubber-like texture. I had to send this one back and the replacement at least came out hot but the quality of the chicken just wasn't there. Dark meat with a nearly flavorless breading overly deep fried. 

You should be seeing a pattern by now; flavorless food. 

Arnold Palmer to drink...supposedly this is the Arnold Palmer of champions, with lemon infused ice cubes. Well, it was a decent Arnold Palmer, if you like tons of sugar added (I don't), but the lemon infused ice cubes were nowhere to be found. 

Smoked chocolate coffee cake with coffee ice cream. Unfortunately this was the highlight of the meal, and I had no intention going in to have dessert. The coffee cake came out as a full loaf hot and fresh from the oven but only a very small scoop of ice cream to accompany it. 

Service was pretty good. Received a visit from two managers and the chef...no doubt because of the send-back of their signature sandwich. 

All in all...a big let down especially when you consider the price paid for substandard food. I dare say (if I actually were to consume fast food) that KFC or a chain BBQ place such as Lucille's offer better taste and value.

In December I went to the Yardbird with high hopes of it being as awesome as I had been told. But that was not my experience, and afterwards I wrote my yelp review, because that is what I do. Trying to be as fair an honest as possible.

The owner of Yardbird read my previous review, and even though it was not bad, because it was not great he reached out personally to discuss my experience! I was surprised and impressed! He implored me to come in again, assuring me I had hit an off moment in his restaurant. So when a friend told me he was staying at the Venetian, and wanted to meet for dinner I thought this was a perfect opportunity to try again.

I am so glad I did! My experience was completely different! This time we sat in the dining room, last time I sat in the bar. The service was impeccable! We started with drinks, my freiend had a martini, and I had a lemonade (because I don't drink-don't judge! LOL) I still say one of the best lemonades ever!

For dinner I had the Shrimp & Grits, my friend had the fried chicken. It was delish!
And even though they have an AMAZING selection of appetizers, we were seduced with the idea of the cobbler for dessert! Which takes about 30 minutes, so order when you place your food order! LOL Yes, we were happy to order dessert first! LOL

Overall everything was fantastic, and the owner was correct. My mediocre experience was an anomaly, and I am so happy that he reached out and asked me to try again!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,3,0,5,cPO1lTeVydR4XC11rDWdrg

Made a quick reservation and our whole group was seated quickly. We ordered a various amount of dishes to share 

Biscuits are Insane and must have, actually came back 2 days later and took some to go back to my room.


Fried chicken was great, moist on inside and crunchy and full of flavor on outside. 


All the craft cocktails we ordered were delish 

Shrimp and grits as good as it gets 

So many things tasted off the charts nothing was bad except 



Desert the bacon infused cake was as dry, brittle and hard as if it was preserved since the Mayflower.

Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!

They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate. Literally a few minutes before that the waiter announced that they had that on the menu and then he had to come back and tell us that they ran out so he should've been a little more prepared.

I am a huge fan of seafood...raw or cooked...but it got shattered at Yardbird Southern Table & Bar with Chicken...fried chicken to be exact.

Yardbird is located on the casino floor of the Venetian. It is casual...in fact, I almost regret that I wasn't in one of my flannel shirts and an old pair of jeans...but I looked good. Our server Tracy, aka Hatch, was one of the best servers I've had--personable, playful, and professional with such an authentic character. He knew exactly what to recommend based on my preferences and I was impressed with how well he knew the menu.

My love and I shared Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles with Louisiana hot sauce and Maple syrup, Fried Green Tomato BLT, Shrimp 'N' Grits, and Velvet & Berries...oh, and I also enjoyed a Southern Revival cocktail.  It confused me so much how delicious the fried skin part of the Chicken was. The dish came with a half chicken which included both dark and white meat, but it really didn't matter to me as long as it was covered with fried skin. I could do without both the watermelon and waffle, though the watermelon was nicely seasoned and refreshing. Prior to dinner we stoped down the road and enjoyed a cocktail from master mixologist Juyoung at Delmonico. I certainly enjoyed this cocktail, but my tastebuds were pleasantly surprised by the Southern Revival--perfect to my likings.   

Throughout our dinner, service never fell short of being the best...from the hostess to our delightful server we were professionally taken care of...the floor was well maned with servers and front of house managers looking out for happy patrons.   

I am not typically a fan of anything-fried, but I am a huge fan of Yardbird's fried bird...we will be back soon.

We also overheard a table order tater tots and our ears perked up. We were so stuffed at that point but couldn't say no to taters. Asked the waiter for them and apparently it's an appetizer with beef cubes. This was equally scrumptious but as we thought we were done the gal who took the other table's order overheard us getting excited about tots that she brought us a separate plate of tots, now THAT'S customer service.

Make a reservation! For a Wednesday night in Vegas, it was packed even at 8pm. Reservations are easy to make.

Server was good and a new manager in training named Joe came by to check on me, which I appreciated. 

Ok here is what I had:

Angus burnt end - it was appetizer sized (4-5 burnt ends and 5-6 tater tots). This was ok but did not stand out. The burnt ends had decent flavour but the price and for what you got, I wouldn't order it again. 3.5 stars

Southern Revival cocktail - I like cocktails and this was good. You can taste the basil and the passion fruit as well as hints of the liquor. It was sweet but had a tart aspect to it which cut through the sweetness. Good 4 stars

Fried green tomato BLT - this was good. It had the right amount of spice in the deep fry coating around the green tomato, and the tomato was still hard inside after being deep fried. That texture mixed well with the rich and soft pork belly. All the other ingredients helped to bring the dish together. 4 stars

Lewellyn's Fried chicken - comes with 4 pieces of chicken and this is what I came here for. The coating on the chicken was great. Perfect amount of spices. The chicken was moist inside (due to the brining process I assumed). Great dish overall and well executed. 5 stars

Since we were staying at the Palazzo, and I love a good southern meal, we decided to try it out. Thankfully, it has been quiet in Vegas before Xmas so it was easy to walk-in and get a table. 

I read good things about the chicken so we decided to get that. Our waiter helpfully told us that the 1/2 chicken is the same amount of chicken as in the chicken & waffles. I was tempted by the other sides so we decided to trade carbs and go with chicken and sides of brussel sprouts (sweet and spicy), Mac and cheese, and corn bread. 

The chicken was delicious. Nicely crisp, good flavour. I just wish there was more chicken. One order for 2 people wasn't quite enough to satisfy my fried chicken cravings. 

The cornbread came out cold, so we had to send that back. The waiter was apologetic and it came back piping hot. We waited for the Mac & cheese and when it hadn't shown up after we were halfway through our meal, a manager was walking around the room checking on people and we asked about it. He quickly got us the Mac and cheese, apologized and told us he would take care of it. Wow, nice service and smoothly handled.

Sure, the fried chicken is delish. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich. But am I going to drive to the strip for a decent fried chicken sammy, no, it has to be extraordinary. I think that is the concept. To be above and beyond the average southern food. Add a twist such as the caviar on the deviled eggs. The service, the environment, and event the execution were all flawless. Between flavor and prices, I am just not that impressed. 
I have had southern style food in Arkansas at a diner, that tasted better. This is an overpriced Cracker Barrel with a few upgrades. Upgrades like $5 Mexican Cokes. When you pay .60 for something, you can safely up charge for it, but $5 for a small bottle, kiss my a%$. Wait, maybe that $5.00 coke included an ass kiss? Just maybe.

Yardbird is THAT place that will make you bear traffic, fight with taxis on Las Vegas blvd and walk through casinos for some chicken and waffles. 
I came for dinner on a Monday and was seated quickly(I made reservations on open table). I believe my waiter's name was Benjamin-awesome guy! Was thanked for stopping by, and making the trip to the strip to see what they are about. He explained the menu in about 35 seconds and left us to make our choices. 

We started with the fried green tomato BLT. Fried green tomatoes remind me of growing up in my home-state of Indiana. No one can really fry them like my grandparents..but this was an updated version topped with pimento cheese and a fat piece of bacon on top! Delicious!
Next was the main dish. I ordered chicken n watermelon waffles. The chicken was perfectly fried..like seriously...""perfect"" I'm still trying to figure out how you can fry chicken like that. lol.

On to dessert: the peach cobbler. Peach cobbler is that dish  in a southern family, gets passed down generations and you do NOT allow just anyone to make the peach cobbler at a family function.

Get their deviled eggs!  It's a little heavy on the pickle-y side, but overall super tasty!  Tastes like a regular deviled eggs, but flavors are amped up.  I've tried other deviled eggs where they try to be super creative and different by adding all these other ingredients only to disappoint and not knock my socks off.  Kudos to Yardbird on their awesome eggs!  

Tomatoes and ricotta, blistered tomatoes with sea salt, chili oil.. other stuff on top of ricotta.  This was Pinky's favorite, he loved the flavors of this dish.  As for me, I liked the semi cooked tomatoes with the hint of salt and sweetness, but the ricotta was not my cup of tea.  I just found the cheese to be way too grainy for my tastes.  Also, what chili oil?  I felt zero heat!  

Fried chicken, we opted to just get the half fried chicken without all the fixins.  The chicken was seasoned wonderfully, super moist with just enough salt in the meat.  However, we were unimpressed by the skin.  When you think of fried chicken, you imagine crispy skin coating juicy meat underneath.  The skin of our chicken was pretty soggy, as if they had kept it covered or left it sitting for a while after cooking.  Sorry, but Popeyes, Church's, and Korean fried chicken are better than Yardbird's chicken in our opinion, solely based on the lack of crispy skin.

3015099,2015-07-12,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"The one thing Las Vegas needs are fried chicken restaurants-specifically, elevated Southern cuisine, and Yardbird hits the mark on both accounts with flavorful, heart-y dishes. 

I returned after a few messages back and forth with the owner of the restaurant.  Not expecting anything except a better experience, we (my husband and I) booked a reservation for Saturday's supper hour (they call it ""supper"" on the menu listing and not ""dinner"", holding true to that southern charm).  I didn't say anything at the hostess counter except for my name and time slot.  The manager sat us at a table near the kitchen were I could peer around the corner to take a decent look at the setup.  Our server was fantastic and made sure we were never without the entire evening.

The kitchen is open to the public eye, showing off a pristine work area, bustling cooks, and chefs.  Even their coffee area located behind a swing door could be viewed when servers flipped by, showing a very neat and tight space.  Nothing stayed at the window for more than 60 seconds, if even that.  All the servers delivered plates with thumbs underneath the plate rather than on top of it.  No wrapper from the fork and knife were left on any tables, nor were water glasses even half empty.  Overall, the kitchen and service are impeccable.

The food started to come out, first course-our french fries with bacon salt and a buttermilk dipping sauce that had even more bacon on top.  I love that they recycle old menus as the paper on their side dish plates.  It adds to that home feel.  The fries were crispy, airy, and the bacon salt adds a unique flavor to the potatoes.  When dipped in the buttermilk and eaten with the bacon crumble and salt, it's truly heaven.  Their bacon salt is smoky and captures that bacon flavor so well.  It took less than 2 minutes to down this pan of fries.


Our food arrived no less than five minutes later.  This time, instead of watermelon and a waffle, I opted for the 2 things I love-biscuits and chicken.  The famous Lewellyn's fried chicken sat on the left, while the biscuits were cut in half, topped with pepper jelly, and a piece of boneless fried chicken right in there.  It's served with housemade pickles and onions.  Trust me-adding both of those into this biscuit makes this sandwich amazing.  The contrast of sweet and spicy jelly, the salty, chicken goodness, then the bite of pickles and pickled onions is absolute heaven.  It's incredibly simple, incredibly easy you may think, but those biscuits are on another level.  The chicken here takes a brine swim for a few days-and not in buttermilk.  They're then coated and pressure fried to perfection.  The chicken is very juicy, extremely tender, flavorful, and that coating packs a punch.  I recall saying I would not pay the $26 for their chicken.  I take it back.  I'm definitely going back for more.  Plates emptied, we had to order dessert, and instead of the oreos we ate last time, we opted for the bacon butterscotch cake with pecan filling, bourbon ice cream, and butterscotch sauce.


Let me start by saying that the cake is Vegas-sized, and every table around us noticed this giant being brought to the table.  Heads turned-that's how big this mammoth mountain of cake goodness is.  I dove right in, letting each layer fall from the tip, gathering it all up with butterscotch sauce and a dollop of bourbon ice cream.  It's served cold with this crazy icing and pecan filling that isn't too sweet, then that salty, sweet, butterscotch goodness mixed with the bourbon ice cream is one of the perfect sweet bites I had in a long time.  Don't worry-the cake isn't filled with bits of bacon, so don't be afraid of this.  Love it.  Love it so much to set a calendar reminder to eat one every Saturday morning at brunch.

I said back in March ""the food was good but I am still searching for my Perfect Fried Chicken in Las Vegas"".  After a redo meal at Yardbird, I have to say that this place is the restaurant for Southern cuisine and has one of the best fried chicken dishes in Vegas.  It's not just the food that impresses-it's the Southern hospitality.  Yardbird is more than just a restaurant-it's an experience.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,5,vcEXcYA3cHwvWoEO_0E6eQ

Normally in a brisket sandwich the bread is just too much, but with a biscuit the ratio was perfect. The brisket was fatty, soft, and very flavorful. Eat those immediately as it gets cold fast.

The chicken was good, however I was expecting much much better. If I had to choose Popeyes, I would. Admiringly this might be healthier since it might be fried less, but the taste wasn't special.

The Mac and cheese was just very standard. Wouldn't get it again and idk why others suggest it.

3029657,2015-01-24,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Went for brunch on a Sunday about 11am. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated.

The ambiance is LOUD.  

My wife had to tend to our 15 month old in the restroom. Since we had never been here before, I wished our server had waited to go into her ""spiel"" about the place. She considered for a moment to wait but then changed her mind and went into it anyway. Seemed rushed even though the place was at 25% occupancy.

We were told that whatever we order will come out in the time that it takes to prep, so nothing will come out at the same time. I thought it strange that the kitchen would operate that way but new concept, new rules.

We ordered a couple of bloody marys and an old fashioned. Bloody's were ok. 
Tastes like they put pickle juice in the mix, meh not a fan. The old fashioned was good, but 2oz of liquid for a $14 price tag? It was gone in 3 sips. 

My son got a half glass of milk for $4.50

We ordered the skillet cornbread on the brunch menu that is prepared with bacon and jalapenos. MMMM! nope......

What we got was a lemon poppy seed cornbread that was like eating a muffin. 

Not what I was expecting. A manager did visit later to explain that on brunch they do things a little different than the regular menu but we wondered why the brunch menu had a bacon jalapeno cornbread on it if they were offering lemon poppy seed? 

My wife was having the BLT, my mom the offered omelet, and I was sharing a wedge salad, fried chicken with a side of mac n cheese and a side of bacon.  

The BLT and my side salad came first. The BLT was good. Pimento cheese rich, creamy. She liked it. My salad was good. I liked the deep fried bacon and dressing.

I ordered a Southern peach cocktail. This took some time to get. When I got it it looked watered down like it sat for a bit or was prebatched. The flavor was ok, but could barely taste the whiskey. I passed it on to my wife and got the blackberry lemonade. This was also ok, and I could taste the bourbon so it was worth finishing. 

Fried chicken, bacon, and omelet was next.

Half of bird, you get 4 pieces. The chicken was tender. You can tell they marinade it for 27 hours. It was lukewarm though, so I did not enjoy it as much as I wanted the $26 price tag to justify. I've had better (and hotter) from (and don't hate me) certain supermarkets.

My moms $16 dollar 2 egg omelet was also lukewarm. We wondered what held
up the order that both dishes would be (cold) lukewarm. We were hungry so we ate. I finished all my chicken by the time the mac n cheese arrived ( late & yet again, lukewarm.) You get about an 8oz scoop for $10. It was good, but still I found myself wishing it was (hotter) better.  

We declined on desert and I balked at the check total of $167.00 

It's not about the $$$$, I've been to Jose Andre's Bazaar Meats and was skipping out of there paying well over $400 for 2 people. It was THAT good. 

This experience felt like, I had just been had, if you get my meaning. It's like paying way more for front row seats when you could have gotten closer to the stage if you sat on the side that included a close up video screen to boot. 


We did find out at the very end of our experience that Yardbird had been open for just over a week. After opening 7 corporate restaurants myself, suddenly it had explained a lot. I wished then I had waited before going, but I was misled by all the daily ads on Facebook and certain Yelp reviews. The menu sounded like a slam dunk to me so I did little research. 

It seems like there are a lot of people giving out 5 star ratings like its free for this new concept. (One of the disadvantages of Yelp) I'm seeing a trend in them like they were written by friends or family of the company. Based on my experience, I find it hard to believe they could be legitimate this soon. 

Even if I loved the place, there are very, very few restaurants that I would rate 5 star. It gives legitimacy to the ones that really deserve it.  

Based on the price/portion/menu selection/value factor I don't think I would return to Yardbird as I could get the same food almost anywhere at a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the distance to walk from my car. Another strip venue that boasts higher prices with such little value.",lhPuskGXTRSjCwKOOOYeoA,4,0,2,Bltw15bMXcB9h-7snlziTg

Dinner began with a killer watermelon cocktail with whiskey.  I should of only had one; however, chose to have 3, maybe 4?  We then split the bone marrow appetizer.  It was an interesting presentation, very Fred Flintstonesque.  It may have been a tad too rich for me but was tasty.  They also lacked marrow spoons to facilitate eating the meat.

I then had the best iceberg wedge salad of my life.  The dressing was yogurt based and the bacon was cut into cubes fried and served hot.  It was a massive portion clearly enough for 2.  It was yummy.

Entrée was shrimp with grits.  It was exceptional once again and something I will eat again.

Having visited Atlanta over the summer, we were well aware of the type of meal and portion sizes to expect from a James Beard nominated Southern food restaurant.

Restaurant appears small as you stand at the hostess station, but as you walk to the rear of the restaurant, the place is huge!!! Dimly lit, in a good and bad way. Good cause it's got a cool and romantic vibe to it. Bad cause it's nearly impossible to read the menu when you can barely see. 

Fried Green tomato BLT's:

Wow, such a decadent and well established dish. Green tomatoes were fresh, fried to perfection and packed an excellent crunch with a zip of tang.
Pimento cheese spread, obviously made in house, was the star. Creamy, almost crab salad ish texture and wonderful flavors. 
Crisp pork belly was a bit rough around the edges, literally. I suspect that would be standard for a pig belly, but it was a bit tough to chew on. 

Over all 5/5

Fried chicken biscuits:

What, what?? Freshly made Southern biscuits in Vegas? Yeah, they done did it now!!!

Delicious doughy biscuits with giant slabs of perfectly fried, delicious chicken inside. We were way over our ski's cause we ordered this thinking petite Vegas portions, but the bird didn't fly that way at all!!!

Swine Burger:

Holy sheep bleep!!! Fresh ground blend of short rib and swine n stuff. Served up with more pork belly and a buttery bun and oh my oh my oh my!! Fantabulous burger that was easily enough for two to split, but my lovely wife did her darndest to complete the challenge. She fell short and failed, but please, don't tell anyone bout it.

Short Rib:

This is an item that I have a really difficult time not ordering when it's on any menu. Plenty of Yelpers raved about this dish, so of course, I ordered it. 

Pretty darn delicious BUT.... Nobody is perfect, right? It could probably be served off the bone and with the costal cartilage removed. I know, I know. It's easy to toss shade when you've never cooked in a kitchen, but BUT, I've made this dish a dozen times and prefer to serve the deliciousness and not that nastiness. Just sayin' though.

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and cool dining experience. As for meself, I think the next time I make it to Vegas, I will stick to a giant, bloody steak cause for some odd reason, it's easier to stay awake after that meal than it was this meal.",ENtSjbekFHjltp2TFkstHg,1,1,4,igT-0GPJrYswedZacPhAZQ

We of course had to get the Preacher's ham biscuits which were a perfect blend of soft buttermilk biscuits, savory ham, and a sharp note with the Vermont Cheddar cheese. We also got the Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles again and this time, it was simply perfect. The chicken was bursting with juice and flavor and somehow the pressure cooking process just amplified the flavor. The skin also had a nice crisp and wasn't too overpowering but paired with the tender chicken perfectly. The waffle is glorious! Just add a little bourbon maple syrup and you won't want to eat chicken and waffles anywhere else.  The fried okra is a must-get side pairing, and the okra is plump and bursting with flavor without any sliminess. Finish that all off with the peach cobbler and you will have the meal of a lifetime. The peach cobbler looks like it could feed a county fair as the peaches with tender and sweet with a great crisp from the topping and a smooth finish when paired with the french vanilla ice cream!

The entrees were good but not our favorite items. 
We also ordered a couple of drinks. The Blueberry Bourbon Lemonade was great. It was sweet but had a smokey flavor to it. My bf ordered the Watermelon Cocktail drink, I forgot the full name but it's on their Cocktail drink menu. It was also good but a drink to sip on because it was on the stronger side. Luis also helped decide on a dessert menu. We got the fried Oreos and it was also pretty good.

The BLT want for me but the deviled eggs, ai could have eaten a dozen all by myself! The only thing stopping me from licking the plate was the other patrons in the restaurant! Next was the bone marrow, once again I wanted to pull a Fred flu stone and pick that baby up and suck it clean.. Although known for the fried chicken, it lacked the wow factor. It was seasoned well and moist, but I've had better. Forgot to mention it was my daughters bday so of course we needed dessert! We ordered the peach cobbler to share thinking with all the food we've already had, a few bites of cobbler wouldn't be bad. Well out came the waiter with a behemoth size cobbler!! And the flavor!!

Chicken on a biscuit was so good. Makes you want to slap your momma...(that's a saying, I don't endorse violence).

My husband's cocktail was some bourbon with basil and infused with bacon mixture. It was well balanced and I even drank a few sips.

My salad was grilled and I added pulled chicken: mistake. Salad good, a little warm with a light but tasty ceasar-like dressing. The pulled chicken tasted just like beef jerky. I made my husband try it to make sure I wasn't crazy. He agreed. It was cold, beef jerky flavored chicken. It wasn't very appetizing so I ate the salad and left most of the chicken. Also, I stole from of his food. 

The mac & cheese was 3/5. It wasn't worth the calories or the $10 for a side. 

We saw a few families. It's pretty casual but in an elegant setting.

It had 3 cheeses a yellow cheddar a white cheddar and a blue cheese with two types of prosciutto and a meat spread.  The blue cheese was a little to serious for me (hints of horse hoof).  Other than that our platter was wonderful.  Our waitress (Lazetta) was very friendly and helpful. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and she was extremely happy.  I tried a bite of the waffle with the bourbon sauce and it was awesome.  I ordered the house chicken with a side of grits. I have never had a better tasting fried chicken in my life.

We started off with some classic biscuits.
Biscuits- They were so soft and fluffy. The honey butter and peppery tasting fruit jam were delicious. 

Low and Slow Smoked Chicken Salad- My mind was blown. The flavors and texture were so so good!! I am not a salad person, so I am very thankful that my friend decided to order this.
The chicken is soft and mixed with corn and a creamy buttermilk dressing that had a citrusy flavor. This is placed on top of a slightly sweet fried cornbread. There was some chicken and crunchy cornbread in every bite. I wish that dish would have lasted forever!! 

Fried Green Tomato BLT- Even though there were only 3 small pieces, they were packed with flavor. The fried green tomato was topped with some hummus made from peppers and pork belly. This is an interesting pairing of flavors, but they work well together. The pork belly melted in your mouth. I wish they gave more of the pork belly!

Bacon Hash- The hash was made of Yukon potatoes, yams, and pork belly. It was good, but was my least favorite appetizer item. I would not get this again.

Dulce de Leche Strawberry Waffle- The waffle sounded delicious so we got it. But, it was just a waffle topped with some cut strawberries and a dollop of cream. It was a decent waffle. This was definitely not worth the $15 price tag. 

If in Vegas again, I am making sure to revisit. The overall food, attentive service, and ambiance make this an awesome dining spot. The next time I visit, I am going to order 2 Low and Slow Smoked chicken salads and eat them myself.",iuqXV-puBMppS0DLwzfEXg,0,0,5,8Lb1wjjnk5sBbdzOqZUU5A

Unfortunately, we were sorely disappointed - when an iceberg wedge salad and biscuits are the most memorable part of a meal at a southern restaurant something is wrong. 

Food:

Burnt ends: 1/5; they weren't even smoked, they weren't burnt ends, and relied on overly sweet bbq sauce to compensate for the lack of smoke, etc. we eat a lot of bbq and I lived in the south and was sad. 

Deviled eggs: 2/5; meh - the waitress said they were amazing and they really weren't. Little bit of salmon roe and dill but nothing special.

Iceberg wedge salad: 3.5/5 - not the best salad I have ever had but in comparison to the other food, it was light years ahead.

Biscuits: 4/5 - flakey, warm, and came with honey butter and jam - enough said

Chicken and waffles and watermelon: 1/5 - waffles were soggy and not super flavorful, fried chicken was meh at best - couldn't even tell it had been bribed for 27 hours and it lacked seasoning (Ad Hoc fried chicken was so much better), and the watermelon didn't even taste like anything had been done to it. 

Brussel sprouts: 1/5 - way too oily and just unappealing. I love Brussel sprouts usually and this is the first time I have left almost the entire bowl untouched. 

The service was mixed; our first waitress forgot about us, we never got water and eventually had to ask a bus boy for water.

First meal during this past Vegas trip. We dropped by for dinner on Wednesday, July 8th around 8:30pm. No reservation and a party of 5. We were seated right away.

Drinks:
*Watermelon sling: High west silver oak whiskey, fresh pressed watermelon juice & fresh lemon with aperol ($14)
*Southern revival: sweet and sour featuring wild turkey 81, passion fruit, basil ($14)
*Yardbird old fashioned: bacon-infused buffalo trace bourbon, angostura bitters, orange bitters, maple syrup ($15)
*Albert's collins: absolut, Avion reposado and spring 44 old tom gin ($15)
*Df evocation ($7)

After drinking all day, I could only stomach a cocktail. My choice of the Watermelon sling was perfect. Light and easy to drink. I nursed this the whole dinner.

Food:
*Deviled eggs: fresh chive, smoked trout roe 'redneck caviar' ($11)
*Bbq pork belly: 4oz house pork belly, sherry apple glaze, sliced pickle salad ($14)
*Iceberg wedge: crisp iceberg lettuce, fresh corn, tomatoes, house-smoked bacon, avocado, gaba goo dressing ($14)
*St Louis style pork ribs: tender slow-cooked, house bbq sauce ($32)
*Shrimp n' grits: Florida shrimp, crisp Virginia ham, Nora mill granary grits ($28)
*Chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles: yardbird's signature 'old school fried chicken', honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, bourbon maple syrup ($36 +$8 one thigh)
*Skillet cornbread: cheddar, bacon, jalapeno, maple butter ($9)
*Macaroni & cheese: torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust ($10)

My favorite dish was the mac and cheese. Just the perfect amount of creaminess and crustiness. I finished off the dish since I liked it so much. Second fav was the shrimp and grits. The grits were kind of chunky with I enjoyed. The shrimp tender and flavorful. Of course I had to get a salad. Not the best wedge salad I've had. Felt like the corn made it too busy, but it added the refreshing element I needed when eating all the heavy food.

The found the mains of ribs and chicken okay. They were a little dry in my opinion. But with the chicken, I'm normally a thigh fan and ended up with a breast, so that may have been the reason. I did like the flavor of the breading though. That's what I get for eating slowly and grabbing a piece of chicken last! The deviled eggs were creamy and huge, but I felt the addition of roe just added an unnecessary fishiness. And the pork belly was waaay too tough and sweet.

Dessert
*'Crunch 'n munch' bread pudding, popcorn ice cream, caramel popcorn, pretzel ($10)

I only took a bit of this since we ordered dessert. I'm not a huge chocolate fan or bread pudding fan, so I didn't care for this at all.

This was probably a case of ordering too much of the wrong dishes. I probably would have enjoyed the bone marrow versus some of the other apps we got. But I believe the fried chicken was good. It was just a shame that I got the wrong kind of piece. But the mac and cheese redeemed it all for me. 3.5 rounded up to 4 stars!",lLfcbYGTeVxQN5Ig0ompJg,9,8,4,NLM5LVRYQTsVtabOIefoyQ

The chicken tasted all right but was salty from the brine. The cornbread, while not very warm, was tasty but crumbly. The lettuce badly needed seasoning, and to be hotter. (Notice the theme here? Cold food.)

We made a reservation for 7 people on a Friday night 830pm. Did not get seated right away so we got to explore the Venetian a bit. They will call you when the table is ready so that is convenient. There is high table, bar, and couch seating. Its a dark rustic looking place. Vegas' version of ""The South.""

2x Fried Chicken ala carte 4/5 
2x Fried Chicken and waffles 4/5
They are known for their 27 hr brine fried chicken. Each plate is half a chicken with 2 dark and 2 white meat portions. Unfortunately, it was probably the least favorite/least flavor dish for our group. And for $36 it certainly isnt very good value for how little it tastes. I'd be ok with $25, but I've had better chicken and waffles for $20. Maybe the cost is the burbon maple syrup or the 3 watermelon cubes that are there. At least both the dark meat and white meat are super juicy, but that is to be expected if it was brined. The fried skin just wasn't spectacular. The waffles weren't anything super special. If anything, the burbon maple syrup did taste somewhat like burbon. My friends were denouncing my Yelp Elite skills of picking places. Fortunately, the other food items we picked were better.

1x Roasted Brussel sprouts 5/5 These were very well done.
1x Shrimp and grits 4/5 Very tasty
1x St. Louis Ribs 5/5 Probably the favorite meat dish. The bbq sauce was pretty good.

Split was $30/person with tax and tip included so not too bad.

Had a $200 certification so everyone in my party ordered anything they wanted off the menu.

3167552,2015-01-05,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"First off, we got 5 star service at this place.  This could've had something to do with our earlier arrival time (we sat down for brunch at around 10:30 am) and the amount of staff they had on hand, but our main server was great.  He was very attentive and inquisitive, and seemed very committed to delivering a quality experience.  The bussers also appeared in a snap to pick up discarded napkin rings as soon as they hit the table and clear plates as soon as the last bite had been consumed.

The atmosphere is also great.  Kind of a early 20th century southern feel, and they project old photos of musicians on the wall to keep your eyes occupied.  

The food is tasty, although very heavy.  I started off with a bourbon blackberry lemonade.  We also got the deviled eggs, kale salad, mac and cheese, and the savory cheddar waffle.  It was all very tasty, though the flavors were so heavy and rich I felt pretty sluggish for the remainder of the afternoon.  Definitely a strong bourbon theme running through their food, so if you hate bourbon be wary.  

They also have a very extensive drinks list.  In addition to the very interesting mixed drink options, they have a solid wine list and an excellent 2 page beer list.  They feature many local beers on draft, which is tough to find on the strip.  We ended up trying a flight of their local Nevada pours.

So with 5 star service, 5 star atmosphere, 5 star drink list and 4 star food (yummy but just a tad heavy for me), I'd give this an overall 5 star experience.",2C8pij4QASB2oHS9gvaUEA,2,1,5,O8_Pm5rj0luZwSHszr6nGw
3167873,2015-07-08,4,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"When Yardbird opened up earlier this year, I was dying to get in there and eat. For whatever reason, it took a few months us to finally go, but it was my birthday, and as good of as a reason as ever. We just recently went again for the second time for a friends birthday, and Yardbird has definitely solidified itself as one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.

A quick tip for those coming in for the first time. I think it's a lot easier to come into the The Palazzo parking garage off Spring Mountain. When you park, there's elevators that take you right up into the casino, then a short walk through the area with the big fountain, and Yardbird is right there. For me, that garage seems a lot easier to access, and it's almost never full either.

Anyhow, the restaurant itself is pretty cool. A bit smaller than you would expect, but we recently found out they have a little private dining area as well. It, like the rest of the restaurant has a lot of homey, classic southern style decor. Lots of wood, old pictures, and the private room has a wall full of liquors and a view of the wine cellar. They also have a nice section of the wall with a hidden TV that rotates pictures of musicians. If you have a large party to eat with here, definitely ask if that room is available. It makes for an even more enjoyable experience.

Now, the menu at Yardbird is pretty stout. It might seem small at first glance, especially since only one page is dedicated to food...but there's a lot of options, and the portions are huge. Their food is meant to be shared, so order up and have at it family style. 

So far, we've only been for brunch, but I think we've had just about everything on that menu besides the salads. Out of the 5 starter small plates, the only thing we haven't tried is the pork, but everything else is spectacular. Stand outs for me are the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Mama's Chicken Biscuits. Both on the pricey side at $14, but worth every cent. And that's not to take away from the Deviled Egg's or Chicken Liver Toast either, which are equally impressive, and even quite a bit cheaper.

Moving on to the main dishes, you can't not mention the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Yes, it's $36...but if you're idea of eating good involves chain restaurants and fast food, you shouldn't be here anyway. Not to mention, it easily serves 3 or 4 people, maybe more depending on what else you order. The chicken is absolutely amazing. Crispy, crunchy, but still tender and juicy. Their cheddar cheese waffles are unbelievable, and they serve them with this green tomato pepper jam stuff that ties everything in for a taste bud party. And I'm not even a watermelon fan...at all...but I enjoy their spiced watermelon served alongside it as well. 

The Shrimp n' Grits is another stand out for main dishes. A large bowl of creamy grits, topped with large, juicy shrimp, and little crispy bits of ham make for an excellent breakfast. It's another higher cost plate at $28, but even it can be shared with at least 2 people no problem.

A lot of there smaller items off their ""Odds and Ends"" menu are great too. First time visits, I'd suggest ordering the Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. And when you're done with all that, look right over to the right for dessert items. Since I've never had something there I didn't like, I'd say go for it all. The Mini Bacon Doughnuts, Chess Pie, Hickory Smoked Chocolate Coffee Cake and Cinnamon Apple Hand Pies are all excellent choices. 

My one and only biggest gripe with Yardbird is not so much the service itself, as it's almost always excellent, but both times we've been here, they have forgotten dishes. Our first time here, they completely left out an order of Deviled Eggs. This past visit they forgot to bring out an order of Shrimp n' Grits, so one of our party had to exit the room and go ask for it. Then when it came time to order dessert, they completely forgot an order of the bread budding. Luckily we were all pretty much at breaking point, but it's irritating to say the least. Especially when this place specializes on family style eating and having guests order multiple plates. To be honest, I'm not even 100% sure if we paid for the missing items on either visit either. 

When all is said and done though, Yardbird is seriously one of the most enjoyable and memorable places to eat. It's not crazy expensive for what you get, and if you come with a group of people, the experience is even that much better, and your bill will be cheaper to split. On both occasions we've spent close to $300, but that's for big parties of 8 or more, and with tip. There's not many places you can spend about $30-$40 per person while getting that much food and being able to sample that many items.

If you like southern food, or even if you don't - I think you definitely need to give this place a try.  Well worth it (a trillion times over).

First of all, they have a lot of bourbon-based cocktails.  I get it - a southern thing.  However, I don't like bourbon.  They offered to sub the bourbon for vodka, and I was like SWEET I love you already.

For our appetizer, we chose the Fried Green Tomato BLT which was a layered tomato, pork belly, pimento cheese, tomato jam thing.  Soooo freaking good!  The pimento cheese is where it's at.  GAH!

For entrees, I had the shrimp n grits which was probably one of my top shrimp n grits meals ever.  Hubby had the blue plate special, which was chicken, watermelon and a biscuit.  He is an expert in fried chicken, and because he said it was absolutely delicious, you will love it too.

Part of me regrets saving the best for last and going to Yardbird for our last meal while in town. I made a reservation a month prior and added people to the reservation twice. The staff at Yardbird was extremely accommodating and helpful. I'm glad we made a reservation because it was over an hour wait to get in Yardbird on a Sunday at 12pm. 

Not only did we have the best food of our Vegas trip at Yardbird but we had the best service too. Our waitress, Carolina made our experience five stars. She recommended cocktails, appetizers and entrees. She took the time to answer everyone's questions and requests. We were a big group and she separated checks without the slightest problem (apparently it's a problem every where else in Vegas).

Now for the food.. oh em gee. We ordered the fried green tomatoes topped with thick bacon and it was a culinary experience. The green tomatoes were crisp and the bacon was perfectly cooked. We also shared the chicken and waffles and the Mac and cheese. The chicken and waffles was amazing. I have never had such juicy, moist fried chicken. The syrup was delicious and the cheddar cheese waffle complimented the chicken perfectly. The Mac and Cheese was also killer. I loved the crispiness of the breadcrumbs on top, mixed with the creaminess of the cheese. 

Another highlight of our experience was the baller cocktails. We ordered the Revival, an Old Fashioned and a Bloody Mary. All were equally great in different ways. The Bloody Mary had a nice thin mix to it that tasted fresh and light. The Revival is the perfect brunch drink for a bourbon lover. It was light and had a fresh citrus hint, making the bourbon not as heavy as a normal bourbon cocktail. The old fashioned was also delicious.

Like I said, I'm sad we saved Yardbird for last because I would have gone there everyday. I will definitely be back to this location or the one in Miami in the near future.",xWEKLTw0NWgHS67oCyVp8g,1,0,5,oHTgTDJ4ZAGpp5ZcM2pbiw

The Mac n cheese was decent, you can expect it to be pretty chunky with thick cheese compared to more of the creamier mac n cheeses.  The Fried Green tomato BLT appetizer is one of their most popular dishes! It is a fried green tomato topped with smoked pork belly and cheese :) The tastes were absolute perfect, and I've never tasted anything like it before! The fries were perfectly good as well, it came with a good side dip too.
For entrees, I had the Grilled chicken BLT while others at my table ordered the fried chicken. The grilled chicken BLT was unexpectedly tasty-it was grilled chicken, with pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes between two thick pieces of texas toast.  The texas toast gave it great flavor, the crust was crunchy while the inside was very buttery and soft :) The fried chicken plate was pretty good too, but the chicken itself was small.  The biscuits were warm and yum too :)
Overall a very good lunch place! The flavors were amazing and all the dishes were very solid! I left full and happy :)",PCxFX14f5rME2_uEkrfVfw,1,1,5,T2ObBDFNteifCGYovhgp7A

Service was top notch starting with a big smile by the greeter followed by the hostess who seated us immediately for our 6:45pm reservation (despite it being CES), to our server Christine who provided just the right enough of personal attention without being intrusive (she also provided great recommendations) and finally the manager who stopped by to say hi and ask how our meal was going. We were all apprehensive of coming because none of us are huge fried chicken fans. But it looked too good to pass up. And sure enough we ordered it and could not have been happier!! Sooooo delish! My son was more in the mood for a Hamburger and it was amazingly unique in that is a combination of brisket and short rib meat!' I'm ordering that the next time!

We were staying at the Venetian and saw Yardbird on their restaurant row and made a mental note to try it.  It always seemed packed when we walked by so I looked them up on open table and snagged a reservation.  Glad I did, because when we went if you didn't have a reservation you basically only the option to sit at the bar.  

We sat in the back and ordered the fried chicken, classic buttermilk biscuits and the house fries (bacon salt & cheese).  Plus a couple bourbons.  It all came out at once and was out of this world.  Seriously, the right balance of crispy, salty goodness.  Nothing was greasy, it was just well cooked and perfectly seasoned.  

I wish we had one in Denver!!! Seriously the best fried chicken I have had in a long time.  Service was outstanding and it had a very down home laid back vibe.

3213852,2018-01-06,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I was craving southern food and stumbled upon this place. I have very mixed feelings about the dishes. I thought the Fried Green Tomato BLT was excellent. The pork belly was succulent and the dish was perfectly seasoned. The fried green tomatoes were crispy and well cooked. I also thought the Classic Buttermilk Biscuits were delicious and light. Service was also great and quick and the decor was cool and interesting. 

My only complaint was the fried chicken, which was their signature dish. We ordered the Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles, which came highly recommended. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the dish, but it was not the best fried chicken I had. I thought the chicken was slightly too large, so there wasn't enough coating. I also thought that the ""chilled spiced watermelon"" didn't taste chilled or spiced. It tasted more brined, in which case I'd much rather have pickled watermelon rind rather than the flesh. The waffles were decent, but again nothing to write home about.",HCBoPnFQLLcQYx50XodZ5g,0,0,4,jvh5fqA3o5ptLzMlkkiV3w

Jim G. and I posted up at the bar for some Saturday afternoon brunch.  Our server, Mallory, came over to get a drink order. Jim G. was famished so he also started us with some Deviled Eggs right away.

The Deviled Eggs came out and were tasty.  The portion, while only being 4 eggs, is huge, since the 'deviled' part is piled might high!  It took close to 20 minutes to get Mallory's attention so that we could order our actual food. Sitting at the bar, we would've expected it to be much easier to get someone.  Sadly, she was at the other end of the bar talking with another bartender or someone.  

When we did order, we got the Fried Chicken, Watermelon, and Waffles.  Huge portion!  We shared half a friend chicken!  The chicken was super good. It was very moist and the meat had great flavor.  I do believe the oil could have been a tiny bit hotter, so that it'd be a bit less greasy, but it was still good.  The spiced watermelon was awesome!  The waffles, however, were a bit of a letdown.  Seemingly lacking in real flavor and not all that crisp.  They made me want the waffles at Bouchon!

We had lots of other time basically getting ignored by Mallory and had to flag down someone else for more drinks and, eventually, our check. The getting ignored at the bar was especially detrimental to our ability to enjoy our time there.  Mallory, another bartender, and what looked like a manager spent about 15 minutes seemingly deciding where to put bourbon bottles on display.  Perhaps it's better in the main dining room, but my experience is usually that sitting at the bar is the way to go.  

If I ate more carbs, I might be more willing to go back to try them again.  As it is, I'm not so sure.",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,7,3,3,hjiR7rF41XKlig1wkgYKqg

Maddie had the shrimp and grits which was straight out of Savannah Georgia in flavor and size. Needless to say we have our dinner already packaged up for us because the portions were large.

The lounge area was doing a brisk business and many tables in the dining rooms were occupied. We were seated in an area that consists of a row of 2 person tables. One side are soft bench style seats and opposite are single chairs.
These tables are close together and results in hearing the next tables conversation. This was our situation in that next to us were 2 women and 1 man. The man was monopolizing the conversation and overly loud. Must have been trying to impress.??
Service was spot on and friendly. Water glasses were promptly refilled and our server walked us through the entire menu.  
We shared an order of chicken, (basically a half  a chicken) since it was described as enough for 2 people. Our side was the roasted fingerling potatoes. Food is delivered as it is ready and not held until all items are done. The chicken came out first followed a few minutes later by the potatoes. A small container of tangy dipping sauce is served on the side. Overall wait time for the food was short.

The chicken was hot and juicy with a nice crunchy skin. The sauce was a perfect complement if you like it a little spicy. The fingerling potatoes were excellent and the quantity was more than we could consume as the chicken was the first priority.

The decor is interesting with many pictures of celebrities and various mason jars displayed around the restaurant. The specialty drinks are also served in mason jars.

A major improvement would to spread out the tables and tone down the hard surfaces to make it conversation friendly. This change would earn another star from me.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,1,2,3,jMj7E7wsofs6FPzTsl0-3Q

For an entree we each got the chicken, watermelon and waffles minus the watermelon due to an allergy. The chicken was moist and perfect and dipping it in the hot sauce took it over the top. The waffles were cooked to perfection and the bourbon syrup on top was fantastic. On the side, we ordered Mac and cheese and cheese grits. I'm not a fan of grits in general, so I basically skipped out on these with only one or two small bites. The Mac and cheese was amazing.

For dessert, we split the chocolate Nutella cake. After one bite I was immediately regretting not getting the peach cobbler. The cake was dry and pretty forgettable. Not the best way to end an otherwise great meal.",-hYYjAXSAa657rY0ANtTGQ,0,0,5,txMVUFtCX4Hl0A3W7zz7Hg

As we walked in, hostess didn't even greet us. She just said we are setting up your table and it'll be ready soon. She sat us in a very small table and their were three of us. No big deal...as we were excited to try the place out. Server came and never introduced herself or really welcome us. Just straight asked if we been there before. After looking at the menu I still couldn't decide so we ordered 2 appetizers ( BLT and pork croquet). After a few bites, server came back and asked ""can I get you anything else?"" In a ..(are you going to spend more money or what) tone and facial expression. I said yes we are ready and please take the lady's order first. She took her order and was about to leave without taking or asking if I wanted something. I had to stop her so I can get my order in. 
So after 10 seconds...10 seconds!!! One of our entrees comes(chicken and waffles) I told the food runner that we just ordered it and can't be possibly done but she tried imposing it to us. I kept explaining that we just ordered it so I picked up the plate and told her take it back because she just dropped the aps no more than 2 mins ago. After finishing our aps, entrees came (chicken and waffles, chicken and biscuits, and shortrib and grits) dropped by a different runner and literally slamming the plates down our table. At this point, we were so irritated but hoped the food will make up for the terrible service we received thus far. I'm disappointed to say that the food didn't do it either. Biscuits, shortrib and grits were all dry. The chicken is good tho..crispy and juicy. Our server didn't check on us maybe after halfway thru our dinner and I really needed some ranch n bbq sauce and our waters refilled. A friendly busser checked on us and asked if she can box the rest. Then after another long wait our server comes, never offers dessert and asked if we were done..I guess so. We found out her name from the bill ( Nycole = terrible service ). Total came out to $150. Paid $200. Nycole dropped off the changed without an actual tendered receipt so we asked for one and even on that she gave us a hard time and gave us excuses how she can't do it. Lol sure Hun, I'm not stupid. I was going to speak to the manager as we were walking out but lady said don't worry about it and it's not worth it. 
I just hate getting terrible service, subpar food for premium prices. I don't mind paying premium as long as food and service backs it up. Not to mention DB brasserie next door is FINE DINING with more reasonable pricing than yardbird.",qWMUWDjI1wXWnmzlQc2BuA,8,3,1,a3GIv0uqwTTD-pBHDoQIHw

3289484,2018-04-05,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird is far overrated, and probably by guests who don't know Southern cooking.  We are from the South, grew up with collards and fried chicken, so we know a thing or 2 about real Southern food, and how it should be prepared.  Yardbird is not authentic.

Their mac n cheese is could easily be a Kraft mix with breadcrumbs added on top.  The buttermilk biscuits are heavy, not light textured, and are far too chewy.  The shrimp and grits are incredibly bland, and not worth buying.  The collards were not properly seasoned, and left the impression they are California influenced, not Carolinas (or other Southern state) influenced as they should be.  Allegedly, the Preacher's Ham is from Virginia, but if so, they would be better off serving Smithfield's mass produced ham.  It was not particularly flavorful. In the South, we would never serve a ham biscuit with cheese, much less using any cheese from Vermont.  Carolina Q sandwiches are pork, not tuna. Tuna? Give us a break.

Don't get me wrong, the food is OK, not great, and the best analogy would be US Mexican restaurants don't serve authentic Mexican food in order to attract as many customers as possible.  

Our server was attentive, but did not know the basics about true Southern food. 

Will I go back?  No, not even it they converted to service off a food truck, nor would I attend a conference party held at Yardbird.",mTTQt5C3uF03rh1jl1H4Cg,0,0,2,s3kniffUas_RHvkE1P_GAw

Boyfriend made reservations last minute for dinner.
We arrived the restaurant 10 minutes earlier and was able to be seated.
The ambiance is dim and nice.

We ordered:
-biscuits: The biscuits were decent. I think i could have enjoyed dinner without these. The waffles that came with the chicken were plenty of carbs. 
Also the biscuits were plain Jane. Nothing out of the ordinary.

-Chicken & Waffles w/ watermelon (shared w/ bf): The chicken was fabulous. Although a lot Yelpers complained the chicken skin isn't crunchy enough, I still found it extremely yummy. The chicken was so moist and juicy. Never experienced a chicken like that. Even the chicken breast was so good!

The waffles were also perfect with the chicken. The waffles were crunchy and sweet and perfect. Not too dense and light.

-brussel sprouts w/bacon: The brussel sprouts were good; ours came with thick cuts of bacon. 

The stellar of the show was the chicken. I didn't want to get too full but next time I probably will just order my own. The dinner here was more satisfying than any buffet.",HxGrzjwaZ_VZkHbIrDABAQ,3,2,5,3hyOZIDHuubf94TfASEazQ

The deviled eggs came with some roe on top which as very unique, giving it a nice uniqueness than our typical deviled egg.  The BLT appetizer was actually quite good.  I didn't know what to expect but it was a thick, flavorful piece of pork belly on top of an apple?-flavored has brown.  Very good appetizer.  The brisket sandwich was good for a lunch but I'd steer towards the chicken at Yardbird.  The blue plate special is their specialty and either that or a chicken and waffle platter would be my recommendations.  Huge meals in total with a side of spicy watermelon and thick biscuit on the side.  The chicken was very tasty but not out-of-this-worldly.

Arrived at around 6 p.m. for a 615 reservation and We were immediately greeted and seated. Our server Courtney was awesome. Really can't say enough about her. She knew the menu. She suggested things based off of our comments and questions. And more importantly, she was overly attentive. For service like that i would return alone. 

To eat I had the honey buttermilk biscuits, Mac N Cheese, and the Shrimp & Grits(highlight).  The biscuits were cooked perfectly. Flaky and extremely soft. Also it came with 4 full size biscuits which was/is nice for sharing. The Mac N Cheese was my least fav dish of the night. It wasn't bad I honestly just expected more from it. Especially for the price and size(small dish). The Shrimp & Grits must be laced with crack because following the first bite I was hooked. As I'm writing this review I'm literally yearning for more Shrimp & Grits....order this! 

I had two mixed drinks that I can't recall; both were recommended by Courtney and she nailed it.  All and all a great time here and I will definitely come back however for the price i will have to be fully committed to spending big coin.

Secondly the service was well organized and great. There is never not a time when they are not attentive to your needs, and there are multiple individuals at all times rotating. Seating is selective so if you want an actual seat make sure to make a reservation. Otherwise if they are not packed .. which generally they always are, you can sit at the couches and eat there or even the bar. If you arrive when they open for brunch.. get there early because there will be a long line.

Ok the food... listen... just amazing. I had the waffle with chicken and spiced watermelon. The chicken is cooked for 27 hours and then fried... it was just perfect. The waffle was a cheddar waffle or you can choose just a regular sweet waffle, but trust you will love the savory cheddar waffle. The spiced watermelon ended the meal with a bang. The syrup is made with burbon or whiskey which you can really taste. They have a special hot spice which you have to try!  Overall cost for the fish was 36.00. You get four pieces of chicken I should add, so you will definitely be full. The chicken is cooked in pork lard but you can choose the gluten free option which takes just a tad bit longer to cook but still just as great! ( yes, I tried both)

The Mac and cheese is a four cheese blend and nothing short of amazing (my friend ordered and I had to try it).

Last but not least... the biscuits.. just trust me.. get some biscuits. So good! 


Overall ambiance was chill and causal. The restaurant is located in the Venetian on the first floor. You will be sad if you did not try this place.",REDGldj7B5NKmhljBK7mXg,2,2,5,boCsvOmpuaJS9EF4I-ORCQ

Notice fried chicken is not listed here, which is extremely disappointing given that the restaurant's name suggests that the chicken should be the star of the show.

The waffles from the chicken & waffles were probably the best waffles I've had. They were very crisp and light on the inside. The fried chicken that accompanied the waffles was crispy but had no flavor. It's sad when a fancy schmancy place can't beat a place like Popeye's or KFC for taste when it comes to fried chicken.

The chicken biscuits fared no better since the fried chicken was the same as the one from the chicken & waffles dish.

The shrimp & grits were good. The grits were very good, creamy and tasted good, unlike a lot of other places that can't do grits justice. The shrimp was cooked well and seasoned appropriately. 

If you go here and don't order anything with fried chicken, then you won't be disappointed, but if you do order anything with fried chicken, then don't get your hopes up.",izLeU7SgRLNA0QLiBEYbYA,1,0,3,At_ANUL7lKBXsv33AgMdHw

I think i cried a little inside (I hope my girlfriend didn't notice and I also hope she felt the same way too as well as my bff because if i'm gonna cry inside of happiness, i want everyone to cry along)

After extensive yelping, I found the perfect no fail restaurant. And by perfect I mean, Chicken and Waffles! 

**FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT $14 (house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, pimento cheese, frisée lemon vinaigrette) -- OH so Goooood. I do not know why, but i never liked pork belly. But here, the fat/meat ratio of it was so on point (thin layer of fat) that after being fried (i know!) made me feel less guilty than if it hadn't been fried! No, it's not supposed to make sense. It might've been a tad too cheesy but I enjoyed the two bites it lasted. 

**Jalapeno CORNBREAD -- Now, this was not on the menu for lunch (it's only on the dinner menu) but i still asked the server about it, she wasn't sure but went ahead into the kitchen to bring me the most amazing news i've hear that morning. They had it!!!! and so i had it!!!! and it was amazingly moist (a rarity for cornbread) since it was baked directly in the cast iron skillet. Excellent dish, the perfect carb side dish to all your other carb dishes. Can't forget how sexy it looked after the spooned butter started melting and sliding off it's curvy top.  

**FRIED CHICKEN N' WATERMELON N' WAFFLES $36 -- This is true about all the reviews here, it is truly extraordinary. The brining for 27 hours must be magical, and go figure why not a minute longer. Juicy, hot, the skin was so nicely crispy i even ate it (which i never do) because it didn't feel oily. The waffle was great too! I feel sad thinking about it already. When the attraction is so strong, it is just so hard to let go of the memory. 

**MACARONI & CHEESE $10 (trottole pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust) trottole is fancy for twisty. This effing cute ass mini dutch oven mac n cheese was possibly the best i have ever had in my life. And listen, i eat a lot and almost always order it when it's a southern restaurant. You can taste the high quality of the cheeses! Just perfection in the creaminess, saltiness, crunchiness of the crust. Excellent! we couldn't stop eating even though we were stuffed. 

The problem with this place is that there is absolutely nothing bad about the food! God dammit. I feel so vulnerable when I rank something 5 stars because then they know, that I have a weak spot. And I don't like that...

Deviled Eggs
Yardbird Old Fashioned ×2
Mama's Chicken Biscuits
Bacon-Butterscotch Cake
Coffee

I was raised on a farmer's diet in IL and I work a desk job in Seattle now. I grew up with the idea that food was love and I get very picky about anything I love. I love biscuits, I love fried chicken, and I love coffee. Check, check, and check.

My biggest complaint is actually that the flavor of my two old fashions was inconsistent. The bar probably accidentally doubled the bitters in the first one, as the second was much sweeter and tasted more of the Buffalo Trace. I've never been one to complain about extra kick in my cocktails though, so I let it be.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. It was a Tuesday night and they may have been overstaffed. Food came quickly and water glasses were never empty. The manager came to check on us and was similarly friendly and engaging.

Hahaha OMG YASSS so good! Definitely go. Haha so embarrassing I went 3 times in 3 days - but at all different times I swear! Lunch, Dinner, and Brunch.
So, first, obviously - the fried chicken and waffles. Delicious - the fried chicken is really good, but it's the combination with the kinda savory waffle + maple syrup, plus there's watermelon on the side...I ate it with my hands. No utensils. I had it at dinner, but I think it's on the menu no matter what time of day. There is an awesome salad that is only on the lunch menu - a low+slow smoked chicken salad. Like so good - it's more chicken than salad though, not a lot of lettuce (which I was kinda happy about) and there is a slice of pan-fried cornbread on the bottom that like soaks up the dressing. That smoked chicken is no joke man. The cornbread is good, but their biscuits are good too - I wouldn't be able to say which is better. The plain biscuits come with a homemade apple jam that is really good. At dinner I also tried the short ribs - which were good, but not anywhere near the chicken items so I'd stick to chicken haha. There is a fried green tomato BLT appetizer (pork belly!) that I got 2 out of 3 times haha. I didn't get any cocktails but they all sounded good.

Clearly I love food a little too much. Let me know if you like it!

So, the bartenders told me they were thinking of opening a location on the west coast - either LA or Hawaii. I hope they choose Hawaii bc if it's LA, I will overdose on fried chicken.",nbAsseRd4MTq_JApjeBZyA,0,1,5,nK4sicN3MqVy2rr94USHtg

Fried chicken w/ watermelon and waffles ($32): The fried chicken was full of flavor and quite juicy on the inside.  The waffles were good, but the whiskey syrup was definitely a bit too much...especially if you've been shootin' whiskey all trip long...

Burger ($18): I wasn't a huge fan of this burger.  While the flavors were good, it was too much.  This tasted like something you would order at the heart attack grill...full of grease, meat, bacon, and sauce.  I'm more of a traditional burger guy, though I do make exceptions.  Because they add pork to their patty meat, they have to cook the patty medium well, which made it dry.  For comparison, Slater's 50/50 has the same concept but pulls it off better.  The fries that came with the dish were fried perfectly.  

While service was decent and the food was solid, the prices leave much to be desired but you already know that when eating on the strip so I won't deduct stars.

My cousin had been to the Yardbird in Miami a couple years ago so we made a pit stop here as she wanted to reminisce and it's never really a bad time for another cocktail in Vegas! 

There was not any space for us in the lounge for six people but there was at the bar.  We pulled up a few bar stools and ordered with the bartender.  My husband is really into Old Fashioned's right now as he's been making them at home and ordering them wherever he can.  All the guys got that, and us three girls ordered something different to try.  My cousin got Watermelon Sling which was really nice and refreshing.  Her friend got the Blind Lemon Shandy.  I usually don't mind shandys because I like the light taste of lemon, but it wasn't her thing.  She mentioned it to the bartender and the bartender gracefully made her another - which she decided on another Watermelon Sling.  I had a taste of the shandy and thought it was ok - a little too sour even for me.  As for me, I got the Blackberry Bourbon.  I'm into sweet and fruity drinks so I did like this - but thought the Watermelon Sling was the winner out of the three.

The guys really enjoyed the Old Fashioned.  My husband enquired about what kind of bourbon they used for it because it tasted a little smokey.  It's really neat because they infuse the bourbon in-house with bacon fat!  He was really interested in it that when we got home he started researching how to do it himself.

My boyfriend ordered the swine burger and loved it! We also tried the mac and cheese as an appetizer and we were not disappointed. 

We really wanted to try the peach cobbler but we were stuffed, so went back for brunch two days later. I got their biscuits and gravy. It was good but so much food! I'm not OCD about my food touching but I would've liked the eggs and bacon on the side instead of on top of the biscuits, so maybe keep that in mind if having your food touching bothers you.

We had a few special drinks... The Watermelon Sling and the Dark Chocolate infused bourbon, both drinks were a little pricey($15 & $19). As for our appetizer, the Fried Green Tomatoes with in-house slab of thick smoked bacon..OMG... this could be an entree it's so delicious. Trust me you would want a few orders of these it tastes so dam good. Great suggestion by our waiter Tracy, aka ""Hatch"" 

I had the Short Rib which had great flavor and it wasn't overcooked. The cauliflower mashed were delicious, it tasted like potatoes. We also shared an order of delicious collard greens for the table. Their Fried Chicken was just as expected before being made more healthy Lol.. No words can explain...it is a must have! 

Desert was an art piece. It was a Chocolate Plant in a chocolate pot.

Let me start by saying that the majority of my food was delicious, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  MY wife ordered the chicken and mac & cheese, which was satisfactory.  I would have given this a four-star review.  

HOWEVER, I had one grey, veiny shrimp in my dish, which was obviously undercooked compared to the rest on the plate.  When I informed my waiter, he brought it back to the chef, who stated that shrimp from Florida do not change color like normal shrimp (even though the other five shrimp on my plate were more than deliciously colored), and assured me that it was indeed cooked through.  Not being one to think I am above making mistakes, I tried it- still obviously grey and undercooked.

We wanted a light lunch and the place was not busy so we immediately go a table. A good sign?

I ordered the Florida Heirloom Tomatoes salad. It was awful, oh I mean GOD awful. It was like a bowl of soup. Yes I know tomatoes are wet, but these 'cherry' tomatoes were old...wrinkly old and did I mention wet. I'm not sure I knew what to expect, with this dish, but it was the wrong grouping of ingredients, horrible textures and just inedible. 

I also order some roasted heirloom fingerling potatoes. 30 minutes after I got my 'salad' came the potatoes...not fingerling potatoes, but baby potatoes...(there is a difference) and they were swimming in oil. No real hint of roasting...but very very very oily...super oily.

As I become more aware of the food I eat...this was a waste of calories.

3517720,2015-05-05,4,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I've been in love with southern food since a family trip through the south back in 1982. Since then I've had my share of southern dishes, but a recent trip to Yardbird in the Palazzo/Venetian for a friend's birthday has given me an even greater appreciation for the cuisine.

Standouts dishes included chicken 'n waffles with some of the best fried chicken I've had in town topping crispy and airy cheese filled waffles that puts to shame any similar dish. The St. Louis style pork ribs were coated with a dry rub with much depth, giving it hints of sweetness and smokiness with restrained heat. The low and slow smoked chicken salad may not catch the eye of most diners but it's a dish that shouldn't be overlooked. Other notable dishes were the pot pie and fall-off-the-bone-tender short ribs atop charred corn grits.

Desserts were equally amazing. With the bacon butterscotch cake, I've finally found a sweet dish that uses bacon effectively. Devoid of a cold, rubbery texture, the bacon is used perfectly to enhance the cake flavor. For traditional southern-style desserts you won't want to miss their seasonal cobblers or the chess pie.

There wasn't a a single bad item on the night and with dish after dish blowing me away, Yardbird has quickly made its way onto my list of favorite restaurants.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,11,8,5,TNDj2IEZPJfxASh0WHzpcg

We ended up sitting at the bar where typically you get better service. Not today, hard to even order and get our check. They all seemed more concerned with setting up all the bottles just right on the back of the bar instead of checking on customers. I will assume that was hopefully a one time experience. Service (1/5)

As for the food...expect huge portions and some damn tasty fried chicken! The chicken was so moist and the meat had so much flavor for chicken. Their long prep process does a chicken good!
Also don't miss their version of deviled eggs. Again huge, and piled high. (4/5)

3524654,2017-11-20,4,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Finally got to try this place out and I have to say the food was pretty good! The only reason I gave this place a 3 star versus a 4 Star review was the value of the food for the price.

My friend and I ordered the fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits, and the BLT. My favorite dish was the BLT because of the crunch factor from the fried tomato while also retaining the sweet juiciness on the inside. Just wanna say that I normally only eat tomato if it is diced or in a burger, but I would order the BLT again. The bacon was on point as well. The fried chicken was pretty good in terms of crunch and flavor, but way overpriced for the amount you get and for what it is. There wasn't a wow factor or a unique take on the dish. Glad that we opted for just the fried chicken and not the special dish that comes with fried chicken, waffles, and a few pieces of watermelon for like $35. The biscuits were really tasty with the butter and jam that they give you, but again not worth paying $7 for 4 pieces.

Overall, the meal was really good and I would recommend this place if you haven't been here yet. The prices do reflect the fact that it is a restaurant on the strip, but it would be nice if they did some special takes on their dishes to justify the price. I can't help but think that the food I can order here can be bought at a much cheaper price elsewhere and still taste just as good.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,5,4,3,RFmEaBsV1d5EA3Ue5SmArg

From the time we walked in to the time we left, they definitely know ""southern hospitality"". The service and the food was good! We got there around 10:20 AM on a Saturday morning and this was the perfect time. As we were leaving around 11:55 AM it was packed and a line to get in. I would definitely recommend going closer to when they open on the weekends if you don't want to wait. Even getting there early, we had a 10 min wait. While we waited they allowed us to sit in the lounge area and were very accommodating. They got us drinks and whatever we needed. I will also say they are a little on the pricy side. For lunch for 2 meals (Shrimp & Grits and Chicken & Waffles), 1 side of Grits, 1 appetizer (Deviled Eggs), and 1 drink (Peach Lemonade) and including tip it totaled out to be $119. 

We started by ordering a side of Grits for our baby girl and the Deviled Eggs. The Grits were good and had a great flavor. They definitely tasted homemade. The Deviled Eggs were awesome as well. I thought I wasn't going to like the Roe on-top at first, but I couldn't even taste it. If I did I didn't notice it. The cream of the eggs was good as well. It was a little thicker than what I am used too but it was bad. It was more of a stiff consistency than loose, but overall a good taste.

I ordered the Shrimp & Grits and my husband ordered the  Chicken-n-Waffle-n-Watermelon. My dish was pretty good. It wasn't the best Shrimp & Grits I have had but it wasn't bad. The sauce or ""roux"" was different but good. It wasn't a creamy onion and pepper based roux that I am used too. It was more like a thick broth. It had good flavor though. The Shrimp was cooked pretty well, but lacked a little in flavor. They could of used a tad more seasoning.

My husband's Chicken-n-Waffle-n-Watermelon was pretty darn good! It comes with the breast, the leg and the wing. It was full of flavor! The Waffle was a Cheddar Waffle but it was cooked perfectly. The Chicken was brined and then pressured fried to perfection. The skin had the perfect crunch. The chicken was tender and juice, including the breast. It was also served with a Bourbon Maple Syrup and Hot Honey Sauce. Both were amazing. This was honestly some of the best Syrup I have had from a restaurant. It was so flavorful and you could actually taste the Bourbon, it was definitely present. The Hot Honey Sauce was good and added a different flavor as well. The watermelon had a slightly spiced taste. It wasn't super spicy but just enough to taste and add a different component to the dish. It was good and different.  I even stopped eating my dish to eat his with him. Lol. Overall, this was a well put together dish. 

I also had their Peach Lemonade. Honestly, it didn't really taste like peach to me. It was also very sweet or syrupy. It was good but had a thick taste as far as texture. It basically felt heavy to drink, if that makes sense. 

Overall, Yardbird was a great experience from start to finish. The food was overall pretty good and I would definitely come back again when I'm in an area that has one.

These fried green tomatoes come with house smoked pork belly (I got without), pimento cheese, frisee, smoky tomato jam and lemon vinaigrette. They were delicious, even though I could easily have eaten 5x as many. 

I also ordered the herb garden Caesar salad, served with egg whites, red onion, dried tomatoes and Parmesan capers. Capers are so good, but again, they're not incredibly common. 

My boyfriend opted for crispy chicken biscuits with pepper jelly, as well as the herb garden Caesar salad.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Southern meal without some good ole bourbon! I loved the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade (substituted with Makers), while Sean sipped on the Southern Peach.

3567925,2015-05-19,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I must have walked by this restaurant a dozen times, gazing through the open doors and thinking to myself; this is exactly what I pictured a ""Southern Table and Bar"" to look like.  Finally after two weeks in Vegas I finally made a reservation for dinner, I wanted to see if the food could stand up to the décor and my anticipation.

Everything about this restaurant screamed the South. The walls were covered with reclaimed wood and adorned with Mason jars filled with an assortment of colorful pickled vegetables. The lighting was subtle, as Edison Lights illuminate the dining room. The menu was eclectic in its simplicity with items from Shrimp n Grits, Fried Chicken and Cornbread to Smoked and Roasted Bone Marrow, Grilled Florida Cobia and Roasted Fingerling Potatoes.

The server came to our table and informed us that their portion sizes were quite large and that we may want to consider sharing plates family style rather than ordering individually. She also told us that the Yardbird was known for it's chicken, specially brined for a minimum of 27 hours prior to serving, providing a great unique flavor while keeping the chicken moist and juicy. Well, how do you turn that down?  We ordered a couple starters: Deviled Eggs and the Fried Bread + Butter Pickle Spears. For the main dished we ordered: Shrimp n' Grits, Yardbird Salisbury Steak and Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken. This of course needed some side dishes: Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. 

I know, it sounds like a lot of food but there were three ""well groomed"" foodies sitting at the table and the portions were not as big as she lead us to believe. Overall the food was good; there were some highs and a few lows.  Personally I found the Deviled Eggs to be a little flat, some salt and maybe a touch of heat would have made a world of difference. The fried pickles were good, but the spears made them difficult to manage and they definitely retained a lot of heat; all three of us burned our mouths with the first bite.  The Shrimp n Grits were really good, the grits were creamy, yet held texture and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The Salisbury Steak was delicious. The meat fell apart as you put it into your mouth and it was well pared with trumpet mushrooms and sherry gravy. The Skillet Cornbread had a slower start, it first it was a little too moist and lacked the chew one expects from a decent cornbread, however the more I ate it, the more I enjoyed it. The fresh pieces or corn and jalapeno added an extra layer of flavor that really elevated the dish. The Macaroni & Cheese was nice, Torchio pasta and a creamy artisanal cheese sauce blanketed with a crunchy herb topping (we ordered 2 of these, it was pretty good).  Where the food fell short was the item they pushed the most, the Fried Chicken. This was something that I could easily make at home with my eyes closed and one hand tied behind my back. The crust was bland and unseasoned; the only thing going for it was it stayed crunchy. The chicken didn't weather much better. Although it was moist, it seriously lacked any depth of flavor and desperately cried out for some salt. Even though I enjoyed the majority of the other items we had ordered, I really had a hard time looking past the chicken. 

To wrap this up, I may have set my expectations a little higher than I should have as I was really taken in by the appearance of the restaurant and the sales pitch from the server. In the end I had a good meal with some good people and I enjoyed the Yardbird, but I wasn't amazed as I had hoped to be.",rG-gVq26S4rJCiG8Lk4T-g,2,0,3,H6MYipra0O3nsUn7xHU3kQ

+gluten free fried chicken

Really wanted to try this place the last few times I've been in Vegas. While I note 3 stars for having gluten free fried chicken, the chicken itself was horrible. Dry, way to spicy, and had no real crunch. I've made better gluten free chicken at home cheaper than $30. 

The service was great at first then quickly lead to a downhill battle of when would he get the check, etc back and forth. This is another typical ""dress up the inside real nice"" and attract the tourists spot, at least in my opinion or experience when I went. 

They also take 30+ extra minutes for the gluten free chicken which was the reason I went. However next time I'll find a better spot. A+ for effort though, I appreciate any restaurant giving gluten free patrons a substitute.",Z_8clYC-IkqrfHcTCjzAiA,5,2,3,FaAJxZ3IVNBUBgxLJTqR2A

We ordered the friend green tomato blt, the slow pulled chicken salad and the wing with pickled okra. 

The fried green tomato BLT was incredible! Crispy, crunchy, tart fried tomatoes topped with pimento cheese, large slices of pork belly and frisée. It was salty, creamy and pure bliss. We loved this dish.

The wings were some of the best we've ordered. Double fried and tossed with a perfect buffalo sauce. Served with pickled okra that added a little sour to the salty wings and paired perfectly. The wings were served with a homemade buttermilk ranch sauce and we wanted more of it because it was so good. 

The slow pulled chicken salad was a large portion, full of flavorful smoked chicken, corn, layered on top of a piece of fried cornbread and buttermilk ranch with frisée tossed in a vinaigrette. It was unique and tasty. Very filling and full of lots of wonderful flavors

The only issue we had was that the bartender wasn't attentive to us. I ordered our blt appetizer right when we initially sat down, as I knew that was one thing I wanted to order and it took over 25 minutes to come out, after our entrees. He didn't apologize or say anything it and I was pretty surprised by that. He seemed irritated in general, even with other customers so I didn't bother saying anything. We had to wave him down for drinks and to order.

3594504,2016-12-12,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"So, after seeing and hearing about all these rave reviews, I decided I had to try Yardbird on my most recent visit to Vegas.

We came in for brunch, and had a pleasant experience - But, maybe I just can not differentiate REALLY GOOD Southern cuisine and just... good... southern cuisine.  I had some fried chicken, which was good, but I've had better.

The eggs served with said brunch were good, but I had a better product from Bouchon the day before. So, not sure if that's really fair. I also found the gravy to be kind of bland and creamy smooth - Is that the point of white gravy? I prefer sodium bombed (salty. flavorful) gravy, ladened chunks of breakfast sausage. The gravy wasn't awful, but it was not awe inspiring to me.

I quite enjoyed the biscuits that were served, and, again, I'm no connoisseur of biscuits in general, but my dining companion informed me that they were mythical. So, there's that to be said.

We did enjoy some wonderful service, and the decor is pretty rad.

I would return, but I'm just not in any hurry. particularly at the Vegas price point. 3 stars is not meant to be an insult. This time, it probably means I need to get an education in Southern food.",awQhT121Pe0R33sukfTyuA,0,0,3,U3HIFKFdBuqpXKTWZ3ibow

Nevertheless, I did my very best and managed to try a goodly amount of Yardbird's fare, and, lo, it was delicious.

Everything from the cocktails (loved the Southern Revival, with whiskey, passion fruit, and basil--I'm a sucker for anything passion fruit, but this was especially well balanced...not too sweet; according to my compatriots, the old fashioned was killer, too) to the fried chicken sliders (on biscuits as flaky as all get-out) to the kale salad (a nice counterpoint to all the heavy food--kale, apple, whiskey-soaked raisins, cheddar cheese, all in a light vinaigrette).

We were at a table adjacent to the kitchen, which is fun--you get to see the magic happening--but it's a bit chaotic, too. Overall, the ambience is great...dim lighting, a modern take on Southern style.

3645004,2017-02-02,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I'd read about the fried chicken for weeks, and had anticipated enjoying a stellar version of this dish.  Being a Vegas restaurant, I realized it wouldn't be cheap, but I don't mind paying for really good food.

I ordered from the bar. Service was excellent and knowledgeable.  I had a cold pilsner while I waited.  As it turned out, the half chicken arrived in less than two minutes.  A wing, thigh, leg and breast came with a small ramekin of honey based sauce.  Unfortunately, the chicken was tepid, and the coating soggy.  The skin beneath the coating was flaccid.  

I really didn't use much of the honey sauce, because the breading was already wet.   The chicken itself was good quality, but I suspect had been sitting under a lamp for quite some time.  I scoffed it down quickly before it got cold. 

The bartender asked me how I liked it, and I answered honestly.  He apologized and offered to replace it (I really should have asked when it arrived) and I declined.   Minutes later, a very sincerely concerned manager arrived, and explained that pressure frying did not result in crispy chicken (which I believe KFC had proven otherwise.)  He was polite, and sincerely wanted my feedback.  In the end, they comped the $18 draft beer on the bill.  It was a nice gesture.  I'm certain it is a well managed restaurant, but if you are expecting to be wowed by this signature dish, you might want to look at some other menu items.",PKzt4KMQpQIRSvOYo3EdFw,1,0,3,jWiaw44iHBSKQlpr5Ae8Ow

3661919,2017-05-19,11,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Late 2011, I was reading a culinary trade publication article which referenced the opening of Chef John McInnis' Yardbird Southern Table & Bar in Miami.  I kept this restaurant in mind as my husband is a fried chicken-loving man.  Alas, the closest that I got to Miami since 2011 was a visit to Atlanta, GA on business so, Yardbird got put to the back of my mind.

However, since I joined Yelp (late 2013) and continued reading culinary news, it was exciting to find Yardbird had opened in Las Vegas, NV.  Yelp friends began submitting reviews and my taste buds were further excited and Las Vegas is a closer destination for us.  

Knowing how popular this restaurant is, I made reservations through Open Table a week before coming to LV.  The restaurant is located just outside of the Venetian Resort's Casino (near cashier) and start of the restaurant row. 

We were quickly checked in and seated by the lovely and friendly hostess.  Our server came by to deliver menus, describe their specialties of the house and take our beverage orders (Hubs:  Teneya Creek Hefeweisen & Me:  Icky IPA).  Meanwhile, I was starting to feel my ""camera call"" and tried to be as stealth as possible while enjoying the energetic vibes and relaxed Southern Rustic décor.  As I sat back down, the following exchange occurred.

""Are you a gambling gal?"" Asked a man dressed in black as an opening line. 
ME:  Yes, why?
HIM:  If you can tell me how many jars are in the ceiling light fixture, I'll give you a free dessert of your choice.  BUT, you only have 5 seconds to give me an answer.                           
ME:  Ok, as I looked upward and started counting rows and columns while multiplying in my mind""....uh, the 5 seconds were up and I gave my answer which was totally WRONG! 
HIM:  Well, just for playing, I'll still give you dessert...you ought to try the Peach Cobbler and advised to order it when placing our dinner order.  He left a dessert menu on our table then he walked away.

Wow!  We felt so special and welcomed by such gracious Southern charm.  I didn't see anyone else getting this awesome treatment (although, I'm sure there were others).  We were certainly thankful for this additional treat.

Our server, Mandy, returned with our beverages and I inquired who that man was...she said, aw, he's our manager, Randy.  She also said that he had told her to comp our dessert for playing.   We placed our food orders.

SMALL PLATE & SHAREABLE:
Smoked & Roasted Bone Marrow served with onion marmalade & toasted country bread $11. It's not as weird as it sounds but it's rich ""meat butter"".  Its silky, savory, fatty and ""nutty"" characteristics blew us away.  Even though my cholesterol levels probably jumped tens of points, it was worth it!

FROM THE GARDEN:  
Charred okra in browned butter, sprinkled with Cotija and lemon juice $10.  Impressive charring and preparation which minimized the typical sliminess.  The salty Cotija cheese was like the American South's version of a fine Reggiano Parmesan.

MAMA'S BISCUITS:
Classic Buttermilk with honey butter and house made jam, 4/order $7.  Light, airy and flaky rolled biscuits that makes you appreciate great authentic home cooking of the South.

THE BIRD:
Llewelyn's Fine Fried Chicken - 1/2 of Yardbird's famous bird served with honey hot sauce.  $26.  All 4 pieces (White & dark) were flavorful, juicy and generously portioned.  The seasoning or brine of this bird was mouthwatering and IF we only came here for the fried chicken without ordering the other sides, I think I could've eaten the whole order.  Oops! I admit that I'm an ""oinker"" in the chicken coop.

DESSERT:
Peach Cobbler - marzipan crumble, French vanilla ice cream, Florentine almond cookie bowl and cinnamon twist (Comped $15).  Thank you, Randy, for your hospitality and amiability.  I'm already fan of American desserts but Yardbird's version of Peach Cobbler tickled my fancy.  As full as I was, I almost couldn't stop eating this dessert.

After paying our bill, we went to thank Randy for his hospitality and wished him well on his upcoming trip to Singapore as Opening Manager.  He graciously showed us Yardbird's private dining room/event room and ""sister"" restaurant, Chica (Latin cuisine), also owned and founded by John Kunkel.

Doesn't really explain why they didn't do that in the first place since they took a while to set up our table.... Next we were informed by the waitress that she could make our meals for us as in we'll just give her the criteria and she'll proceed with it. This is good because we had some pretty indecisive people in our group and we ended up getting almost everything we wanted to try. Great experience overall and I love that the meals are shared with everybody so everyone got to try everything.

The food quality itself is sort of an adapted taste though. Due to the nature of this restaurant, they tend to put a lot of cheese on everything. I personally do not prefer cheese most of the time.

It is the kind of fried chicken that the wannabee chicken imposters can only dream to achieve. The chicken is cooked perfectly: crispy and extra juicy. It's like slow cooked chik fil a (I love chik fil a so that's a huge compliment). Everything else we ordered here was also an ""omg this is so amazing"" type of deal. 

The best part was the server told the birthday girl to choose a dessert on the house. We went for the banana pudding and our server brought it out with a candle. The banana pudding is legit. It's rich but the flavors are explosive to the taste buds.

Obviously there are an unlimited number of options here and we both enjoy trying a new place so I hop on yelp and was surprised by the high number of positive reviews for Yardbird so we jumped in a car and headed over. 

It's located inside the Venetian hotel. Just follow the ""Restaurant Row"" signage throughout the casino and you can't miss it. This place is a GEM! They have lounge seating in the front with couches and bar tables with music playing and more traditional restaurant seating in the back. Originally we had reservations for a table but once we arrived we realized we liked the lounge vibe and energy in the front so we switched upon arrival and the host was VERY accommodating. 

Even though it was busy our server was AMAZING! She was extremely personable and very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my wife ordered fried chicken and biscuits. Also added a bottle of champagne with mixers for mimosas. I would caution against the passion fruit juice because it was pretty bitter but otherwise we mixed our own drinks with orange juice and were just fine. 
We both loved our food and the service was fantastic. We ordered the peach cobbler which was very good as well but couldn't believe it was $25!

Hands down it was the best fried chicken I've ever had. It was large enough that with an appetizer it was plenty for two people, and at $36 was an extremely affordable choice for two people,  especially on the strip. 

The desserts were amazing as well, and again, extremely large. We tried deep fried oreos, and the bacon bourbon cake. Much too large to eat at once, but our waiter gave us plastic utensils and a to go box to enjoy in our room the next night.

I tried a couple small plates and the low and slow cooked chicken salad. I had the spiced watermelon which was served chilled. Sounds weird but it works! I also had the biscuits with butter and jam. They were tasty but a little on the hard side. The highlight was my salad. It was far from your traditional salad and one of the best dishes I've ever had! The dish starts out with a yogurt and caper sauce under a perfectly fried corn bread square. Diced slow smoked chicken was served on top with frisee. The bitterness of the frisee paired perfectly with the salty chicken and sweet cornbread. I could not have asked for a better brunch dish. You must get this salad if you come to Yardbird. The place is not cheap, you'll probably spend $25+ on brunch/lunch. But then again, all restaurants in Vegas hotels are pricey. Service was pretty good and the bathroom was clean.

After making some reservations on Open Table for 6:30pm we were expecting to arrive on time. Unfortunately traffic that night was a disaster and missed the original time. Ended up calling the restaurant to move the reservation 3 times! They were friendly on the phone and super understanding. Once we arrived around 7:20pm we we promptly seated in the front of the restaurant.

The decor was super cool! Staff was more than just friendly, they made us feel like a valued customer, not just a another tourist. The conversation we had with the Scott (the manager) was genuine. 

The Food: The chicken, shrimp and grits, green beans, mac & cheese and corn bread! 
The breading on the chicken was light and crisp! The shrimp and grits was my favorite. Totally forgot that Scott had brought us the fried green tomato with Pork belly... A M A Z I N G!

Really great ambience, someone took tremendous care in designing and constructing a rustic but also somehow elegant southern dining room.  Truly great service from our waiter.  He could answer all of our questions down to the spices in the sausage or the pickle brine, they brine their our pickles, okra, and red onions.  All were excellent.  He knowledgeable and passionate about the local tap list they offer and we got to try some local brews on a sampler flight.  Blackberry bourbon cocktail (I subbed vodka) was wonderful.  The special was a  biscuits and gravy with an outstanding gravy, fried chicken, eggs, and house made bacon.  The gravy wasn't too thick with a lot of house made sausage.  Fried chicken is what this place in known for and for good reason!  The biscuits were good, they didn't stand out next to the other things on the plate but nor should they.  Yardbird's bacon is amazing!  Sometimes house made bacon gets carried away with the salt, this didn't, it has great flavor (maybe the best I have had) and was cooked in a way that held up with the gravy for a little while which was appreciated on this dish.

Boy, it did not disappoint!

I started off with the Violet Beauregarde Old Fashioned. It had Patron in it which intrigued me...and Tequila Lisa wanted to come out. It was very tasty, not too strong but you can definitely taste the tequila. 

The biscuits are sooooo addicting. Still nice and warm when brought out to the table, soft and fluffy on the inside. Eat it with their honey butter...ooohwee!

The chicken and waffles is the dish to order, it's actually their most popular dish. Everything about it made me so happy. The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and perfect with the honey hot sauce. Waffles were warm and fluffy, drizzled with the bourbon maple syrup that wasn't overly sweet either. I'm a waffles kinda gal.

We also ordered the mac n cheese and crispy brussel sprouts to accompany the chicken and waffles and both were really good as well. 

Our server was very accommodating and friendly. He checked on us frequently, and made a few trips back to the kitchen to ask about cinnamon being in any of the dishes for my friend who is allergic.

We arrived about twenty minutes early but they took us right away which was pretty cool. The bar area and the front of the restaurant was packed and very loud which made me a little nervous at first. We were seated at the back part of the place which not nearly as loud. 

The decor was simple but classy. I loved the plates they used, and I wanted to take them home ha ha.

Originally I wanted to try the chicken, watermelon and waffle dinner. But I wasn't nearly as hungry as I hoped to be, my fault. So I decided to try the swine burger instead. The fries were crisp and seasoned perfectly. My oh my, the burger was so juicey and they don't skimp on the cheese. I ordered mine with no sauce but it arrived with the sauce so I had to send it back which I hate to do. I did get bonus fries though. The food came out rather quickly for it being so busy. My boyfriend got the fried chicken and ordered a side of Mac and cheese. He loved the Mac and cheese and the chicken was falling off the bone.

3754283,2018-01-26,10,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird Southern Table & Bar [YST&B]. (3.6 stars).

""Yardbird: a common nickname used for Shipyard workers.""

I chuckled when I first heard the name.

How appropriate!!

Our friends made reservations & we were excited to join them for a FRIED CHICKEN meal.

As our server stated upon seating us, the chicken used at YST&B is brined for 27 hours prior to frying them.

I was really excited to bite into a nice, juicy, crispy chicken until we were informed by our server that YST&B's chicken isn't very crispy.

After hearing that I sighed ever so quietly...

We decided to order the following:

Lewellyn's Fried Chicken. (3 stars).

As someone who loves CRISPY fried chicken. I have to say, this version was moist & juicy but not crispy.

To say I was disappointed would be an understatement!!

The skin is fried, however, it is still a bit soft & flaccid.

I'm going to guess that the brining process that is used makes these chickens moist. But it doesn't allow for the skin to crisp up due to the fact that all that moisture from the brine has been soaked into the chicken skin itself.

The chicken itself was flavorful.

Tip: DO NOT just bite into a piece of chicken. I made that mistake & bit into a chicken bone. Owwww!! That's all I have to say...

I suppose if my friends wanted to come back to eat Lewellyn's fried chicken, I would accompany them. But I can't say I would go out of my way to order this again.

The chicken comes with a honey hot sauce which is too sweet for me, but it does add some flavor & heat to the bird.

Shrimp & Grits. (4 stars).

I enjoyed this dish. The shrimps were plump & meaty.

Thankfully, the shrimp were deveined & the shell was removed, thus only leaving the tail to discard.

The grits were coarse which I appreciated as I'm not a fan of creamy grits.

Aside from the onions, which I just moved to the side, I was impressed with this dish.

The sauce was a nice accompaniment but didn't have much of a flavor profile. I wondered why until I read the menu again. The sauce is made with chicken jus & PBR...

There is more than enough to share if u r ordering other items as well.

Collard Greens. (3.5 stars).

I really enjoyed these collard greens.

They weren't terribly vinegar in nature & were made fresh to order.

There was still a light crunch to them which I appreciated. I have had some bad experience with mushy collard greens so it was nice to have a dish that was made properly.

The menu said that this dish was supposed to come with cracklins but I never saw or tasted any. Shucks. That would have been a nice touch.

Peach Cobbler. (3.5 stars).

There's something about eating a fresh peach cobbler that has just come out of an oven!!

The peaches come out soft & sweet.

The ice cream & tweedle were delicious.

The cold ice cream paired nicely with the warm cobbler.

The only thing I was hoping for was more of a crisp or crumble on top.

The cinnamon stick that accompanies this dessert seemed to be ""out of place"" in my opinion.

WARNING: Order this dessert when ur first seated. It takes 30 minutes to make...

Manhattan Boulevard. (4 stars).

STRONG DRINK!!

Jim Beam Rye & Carpano Antica paired with the Campari ice cube was both a beautiful presentation as well as a satisfying drink.

I'm not a whiskey connoisseur, but I enjoyed this drink.

***

Service was great... in the beginning.

Our server was friendly but when we finally decided to order the peach cobbler, at the end of our meal, he looked annoyed.

After he put our order in, he left for the evening leaving us with a friendly young lady.

I understand that we were told to order the cobbler at the beginning of our meal but we weren't certain whether we would be able to finish our meal & dessert.

I just felt like he could've tried to contain his disdain. LOL.

To be fair, YST&B was packed, so maybe he felt like we were prolonging our stay when there were customers waiting for a table??

The company more than made up for the awkward service, but I still felt like we shouldn't have been treated that way.

My friend wasn't looking at our server when he made a facial expression, which was a good thing.

It was nice to try YST&B, but I'm still looking for that perfect fried chicken outside of Atlanta...",Z67zFhSzaTDiIMKtVcuFFw,19,15,4,g-nVQeqniuZO6AbKes1DTA

I was a bit skeptical about the chicken, waffles and watermelon entree after seeing photos since it didn't look very large, but I took a chance and ordered it anyway. I am SO happy I did.

We were seated on a couch and armchairs which was comfortable but kind of awkward for eating. They serve everything family-style so everyone gets to share whatever the table orders. 

I went with three other people and we shared one appetizer, two sides and two entrees. To start we had the deviled eggs which were extremely flavorful with chives, cayenne and roe on top. Easily the best deviled eggs I have ever had!

After the appetizer, our first entree of chicken and waffles came it along with a side of green beans. The fried chicken was crispy and came as four different cuts of meat. They brine the chicken for 27 hours and it really makes a difference in the flavor. The cheddar waffle was thick and Belgian-sized. The green beans came in a yogurt sauce and were perfectly cooked, not too crispy or mushy. 

The roasted cauliflower came out next with Moonshine soaked raisins which was a really cool touch. 

Our final entree of shrimp and grits came out last and someone came from the kitchen to apologize for the delay because the cook messed up the order. We really didn't mind since we were busy eating all the other deliciousness and it was appreciated that they let us know about the delay. The service in the restaurant overall was impeccable.

what i ate:
- fried chicken and waffles and watermelon: yes yes yes soooo good. i loved the crispy fried chicken skin (although i have to say, the second time i went the skin was not as crispy as i would have liked), married with the sweet/savory waffles and the oh so refreshing spiced watermelon chunks. i loved loved loved the relish??  that came on the waffles. spicy, vinegary, savory, perfect balance for everything else. all the flavors you would want are on this plate. i know it's meant for sharing, but i think i could finish it all on my own. but yea, sharing is caring, so split this with your table, be a good friend. 
- fried green tomato BLT: this was probably my favorite dish of the night. i wasnt expecting much, but seriously, it met all the flavors i would want in a dish - salty, sweet, hot, cold, savory, acidic, cheesy/creamy, fried... it was so good. every bite was delicious. the second time i went i insisted on ordering this dish again, and my friends were wowed by it
- pork croquette: this was a stick to your ribs kind of dish. while the croquette itself was fairly small, the black eyed pea cassoulet underneath was dense, just as the croquette. i thought this dish was good, but it needed something vinegary or pickled to lighten up the flavors. unless you just want something hearty and rich, then this is the dish for you. 
- chilled watermelon: this was a refreshing side. but, rather unsurprising? especially if you ordered the fried chicken and waffles and watermelon. if you didnt get that dish, this would be a welcome addition to your table. the chilled watermelon was sweet and juicy, and the spices give it a nice zing. 
- maple glazed bacon donut: who doesnt love bacon? i love it, and put it on anything and i automatically like it. but, these donuts were rather dense cake style donuts. i wish they were the lighter type. after a bite i was done. too rich for me. 
- bbq pork belly: this dish, in my opinion, was the better dish to go for instead of the pork croquette. the pork belly was fatty, rich, perfectly glazed, and the pickled salad side was a great palette cleanser. 
- bloody mary: perfectly spiced. WITH BACON. what more can i say? drink your hangover away with these bad boys
- watermelon sling: so so so refreshing! on a hot summer day, you want to drink this. yes, that whiskey burned it's way back up your throat giving you that warm dragon breath effect, but the sweet refreshing watermelon made it easy to gulp down. 

pros:
- the food was so good. i loved the play between rich fried foods and vinegary sides. stick to your ribs kind of food. so, ladies, don't wear anything without stretch, your stomach needs it
- decor: wood, metal, so rustic, so chic. loved the old fashioned light bulbs. loved the huge chandelier
- service was friendly.
- called night of to make a rez on a friday night, and was able to get a table no problem
- drinks were legit with ice cubs cut to different sizes
- menu itself was really pleasing to the eye. i especially loved the way they did the bar menu. 
- corkage fee was $20. crazy cheap for on the strip. do it. though, admittedly the food on the menu deserves cold cocktails or beer. 

cons:
- service was slow...ish... when i'm in vegas i want to always have a cold dirnk in my hand. my server seemed to have missed that memo. there was a delay between my drinks. oh the horror. (i know, first world problems)
- while i enjoyed the style of the front room with it's low club chairs around small side tables, i woudlnt really want to eat anything in those seats. you end up having to hunch forward. i say if you want to eat, get a real table and ditch the bar area. cause, a bar is for drinking. 

would i come again? yes, as i've already been there twice before i was able to write this review :)",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,1,1,4,UAYvHGZAeV921YWydjuoUQ
3757622,2016-10-31,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Honest review. My husband and I chose this restaurant based on the reviews on YELP. Here's what I didn't like:  it was very dark. The decor was confusing. It was very modern styling for touting to be a Southern fare restaurant. Too dark to read the menu without my flashlight on my phone. No Coors light so we ordered Bud Light but the only size they served were huge cans. We split the LewEllen 1/2 chicken and cornbread. The chicken flavor was wonderful but the pieces were small considering the $26 price. The LewEllen plate was chicken only; the bill was nearly 60 bucks for 4 small pieces of chicken and a small pan of cornbread and 2 beers. No salad no sides, those are extra. The waiter was very efficient but almost to the point where it felt more like fast food rather than southern hospitality which is not what we were expecting. The one redeeming quality was the manager stopped by our table as we were waiting for our waiter to pick up our payment. We told him about our experience and he listened intently. He asked to see our bill and told us he would make it right. Soon after he brought our bill back; he gave us the beer compliments of the house and cut the rest of our bill in half.

3758594,2015-06-30,13,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I have to thank Questlove from The Roots for introducing Yardbird during an episode of Parts Unknown with Anthony Bourdain.  The food they had on the show looked really awesome and when I found out that they had a Yardbird in Vegas at The Venetian, it was a no-brainer for me to visit!

Yardbird is located at the space that was formally Pinot Brasserie.  I love how it's the next door neighbor to another favorite restaurant of mine, DB Brasserie.  It's funny because you have these two restaurants that are almost complete opposites of each other with one being a Southern joint and their other being a fancy French place.  But it's always a good thing to have variety!

I made a reservation the night before and it was actually pretty easy for me since I was dining solo.  When I came in they immediately took me to my table.  The place is dimly lit but it was a very lively atmosphere.  The lounge area is pretty nice too.

I decided on having the first cocktail that was on the top of the menu since more than likely it's their signature drink which was their Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade.

Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade -- http://bit.ly/1NcaGms
Made with Buffalo Trace bourbon, blackberry puree, fresh lemon, cardamom & Angostura Bitters
This went well with my meal.  They definitely gave me a good amount of bourbon because I barely tasted the lemonade.

Now onto the food.  I basically ordered everything that I saw Questlove and Anthony Bourdain had on the show:  The Fried Green Tomato BLT, the Deviled Eggs, and the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles.  Yeah, for a solo diner, it was a lot of food!

Fried Green Tomato BLT -- http://bit.ly/1d7jWLD
Pork belly, greens, tomato jam, house-made pimento cheese
I like how my waitress gave me an option to order just one of these.  I really wanted to try this but I knew I wouldn't have room for it since I had ordered their Deviled Eggs, so having a single portion was a great idea.  And it was really good!!   It almost reminded me of the Bacon Wrapped Bacon from Rx Boiler Room.  The fried green tomato was lightly fried and the pork belly was braised perfectly.  

By the way before I continue, I just want to point out that my waitress was awesome!  She always checked up on me, offered cool recommendations,  and also made sure that I wasn't bombarded with food so she had each course come out in a timely manner.

Deviled Eggs -- http://bit.ly/1TD2Xm0
Fresh chive, smoked trout roe 'redneck caviar'
OMGFYUM!  Who would've thought that roe would make a great topping to deviled eggs?  These deviled eggs were magical!  The egg filling was silky smooth and it had a nice explosive salty element with the roe.  I probably could've ordered this twice but I still had a huge chicken and waffle platter coming up.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles -- http://bit.ly/1GpqGfn
Yardbird's signature 'old school fried chicken', honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, cheddar cheese chow chow waffle, bourbon maple syrup
This was my main event which I was thought was a little overwhelming with me eating this all by myself.  In a way, it was almost like another food challenge for me.  This is definitely meant to be shared.  You can pretty much break this down into three meals.  The chicken was solid though.  Very crispy on the outside and juicy inside and it went well with the honey hot sauce.    The Cheddar Chow Chow Waffle was tasty as well, but the bourbon maple syrup didn't work for me so I just ate them plain.  And finally the spiced watermelon was refreshing despite having a little kick.  It made for a great dessert.  .As much as everything was tasting good, I really hit the wall with the waffles and watermelon pieces.  I probably could've finished the whole thing though if I didn't have those appetizers beforehand, especially the Deviled Eggs which really filled me up.

How does Yardbird rank with favorite Fried Chicken in Vegas?  It's well up there, but I still prefer the Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken at Brooklyn Bowl.  But not to take anything away from Yardbird, their Fried Chicken is still worth mentioning to my friends if they're looking for other high end Fried Chicken options on The Strip.

So as you've just read, there definitely was no doubt that I left Yardbird with an overstuffed and satisfied belly.  Sure it's pricey but the quality of their food and service justified it.  I would love to come back again for brunch and also to try their other specialties for lunch and dinner or just for another round of their Fried Chicken.  I'll be looking forward to my next visit!",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,21,21,5,6qtQ3rSMAfZfOE0sF-a_Pg

Vegas people do not know what Southern food should taste like. When I retire, hopefully rental prices won't be too high and I can make a killing!

We started with the deviled eggs. They were delicious-- deliciously dill. Southern deviled eggs usually have Cajun spice. 

We continued with the fried chicken and the sliders. The fried chicken was good, but not nearly the best either of us have tasted. I had a brisket slider and a fried chicken slider. I already commented on the fried chicken. The brisket slider was good, but needed honey in the barbecue sauce. 

The last mistake we made was to order peach cobbler. It was good, but it needed more butter, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and lemon zest. Yes, it needed THAT much help.

No need to do this restaurant again, even though it was a unique experience.

I asked for recommendations from the waiter and he offered up three top choices. I did go ahead and order the chicken plus a Mac & Cheese side. While good, I was a bit disappointed by the chicken; I give it a 3.75-4.0. The portion size was fair and it was cooked well but overall it just missed. The Mac & Cheese was a 3.5, a bit thin and watery. The waiter was very attentive and the service not rushed. They cleared the dishes without prodding and all staff was well trained. I did speak to the manager for a time on my way out and found him to be very approachable and excited about the restaurant. We did not discuss my experience however.

Now on to the food. I ordered the chicken and biscuits. I wasn't sure if I would like the pepper jelly so asked for it on the side. A lot of the patrons were getting the chicken and waffles and I was torn between the two but decided to go with the biscuits. I was so glad that I did. While the meal looks small, both myself and my husband could not eat it all!!! We were only able to eat one chicken biscuit and forced half of the second one! Next time we can probably share one order. But omg! The biscuits are made from scratch and are delicious! The chicken was fried just right. Crispy in certain spots. The pepper jelly was a little spicy but added a nice flavor. I will probably continue to get it on the side so that I can control the amount of spice. For my drink I ordered a blueberry non alcoholic drink. The presentation was so cute. It came in a small mason jar and was very good. My husband had a peach tea and it was good as well.

A gem of a place on the strip. Literally I would never go back to Vegas without revisiting this restaurant. As a main we shared the fried chicken; which was the perfect texture and some of the finest fried chicken this planet has to offer. The only downside to this dish was it did not come with sides. 
As an appetizer we ordered the brisket biscuit (or was it biscuit brisket) which I may have enjoyed more than any food Ive tasted in the past decade. The brisket was so good that we have decided to make ""biscuit brisket"" an everyday phrase.

I will say that the sides were mediocre at best. The mac n cheese was nothing special; the coleslaw is bested by an average diner; the spiced watermelon was...idk it just was. The brisket biscuit was good enough that the lack of decent side dishes was not something that I can remove a star for (or if I did it would be from 6-5 star anyway....)

If your reading this and not going to eat dinner here thats ok. Just make sure to stop by and get some biscuit brisket to make life worth living... ""that sh*t was so good""",mFhV2vi9O0FXCfbtcM0vrA,0,0,5,FqiTg1YsgRsj7m5Xq3jN4g
3796310,2016-10-20,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Wow! I tried Yardbird a few weeks ago for the first time and I was really impressed. If you're in Vegas and looking for some savory Southern food and good drinks, then this is your place. 

After sleeping in on a Saturday morning, I started yelping for places with good brunch. I found this place and I'm so glad I did. I got there in the late morning and was immediately seated at the bar. 

My gf and I decided to order drinks. I got the Yardbird Old Fashioned and she got the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade. Both were great choices. My bourbon was exactly what you look for in an old fashioned: cold, strong, and smooth. The Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade was the type of drink you make your go-to. It was the perfect combination of just great taste with a kick. That's a must order for anyone coming here for the first time.

As far as food, I ordered the omelette of the day, which had bacon and cheese. It comes with a biscuit and fruit. The biscuits are amazing. They might be the best I've ever had. The omelet was on the small side but it was well-made and still filled me up. I've had better. My gf ordered sausage biscuits. It came with two of them and they each had egg and tomatoes. I'm not really a fan of sausage biscuits, but these were just undeniable. I wound up eating about half of hers. Like I said the biscuits themselves are amazing, but the sausage patty was about as good as I've had.

So the food and drinks here along with the place itself made Yardbird worthy of 5 stars in my book, but it was the service that really takes this place over the top. The lady bartender, whose name I don't remember, was really attentive the whole time and super friendly. As far as service though, they did have one slip up: our food took about 25 minutes to come out when it probably shouldn't have based on how few people were there. But they more than made up for it. Beau, who had checked up on my gf and I multiple times, noticed that our food was taking unusually long. He apologized for it and even better, he gave us a pumpkin pie milk shake on the house. The milkshake was as good as it gets. It was exactly what the name suggests and more. The manager even came over to apologize for the wait and ask us what we thought of the shake.

Overall, this place is more than deserving of 5 stars. They are a bit pricey (I spent ~$80 for 2 small meals and 2 drinks), but it is definitely worth it. Three items there stood out to me as being top of the line: the biscuits, the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade, and the pumpkin pie milk shake. It's not often you can name three items from one place as being top quality. The place itself, food, drinks, and service make Yardbird a place I must return to next time I'm in Vegas.

Ok enough silliness.

I first learned about yardbird from my recent visit to Miami. Imagine my excitement when I learned that this amazing restaurant was going to open in Las Vegas.

Going in, i thought back to the fond memories of the original location in Miami.  The basic look is the same however I do feel that the Miami location is much more charming and intimate. Vegas felt a bit corporate and felt like the swankier brother of Miami. That being said I still really enjoyed the ambiance.

Anyway...

I ordered a blackberry bourbon lemonade. It's the same taste as what I remembered. Great job!

When it comes to food at the Vegas location, there are several different choices of entrees which is very different from Miami. That being said, we ordered the ribs which to me reminiscent of Chinese style ribs. Everything else we ordered we the same items from the Miami location. BLT, which is fried green tomato, pork belly, frisée, and pimento cheese. Nailed it!  Also had chicken and biscuits and fried pickles. All amazing and on point. Nice to see that Vegas was so consistent with their executions. We ordered the bourbon pecan butterscotch cake. Monster piece of cake. I only wish that the cake was served a bit warmer. I can tell it was from the fridge and had not sit enough to bring it to room temperature. 

We came back for our last meal before we had to go home as well. Had lunch. Ordered the blue plate special which was a great value. So good.

Overall, if you like southern food, you are in the right place. Good place to eat in groups. Wonderful alcohol selection. Spectacular execution and good service.

3834331,2017-10-25,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I'm going to combine two sperate experiences I had in the same day into one review. We first walked into Yardbird to meet up with some friends after attending a convention. Upon walking in I was instantly impressed with their decorè. I am a huge fan of restaurants that make you feel like you walked into a completely different era or country. Onto their menu... the menu is a bit underwhelming as far as food options go if you are gluten free or vegetarian (me) but it was great for our group who all happen to enjoy flour and meat. When our server approached us she immediately went to clean the table rather than saying something along the lines of ""excuse me let me get this out of your way."" We also had to ASK for a menu rather than being handed one. When we were finally asked if we wanted something to drink, we responded that we wanted something non-alcoholic but she didn't list all the options and seemed irritated. I went ahead and asked if they had lemonade and luckily they did and they muddle the fruit and squeeze the lemonade fresh, so I was instantly sold. She then came back with my drink, and forgot my boyfriends; left and returned to tell us there is last call for food so we would have to order now - without clarification on why the restaurant would be closing hours earlier than listed on Yelp. I went ahead and inquired and she said ""I'm not sure when but we have a private event and I was told its last call now for food and drinks"" When I asked what time we would need to leave by she didn't know and would find out, but do we want to order? I went with their warm cheese and watermelon appetizer since I wasn't too hungry and the pictures of the salads on Yelp were underwhelming for the price. My boyfriend ordered the burger and mac and cheese as a side. Unfortunately the watermelon was so thin and light it wasn't rebought to even satisfy my moderately hungry stomach and it was too late to order anything in addition and we needed to ""rush"" to finish in time before getting kicked out for the close. Personally I think that anyone who shows up two hours before a buy out should be notified. Some of us like to sit, enjoy and communicate while we eat and drink, not rush through food in under an hour. Needless to say I left very displeased after this first visit. 

Second visit. 

Only a few hours later we stopped back in for the private event after hearing that a group of our new friends from the convention would be attending. I was not looking to drink but since there wasn't table service we went to the bar to grab something refreshing. I decided to go for a tea and was pleasently surprised that the bar back left the bar to the kitchen to fetch me this lovely tea kettle hot tea and entire box of tea bags to choose from. They also brought the kettle out with honey and a variety of sweeteners. 

Pros: 

-Ambiance 
-Unique Menu 
-Amazing Tea 
-Fresh Blackberry Lemonade 
-Great bar staff customer service even those who weren't drinking alcohol

Cons: 

-Limited gluten free options
-Poor server customer service
-Not enough notice that they were closing early 

All in all I would come back for the appetizers and tea but it's not likely that I would choose to eat here since there aren't many options for me and their salads didn't look appealing from the photos.",9SiaKMfoX7hsWxqNd-CKaw,1,3,4,Ouf9HdLoeXWNLKGNNit0Gg

The restaurant itself is really chic and cute, with a rustic look. Their lights were made with hanging Mason Jars. It was very cute. 

We ordered our food family style so that came with two large servings of the chicken, and we ordered extra sides too. We also ordered extra biscuits which came with this amazing apple jam and the biscuits were served hot and fresh! We also had a mac n cheese side along with french fries. The mac n cheese was my other favorite side. I definitely recommend the mac n cheese!

The french fries were also good and crisp, but there wasn't anything particularly special about them. We also ordered a side of deviled eggs. They were plated very nicely and tasted just as good. The best part is probably the chicken. The chicken was battered and deep fried perfectly. I really like the seasoning because it was flavorful and has a kick to it. 

They also give you a lot of hot sauce and other sauces on the side to drench your chicken in! Their hot sauce is a MUST!

I heard about Yard Bird from a friend who recently ate at the one in Miami. He highly recommended that I try it and I am so happy that I did. 

We started out with the house Bloody Mary. Jalapeño infused vodka is what makes this one special, it's spicy, but not too spicy. Served in a mason jar and garnished with a lime, stuffed olive, picked green bean, pickled okra and a slice of bacon. It was a delicious mini meal in itself. 

For appetizers we tried the fried green tomato BLT and the deviled eggs. Both were delicious!  Really enjoyed the BLT! 

For the main course I had the blue plate special which is two pieces of fried chicken (probably the best I have ever had) watermelon and a biscuit. Oh that chicken is good! So tender it almost falls off the bone. 

My friends had the crunchy chicken sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich. They too loved what they ordered and said they would order it again!  

We skipped dessert, but there were some pretty great looking treats on the menu. I will be sure to try one next time.

I like the upbeat vibe of the place. Seating is what I call ""community style"", so, if you're searching for an intimate dining experience, this is not it. You'll likely be seated side by side with your neighbor.

Service was okay until my server Tanya D got smart. Someone other then Tanya served my chicken and waffle. She was busy serving other surrounding tables, so, it took some time before she came back to check on me. When she finally made her way back to my table, I politely inquired as to whether the waffle was supposed to be served cold. Her immediate response - ""well, it WAS served a while ago!"" I knew by her sarcastic remark that we weren't going to get anywhere with this. I just smiled and said ""that's ok, no problem."" She must've sensed her inappropriate attitude and response because minutes later she reappeared at my table stating that a fresh new waffle was being made. Said the chef explained that it could've been cold due to the cheddar cheese. That's fine Tanya, but the slick comment you made was rude and uncalled for. You could've just offered an apology and offered to bring a fresh hot waffle in the first place. I explained that a new waffle was not necessary because I would not be able to eat it. I noted that I heard what she had to say in her original response to me stating my waffle was cold. Once again, she managed to get smart. Her response, ""Well, one is being brought to you anyway!"" At this point, I was ready to bounce. The chicken was good, but this chick was really putting a damper on my dining experience.

3865010,2017-07-12,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird. It says it in the name - bird. They stand behind their chicken and with good reason, it's damn good. 

We started out sharing the kale salad with smoked chicken. Made with tender baby kale leaves tossed in a light vinaigrette with moonshine soaked raisins and topped with sour granny smith apples and the best corn bread croutons, each bite had a varying of textures and flavors. With each bite there was some smokiness from the chicken with the tangy dressing and the sourness from the apples and slight sweetness from the raisins. 

If it's one thing that I have learned from eating at Southern places, it's that portions are anything but small - so we decided that we would would share. Called it, when the Bird came out we knew we had made the right decision. This dish came with exactly half a chicken that had been breaded in a savory crunchy coating and deep fried to perfection. Accompanying the chicken was a honey hot sauce and a cheddar waffle, bourbon infused maple syrup and some watermelon that had been chilled and infused in spices.
 
Ok, I will be the first to admit that I was planning to just chow down on the chicken and ignore the rest - but I am sure glad I didn't. 

The chicken definitely pairs better with the  honey hot sauce (honestly I couldn't taste the honey - tasted like plain hot sauce to me) but I accidentally dipped my chicken in the maple syrup and my life changed. I can honestly say that before today I was never a fan of chicken and waffles, that mix of sweet and meaty savory did not sound appealing. But Yardbird has changed my perspective. 

The waffles are something else. Usually when you think waffles, you think dense (ok not dense dense but a heavier cake) and sweet. These waffles were lighter and because it was topped with cheddar has a slight crisp to them - a crisp that remained throughout the meal. The waffle was layered, the bottom was sweet but the top was slightly savory from the cheese. All of these was absolutely delicious doused in their maple syrup. 

It's worth mentioning that there are two types of maple syrup available - there is the bourbon infused maple syrup and the traditional. Not being a fan whatsoever of alcohol I wanted to avoid the bourbon infused altogether but hubby encouraged me to have a taste. It wasn't anything like I expected, it had a nice bite to it - almost an oaky after taste. 

The infused chilled watermelon slices were quite interesting. They had a slight kick to them and were the perfect light crisp end to a heavier meal.

If you're looking for a filling meal at a decent price, Yardbird is a must. 

A few things to note:
- There is likely going to be some sort of wait regardless of what time you go, leave your number with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready.

3875644,2015-06-11,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"3.5 stars but I'll round it up to 4 because I think the food deserves it. I can best describe this resto as being a nice little upscale southern spot located in the Venetian. Definitely a place for special occasions if you're into Southern food. Thankfully a friend of mine treated me here because I was hosting him for a bit over the weekend and felt that it was necessary to do so. 

Fried Green Tomato BLT- there was definitely a lot going on here compared to your traditional fried green tomatoes, but I assume that should be expected since everything in it was in the description. The pork belly was perfectly done and cheese pimento combine the 2 major components (pork and tomato) nicely. There was also a jam at the bottom of the tomato between the place and that made it a bit much with too many flavors going on. To top it off there was some type of greens, which added height. Although this was a very busy appetizer, my friend and I both agreed this was our favorite part of the meal.

Salisbury steak- we enjoyed this dish as well. The mushrooms, shallots and gravy was delicious- to the point that they out-shined the steak itself. The steak was very ordinary, nothing special almost homemade like at your Aunt's house or something but I guess that what the other components was for. 

Sides- biscuits, mac n cheese, and corn bread. The biscuits was very upscale flakey and were delish. I loved dipping this into the gravy of our main entree. This also came with honey butter and jam. The honey butter was good, but not as mind blowing as other southern places I've tried. Mac n cheese was a solid dish as well, which came in a mini cast iron. The corn bread was pretty moist from what I remember. 

All in all the food here is a step of from your typical Southern food, but safe at the same time... I don't know if that makes sense, but if you eat here you'll know what I'm talking about. The service was of course impeccable, which is expected for a restaurant at this price point. Honestly, the food here was $3-$5 priced more than it should actually be. I'm a local so I can complain about that, but my friend who was a tourist said it's ""strip prices"" which is absolutely true. Although I enjoyed my overall experience here, I don't think I'll be coming again because it's a bit much for my budget.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,1,1,4,rL2zxTZRyXKq-JMaPX-WVA

Chicken and waffle was way overpriced for what it was. It was just fried chicken and one waffle. Nothing exciting about the flavoring or anything of the fried chicken. The syrup was a nice touch but not worth the $36 for fried chicken and a waffle. 

The menu is very small for a brunch menu. Not a lot of options.

She was very reluctant to bring us the dinner menu and when she did told us the only thing we could order off it was the burger ( it was 1 in the afternoon not 9 in the morning) but then we continued to see sandwiches and other dinner items come out of the kitchen while waiting for our food. The poached egg dish had a very odd overpowering lemon flavor to the sauce that ruined the whole dish. The burger was super greasy. 

We ordered the peach cobbler instantly cause we had friends tell us it was fantastic (again nothing overly special) and still ended up waiting for it forever after our meal.  

Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's better for the cocktails!",Jw3E6yEFng_hJUsiYwQfkQ,0,0,3,m6FGAXN6B0xcRSSllh1ItQ

We just stumbled upon this place while walking around the Venetian, so we decided to stop in for lunch. We got great service, and the you can see right into the kitchen (which I always appreciate).

The place has a southern style, and their specialty is fried chicken. Most of us got the friend chicken sandwich, and it was really good. You definitely get a lot of chicken on the sandwich, and you can order it with french fries or a side salad (for no extra $).

The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because it is a little pricey. We got mimosas and they were $13 each, which I guess can be expected when you're drinking on the strip. I would eat here again next time I'm in Las Vegas.",MF0Ak6JSd3ODwEL6nNNAxw,0,0,4,iVYtJPNw3TYdP9EUgdc_lg

Lol . Yardbird was packed on a Saturday night! They said they were ""fully committed"" in seating so reservations are likely preferable. They also have a sofa area or the bar where they serve full menu, so those are first come first serve. We didn't wanna be seated at a sofa and be hunched over while we ate, so we opted for the bar! The woman serving us was no nonsense. Obviously she was doing other tasks but we felt kinda rushed as she served on us. I'm not knocking any stars for that though. The food was good! We decided on the burger ($18) and the short ribs ($32). The prices were norm for Vegas but I think a near $20 for a burger is ...c'mon. Lol . We really enjoyed both though. Just beyond what I like to pay :p 

A lot of diners sitting near us ordered the Cornbread- it looks so delicious!!!! We were pretty full but I'd definitely order this in the future.",1FEoQIJw2qd2baTlZNRcEg,1,0,4,cm-FPhHuwzmWVQAyXHy14Q
3897146,2017-02-27,8,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"We were sucked in by the recent Hell's Kitchen competition and set a lunch date to experience Yardbird. I was double confident with my Yelp peeps nearly perfect stars, so confident I invited guests to join us and raved about how great this place is said to be. Ugh! Where
Do I even begin! 
1) showed up and told we had no reservations and perhaps I made them for their MIA location? Party of 5 no reservation. Asked the hostess if I could put our name in and was told wait was over an hour but we could find a seat in the lounge. Let me say that again ASKED to put my name down and hostess said find a seat in the lounge. She did not take my name. 
2) We found an dirty table that still needed busing but it accommodated us awkwardly. Within 5minutes area was cleaned but it took longer to get menus or service. We weren't in a rush so that's okay but just not expected from such a place. 
3) food order taken we started with deviled eggs and Mac n cheese. Solid nothing above basic. Food comes out and our small table still has our dirty appetizer dishes and Un-filled water glasses on the table. Hubby is now peeved. 
4) food was not at all what the southern story of the owner describes. The chicken although was juicy and tender it was bland in flavor and my 3 squares of salted watermelon were really good but seriously, 1 inch 3 bites? That's it. THe brisket was over sauced, drenched in BBQ sauce and my husband only ate 1/2. Mango salad on butter lettuce with grilled chicken was exactly that. The only dish that was worth an honorable mention was the slow roasted chicken salad that had this delicious sweet corn bread in it. 
5) I ordered a $5 sweet tea with my meal and it was really good! Served in a mason jar for that southern feel, I liked that. However, never asked if I needed a refill or wanted to order another. Out comes the check and I had to ask the server if the tea included a refill or could I order another? Her reply, "" oh, yeah..."" walks away. Ummmm, ok. I get the refill she takes the bill. We pay we leave. 
Moral of the review: 
A 2 stars ""I've had better, been treated better"" review. As Gordon Ramsey would say, "" Un ( insert F word) Believable! 
There are wayyyyyy too many choices for chicken in Vegas than to ever put up with over pretentious, over-priced, underwhelming chicken.

The staff was hospitable, the manager came by the table (several times) and pointed out food on the line to help us decide. What an interactive experience!! We ordered the deviled eggs and the fried green tomatoes to start. There were five of us and she just made it easy by bringing one piece for each of us. This simple thing spoke to the ease of the experience we had there. We didn't have to think for them. We all tried drinks that we never would have and stop the car for the at least five different kinds of ice. The unpretentious attention to detail didn't stop!

DO NOT miss the 21 hour brined deep fried chicken with waffles and what else? Watermelon!  The watermelon had chili powder, mint and salt- try it you will love it. The chicken comes with a honey hot sauce and there's maple syrup for the waffles.  Don't miss the super tender short ribs with cauliflower mashed potatoes, kind of wish it wasn't in a bowl because you had to put your fork on the table.

Yep and there's grits, wish we had tried the biscuits and god I would go back to Vegas just to eat here.

Make reservations, it's hip, comfortable, bourbon cocktail filled and full of darn right good cookin.

My suggestion.... go to KFC, get the original recipe and add some chives and black pepper it is the same thing!   The ham Sandwich nothing more than store bought ham on a KFC biscuit.   The Trout Eggs added salt to the boring deviled eggs... again, a pinch of table salt..  would do the same thing.   Total bill should have been about $35, and that would be pricey.

This place was/is an embarrassment for the likes of the Venetian.

Service: Can I do 20 stars? Hatch, our server, was incredible! Just the right amount of everything. Great personality, super knowledgeable, visited the table exactly the right amount. We had to hug him when we left because we instantly loved him. And the manager came to hang out with us and tell us the history of the place when we asked for him in order to convey our adoration for our server. It was a fabulous experience.

Food: We ordered one of everything that looked good on the menu, and all 4 of us ended up rolling out the door totally stuffed and groaning in ecstasy.

First, our less favorite items:
Warm Farmer's Cheese: It was good, but not to die for. And with all the other totally incredible items, I almost forgot about it.
Heirloom Tomatoes with ricotta cheese: Again, tasty, but nothing incredible. A little too much salt on the tomatoes considering the bed of ricotta which is also salty.

Okay, here's the amazing stuff:
Buttermilk Biscuits with Ham and Brisket: All the flavor in the world, amazing and delicious. I even stole a bite from my husband when he wasn't looking because I couldn't get enough.
Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad: The perfect amount of everything. Grilled mango is my new favorite fruit.
Iceberg Wedge: Incredible bacon and avocado on this salad. The name sounds boring, but it was so good we actually cleaned the plate dipping the BBQ chicken in the small amount of dressing left.
Smoked Backyard BBQ Chicken: The chicken was a little dry (smoked, not baked, so totally expected) and was perfectly flavored. The charred okra was so tasty and perfectly done (it's too easy to screw up okra)
Cornbread with jalapeno: Not spicy at all, just a hint of the pepper flavor without the bite. Went perfectly with everything.

Bottom lines: 
Don't be a vegetarian at this restaurant, you'll be missing out. They do meat, salad, and biscuits the *right* way. 
Order all the things that look good, you won't regret it.
Trust your server to recommend the best beverages. We each got boozy drinks, and he was spot on with his recommendations.
This is one of the least expensive, best food, best service places my husband and I have ever been to. If in doubt, just try it.",UhA2RpthyP7sklJiEnMlyA,0,0,5,LjMi0Hb7e-sPnmwQYtwElA
3905695,2017-03-20,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird Southern Table and Bar was one of the best surprises we had for our Vegas trip. We discovered Yardbird simply because my friend was craving fried chicken and we saw their poster in Venetian. That's it, just one picture of their amazing fried chicken with waffles led us to their restaurant and officially discovered one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. Yardbird serves Southern comfort food, from homemade biscuit, fried chicken to shrimps and grits. All your classic Southern cravings can be fulfilled here. The restaurant is modernly designed country farm house. I love the wood tables, industrial lighting, and heavy wood frames around the restaurant. It's a very spacious restaurant, another point that really reminds me of Southern states. 

We started out with drinks. They have an impressive selections of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Definitely, I couldn't resist their Southern sweet tea but had to do half and half to tone down the sweetness. OMG, I loved the sweet tea! It brought me back to Texas hot summers! Perfect amount of sweet, ice, and tea flavor in my mouth. I finished the first glass in like 10 minutes. The waiter/waitress refilled my glass quickly. I appreciate the service was friendly, attentive, and professional. 

Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad - excellent refreshing salad with fresh high quality butter lettuce, lightly dressed with sesame seed dressing. The smoked pecans was just perfect with the dressing. Grilled mango didn't provide too much of flavor because it was very sweet or very grilled. I think the dish could be better with sweeter mango. Excellent salad, just hit the spot for me.

Mama's biscuit with crispy chicken (2 served) - oh my, oh my, oh my! Their buttermilk biscuit was amazing. You can't resist the flaky, freshly baked, honey butter biscuit. I loved it! It gets better when I got to their crispy fried chicken!!! It was sold after just one bite. The chicken was well seasoned and fried. I love the Southern crispy breading of the chicken along with sweet honey and pepper jelly. Oh yes, it was absolutely perfect. With a touch of their honey hot sauce, this dish was one of the best we had in Vegas! On the side, they served with house-made pickled cucumber and onions. Perfect to balance out the greasy fried chicken and buttery biscuit. I couldn't ask for more. The serving was perfect for 1 person and it's only $14! Excellent deal! 

A friend of mine ordered their Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles, which was another wonder dish. The homemade honey hot sauce was absolutely fantastic with their fried chicken. The waffle and syrup were also great. The watermelon was a beautiful touch to make your taste buds fresh for every bite of chicken.

Overall, we had a 5-star experience along with their excellent food, service, and ambiance. I will absolutely come back again when I visit Las Vegas. It is now in my ""must-go"" Las Vegas restaurant list.",_LO6FEx4GtkDE2Fzp9NejA,4,1,5,UotQi9AvlgU3UFblG25L8A
3905939,2015-06-12,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Every time I visit Vegas with my mom and sister, we always love to eat at new restaurants.  I feel we have tried some of ""the greats"" from Gordon Ramsay Steak (and his Pub), Nobu, Giada,  to other joints all around the strip.  This trip, we stayed at the Venetian and took advantage of some of the restaurants within, so there stood Yardbird southern Table and Bar and the menu caught our eye right off the bat. When you tell me that this restaurant is a James Beard semifinalist, picked by BonApetit as the best restaurant of 2012 and continues to receive good reviews, I am there, especially when I see grits or fried chicken and waffles.  Welcome to a new, unexpected Vegas dining experience, which by the way, was my FAVORITE Vegas eat during our five days! 
We came in a little early to have a drink at the bar.  Now I am not a bourbon girl, but my mom is, and she drank the blackberry bourbon lemonade and loved it. Then she has some Jefferson bourbon and water and was in heaven.  If you like bourbon, this is your bar!  Good beer selection.  I had a local IPA and it was hoppliy delicious.  
I was noticing the ambiance of the place. Lots of groups of people just enjoying the casual environment-lots of men, but I do think many women would look at this place and turn their nose up seeing that it is more southern typed food which already has a stigma of unhealthy, greasy, what have you,  but people just need to try it because it is not your typical southern cooking. There is something for everyone. This a great restaurant for foodies, groups, couples and anyone who appreciates good eating, a nice, rustic ambiance and having a restaurant that is unlike any other in Vegas; you MUST try it for yourself.  I love the decor.  Cool industrial lighting with a modern edge; Everything is stylish but has little farm twists in the details.  Everyone, from our bartenders, to Greg (who I believe is one of the managers and who took some time to tell us about what he recommended, which we took full advantage of once we began ordering) to our waiter, was super friendly, helpful and courteous.  
To start, we ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT  and the smoked, roasted bone marrow for appetizer. First, I DO NOT like tomatoes at all unless they are pureed finely for a sauce.  But the BLT was magnificent and I didn't want to stop eating it.  My family makes fried green tomatoes, but this was not your average fried green tomato; this one has a perfect crust topped with the tomato jam, and the house-made pimento cheese( which I am also not regularly a fan of ) then a thick slab of pork belly (which might be a perfect food) and frisee lettuce- it was luscious and I know people will come to the restaurant just to eat this.  Great flavor and balance-loved it! 
But the roasted bone marrow was unbelievable and when the manager asked what I thought, I believe I said something else-sub in an expletive in my adjective-ha ha! He laughed...sometimes that is a perfect word for food that just is perfect. I digress.  Now, I too have never ate bone marrow, and my sister DOES NOT EAT meat off or from a bone, but she indulged and she loved it-the look on her face was priceless-she enjoyed it. You just scrape it out of the bone,  and spread it on grilled bread and it was hands down one of the best things I have ever ate-truly.  I highly recommend this as an appetizer because it was rich, buttery, sort of inexplicable, but a food that I will have again and will think about in terms of the top foods I have eaten.
My mom and I shared the fried chicken and waffles, with spiced watermelon and we got a side of the charred okra with cojita cheese and my sister has their flatiron steak.  It was the best fried chicken I have ever had, and I feel I have tried a lot.  Since they brine the chicken for over 24 hours, it was the tenderest, juiciest meat I have had hands down.  It was not greasy, but just so good-even the 2 couples next to me finished every bite; I literally could not stop eating.  My favorite though was the honey hot sauce.  I couldn't get enough-great accompaniment for the chicken.  The waffles were great with the bourbon syrup and I again, don't care for bourbon.  Even my sister, who I had mentioned will not touch meat on a bone, tried the chicken and even she agreed that it was delicious.  My sister ate every bite of her steak; the biscuits were homemade and wonderfully sweet.  The okra was amazing and I have only had fried okra and this was something I would like to make.  What was cool is the table down from us asked if the chef could make fried okra and he did-pretty cool.  Then we had, to our own gluttony, had the bacon butterscoth cake.  Out of this world-too big even to share-had never eaten bacon frosting; pecan filling, bourbon ice cream.  We were deeply satisfied, full, and just LOVED IT! 

My only regret was not being able to try their brunch.  I will go back again and again and I will be telling people about it back home that this is a gem!",LtzEKvPtHT-lUtJwZGbKCg,0,0,5,tfXS7Lmrux34zGo68Mcaxg

The reason we came here was actually due to words of mouth. The words on the D.C. street last summer among some foodies was to check out Yardbird when in Vegas, some made sure I remember to come here upon hearing about my trip. 

We got a table last minute and were sat right across from the kitchen (YAY for my obsession of seeing the kitchen action!)

The service was GREAT! Staff was very attentive, from door to table. Even the chef (thank you Chef Stephen Austin). Chef Austin was busy making sure everything was done correctly and smoothly, but he also stopped by to check on us when he got a chance, and explained some dishes, and made additional recommendations of some must try items that we omitted. Of course, we ordered some more food based on his recommendation and we did not regret the decision :)

We ordred a lot, including fried green tomato BLT (chef's recommendation), mac & cheese, warm farmers' cheese and watermelon, roasted cauliflower w/ capers and pumpkin seeds, green beans, kale salad with cornbread crouton (says what?), iceberg wedge, chicken n watermelon n waffle, fried chicken, and blistered tomato with ricotta and chili oil (which I don't think is on the current menu) and ended with some desserts including red velvet cheesecake and lots of berries. 

LOVED EVERYTHING, but the ones I think are must are the farmers cheese and watermelon, and fried chicken (or any sorts, with or without waffles), and kale salad (that CORNBREAD CROUTON?!). I'm not a huge lover for southern food, but I seriously enjoyed every single bite.

Whatever the restaurant was doing last year, please keep doing it. I'll be coming back next time I'm in town!!",hdbSw_DTCwm-78tcEPxmgg,4,3,5,Uw0u1a-gQSUN1N9cwy-Ofg

The Benedict was fabulous, chunks of pork belly that I'm still thinking about. The biscuit was lovely and each element being delicious and well crafted.

I'm not one to order fried chicken all that often but the tastes I had were that beautiful combo of crunchy, moist, juicy, flavorful, savory and just damn good.

They are known for their fried chicken, and it did not disappoint. You can tell it's brined for some serious amount of time, because it might have been the juiciest fried chicken I have ever had. The wife and I split the brussels sprouts and mac & cheese side along with the chicken dinner, and it was definitely enough food for the two of us. Service was great, decor fantastic, and 5 star food. Hard to beat for a meal in Vegas.

3931193,2018-06-23,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"UPDATE: So we came back at the request of the General Manager Steve and the Assistant General Manager Scott.  First of all, I think it is amazing that the General Managers work the floor alongside their team to serve and speak to patrons! That speaks volumes to the culture as this franchise expands. Now on to my updated food review. Once again the biscuits and kale salad were awesome. This time I ordered the Southern Peach tea cocktail. I have to say it was good and packed a punch. This time we started with the Mac n cheese (which we were informed was voted the best in the state of Nevada)... um , yes, it really was that good! My hubby was convinced by Scott to try the chicken again; reluctantly he did and was quite happy. This time hubby ordered the Ham and Eggs and was pleased with his meal. All in all, we had a phenomenal experience at Yardbird in Vegas and will visit the one in The Beverly Center when we are back in LA. Scott will be managing that one in the next few weeks, so I know it will be top-notch.

Original review: It makes me sad to write this review, but let me start with the good. There was a 10 min wait for the restaurant and so we went to the bar and I ordered a drink. Thanks to the bartender's recommendation, I had a sparkling Rose and it gave me joy. After looking over the menu and talking to her, we decided to just eat at the bar. We started with deviled eggs, which were really good. Highly recommended! Then I ordered the Kale Salad and my Husband ordered their friend chicken and we ordered a basket of biscuits. My salad was absolutely yummy and those biscuits were seriously top notch (and my grandmother is from the south... enough said...). So up until all of that, Yardbird got 5 Stars.... But the fried chicken... my hubby said it had good flavor, but there was a part of it that seemed a little under-cooked, so he didn't eat that part and ate the rest. He didn't think much of it.... soon after his stomach was a mess and unfortunately let's just say he has seen more of the bathroom than Vegas and the last 20 hours.... for that Yardbird gets 1 star. So this all balances out to 3 stars. My advice... if the chicken doesn't seem fully cooked, send it back! I would hate for anyone to go through what my husband is still going through today at 4p from a dinner we had last night at 9p.

I got the Low + Slow Smoked Chicken Salad! Didn't know what to expect and really enjoyed all the different textures. A nice sweetness and crunchy bite from the fried cornbread and the chicken was flavorful. 

The table, of course, shared the infamous fried chicken and peach cobbler (which takes 30 min. to make so order early). The fried chicken just fell off the bone! Would have wanted a crunchier crust, but all is forgiven with that sauce! The peach cobbler was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of cobbler in general, so I really enjoyed the ice cream, little churro lookin stick, and the sugary confection the ice cream was sittin in.

The mac n' cheese was delicious, The fried chicken is obviously amazing, the short rib was great and they have really good drinks. We came here with a large group of girls and no reservations, but walked in later in the evening (around 9pm) and were seated right away. The service was excellent and timing of all of the dishes was great.
The plates are meant to be shared so we were able to order a bunch of things and try a little of everything. We also had these brussel sprouts that were done so well- we honestly didn't have a bad thing. 
I imagine if you actually live in the south you'd be critical of this place, but it was a really nice dinner. It is still nice enough for Vegas, but not so fancy that you feel out of place if you are looking for a semi-casual dinner before going out.

3933611,2018-01-04,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Like nearly every restaurant on the strip, Yardbird is in a Casino (The Venetian in this case) so getting there isn't as straightforward as it would be otherwise. Also like just about anything in Vegas, Yardbird has other locations but I wouldn't necessarily call this a chain as they only have 3 locations outside of this one (Miami, Beverly Hills, & Singapore). The restaurant has some serious accolades as being a James Beard nominated best new restaurant, being a top 50 best new restaurants from Bon Appetit, and getting praise from Southern Living magazine for their fried chicken. 

The restaurant in my opinion is perfect in every way. The ambiance is spacious, classy yet rustic, they have an fairly open kitchen, and service is excellent. The food is flawless and is well portioned. Prices are a bit high but is still fairly reasonable for Vegas standards. I came here with a group of 6 people and we enjoyed our meal so much we came back the next day for a repeat. 

Among our favorites are their classic buttermilk biscuits ($7 for 4 served with honey butter and house-made jam), their standard fried chicken ($26 for 1/2 a chicken), their mac & cheese ($10), and crispy brussel sprouts ($10).

We came to Yardbird and sat at the bar since it was so busy. I got my night started with a beer flight consisting of mostly ales. My date had the Deviled Eggs which were made with dill, chive and smoked trout roe. She said there was almost ""too much Devil"" in the egg. For dinner I had the Smoked Brisket Biscuit, which comes with 2 served with pickled onion & cucumber smoky tomato jam, house-made bbq sauce. They were really, really good. My date had Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken which is just 1/2 a chicken served with honey hot sauce. Their chicken was SO GOOD, but not worth $26.00. They trippin'. We also got a side of Macaroni & Cheese which was torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses all under a crispy herb crust. Now THAT was good. My friend next to us had the legendary Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles served with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon a Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle and bourbon maple syrup. It's the same chicken my date had, but that waffle was good. Again, not worth the money. Overpriced in my opinion simply because the restaurant is inside the Venetian/Palazzo.

First, the host's up front was short with us and seemed over worked. She told us the wait time was 1 hour to 45 min. I tried to clarify as it sounded like she said an 1 hour and 45 mins but she was too dead to respond to me. She did give us a option to sit in the lounge area if there is any available seats which there wasnt so we walked around. After we walked around the casino we returned to the restaurant. 
  We checked in with the host's again where she was like zombie and said nothing to us. We found an open seat in the lounge so we took a seat. After we sat down it took awhile to get a menu; we did ask a waitress for one who said ""she's coming around""....kind of rude. Our waitress dropped off some menus and didnt say much but asked if we wanted water or drinks. My friend ask for 2 waters with lemons. While waiting for the waters we looked at the menu and only saw brunch items which was a little werid because it was 230 pm on a Monday. Upon receiving our waters our waitress asked if we would like anything from the menu. We ask if there was another menu with more lunch options and she explained that they are only using the brunch menu but we can get a burger that's not on the menu, werid but okay. My friend noticed there weren't any lemons in our waters, not a huge deal but we are at upscale restaurant and we plan on spending lot on a good meal there. My friend asked nicely for lemons which our waitress said no problem. During the time of waiting for our lemons which was awhile, we made a decision to leave. 
  Bottom line this restaurant is expensive which is fine but I expected to be treated with good service which did not happen from the very beginning.

3996700,2015-01-25,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I came during CES, right after this opened and really loved this place. I ate at Nobu, Bouchon during my trip to Vegas, and this was the highlight of my meals. I'm super happy we stumbled across this place. Amidst all the steakhouses and Italian trattorias, something like Yardbird was sorely missing from the Vegas restaurant scene.

It's hard to find good Southern food in most places, and this place does not carry the price tags of the South. It is expensive - you're looking at $6-$15 for an appetizer / salad, and ~$30 for main plate, and $8-10 for a side. But it's Vegas, so to be expected; you don't normally come to Vegas to save money.

We were a party of 4 and we shared a bunch of things so that we could try a little bit of everything, which I highly recommend.

Fried Green Tomatoes BLT ($14) - Pork belly with the perfect amount of fat and perfectly crisped, and delicately fried tomatoes. It comes with 3 pieces, so portion it out  or order appropriately. I ate half of one but could have probably eaten 1-2 alone - it was that good.

Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad ($14) - This was good, but not outstanding for me. The butter lettuce was delicate and fresh, and the candied smoked pecans were a nice touch. But I could probably make this at home and the portion was not very big. I felt like i ate 3 pieces of lettuce when we shared this dish. If you want to feel ""healthier"" and get salad, this tastes good, but I don't think I would get it again.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles ($36) - Probably the most expensive fried chicken I've had in my life. 4 pieces of fried chicken - delicious, juicy, and not overly battered, 4 pieces of spiced watermelon (could have done without, but interesting), and a cheddar waffle which was delicious.

All in all, a very delicious meal that came out to about $25 per person after tip & tax. I would love to come back here for brunch, as they had brunch items that looked even better than the dinner. (if you come for lunch, you will get the dinner menu, it's a bit confusing). Cute ambiance, not overly crowded or stuffy, with a trendy and fun vibe. Great service and something different than what you normally find in all the resorts.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,1,2,5,XQVESNyXp0eXq8waSnuVtg

Also, I suspect they were pre-made and had been sitting in an oven somewhere in back waiting for a diner like me to order them. Do not recommend them. The chicken and waffles looked good sitting on other people's tables. Perhaps try those (though they are overpriced--even by Vegas standards).

Food: pretty amazing...got the Chicken & waffles with watermelon  , slow and low chicken salad which had fried cornbread and avocados in it, & the special of the day: biscuits and gravy with eggs & bacon. All were delicious! The chicken was delightfully crispy but very tender and juicy (even the breast), and the watermelon cubes were not only refreshing but very tasty! Served with bourbon maple syrup and hot sauce on the side. The low and slow chicken salad was very good too, with shredded chicken was also very tender with a mild smokey flavor which was well complemented by the fried cornbread, avocados, and buttermilk ranch. The biscuits and gravy-can't say it was the best biscuits and gravy I've had...it's more like a Benedict but with a brown colored thick gravy on 4 halves of biscuits underneath, bacon, and a pouched egg-very brunch like and very good. 
The dinner was finished off with a  complimentary dessert....an amazing cinnamon latte ice cream atop a layer of pumpkin bread served in a cute little mason jar in celebration of Christmas!

Venue: great ambiance with a wide display of wine on the wall. Great service!

Price: $36 for the chicken and waffles dish, $ 14 ish for the salad, and $18 for the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon dish.",qDDQZJBxp08tZb5MYqmFig,1,0,5,f4km4vc9eRcyzsls4puVxA

The fried chicken is good, but I don't know if it lived up to the hype. I think we came in expecting mind-blowing fried chicken, but then realized there is no such thing, because at the end of the day there is only so much you can do to fried chicken. It was about $35 for a plate which two people can share if 1 person has a light appetite. Not cheap by any means.

Cocktails were great. Service was amazing. Felt very welcomed there. Someone who appeared to be a manager even stopped by to ask us how it was.

Overall, while the fried chicken might not blow your socks off, the vibe of this restaurant is just very enjoyable. From the service to the upscale southern theme they have going, it feels like you're walking into an establishment that is managed by people who are very proud of southern food. Definitely a place to check out if you love the experience of food, but most definitely not for the extremely price-conscious crowd.",yY36C-WyVUCFIhwUJA1Ufw,1,0,4,-zNthlPxXEZQHrIsdl3rNw

The toasted goat cheese just melted wonderfully in the mouth and paired with the watermelon was just the perfect compliment.  We had the farm salad which was decent, not a must order next time.  The entree was the fried chicken and waffles which was an absolute delight!  Every bit was perfect!  We had the mashed white sweet potatoes which were the best potatoes I've had in the states.  These potatoes tasted just like the ones I had in Zambia and have been looking here for awhile now.  Lighter and less heavier than the regular sweet potatoes we get. For dessert we had the fried Oreos.  They were battered with Rice Krispies!  I seriously didn't have any room for dessert but I had to get them.  The drinks we had were superb as well.

I'm leary of ordering fried chicken in an actual restaurant... usually ends up tasting like Popeye's & that's not what I'm paying for at a restaurant, BUT this place is the exception that smashes the rule.  Except for mom's, I've never had fried chicken this good before.  Perfectly breaded and fried.  The chicken meat is moist and bursting with flavor (even the white meat is good!)... just falls off the bone while you turn into a chicken hawk for a few minutes & devour what's in front of you.  

The meat & cheese board was excellent... could've been a couple better (more) cheese selections, but the ones served we're all very good.  Love the additions they add to theirs... mustards, jellies & a couple extra condiments.  Especially love the bread they serve it with.  Toasted, but not crunchy so it doesn't disintegrate into your lap after creating your own concoction.

The deviled eggs are spectacular, spiced watermelon is refreshing with a slight kick and the classic buttermilk biscuits are eat the crumbs off the table good (if you get the biscuits & cheese board, the biscuits are great to load up with meat & cheese too).

4030587,2017-03-15,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"My friend and I ate here for dinner after our full day on the Strip having fun. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",qmuoylhKXqMPk9_McrPpNw,0,0,5,eXgsCtorLpq9LpB_RSU7uA
4032590,2015-07-06,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Loved this place!  We actually came here twice on a recent weekend in Vegas.  I feel that many of the restaurants on the strip are totally overpriced and not even close to worth it (last time we ventured to Craft steak and were very disappointed by our VERY expensive meal).  Yardbird is reasonably priced.  Is every dish amazing?  I don't think so, but most of them are pretty darn good, and the fried chicken is awesome, especially with their really amazing hot sauce (we are now on a mission to try to replicate at home -- my fiancee considered offering them $100 so we could take a jar home!).

Other favorites -- the biscuits!  so good and delicious with the honey butter and apple spiced jam.  The roasted cauliflower was also very good - kind of melted in your mouth.  I don't love mac and cheese, but there's is pretty good (maybe not quite as good as how much your waiter/waitress might rave about it, but very solid and worth a try).  The fries were also very solid (and try them with the hot sauce - perfect!).

Less excited about -- the fried pickles - not my thing, but my fiancee thought the pickles were too sweet - wanted something a little more bitter to accompany the batter.  The whipped sweet potatoes - they may be for you, but they seemed very sweet to me.  A few bites were nice, but I couldn't really eat more. 

There were many other things on the menu we wanted to try, but loved the fried chicken so much that we had to get that as our main course twice.  It's pretty crowded, so reservations are recommended and easy on the open table app.  I thought all the staff were very friendly, and were very attentive, seeing if we wanted more food, drinks, or water.

Drink orders and beverages were described to help us decide. Some of the drinks we elected to try include the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade, Southern Revival, and Yardbird Old Fashion. Drinks came out well timed. Drinks each had different admirable elements. 

Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade was sweet match of blackberry and lemon. Not tart. Well masked bourbon. Definitely there.

Southern Revival was made with
Wild Turkey, passion fruit and basil. This was one of my favorites. The drink masked the alcohol with fruit flavors. Not overly sweet. Just right balance of sweet to alcohol. 

Yardbird Old Fashioned was strong as expected. Not much else I can say to that effect to describe. 

Not long after drinks our food order of green tomato blt, Chicken and Waffles, Artichoke Pasta with Chicken, and Daily Catch blackened catfish with cheese grits. Food all came out hot temperature and stayed that way for some time after arriving. 

The green tomato blt were nice pieces of pork belly. Not overly fatty, seasoned, and with balance of lettuce and tomato. Chicken and waffles was a large dish that would have been better served for two. Crispy golden crunchy skin, moist juicy meat, maple butter waffles and spicy watermelon. The watermelon was a different complementing piece from the usual chicken. The square pieces were nice on own, I just didn't feel it. The waffles were thicker than I prefer. Maple helped.

Artichoke Pasta with added chicken was well seasoned. Chicken pieces reminded me of the fried chicken from the waffles. Tender noodles. 
 
Daily Catch blackened catfish with cheese grits was not over cooked tender and bursting with flavor.

Mac n cheese was a small dish but not lacking in taste.

Lewellyn's Fine Fries Chicken - Very, very good. Crispy and so so moist. Great seasoning too. While KFC might tout its original herbs and spices, with this fried chicken you can actually taste those spices. Just a great classic fried chicken with a black pepper kick. Truly fantastic and a must-try. 

Macaroni & Cheese - Served in a skillet with melted cheese and breadcrumbs on top. Looked promising when it hit the table, but turned out to be quite dry, as if it were in the broiler too long and dried out the cheese. Great cheese blend, but should have been a bit more creamy. 

Skillet Cornbread - If there's cornbread on the menu, you best believe I'm ordering it. This was disappointing as well. It was more of a dense cake with sweet cream butter on top than actual cornbread. And since it was served in. Cast iron skillet, I expected a bit more crunch around the edges. It's a shame that it relied on extra butter to be good... The menu states that there's bacon in it, but in reality there's not enough to even taste it. In fact, I made it a point to find it, and all I could find was a sad little speck.

You can make reservations through open table which I highly recommend so you do not have to wait as it is a pretty busy place.  We went for brunch on sunday. Of course we had to try the chicken and waffles and also got the fried green tomatoes and skillet cornbread.  Skillet cornbread was not on the brunch menu but we asked the waiter and he said it would not be a problem.

Yes the chicken and waffles is $36 but it is huge, you get a lot of chicken and wow it was probably the best friend chicken we have had.  And the waffle had a cheddar inside and was crisp.  The bite with chicken, waffle, syrup, hot sauce, and watermelon was perfection.  The syrup was this bourbon honey and the hot sauce was just the right amount of heat.  The fried green tomatoes was a nice treat, the combination of the sauce and tomatoes were delightful.  The cornbread was very good, it was a pretty good portion and if you do have the syrup, definitely try some of that stuff on top of the cornbread!! 

Overall fantastic meal, would definitely come again.  The drinks looked amazing too so think it would be a fun place to go for happy hour.",d04xE1PZBsfk9PY_oVIsMg,2,0,5,4212vzVFIKp4UEHkPq8QpQ

When we arrived, we were immediately seated. The décor is beautiful and very inviting. We ordered their famous fried chicken, which comes with about 4-5 pieces, but nothing else. The waitress did give us the heads up and encouraged us to add a few sides to go with. Highly recommend the brussel sprouts, as they were DELISH!!!

4073545,2015-03-10,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"This restaurant is located inside the Venetian, just beyond the casino floor. They gave us a buzzer to carry around since they have a very limited number of dining tables. They also had a few couches/love seats where you can have your meal, which doesn't really make sense to me because I don't see how you can properly eat a meal on a sofa chair. The wait was about 30-40 minutes for a party of 8. Our waiter was polite and explained that the restaurant is heavily influenced by Southern style cooking and also let us know that the ""Shares"" dishes were pretty big and enough to share between 2 diners at least, possibly more. Cool! 

My boyfriend and I shared the 9 oz. flat iron steak, with 2 eggs and hash browns on the side. However, I was really surprised when our dish arrived because the portions were very average-sized. The other couples in our party also chose to order ""Shares"" plates and it became a point of discussion that these were not the ""huge"" portions we were expecting (ie. dishes from Hash House or the Tractor Room). I think their advertising for these dishes is super misleading. We ordered our steak medium but the edges tasted charred and very overcooked. The eggs and the hash browns were only okay. Overall this meal was very disappointing and NOT worth the $28 price tag. They definitely marked up the price since it's a restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel. 

Also, customer service here is not great. One of my friends who I sat next to asked for straws for our water cups, which never came. She also asked for ketchup for her fries, but it took two requests before that came AND they were halfway through their fries at that point (my boyfriend had to ask again when he saw that no one returned with ketchup for a while).

If you're hungry and in the Venetian area look for another restaurant, this place offers mediocre food and even worse customer service. The only thing this place seems good for is their swanky house cocktails. My friend got a blackberry bourbon lemonade (their most popular drink) and it was well-made and quite strong.",RNdvoZU40cLUh9W78v5hJg,1,0,2,qxdtGy9qY-TLXOdGBGMhRQ
4076391,2016-03-20,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Fried chicken is one of those things few do REALLY well.  Many a chicky place do it sorta well, kinda well, or not well at all.  Residing in the Midwest doesn't really help the situation, as I well know that the home of incredible fried chix is hundreds of miles south and a little due east, but a boy can dream...

One family vacation last year, my sister hijacked a recipe from a James Beard alum that her husband experienced at aforementioned alum's restaurant on a business trip to Miami.  It was, without a doubt, the best fried poultry I've ever had.  

Fast forward 8 months, and we're in Vegas.  It comes to light that the poultry palace from Miami was Yardbird, and it has an outpost location in Sin City.  Reservation made.

We show up on time to a beautifully built-out and decorated restaurant space just outside the casino floor in Venetian.  Touches of the South abound and are intertwined with modern takes on decor.  Example: wood-paneled ceilings and a projector beaming cool images and phrases onto a wall.  A massive Edison light fixture (must be 400 bulbs up there!) outside an open, stainless-steel kitchen.

We lounged in comfy seats next to the hostess reception while they prepared our table, and then were shown to it.

The food menu is succinct and on-point and the drinks menu is deep and wide.  Food-to-drink page ratio is about 1:10.  You shall not go thirsty here.

Our sweet waitress charmed us into eating family style, which I am convinced is the way to go.    Four hungry boys had the Skillet Cornbread, Lewellyn's chicken, Chicken/Watermelon/Waffles, Virginia Ham biscuits, and the Smoked BBQ biscuits.  Between that and drinks, we couldn't fathom dessert.

Every last morsel of edible food on that table was devoured and tasty as ever.  And, it was confirmed at the scene of the crime: this is the best dang fried chicken I've ever had, and that's by a long shot.  It's extremely moist, nearly fall-off-the-bone tender, exploding with flavor, well-seasoned, and crispy without being dry and chewy.  Everything else is bland, dry, abused bird at best now.

Service was charming, prompt, attentive.  Ambiance was dimly lit and very loud (you caught that this was in VEGAS, right?), but I applaud them at doing what they could to make this a great space that takes you out of typical Vegas for an hour or two.

The food was really tasty--the grits were creamy and delicious, brisket biscuit was ""killer"" according to my husband, and the macaroni and cheese was cheesy and delightful. The mimosas and bloody marys (complete with garnishes and a strip of crispy bacon) were also very good. 

I also really liked the ambiance. My large group couldn't snag a reservation so we pulled together some chairs around a couch. Cool bar area and lighting fixtures.

Stopped in on a Sunday morning after they opened based on their sign in the concourse advertising a Tito's bloody mary. And we need bloody marys!

If you're unfamiliar with Tito's vodka, it is a somewhat smaller vodka distillery in Austin, TX. It is a good vodka and has won awards, but is not an ultra premium vodka. It costs about $33 for a handle in OKC. Cheaper than, say, Ketel One.

We sat at the uncrowded bar and we were greeted quickly, but then ignored.  It took several minutes before we were asked what we wanted to order. We quickly ordered two Titos bloody marys to go. Bartender was unimpressed with us. Probably hungover, but that's no excuse. It's a hospitality business.

The cost for two drinks?  $34.  Inexcusable pricing, even for Vegas. Throwing a fatty piece of bacon in there doesn't make it better. I guess we should have asked before ordering, but that was completely unexpected.

May or may not try it again for an actual meal. We were so offended by the pricing it will be hard to go back.


UPDATE: They communicated quickly after reading my review. They were unhappy with my experience and provided a refund, which really was above-and-beyond my level of complaint. I upgraded my rating to A-OK in my book. In my experience, maybe you won't love the whole deal, but you will be taken care of by professionals.",PBQNH3cB4u32dtoSUXIpWA,1,0,3,-IxZeiOguPIElEBy4doG4Q
4090168,2017-10-01,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Our visit to the Yardbird at the Venetian was absolutely amazing. 

FOOD: The food is by far the best southern food I've had since leaving home in North Carolina over 7 years ago. We started with the side of grits which was a nice flavor of home.  They are made with cream cheese and cheddar cheese, which provides a flavorful, yet creamy texture.   Then I had the half chicken with a side of macaroni and cheese.  The chicken tasted just like the homemade fried chicken I grew up on when I was little.  The macaroni and cheese was definitely the best there is in Vegas.  

DRINKS: Aside from the meal, I tried two of their old fashions, both the Yardbird old fashioned and the Banana Walnut. The passion they have for crafting their cocktails shines through with an amazingly smooth finish including undertones of the bitters and infusions which are perfectly paired with each of their hand-crafted cocktails. 

SERVICE:  The service here was by far the best I received during my entire stay in Las Vegas, and the highlight of my dining experience.  It was definitely the perfect ending to my trip.  This is due, in no small part, to our amazing server, Kaitlyn, and General Manager, Stephen.  They both provided the kind of warm hospitality you would expect of an establishment serving traditional southern fare.

I love great customer service. 

We started off ordering their cocktails. We ordered the blackberry bourbon lemonade, southern peach, and southern revival. Out of the three, my favorite was the southern revival. Nice ginger based soda with lemon but still strong and fresh but they were all very good! 

Chicken & Waffles - Amazing!!!! The Waffles perfectly crisp and fluffy. Chicken was moist and juicy without it being dry. The watermelon was refreshing since it's coated in citrus and mint, a good contrast after you dip the chicken in the most delicious honey hot sauce. I usually don't eat the breast because it tends to be dry but it was so succulent and juicy.

Short Rib - SO TENDER. I usually don't order short ribs whenever it's on the menu at any place because more than likely it's dry. But this short rib was so so so good. So tender and moist. The corn, beans, and mash potatoes that it comes with was so good too! The corn had a nice char on it and paired well with the savory green beans that were cooked in butter. The mash was just right. I really recommend the short rib. You just have to try it!

We got the Peach Cobbler for dessert which was baked to order. Very good. Warm and comforting with just the right amount of sweetness to it. My favorite part of the whole thing was the marzipan cookie bowl that the ice cream came in. It was a thick, crispy but chewy cookie with this sweetness to it that's to die for.

Definitely come here if you're in Vegas!!!",Fx31NPCHZw1H26kwn-8jfA,0,0,5,M5qG3ze4ODc3vfneuhVxTA

Deviled eggs came out chilled which was alright.  It was a bit of a ripoff at the price.  green tomato BLT was very good.  It's not a burger but literally thick bacon, frisee on top, and fried panko crusted green tomato on the bottom.  Very creative and tasty, though small portioned at 3.  The bacon had very fatty layers in it which was a downer.  Highlight was the half fried chicken which they are famous for. 4 pieces at $26 which again is not of value but it is indeed the best fried chicken out there.  Why? Even the breast meat inside was juicy.  Virtually no one could replicate that.

One cool thing about this place is all the draft brews are local.  While it's awesome that they support local breweries, the selection is limited and quality is not the best.  For example, ante up amber was a one note wonder.",Z-bTLSYSJL1qIPEusyHQUQ,0,0,4,q87RbJzHugFp9nNPguE0_A

My friendly waitress advised me that this establishment has another location in Miami. The interior decor is hip and chic lounge/bar area are really trendy looking. Being I'm a fried chicken fan, I went with the Lewellyn's fried chicken at $26.00 - 1/2 of free range chicken - marinated for 27 hours and served with spicy tabasco & honey sauce. Instead of ordering a full order of biscuits my waitress said she could just order me one which was perfect with an order of Charred Okra. Overall,  I thought the food was decent and tasty but I've been to southern states and have enjoyed as good if not better fried chicken for less money. Again, what would expect being that it's Las Vegas? The service by my waitress was solid and the music playing in the background was hip older rock.

Best grits I have ever had !!!The more I analyzed the flavors ,the more I suspect they make their grits with cream cheese, heavy whipping cream & butter ..

4160611,2015-09-19,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"My family & I had the most amazing Southern Food experience ever. Yardbird is now one of our new go to restaurants when we're in Las Vegas. The service was above & beyond what we could have asked for all due to Chef Stephen Austin & Pastry Chef Keris. I may not review many places, but I always use Yelp when looking for places to eat & I couldn't help but make sure to give credit to the great staff for this past Saturday nights incredible dinner. I love the fact that we were able to make reservations on Open Table so that we weren't having to wait for a table. We were lucky enough to be seated right next to the kitchen (away from the sounds of the club) where Chef Stephen Austin took the time to talk to us & tell us about several of the dishes we saw going out. This good humored chef personally made sure that our family had a great southern food experience by sending out some extra side dishes. The collard greens with bacon jam (not an item that we saw on the menu) were the tastiest greens I've ever had. They had a nice little kick of spice. Some of my family had never tried collard greens & couldn't stop eating them.
The deviled eggs were ok. They weren't as creamy as I would have liked. 
Loved the biscuits. They weren't at all dry and tasted great with apple butter & strawberry jam.
The chicken n' watermelon n' waffles was the favorite dish at our table. The chicken was crispy on the outside & extra juicy on the inside. Must be from the 24+ hour brining process that we were told about. My fiancé says that this fried chicken is now his favorite fried chicken place. The side of honey hot sauce gave the chicken that bit of spice that some of us loved. The waffles weren't your ordinary plain waffles. They were sweet with cheddar & even better with the maple bourbon syrup. The spiced grilled watermelon was juicy & added a good balance of flavor to the dish. 
My daughter loved the short ribs. Although the dishes were meant for sharing, we barely got a bite to taste since she scarfed the plate down on her own & practically licked the plate clean. The meat was so tender that it easily came off the bone. It came with what I believe were mashed potatoes, corn & green beans but it disappeared so quickly. Obviously she liked the whole plate. We'll definitely be going back to try the ribs & burgers that we heard were also a must try from a friend.
The flavorful cauliflower mash was so smooth that someone at our table kept asking if we were sure they weren't mashed potatoes. 
The mac n cheese was nice & creamy but could have used a little more spice or seasoning to it. 

Pastry Chef Keris (trained under Chef Alan Wong-a chef my uncle raves about in Hawaii) was also kind enough to tell us about the desserts that she had prepared. Although we ordered a couple of the desserts & joked about having 1 of each, she sent over all four desserts. All were delicious. 
The butterscotch cake with the pecan filling, a side of bourbon ice cream & bacon was delicious. I couldn't get enough of the bourbon ice cream.  My fiancés favorite was the strawberry shortcake. It wasn't at all plain or dry, but I can't quite explain the yummy flavors. 
I loved the deep fried Oreos dessert that had the fried rice crispy exterior. The center of the fried rice crispy had a gooey chocolate flavor that I couldn't even place at first. Almost made me forget it was an Oreo. 
I'd go back & ask for a bowl full of the bourbon ice cream with a side of fried Oreos. :). 
The hummingbird cake was ok. I'm not a fan of carrot cakes to begin with but the apric
Over all, we didn't pay as much as we expected for the great service, delicious food & time spent together eating new foods as a family.",8EHN7FytxG3OE2d9pUWbzQ,1,1,5,YgEZRu_aQHf9L-EnHYmUDA

The section we sat at was very intimate and the tables were close to each other. Our server suggested the deviled eggs for a started and of course we got it I love deviled eggs. They were super good and super big. They had smoked trout roe on top which complimented it very well. Also we got the Chicken n Watermelon n Waffle to share. The portion is definitely shareable with another person you get half the chicken (wing, thigh, breast, and a drumstick piece). The chicken skin is not super crispy but the skin was seasoned super well. Once I got to the chicken part it was super hot and super moist and just fell off the bone it was super good with the hot sauce they had too. The cheddar waffle that came with it was super light and fluffy too. I've never had a cheddar waffle but this one didn't disappoint for a first one. The spiced watermelon that came with it was SUPER delicious, it was light and refreshing and the watermelon was the perfect texture definitely a must try.

Go ahead and share it, the chicken is moist and sweet and salty.  Very good, and the amount of waffles and watermelon are excellent.  

At this Vegas location we got the a la carte fried chicken which was still enough to share 1 order with at least 2 people.  This allowed us to get some sides like the okra, french fries, cornbread.  I enjoyed the okra a lot.  The fried chicken was once again moist with that hint of sweet and salty.  It's a slight twist on fried chicken that is worth the try.

WTH was I thinking?  Also I've had a boycott on the Venetian/Palazzo for many years so i had to verify if this was owned by them or the space was just rented. I know semantics but it's MY boycott. 

We had made reservations but still had to wait quite a while for a table even though we'd booked though open table & we'd requested ""fat girl seating"" - we finally were seated and in typical Vegas strip fashion the tables were so close together we could feel the heat coming off the table next to us as they were being served. 

So to the food/drinks: 
Drinks: 
1 round of bloody Mary's served in a mason jar - not original but the bacon salted rim gave it a nice touch. Round 2 was ordered before the waiter left the table. 

Food:  
Deviled eggs:  Piped a delicious with a nice little caper on top and chivy / oniony in the actual deviled portion. 
Fried Green Tomato with pork belly:  I found the tomatoes a bit mushy - not the ""crisp"" solid ones i expected but it might just have been because it was a Sunday and they were busy. 
Chicken and Waffles with some type of bourbon maple syrup.  Best part on this was the watermelon in balsamic drizzle. Again the waffle was soggy and while the chicken was savory but nothing really to write to the old homestead about. 
Another round of bloody Marys! - after waiting almost 20 minutes to see any service person we could grab. 
BBQ Pork belly - Worth every calorie and cellulite dimple it added. 
Dessert: Some chocolate pie/cake something so nondescript I've totally forgotten what it was. 

Seating:  very close together - no arms on the chairs but lots of hip hangover. 
Service:  Not even close to good. Long wait times, excuses and very surly posers - if we were in NYC i'd say they were wannabe actors but i guess these were just wannabes. 
Pricing: It is what you'd expect from a place on the strip. All in with food and 3 rounds of bloody Marys for 2 was $146.00 including tip. 

Overall if i could go back for just the pork belly & deviled eggs & Bacon rimmed bloody marys I would.",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,0,0,3,zkgWRWjahTa15EBDu0cKEw

What can I say? The food, ambiance, and service hit all the right buttons. What I usually get for the table is two orders of the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. It comes with this honey hot sauce and chilled spiced watermelon on the side. Top it off with some bourbon maple syrup and it's pure heaven. The great thing is that it isn't greasy at all!

If you know me, that's a big statement. If you don't, I'm a rather large dude from Texas who was raised on the stuff so I do have a frame of reference. It's one of the most basic of dishes (no sides or accoutrements- just fried chicken) and it is done so perfectly you may not want anything else. However, I usually do when I'm there (big dude, remember?). While I like to find off strip gems when in Vegas, this spot is now on my regular rotation.

WHEN YOU GO- Located in the resto row between the Venetian and Palazzo, Yardbird is unpretentious and at the same time classy. Service has always been good and they understand that the food is the real star here. If you're a little tentative, let your server recommend  add ons and apps. My favorites are the mac and cheese and the pork belly app. And whatever you do, don't skip the fried Oreos for desert. This ain't no Chicken Charlie's fried Oreos from the fair- these are lightly fried and served with a Rice Krispie Treat. Delicious!

Food was so good. Tried a little bit of everything. Mac N Cheese so ooey gooey cheesy, be sure to eat it all in one sitting I imagine it doesn't reheat that well.

Chicken Sando had a delightful little kick to it and the chicken was tender and glorious. The brisket sandwich was bbq sauce genius and tender. 

Burnt ends were so perfectly burned and with the cheese sauce, and the red pepper... easily one of my favorite bites. It just had a little bit of everything that I love in food. All it was missing was ginger. But I think ginger would have ruined it.

Pork Belly BLT!! That shiz was oh so great as well. Fried green tomato, tasted so good, some cheesy mixture and pork belly. It was difficult to eat. Cut it up into pieces and make it more manageable.

Cocktails... sweet heavenly nectar from the gods. I loved each one that I tasted and love their ingenuity and how southern they made them feel. (Note... I have never been to the south, but it tasted like I imagine the south tasting).

Dessert - the cake was dry, the legit only thing I didn't like at all. The banana pudding was yummy but perhaps put it in a jar that is easier to obtain all of the pudding. It just got stuck in the ridges.

THE VERDICT:
A great end to a great weekend. Definitely not the best place in Vegas but it is up there among the great elites of Vegas cuisine. If I wasn't such an adventurer I would guarantee my return but I don't know... there is so much more to discover. I recommend it to other people and be ready for a steep bill.

Our server, Bryan, was probably top 5 waiters I've ever had, hopefully management takes notice as we appreciated how thorough and engaging he was. Thank you! 

They are located inside the beautiful Venetian Casino. 

We ordered a couple beers to start and they had a great cocktail menu, but we just wanted beers instead. 

We both ordered the Yardbird Chicken Sandwich, one without hot sauce. 

As they'll tell you, they are known for their chicken and rightfully so, outstanding. So moist and the perfect accompaniments to make it even better. 

Also, the fries were BACON salted and delicious. 

We also split the Mac and Cheese side to start and it was also great. 

My only gripe was the price of a Coke, it was $6 which is a bit absurd even for Vegas. Especially given the fact my Abita Purple Haze was $6 and Blue Moon $7 but the overall experience outweighed seeing the price tag on a Coke.",oIIno_ryDmjZN8zJe1p93A,0,0,5,4uEABUI4qYqQLegL1r3Pog

We had been present in Vegas for the PAC-12 Games and had just watched the first round of March Madness with the University of Arizona winning.  To celebrate, we went downstairs for some Virginia Ham Biscuits and Peach Cobbler.  Wearing UA shirts which proclaimed our school loyalty,  we were warmly greeted by new manager, Thadius.

We excitedly talked about it as he showed us to our seats.

The food was amazing and the portions were very large.  The peach cobbler was presented BEAUTIFULLY.  It was hot and full of peaches.  The Ham Biscuits were as good as my Mom's.

But what we took away, more than even the food or the warm decor, was the SERVICE!  Thadius checked on my boyfriend and me several times and made sure that our Cobbler was exactly how we liked it.

We ordered the Mama's chicken biscuits which should be in small plates/ appetizers not in a poultry entree. It came with two small chicken biscuits. The flavor was great and the pepper jelly was a great addition however it's on a hard barely edible biscuit and was very hard to eat because of this. We also ordered the Mac and cheese and grits both being relatively average. I've had my fair share of down right amazing mac and cheese and grits these were very tasty but nothing extraordinary. Now for the Salisbury steak, this dish was disgusting my husband said it tasted like canned Chile meat very processed and over seasoned. All I could taste was orange! It tasted like they marinated this meat in orange pin sol and then covered in chile powdered. I ate one bite my husband two. Dessert options weren't very interesting and the one that was actually southern, bread pudding was like someone trying to be southern by just adding a bunch of crap into a dish and being like bam this is a great southern dish. Sadly though adding popcorn and m&ms to chocolate bread pudding with very hard old tasting ice cream on top doesn't cut it. Besides the steak nothing was down right terrible but it wasn't amazing either. I would say if your looking for a place to eat I'd go elsewhere and if your looking for southern food find some good recipes and cook it yourself!",0pE5iB1hc9lLz8vFZYDILw,1,0,2,nPAN7dZ4MEVeSINUD5PKlw

Nice list of Nevada beers on tap and numerous bottles. 

Two of us shared the Mac and cheese and lewellyn's fried 1/2 chicken. The Mac and cheese was very good and served in a small skillet. They are known for their chicken that is marinated for 27 hours and then fried. I have to say, fried chicken should be pretty crispy in my book, this was really greasy and soft. $26 for the chicken and $10 for the Mac and cheese. $8 for a pint of beer.

I happened into Yardbird based on a picture of one of their dishes in the hallway of the Venetian: a chicken salad sitting on a bed of what looked like fried cornbread. The actual dish, smoked chicken, some frisee, avocado, cornbread, and dressing surrounding the chicken.

 The chicken was surprisingly tender and smoky. It was quite a tasty dish; something I would definitely order again. They didn't skimp on the chicken, either. 

Based on that salad, the Yardbird is going to be my go to ""sit down"" restaurant when I come to Vegas. I can't wait to try their shrimp and grits on my next visit.

A side they add to the plate: spiced watermelon.  Honestly I wasnt crazy about the watermelon and didnt finish it but I can see the appeal.  Sweetness of the watermelon combined with what tasted like a cajun type of spice and then there was a weird sour taste to it.  Tried 3 cubes to see if my opinion would change after the first 2.  Nothing wrong with it.  Just not my taste.  Omg the cornbread i LOVED.  Comes in a cast iron pan topped with a giant dollop of butter...melts...drools...

Ambiance was stellar. Country meets hipster meets fine dining. We were greeted by Justin who was phenomenal!  He earned 5/5 on his own!  He believes in the menu, as he should, there was lots of great dishes to try and he was spot on with all of them!

For drinks we tried the blackberry lemonade, very sweet, and an old fashion, bacon infused bourbon, sign me up! Later in the meal we had a flight of IPAs. All local and great!  One of the perks of this place was they only offer local beers on draft. 

Being it was restaurant week, we got a little more bang for our buck. We started out with the deviled egg... Awesome, and the fried green tomato blt... Also Awesome!  The pork belly on the blt was cooked perfectly!

Next came the bone marrow with onion jam. Hello, can I bottle that stuff? It was delicious!  The bone marrow was like butter on the toast and the onion jam gave it the perfect amount of sweetness. 

Next course were our entrees. Here we go, my fried chicken! Wasn't wowed at all. It was just fried chicken. The chicken was very juicy and cooked well, but for me, batter is end all and sadly I wasn't impressed. Being it was restaurant week, the chicken came alongside ribs which fell off the bone and the heartiest, cheesiest Mac n cheese ever!  I felt it stick to my ribs just as it should! 

Now, with this dish, we got the shrimp and grits. WOW!!!!  This meal was no joke!  Perfect amount of sweet and salt and every bite just melted in our mouths!  I would totally go back for that!

We finished with their mud pie, only because it was part of the price fixed menu. I would have preferred the fried Oreos. Next time (because there WILL be a next time) for sure!

Overall, we had a great experience here. I suggest this place to anyone. A perfect spot for a guys night, though I know a bunch of girls who can sling back their bourbon and eat some finger lickin' comfort food!

I have not had a chance to try any of the entrees yet, but that's only because of the amazing fries that Ashley suggested and I can never get enough of. The first time I dined in, I wanted to get a quick bite and a drink before playing a poker tournament. Ashely was my server and asked all the right questions to lead me to a bourbon I had never tried and the best fries I've ever had. Since then, I have only gone in for small bites (and the fries of course!), but I have always relied on Ashley to steer me in the right direction. Assuming I make it to the dinner break in my tournament tonight, I will be eating at Yardbird. 

My only complaint is pretty standard for all restaurants - the liquor prices are too high. It has always frustrated me at the outrageous markup on liquor when the bottle cost is significantly less and there is rarely any spoilage. That is why I will seldom let give five stars.",9Sbts8AiZEggbHHpIJuwPA,1,0,4,TmC2F9nr4djIv09KJg6cSA

We walked up and asked if we could be seated without a reservation. Although busy, they were happy to seat us. The lounge area, as we walked through it, was very noisy. I asked the hostess if the restaurant would be that noisy and she replied that it would not. Well, it was. It's like a Lazy Dog or a Buffalo Wild Wings, in terms of noise levels. I almost turned to C to say, ""Let's go to Grand Lux,"" but I didn't. We sat down and it was the best decision we made all day .

You know how people are always asking, ""Where is the best fried chicken in LV?"" I found it. It's crispy on the outside and moist, tender, juicy and flavorful on the inside and, get this, not one drop of oil or grease. I mean zero!

This is a family style restaurant so we got the chicken, waffles and watermelon. It comes with  1/2 chicken, two waffles and a bunch of chunks of watermelon. The crispy cheddar cheese waffles are topped with a dollop of relish--not pickle relish but green tomato relish. It's different. I liked it. The platter came with bourbon maple syrup and honey hot sauce. The watermelon was tossed with chile and basil. Interesting flavors and all good.

Now, it is rare--extremely rare--for me to order dessert. I'm not a dessert person. For this meal, I crossed over to the dark side. Yes, they spoke to me. Who spoke to me? The deep fried Oreos that were served on a scoop of chocolate toffee ice cream, topped with some toffee candy and decorated with a slice of chocolate candy and drizzled with chocolate sauce--not Hershey's. Nope. Not even close. The best way I can describe it is this: If this were sex, it would be an instant O. Seriously. Oh, and all this wonderful for $25 per person plus tip.

We arrived just before our reservation time and this spot was extremely busy and poppin, especially for a weekday.  There were several people at the bar and many tables were filled with happy, social, and nice casually dressed folks.  People here were just lively and we just really like the atmosphere.  If you're into the contemporary country decor look, this would be the place Joanna Gaines can appreciate or the likes there of.

We were seated in the main eating area, just a little beyond the bar and our waitresses were on point.  They explained the menu in detail and made some great recommendations.  If you're a huge fried chicken fan, I would suggest the chicken & waffles.  There's a little surprise with the watermelon that comes along on the side of your dish but I appreciated the sweetness.  We also ordered the herb chicken and crunchy brussels sprouts.  Our waitress recommended the brussels and they were fabulous!  For real, for real!  I loved the lightness, the crunchiness, and the sweetness to every bite!  As for my herb chicken, I was a little disappointed, my chicken was not tender but the brussels were so amazing it basically made up for it.

I ordered the omelette of the day, and my husband got a kale salad. My omelette arrived underdone (to my eyes) and I sent it back. I felt terrible for sending food back in a place that obviously knew what they were doing, we googled omelettes and found that they can be served runny (you get egg dripping out the sides), this is not my preferred way of eating eggs, and the only thing I would have changed was to have our waitress give me a heads up that this was how they were served. I was amazed by how quickly my dish was whisked away and then returned, with no back talk from the waitstaff. I ended up with a dish that was everything I had hoped for and more. 

I also need to give a special shout-out to the biscuits, and the butter they were served with. I have traveled in the south, and this biscuit rivals the ones my great grandmother made. Impeccably delicious! My biscuit came with a honey butter in its own special jar, I could have bathed in the stuff it was that amazing.

I was almost shocked to see consistent five star ratings for this joint - but it sparked my curiosity. Happy I checked this spot out. Food was yummy and came out fast. Menu offerings are fabulous and cohesively southern-yardbird like. 

Went for the fried chicken sandwich. Two big, juicy pieces of chicken with crisp veggies inside fresh baked buns. It was POPPIN!! And huge! Could have split it. The chicken itself was fried well with minimal coating. You could see how juicy the inside was from the first bite. It was smothered in a honey glaze that was both unusual and memorable. The micro green salad was fresh and cut the grease of the fried chicken. Loved the runny house ranch! 

If I wasn't totally stuffed I would have tried their bread pudding. All the food I'd seen on other tables looked smacking. Nice list of signature cocktails and large liquor, wine, and beer selection, too. 

Making reservations was easy; and probably not even completely necessary. Friendly and chill hostess and servers. Dark, relaxed mood lighting and hipster country decor vibe.

4379941,2016-12-20,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"This may seriously be one of my favorite eats in Vegas. Normally I don't eat fried chicken since it gives me a headache and heartburn, but not the chicken here. My husband and I got two of the chicken dishes, specifically the Chicken n Waffles and the Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken. What I loved was that the fried batter tasted very light and not greasy at all so it doesn't make you feel like you hate yourself after eating a bunch of fried chicken. Normally my husband and I don't eat like to eat the fried parts (I know, it's supposedly the best part), but we were killing the skin. These entrees didn't come with sides so you'll need to order those separately. Try the Fried Green Tomato BLT appetizer.

For drinks, I had the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade which was tasty but too sweet for what I like in a bourbon drink. I more preferred the Southern Revival which was a bit more sour. And you can't go wrong with an Old Fashioned either. Surprisingly, they have a pretty large bourbon menu for being a chicken place.

For dessert, we got the peach cobbler, which was ridiculously enormous for 2 people since it also comes with a huge scoop of ice cream in a cookie shell bowl and a baked cinnamon twist thing. And even more ridiculous that my husband and I still ate the whole thing despite how full we were.

4382021,2017-02-22,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Very disappointed in a restaurant that has Gordon Ramsey's endorsement. When we first arrived my mother ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter came back saying they were out of that particular bottle. So, my mom asked for a suggestion. He said he had not tried most of the wines so he didn't have a suggestion. If you are out of the wine we ordered then you should probably come back with a suggestion for something similar! 

When we ordered our dinner the waiter told us if we wanted the peach cobbler to order it early because it takes 25 minutes to make. So, we put in the order for the peach cobbler right after we ordered our meal. After the meal, my mom reminded the waiter we ordered the peach cobbler. The waiter acted like he didn't know what we were talking about. About 25 minutes after we ate the waiter came over and said the cobbler was coming right out. We waiting another 20 minutes (so a total of 45) then asked another waiter about it. Our waiter never came over to explain. A manager happened to be walking around. So, we told the manager what happened and we told him we just wanted the bill so we could leave. The manager said he would get us our bill and package our cobbler to go. About 5 minutes later the manager came out and said our ticket was lost and our cobbler wasn't ready. So he said he took the cobbler off our bill (duh!) and gave us his card. He told us to give him a call next time we were in town. So, instead of him compensating us right then and there, we have to come back for more horrible service to be compensated!? Our waiter finally came over with a $187 bill and a piss poor apology. The food was not worth the bad service.

4402129,2017-05-12,8,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I don't understand the hype.

I was repeatedly told by others that Yardbird was a place I ""needed to check out"" while I was in town. I have, and I'm underwhelmed.

Conceptually, this should be the kind of place I like: southern cuisine, fried and smothered as it is, is generally an easy score with me when it's done half-way right. And perhaps the problem here isn't that Yardbird has done anything egregiously wrong, but rather they simply haven't executed at a high enough level to demand the prices they're charging for simple, humble food.

I started with a refreshing Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade to go along with an appetizer of Deviled Eggs: four hard-boiled egg whites stuffed with the equivalent of eight yolks. The eggs were substantial and, if I was interested in quantity over quality, they'd have won the day. Alas, egg yolks can become monotonous without copious amounts of help in the way of mustard, mayo, hot peppers, ground pickles, horseradish, and so on, and I feel the kitchen was far too restrained in seasoning the yolks. After just one egg, I was done.

I ordered the Blue Plate Special ($16), essentially two fried chicken pieces: a thigh and a drum stick, a biscuit, spiced watermelon, and ""honey"" hot sauce. I guess I should not have been surprised that they gave me the two cheapest pieces of the chicken they could have put on my plate. If I wasn't a fan of dark chicken, I'd be outraged. The chicken itself was middle-of-the-road, not great, but far from horrible. Yardbird fries the chicken at a higher temperature than I typically would prefer. The resulting darker coating creates a deeper cereal-like flavor that overwhelms any accompanying spices. Some people like this style, even if I'm not a fan. There's a fine line between meeting food safety standards and over-cooking chicken, and Yardbird is not the type of restaurant to take risks. Too bad. I would have liked the meat to be a bit juicier.

The spiced watermelon was interesting, more sour than spicy (think sour gummy candy) --but  at just four pieces, not enough of it is provided to win hearts and minds. The biscuit was probably the highlight of my plate. They nailed the biscuit - buttery, flaky, just the right amount of density. I could kiss Yardbird's biscuit and sing to it.

Maybe it's because my father was a chef from the south and I grew up eating this kind of food, but I don't believe the food at Yardbird earns five or even four stars. Also, this place shouldn't be charging $16 for a fried drumstick, fried thigh, and a biscuit. That's insane.

I'd be interested to hear from all of the people who love this place -- did I order the wrong dishes? Am I being unfair? Let me know!

Came to eat at this restaurant with my family tonight was slightly busy but didn't look too bad. Was told by a very nonchalant hostess 'oh, about 30 minutes' we were then told we could wait on one of the couches in a lounge area near the bar and entrance. 20 minutes goes by, we were sitting next to the only other African-American family who we thought were waiting too like us and the other people sitting around that weren't drinking and clearly there for the bar.
Then, we saw them served food and realized they were at a small table crammed in that area for what reason i don't know other than to literally have a 'worst table in the house'. It wasn't lost on me that the only other Black family was seated there.
My wife also kept noticing group after group of people with similar size parties coming in getting seated immediately. I realized then, wait the hostess didn't even ask our name.
So 25 minutes in I go up and ask 'you never asked our name don't you need that to seat us?'
She then tried to say' I told you if you wanted you could dine over there and you said yes'. Which was a blatant lie so i said so why did you tell us 30 minutes? Why has no one come over? So then shes like oh itll just be another 20 minutes.
So we waited another 10 minutes when more people came in and looked like they were told it was a wait. They waited a few minutes and then miraculously GOT SEATED. My wife had enough and started to storm out and give the hostess a piece of her mind which is met with more indignant nonchalance.
I don't know how the other locations are and im not saying everyone there is racist as they clearly had a couple African Americans working there. But this location and incident in particular the horrible hostess on staff this evening need to be highlighted so people can steer clear and you can bet as PR professionals we will be taking to social media about this soon and often",05wWBdOR3_jGez0QkDwrOQ,0,0,1,TMJW8hjkbskd0EUSVk9wsw

The ambiance here is pretty cool: dimly lit, southern lounge kind of vibe with plush couches spread all about.  It sort of reminded me of one of my southern cousin's living rooms in Georgia.  You can opt to sit at a table here, but let's be serious-- considering how cozy the couches are, I don't see a reason to wait for a table or sit at the the bar on a hard stool when you can have fried chicken served to you on a couch.

Upon first glance at the menu my inner fat boy was overwhelmed with excitement.  Mac n cheese, pancakes, fried chicken, waffles, shrimp and grits, cornbread and not to mention an array of southern inspired cocktails that sound really good when you're not hung over from the night before like we were.  We opted for the fried chicken, cheddar waffle and cornbread.

The presentation of the plates at the Yardbird is great.  The plates look like your Auntie from the deep south who hasn't seen you in 15 years is excited that you've come to visit and because she's so excited, she has piled the fried chicken high on your plate and added extra butter everywhere because she loves you so much.  Meanwhile the flavors of the food here are kind of hit and miss.

The cheddar waffle wasn't very good at all, but the bourbon maple syrup that comes with it was really good.  I would have been happy with a regular fluffy waffle and not a fancy cheesey one.  The fried chicken left a little something to be desired.  The skin was crispy as it should have been but something about the seasoning was off.  I didn't really enjoy the chicken.  The plate also comes with watermelon, which by itself would have been nice and refreshing but at Yardbird they douse it with a little seasoning, that to me at least, is overkill.  The cornbread was just alright.

I left the yardbird slightly disappointed as my conclusion here is that while everything we ordered sounded really good, it didn't quite deliver on taste, but as with all things in Vegas, if you're drunk enough, you'll probably enjoy it!",QKFP7Oy0e18W2I5jbedDOw,8,2,3,HiCdeq7lnOVAiKxK5IUxkw

We started off with a wedge salad and sadly I enjoyed that more, it was crisp and had nice thick cut pieces of bacon.
Our server tried a little bit too hard and actually did more harm than he did good. His selling skills were more harassing than they were suggestive and he was trying to hard to be funny while continuing to run in on our conversations during dinner.

4494888,2017-02-11,7,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"ATMOSPHERE:
It is located inside The Venetian, and it is a very busy spot. Luckily, I had made a reservation prior, because I knew this was a place that I didn't want to miss! It is beautifully decorated. The bar area is located as soon as you walk-in, and they have a comfortable and nice waitng area to order drinks before you are seated. They have light fixtures with mason jars. They have centerpieces with mason jars, but they are taken away as soon as you are seated. The napkin roll ups are adorable, and they say ""Elbows off the table."" 

SERVICE:
Matt was a fantastic server! Seriously... he provided really friendly and professional service. I would completely recommend him. If you can, request him.

FOOD:
Wow. The food was delicious. I ordered the Yardbird Chicken sandwich, and my husband ordered the Swine Burger. They were both sooo yummy. The chicken sandwich was so juicy, and the breading was crispy and seasoned well. It was a big piece of chicken, too! The burger was really good, but as far as looks go, my husband stated that mine looked good and wanted to try it. I wouldn't share. Hahaha. The fries were great, and the only complaint that we had was that we wanted MORE! Lol. We skipped dessert, but my husband did order a drink, which he thought was great.

OVERALL:
We ended up with check #777. Was it lucky? I guess it was. We didn't lose money on this trip, nor did we win the big bucks; we broke even. To me, that's lucky! The question is... would I visit this establishment again? And the answer is... YYEESS!!!",soXCrtlQ3_z_kBC7OrT-_Q,9,10,5,oxJ-5uFAoCpbTD3ATLLD3g

Our party barely even used the menus given to us and just ordered with our eyes seeing all the different southern entrees coming out.  

The food is quite heavy and I don't recommend this place if you're going to go party directly afterwards.  I ended up sharing the crunchy yardbird sandwich (basically a fried chicken sandwich) and it was the smart thing to do for my waistline.  The sandwich was quite delicious and the kitchen was kind enough to cut the sandwich in half so my friend and I could easily split it (they even put an extra cornichon on top so each of us could enjoy one).  The fried chicken sandwich does have Crystal hot sauce which gave it a nice little zip to it.  The sandwich does come with a side of buttermilk sauce but I barely used it since the sandwich was already delicious.  The sandwich does come with a generic green salad that neither one of us ate.

We also got an order of fries which comes with the same buttermilk sauce.  The fries were ok, I've had better, but they were a nice accompaniment to the sandwich.  I recommend only getting one order of fries for four people.  The food is so heavy and rich you won't want to stuff your face with fries.

Our table of four also got bloody marys all around.  Yardbird knows how to make a delicious bloody mary.  The bloody mary is garnished with pickled okra, cornichon stuffed olive, and a picked green bean and finally the best part... BACON!  The only thing that was disappointing about the bloody mary was the fact that you couldn't really taste the alcohol (I guess that could be good or bad depending on the person). 

If I had enough of an appetite I would have ordered cinnamon apple hand pie or the maple bacon doughnut.  I guess I will have to make another visit the next time I come.",aT8XPrYOWORUwMR9jlBnpQ,0,0,4,4J_k7GCvHNPtU6pqMI40uQ

There was 1 maybe 2 strawberries sliced on the waffle (not exaggerating) and very little chocolate and Carmel sauce drizzled on it. The waffle was airy and small. Cost $15, tasted pretty good but was like eating a small snack. The brisket tasted really good but was also pretty small portion. The fries were good but there were only 20-25 larger fries.

I didn't think my friends and family would want to try it, since they were visiting from Louisiana, but they liked the twist on the southern food on the menu and agreed. 

Facility: located inside the Venetian, the restaurant is very elegantly decorated. They have a big bar area with high seats, some bar seating, and some couch seats. We elected to sit in the restaurant portion which had mostly tables and chairs and some half booths. 

Service:  We were sat immediately and our waiter was super nice. He gave us several suggestions, which we ended up ordering them all, plus some. He did not steer us wrong on any of the dishes. 

Food: we ordered a ton of food, and shared everything family style. We ended up taking home more than we ate though. Just too greedy!  LOL! 
BONE MARROW: 4/5 - this is some of the best marrow I've ordered because there was significantly more to dish out than many places I've ordered it. The tomato jam added the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the rich of the marrow. The only reason I'm marking it down, because like most places, they never give you enough toast to eat it with. 
GREEN BEANS: 4/5 - loved the tartness the yogurt added to these. 
Mac and cheese: 4/5 - smaller portion, but very good!
CORNBREAD: 5/5 - usually I prefer a sweeter cornbread, but this was really good. 
FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT: 4/5 - the tomato was cooked perfectly and I loved he pork belly.
BISCUITS: I was actually too full to even try one, but the family and friends loved these
FRIED CHICKEN: 5/5 - This was some of the best fried chicken I've had. The coating was crisp and flavorful, and the chicken was juicy and delicious!!! 
SHRIMP AND GRITS: 4/5 - I loved the grits and sauce...I didn't try the shrimp...but I actually like Lola's a tad better. 

Overall: I really enjoyed the food. I think family style was the way to go, so you could taste a lot, but we had so much food to take home. The atmosphere was nice, and the service was great. I would definitely come back!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,4,5,WAvHSqMisG10BCSwPRXuVQ

Service was average relative to expectations.  Food was average, and overly priced.  I've had better fried chicken at these prices!  It was tender and fried well without being overly battered, but nothing that was impressive. The bourbon maple syrup was delicious though.  Jambalaya was A-OK and was rather watery with the au jus and not the zesty flavors I was used to.  However, the eggs were perfectly poached.

The great smell of BBQ smokiness and the rustic chic light fixtures give this place a warm, welcoming character. The local list of beers always wins points with me. I don't normally go for fried chicken, or chicken anything for that matter, as it's usually a overcooked, dried out piece of rubber, but the fried chicken and biscuits were tender, juicy and flavorful. The pepper jelly perfectly cuts through the savory fat of the chicken and the buttery richness of the biscuits. Service is great. Everything just very on point. 

It's worth knowing there's a whole back dining area with full size tables. I was originally a little concerned we'd be eating on the couches in the front, but there's a whole back you can't quite see from the front of the restaurant. The place is spacious, cozy and smells like delicious wood smoke. It's low-key and perfect for just hanging with someone with no pressure.

We weren't in Vegas for very long, but luckily we found our way to Yardbird for dinner on our last night!

We ordered the house fries, fried chicken, and short rib. We knew not to spend our stomachs on salad at a Southern restaurant.

The fries were great, but super small for the price.

The fried chicken is DEFINITELY something you should order when you're here. The batter was flavorful, crispy, and light enough to appreciate the meat underneath. They served it with a spicy sauce that tasted similar to tobasco.

The short rib plate was delicious. The meat fell apart and the cauliflower/potato mash paired SO well with the charred corn underneath. This was my favorite dish!

Our server was fantastic, giving us recommendations right off the bat. The environment was rustic and cool, and the open kitchen was fascinating to observe.

Chicken liver was intense. Huge portion on a piece of toast. Almost too much liver.

The restaurant only makes reservations for groups of 6, and larger groups are first come first serve in the lounge area. Surprisingly though, the staff did an amazing job accommodating us and made my friends birthday a success.

Environment: located in the lobby between Venetian and palazzo, the southern themed restaurants offers a bar/lounge area that is communal in addition to a back area where there are additional table seating. 

Service: obviously I am quite impressed by their care. I can imagine it being tough to service a group of 10 in the lounge area where we moved couches and coffee tables together, but they did everything they can to make our experience enjoyable. They constantly checked on us, made sure we were hydrated, and gave us our food actually quite quickly. They even offered a birthday ice cream cobbler for my friends 30th, which was super delicious. 

Food: this spot is known for their fried chicken and waffles with the watermelon. It taste soooo good. Extremely juicy chicken, nicely fried surface that is not too salty or hard. The waffles also taste good, and paired nicely with the chicken. It also came with syrup, hot sauce and watermelon squares. It might sound random, but the watermelons add a nice quenching touch after eating some fried food. I also had some shrimp and grits which were bomb. Actually my first time having it, but there was plenty of shrimp and it was also very juicy and slightly grilled. My friend had the mac and cheese also, extremely cheesy and a great selection of a long macaroni. 

Drinks: I had the old fashion, which is apparently marinated in bacon or something. My greatest appeal was the round ice cube. You know a bar is good when there is no white bubbles in the ice cube, it's just classy. My friend also had the blueberry lemonade cocktail. It was refreshing and worth ordering.

Overall, delicious food and drinks, fun environment, and I really appreciated the staff accommodating us. Thanks for a great time for me and my friends birthday!",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,1,0,5,se70oL2xacigoIUpYu2aDg

My boyfriend decided on the blue plate special. Two pieces of their fried chicken, spiced watermelon and a homemade biscuit. They gave him the option of what pieces of meat he wanted which I thought was neat. He decided on half white meat and dark meat and chose a breast and drumstick. He loves fried chicken and said this was the best he's ever had! Juicy and full of flavor. I had the grilled chicken BLT. The combination of chicken, pimento cheese, bacon, and a fried green tomato was amazing. The chicken was juicy, bacon was a large thick slice of what almost reminded me of back bacon and the fried green tomato was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside!

4593233,2016-05-24,3,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Boring buffets and overpriced steakhouses are de rigeur in Vegas, which made me that much more intrigued by Yardbird.  Could Southern-inspired comfort food really manage to stand out -- especially somewhere as over-the-top as the Venetian/Palazzo hotel-casino megacomplex?

The answer to that is an unqualified YES.

Yardbird is one of the best things going in the Venetian/Palazzo, and on the Strip in general.

Of course, step one is just finding the damn place.  Yardbird is buried deep in the resort, and you have to muddle your way through the endless expanse of the Venetian casino just to find it.  The hike is worth the trouble, though.  The slot machines and poker rooms become a fading memory once you make your way into the dark, stylish restaurant.

I was at Yardbird with a few friends (and reservations, which are an absolute must).  After we were seated, we immediately started with a round of appetizers to share.  First up were deviled eggs with dill, chive, and trout roe.  These deviled eggs were easily the best I've ever had.  They were enormous, packed with flavor, and had an incredibly silky texture.  The combination of egg and dill -- spiked with the saltiness from the trout roe -- is pure heaven.

Next was Yardbird's signature dish, the fried green tomato BLT.  And believe me when I say that this dish is totally worth the hype.  Perfectly fried tomatoes (without an iota of extra grease), nicely smoked and crisped pork belly, smoky and spicy tomato jam, fresh and crispy frisée, pungent pimento cheese, and tangy pickled lemon vinaigrette make every bite a party in your mouth.  The flavor in this dish is just out of control.

I was already almost full after these appetizers, so I opted for something (quasi-)healthy as my entree -- the farmers salad, with a side of fried chicken on top.  The salad itself was excellent, with abundant fresh veggies and a hard-boiled egg for protein.  But the superstar was really the fried chicken, which was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  It beautifully crisped on the outside, juicy on the inside, and coated with a wonderfully peppery mix of spices.  Total perfection all around.

My friends each loved their entrees.  One had the shrimp and grits, while another had the special of the day, which was a gluttonous mess of fried chicken, buttermilk biscuits, bacon, and gravy.  You know it's a fantastic meal when everyone is so enamored with their dish that nobody wants to share.

Another plus is that the prices at Yardbird are surprisingly reasonable.  Most brunch spots on the Strip charge twice as much for food made with half the quality and care.

Yardbird is just fabulous.  It's probably my favorite casual spot on the Strip these days.  I foresee additional visits here in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,7,6,5,_Xg9N3FaXiiG56ewAL3wkg

We ordered the bone marrow and jalapeño corn bread. Both were OUT OF THIS WORLD and filled with so much flavor. The hubs enjoyed his blackberry bourbon lemonade and I was happy when they brought a pitcher of water for me personally. The presentation was impeccable and I thought it was very classy when our bartender 'set' the table right in front of us before our meals were served. Made us feel extra special.

The Restaurant:
Like I mentioned above, we were able to sit in the kitchen area even though they usually sit for parties of 6+ in that area. I mentioned it being our 10th Anniversary week and they made a special exception for our party of 4.

We ordered the mac & cheese, fried chicken (without watermelon), short ribs with green beans and cauliflower mash and the salmon pasta. All of it was amazing wonderful and perfect in every way.

To finish off our exceptional meal, we all ordered dessert which could have easily been shared. Deep fried Oreo cookies, fig molten chocolate cake, blueberry/lemon sundae and the bacon/butterscotch 4 layer cake.

The rustic interior with communal tables are comfortable and inviting.  I really loved Yardbird!!!!",mX84lBw8jwS2uQqdgKu_aA,6,5,5,P3Rsl5vyyC3HcOCeD20t9Q

The ambience of Yardbird is great, they have a good bar, tables, and a lounge with couches and small tables. We settled on the lounge, which was very comfortable. We started off exploring the massive drink menu. They have a long list of their own signature cocktails. I tried the southern revival, which was served in a Mason jar as a cool touch. It was good, though a bit sweeter than i thought it would be. After that i went to the craft beer menu, which is ever changing and always full of great choices, including some seasonal varieties. I didn't get a chance to get to their fantastic whiskey and bourbon menu, but wow there is a lot there. For an appetizer we tried the deviled eggs because they are one of my favorite things to try at restaurants that serve them. Unfortunately these were the one disappointing part of the meal. I've had much better. For the entrees my wife tried the chicken salad sandwich. It was different than most I've had but full of flavor and very smokey. Not too strong on the mayo which is a plus to both of us. I of course had to get the famous chicken and waffles. They were different than i expected but in the most positive way. They were very classic and traditional, most restaurants like to put their own spin on them. I had expected to receive several pieces of boneless fried filets, but they just pile several pieces of their amazing fried chicken on the plate instead! If you don't want the waffles and watermelon, go for the fried chicken on its own. It is some of the best I've ever had. The watermelon was spiced nicely while the waffles were kept simple and cooked perfectly. Came with some house made syrup and hot sauce which paired very nicely. On top of all this the service was fantastic. Highly recommended.",cnz1bXC3rmmTMpGSXrjHsQ,0,0,5,3_ILQSbfw6WSjtXrQ7OJew

The breading; however, was delicious. Mac n cheese was just okay, and the brussel sprouts were pretty good. The butter lettuce salad with mango was very disappointing as there were hardly any toppings on it- I think I found 2 walnuts on the salad. Service was great though, and the waiter was very friendly.

That's REALLY exciting news, because the food at Yardbird was the highlight of my short vacation/mostly business trip last month.

and...

their CHEDDAR CHEESE WAFFLES were the entire reason why. They were trulyyyyy the best waffles I had ever tasted in my life. The cheese didn't stand out much, but it was also very easy to look past it, because the waffles were sooo perfect in other ways.

~~thin and crispy

We went back for dinner the next day, and I did what should've been done two mornings before. Ordered a whole serving of waffle and didn't share. Well, I didn't want to share and made myself very clear about that, but was bullied into giving up 1/4 of it anyway.

The chicken batter was light and flavorful. The chicken itself was juicy and moist! The grits were excellent. They were thick, hardy and flavorful! Soooo good! They came out fresh and piping hot. The cornbread was all kinds of good! Sweet, hot & fresh! The perfect side for fried chicken. Fresh butter served on the side . I definitely splurged and put plenty on top of my cornbread!

My husband loved his burnt ends and ribs! I tried a bite of each and I was in heaven. Smokey and moist! No complaints from either of us.

The service is what really blew me away! We had the opportunity to meet a few of The managers who went above & beyond to make sure that we had a good visit. Our server was outstanding! So friendly and attentive.

It's a super small serving but you'll want to split it so you don't feel guilty for eating the whole thing. We also ordered the cheese waffle and the only complaint I have about it was that it was lukewarm when it came out. If it was hot like I'm assuming it should have been, then I would have enjoyed it ten times more. The fries were good too but just regular fries. I ordered a coca cola and opted to drink from the bottle which I haven't seen in years so I loved that. The dessert selection was sinful. We ordered the M&M bread pudding with caramelized popcorn and it was just awesome.

My wife got the chicken with waffles and watermelon. This was a HUGE dish - so although it could be considered pricey, it's so big it's definitely worth it. Again it was all delicious!
We got a banana pudding for desert and it was the perfect end to a meal .

I didn't really look over the menu choices much because it was an easy decision... chicken and waffles. The chicken was extremely juicy and delicious. The spice on the watermelon gave it a nice twist. The waffle was good and I enjoyed the bourbon maple syrup.

The problem with Yardbird is the price. The chicken and waffles were $36. After adding a soda, tax, and tip, this meal ended up costing $52. I realize these are Strip prices, but this was an overpriced meal even when factoring in the Strip restaurant markup. Was the food delicious? Absolutely. Was it $52 delicious? Absolutely not.

4667281,2016-03-23,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"The term yardbird, over the years, has had different meaning over the years. It is said to have been coined in the 1940s and was a reference to a soldier under a disciplinary measure or a convict (restricted to a specific place, the yard), and now it is being used to refer to the humble chicken, as in this particular establishment.

I was doing a day trip to Vegas for a conference and hobbled (stress fracture in my foot, I'm in a boot) from the Mirage over to the Venetian to try their fried chicken. They note, in their menu, the long preparation time for their chicken. I got the blue plate special which is two pieces of chicken, a buttermilk biscuit and their cubed watermelon (I think it was service with mint).

The chicken wing was good, nice and crispy, and quite tender. The other piece, breast meat, was also quite tender but the crust was more of the KFC original recipe versus a thick, crispy, outer coating, which is my preferred format for fried chicken.

As for the biscuit, folks, if you are going to do a buttermilk biscuit, realize that is much of a cultural envoy of Southern Culture as the yardbard. The one i received was square and seemed like it was pulled from a series of connected biscuits. It was a bit dry and felt more like an afterthought and not like the chance it is to impress the true lover of good Southern cooking.

As for the watermelon, it didn't have much flavor at all. it needs a little something to also stand out on the plate.

I did like that all the beers on draft were from local breweries in Nevada and I had a great IPE called a ""dirty dog."" 

Accordingly, I can say, i wasn't unhappy with the meal but all three main food items have an opportunity to be better. As with many things in Vegas, though it is a great city, the hype, at least for me, did not live up to expectations. Though I may come back for the twice fried chicken wings if I'm back in Vegas again.

They were super busy and completely booked except for first-come, first-serve at the bar OR the option to sit and eat at one of their couches. Boringly, we opted for the bar, because my partner didn't feel like eating on a couch and we were exhausted on the last day of a week-long stay in Vegas. 

Starting out with a couple of cocktails (a Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade and a Southern Peach), we were impressed with the flavor of the drinks and the flair with which the bartender concocted them.

My Kale Salad with Crispy Chicken was exactly what I wanted, although I thought the chicken could have been crispier, warmer, and fresher tasting. Also, their cornbread croutons got soft and soggy very quickly, which was a slight disappointment. However, overall, my meal was good with most of the ingredients being fresh, I was famished, and I hadn't had many veggie-centric meals during our trip, so despite not being completely wowed I still gobbled the whole salad up. 

My partner described his burger as ""like a McDouble, but a hundred times better."" He was neither disappointed nor amazed. This is normal for him.

I would eat here again, but next time I would probably stick to the tried-and-true menu items that everyone else has raved about, like their Chicken and Waffles or their Eggs Benedict.",Nto3b0aMrMPNFMuy0sZq0Q,1,1,4,HeogrIXeJL6ZiUcQrpWyxw
4675175,2015-09-23,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Celebrated my friend's birthday here during Labor Day weekend. Made reservations almost 2 weeks in advance and the only time they had available was 4:30pm for our group of 10. So tip: make reservations early! 

The restaurant itself is located downstairs of the Venetian. Follow signs for ""Restaurant Row"". We got lost trying to find it. Once inside, the decor was very ""Southern-charm"" kind of welcoming. You'll see the bar stocked with all kinds of whiskey and bourbon. I was definitely liking the vibe.

When seated, our waitress offered us a ""chefs choice"" type of menu served family style. Basically we tell them our price range per person, any allergies, and likes and dislikes. This was a pretty cool option, since it allowed our group to try a variety of dishes with portion sizes large enough to feed everyone. Our budget was $20-25 per person. 

First 3 dishes were salads. 
- Butter Lettuce & Mango Salad: The actual butter lettuce pieces were huge and made it difficult to eat and share. The dressing was light. Nothing spectacular.

- Kale Salad: Also meh. Did not like the chucks of cheddar cheese, but the croutons were good. 

- Iceberg Wedge: The only salad I really liked. Mostly because of bacon, charred corn, avocados, and ranch! Yum!

- Fried Green Tomato BLT: Individual appetizer. One for each of us. Not your standard BLT because of the odd additional of melted pimento cheese. I liked it but many in my group didn't.

Entrees
- Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles (with 2 sides of extra chicken): Their house specialty. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy in the inside. The waffles were savory cheddar waffles, which were really delicious and paired well with the sweet maple syrup. Really liked the watermelon, which had chili spice on it and cleansed your palate after each bite of chicken and waffle.

- BBQ Pork Ribs: Not the best I ever had but pretty solid. They could have been more fall-off-the-bone tender. It had just the right amount of BBQ sauce and was not overpowering (and most importantly, not drenched like some other places are). Two of us got 2 ribs, but the rest of us only got 1.

Sides
- Mashed Potatoes: Good. I love all mashed potatoes.
- Heirloom Tomatoes: Not a fan. Ate one and was done.
- Green Beans: Good. The yogurt sauce was interesting.
- Okra: Did not try. Don't like okra in general.

Dessert
- Bacon Butterscotch Cake: On the house for my friend's birthday! And they gave us the regular large portion rather than a small sample. It was a little too sweet if I ate more than a few bites, but definitely a good way to end the meal.

With tax and gratuity, it came out to more like $30-35 per person, which was totally worth it for all the food we got. Service was attentive and very accommodating (we made them switch our tables in the beginning and they did it without question). Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon since there's so many other places to try in Vegas, but I would recommend if you never been!",9IX2jJzDNvODLA9EzSKV5A,1,0,4,t0CwRDvloYN4ak-zczHhVw
4676180,2018-06-24,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Quite an experience. Some friends and I were in Vegas and we were looking for somewhere to eat brunch. I'm looking on Yelp! (of course), I stumbled upon Yardbird. The reviews were great so we decided to give it a try. Something told me to book a reservation, even though there were SEVERAL open time slots. Luckily I did because when we got there, we heard the hostess telling people 1.5 to a 2 hr wait for a table. WHOA! However, once we got into the restaurant, we noticed it wasn't that crowded. Oh well. The decor was nice and a rustic southern style. Cute. The staff was very polite and talkative. Everything started off pretty well. 

The drinks were pretty good. I tried the Southern Peach. It was okay, not too sweet which I liked. The amount of liquor in it was okay and it wasn't overly peachy tasting. It was a nice combo of flavors. My friends liked their drinks as well. 

We got the shrimp and grits, smoke brisket, and the peach cobbler. The shrimp and grits were good. Nothing like other recipes I've had before, be it a restaurant or homemade. Their gravy (chicken jus) was the difference and I've never had tomatoes in my shrimp and grits. So it was different, not bad, just new flavors. The shrimp were a very nice size so it was filling. My friend liked his brisket. He said it was smoked well and cooked just right. The peach cobbler was meh. It was bland to me and the peaches weren't that soft. The dough wasn't flavorful either. I have had and made better. They give you a dessert bread stick that's similar to a churro but was more like philo dough. It was bland as well. 

We had a good experience at Yardbird. The staff was good and so was the food. Caution, this place is pricey so don't waste your money on the peach cobble.",0HtGmq4yDhNOwl9HtLT21w,0,0,4,aVM0kwjJpTqFkQqt__yxaw

4683387,2016-06-01,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Wow! I am thoroughly impressed by Yardbird. A week before our Vegas trip I saw it listed in my AAA Via email in their 6 places to go in Vegas article. For some reason this stood out more than the rest and I decided to make reservations for my husband's birthday. I saw pictures of the maple glazed bacon donuts (mmm, bacon) and couldn't miss out on those so brunch it was. We arrived and were greeted by the friendly hostess, and immediately after sitting we were greeted by our waiter. In Vegas the service is always pretty good because hotels live by their reputation, but each person on the wait staff from top to bottom was A+.

We ordered the donuts along with coffee and a couple cocktails. I had the Rumble N Sway, and my husband had the Southern Revival. I'd have to say mine was a bit strong for brunch (better for dinner) but it was smooth and tasty. The Southern Revival was a bit more refreshing. I'll have to try the Bloody Mary I saw next time - it had a whole slice of bacon as part of their garnish! Yum! I didn't see it on the brunch or cocktail menu somehow. Bummer! Anyhow, back to the donuts...they were SO tasty! They weren't overly sweet or heavy, and the butterscotch dipping sauce was the bomb! I saved half of them for later, which were needed after a heavy drinking day in Vegas let me tell you haha.

Then I had the fried chicken and waffles and the hubby had a special biscuits and gravy. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful, albeit a little heavy on the salt but better than bland, am I right?  I didn't need much of the bourbon maple syrup because everything just melted in your mouth. I wasn't a fan of the watermelon but it was refreshing with all the heavy food. His biscuits came with a piece of chicken and then slices of thick bacon and country gravy over them.

After the meal, our server brought out a birthday ""dessert"" for the hubby's birthday. Because we already had the donuts he gave us a coffee cake, but by then we were STUFFED to the brim! Really nice gesture though. Again, the service was a real star here. I'm going back each time I go to Vegas now because I still need to try the shrimp and grits, and for sure that bloody Mary!",iY6kcazlSZKYxOvDbJ652w,0,0,5,NDDIfJhpJL1GPEJvGaFe5w

Decor - This place is all about the details. Every thing was thought out from top to bottom, the lights, the tile, the sink levers, repurposed wood paneling, the chairs, menu, etc. You can tell the interior designers had some fun with this place.

The place is bigger than you think.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different  bourbon drinks being made.  I absolutely loved that the drinks were served in a mason jar.  Even the ice wasn't standard cubes but were oversized cubes or a sphere depending on your drink choice.  I had the blackberry bourbon lemonade and the southern peach.  Both drinks were wonderful and while having a lot of flavors, the bourbon was able to be showcased.  

They have a large beer menu as well.

The deviled eggs were delicious and not just your standard devil egg.  They were full of flavor and very elaborate in there presentation.

For the main course we got the fried chicken and the mamas chicken biscuits.  The chicken is SO good.  Fried just enough for flavor but so tender!  The chicken biscuits were amazing!

Although the we had tried so much stuff, we couldn't help but get dessert to go.  Chocolate bread pudding and butterscotch cake.  Both had unique flavors and were great.

Service: pretty decent. We were served right away. Water was refilled at a decent pace. The made it clear st the beginning that the food will be brought out when it is ready and not necessary in which it was placed. So some there was some lag in between but not bad. 
Food: mainly southern comfort food. It was restaurant week so there were pretty decent specials going. Devil eggs were pretty good. A tad much on yolk. I liked the fried green tomato. Nice chunks of bacon on top. Fried chicken was above average. Moist and flavorful. Bbq ribs were ok as well. My favorite item was the mac and cheese.

The decor is nice and service was great. And the food is certainly better quality than KFC. Therefore it gets 3 stars.

My white chicken was overcooked.

As for the other items, the roasted carrots weren't roasted long enough. The fries were good, but for $10 bucks they better not mess up fries. The fried green tomatoes with pork belly were okay, but the pork belly was overcooked.

Kale Salad ($13): Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, apples, cornbread croutons, house-made moonshine raisins, and cider vinaigrette. I love kale and I love kale salads, but this was not doing it for me. The sharp cheddar really overpowered everything else, so no other flavors could shine.

Virginia Ham Biscuits ($14): Mama's Biscuits with Virginia ham and Vermont sharp cheddar cheese. These are great! The biscuits are fluffy and delicious and the ham and cheese was perfect. I would love to try all the other biscuit combinations.

Swine Burger 2.0 ($18): Short rib, brisket, and chuck blend, house smoked pork belly, house pickles, smoked Gouda cheese, pickled onions, and frisée.

Admittedly, not my top fried chicken, but really damn good. The waffle is amazing. I'm not going to hate on any waffle that has cheese in it! The honey hot sauce and the bourbon maple syrup and both phenomenal. This is a solid Chicken and Waffles.

House Fries ($8): Tossed in bacon salt and served with housemade buttermilk ranch. Bacon. Salt. They crisp up bacon, finely crush it, and mix it in with salt. Then, these already delicious fries are covered in this heavenly concoction. It's really good stuff. Also, I'm a huge fan of buttermilk ranch, but you don't need it with these fries.

Hummingbird Cake ($10): Cream cheese icing, banana pecan ice cream, caramelized pineapple. I love hummingbird cake because I love pineapple, bananas, and pecans. The dehydrated pineapple was a nice touch on top of this cake. It's too bad they don't have this on their menu anymore!

Banana Pudding ($10): Rum-soaked banana cake, chantilly cream, fresh bananas, vanilla wafers, and house made banana chip. Another favorite of mine and done really well. Yes to all of it.

After drooling over the menu in the hotel room, the few of us that arrived early on the first night decided to get an early dinner at Yardbird.  The restaurant is very dimly lit, and has a cute sort of rustic meets mod decor.  Old southern clips (lots of Elvis) projected on the wall.  

It was so hard to decide on what to get.  Per the waiter's recommendation we ordered our own dishes, but shared.  We got the fried chicken ($27), shrimp and grits ($28), mac n cheese side ($10), and smoked chicken salad ($16).   Food came out quick!  The fried chicken was so moist and golden brown.  They gave us a breast, thigh, wing and drumstick.  It was very flavorful and the honey hot sauce was definitely hot.  The shrimp and grits had lots of plump shrimp and ham.  The grits were creamy and smooth.  The smoked chicken salad was deconstructed.  I told my friend the chicken kind of looked like a big brain!  However, it was very tasty.  The chicken was moist and was placed on top of a fried cornbread with avocado a light dressing and a little bit of frisee.  If you're looking for an actual greens salad, don't get this.  The mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever had.  Super cheesy without being too rich!  

This was pretty much our first meal of the day, so we refrained from over eating and refrained from ordering a drink, so we could drink appropriately later on.  The service and food were great.  It's the Strip so, higher prices are expected; would have liked if my fried chicken came with a little side though, like even a biscuit, but no biggie.  I definitely would come back here again for some more comforting southern food.  I heard they have not only a great dinner, but a great brunch too.

4718933,2018-04-11,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Honestly, I wasn't sure that I wanted to waste time in Vegas on some fried chicken. I mean it's fried chicken for heavens sake. I was born and raised in Georgia and we had fried chicken every Sunday. We were staying in The Venetian and hungry so walked in. We were seated on a couch because they said try didn't have enough servers and were waiting on more to arrive. I didn't mind but they were the kind of couches that if you leaned back you wound up almost reclining. . It was a nice couch for drinking and socializing, but not for eating fried chicken.Our server, Tom Brady ( yes, that's his name) could not have been nicer. We all got the chicken sampler with added fried okra and we also got the deviled eggs. I didn't really want the eggs because every time I order them in a trendy restaurant, I regret it. I make superior eggs at home. My husband loves them so we ordered them. OMG! I can honestly say, I have never had a better deviled egg in my life! Our daughter, the millennial hates eggs but I mom shamed her into trying them and she loved them as well. The chicken was delicious as was the fried okra. My children would only eat two vegetables when growing up and one was okra. ( go figure) They fry it PERFECTLY. We should have just gotten one order of okra because they were not stingy with portion sizes. But we ate every crispy morsel.The homemade hot sauce was seriously drinkable. I didn't care for the biscuits. They weren't bad, but not my moms. Just not fluffy like I'm used to. But I didn't come for bread! Every single person there was extremely nice and we had a wonderful time. My daughter and husband did get flashed by a server wearing no panties, but they were not offended. Just part of the Vegas experience. Lol! They kindly boxed up my leftover chicken breast and some hot sauce which my daughter and I devoured at 3am . My husband's headquarters just relocated to Miami.

4719312,2015-02-02,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"The decor here is really wonderful. Think classic rustic with a beautiful modern twist.
It was like a scene from a movie and the ambiance was perfect. I think this would be a great spot for drinks (they mentioned they might add a live band which would be an added bonus!)

For the food: the best way for me to describe the food is that it's different. It's not your average southern fried chicken joint, they put a twist on everything. 
Also, we tried some of the unusual items that I've never heard of before, we wanted to be adventurous! 


Here is what we ordered:

Quail egg- very good quail (my first time trying that) but it was a little weird nibbling on the bone, it's much smaller that a chicken (obviously) but the meat was tender and juicy.

Pork Croquette- I have to admit, when I saw it come out, I was a little uneasy about it. This is probably the most unusual item I have ever ordered. I only took a small bite and could not stomach the rest. My friend tried more of it and described it as sort of creamy and rich. 

The pork belly BLT - a fried green tomato, house made jam with pimento cheese, pork belly and topped with frisée. This was my second favorite item! It all came together so well and the pork belly was like a thick cut piece of bacon, this is definitely worth ordering.

Watermelon and feta- my most favorite item. They grilled the feta cheese so it was still warm and the watermelon was cold. It was a perfect combination that sent my taste buds into a frenzy! Only 3 pieces came on a plate, so of course we ordered more.

Mango salad- the pecans were smoked, but I think candied pecans would have been better. The salad really missed here and flavors were very underwhelming. 

Deviled eggs: the presentation is the most impressive part! They look so neat with their tiny little layers leading up to the peak. Unfortunately, I thought they were dry and lacked flavor. They didn't seem fresh, it tasted like they had been in the fridge for some time.

All in all, I probably won't be back for the food, but if I am in the area, I might stop by for a drink and some music considering the atmosphere is delightful.",-uk4wYCSmjWz8vH9XkqroA,0,0,3,Lvmd7aja2UbltnJ3S_D-tg

I started with the peach tea cocktail, which was refreshing and reminded me of a Long Island iced tea in a way. We had the fried green tomato BLT which was delicious. It was deep fried and the breading was crispy and the tomato was crunchy. It was topped with frisée, pork belly, and pimento cheese. I'm not a huge fan of pimento but the pork belly mellowed the flavor. We also had the wedge salad which had buttermilk ranch which I enjoyed since I'm not a big blue cheese fan. The roasted corn added a smoky sweet flavor and the avocado on top added creaminess. The fried chicken with waffles and watermelon is a must. The breading on the chicken wasn't as crispy as I hoped, but it was juicy and the hot sauce added a good flavor. The waffle has a cheese crust on top and is nice and crispy.

At first, it doesn't look like your typical southern restaurant because of the decor so therefore I thought it would be an overpriced restaurant on the Strip. But, luckily I was wrong! The concept of the restaurant is family style so everything is meant to be shared. If you come here with a group of 4 or more you'll be solid (under that, just come hungry). The food itself is not heavy or greasy, which is what typical soul food restaurants are known for. 

Everything here was amazing! For sure get the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken is super moist and the homemade Tabasco sauce is excellent. The green fried tomatoes are perfect and that extra piece of pork belly makes it extra amazing. The Mac n cheese is super cheesy.

As most have mentioned, it's a very good idea to make reservations in advance.  I didn't expect it to be so busy on a Monday, but it was packed solid.  My party was seated right across from the open kitchen, which was awesome. I'm a huge foodie and it was quite a sight to see how well-organized and quickly the food went out to customers. 

We had two servers (one was new and being trained and the other was the trainer).  I wish I could remember their names-The new server was from Hawaii and the trainer had tats all up and down his arms.  Both were PHENOMENAL!  Every time they saw our glasses half full, they'd come by to fill it up without us having to ask.  They often stopped by to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything.  

The food was EXCELLENT.  My party (of 3) ordered and shared the cauliflower mashed potatoes, skillet cornbread, kale salad, crispy chicken biscuits, Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken and for dessert, the peach cobbler (they will ask during your order about this specific dessert because it takes time to prepare). Everything came out freshly cooked/made. From our experience, when (not if) we return to Yardbird, we would reorder Lewellyn's Chicken, kale salad, cornbread and try the fried green tomato with pork belly (just couldn't do this dish this time around).  The most surprising dish to us was the peach cobbler-I've had many different cobblers over time and this one tops it.  Many times, cobblers are filled with a lot of gelatinous ingredients to help bind the fruit together.  With this cobbler, I have never spooned up so many fresh peaches with each serving! The scoop of butter pecan ice cream and the twist on top was heaven!  We still talk about this dessert :)

4751056,2016-04-30,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I recently experienced the Yardbird Southern Table & Bar while staying at the Venetian for a conference trip to Las Vegas. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself intrigued me, setup as a half-bar, half-restaurant establishment painted in black but somehow trying to imagine itself as modern southern chic? That is the best way I can describe it, especially considering that there was a projector displaying images of various southern icons on one wall mixed aside barn-style egg baskets hung up by the ceilings. All of this decor would be perfectly fine, if this restaurant actually had food that lived up to its southern-inspired roots. 

After our waitress gave us an incredible overview of their southern fried chicken, I decided to order a southern fried eggs benedict from their brunch menu. Although it was presented nicely, there was something about the chicken that just didn't taste right. It almost seemed like it was slightly undercooked (although it was hard to tell because the mood lighting i the restaurant was very dark). Additionally, the skin was not as crisp as authentic fried chicken that I have had at other restaurants, which of course is the main appeal of fried chicken in the first place. My boyfriend was lured into this restaurant by a burger that promised a pile of brisket, bacon, pork belly, and other meats stacked on top of it. However, when the burger came out there was barely any meat on it and from what I saw there definitely was not any brisket on it (unless the brisket was so thin it couldn't be seen?). 

We were so tired from walking around the strip, that we chose not to waste our energy on complaining about the burger and simply left, full but unsatisfied. I wanted to post this review mainly as a reminder to myself and fellow yelpers that sometimes it really is best to go to certain restaurants according to locale...because apparently this Las Vegas joint was not able to recreate the the food of the American South, despite its best efforts.",GAZZA2IrIDeQkaIPrRik_w,0,1,3,weaKYz2L1Aw6Ml_I2x52zQ

Once seated had a fantastic bloody mary and asked the bartender what his favorite dish was? The biscuits and gravy. Funny, cause that's exactly what I had in mind when I had read the menu online before even walking into the place.

Biscuits, gravy, fried chicken thigh, two poached eggs. Sounds fine in concept.

Until you take a bite. Every iota of flavor from that first bite is still reverberating. This is one of the best things I've ever eaten (definitely in my Top 10) and an immediate addition to my death row meal.

My only disappointment was that this was for brunch only and I wasn't able to get it the rest of the time I was in Vegas.

Next time I'm in Vegas this will be the very first place I go to and the first thing I order. You can count on it.",G6il2wuWAjV7t1GhIutwGA,0,1,5,UoR16cDks8vNkeK73XDLCA

After a short 25 minute wait on a Sunday, we were promptly seated by our friendly hotess in a upscale modern southern themened dining room. We ordered the chicken n' watermelon n' waffles, as well as the Elvis pancakes. 

The chicken is absolutely superb. Probably one of the best I've ever had..and I've had a lot. Super tender, flavorful skin, and the kicker--that hot sauce. Amazing. The pancakes were fluffy and all the fixins (cream, bananas, etc) took it to the next level.

The service? Wow. We unfortunately encountered a piece of fried chicken that was raw (red, bloody raw). But not only did they bring us a fresh dish or chicken, they comped the dish and the manager gave us a very sincere apology.

We made our reservation online and arrived. Got sorted immediately and the menu looks exactly the same as the one in Miami. The ambience was really nice and the decor was perfect as well. 

Must try the BLT Fried Green Tomatoes.. A fried green tomatoes top off with a fat bacon and a touch of greens... so yummy we ordered 2 plates of it. The devils egg is a must to order plate as well.  The flavors and the taste was excellent. The shrimp & grits was so flavorful and cook to perfection. Let's not forget the grits is from Georgia. The chicken & waffles was just perfect.

I went with two other people and we shared some of the small plates/appetizers. The jalapeno corn bread with the butter is so flavorful and just the right amount of jalapeno heat (definitely not spicy) and a very large portion to share. Be warmed: it does have bacon it in but easy to navigate around if you are picky like me. The mac n cheese is totally worth ordering double. We all managed to get 2-3 big scoops of it. The carrots were something different and I'm glad I ordered them. Very flavorful and a bright, fresh dish. The tomoato salad dish was good, but not my favorite out of everything. The tomatos are warm, so it's not a traditional salad but more of a side.

My friends shared the fried chicken plate which came with 4 pieces and a hot sauce. I don't eat meat, so I did not partake, but they were very pleased and the dish is large (so enjoy sharing!). 

I ordered the half sweet, sweet peach tea and it was perfect. Usually sweet teas are TOO sugary, but I'm glad they were able to make it half sweet. 

Unfortunately, I had to rush away because I was going to be late for a show, but I will definitely order their dessert next time. They have a peach cobbler they tell you about before you order that takes about 25-30 minutes. Their other desserts sounded great too and all for about $10 each!

4767548,2016-05-04,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"My friends and I went here for a birthday dinner and it was a pretty good place for a  decent sized party. It's a pretty spacious venue and definitely nicely decorated. They sat our group by the kitchen and most of you would think that being seated there would be annoying but it wasn't. It was fun watching the food getting prepped and such. It definitely was a well oiled machine. Our server was great and all the staff that we encountered were friendly. Now on to the food...

We split four appetizers between 6 people and our server was gracious enough to add to more deviled eggs and biscuits to our order - an order usually comes with 4. 

Deviled eggs - this was delicious. I generally am not a fan of deviled eggs but this was seasoned nicely and the flavor of dill was spot on. 

Kale salad - this dish was okay.  It was lightly dressed, they used baby kale and that's all I really have to say about that.

Mac & cheese - when this item arrived at our table, I wouldn't have thought that it could be split between 6 people. That little mini cast iron sure fed all of us. It was creamy and cheesy and I wanted more. 

Classic buttermilk biscuits - I am also not a fan of biscuits. This however was fluffy, soft and buttery. It also included some butter and jam in cute little jars. Add some of that on the biscuit and darn it, you would want another one. 

On to the entrees. The boyfriend and I decided to share/split two entrees.  He had the St. Louis style pork ribs - we asked for it to be dry and BBQ sauce on the side. He ordered the full rack and that was plenty for two people. The rub had a nice flavor and the meat fell off the bone.  Dip the meat in some sauce and it was even better. I ordered Llewelyn's fine fried chicken. An order came with a thigh, breast, drumstick and wing. Our server told us that it was a good size serving and boy, it was really a good sized serving. Most of the group ordered this and most of us didn't finish it because it was that filling. The chicken was moist and nicely flavored. I think the only thing that we didn't like about it was that the skin wasn't crunchy enough. But this is just a preference. 

Oh we all ordered cocktails/drinks and they have a nice selection. I had the southern peach and it was nice and refreshing. Make sure to order one when you dine here. 

Overall, it was great ambience, the staff was friendly, and the food was great.  Also, if I'm ever around one of these establishments, I would go back.",pCvCL_lQDda2JI0OYTwgvw,0,0,4,l1WsKZaAgOl3vBWN6p6gBA

4772114,2018-03-23,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"The food is really good here, but I'm giving this review 5 stars for the service. My server, Christina R., was the definition of Southern Hospitality. She was so vibrant, social, and full of energy. Christina really made my experience at Yardbird very exceptional. I felt bad that she got scolded by her manager/general manager because I kept wanting the centerpiece in the background of my pictures. I was a bit annoyed when the servers kept taking it away from my table before my food arrived. Luckily, I had an awesome server in Christina who was able to smooth it out with upper management and allowed me to shoot my Chicken N' Waffles N' Watermelon. I had no idea the centerpiece was used as a marker to make sure the table was tended to. That's a cool trick I learned about how they train their staff at Yardbird. 

As for the food, you definitely need to get the Fried Chicken N' Waffles N' Watermelon if this is your first time dining here. This is the second time I've had this dish and I cannot stop raving about the spiced watermelon to my friends. It's one of the best things I've ever had while in Vegas. The chill from the watermelon and spices they dip it in give it this combination of sweetness with a kick at the end. You definitely have to try this. As for the Fried Chicken, it's pretty damn good. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's in my top 5. The breading is crispy and the breast meat is nice and moist. It definitely checks off a lot of boxes when I'm judging fried chicken. And that Bourbon Maple Syrup! Be careful, because you definitely can taste the bourbon in it, but it really goes well with those thick waffles.  

Overall, I had a great experience at Yardbird. I've been here twice and I'm  already thinking about coming back here on my next visit to Vegas. I hear the Shrimp N' Grits is phenomenal, so I think I already know what I'm getting next time. If you can't decide where to eat on Restaurant Row in the Venetian, definitely go to Yardbird for great service and comfort food.",P4h__X3CfQ7knLkoSWNjBQ,7,2,5,fVGbUyYJGxtc553iK02qlw

There was a bit of a wait before a server a checked in on us. Normally I would have already walked out, but my love for Fried Chicken won over my impatience. Our sever Mikayla and the nice gentlemen bussing the tables won us over with their customer service. No easy feat to do with a guest like me.

To start off, we received the biscuits with butter and homemade jam. After tasting this, we automatically agreed to get some to take home. That is all I feel I need to say about that.

We had the wings for our appetizer. Good wings, not overdone and coated in their hot sauce. The hot sauce is straight to the point with a prominent vinegar taste followed by the flavors and heat of the chilies.  

For my entree I had Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, the same chicken is present in the Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. The crust is on the sweet/savory side. I am biased to more salty/peppery crusts, but this coating was still good. The crust was perfectly browned, had a bit of crispness to the exterior, and tender just underneath that crispness. The meat on all the pieces was cooked evenly. Both dark and white meat pieces were tender and juicy through to the bone. Everything you would expect from a temperature controlled deep fryer. I use the word ""juicy"" because several friends have issues with the ""M"" word when referring to something not being dry ;)
  
We had a deep fried Oreo dessert to finish. The coating on the Oreos was creative and the ice cream was good.

No matter what I say, it won't be enough about this place.  My wife and I were in Vegas for our 15th wedding anniversary, and we were staying at the Venetian.  We had already had at least two unfavorable experiences at ""celebrity chef"" restaurants at the Venetian by the time we made it to Yardbird, and ended up finding a new ""must go"" place on future trips.

From the phone conversation for the reservation to departing the restaurant, the service was extremely friendly.  Our second visit we did not have a reservation, but it was early enough that we were able to get in quickly.

The dishes are huge, and the recommendation was that we order items and share them.

First visit  
Server: Courtney, and she was a great server!  Very friendly, made great recommendations, and we had constant refills. 
Food:   (it was ALL good)
- Bourbon Blackberry Lemonade
- Shrimp & Grits
- Charred Okra
- Skillet Cornbread
- Mama's Chicken Biscuits

For dessert, we got the Bacon Butterscotch Cake, and this is a must-try!  We had not even told Courtney that it was our anniversary, but she brought it out on a plate that the kitchen had personalized for our anniversary, so the hostess must have told her.  It was a great surprise!

Second Visit
Server:  Jonathan
Food:
- Chicken, watermelon, and waffles 
- Whipped Sweet Potatoes
- Mac & Cheese - so awesome.

On this visit I saw the restaurant manager (Greg-- great customer service person!) coming by, and I stopped him to tell him how much we really enjoyed both visits.  He thanked us for having such kind things to say, and then before we even got around to ordering dessert he personally brought us the Deep Fried Oreos (again, another personalized decorated plate) and a Bourbon milkshake that was so good it's beyond words, and both free of charge.

Parking: Free parking

Wait: If you want a booth make reservations. We walk up on Saturday morning and the wait was 1 and 1/2. But lucky they had the bar area ready so we share a table with a party of 6. 

Food: We had the biscuits, chicken n waffle, and pancakes with 2 coffee. 

Likes: The biscuits was good with the butter and Jam.

Dislike: The chicken n waffle were very disappointing. It was 36 dollars and a total waste of money. On the menu it says the chicken is cooked for 21 hours and that justified the price. Save your money and go to Gritz Cafe, Strip n Dip, or Hash Hash A Go Go if you want bomb.com fried chicken.The waffle was plain, nothing special, and the bourbon syrup was nasty. They do have regular syrup, but unfortunately I poured the bourbon syrup on half of the waffle. The pancakes were meh. 

Service: The waitress was helpful and check in on us, which I appreciated.

Speaking of the service - all was great - just the right amount of menu advice, checking in, water filling, etc.  Excellent service.  The only suggestion we have for Yard Bird....stop charging $2.00 for large ice cubes.   It is an unwelcome surprise and seems rather chintzy for a restaurant that is so outstanding in every other way, not to mention it is just fabulous fodder for social media.  How about just averaging the cost in to the price of the drink and ask people what they prefer without the hidden cost.

Review 7 months ago: The waffle and chicken meal was tasteful, but the cost for the meal is a bit pricey. The price for the meal is $36 dollars. My husband and I shared the meal, but decided to buy sides to balance the meal out. Each side is another $10 dollars.

We definitely drew the short straw with our server, who clearly didn't like his job, and acted like he barely tolerated us. He pushed a few menu items, and then completely vanished- no coming back to check on us, or anything. My friend had ordered biscuits that never arrived, and I had an issue with my meal, so we had to flag someone down to find him. We never saw him again after that. Absolutely lousy service.

I started with a Georgia Peach cocktail, which was weak to the point of just tasting like a juice drink. They had a good beer selection, so that would have been a better choice. We shared the deviled eggs, which were excellent, and definitely the best thing we both ate.

As for my meal, I originally ordered shrimp and grits, a dish that I usually love. The grits were the lumpiest, gummiest, most awful grits I have ever been unlucky enough to receive. They had the texture of cottage cheese, and having lived in the South, I can tell you that is a cardinal sin of Southern cooking. Although the shrimp was fine, the dish as a whole was inedible. 

To his credit, the manager came right over to address the situation, comped us an order of biscuits, and made other menu suggestions. I ended up ordering the fried chicken, which was enjoyable, although I wasn't a fan of the sauce. And frankly, a $20+ price point for a la carte fried chicken is a bit much to take. On a positive note, the biscuits were hot and fresh, so they were a nice addition to the meal.

I can't say I'd recommend Yardbirds, and with all of the dining options in Las Vegas, I won't be returning.",ptYMVF9IjRsNRTji6-pd2A,1,0,3,acG9cdFtLq_EDpSN3-ZnGg

Best fried chicken on the planet.
Yes it is finger licking good all because of the seasoning and the way its cook to thier style unique way of perfection I can taste. Nothing too chewy also have to appreciate the waitress and servers help on our journey of deliciousness.
Number one favorite appetizer was the mac and cheese with brisket. Mac and cheese was on point. Flavorful and tons of brisket inside which was truly amazing way worth it type of feel and deal. Mouth watering stomach growling for more. Best mac and cheese ever I've ever tried. Tasteful cheese other then other mac and cheeses out there. The fried green tomato pork belly appetizer was pretty good I'd get it again. 
We also had the peach cobbler, And corn bread bestest in the westest hands down. This is my go to place if I ever want some fried chicken and Mac N cheese. And other delicious dishes. The only thing I didn't like was the pork belly mAc and cheese.Came out. Little stiff on the pork belly meat wasn't as soft and mouth melting but that's fine I'll stick to the brisket. But yeah the peach cobbler is  a must if you love PEACHES. I'm thinking about getting the fried bacon donuts next time. I can go on and on. Great customer friendly service ever. Thank you yard bird for being incredibly delicious hands down best of the best.",s5EdF0eQEM0NWTFFEIe0ew,1,0,5,Gv8cmEYVXQtpOmzPRSqz2A

We were sat down at a nice square table that was set with a cute blue plate, napkin and silverware. The servers offered water; sparkling, bottled, or tap. We chose tap because we aren't too pickey about our water. I will say it was very nice how quickly they are to refill the water glass. As soon as I put my glass down someone was there to fill it up. The special of the day was biscuits and gravy with a piece of their fried chicken and all topped with an egg. I decided on the special with my egg cooked over medium and also ordered a side of the spiced watermelon, I LOVE watermelon and this is one of the things I was looking forward to the most. Silly, I know. And to drink, I choose the blackberry bourbon lemonade. The biscuits were SO good, they were square, not too thick and had the perfect amount of gravy. The chicken was so moist and delicious and the egg was cooked just perfect. Now, the watermelon, it was stacked up like a pyramid and was dressed with lime juice, mint, and cayenne pepper. I could probably live off that watermelon!!! My blackberry bourbon lemonade was delicious as well, it had a nice garnish of a lemon slice and blackberry, it was the perfect mix of sweet blackberry and lemon but not too overpowering.

Macaroni and cheese: fridge rent types of pasta! Macaroni, shell, swirly. Cheesy and thick! Served in a great black pot with a lid! Presentation reminds you of chum good Mac and cheese! 

Deviled eggs: a tower of deviled eggs!! Comes in 4  half pieces! Good! Chives sprinkled on top! Texture is less creamy compared to other deviled eggs. More textured 

Classic buttermilk biscuits: comes with two cute small jars with butter and apple marmalade!! Served hot and fresh wrapped in a white cloth. Crispy and hot. Soft in the inside. Delicious! 

Lewellyn's fine fried chicken: pretty good! But I have to say, Popeyes is still way better! Not as flavorful and moist in the inside as advertised 

Short rib: comes with delicious delicious corn! Green beans are so good! Mashed potatoes are soft and fluffy! Short ribs are stringy and tender and flavorful. Light mild sweet BBQ taste 

Peach cobbler: this was my FAVORITE from the whole meal! FRESHLY BAKED so it was a bit of a wait but so delicious! Hot fresh lightly sweet peach baked with a crispy wafer aligned connecting it to the French vanilla ice cream scoop served in a sugar edible bowl! BOMB! 

Pros: 
-no wait during dinner prime time 
-good service! Manager came to check up on us

Yardbird is a great place to go to remind me of living there and traveling to the states around me. On this visit I had the deviled eggs, which I can't go without having, and I tried the burnt ends.  I usually get shrimp and grits, but that would have been too much food so I just got grits. My husband got a bacon cheese burger, because you just can't get too much bacon. They put little black caviar in the deviled eggs which really makes them taste unique. The angus steak burnt ends were mixed with some spicey red  peppers which really made those grits come in handy. The grits weren't as creamy as the ones that you get with shrimp and grits, but they did help tame the spiciness of the burnt ends. I did enjoy the meal. I think I would have enjoyed creamier grits, but I was full and that is what mattered to me at the time. I wonder what I should try next time?",i4V7LuukG-pH_PAUmszBiw,2,2,5,wQSXM2zF-a7GFFREP0rSLw

4844146,2016-11-26,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Read a local blog that Yardbird was offering a Thanksgiving menu and booked reservations for myself and my mom. Im so glad I did. This was a great experience all around, from the hostess, to the server and the food. We basically stuck with Thanksgiving option, except with ordering the deviled eggs and a dessert that was on the regular menu.

Let's start with the deviled eggs. Perfect! Presentation was great. Flavor was phenomenal. I opted to have the ""trout roe"" (aka fish eggs) on the side as I was not sure how this was going to taste. And if you are kind of ""freaked out"" by fish eggs, dont be. The smokeyness adds an extra flavor. And our server brought out a side of what was comparable to a wing sauce to dip in. This as well added an extra flavor.

Our main course was the Thanksgiving special. This consisted of the ""Turkey Duo Plate"" with chicken fried turkey, smoked turkey leg, cauliflower mash, green beans, cranberry dressing and a cornbread muffin. This definitely did not disappoint. The fried turkey was great. Perfect amount of breading and the turkey was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes along with the gravy were great. Could have been a tad bit creamier, but that's just me. The green beans were actually a tradition green bean casserole. And the cranberry dressing served as a base in which the mashed potatoes and one of the cutlets sat on. A great combination of foods.

And dessert was a pumpkin cheesecake. This was a little more than a typical cheesecake. It had a slice of what could have possibly been a piece of pumpkin cake. The cake portion could have been a little bit more moist, but the cheesecake portion was great. This also came with some pumpkin seed brittle. This could have been left off. It was a little nasty. But luckily I was able to move the pieces away.

I definitely want to come back to try what else is on their menu. Thanks for the great meal!",K3xpTUT83MJttC0WesGHWg,1,0,5,Re4CdSBRqUT67yvnKrjMXQ

Our party ordered their famous fried chicken, biscuits & gravy and brisket sliders to share amongst everyone. We also ordered mac and cheese along with their corn bread to pair with our entrees. The fried chicken was served hot out of the fryer and it was absolutely delicious! I believe our waiter mentioned their chickens are brined for 27 hours which explains the moistness behind every bite. The skin wasn't as crunchy as I expected but it was still nonetheless flavorful and good. The biscuits with gravy and eggs was a bit... messy. The egg was cooked over easy and the yolk sort of made everything else on the dish a little soggy. I know most people probably enjoy the combination of biscuits, chicken and eggs mixture; it was just a bit too much for me. The corn bread was good, but I definitely had better. The Mac and cheese was creamy, but it could have used a little more cheddar cheese to add that sharpness flavor to it. 

Overall, I really had a good dining experience here and would recommend others to try this place out. Really cool ambiance with couches and love sofas available for seating. They also have a full bar if you wanted to just chill and have a drink with your friends.

Great, friendly, educated staff will cover all your questions with recommendations. Nice open casual floor plan.
THE FOOD,
So many items we wanted to try, but portions are big so we had to tread lightly to avoid dozing off in a Foodie coma for the show we were catching afterwards.
APPS--We split..we LOVED :
-Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad
char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, tomatoes, red onion, benne seed vinaigrette.
-Classic Buttermilk Biscuits (4 of them)---best I ever had..even better than in SC and GA!...............served with honey butter, house-made jam
ENTREE-
We both had one of their signature dishes......
-- Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles-
with honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, Vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup.....at $36\plate..it's not cheap for fried chicken..but is was some of the best I've ever had and a whole 1\2 chicken to boot..the contrast in flavors made them all a perfect match...gotta get all 3 in one BIG BITE!
waiter also suggested:
-Short Rib-with
cabernet braised, charred corn, green beans, sweet garlic bordelaise, cauliflower mashed potatoes
--Skillet Cornbread-with
Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon,jalapeño, honey maple butter.

skipped dessert although they sounded amazing.

I had the Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad and my boyfriend had the Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken. Our waiter was super patient with us and recommended dishes for me since I was feeling something lighter. I went with his recommendation of the chicken salad and it surely was light enough! The sauce at the bottom was a bit on the salty end, but I wasn't sure if my taste buds were off that day because I was recovering from being sick. I did love the salad on top and the avocado bits at the bottom that was refreshing. The chicken was thinly striped so that each bite was just the perfect amount and flavor. My boyfriend had hot sauce on the side with his fried chicken, and he gave me the insides of the fried chicken, and boy was that chicken juicy!

We definitely got too much fried chicken (and wish our server could have told us, because we had no place for leftovers in the hotel room). The Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken comes 4 in a plate, and they are huge. The skin is perfectly crispy! I'd also recommend the Crispy Brussel Sprouts, the sweet, caramelized honey pairs perfectly with the savory (and spicy - if you use the hot sauce) fried chicken!

The chicken, waffles and watermelon had really good and juicy. The waffles tasted really fresh and had a nice sweet taste to it. The waffle was made really well and I like the watermelon a lot. Each piece was a good solid cube (they chose good watermelon or the good parts of the watermelon) and has nice spice that compliments the sweetness well.

Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just yum.  The fried chicken was the best I've ever had, so much flavor, moist all the way through, and best of all not greasy.  It was, dare I say, perfect.  We decided to get the butterscotch cake with the bacon frosting for dessert.  It was a huge portion.  It was really tasty, I don't think we were able to eat half of it.  Definitely one to share.  I would highly recommend this place, and already have to several people.",stc-jP_scMIlleVr_OP1YA,0,0,5,InrURNmqMOxQ6bsPEkz21w

4909088,2015-02-15,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"As a bona fide southerner living in Las Vegas, this place was a vast disappointment. I was prepared to pay too much for fried chicken, but my expectation was that they would keep it authentic. The chicken was raw, and when we complained to the waiter he said it was because it was brined. We've had brined chicken before, many times. This was raw. He didn't remove it from the bill, as most good servers at most good restaurants would offer to do. He didn't care that it was Valentine's Day and we had a bad experience. 

We had the charred okra, which sounded promising but was soggy. The grilled romaine had barely any dressing and was overpowered by the anchovy croutons. 

The chicken liver toast was the best thing we ate, but it would have been better on crusty bread instead of limp bread. 

I can say only two good things about this place: 1) the wines by the glass selection was good. Most restaurants get that wrong--they did a good job. 2) the music they play is the only authentic thing about this place.

Careless and thoughtless service. Limp, under-seasoned vegetables, raw fried chicken.

Southerners--stay away. Anyone not from the South--stay away. There's better in Vegas for less money, like M&M Soul Food.",0KTtZhV3RAj-lUEg3MKudQ,2,1,2,HpOFLCEx2iOPTjtY5j0_MA

My boyfriend and I were in Vegas and decided to have lunch here. Because we were having a late lunch and were going to eat shortly, we decided to split our dishes. Glad we did. The portion size chicken&waffles&watermelon was extremely generous. We were both full for hours after. We shared a side of biscuits and fries. They were both delicious. We just couldn't come out of the chicken's amazingness. It was absolutely perfect. No wonder they were best known for this. Yes, some will find the dish expensive. Heck as a young, newly college grad professional, I definitely found it pricey. But worth it. I would come back here every single time I'm in Vegas from now on. That's how much I am obsessed.

Service was absolutely amazing. Our waiter was attentive and fast. Whenever we needed something, he was there. When he was busy and we needed, say water refill, he made sure another waiter was there to refill our glass. Our food arrived probably 5 minutes after we ordered. I was shocked.

Chicken was fried perfectly - the crust was probably my favourite out of all the fried chicken that I've tried. The server asked whether I preferred white or dark meat - I opted for the dark meat for more flavour.

Whenever we visit Las Vegas and stay at the Venetian, a portion of one night is always dedicated to the Yardbird.  Legitimate upscale comfort food is at its best here.  From the decor details to the menu options, the southern warmth shines through.  The friendly staff helps round out the experience.  More on that later.

This time around, we went with a few classics that included Lewellyn's Fried Chicken, the Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes, and the Macaroni and Cheese.  Good thing I do not live in Las Vegas, otherwise I would be here too often.    

The fried chicken is hearty, flavorful, and the meat is cook perfectly...not too dry.  You will not be disappointed with the crispy and tasty outer layer.  Most of us have had our share of mashed potatoes, but the cauliflower mashed potatoes are delectable.  The cauliflower and spices used in the mashed potatoes exceeds any level of gourmet potato dish you might have experienced.  The macaroni and cheese is cheesy and hot with a very slight crust.  All of this was washed down with a classic 24 ounce original Coors and a Moscow Mule.  The Moscow Mule was one of the best I have ever had.

In regards to the service, it consistently exceeds the standard.  Each time I have had the pleasure of dining at the Yardbird, our waitstaff has been excellent.  They know the menu and make very good recommendations.  Consider making and keeping a reservation on the weekends to ensure your spot at the Yardbird.

4924677,2017-04-20,6,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"We saw this restaurant was popular and had good ratings on yelp, so we made a brunch reservation during our stay in Vegas. The hours of operation and location were also very convenient and fit our schedule. Let's get down to what we ordered...

BAR MENU: all drinks came in these cute mason jars. 

Southern Peach - I got this because as I was reading the menu description, it sounded like something I would like. It was a cocktail with lemon, thyme, peach, and sweet tea. However, don't know if it was the aperol or the whiskey...but the whole drink was too strong for me. I guess it's due to the fact that I'm not a heavy drinker at all. I couldn't really enjoy or finish it as much as I would have liked.

Southern Revival - This one claimed to be a Yardbird favorite and was a mixture of whiskey, passion fruit and basil. I took a sip and the taste was too potent for me. My taste buds couldn't handle the sweet and sourness of this one and my tablemate ended up ordering another drink in replacement since she didn't really like it either. She ended up getting The Porkchop and liked that one much better and gave the Revival to our other tablemate.

BRUNCH MENU: we ordered and split some appetizers and the main entrees.

Deviled Eggs - Maybe it was my stomach that day but having cold eggs first thing in the morning didn't sit well with me. The eggs were delicious, however I wasn't a fan.

Fried Green Tomato BLT - I enjoyed this a bit better than the eggs. The pork belly was crisp and the flavorings from the cheese, tomatoes and vinaigrette complimented each other very well.

Classic Buttermilk Biscuits - I don't really care for biscuits and everyone was saying we shouldn't have ordered them because we ended up having too much food that we couldn't finish. The biscuits were alright, nothing special. I did like the house-made jam that came with it though.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles - definitely order this as a main entrée. I've never had anything like the chilled spiced watermelon that came with the chicken. It was SOOOO good. The waffles were different too, but I wish I had tried the cheddar cheese waffle WITHOUT the syrup first cause once you mix them - the taste is very interesting. I didn't hate it nor did I like it. All in all I liked this dish the most out of everything we ordered.

Shrimp 'n' Grits - I've never had grits before so this was a new experience for me. I would describe it as oatmeal - it was okay. I couldn't get over the texture and I kept thinking about it as I was chewing so that probably caused me to not particularly enjoy it. I did like the shrimp it came with, they were delicious, just no to the grits for me.

I don't remember the name of our server, but she was very friendly and nice. Upon knowing that it was my first time in Vegas, she started suggesting all these things for me to do and see. It seemed like she really wanted to make my experience here as fun and as enjoyable as possible, so I really appreciated that she went out of her way to do that.

After reading tons of Yelp reviews about ""deviled eggs"" I figured it was only right I order them... Perhaps all the delicious eggs went to the Easter bunny because my order was terrible. The presentation was lovely but the filling taste as if it sat out a while. Opposite of moist. Aside from that small hiccup everything else was perfection.

Yardbird has a lofty reputation and as a result, our expectations were high.  Yardbird lived up to its considerable hype.  We had lunch at Yardbird on a Friday afternoon.  There were 3 of us and we were able to walk right in.  I liked the joint, especially the random pictures of Cash, Elvis, Bob Dylan, etc. that were cycling through on the wall.

We were approached fairly quickly by a server to take our drink orders.  Good beer list, decent wine list.  It was a little early for me so I went with a housemade lemonade.  As expected, a restaurant that specializes in southern fare makes fantastic lemonade.  It's $6 a glass, and I do not know if that comes with refills since I did not get one.  If you don't get refills that's a hefty price for lemon juice, water, and sugar, even when the mixture is as good as this.  

The 3 of us split the chicken and waffles, chicken biscuits, fries, mac and cheese, and coleslaw.  You may bristle at $36 for the famous chicken, watermelon, and waffles, but it was a lot of food.  You get 4 pieces of chicken plus a large serving of watermelon and the thick waffle.  The food comes out QUICK.  As in, within 5 minutes of us ordering it.  I guess when you have something as labor intensive as fried chicken as the star of the show you just constantly make batches of it.  But, it did not suffer in quality.  This chicken was definitely fresh, it had not been sitting under a salamander prior to its arrival at our table.

I had the breast and thigh of the chicken.  Both were juicy and flavorful, but the dark meat was better.  The skin is crunchy and seasoned very well.  No need for additional salt and pepper.  The chicken is just good quality fried chicken.  Is it the best I've ever had?  Probably not, but it is damn good and I didn't have any qualms about the price.

The waffle has a nice slight crunch to it and a chewy center.  Paired with the bourbon maple syrup it was very good.  Paired with the chicken it was great.  We had to ask for more syrup, the waffle to syrup ratio was off due to the size of the waffle.  The spiced watermelon didn't land with any of us.  It was okay, and it's good quality watermelon.  We just did not love it.

The sides, in order of preference:  mac and cheese, fries (with bacon ranch that they should bottle and sell), and cole slaw.  The slaw was good, its served with a crisp of chicken skin, but it couldn't compare to the mac and cheese.  This stuff was creamy and incredibly flavorful.  We all loved it.

The chicken biscuits were another winner.  The flavorful chicken on a flaky biscuit with some very good pepper jelly was a strong combination.

It took me awhile to get to Yardbird after its opening.  I will not wait so long next time, and will likely return on my next trip to Vegas.  Highly recommended.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,2,5,-SHiKWjZ7ErtW8_hE8oa5A

We came across this restaurant just by yelping the nearest place to us (turns out it was literally like 200 feet from us lol). Southern food seemed like a good place to take a break and refill ourselves before continuing our weekend festivities. 

We got seated down immediately and the servers were quick and friendly. My friends and I all ordered different things to try and share. The cornbread with the honey and butter were delicious! You gotta try this dish. The mac n cheese was also to die for. I had to try the fried chicken too, of course. It was fried to perfection! So crispy on the outside, tender and falls off the bone on the inside. The flavor was on point too.

Despite this, and that the mangoes tasted previously frozen, I thought the salad was refreshing and a bit more substantial than the one at Public House. Hard to choose which I preferred since they are so different, but I gravitated towards the beet salad at Public House.

It's really good eats here... if it was the Olympics and this was 1976.... gold-medal-10s across the board-- Nadia Comaneci good. This place is a stupendous. 

The skillet cornbread was the best ever and serving it in an iron skillet was awesome and it was crispy but not dried out; it's a little spicy though. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the best fried chicken I've tasted ever. The ribs were fall-of-the-bone delicious and nothing short of irreproducible. Dry rub and no need for a table-side BBQ sauce bath. With and without sauce, still amazing. The coleslaw had a citrus twang that I miss already.

Ambiance could be a bit noisy--likely the patrons k'velling over the food. More likely though, incoming calls from prisons across the world, with last meal requests pouring in. [For those prone to political bristle,re-lax...the last meal before being.....re-leased. Ok.] You might need to raise your voice a tad and strain  your ear to hear every so often. Lighting was subdued but not dark, it was nice to not have to request a flashlight. 

The food was so good, that I got an order to go, stored in the hotel refrigerator, and brought it right onto the plane next day. I was careful to mark the styrofoam with my name on it. It took my last scintilla of self control to not retrieve it from the overhead storage mid flight and chomp it down right then and there. The pleasant vapors of BBQ wafting throughout the cabin, and throng of passengers Pavlov'ing didn't make said restraint easy.

Fried green tomato BLT - do it! The pimento cheese is perfect and the tomatoes are well done.
Kale salad with Vermont cheddar, apples raisins and balsamic. It's a good salad and perfectly fresh. Ours was a bit over dressed. Perhaps ask for dressing on the side?
Chicken biscuit sliders with pepper jelly - the idea is delicious. The combination, however, was dry. The tenders were the primary dryness culprit.
Cocktail- southern revival. I despise grapefruit but this has changed my view. It's dangerous, addictive, and refreshing. Highly recommend.
We ordered extra pepper jelly and it fixed its chewability. The pepper jelly is sweet with a small kick at the back.

In regards to the food, it was great. I normally never eat deviled eggs because I just don't think it's worth it but the ones here are amazing. You can really taste the dill and the smoke salmon roe on top adds a nice touch.

I ordered the fried chicken without the waffles. While the fried chicken wasn't bad due to the crunch and the brining, I think what really makes this place good are the sauces.

We got into town late-ish, and we were starving by the time we were checked into our hotel room. Hotel propaganda and Yelp steered us toward Yardbird, even though they told us over the phone that they were ""fully committed"" and we'd probably have to sit in the lounge area. 

When we arrived at the restaurant, the hosts offered to put us on the waitlist for a table, which was a nice surprise. But we were hungry, so we grabbed a sofa in the lounge area and ordered food there. A table actually opened up not long after we sat down, but we had more friends join us, so we stayed at the couches were there was plenty of space.

To drink, I had the blackberry bourbon lemonade, which was exceptional. Strong, refreshing, and well-balanced. For food, I ordered the fried chicken and a side of cool ranch cucumber salad. Let me just say that the chicken was amazing. I've never had fried chicken that tasted quite like this, as the seasonings were very unique. But it worked well, and the chicken was exceptionally juicy and crispy. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Definitely one of the best chicken dishes I've had in my life. The tongs provided to help with breaking down the chicken were a game-changer. The cucumber salad was disappointing. It was pretty bland, and reminded me more of eating applesauce than of cool ranch dressing. I got this because the waitress recommended it, but looking back, any of the other sides probably would've tasted better.

Service here was great. Since we were seating in the lounge area and not the main dining area, we weren't expecting full service. But our waitress was super attentive and helpful. We ordered a lot of food, and she was quite skilled at arranging all the plates to fit on the tiny cocktail tables. 

I was taken aback by how pricy the chicken was, especially considering it doesn't come with anything on the side. It's definitely enough food to share, but sharing limits the amount of dishes you get to try. Be prepared to spend about $50 for an appetizer, chicken, and side. The chicken did taste amazing, though.",amKuvJtW35lBe0o265H62A,1,0,4,Ok7X65WZwjWWtWmfNAfVlA

That being said the menu was fun and the chopped salad was delicious with a nice kick of spice. However the fried chicken was very forgettable but clearly was the number one choice of all diners.  I would recommend ordering anything but the chicken.  I would still give this place another try but with all the options Vegas has to offer it probably won't happen   Go to Bouchon instead",_VHWQ1e7srKx00hdfPBISw,0,0,3,PrxDWJI8ZBf8PSQG5cDKFA

We didn't make reservations in advance, which was very poor planning on our part as the restaurant was packed with brunch-seekers.  We put our names on the waitlist for a table, but were fortunate to be able to be seated in the lounge.  The Yardbird staff throughout our visit was exemplary, especially our server (unfortunately, I didn't get her name) who initially took care of us after we were seated in the lounge, won me over big time with incredible hospitality and service by securing us another coffee table and chair to accommodate our group of six while taking and delivering our drink order.  As luck would have it, a large table came available in the dining room and we were able to be reseated at a much more functional location for our party.  

We shared a couple of orders of the Deviled Eggs ($10) for the table.  They were delicious with the salmon roe giving them a nice visual, textural, and flavor pop.  The wife and I shared an order of their signature Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles ($36).   Each of the three pieces of chicken we received was perfectly fried, but more importantly, internally moist and juicy.  The waffle was nicely savory as it was infused with sharp cheddar cheese.  The bourbon-infused maple syrup was a perfect topping for the savory waffles.  While it was a pricey dish, it was easily the best version of chicken and waffles that I've ever had.  Yardbird isn't a great place to bring children, but my wife's friend's children seemed to really enjoy their mac 'n cheese.  

I'd equate Yardbird Southern Table & Bar to Southern ""fine-dining"".  It was truly an enjoyable meal and a solid place for brunch.

Nearly all staff I encountered was hospitable and proud of where they were and what they were serving!  Sadly, the terse, disinterested staff at the host stand (a critical part of the visit) delivered an absolutely incompetent experience on TWO consecutive visits.  

*  Welcome Experience
-  Shameful

I was excited to approach Yardbirds!  I had read great things and was eager for this new experience.  I approached the front desk where three staff and no customers were standing.  I waited for what was definitely too long to be acknowledged in some way - I wasn't.  I asked one of the three, ""am I in the right place for us to be seated?"" - that idle person said, ""yes but we are working on something.""  

Hmm.  All three of you?  Working so diligently that eye contact and acknowledgment was out of the question?  You shouldn't be in your role if some elementary multitasking (across three staff) is out of question.  So the four of us were a bit put off, and started discussing other options.  (After all, the place is teeming with competitors right?)

I was finally asked (without eye contact) ""how many?""  I gave my response and was seated.  The demeanor and interaction with the front desk staff was awful.  I take a minute to describe the experience because it's an easy fix - move the people who hate their job to another job - find someone with a modicum of hospitality to greet your patrons.

*  Establishment
-  Outstanding

This place was very cool!  Unique, modern decor, comfortable seating and lots of interesting features that made for a good experience!  It was very clean and the decor was consistent throughout!  They spared no expense!

*  Service
-  Awful at first thanks to the ""hosts""
-  Outstanding after that thanks to the servers who were warm, personable, attentive and kind.  

*  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
-  Outstanding!!  (See photos)

During my two visits I tried:

Kale Salad with Shrimp - extraordinary!  How did they cook that shrimp??  It was PERFECT, with a well balanced salad that was delicious to the last bite!  My favorite thing about it was the seasoning and cook on the shrimp.  

Fried Chicken Sandwich - extraordinary!  (Although the quiet and bored runner who brought it to me should have enthusiastically told me about the honey-infused crystal hot sauce and stuff, but she just mumbled something and walked away.  A runner for the table next door did a great job and I overheard their pitch). The chicken was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and surrounded by a soft warm potato bun.  I can't stop dreaming about it!

Biscuit with Ham / Vermont Cheddar - extraordinary!  A soft, warm biscuit with melted sharp white Vermont cheddar and sliced ham.  Ugh I need it again!!

Biscuit with Pulled Pork - extraordinary!  The quality of the biscuits is outstanding and the soft, warm pulled pork and pickles onions were just so good.  

French fries with Bacon Salt - great!  Probably the most ordinary thing of the bunch.  The bacon salt was sparse, definitely needed more...

Salted Caramel Bread Pudding - OMG I HATE how good this was.  This brick of tender, delicious bread pudding sitting in a puddle of creme anglaise next to a dollop of house made whipped cream topped with salty sweet candies nuts was absolutely absurd.  I'll visit yardbirds every time I visit Vegas just for this.  

Butterscotch Cake - outstanding!  Creamy rich frosting, moist cake drizzled with (something) with some ice cream on the plate.  I wanted more buttery butterscotch (the flavor wasn't bold) but it was still delicious!

Peach Cobbler - honestly - meh.  The menu says it takes about 30 min to bake this fresh.  We waited.  It was hot and bubbly, but the peach filling was just ok, and the crust was just ok - to me.  My friend who grew up in New Orleans raved about it and loved every bite.

You must give this place a try.  Unique cocktails, extraordinary food and quite a nice atmosphere once you get past the gatekeepers who seemed like they were a third party staff disconnected from the rest.  Owners - you gotta fix that!  Imagine if you had hospitable, personable people at that desk who didn't act like they hate their job??

Staff was really attentive and smiley. They seem to really enjoy their jobs. 

Reservations recommended. We got here for a late lunch around 1pm and there was a 45 min wait. 

Four stars only bc the location doesn't adequately showcase this restaurant's charms. It's located in Restaurant Row in the Venetian and has a big open view of all the foot traffic. The hip atmosphere doesn't quite match the homey food; I wish it was more conducive to chilling and enjoying. Maybe try for a seat in back where you don't see the people walking by and peeking in.

Because we had a party of 12, a dinner reservation before 9pm required a huge deposit/commitment. Thankfully, they allowed us to make a commitment-free reservation as long as we made our reservation after 9pm.

They had a private room set up for us. Despite us being separated from the rest of the restaurant, we were still given great service throughout dinner. I was dehydrated from the heat and drinking outside by the pool all afternoon, so I drank a ton of water - the waiter must have refilled my drink at least five times, but each time was prompt and I never had an empty glass.

The food: shared the shrimp and grits and the fried green tomato BLT. Shrimp and grits were just alright. It was decent but I've definitely had better elsewhere - I prefer my grits to be cheesier and softer.

The fried green tomato BLT was definitely the winner of the night. It was fried perfectly and not too greasy, and the bacon was savory and not overcooked.

Tried some chicken and waffles from another part of the table - decent but I'm glad I got the other dishes instead.

Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a decent place to eat on the Strip. They also have an extensive selection of whiskey - wish I could have taken advantage, but I was already drinking all day and night in between!

5049210,2018-06-21,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Overall: chicken and waffles are overpriced, great southern food, a little dark inside

I had seen some reviews and photos of this place so we decided to give it a shot. I saw chicken and waffles on the menu so we had to go for it! 

Ambiance: 
The restaurant is VERY dark, which threw us off, especially for lunch. I understand that's the atmosphere at some places but this was a little too dark for our liking. 

Pricing:
They specialize in southern cuisine, so we tried the biscuit plate as well as the chicken and waffles and watermelon (all one dish). The pricing here was a little off. There is a dish that is 2 pieces of fried chicken with a biscuit side for $15, and the chicken and waffles were $36 for only 2 tiny wings more of chicken. Unless you MUST have the waffles, I say go for the other dish because the chicken and waffles were just a little pricey for how much food it was. 

Flavors: 
 The chicken was perfectly cooked. Crispy outside, moist on the inside, and lots of flavor. The biscuits were very flaky and moist, and it came with a soft honey butter (I LOVE soft butter). We did have to ask for more butter though because the size of butter they gave us was just not enough for 4 decent sized biscuits. The watermelon was nice as well but I'm not sure it was really needed, I would have a bite of chicken with a waffle but never with the watermelon. Plus the seasoning on the chicken kind of spread to the watermelon which wasn't my favorite thing either. The food was great overall though.

The service was nice. For some reason, we didn't get the fried chicken this might've been the downfall of this review. 

We got - 
Lobster dip - it was tasty and creamy but almost had no lobster in it.  It appeared to be served in a large crock but it was barely a quarter inch deep. It was the first time I've ever ordered a dip in a restaurant that had more chips/ bread than dip.

Dessert was the Maple Bacon frosted butterscotch cake.  I could have licked the plate.  The cake was not overly sweet and was perfect way to end the meal.  

For not being a kid ""friendly"" restaurant aka no kids menu they do have small plates which in my mind was the same or even better than having a kids menu.  The staff was amazing with our daughter.

Sister and I came here for a random Monday night dinner and it was fantastic from the service to the food. 

We started with some Crispy Chicken Biscuits (delicious but you only get two) and a couple of drinks. She had and loved their Watermelon Sling cocktail, which is made with fresh watermelon juice and White Whiskey. I went with a White Horse Ale beer also good.

For our ""supper"" she went with the Swine Burger which I didn't taste but she enjoyed and honestly looked like one hell of a burger. Was pleasantly surprised and disappointed (lol) she even finished it. I went with famous Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. This was a tough decision since I'm not much of a fried chicken fan (besides wings) but it ended up being a great decision. Chicken was cooked perfectly and still very moist inside, waffles were good not very heavy just the way I like them, the watermelon at the end was an excellent refresher. This was the first time I had ever ordered chicken and waffles and now I understand the love for them.

We finished the night with their Chocolate Nutella Cake which was the best and most amazing part of the entire meal.

The web address says it all.   Bye bye Mr. Clucky.  

Yardbird is a farm to table eatery serving up prettied up versions of Southern classics in a loud, jovial, communal environment.   True to it's Southern roots, there isn't a thing healthy about the food.  All the fat and fried goodness one expects.  It translates to flavor and that's a good thing.

To our fine, feathered, friends, from the beginning, the deviled eggs.  The simple 70's starter brought to the 21st century with the addition of trout roe mixed into the yolky filling.  Good textural contrast, the brininess adds complexity to what is usually a boring dish. 

The other standout starter, the chicken liver toast.  Similar to the Italian counterpart, enriched with butter and fat, spread over grilled bread and topped with a fresh, pepper relish.  Earthy, minearly...oh heck, its just good eats.

Moving along, do not pass on Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken.  Chickeny free ranged meat picking up moisture from a long brine, perfectly cooked to crispy perfection.  The slight spice of the crust accentuating the natural sweetness of the bird.  The accompanying honey hot sauce is excellent.  Might not be for the purist but it's good.  Take the same chicken and serve it up in a flaky, moist buttermilk biscuit or along side an aggressively seasoned cheddar cheese waffle with bourbon infused maple syrup and spice infused watermelon.  Any way you have it, it's great.

Friendly service that still needs some polish.  This has been improving with each successive visit.

Well chosen wine list and beer selections at extremely high Vegas resort markups.  Pass.  Opt instead for one of the great southern classics or better yet, a few fingers of bourbon.  To the Pappy's fans, this place has them all.

Which came first?  The chicken or the egg?  At Yardbird, it doesn't matter.  Neither is safe.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,24,24,4,wKDl-XMKsluoaoOJMq24gA

5118355,2015-04-11,33,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"One of the best experiences I've had thus far throughout all my dining endeavors in Vegas. This restaurant was above average in terms of food and service. They take real southern comfort food and present it in an upscale fashion with flavors that truly blew my mind. I had a reservation on a weeknight and was seated within ten minutes of my arrival. Located inside the Venetian hotel, this little gem has romantic and hip vibe as far as the ambiance and the mood.  The items ordered included: 

Deviled eggs: 5/5 they were out of this world. The fresh dill really enhanced the flavors of the egg and they were topped with fresh trout roe (AKA redneck caviar). The caviar added a nice sweetness to the egg. The combination of these ingredients took this dish to another level. 

Smoked and roasted bone marrow: 5/5 WOW. I've had a lot of bone marrow in a lot of different places but what the chef creates here is beyond fantastic. One of the best bone marrow dishes I've had the pleasure to enjoy. The dish comes with country bread and onion jam. The onion jam was surprisingly sweet and not super overwhelmIng. 

Skillet cornbread: 4/5 the seasonings and flavors of this cornbread were on point. I really enjoyed the spiciness of the jalapeño and the smokiness of the cheddar and bacon baked into the nice sweet cornbread. The pieces of corn left whole inside the bread also added a great texture. 

Lewellyn's fine fried chicken: 5/5 this is not your average fried chicken. They brine the bird to lock in that amazing flavor and juiciness and create an amazing texture before frying. I was told that it takes them over 24 hours to make this fried chicken and it is well worth the calories! It is crispy on the outside, not overwhelmed with breading, and just the perfect amount of crunch. After taking the first bite and digging in my mouth was watering from these explosive flavors. The dish is served with spicy Tabasco honey. So simple yet so perfect.

Deep fried Oreos: 5/5 perfect texture and creaminess. This simple dish was so delish and perfectly satisfying to my sweet tooth. The Oreos are fried in rice crispy cereal and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate sauce. Honestly one of the best deserts I have recently had 

House cobbler: 4/5 amazing presentation and very fresh flavors. The apple cobbler was served with a big scoop of ice cream melting on the warm crumble. The tartness of the apple went very well with the sweetness of the crumble. 

My overall meal was fantastic. I cannot explain how difficult it is to find quality food in this city and I believe that this place embodies that and more. Our waiter Justin was the one who suggested most of our choices and was super charming and timely. He made the experience at the restaurant so much better. Whilst eating the cornbread we bit into a sharp piece and were unsure whether or not it was a corn chip. Justin immediately sent us the general manager who took the pieces back to the kitchen and had them examined along with the bread. The GM, Greg, introduced himself and was extremely hospitable and considerate. He ensured us that the pieces were, in fact, corn chips and sent us desert on the house. Having worked in food safety for many years, I truly appreciated his approach and how he handled the situation. Southern hospitality at its finest. When a restaurant has great food and bad service, it will never reach its highest potential. This restaurant had both great food and great service. Kudos to the chef, the management, and the waiters for a 5/5 experience. I will be back to try the other items on the menu!",R7C_PGUiBgJbIgXNkk1I1Q,49,43,5,XxlWtz9r8yWTSf-ZKWAHqQ

The meat is juicy! Bone marrow was good too. Had a lot of fat in it. Their Cesar salad is made warm. They give you literally lettuce that is cut in half without chopping it off... lol.

The food. Where do I start?! We started with the deviled eggs (minus the smoked trout roe) and pork belly bacon. I am unsure how I've lived life without pork belly bacon but I won't make this mistake again. Our drinks were simply spectacular, bacon with the spicy Bloody Mary and another amazing drink with chilies. The deviled eggs were perfectly cooked and the texture was creamy and smooth, with all the flavors melded together. We also had the fried chicken which was to die for.

We were walking around looking for a place to eat and we happened to stumble here because some nice ladies working the door said they were still serving brunch. I'm a brunch kind of gal and my husband knows this. We glanced at the menu and it looked pretty promising. 

The place is a lot bigger than it looks. They have a whole dining area in the back, some bar tables up front, and a lounging area with club chairs and sofas. We were seated right away as we opted to sit in the lounge area. We had two big club chairs to ourselves with two side tables. Probably not super elegant for us to eat in this manner but who cares, we didn't have to wait.

They recommended the fried chicken and watermelon which sounded sweet and savory but I did say I am a brunch kind of gal and some sort of eggs and potatoes already had my name on it. My husband and I shared the mac and cheese and the eggs benedict. The mac and cheese was great. Super creamy and cheesy and all things it should be when having a southern restaurants name on it.

A new-age southern style restaurant in the heart of Venetian.   Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.

Let's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.

Mama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D

Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! 

Fried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. 

Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!

Deviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish

Chicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. 

Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus 

Macaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.

Country Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. 

And for dessert :

Key Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding / mango jelly, light and delicate.

Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients.

Bacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! 



Stick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well!

Cauliflower mashed potatoes: First time having them and I don't think I'll ever go back to regular potatoes.
Green beans & corn: Ate every bite......

Husband had:
Brisket sliders: He loved these
Fries & Mac & cheese: Perfectly seasoned

Lastly, as if we had room for desert, we ordered the butterscotch cake with bacon frosting. I was a little leary at first but trusted our server's (Jerry) advice. Hands down BEST DESSERT IN LAS VEGAS...Will not disappoint. Don't let the bacon fool you.

Known for its fried and herb roasted chicken, this place will have portion sizes enough to feed 2 or more in just one entree.  The deviled eggs were a great start to my poultry meal with a touch of salmon roe, this appetizer helped awaken my tastebuds for the flavors of the south.  For my main plate, I had the ""Chicken 'n watermelon 'n waffles"" which was like a picnic all in one.  The herb flavored fried chicken came in 4 pieces (breast, thigh, drumstick, wing), 4 pieces of waffle, and about 6 pieces or so of watermelon cubes.  The fried chicken was very flavorful, well seasoned, and moist.  The herbs were what really stood out when it came to this chicken's distinct flavor, well worth licking my fingertips;)  It was very filling, in fact, the Yardbird encouraged the food to be shared by placing tongs on the plate.  I was determined to finish most of the half chicken, but the food won and I was defeated with a leftover drumstick and thigh, ""a leg up"" on the competition if this were a case of woman versus food.

On a Sunday afternoon, we were escorted in right away.  The dining rooms are warmly lit and make you feel like you're in a country home.  There is couch seating and tables, luckily we were seated at a table otherwise I might not ever have gotten up.

Coming here I had my mind set on their signature Chicken N' Watermelon N' Waffles ($36).  It did not disappoint!  The chicken was moist and had flavorful crispy skin.  I wasn't crazy about the bourbon syrup on its own, but drizzled on the fluffy waffle with a piece of chicken and a splash of honey hot sauce, everything was delicious together.  The pickled watermelon was something different and complimented the dish nicely.

Everyone that I came with enjoyed their food.  One person got their special of the day that consisted of two eggs on top of biscuits and smothered in chicken gravy.  I had a taste and the gravy was so good that I could've taken a shot of it.

Open, high and low top tables, nice decor, pictures of famous old musicians on the wall. I will say that there was a slide show of musicians where we were seated, but the slide show didn't have a ton of pictures, it repeated a lot. I know that is petty, but if we were there for an hour, every 5 minutes the slideshow repeated, it got boring. 

As I am sitting back in Pittsburgh writing this I am still fondly looking back at the amazing meal that we had. My mouth waters at the salad and entrees, and I wish there was one closer so I could go and maybe try out a dessert or a drink. The food was really good for our only one splurge of the trip. I would say, it was delish and would urge people to try it out. It was expensive The two $$ is a little bit of a stretch. We got two meals and a side salad and it was over $100.  I would say it is more like $$$ than $$. But it was worth it!

Salad: 
Iceberg Wedge: baby iceberg lettuce, charred corn, heirloom tomatoes, house-smoked bacon, avocado, house-made buttermilk ranch dressing. How the heck can a salad be so freaking good? This, and I even cringe thinking about it, ICEBURG lettuce, salad was probably my favorite thing that we ordered, side wise. The tomatoes were so sweet you would have thought they were candied and that house-smoked bacon was more like pork belly than bacon and was just magnificent. We fought over this salad. The dressing, honestly was just as fresh tasting as the rest of the salad. We fought over this salad...it was that good.  

Side:
Macaroni & Cheese: torchio pasta, five artisanal cheeses, crispy herb crust. Honestly, this mac and cheese was just eh. I thought that the noodles were over done and the crispy herb crust tasted just like plain breadcrumbs. I wasn't impressed and wouldn't get it again. Chris thought it was ok. But still meh....and for the price and the size of the plate, its a hard pass for me. 

Meals:
Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken: 1/2 of our famous bird served with honey hot sauce. This was just a plate of fried chicken. BOY was it a huge plate though. The hot sauce was really good too. I enjoyed dipping the chicken into this a lot. My friend, his dish, thought that the chicken should have been done a little more. He enjoys a more crispier crunch to his chicken. I can see where he is coming from. It was still really good and TOO MUCH. We had leftovers for days. 

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles: honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup. OK, the same thing that I wrote about the chicken above goes for this one. I really loved it. I thought that it was done perfectly, but wouldn't have minded more crunch to the chicken myself. I thought that the hot sauce stole the show. The bourbon maple syrup, to me, tasted like straight bourbon. It smelled like bourbon and when you dipped anything it in, it was like a shot. I would pass on this dish just because of that reason. The waffle was good. It was not as crispy as I like my waffles usually nor did it have a really strong cheddar cheese taste to it. I was expecting more from this dish. While good, it was all together, meh. The watermelon too was just meh. It was spiced I think with just mint. Nothing fancy, and for the price of the dish I would have liked more than 6 squares of watermelon. 

Overall, I had a good time here and would have liked to try more things than just the chicken. we realized our mistake when we got the dish and kicked ourselves for not ordering different things so we could try more. I would say, try it if you want, but if the menu seems to meh, there are a ton of other places to go in Vegas.",-hietrA8M58asfpyJkCyiA,3,4,4,AOw9Cicghl7McNsXvwhLlw

For that reason is why I can only give it a max 4 star. Don't get me wrong the food was awesome! I just don't feel like the price is worth it to come back and eat here all the time. Especially for fried chicken. 

We ordered a wedge salad and fried green tomato appetizer and I love love love the pork belly!!! It was so good in both dishes I would just come back for that!! I've actually never had fried green tomato before and I will say it was a memorable dish. The salad was also fire! 

So the chicken wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had for I feel the batter is lacking. The preparation was actually phenomenal!! You can always tell when they cook the breast perfectly it's not too dry! Was still very juicy and I enjoyed it. I will say the waffle was really good too. The syrup they served with it was MEH. But that's just me I prefer just regular maple syrup would have been better than the bourbon they used. But combine all of it with the hot sauce in one bite and the combination was a party in my mouth. So I recommend taking a piece of chicken and waffle add syrup and hot sauce all in 1 bite! Yummy!! 

If yardbird found a way to bring their prices down or even offer some type of local specials I would see myself being a regular but until then it's hard to say when I would want to eat here again but I definitely enjoyed it!",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,6,3,4,k-mml_A6nNh4IVwrd287HQ

They have several local brewers on tap which impressed me as a beer drinker. The first beer I had was Never Pass Up A Blonde by Sin City Brewing. A light beer palatable with a ABV of 3.8. Was not filling which I like so I can still enjoy my meal. (which did not happen) We got seated and I ordered a Gunshot by Bad Boy Brewing. That was an Irish stout that was lighter than I expected, and good with the meal. 
Let us talk about the meal. Ugh!!! As an app I got the fried pickle spears. Spicy and salty with a spicy mayo dip. Probably the highlight of the food portion of our meal. BBq Pork belly was okay nothing stand out about it. I ordered the Fried catfish....probably a mistake at a fried chicken joint. The breading was bland and the fish did not have any flavor I had to actually ask for pepper in a restaurant which should be an insult to ask for flavoring. It came with gritts which were more like rice balls with sugar added. So sweat it was as if someone put sugar in the salt shaker in the kitchen. I ordered corn bread but never got it because they ran out. It was only a 7 pm dinner. Josie got the chicken. She thought it was okay but it was also very sweet. Again maybe sugar for salt. The table mostly ordered chicken and gritts. Mac and cheese was ordered but that was not impressive when again mine at home is pretty superb. The staff seemed like they wanted us to hurry and finish the meal. Our waitress kept rushing us to order and finish. We did complain to management about the sweet tasting food and the fact I never got corn bread. They offered us a free desert but we were afraid that might be too salty. I cannot recommend the food here or the service. The Bar is outstanding and beer selection choice. 
If you go I hope your experience is better. By the reviews it seemed like a slam dunk. I have not had best experience lately with the on the strip in the hotel restaurants.

On this trip I told my boyfriend this was a must do on the list for our mini vacay so one night we rounded up the group and had dinner. I knew going in this location would not have my favorite Miami beer but was still sad to not see it on the list. I was very happy however to see the mac and cheese and Mama's biscuits. That stuff really is what heaven tastes like. There is not one item on the menu that I have had and not enjoyed.

We got the chicken and waffles to share (very smart to share because we still had leftovers) .  Chicken was good, waffle was good but being a huge fan of the waffles at Roscoes if your waffle doesn't taste like there's it will never be amazing to me, but nonetheless a damn good waffle. There was some spicy watermelon bites that came with the plate which were also very good.  That syrup however just took everything to the next level. I think it could probably make just about anything taste the bomb! It was sweet, rich, buttery bourbon goodness. Just melts in your mouth.  

We also had the mac cheese which wasn't bad but it didnt have any crispy slighlty burnt cheese pieces which I weirdly enjoy.  My husband also said he had the best bloody Mary hes ever had here.  

I couldn't give it 5 stars due to price. The chicken and waffle plate was about 39 dollars alone. Ouch! Drinks were expensive too. I know its Vegas but I like my southern food with southern prices.

5208294,2017-02-21,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Was only spending 2 nights/dinners in Vegas on this trip and one of the two dinners was here. Our very first Yardbird dining experience was the location in South Beach and was such a memorable meal we figured we had to hit the one in Vegas while in town. Having to travel a lot for work and being a foodie, I'm always amazed and appreciate when restaurants are able to extend their footprint and keep the quality and service levels high.  If I had not eaten at the other location previously, my review would be higher as I wouldn't have a baseline on the chicken (which is what really killed the rating for me). 

I'll start with some positives though - the bourbon and whiskey selection and pricing is amazing.  Why pay $13 for a single pour of woodford when for only $15 you can get cask strength Stagg JR?  Wine list and beer lists are fantastic as well. 

Our Order:
On this trip we ordered the Charcuterie as an appetizer and shared a chicken and waffles along with a side of Mac n cheese.  

The charcuterie ($26) came out and our eyeballs about popped out of our head. Great visual appeal and looked awesome from a portion perspective, but in hindsight was too dominated by prosciutto.  You're probably thinking this guy writing the review is a schmuck and is complaining about getting too much expensive meat, but in reality it was gagging. Have you ever had too large a deli sandwich and you get done and feel meated out? Of all the charcuteries I've had there is usually a nice balance of multiple types of meat, cheese, accompaniments for sharing.  I guess shame on me for not investigating contents first and assuming there would be a nice variety, but here is what was on it - 2 small 1"" cubes of cheese, 4 half slices of bread (limp greasy pieces not toasted nearly enough), pickles, pickled onions, pickled okra, their 3 spreads, and 3 huge rose shaped pinwheels of prosciutto (totally not shareable either as everyone would have to paw up the meat to separate it). It wasn't all bad news, ion the positive side, their pickled okra is awesome but you only 2 small pieces.  The onion marmalade, cheese and pimento spread, and seeded mustard side are all awesome accompaniments that you do need to find a way to try.  Heck cut the meat quantity in half and give a small variety and this would be top notch. 

Mac n cheese - no issues - was excellent, noodles cooked perfectly, awesome crispy char on top and perfect blend of cheeses. Far Better than most BBQ joints who claim to have great Mac!  

Fried Chicken - definitely a minus 2 star here and was let down.  Crispy fried chicken.  Crispy fried chicken. Just saying it conjures up a great visual and pending taste experience.  I love visiting places such as Gus's (chain out of Memphis) and Babe's in TX because it's awesome crispy fried chicken. Our server did a great job painting the picture and explaining the super crispy fried chicken but it came out as soggy as 1 hour old bucket of KFC I picked up at the drive thru on the way home from work. Now don't get me wrong, flavor and quality of meat were second to none. We were hungry from walking around all afternoon and really were looking forward to chicken and waffles.  It was a late dinner for us and the sound of air being let out of the balloon was all I could think about as I ate it.  Look you could chalk it up to a bad batch or a chicken cook rushing out the food, but the chicken should have never been served like that. I'm going with the ""rushing meals out"" part because the waffles were shorted a good 30 seconds in the iron too as they were missing that fine balance of cook time between soggy to crispy.  That crispy is what holds the syrup back a bit from being absorbed like spongebob.  Ours were definitely undercooked. 

Our first meal in South Beach location was that memorable it jaded me for this review.  Unfortunately we were let down.  I didn't complain to Mgmt because I didn't want my meal comped or have it re-cooked, wanted my check and go back to my hotel.  We paid full price, enjoyed a good (not great) meal and really have no regrets.

They serve it with both syrup and a hoisin-y hot sauce; the latter kept the meal interesting for me. Between the one entree and the biscuits (very good), we were stuffed to the gills.

Our server was attentive and proactive without being pushy; he sensed that we were casual lunchgoers and that had us in and out inside of 35 minutes, but we never felt like he was trying to turn the table.

The atmosphere was fine - very country chic. It was a little loud, but that's to be expected in what is essentially an underground casino mall. I think we paid about $50: one drink each, one app, one entree. Expensive for chicken, but also to be expected in LV.

Minor note: while it's by no means a rare beer, I love Abita Purple Haze, so any chicken place that has the good sense to keep that by the bottle definitely gets good marks for judgment.",xQyQmldNrLxTj56sA8Wyhg,0,0,4,N3sAgIFXLrEAIt2i7LSP-A

But I also happen to have an affinity for fried chicken. This was also my birthday so the pressure to find a good dinner spot was on. 

I made a reservation thru yelp. And the rest was a smoothly orchestrated experience. The hostess sat us immediately (on a Sunday night). I was directed by staff to easily located the restroom so I could wash up. And everyone greeted me with a smile. Brandon was my server and he was totally personable. He talked to my table as if we were his long time friends and make great recommendations. 

Update *** As I'm writing this review, the manager on duty visits my table to ask how my experience was and I was raving!! He was so great too. He ordered me a round of drinks for my birthday on the house. Thank You!

So in a nutshell, this is what's amazing about this place. Tasty food + stylish interior + professional staff = a top notch dining experience. I perceive that everyone enjoys working there. They're so great at what they do and they do it with ease. The wait staff communicates very well. All the little things add up and make for an unforgettable experience. 

Now the food: 
I ordered roasted bone marrow and deviled eggs for appetizers. Soooooooo delicious. 
For dinner, I ordered fried chicken, waffles and watermelon. That receives a 10/10 from me. And again, I eat a lot of fried chicken. This measures up and probably sets the bar! For drinks, I had a peach iced tea and the bourbon lemonade. 

Another compliment I can give is that when you're in here, you almost forget you're in a casino/hotel IN A GOOD WAY. There is so much charm in this restaurant. I would say it's fine dining without being snobby or overly posh. The interior is stylish. Feels like it was designed by HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines lol. 

Thank You again everyone. I will be back with friends on my next visit. I will only write yelp reviews when the service is exceptional or poor. In this case, it was overly exceptional.",n5E7aqBgWqdjVJc_Hu90iA,0,0,5,oQFMQO6uyp0g3c8NpY_X_g

The first time our server was Jojo, first of all he was so excited to have us dining in for the first time. He gave us a quick and very honest review of the menu including signature items and dishes that give you the best bang for your buck. From there we decided on the Blue Plate Special which comes with two pieces of their special fried chicken, a biscuit and watermelon cubes. It took only minutes for our food to arrive, hot, fresh and ready to devour. We quickly gobbled up our food and the only thing we regretted after was not ordering more! We did not have drinks or desert despite
The fact that the State Fair Fry and the Fresh Naked to Order Peach Cobbler were calling my name. The send time we went back we got the Blue Plate Special again but order additional sides. For people who are particular about their Mac n cheese I can tell you you'll like this one. Comes in a mini cast iron Dutch over so it's kept warm for the duration of your meal and is rich and cheesy. Everything about this meal made it worth the price.

5249850,2015-03-25,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Came here with a group of 8, so we got to try a number of things.  I'll start by saying that the fried chicken was solid 7/10.  However, for a $55 whole fried chicken to be worth it, it better be the best.  Also, don't be fooled by the ""serves 2-4"" note, that is for just a half chicken.

Otherwise, the food is mostly ok, expensive, and not cooked particularly well.  The frog legs we ordered came out rubbery and food generally came out cold and a little soggy. They mentioned that dishes come out whenever they are ready, but  seemed like they must have sat for a while before reaching our table.  They make no effort for sides to at least come out with main plates. 

I found it funny that every time the servers put anything down it wasn't just ""here is your chicken.""  They also had to mumble byline (i.e. brined for 24hrs), so you know it's ""special.""

I know they are going for upscale southern soul food, but if Yardbird is going to charge those kind of prices, I would expect their kitchen to get it together.  They could probably reduce their extensive menu until they can get the basics correct.  Frankly, it is nothing special and you should wait go to a Bojangles instead if you need a fried chicken fix.

There are too many good places to go on the strip, even just within the Venetian.  Skip this one.

I have wanted to try Yardbird for some time now, since I have heard a number of good things about this place and the reviews looked amazing.  So, on Sunday we ended up celebrating my friends birthday party here.  Upon being seated, I was never asked what type of table was required of my party, I was simply escorted to a high top table in the back.  Which would not have worked for a pregnant woman and a person with a baby.  Nonetheless, they did change our table to a flat top table in the corner, with not a lot of room.  

In regards to the food, the food was okay.  My friends ordered two appetizers, which were the bourbon glazed donuts, and biscuits.  According to my friends, the donuts and biscuits were delicious.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, my friends ordered an open face omelet,  deviled eggs, fried green tomato, and the shrimp n' grits.  I enjoyed my chicken and waffle minus the watermelon salad ( I only removed the watermelon because I do not like it) however, the presentation was nice.  My one friend had to return her shrimp n' grits as it has a sour taste to it and she was not pleased with the dish.  My other friends loved their food and the presentation of their food.

Their service was okay.  We had to continually ask for refills of water and coffee.  Our server rarely checked in on our party, so we had to flag down another waiter for assistance.

The 5 star customer service was evident from the moment we sat down. One of the managers came over and gave us a few of his menu favorites: the fried chicken, the southern Caesar salad and the peach cobbler which is made to order.  His description of the Caesar salad had my mouth watering so I tried that as an appetizer. We also added the deviled eggs to our pre-dinner meal. The salad was so good I may have dreams about it but it was the entrees that had our eyes rolling to the heavens they were so good!

I shared the fried chicken which is marinated for 20 plus hours with my cousin and we both agreed we never REALLY had fried chicken until that moment. I usually douse my chicken with hot sauce no matter how good it is and let's just say the hot sauce virtually remained untouched. I don't know what there secret is but suffice it to say the chicken was amazing. I paired my fried bird with pan fried okra topped with cheese which was magical.  

My other cousin had the fall-off-the-bone short rib and we shared both biscuits and corn bread. The only thing that was just okay was the macaroni and cheese but everything else was so good it really didn't matter.

The menu is interesting since none of the main entrees come automatically with sides - everything is a la carte, I think that part threw us off since a few of us wanted to split dinner, normal assumption is entree comes with 1-2 sides.

Was it taken off the bill?  No it was not.  We asked for a taste of mac n cheese to see if we wanted to also get that as a group to split.  Waiter said they didn't do that.  What?  Really!

I would not come back to this restaurant, especially with the incredible amount of food restaurant options all over the Strip, and all through-out The Venetian.",WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg,28,26,3,Cs1yCjedjQkh5tPRTcjf1A

I went with my husband and we ordered the following:

Fried green tomato BLT: crunchy and flavorful pork belly. The tomato was thick and crunchy too. 

Chicken and waffles: one of most juicy fried chicken I've had. Waffles were really crispy. Goes really well with the fried chicken. Was told by our server that chicken was bribed for 26 hours. 

Chicken and Biscuit: biscuit with gravy and chicken. 

Peach cobbler: sweet peaches with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

It was so crispy on the outside but the soft on the inside. You can tell there is some marinating going on here. I haven't had fried chicken this good since my Grandmothers buttermilk fried chicken. The hot sauce has a sweet undertone to it and is a great compliment to The chicken. The server said they add a lil honey to their hot sauce.  We also had the collared greens, jalapeno sweet cornbread, Brussels sprouts, mac n cheese, short ribs with cauliflower mash and pickled veggies.  EVERYTHING was so tasty. We cleaned those plates, no doggy bags for us.
Customer service was excellent. We originally tried to make reservations and weren't allowed to because they were booked up.  However the host informed us that we could try to walk in, and the wait may not be that long. Well lucky for us we only waited maybe 20 minutes, and we were seated right by the kitchen. At 1st we kinda of scoffed at being seated there but we loved it. That's where all the energy was. The kitchen was so clean and operated so smoothly. Seeing all those yummy looking dishes come out made your mouth water. The lighting was better than the rest of the restaurant and our table accommodated our party of 6 comfortably. 
The only downside....... after our feast my feet were swelling up by the end of the night. That usually happens when I eat rich, savory, fatty, salty food. So it's pretty authentic southern soul food. Lol. I couldn't eat here to often for that reason but it's definitely a treat to look forward to.",43c4ItmwvBZig53-qN_-EA,0,0,5,A03u6jn2nVQDMMYg38WiPw

We got lucky only waiting for 15 minutes. If you have a bigger party  expect to wait 45 minutes or more. Try coming during the beginning or middle of the week. 

The inside: dim, more intimate, and family style sit down restaurant. A lot of seating from the bar to table tops, and booth style seating. Atmosphere of workers were also welcoming and helpful, especially to first timers.

On the menu: they are known for their chicken, hence the name. They have odds n ends, small plates, sides, desserts, salads, biscuits, and chicken specials. Looking at the menu, my fiance and I ordered: the famous chicken n waffle n watermelon combo, lewelyns fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, and the mac n cheese w/brisket. To soak it down w/their special sweet tea.

The taste and the wait: lets just say this place by far passes all the places I have eaten at. The chicken was perfectly cooked, evenly seasoned, and extremely juicy. Add their special in house hot sauce and BAM heaven in your mouth. Waffles were fluffy, add the special bourbon syrup to it...again LOVED it. Watermelon, added sweetness to the end of the entire meal. The cornbread, on point. Not dry, spicy since they have jalapenos in it and moist (even after having leftovers, it was off the chain). Collard greens, spicy, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Last the mac n cheese w/brisket, who can say no to that?? As matter of fact hats off to the chef (s) back in the kitchen. They made all the food with love. 

Only reason why one star was taken was due to cold food. Everything else has come down to almost perfect service. Thank you yardbird, this will forever be our go to spot to live the life of the dirty south.",pa8zvcFxnj6jFtywlxKf_g,0,0,4,D_t7EWbOnSn1L764fOol8g

The mac and cheese is very good. Okra, not fried but grilled, was not our favorite (I think okra is best served fried but oh well). Sweet tea was ok but did not taste like authentic southern sweet tea to me.

Fried Green Tomatoes:
The acidity of the green tomatoes cuts through the salty and fatty goodness from the pork belly. Interesting flavor and texture contrast in a bite or two. 4/5

Deviled Eggs:
It is because of these deviled eggs that I found out what I've been missing out on. Delicate egg white with fluffy egg yolk with mustard and spices, topped with salty roe. I'm addicted! 5/5

Chicken Biscuits:
Crumbly warm biscuits lightly drizzled with honey on top. The pepper jelly is a nice touch. A pretty thick cut of breaded fried chicken in between. Delightful! This is what I always get if I have plans of stuffing my face with their other delicious food. 5/5

Mac and Cheese:
Overflowing with tasty cheesy macaroni with a mild heat. It is topped with bread crumbs for texture. 4/5

Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles:
Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. The inside is tender and juicy. The outside is crunchy and has glorious flavors. The waffles are savory and come with a bourbon maple syrup. All that comes with a side of seasoned watermelon cubes. They just totally 1-upped everyone else's chicken and waffles. 5/5

Maple Bacon Doughnuts:
These are only served for brunch. They're small, light, fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth, sweet and savory rings of fried dough. It comes with a side of maple glaze to dunk your doughnuts in. The best maple bacon doughnuts in this town! 5/5

I've tried their super marvelous dessert: Hummingbird Cake with butter pecan ice cream. Oh my goodness! It was magnificent. The menu description did it no justice. Now, they took it off the menu. RIP, HC.

I usually do one side and everything is enough for 2 people. This time I decided to get the biscuits 4 for $7. My only complaint is it could have been fluffier, it seemed burnt in my opinion however it was good enough to cut in half and make mini sandwiches with the chicken. The chicken and waffles came with a watermelon salad that was very refreshing. The okra was delicious! Totally worth the $10. They also had a cauliflower that was off menu that we didn't get to try.

The Porkchop $15 ""Duke bourbon, Yardbird dijon syrup!!!, yuzu juice & apple cider, 1 1/4"" block ice with a dijon thyme cube"":  When I indicated I wanted this, the bartender asked me twice, ""Are you SURE!?"", further telling me that many people don't like it due to the fact that there is a very heavy mustard taste.  I was like HELLS YES!!!--mustard!?  Never drank anything with mustard in it!  Well................ I was really disappointed from my first sip since I was expecting to be tasting some wild phenol peat-bomb like Octomore Scotch, reminiscent of Lawry's prime rib with waaaay too much mustard seed and horseradish on it.    ....................blah..... just a sweet cocktail.   Waaaaaaaaaa!?  Huge letdown.  Couldn't taste much of that mustard at all.  They could have quintupled it without bothering me.  Well, anyway, great idea.... needs work.  6/10

He decided that he wanted to go here because he liked the menu and was impressed with the Whiskey/Bourbon list. It was pretty darn impressive but I stuck with my norm, Basil Haydens.

Upon arrival we were promptly greeted by the hostesses. Who sat us in the back part of the restaurant; it was nice because it was quieter than out front in the bar/restaurant area. The restaurant itself was very unique; it was like a modern twist on an old farmhouse. There was ample seating and all very different but it all worked well together. I liked the little room off to the side that felt like another world and the slide show was interesting. Despite being a fairly large restaurant the way they had it set up felt very intimate. 

Service was excellent! Upon sitting down the busser quickly filled our water glasses, brought us bread and asked if we needed anything to drink. The server arrived shortly after and told us the specials. He seemed to really know the menu and was very excited about the quality of their food. I liked that the menu is served on a clipboard, it was a cool twist. Our drinks came very quickly and our food came out SUPER QUICK! It's like they knew we were coming and what we were going to order. 

The food was so good! The quality and attention to detail did not go unnoticed. I ordered the half chicken, French fries and fried okra. The chicken was so moist and flavorful! The fried okra was delicious! Fries were fries. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles. He devoured it so quickly I'm not sure he even tasted it, haha.

I made a reservation on OpenTable for Mother's Day brunch.  Yardbird is located on Restaurant Row inside the Venetian Hotel & Casino.  If you parked at the hotel, it's an easy walk.  We came on foot off the Strip, and it took us awhile to find Restaurant Row inside the casino.

We were seated promptly in a nice corner area.  Bar high table facing out into the casino.  

We knew we wanted to order the fried chicken & waffles with spiced watermelon. $36.  Comes with one waffle, four pieces of chicken and 6 cubes of spiced watermelon.  Enough for two to share.  The chicken is brined for 27 hours.  We got a huge chicken breast; one thigh; one wing/drummette; and one drumstick.  We glanced around and saw many folks ordering this dish.

Our server suggested we start with the deep fried green tomatoes & pork belly appetizer.  Great suggestion.  The tomatoes were lightly coated and was crispy.  Pork belly could have been crispier but still good paired up with the tomatoes.

For dessert we ordered the maple glazed bacon bits donuts as I noticed it wasn't on the regular dessert menu, only on the brunch menu.  I love donuts so had to go with the donuts.  Came with maple or caramel sauce with more bacon bits.  Served in a skillet.  Sooo good.

On Saturday, 6/10/17, I had one of my best (dare I say THE best) dining experiences (my basis for comparison is casual and fine dining on the regular as well as VIP events hosted by casinos).  If you have not dined at Yardbird on Restaurant Row inside Venetian--GO NOW--RUN--the food is fantastic (Com'on it's Southern Cooking = Deep Fried *almost* Everrrryyythang), and the service is phenomenal!!!

It was about 3pm, generally speaking, the lag time between lunch and dinner crowds, but it was Brunch-o-clock on a Saturday (I really hate waiting for more than 10-15 minutes for seating.  There are so many options in Vegas, that if you try, prompt seating is available somewhere.).  When in Vegas, you gotta gamble and just roll the dice.  My husband and I walked up to the hostess stand with no reservations and was offered immediate seating.  To two hungry people, this is almost better than winning at slots.

Smartly dressed in a black suit, the hostess was friendly and engaging while showing us to our table.  

She asked, ""How's your Saturday morning going?""

In a city brimming with tourists, participating in typical tourist activities, typical responses will vary from: 1) I'm SO hungover from last nite, 2) I lost $ XXXX, 3) I WON $XX.

I probably could have just been normal and responded with the standard polite response that we all have on file, ""Fine, thank you, and you?""  I'm not sure if it was low blood sugar, or I just really needed another human being to know that I battled a plumbing problem for 2 hours and was victorious--I stammered a bit and chuckled, ""Do you really want to know?""

Without missing a beat, the hostess replied, ""Sure, I'd love to know the real story.""

So I proceeded to tell her how my husband and I started this Saturday in a terrible way, entrenched in plumbing hell for 2 hours, but luckily, the problem was now resolved.  And we were tired and hungry, and ready to eat some delicious fried thangs...

Meanwhile, my ultra private and conservative husband was  giving me the side eye, which translated into, ""Why are you telling this poor lady our plumbing problems?  She doesn't want or need to know.""

You can't really end a conversation on plumbing problems--it leaves a bad aftertaste.  So we chatted about other random things, such as the fact that we were both servants to attention-needy little dogs who demand belly rubs by showing us their bellies.  Ah, that's much better.

Minutes after we ordered, the hostess showed up at our table with a beautifully plated Fried Green Tomato BLT and said, ""I hope this BLT will ease your troubled morning with plumbing problems.""

WHUT?!?!?

The primary job of a hostess is to seat customers (and to make small talk on the way to the table, sometimes possibly learning bizarre information such as plumbing problems, lol)--bringing a complimentary appetizer is probably not a part of her job description.

I was confused.  

Well, as it turned out, our hostess was actually the manager, Sarah Crain.  

MIND. BLOWN.

Having worked in the restaurant industry for over 10+ years myself, and dining out for 20+ years, I know and have observed that restaurant managers do not work the hostess station, especially not during lag time.

The manager Sarah actually seated us herself, rather than made us wait for the hostess who was already seating another party.  On the way to our table, affable Sarah engaged us in small talk and made us feel like welcomed guests.  She even gave us a complimentary appetizer to soothe our plumbing woes.  My husband and I thanked Sarah profusely for her thoughtfulness--this small act of kindness lifted both of our spirits.

In a city that preaches hospitality, today, I experienced the GOLD standard.  Thank you Sarah for your warmth and hospitality--you made dining at Yardbird so magical, like a visit to Grandma's homecooking with love.

Please see the attached pics for the amazing food--they tasted even better than they looked.  And as already described in detail above, the service and hospitality at Yardbird is Phenomenal!!!!",abVrCVcWKbyxCn-QyzlUbg,0,1,5,GWl-WEhQIm9bV1s2bnYemg

5344085,2015-04-07,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Visited for Easter Sunday lunch with the family. The place is pretty much packed.

What we ordered:
Beverages: 2 sprites for the kids, Southern Revival, Watermelon slings. 
Appetizer: Chicken liver toast
Entrees: Shrimp and Grits, Chicken n watermelon n waffle + The crunchy yardbird sandwich

What we thought:
2 6oz glass bottle of Sprite at $ 4 each...  too expensive. Just order water for them next time..lol  The Southern Revival is very good, watermelon slings is little bit too bitter
Chicken liver toast is good. Crunchy and warm bread topped with creamy liver, the only drawback is the liver is little bit cold. 

Shrimp and Grits, perfectly cooked gulf shrimp and the grits are very creamy and cheesy. The fried Chicken are very very good, perfectly brined and moist, could be little bit more crunchy though. The cheddar waffle are so crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside, very tasty. 

Since the menu says both the Shrimp and grits and Fried Chicken are shareable entrees for 2-4 ppl, so we thought the 2 entrees should feed my family of 5 including 3 children.... NOT   The portions are for like 1 adult... 

Thus, I ordered the Chicken sandwich at the end, good sandwich though...

Good food, nice decor, great waiting staff. Portions are little small for the price.",CwI3u4sgLWkcmwetuEwiMQ,0,0,4,vemEjxwEAm-eqy2Ll4aqGQ
5346604,2018-03-12,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Had dinner last night at this restaurant with some friends it was my choice. Looking for casual but good. First thing to Note Restaurant can be very loud we had to ask for a table change because we could hardly hear each other talk! They were able to accommodate us on that situation. Then when I was sitting there I reach to move my chair and a piece of glass went into my finger... Removed it and my thumb started bleeding.. they were on it and came over with Band-Aids and they even sent a manager over see how I was doing. When I asked if they would comp the drink..  they said.. sure, no problem. When the check came they had not come through on their promise! Don't promise if you don't come through. Now about the food.. cornbread was a bit dry, Fried Chicken was delicious.. the drinks were horrendous we should have sent them back..my gin and tonic had a very bad taste like the tonic was not good. But I was sick of complaining.. Service was really bad they left the plates on the table from appetizers for 10 or 15 minutes. We received our appetizers before we received our cocktails. Fried Chicken was delicious but the rest was not good do not highly recommend.. especially annoyed about the manager acting like he cared and came over to sit with us for 5 minutes and then didn't come through with what he promised! Oh well it's Vegas!!!

So a little update on this above review. The owner of the restaurant did reach out to me when he saw my displeasure with my experience. He did invite me to come back and experience the restaurant again. But I informed him that I lived in Los Angeles. And not Las Vegas. He then informed me that they were opening a new restaurant in Los Angeles and I would be welcome to go there with my friend when they opened. I accepted his invitation and we chose a date and he told me that he would make a reservation for me directly with the manager at the restaurant here in Los Angeles... When that date arrived, my friend and I went to the restaurant. The food was definitely better than my experience in Las Vegas. The service was still a bit uneven. But in their defense, the restaurant had just opened a couple weeks prior and they were quite busy.. The prices are a bit high. But the quality is quite good and the portions are also quite large. The strange part was at the end of the meal they gave us the check!!!!! It was a little odd because they had invited us to come back and no one has ever said anything during the whole meal about that, which made me mildly uncomfortable! Luckily I had copies of the email communication with the owner of the restaurant who had reached out to me. I had to have the manager come over and show him those emails. He was a bit brusque with me!!! Which took me a bit by surprise but of course immediately took care of the check. Knowing that we were guests of the owner and all, I just expected them to be a little bit more solicitous about our opinion. Any way better food than Vegas!. And this location seems to be doing quite well. And of course a big thank you to the owner for being kind enough to do that.",TIgntk2XC27y2Q50DXex4A,0,0,3,X4iVqYtsneCVklzRJrq09A

For our main course we split the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles, they know how to make fried chicken, I cried a little as I ate it.

We stayed at the Venetian, so Yardbird was very conveniently located about a minute walk from the elevators. I didn't realize until we tried to return for brunch on Monday (yes it was that good!) that they only offer brunch on the weekend. 

IF YOU ARE IN VEGAS ON A WEEKEND YARDBIRD'S BRUNCH IS A MUST!!! 

We put our names on a list and 20 minutes later we received a text. Our table was ready.  We heard that the portion sizes were huge so we decided to order the biscuits and gravy, to share, and an order of the maple glazed bacon donuts for something sweet. Even sharing, we had more than enough food. We had a hard time finishing and left stuffed. The food is very rich. 

The biscuits and gravy were INSANE!!!  Served as an open faced biscuit, topped with a crispy chicken thigh, 2 perfectly runny poached eggs, and covered in country gravy, this dish was perfection. Paired with the maple glazed bacon donuts, topped with the crispiest bacon and served with a side of gooey warm maple bacon glaze for dipping, this meal would be a contender for my last meal ever. Sooooo good!

If Yardbird were near my home, I'd probably eat there weekly and surely gain 50 pounds!  So, it's probably a good thing it's not, lol:)  But on vacation, it's totally worth the splurge.

The meat was extremely tender and the seasonings on the sides were excellent. 

My boyfriend got the burger. The burger was 18 and came with fries. Pretty pricey for a burger I thought, but 32 for my meal seemed reasonable given the 14 oz cut of meat I got.

First I'll say I love the decor and the set up. The service is awesome and fast. However when we were seated, our server offered water but gave us room temp water; I actually had to ask for ice. The menu was limited for brunch but I figure that means they make a few things great and stick to that. 
We started with the Fried Green Tomato BLT. The presentation was pretty and the flavors all bended well together. I would give that 5 stars! Most of their cocktails seemed to be Whisky or Bourbon based, I hate dark liquor but didn't seem to have much of a choice *shrug* I tried the watermelon sling which was made with white whisky and was actually pretty tasty. For my entree I had the shrimp & grits. The shrimp was good, but didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked, the grits were good too separately, But together, the flavors didn't seem to blend well. I guess now that I live in the south and have had shrimp & grits in various ways, the shrimp & grits here were memorable. I would not get them again. My partner had the chicken with a side of
Mac & cheese. The chicken was good, I liked it. I had better but it wasn't bad. The Mac & Cheese was good but could have come out a little hotter and less dry. I prefer my Mac & Cheese more creamy. For dessert I tried the butterscotch cake with bacon infused frosting. I had been eying that ever since I discovered this place online. However, though it wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The cake itself was kinda dense and the frosting was too. I prefer a moist fluffy but rich type of cake. This one was heavy.

I was little skeptical about this place but figured I'd give it a shot. Service was very friendly but overall it was mediocre and a little overpriced (even by strip standards) and I can't say I see much of a reason for a return trip. 

The smoked peaches and ham drink was interesting and I enjoyed their creative drink that used bourbon, peach syrup and smoked ham. It had a nice flavor without too much sweetness. 

The ham biscuits were good but I should mention they're served with regular thin sliced ham rather than the traditional, saltier country ham. 

The brisket sandwich was a large portion so you won't leave hungry. It's not a traditional BBQ sandwich and is covered with a tasty but a bit sweet BBQ sauce and served with lettuce on the sandwich. The brisket doesn't have much smoked flavor on its own so I have to doubt whether it was freshly smoked. As they say, great meat doesn't  need too much sauce.

One note, a new waiter at the table next to ours accidentally threw away their $25 peach cobbler leftovers. It takes like 30-45 mins to make so they couldn't make another one easily, oops. 

Overall, I'm glad I tried it and did enjoy my meal but I wasn't blown away. If you're looking for a Southern type meal on the strip this place is alright but if you're from the South this place won't quite impress you.",j7Ew20Kh33lFEaUXW1rGNw,2,2,3,sIljme-RvxGNlEttnUKM-w

My bf and I were craving chicken and waffles (out of all things in Vegas) when we stumbled upon this place on Yelp. We made our way to the Venetian and were seated almost immediately. 

We ordered the deviled eggs ($11) to start because it's one of their most famous dishes. Well, it was super delicious and had the right amount of seasoning on it! It had trout roe on top, which was a change but it totally worked well with the eggs and gave it the extra flavor. 

We also ordered the Chicken 'N Watermelon 'N Waffles ($36) and that was definitely one of the best dishes I've ever had. It may seem pricey but the entire plate was bigger than the two of our heads and it was actually really filling for two people. Plus, the whole dish was so heavenly and mouthwatering so the price was so worth it!

First of all, the chicken was fried perfectly and had this delicious seasoned flavor to it. We didn't realize how tasty fried chicken could be and Yardbird turned this comfort dish into a masterpiece! The watermelon had this spicy Cajun taste to it and it was such a unique flavor and it went so well with the fried chicken and waffles! Now the waffles were amazing as well and they had the perfect, cheesy and savory taste and soft texture. I seriously wish I could recreate the waffles and this entire dish at home! 

I'm so glad we didn't order more things because we were STUFFED after that and we wouldn't have been able to finish. But I'm also sad we weren't able to try anything else since we were so full. I've recommended those two dishes to all of my friends and they all enjoy them as well. 

Overall, the service, food, and ambience here is a perfect 5 stars! I can't wait to be back in Vegas just to come back to Yardbird.",94ot0CyYf-DhFy0NTOAFLQ,10,9,5,LYhln_Ddku6nJwzmo2BRkQ

5406637,2017-07-08,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"TLDR - A little pricey but portions are large and easily shareable. Go for the perfectly crisp and moist fried chicken and ask for some bourbon maple syrup to pair with the chicken and hot sauce!

Definitely more of a $$$ restaurant, not the $$ price tag that Yelp claims. Entrees average around $30, so that alone without apps, sides or drinks will put you in the $$$ range. 

That being said, the portions are pretty big for one person so unless you have a very large appetite, it's easy to share an entree and maybe an appetizer or side between 2 people. My group of 6 wasn't super hungry when we came so 3 of us split an entree and a side while the other 3 split an entree and 2 sides. 

The restaurant was busy! We dropped in on a weeknight around 8:30-9PM (though on a long weekend) and were told there would be a 40 min wait, but luckily a party with a reservation cancelled so we ended up getting seated earlier. I'd definitely recommend making a reservation in advance if you can. 

The inside is trendy and chic, with an open kitchen which we got to sit next to. Service is friendly and attentive. And food came out SUPER fast. I was expecting to wait 30 min. Our food was served in maybe 10-15 min, which seemed too fast, yet our food looked and tasted freshly prepared, so they must just have their kitchen really in order. 

I ended up sharing their famous Fine Fried Chicken and a side of Crispy Brussels with 2 other people, and thought this was a pretty good portion size. If we were hungrier, just another side or appetizer would probably have been enough.

* LEWELLYN'S FINE FRIED CHICKEN ($26) - 5/5
[1/2 bird w/ honey hot sauce]
YUM. Came with 4 pieces of chicken - thigh, breast, wing and drumstick - so again, it was a pretty large portion of food. Easy to share between 2 people; a little awkward between 3 but you can cut the large thigh or breast into 2. The outside was deep fried to a perfect crisp without being too greasy or oily, while the inside was moist and juicy. The hot sauce was good but the better option was the bourbon maple syrup from the Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles that my other friends shared as their entree, or mixing the hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. The maple syrup had just enough bourbon in it to make it interesting without being overpowering. So addicting! I'm sure the waiter wouldn't hesitate to bring you some if you asked. 

* CRISPY BRUSSELS ($10) - 5/5
[spiced honey]
I love brussels sprouts but I'm usually hesitant to actually order them at restaurants because they tend to be overly greasy and not particularly crispy. Not these though! I loved all the crispy leaves and the touch of honey. Also good with the bourbon maple syrup ;)

Overall I was really impressed, especially since I'm not generally fond of the typically heavy, greasy Southern fare. Yardbird really elevates Southern food to another level.",ofZzcj1oiHS64f7jbGCXxQ,3,3,5,jve1WsnmZPP9DjcfnjqnOA

5424156,2018-01-22,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"BLUF: Get a table away from the casino floor. They have lots of sharable plates, so going with others and sharing really elevates the experience. It's not cheap, so I recommend coming when you have time to relax and enjoy.

Preface: I was contacted by the owner who seemed to genuinely care that I didn't have a wonderful experience and wanted to address my concerns. I happened to be in Vegas anyway so I decided that I would give this place another try and brought a friend to see how that effected the experience.

We arrived around 6:30pm and the restaurant wasn't overly crowded. We got a table in the back, far away from the casino floor. I highly recommend this as it resolved my issues with the loudness and smoke wafting in from the casino. 

Service: The service was still top notch. Everyone was extremely polite and attentive.

Food: Two things here. 1) Coming here with other people makes it a lot better. The family style apps/sides/dessert make sense with multiple people and allows you to get a few different things to try. 2) To really test if my first experience was a fluke (my original issues were pretty minor from my point of view) I ordered the steak. I almost never order steak out as more often than not I end up disappointed so this would be a challenge. I'm happy to report that I've never had a steak cooked so perfectly. The meat was tender and juicy and was just as delicious when I heated it up the next day (it's a big steak). The peach cobbler takes about 25 minutes to make (says so on the menu) but is absolutely worth the wait. 

Overall this was actually one the best restaurant experiences I've had in the last few years. We must have spent 2-3 hours here and had a great time. I think this is where this place really shines. It's a restaurant designed around sharable plates and having a dining experience. I probably wouldn't come back if I was looking for just a quick meal for myself, but would absolutely return if I wanted a dining experience to share with others.",2KquSGfWJt9g0_CoQ1X82A,1,1,5,IGj5K13g3dU5UFhfF4cnGg

First of all, I had requested a booth when I made my reservation, and while there were plenty available, including a perfect one for my party of three, they seated us at a regular table top.  We requested to switch to the booth for three, though, and they were able to accommodate us.  Second, I later found out my Open Table reservation for our dinner was cancelled even though I checked in at the hostess stand (?), so I was not awarded my Open Table points and I now have to get this resolved :/  This has never happened to me before!

Most of all, the food was just not that good.  We ordered their Deviled Eggs, Grits, and Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles.  I've had better deviled eggs from just about everywhere :p  The grits were just ok - nothing special about them.  While I was eating their chicken, I was wishing I was eating Popeye's Chicken instead :p  It came with honey hot sauce on the side, which made it less blah but it still wasn't all that great.  As for their waffle, I don't know if it was the waffle or the syrup or what, but how could you go wrong with a waffle?!  It left a bad taste in my mouth.  It came with some kind of relish on top.  I'm not a relish person so I only had one bite with the relish - the waffle tasted even worse with it!  Then there was the watermelon.  I love me some watermelon!  Not theirs though!  It was some kind of ""spiced watermelon"" - not for me.

Note: I like my food no frills and basic.  My palate is not too sophisticated lol.  If you're like me this place probably won't tickle your fancy too much.  Read the descriptions for the menu items and these dishes are not all that basic.  Was expecting things to taste better than they did, though.

Another note:  This place serves their dishes family style and it was more than enough for three girls to share.

While I wasn't crazy about the main part of our meal, the dessert was pretty good!  I had my heart set on trying their bacon-butterscotch cake, but one of my dining companions was set on having their ice cream sundae.  Luckily, we were able to substitute their hot fudge for butterscotch sauce :)  I forgot the name of our sundae but it came with a shortbread cookie, caramelized banana, caramel popcorn, and a couple of different flavors of ice cream.  Yum!!

Entree split: Chicken and Waffles. 4 pieces of chicken. Fried chicken was very juicy and well-cooked, albeit not seasoned. So while they didh't have a flavor, they were still good. 

Other Yelpers had mentioned that the cheddar cheese waffle was hard. Ours was no exception. Because they had cooked it for so long, the cheese got very hard and made our waffle tough -- it was hard to cut through. We mentioned this to our waitress and banged on them with our utensils to accentuate our finding. They brought us out a new one. Now this second one was great! It was perfectly cooked, soft, looked really cheesy, and the cheese stretched when you cut into it, and could actually taste it. Our first one was basically a dark, plain waffle with a hard cookie consistency. 

For me, I could taste the bourbon in the syrup, yum. Hubs was like, meh, but then I don't drink. He also didn't care for the herbed watermelon, I kinda liked it. All in all, this would have gotten 4 stars if they got this order right the first time. If our entree came out with the perfectly cooked waffle, I would say this was a solid entree.

Tomato was still crunchy-probably due to panko type batter instead of flour or cornmeal which requires more time in the grease and a softer tomato. 5. Collard greens and cornbread were the highlight of the meal!

I went there planning on getting the blackberry lemonade, but then a rum drink with banana and walnut caught my eye. I asked the waitress which was better/more popular and she warned that the banana walnut was pretty sweet. Well I like sweet, so I figured, if she's comparing those two drinks and thinks one is sweeter, I'll trust that. Well I hadn't noticed that it was an ""old fashioned"" so was basically two fingers of straight rum - not exactly what I would ever describe as sweet when you compare it to a lemonade cocktail. It was my own fault for reading the menu too quickly, but that description from the server was odd to me....

On to the food. we'd heard so much about the chicken, my bf got the crunchy chicken sandwich and he really liked it. Again, I asked my server for her recommendation (we ordered drinks and food at the same time, so I didn't know yet that I wasn't a fan of her recommendations haha) between the smoked chicken salad (to try the fab chicken here) or the shrimp and grits.

We have never had to wait more than a few minutes and the service has always been great. I have seen it grow in popularity over the past few years but our last experience with the food makes me wonder if we will be back. 

Granted this visit was last year but I felt it was necessary to review. As always we ordered a sampling of items which includes Lewellyn's fried chicken, biscuits, fries, and something else that was on special but I forgot what it was. While the other items were fine the fried chicken this time was not good and I now regret not sending it back. I should have realized when it came out so quickly after ordering. While I can appreciate this, when one pays $26 for a half chicken it is expected to be piping hot and fresh...unfortunately this wasn't. I'd gladly wait longer for something freshly fried versus a batch that has been sitting out for a while. Again, my mistake for not mentioning anything but we were hungry. 

Other than this, Yardbird is a solid place to go to when staying at the Venetian or Palazzo. I just am not sure if we will be going there again.",nG1TDmf1EYI0595xuzhyLw,0,0,2,O2XBw5AtWk-n3bJmgVlMDA

The meal was so good that my husband and I went back again the next day. We tried the dulce de leche waffle w/out the chocolate drizzle, potato and bacon hash and a side of chicken. My husband ordered the peach drink this time which wasn't half as good as the whiskey sour drink the day before. The waffle had a good flavor but it was soggy and the portion was really small.

Kids and I love good fried chicken and honestly, this place did not disappoint!!!

We ordered:
Smoked Brisket
Crispy Chicken
Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles
Skillet Cornbread
Macaroni & Cheese

I have to say, they served THE BEST biscuits!! They tasted so butter, were flaky and fluffy!! 
The chicken was the star of the show!!! Cooked perfectly and was so moist and juicy!

Service was great. Before we ordered, we were able to move to a different location in the lounge and not in the main walk way. Eating on 2 small tables wasn't so bad but would have been better if we were at a regular table.

I had made reservations ahead of time. My BF and I came her our last night in Vegas on a Monday night so we were greeted a seated right away. The decor was beautiful and very ""Southern"". Mason jars everywhere, little quotes here and there and there was even beautiful linen napkins on each table. The restaurant ambiance was just perfect, extremely cozy and inviting. The kind of place that made you want to stay for awhile. It was also immaculately clean. Once seated we were greeted by our server, given menus and time to think:

The menu is pretty awesome and we had a hard time not ordering everything... Though we tried (it was our first meal of the day and we were hungover = starving!). Most items are meant to be shared. We ordered the following:

APPETIZERS 

Frog Legs: These were absolutely amazing! The meat was juicy and flavorful and the skin was light, crispy and perfectly seasoned. The best appetizer we ordered that night. 

Roasted Bone Marrow: Very rich, unctuous, and savory. It went perfect with the grilled toast it was served with. I also took my BF's bone marrow V card! This was the first time he had ever had it! Now he's hooked!

Deviled Eggs: These were delicious. Super rich and the perfect amount of salt. They were HUGE. 

MAINS AND SIDES:

Fried Chicken: Of course we had to get the chicken. This was what they were known for. It was good. Juicy, Crispy and Flavorful. The hot sauce it came with was crack and I wish I had my own personal bottle to carry around in my purse. It wasn't the best I've ever had in my life but it is pretty high up there on my fried chicken list.

St Louis style Pork Ribs: These were freaking delicious. Juicy, tender, meaty and addicting. They had great texture and mouthfeel. The sauce on the ribs was just perfect, smoky and luscious. I liked the ribs better than the chicken!

Big Ol Cheddar Waffle: This was okay. A little too sweet for my taste and the cheese was overwhelming the waffle. I kinda wish the had a plain buttermilk waffle option. The bourbon maple syrup it came with however was wonderful and I used it to dip my chicken in. It was unlike any other maple syrup I've ever had... You can really taste the bourbon.

House Cut Fries: These were hella bomb. Super crunchy on the outside and fluffy like mashed potatoes in the inside. They were also seasoned perfectly... That bacon salt... Wow.

Service was good. Our server was very engaging, friendly and helpful. He checked in on us often and always made sure we had everything we needed. I also felt like the prices weren't bad, especially for Las Vegas. Our meal was pretty much close to perfect. Well played Yardbird... Well played...

It's been a couple of years since I enjoyed a meal so much at a restaurant.  We had a reservation in advance but were pleased to get a single big table to accommodate all 12 of us (actually 1 person didn't show up but the restaurant didn't give us a hard time with seating us anyway).  

Cocktails were exceptional - I first tried their cocktail that had hints of banana and rum, which actually came together great.  Their version of an old fashioned was also spot on; I order this drink at a lot of places and this was one of my favorites, and it was fun to get the huge ice sphere inside.

Since we had a larger party I got to try multiple appetizers, including a fancy version of deviled eggs, and the BLT with fried green tomatoes.  The BLT with fried green tomatoes was mind-blowing; pork belly pieces were thick, well-seasoned and not too fatty.  The chicken and waffles was perfect - chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and also came with a spicy sauce on the side that added flavor but wasn't overpowering.  The waffle was composed of a special batter that lends itself to the chicken (this isn't some IHOP waffle), and the syrup was on the lighter side and not too thick.  My wife was over the moon to be able to order gluten free fried chicken (she can't usually have it), and she enjoyed every bite.  Since my wife and I were freshly married, they also threw in a few desserts for the table to share, which was a nice touch (somehow I wasn't bloated enough to eat some of these).

I can't even reach to think of anything that could have been improved - check this place out, even if you're not that close to the Venetian.",9eXjRkZQjmaiLHy6nRKESw,0,0,5,EuS-uLmp0Xdnhf9dxEt3kQ

5515012,2018-05-07,10,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"As we scrolled through Yelp to find where to go for breakfast, it didn't take long for me to jump on board with Yardbird.  In part because I had already bookmarked them during a previous trip to Vegas, but also because...why not?  Overwhelmingly positive reviews, tantalizing photos on Yelp, a new place to write about, and, of course, FRIED CHICKEN!  How in the world could I ever say no to that?  Or rather, why would I ever WANT to?!

Now, to say that Yardbird is all about fried chicken would be a serious understatement.  Whether it's their brunch, lunch, or supper menu, you'll find those golden fried birds offered multiple times in some shape or manner.  With so many delicious offerings sprinkled throughout their brunch menu, it practically took me 15 minutes to finally decide on what to get.  However, given how it's only offered for brunch, as well as our ""southern"" setting, I opted to get their BISCUITS & GRAVY ($24).

While the description on the menu sounded delicious (open-faced biscuit, country gravy, crispy chicken thigh, two poached farmer's eggs), I had no idea that the portion was be GIGANTIC as well!  Thankfully, it tasted as good as it looked!  The batter may not have been very crispy, but the chicken was great - well-seasoned and really juicy.  What's more, the gravy was so flavorful!  What impressed me the most though was the biscuit - a bit dense, but not very heavy or dry.  This was so filling though, I definitely regretted not splitting this with my friend so that we could both try two things.

Beyond our food, I thought service was pretty solid.  The hostess was really friendly and our server was super nice and welcoming.  I also like the decor - a bit of a southern farmhouse feel with a bit of hipster touch and a very chill vibe.  If there was one downside to our experience, it was that we had a sort of a lounge table, as opposed to a typical sort of four-top.  Far better than having to wait for seats (they're pretty popular), but sharing the table was a little tough.

All in all, despite having only only had one dish (and a bite of my friends' Fried Green Tomato BLT, which was very....average), consider me a fan of Yardbird.  Admittedly, they're a little pricey, but not all that bad given where you are (it's Vegas, after all) and the giant portion.  Whether it's to try more of their brunch menu or to explore what they have to offer for lunch and supper, I'll most definitely make my way back here!

I came at brunch time and had a mimosa and a fried chicken sandwich.  I would not recommend the sandwich: the fries were good but the chicken was lukewarm, and some of the other food I saw going by looked delicious (biscuit sandwiches, chicken waffles & watermelon plate, etc.) and much more impressive.  If you're on the fence, definitely go bigger and get one of their signature items.  Also, word to the wise: mimosas are $13!

When I checked in for my first visit I went with their special which was fried chicken on biscuit with gravy . The kicker : any style eggs on the side. This hit the spot and was exactly what I wanted because I went their for a very late breakfast (2pm it was vegas don't judge ) 

Service was on point from start to finish. My coffee came out literally under 2 minutes after I ordered it. I came the second time but this time I sat at the bar and watched some football with the servers. This time ( late breakfast again) I got the elvis 77' pancakes and they were amazing.

Came here for the much vaunted fried chicken. Quite disappointed really. Most fried chicken places will warn you that it will take twenty to twenty-five minutes before your order is ready. At Yardbird, it took five minutes from ordering to being served, which immediately signaled the fact that the chicken was fried in advance and kept in a warming oven. The chicken skin was soft instead of crispy as a result, like the kind you'd get at KFC. The chicken pieces were warm instead of piping hot. The french fries were limp too. For two orders of fried chicken and drinks, the bill was about one-hundred twenty dollars. Definitely over the top for mediocre, almost cold, fried chicken. I would not have minded the price as much if the fried chicken had been what it was reported to be. I recommend this restaurant but not their fried chicken.",EAhCYdZwwlB6OH6gt5ehNA,0,0,3,Duk4SYbdhMnOMPJELbNXOg

That mouthwatering anticipation when I picked up a delicious piece with my bare hands knowing full well that my life would undoubtedly be better in a few seconds was semi-thrilling.  

The light crunch from the breading, the crispy skin, and the juiciness of the bird meat had my eyes rolling.  It didn't matter; breast, thigh, wing, leg....I was an equal opportunity eater that did not discriminate.  Shit!  I'd make do with a couple of chicken necks if these guys were frying them up.

If I were to be the bearer of bad news, having the ""Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles"" plate brought out as soon as I stuck it to them would definitely soften the blow.  Maybe Yardbird should set up a delivery program where every human resources department in the valley could put in an order.  Laying off 20 people?  You get fried chicken and you get fried chicken and all the rest of you fired motherfuckers get fried chicken! 

This procedure could work just as well when breaking up with someone in the restaurant.

The fries came out first and were the perfect snack after sitting in a seminar all day. The bacon salt offers the right oomph to take the average fry to the next level.

But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!

I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.

No, the powers of Gordon Ramsey continue strong as the winner of his show Hell's Kitchen runs the kitchen as yardbird, at least as far as I know. So while it's not a GR establishment, it certainly lives up to the pedigree.

Fried Green Tomato BLT- house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, frisée, pimento cheese, pickled lemon vinaigrette. Christ just orgasmic.

Skillet Cornbread- vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon, jalapeño, honey maple butter. You won't find better corn bread anywhere out west.

Crispy Chicken Pepper Jelly Biscuits- could've used more pepper jelly but still delicious.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles-honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup. The fried chicken is dope...the syrup I could eat with a spoon. 

Shrimp 'n' Grits- seared shrimp, roasted tomatoes, virginia ham, nora mill grits, pbr chicken jus. It is heavy, it is rich, it is coma inducing, it is sexy.

We ordered the classic biscuits, and deviled eggs to start. My husband had the special whiskey manhattan. I had a bloody Mary. Our friends had a spicy blood Mary and some blueberry drink. Biscuits were delicious, came in an order of four. There was an apple jam/butter that was spot on. I'm actually salivating right now. The eggs were so good. The presentation was spot on. I want to say that they put a little pickle juice that gives it a nice little tartness. Again, mouth is salivating. 

Drinks were worthy. I enjoyed my blood Mary. It was a meal in itself. No one complained about their drinks. 

For our brunch, we ordered so much food. My husband had the chicken and waffles. I had the shrimp and grits. Our friends had the crunchy chicken sandwich and chicken wings. The chicken and waffles is enough for two but delicious. The watermelon cuts the grease feeling and is really refreshing. My shrimp and grits was really well made. The grits was perfection. The shrimp was delicious and I believe a good 6-8 came with it. The wings were spot on with the honey hot sauce. It was an incredible recommendation by Nicholas. 

We also had fries and some mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was really good but I think it could have been skipped because we had so much other good food in front of us.

Our experience here got a better as time went by as it didn't really start good. When we first arrived, we were told that the wait would be 2 hours. We had an earlier reservation that day but we needed to change it around to accommodate our entire group. So, we had already arrived an hour earlier, anticipating the wait time. (Please make a reservation and DON'T miss it)

While we waited, we went over to the bar and ordered some drinks and appetizers. We were waiting for about 30 minutes when another group came into the restaurant. This group was for 8 people like ours. They were also told the wait was 2 hours and also offered a space to sit in the lounge or couch area where they could sit and have dinner. This immediately made me upset. Here we are waiting for 30 minutes, and drinking and eating, and nobody has offered us anything! So I immediately approached the manager, a guy, and said, ""hey, we've been waiting for what we thought was a two hour wait and another group as large as ours was just offered a couch area..."" He says, ""oh, well they were in front of me at the time and that space is first come first serve"" My rebuttal was that, we had actually arrived first, but he seemed very nonchalant and had no desire to address my concern. 

We finally got a table after another reservation didn't show up. Luckily, our honoree was running a bit late so it appeared that we had everything set up before she arrived. The food was really really good. The portions were so large we ordered everything to share. Our waitress was AMAZING. Her name was Caroline. She really turned around our entire experience and is certainly a 5 star employee. She gave amazing suggestions for menu items. She was really attentive to our honoree and her bridal celebration. She brought out complimentary Peach Cobbler Shots for our celebration. She also gave really good leads for after party entertainment. I was really satisfied with the food and the overall dining experience. 

The restaurant was really really clean. I ordered the fried chicken and the grilled green beans, but we also had kale salad, mac and cheese, ribs and several orders of deviled eggs.

You HAVE to get this if you're eating at Yardbird. Portion was big enough for my boyfriend and I to split. I think it came with 4 pieces of chicken.

Huge portion and delicious sides. The string beans were surprisingly good!

My friends and I were in Vegas for a combined bachelorette/bachelor party a few weeks ago and all the bride to be wanted to do was go see Magic Mike on Saturday night and then go get brunch with everyone at the Yardbird Southern Table & Bar. 

It's located in the Venetian, close to the Uber/Lyft pickup area. We got our own private room, which was pretty cool, and it fit about 20 of us. I loved the set up and decor of it. 

The menu was pretty big, with so many options! I had the hardest time deciding what I wanted to get. I started with a Bloody Mary. Definitely get it if you need the hair of a dog to get you through brunch. I had a sip of my friend's Old Fashion with Angel's Envy whisky and that was so smooth, I was tempted to order that as well. We had the bacon to start as an appetizer - holy fuck. It's not JUST bacon. This bacon was so crispy, yet melted in your mouth at the same time. It was one of the best bacon strips I had ever had. It was so good. After much contemplation, I ordered the Char-Grilled Churrasco, which included sunny side up farm fresh eggs, bacon hash brown potato cake grilled green onion, sour cream. Everything about it was amazing. So good.

Service was awesome. Our server kept coming to check in on us and he always made sure we had drinks. It wouldn't be Sunday Funday without shots, right? And we had plenty of that. That flight back 4 hours later was not fun for me. Anyways. Service was great. Food was awesome. Prices are expected for a fancy brunch place and Vegas.

The menu boasted about southern cocktails and comfort food favorites like shrimp and grits, peach cobbler and famous fried chicken. 

The theme of the restaurant is a upscale southern parlor. There is a bar that features plush couches with chicken feathers in the seams. There's a projector with Elvis and other artists. 

We arrived at 11 and were seated immediately.  We were informed of the famous chicken dishes and my party of 4 decided on the fried chicken, Mama's chicken biscuits and Mac & Cheese. 2 of my friends ordered a mimosa and Southern Peach cocktail. The southern peach cocktail was served with thyme and a lemon garnish. Sweet and tasty. The Mac & Cheese was delicious!  Lives up to the hype. Very similar to how the Haitian culture makes Gratin Macaroni and Cheese. Large noodles, thick like a casserole and oozing with cheese and flavor. 

The biscuits were thick and similar to the texture of a scone.  The service here was Excellent. I really wish the brunch featured more options and cocktail specials.",7fmAcPFBDbHWp8nxWVv2gg,6,5,4,YilOgUAnVYwUXAXB8NDInw

For food, we ordered quite a few things.  To start, we went with the deviled eggs and burnt ends.  I didn't eat the burnt ends but was told it was amazing.  The deviled eggs were pretty good, too. (But then again, I love most deviled eggs, gas station ones excepted.)

For mains, the four of us shared a regular order of fried chicken, another order of fried chicken with the watermelon and waffles, and the shrimp and grits.  Sides were Brussels sprouts and cauliflower mash.

Color me impressed by the fried chicken.  It was flavorful through and through.  You did not need any of the sauces you were given.The waffles and the nice, chilled/spiced watermelon also deserve honorable mention.  My mom who doesn't like sweet things, was a huge fan of the bourbon maple syrup.

Shrimp and grits were tasty as well.  It's slightly different than other versions I've had, tending to be more on the buttery side versus the spicy side  

I thought the sides were pretty delicious as well.  The cauliflower mashed could have fooled me - the guy who delivered the dish said there was no potato in it at all!  The Brussels sprouts were nicely done and had a hint of sweetness.

Definitely a nice option if you're in the area and craving fried chicken.  This ain't no Popeyes (which I love) which means it'll be a bit more stress on the wallet but it's totally worth it!",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,2,2,4,qql93t_g6FxogcMrqZ7Ugg

- Skillet Cornbread
- Chicken + Watermelon + Waffles

OVERALL:
- Pictures do not lie. Yelper's posted delicious photos of Yardbird's signature dish, the chicken and waffles. Everything looked so good on the menu that we ended up sharing our entrée. For starters we ordered the Deviled Eggs topped with Smoked Trout Roe. The roe was a very nice touch and gave the deviled eggs a nice twist at the end. Would recommend! The Skillet Cornbread was soft and sweet. I wouldn't let the bacon jalepeno throw you off. If you like cornbread you will not be disappointed. Order it to share, someone is bound to love it. The Chicken + Watermelon + Waffles were amazing. The Chilled Spiced Watermelon was surprisingly delicious. The Bourbon Maple syrup was insanely good with the Vermont Sharp Cheddar Cheese Waffles. Next on the menu was the Peach Cobbler. You will need to order this in advance as it takes 25 mins to make. When we received the dessert we were already quite full but could not wait to try their take on this classic dish. The cobbler arrived with a side of homemade vanilla ice cream and cinnamon twist. Both were delicious. The cobbler was very good. But may need to skip if you are too full.

Yardbird, a traditional Southern eatery for themed decor, chicken & waffles, grits & more, plus craft cocktails.

- Waffle and Crispy Chicken, pepper jelly

- Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken, 1/2 of our famous bird served with honey hot sauce - their infamous chicken dish.

- Fried Green Tomato BLT -house smoked pork belly, smoky tomato jam, pimento cheese, frisée lemon vinaigrette - a must order.

- Deviled Eggs - dill, chive, smoked trout roe

- Skillet Cornbread - Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon jalapeño, honey maple butter - after this, you'll be like ""WHAT HANGOVER?"" 

- Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad - char-grilled mango, smoked pecans, tomatoes, red onion, benne seed vinaigrette. This was such a refreshing and nice surprise dish. The flavor and texture will surely wake you up.

So if anyone is on that list and needs a substitute I am your gal I digress The food is delicious like best Southern Food infused with a modern flair I felt the taste was so delicious it is like when they say ""pinch me this has to be a dream"" Except I was saying if this is a dream don't you dare pinch me!!!!!

More than happy that I did. I took my whole family and we had such an amazing experience here! From the ambience, the service, and the food! Omg, the food!!! All around outstanding! Came here near lunch peak hours- noonish and with a party of 9. We didn't make any reservations, we just came. Hostess was very pleasant, led us to sit in the lounge area while we waited. I was expecting a long wait since we had a big party, but not even. About 15-20min. But all the while we had 2 different people tell us that they were working on a table for us which was nice to know they didn't just brush us off aside and forgot about us. While we waited I had a chance to sit and admire the ambience and decor. I love the trendy farmhouse theme. Tasteful wood Barndoors, lanterns.. love it! Everything was spaced out so well that even being so crowded it was comfortable. When we were finally brought to our seating area we were all just amazed... just delightful. We were walked into our own private what felt like VIP room. Long dining table, classic movie stars like Elvis flashing on a mirrored projector, whiskey cabinet display on one wall, wine cellar displayed on the other. What an amazing room.. all for us to enjoy privately.. how did we get so lucky!?! 
Right away we were greeted by our awesome waitress. She went over the menu with us and some recommendations with food and drinks. There were so many items I wanted to try based off my fellow Yelpers photos that we decided to dine family style so we can try everything.  Now let's talk food....
-Chicken n' Waffles n' Watermelon $36 (5/5 stars)
The whole dish was perfection. Ginormous serving size. Chicken was brined and fried, drizzled ever so lightly with a honey glaze. Crispy, moist, flavorful.. absolutely delicious. Waffles... what the heck is in that recipe! Seriously the best waffles I've ever had. I kept biting and dissecting, wonderful flavors were just kicking on the pallet. Vermont cheese, they put Vermont cheese!...just the perfect amount in their waffles adding just the right flavor and perfect crisp to every single bite. N' the watermelon... it was just any watermelon. It was a nice addition that went very well and just brought the whole dish together. The watermelon, simple yet delightful was drizzled or sprinkled with various herbs and spices. 
-Shrimp n' Grits $28 (5/5 stars)
Another fantastic dish. Full of flavor , tickling all tastebuds. I usually don't like grits, it's just now I realized because I've been eating the wrong grits in the wrong places. However Yardbird prepared their grits here I loved it. The texture was perfect, not too gritty or loose in consistency, and the taste was savory. Shrimp, large and in charge! Excellent quality shrimp, you can taste it, cooked very well
-Smoked brisket sandwich $17 (4/5 stars)
Brisket was smoked nicely, tasty, not chewy. I'm not a fan of ciabatta, hence the star deduction. 
-Mac n' cheese app $10 
Estimated 1.5C portion. My kids request. Nice presentation brought out on a mini wood board and cooked in a cast iron skillet. Nice crisp cheese and Pablo topping, creamy inside
-Fried okra app (5/5 stars)
I like how this was lightly and not overly battered and the texture of the actual okra was not over cooked or too slimy. Nice bite sized addictive pieces
-Fried Green Tomato BLT $14 (5/5 stars)
A must have when your here! A simple humble dish that Yardbird has spruced up! Definitely not your average fried green tomatoes. Lightly breaded adding just the right crisp as you bite into a cooked to al dente tang green tomato. Topped with a yummy not too fatty perfect piece of pork belly, and they added a little frisée and their tomato jam to tickle your fancy. 
I seriously love this place! And so does my whole family! 
There's always a party somewhere in Vegas. This time there was a party in my mouth and a dance club going on in my stomach. Thank you Yardbird for the experience!",vhWv4sa7nCVow15gggzcrA,19,18,5,S2W-nnKHDbe5GeFRgSyksw

The mac n cheese was the driest i have ever had...so much so the waiter removed it from my bill. Now...the chicken...omg...so moist. It comes on top of this spicy honey..very good.

They were large and super yummy with lots of ham and other condiments. They were definitely a Five. My husband had the chicken and waffles which was another FIVE - chicken was really flavorful and the combination of it with the waffle was super. The spicy watermelon hit just the right note with the chicken and waffle flavors.  I had the shrimp and grits and it's the reason I didn't give them a total five star review. The shrimp and grits just had no flavor! I asked for salt and pepper - which helped a little. When I added some of the sauce for the chicken from my husband's plate, it became much better. I noticed that the couple at the next table also asked for salt and pepper for the shrimp/grits, so I wasn't the only one who found it lacking. Overall , this place is great and we will definitely be going back.

After making a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, we hit Yardbird on a Saturday night. It was packed and rightfully so. 

We were instantly greeted and seated. The decor is like... modern southern? If that's a thing? Anyway, it's super cute. We were in the area with the mason jar lights, which made my inner crafty girl want to come out for an at home project. 

For some reason we didn't anticipate that the dishes were large enough to share. So started with the Mac and Cheese then each ordered a chicken dish. He got the regular fried chicken and I go the Chicken, Watermelon and Waffles. First off, that Mac and Cheese was heavenly. It was served with bread crumbs on top and had excellent flavor. The watermelon that came with mine was marinated with some sort of spicy goodness, so each bite was a spicy bite followed by the sweetness of watermelon. Then the waffles are cheddar waffles, and were amazing dipped in the bourbon maple syrup or the hot sauce. But the chicken is the real winner. It was SO GOOD. I also got their bourbon blackberry lemonade which did not tasty boozy at all and I could have easily had like 5 of them. 

If you can, go to Yardbird. It is amazing and you will not be disappointed! Depending on your appetite, you miiiiiight want to share the chicken and order several sides to share.

Whether you call it glorified or gourmet - Yardbird definitely brought new class (modern interpretation of classic) for the southern cuisine. From the atmosphere (dimly lit, classy, yet relaxing, definitely got the southern charm), service (they are on top of the hospitality game - although we didn't get to interact with our server much on my visit, I've heard about their exceptional service from my friend who had visited a week earlier - waiter's assistant was very attentive, our waters & beverages were refilled quickly), & food (fresh quality ingredients that are carefully executed = great dish) 
We started our supper with the fried green tomato BLT. Those delightful fried green tomatoes were perfect appetizer to start with. The tart green tomato fried to perfection atop pork belly - rich pork with tart fried tomatoes, texture & taste nailed it!!  Main entree was their fried chicken. They seasoned the good bird well and fried (temperature was not hot - which was a bit disappointing but it was delicious). I loved the waffles & spiced watermelon combo!! Don't forget to drizzle some of their house syrup~ the refreshing spiced  watermelon completes the sweet & savory game.  Corn bread in the skillet was moist, had sweetness of corn, lil heat from the jalapenos (for a skillet corn bread, it wasn't hot - it would had been so awesome if it came out hot), and mac & cheese was the perfectly cooked pasta with rich, creamy, golden cheese smothered goodness!
So minus the temperature issues - a very enjoyable supper!!

Fried chicken + waffles + watermelon for $36. Ehhh . Fried chicken is good but not Popeyes good. 

Mac and cheese- bomb. Not too cheesy or overwhelming as it looks. 

Deviled eggs with salmon roe: basic. Bacon would've been a better topping. Just saying. 

Caesar Salad wedge - gross. don't know how can you go wrong with this but don't make this salad fancy when it doesn't have to be. 

Short rib- best American short rib. Well executed loaded with so much flavor! The green beans had candied walnuts too so that was Delish! Usually short rib is bland and no place I've been to has ever been good. 

Pork BBQ ribs- bomb!!! How can you go wrong?

Seconds after being escorted to our table, our waitress appeared. She was friendly and explained the menu/concept to us as this was our first time here.Throughout our time at the restaurant, she was very attentive which was great. Other staff bringing our food and refilling our beverages were wonderful as well. 

Food was amazing! Everything on the menu sounded good, so I wasn't sure what to order. Decided on the fried green tomato BLT to start, followed by Lewellyn's fine fried chicken, mac & cheese, and mama's classic buttermilk biscuits. Although I had no complaints about any of the food ordered and enjoyed everything I ate, my favorite dish had to be the fried green tomato BLT (3/order). The tomato wasn't too thick or thin, wasn't overly coated with breading, and was crispy. I enjoyed the pimento cheese and tomato jam, with each tomato having just the right amount of each. The smoked pork belly on top was the icing on the cake. There was a generous piece on top of each fried green tomato. Everything on this BLT went well with each other. So good! 

Lewellyn's fine fried chicken is half a chicken, so it's meant to be shared family-style. This dish came with a breast and a mix of wings, legs, and thighs. Depending on how hungry you are, it can be shared between 2-3 people. It was crispy, not oily, and had great flavor to it. The honey hot sauce was a good dipping sauce for the dish, but wasn't necessary. It could have been spicier, though. The mac & cheese again was good. With 5 cheese, it was creamy, but not overly cheesy. Mama's classic buttermilk biscuits (4/order) didn't disappoint.These biscuits were hot, fluffy, and moist. Although they didn't need them, spreading the honey butter and house-made jam onto them made them taste that much better.

I also tried their '77 Elvis pancakes, which I surprisingly enjoyed. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but these were tasty! The chocolate chip pancakes were fluffy, not dense. Loved the banana compote and that there was a generous amount of it. Drizzled with the bourbon maple syrup and PB, this was one good dish. I only had a couple bites, but definitely could have eaten it all by myself.

Food and service here was excellent. The only thing I didn't understand was why the drinks were so expensive. Yes this is Vegas. Yes Yardbird is located in the Venetian. However, $6 soft drinks and a $17 bloody mary is kind of insane. Save your money for the food and wash everything down with some water!",DihTsliUxbqpoA9W3uRDBA,9,7,5,ZajCSq__CHJDgeKPSGlM4g

The food is enjoyable but it's pretty pricey.  

Beef Brisket Biscuits - $15 - Slightly above average, 3.5/5
-Serves 2 biscuits w/ beef brisket.  The biscuits are really good & soft; very moist & lots of butter.  I enjoyed this dish but not worth the hefty $15 price tag.

Fried Chicken - $26 - Slightly above average, 3.5/5
-I enjoyed the fried chicken.  The breading was really good & the chicken was really moist & tender.  It comes w/ about 4 pieces of chicken.  While enjoyable, I'm not sure its worth the hefty price tag.

5736792,2015-01-26,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I got seriously excited after seeing all the glowing reviews and learning that Yardbird served brunch! You see, my girls and I do brunch once a month and are always on the lookout for something new and exciting. We showed up at 11am on a Sunday (per the website this is the opening time). It looked like they had been open for some time and we were asked by a rather rude hostess if we had reservations. We don't normally consider making brunch reservations, many places around the valley don't even offer brunch reservations. We advised that we didn't and she let us know that they were ""fully committed"" until 11:45. We asked if we could sit at the empty bar and she advised again that they were ""fully committed."" OK, we had to ask if there was a waiting list and she advised to just come back at 11:45 so we walked away. It then occurred to us that we would probably be turned away again, so we went back in and spoke with a much nicer hostess who took our name and number and advised she would call if they had anything earlier. 

We were finally seated at 11:45, at a table that had been empty for at least 15 minutes. When we were seated we noticed that there were actually a lot of empty tables, I guess it's a little exclusive, meaning you have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated even if the restaurant is empty. The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. I loved the rustic Southern decor and the really cool lighting fixtures. The front portion of the restaurant has a porch and parlor like feel with couches and arm chairs. Then it blends into communal tables and finally some general restaurant tables. I personally think the parlor area is a waste of space, nobody wants to eat in arm chairs with tiny tables. They should consider making more tables, since there is such a long wait. 

We were seated at a high top table behind the communal tables and I was surprised how small the table was since most dishes serve 2 - 4 people. We ordered a few items to split between the 3 of us and there was barely room on our table. We started with the Blackberry Bourbon lemonade, which was definitely a heavy pour from the bar, always a good thing. I also enjoyed an $11 mimosa, which apparently they only have on the weekends. 

We did enjoy the food, the mama's chicken biscuits were really tasty, but there was way too much biscuit. I was especially fond of their house made pickles, so perfectly balanced. The mac and cheese had a weird orange color but was super tasty, I could have eaten one myself. The eggs and ham was fine, the ham was tasty and the grits were OK, but nothing special. We also ordered the corn bread but it never made it to our table. Our waitress was less than apologetic, but we decided we would just switch it out for the cinnamon apple hand pies. There were only 2, so we had to do a little math, but we split them up and enjoyed them. I really liked them, although there could have been a bit more apple flavor. 

Overall, the food was pretty good, but not for the price. The menu suggests sharing, but the portions are a little on the small side. The service also wasn't that great, we had a few questions and our server told us she would ask but never came back with answers. I really like the decor and the food, wish they would lower their prices or at least offer a locals discount. It seems that they are catering to the one and done tourist crowd. This definitely won't be on the brunch rotation.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,3,1,3,Ww9PgXJey6eHoq04IQyQJg

I'd say that and the ribs... Which we didn't order, but a friend did and we stole... because they were so good! We also ordered the chicken, waffles and watermelon, which was crispy and moist, plus the waffles were awesome.

The absolute only reason it didn't receive the 5th star from me is that the mac n' cheese and gnocchi pot pie and fell a little flat. The gnocchi seemed out of place, almost like a middle eastern inspired dish. Not southern at all. It was good, but just didn't mesh with the other items on the menu. 

I also ordered an old fashion, which was on point. The only thing we thought was weird was that they really pushed the desserts on us, HARD... Right when we got sat. Their schtick was that the one dessert needed to bake for 30 minutes, or something like that. I get it... Up-sell. But, it came off annoying.

Some how my open table reservations got lost in outer space but the wait was minimal. 

Shortly after being sat, we met our waiter. He had a peculiar attitude throughout our meal. He seemed annoyed to be serving, he provided 0 commentary even when the table made comments to which any other waiter would have had a response to. Maybe just a bad night?

Drinks

Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade:  I could really end it at that. The flavor matches the name and the alcohol's presence was enough. Refreshing. 4/5

Southern Peach: The bourbon in this takes over the lightness of the peach puree and sweet tea, it's distribution is in chaser form. 3.5/5 

Food

Mac and Cheese: The 5 different cheeses made it sloppy and scary since I can only eat measured out amounts of dairy. But the taste was good. I enjoyed it at a normal degree but the rest of my table fell in love with it. 3.5/5

Bone Marrow: The onion marmalade surprised me in taste. It has a light sweetness to it that went too magically well with the bone marrow on toast. It's good enough to turn people into bone marrow fans. The portion was big and it cost less than a drink, souther oddities. 4.75/5

Smoked Brisket Biscuits: The brisket was a hands full. Their ""homemade"" bbq sauce was low on the tang but the cleanliness of the brisket made up for it. The biscuits had a fresh taste but nothing that would have me ordering a side to go. 4/5

I wanted to taste their take on the ribs but with a long night ahead of me, that would of been a bad idea. This is a spot to get your night started. I treated it as more of a drinks and apps place but it wouldn't be bad to spend an early dinner here either. The ambiance is perfect and the selection of drinks is not bad.

There's a projector on the one side of the restaurant portraying slides of black and white pictures of famous blues stars like Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and their songs of blues and bluegrass was quite entertaining.  

Now, for the food.  We ordered 
Ribs - Delicious and cooked to perfection.  Will order again.
Chilled Watermelon - Huge cubes of chilled watermelon with herbs and seasoning to make it savoury.  Neat!
Fried Green Tomatoes - I like!  This is so good.  Breaded Green Tomatoes, topped with belly pork and little bits of greens.
Devilled Eggs - Tall and swirly egg yolks don these eggs.  Need more seasoning, I believe.
Mac & Cheese - Needs more seasoning or a sharper cheese mix.  Probably won't order this again unless they change the recipe.
Charred Okra - Delicious!  Such a simple dish with a dash of vinegar and charred okra really works!
Fried Chicken - Pretty good fried chicken; good dipping sauce with a kick.
Biscuits - Nice, warm biscuits with whipped butter and homemade strawberry jam.

Wait service was prompt.  The food comes out whenever it's ready and serves 2-4 guests, especially the entrées.  I see the tables for 2 and they usually run out of space on their table pretty quick.  That's how large the plates are.  The food is meant for sharing.

The front of Yardbird features a very comfortable looking bar, dimly lit with communal tables and plenty of couches to relax and have a cocktail or five. When you come to eat, though, you're ushered into a quite large dining area in the back, just as comfortably decorated. We arrived at 12PM on a Saturday and were seated immediately for brunch. I have a feeling that won't be able to happen once more people learn about this place.

The menu at Yardbird is something between Tapas and Family-Style, offering large, inventive Southern dishes that can feed anywhere between 2-4 people. Our waitress suggested that we order a few and share, rather than get individual plates. So we did! We ordered the Fried Green Tomato ""BLT's"", the Pancakes, the Yardbird Benedict, and finished up with the Buttermilk Biscuits. 

The BLT's were an absolute hit. The tomatoes were perfectly fried, and the house-cured and smoked bacon melted in your mouth.

My husband and I were there for the holiday, and last Friday was our first time going to the restaurant. We found the place from my favorite TV show ""Hell's Kitchen"", and thought we should give it a try.
It started with our crappy Uber ride from the airport, then we went straight to Yardbird for dinner. Though our reservation was made for a later time, somehow they were able to accommodate us for an earlier dinner time. We ordered the chicken and waffles for our shared dinner and had the mac & cheese, as well the devil's egg. Which turned out perfect! 
We got sat in Andy's section, he was our server for the evening, and so I made a small conversation with him, and Andy made us feel very welcome and pretty much took care of us until the end. On a later time, I got to meet Tajeh, one of the executive chef working that night. She was quickly visiting her family's table, and I just jokingly stopped her and made a small conversation. 
I must say...This place didn't feel like just your typical restaurant, it seriously felt like you're part of their family. You come, you eat, drink, then they'll feed you some more until you can't eat anymore!
The chefs were amazingly kind, Andy pretty much took care of us, and he even introduced us to the morning/daytime chef. Their food is really beyond my pallets, and I've always loved the southern type of food. 
I am sure they don't get to see the same face every day and make friends with random guests. But in my case, if you know the right place to make friends and dine....It's with those folks who makes and serves your food. Yardbird is just that southern comfort, with the right type of food, great staff, and just superb service.
Thank you, Andy & Tajeh for taking care of us during our visit!!! :)
We will for sure be back to visit you guys, whenever we're in Vegas.

I am known by family and friends as a 'picky' Easter, but I prefer to look at it as dedicated to delicious food and not willing to compromise. Knowing that I am selective where I eat, Yardbird is AMAZING! 
There are plenty of places to eat in Vegas, but this place was so good we ate there twice. They are known for their fried chicken and for good reason, it was juicy and flavorful. The first night we ordered the Deviled Eggs as an appetizer and they were phenomenal. My wife and I ordered the chicken to share along with the four classic biscuits, and green beans. It was all very good. The meal was excellent other than the green beans and they were okay. 
The second night we ordered the fried chicken with an extra chicken breast because I was extra hungry. We ordered the classic biscuits again because they are amazing. Instead of the green beans we ordered roasted cauliflower and it was really good. We also ordered the mango salad and added grilled shrimp which was superb. Service both nights were excellent. 
Overall it was two PHENOMENAL meals that I would recommend to anyone. I can't wait to go back to Vegas to eat at Yardbird again!!",Pp-K0ZLjVEDmVkf5CPuM-A,3,1,5,KgBjGwtlAnZmS7bQqeQSBw

I have wanted to go to the Miami location for awhile and, once I saw there was a Yardbird in Vegas, I knew that was where our Saturday brunch was destined to be. Four of us went here this past weekend and had a reservation. 

We were seated promptly upon arrival at a comfortable table. The decor is homey with southern influence and cool lights made out of mason jars. Our server welcomed us almost immediately and took our drink orders. I had a Bloody Mary, of course, made with Tito's jalapeno-infused vodka. Full Bloody review is on my website (this one got a 97%!). Link is in bio.

For our meal, we had the chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles for the table-- a dish that I have been waiting to try ever since laying my eyes upon Yardbird's menu months ago. It was AMAZING. The chicken is brined for 27 hours, which allows all of the delicious flavors to come together. We also had two orders of the smoked brisket and biscuits. The biscuits were succulent and buttery, while the brisket was tender. We also ordered two Yardbird bennys, which represented a new rendition on the classic benedict. It was served in a cast iron skillet and seemed more like a skillet than a benny, with biscuit crumbles, bacon, and hollandaise all layered in a pie-like situation. Best benny I have ever had and oozing with flavor. 

The ambiance, service, food, and cocktails were truly out of this world. I highly recommend Yardbird.",W8vex7JN9oTZv8Md5HRxWA,0,4,5,8FrzMxB7rVP_pnNWZKJKwQ

5815238,2017-03-05,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"This is an edited review and has been re-rated to reflect my most recent experience at Yardbird, which is much more in line with my original experience here, not the second. 

2-1/2 years ago, my wife and I visited Las Vegas on our anniversary trip and ate at the Yardbird for the first time and it was nothing short of magical. Fast forward 2 years and we returned with a friend and it was 180 degrees from our first time. 

I documented the experience here and received a very courteous reply from ownership imploring me to give them another chance. Last week, I did just that, joining them for their take on Thanksgiving dinner. 

From the start, this was a different feel for me. Not just because it was me, by myself, having lost my wife to cancer a month before, but the feel of Yardbird was different to me. 

I was seated in the front room and greeted by my server Christina. I'm just going to say, I could not have asked for a more attentive, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable person to guide me through my meal. 

I already knew what I wanted, having previewed the Thanksgiving menu in advance, so I wanted little time ordering and then sat back and began enjoying a glass of 10 yr Old Rip Van Winkle. I managed to nurse that single glass through all 3 courses of my meal, enjoying how the flavor altered in pairing with the items in my meal.

My appetizer, butternut squash ravioli with sunflower brittle, was visually enticing. I'm not a fan of brittle, but in this particular combination, it was a perfect bite with the delicate butternut squash ravioli. 

My entree and stuffing came next and after over 18 years of frying turkeys for Thanksgiving and reveling in the moist delicate flavors, this turkey exceeded mine and I'm not ashamed to admit it. The gravy on top, mashed potatoes below and cranberry compote along with the biscuit stuffing made many, many happy bites for my mouth. 

Last, but not least was the bourbon pecan pie with salted caramel ice cream and I now know what to do to pecan pie to make it better; add bourbon. Works for me. 

During the meal, I had the pleasure of speaking with a couple of management members, Scott and Kim, as well as exchange foodie thoughts with a couple at the table next to me, who were enjoying theirs as much as I was mine. 

Timing of the service was ideal, no rush, no lag. Interestingly, I'm pretty sure I saw the waiter from our previous visit and he appeared to be slinging drinks, not waiting tables. Probably a better role for him. 

I was asked back to give Yardbird another try and show what they were capable of and I do not regret doing so. My only regret is that the love of my life wasn't there to enjoy it with me.",eXYSpC8PK82zauadLP7UWA,0,0,5,EcqA2F77BRagrtUFlhYUvA

Sat at the bar and ordered off their lunch menu. Bartenders were really nice and struck up conversation easily. I've been to places where the bartenders will hide on the other side, not the case here. Their menu is printed on card stock and it is cute. I've posted a couple of photos to show you. 

Blackberry Lemonade, made with bourbon, such an amazing balance of bourbon and sweetness- I could literally drink gallons of this. No problem.
Blind Lemon Shandy- refreshing and it's over SHAVED ICE! How cool is that? The drinks are a little expensive, 15$ ish each, but we thought we had to give the unique creations a try. And maybe for Vegas standards, it's not so expensive! 

Rustic kale caeser salad totally hit the spot. Large portion. I left full! My husband got the Mac & Cheese and it was hearty. I was impressed with how homemade it actually tasted. So good.

5822034,2016-07-31,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"I ordered the ""signature"" chicken, watermelon and waffles. 

They had good alcohol options, I added a pear cider. 

Opinion on the chicken: 
I am from the south (SC), and I hate to say it, but the chicken here is the best I've ever had. I don't know how they do it. I am ashamed to say it.

Maybe my memory is just bad and I can't remember how good it was, I haven't lived down south or visited in a few years now.

Waffles: 
I enjoy waffles but have never been a fan of chicken and waffles. I tried them, because they looked pretty good. 
Why were these waffles so good? Now I am going to want this more often and I don't have a local Yardbirds. 

Watermelon:
Didn't try it. Priorities are chicken & waffles. 


Size of meal:
I am not a big eater, so it isn't uncommon for me to order a burger and leave a 5th of it or so. This was way too much food for me. I had 2 quarters of the waffle, and only 3-4 of the chicken pieces and didn't even pick them clean. I felt guilty not eating it all, it was so good. They didn't have a ""half-size"" though, so what can you do. 


Dessert:
Caramel bread pudding - I didn't like it much, but there are many ways to make this and they did it fine. It just wasn't for me. 



Wait staff: 
It was @10pm when I ate there. I had 6 different people check on me & ask how things were. The waiter was very attentive as well. I am not very picky or anything, so I didn't ask for anything except a check eventually. They gave me water without me needing to think of it. 


Noise & atmosphere:
For anyone in their 30-40s like myself, it should be pretty hip / fun. I really liked the pictures they had rotating on the wall of Elvis, Ali, and a few other famous people, I hadn't seen them before and they were just plain cool. 

Everyone who works here seems chill & cool.

The noise is a little too loud for me, but not a deal breaker. I looked at a few other places and that seems more normal I guess. Not excessively loud I would say.",V_15-YlHN1hWyjAljIzy8Q,0,0,5,27G8FZgXXP3pYHqXksSn1g

With our fried chicken we had Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were caramelized and were a big hit at the table.

5837959,2015-02-07,1,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"This new Southern eatery is a nice addition to the Venetian's fine roster of restaurants, especially for Fried Chicken enthusiasts.  Here The Bird: Lewellyn's Fine Fried Chicken (one-half free range chicken) is brined 27 hours, which results in consummate tenderness and moist chicken meat.  There is a slight kick to the skin of the animal, but not to the top-drawer meat inside.  Tabasco Honey is served on the side if one wants an even more spiced up bird.  But it added nothing to the tastiness of the fowl for me, which in fact lived up to all of the hype this Southern Fried Chicken has been receiving as of late.

To enhance my lunch entree I opened with an appetizer that towered over the plate: suitably cold, salty, and trouty-tasting Deviled Eggs with fresh dill, Smoked Trout Roe (""Redneck Caviar""), and a little paprika sprinkled on top.  Deviled Egg was also utilized as a base to adhere the bottom of the hard-boiled egg to the appetizer platter.  

House-Cut Fries came with Buttermilk Dipping Sauce and Bacon Salt, and an order of fresh house-baked Buttermilk Biscuits was rewarded with soft biscuits, Honey Butter, and a sensational tasting dark Strawberry Jam.

Throughout the meal, hard-driving Southern music played while photos of iconic personalities like Elvis, James Brown, and Muhammad Ali were projected on the wall.

Servers were friendly and knowledgeable, but service was sporadic, and chicken, fries, and biscuits arrived at the table individually, in shifts.  I had to ask another busgirl for extra Honey Butter, and a busboy for more water.  

The food was great.  And, overall, this was a nice experience which bears repeating once food preparation becomes better coordinated and initial service kinks have been kneaded out.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,5,4,tCibrxTxnsYFzWHk1tKpAw

This was an interesting choice, but I feel this place is a little over-hyped.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but I was not wow'ed.  

Highlights:

Ham biscuits - this was AMAZING probably the best thing we had
Farmer's Cheese with Watermelon - OMG - 2nd best thing we had
Deviled eggs

Sadly, nothing else really stood out.  I had the fried chicken and it was good fried chicken, solid.  Moist, well prepared, totally adequate.  The Mango salad had potential, the smoked mango was amazing, but it was service with a ""chinese chicken salad"" type dressing that didn't suit at all.  

Unfortunately, I made dinner res without asking if anybody was vegetarian and ended up with two in my party of five.  When I tell you there was bacon everywhere, the butterscotch cake had bacon frosting.  It was also disgusting.  Nobody at the table liked it. 

They did have a nice vegetarian option of a Gnocchi Pot Pie (so carb fest) which was overly salty according to my two diners.  

In terms of dining experience, the service was ... ok ... waiter was a bit awkward, and the worst thing was that this place was HIDEOUSLY loud!  They were trying to create a Southern vibe with the music, I guess and conversation was impossible.

Skillet Cornbread 
- packed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and jalapeño, the fragrant delicate bread just crumbles in your mouth in the best way possible.  top that with the maple butter and it was an amazing appetizer!

Butter Lettuce & Grilled Mango Salad
- sweet grilled mangoes and smoked pecans on a small bed of greens...hmmm it was defintely tasty, but i would recommend saving more space for the hearty stuff on the menu, plus the portion size for this was quite meager in my opinion

Smoked Brisket Biscuit 
- pickled onions, cucumber, tomato jam,  bbq sauce with the MOST TENDER BRISKET EVER!  i would've thought the the brisket would be tougher than the biscuit, but when you bite down on it, the brisket falls clean off along with the biscuit!  AMAZING!!  truly a must-try

Chicken  and Watermelon  Waffles
-  cheddar cheese waffle was perfectly fluffy and was on par with the corn bread
- chicken was PERFECTLY juicy inside with a slight crisp and good flavor on the outside, but what pulled this whole dish together was the bourbon maple syrup!  OMG the bitter/sweet goes so well with this dish - another MUST try dish

LOCATION: Located inside of the Venetian on ""restaurant row"" it's not in the actual mall area but follow the signs in the casino for ""restaurant row"" and you'll see it.

ATMOSPHERE: Definitely felt like a place I would see in the south with very low lighting, mason jar chandeliers and open kitchen.  There's a lounge/bar type area with low couches for happy hour and then there are regular high top tables and booths.  Definitely trendy enough for a birthday dinner or date.

WAIT: We came at 4:45pm (made reservations online although they weren't needed) and there was no wait. I'm sure as the night progresses it gets more crowded.  Most people were at the bar/lounge area.

FOOD: We just got the fried chicken by itself which is the same portion as the chicken waffle but no waffle.  It comes with 4 pieces (breast, thigh, wing and drumstick) so a mix of dark and white meat.  The meat itself is very tasty and tender, juicy and not dry.  The coating isn't super crumbly and was more on the soft/smooth side.  It didn't quite have the crunch I was looking for but the flavor was fantastic.  That definitely saved it.  It's more like a fish and chips coating where it's one solid piece around the meat instead of like at Popeyes where it's very crunchy and crumbly.

Overall, a great place for some fried chicken.  It is a little on the pricier side and I wish we had tried some of their other dishes!",PB3OEIzQGx_p6VdpzX3Feg,2,1,4,npuM_A4UUZ5cXQGr1wRr_g
5894183,2015-02-08,2,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbird is Vegas-style southern. It's high-priced fancy fare -- but also greezy, greezy comfort food. The price point sits a little higher than it should, but if those winnings are burning a hole in your pocket, it's definitely worth a try.

Let me start by saying the Fine Fried Chicken is a pinnacle of fried chicken. The skin crisp and light, but potent with spices; the meat was tender throughout, even the breast (we surmise it's been soaked in buttermilk) -- BUT, for $27 for 1/2 bird, the concept seems underdeveloped. The only accompaniment was a dilute Tabasco/honey mixture, but that seemed like an afterthought.

If you do get the chicken, a side of biscuits is a must. The biscuits are heaven, as flaky buttery biscuits with honey butter are wont to be.

The deep fried green tomato BLT also had good and bad elements. The green tomato was wonderful -- thick, umami, and delicately battered. Unfortunately, the huge slab of pimento cheese unbalanced the dish quite a bit and made it very heavy.

Bloody marys are great! Served in a bell jar -- spicy, salty, with a slice of bacon (of course).",ZkHEO2ChtXA2KWJoi_xKbQ,4,1,3,8M7CzAs5xptTdxoHv5fMfw
5897244,2018-06-28,0,faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"Yardbirds, located in the Venetian Resort is touted for their farm fresh ingredients and classic Southern cooking. We were looking forward to sampling a few of their dishes but some of these dishes fell a little short of our expectations. 

First of all our waiter was great! Very knowledgeable and gave detailed explanations describing all food and drink options. 

Yardbirds specializes in Bourbon drinks and of course they have a full bar with cocktails, beer and wine. My husband enjoyed a Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade that was delicious and served in a mason jar, I enjoyed a traditional Manhattan with cherries that were soaked in bourbon! Delicious! 

On to the food.. a little disappointing but not terrible! We even noticed that the couple next to us sent back their Liver Pate, and after talking with them found out that they were also dissatisfied with their Short Ribs, loved the Cauliflower mashed potatoes, and their Fried Chicken with Waffles  (which is a signature dish) was good but thought the waffles were disappointing. So they weren't happy campers! 

For our dinner we ordered four small plates. Deviled Eggs with dill, chives and smoked trout roe which my husband enjoyed but I thought were a little dry. We then had their Preacher's Ham biscuits with Vermont sharp cheddar cheese that were good. Next we had Black Angus Burnt Ends with blue cheese fondue, (which lacked a blue cheese flavor) tater tots and pickled chilies which my husband enjoyed but I thought the whole dish was lacking flavor. Lastly we shared an Iceberg Wedge with smoked bacon, charred corn, heirloom tomatoes and avocado with a buttermilk dressing. Loved everything except for the dressing which wasn't very flavorful or distinctive which made the whole salad blah! 

So this wasn't the best first impression and experience at this restaurant but definitely want to come back and sample their namesake Southern Fried Chicken.

We started off with the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the BBQ Pork Belly.  Well, we both agreed that the pork belly in both dishes was tough and flavorless.  It wasn't even chewy or crispy.  It may have been baked yesterday and reheated.  It was like leather.  No bueno.

Next we had the Shrimp N' Grits and the Fried Catfish (also came with Grits).  The shrimp was pretty good.  The catfish, oh boy.  They give you 3 huge pieces, but don't be deceived.  There was so much crunchy coating on the catfish it was ridiculous.  I wound up peeling it all off just to get the flavor of the fish.  That was a mistake.  Whatever they used as the seasoning/marinade was so sour, but not unbearable.  Needless to say, I ate the fish and left the coating to the side.  Now for the grits.  The texture was perfect, but it had no flavor and needed salt.

We didn't even bother with dessert since I was so disappointed.

Look, I would go back and try it again since the reviews are so good.  It could have been an off night for the chef (which happens).

Our server was so friendly and attentive.  We weren't lacking for anything thing and I always appreciate that.  The atmosphere is great too.  We were very comfortable and weren't rushed out.

Overall, it was a nice experience even though the food I chose could have been better.  But again, could just have been my choices were poor.

Came here with a group of 12 while staying in the Venetian for bachelor party recovery brunch. We initially were turned away because we tried getting in without a reservation, but managed to get a reservation in the private room the next day. We sat in a side room with a giant mirror that doubled as a television, which was awesome. Most of my buddies were LSU fans, so we were able to catch some of the SEC games as we ate. Despite recovering from some previous night debauchery, we still went for the bacon Buffalo Trace old-fashioneds, as well as copious amounts of beer. C'mon, it's Vegas.

Some of the favorite dishes among the group:
- Deviled eggs with salmon roe: Not much we can say except how much filling was piled up, and as always, the salmon roe created the right amount of saltiness
- Fried green tomatoes with pork belly: Crunchy fried green tomatoes with pork belly just made for a really great combination, and the contrasts in texture really worked well 
- Biscuits and gravy with fried chicken (special): Super rich and meaty, with bits of pork sausage in the gravy, and the biscuit really held up throughout the meal without getting too soggy. Oh yeah, and there was bacon in it too. Whew.
- Fried chicken and waffles: Their classic dish, executed perfectly, and easily the favorite of the group. Waffle was crispy and chewy at the same time, and the fried chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy at the same time.

Service was very accommodating throughout the meal, and drinks were refilled at an incredibly efficient pace. Prices were reasonable, even at the sheer amount of food and drinks we ordered for 12 hungry dudes. 

Definitely worth a visit if you're staying nearby or in the Venetian itself. Yardbird continues to be a crowdpleaser, and there ain't many who would say no to some good fried chicken.",eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw,40,40,5,20uaqvM0FUCzOxJnWD21tA

We went for brunch last Saturday.  The first warning sign was when the food arrived ~5 minutes after we ordered it, before our drinks were made and before I had a chance to unroll my napkin.

My best guess is that the kitchen had batch cooked certain items to handle the weekend crowds.  Unfortunately, this affected the quality of the food.  The waffles from my chicken and waffles were room temperature at best and tasted bland.  The fried chicken was tasty, but nothing extraordinary.  My husband's biscuits and gravy was a very small serving of tasty (but not outstanding) food.

Given the very high price-tag associated with Yardbird (~$90 for two breakfast dishes and two drinks), I expected better.",PYg9q8jKd2JNz1wTBcUjAQ,0,0,3,5egEa6YlQsmo2zMTW-ShvQ

Here is what was ordered in the following:
1. Deviled eggs- beautiful presentations with dill, chives, and smoked salmon roe. light and delicious.
2. Skillet Cornbread - amazing! Cheese, jalapeño, and bacon all mixed in with honey maple butter!
3. CRUNCHY YARDBIRD SANWHICH! (that's how it is spelled on their menu) - one of the best on my list...it was crispy and light like a salad!
4. Blackberry bourbon lemonade - soo good I could drink 2 (and I'm a small girl) 
5. Peach cobbler- there's a marzipan crumble! peaches were cooked perfectly, not overly sweet which is the way I like, beautiful presentation with vanilla ice cream and a cinnamon twist across the board, literally.

The 10 adults that were here were all very happy we chose Yardbird. Most of us either ordered the chicken n waffles or the 1/2 chicken. It was all pretty good, just not the best fried chicken I've had. Chicken was very tasty and tender, for me it was missing the crispy skin I like to pick off. What was really good were the appetizers we ordered...Fried green tomatoes BLT(thick slices of pork belly on top!), bacon, maple glazed bacon donuts, and Mac n cheese were totally awesome! I'd go back for just those. Dessert was pretty good, we had the fried oreos and peach cobbler. Another big reason my wife and I liked Yardbird was the service we had from our waiter Adrian. He was super cool and really nice to our 2 young children. He was on point with everything. He explained thoroughly the menu to my parents who are a little older and didn't really understand southern food/menu items, he came around a lot through our meal and just seemed to enjoy his job. Thanks Adrian!The other 3 waiters were just ok, felt like they were trying to rush us out. The 1 female waitress acted surprised when we asked if we can box the leftovers. For reals?

I had more people join my party than my original reservation and the hostess was very accommodating.
I had a double whiskey sour while I waited for my table and it was exactly what I needed after a long day at work. The table was ready pretty quickly for a group of 7 people. 

My staple here is usually the fried chicken with Mac & cheese and it didn't disappoint. It was crispy, tender on the inside, a little spicy and full of flavor. It was just as good as I remember from Miami, if not better! The other people in my group hadn't tried the fried chicken before and were blown away by it.

On to the dinner. Wow. Haven't had a delicious meal like that in a while.  Started with the fried green tomato 'BLT', which was great.

I honestly thing our server made our dining experience as great as it was. Not only was he always checking in on us, but he was so nice, funny, and super helpful in guiding us through the menu giving some great recommendations. 

We started with the fried green tomato BLT which we couldn't get enough of. It had so much flavor and texture; three fried green tomatoes topped with some sort of amazing sauce/aioli and a nice thick slice of smoked bacon. It was amazing! Once the BLTs were gone, they brought out our cornbread skillet. May have been some of the best cornbread I have ever had. It was so moist and cake that you almost expect it to be the sweet cake cornbread, but nope, it was how cornbread should taste but wasn't dry like most cornbread becomes when prepared this way. I loved every bit of it! We ended the most amazing dining experience with the fried chicken, waffle, and watermelon. The fried chicken is fried in lard, not oil so it is about as legit and tasty as it can get. I cannot even begin to explain the watermelon, you just HAVE to try it! The cheddar waffle was amazing!!! The meal is served with house made Louisiana hot sauce, bourbon syrup (basically straight bourbon), and our server recommended adding honey as well and I'm sure glad he did. all the sauces were so great and added unique flavor and twists to the chicken and waffle but the honey was definitely the real MVP.

I had made a reservation online for 6 people at 9pm on a Friday. A few hours before the reservation, I called to see if I could increase the party size to 8 and the hostess was able to accommodate my request.

Our flight landed ~8pm and by the time we got luggage (of course, ONE person had to check something in), got our Uber, and arrived at the Venetian, it was already 8:45pm. There was a long (but relatively quick) line at the hotel check-in and as soon as I checked into my room, I headed to Yardbird while the rest of my party of 8 dropped off their bags in their rooms.

We were organized and already knew exactly what we wanted to order. I walked into Yardbird at 9pm and let the hostess know that although the rest of my party wasn't there yet, they would be shortly and I was ready to order. She made a note in the system that we had to be out by 10pm (had to get ready and get to the club before guestlist closes) and led me to the high-top for 8. 

My server came within a couple of minutes and assured me that we'd be able to get out within an hour. I placed my order with him and he filled our waters. Over the next 10 minutes, the rest of my group trickled in. Almost immediately after the 8th person was seated, food started coming out. And all of the entrees and appetizers (which we shared family style) were on the table within 5 minutes.

We were hungry and dug right in. Everything we ordered was shareable and tasty. Of course, the fried chicken was the star of the show and even the breast meat was incredibly tender. We ordered half of a fried chicken and another order of chicken & waffles, which ended up totaling 8 pieces of fried chicken, perfect for the 8 of us. The hot sauce had a nice kick to it.

The roasted chicken was also fabulous. Super juicy and full of flavor. Yum! Pork ribs were good as were the Shrimp 'N Grits. In total, we ordered 5 entrees.

The appetizers/sides we shared were Fried Okra, Brussel Sprouts, Classic Biscuits. All were excellent. It was now around 9:40pm and the staff quickly cleared the table to get us ready for dessert.

New plates and spoons were handed out and Peach Cobbler and Mississippi Mud Flower Pot were served. I love the peach cobbler here and although it's $25, it was big enough for our entire group to share.

The total including tax and tip was $34 per person for this incredible feast. Everyone was extremely satisfied with the quality of food and I can't thank Yardbird enough for doing everything to get us in and out quickly without ever making us feel rushed.

Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles- we were planning on ordering some sort of fried chicken entree and the shrimp and grits, but our server informed us that this chicken and waffles dish was their most popular and that it'd be enough for two people. It was $36 for a plate of 4 pieces of fried chicken, watermelon, waffles, hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. My favorite thing about this dish was the bourbon maple syrup. Drenching my soggy waffles in this made it taste a little better. I'm glad it came with hot sauce for dipping too, because the fried chicken definitely needed it since it wasn't that flavorful. I honestly prefer Popeyes chicken over the fried chicken here.

Mac n cheese- it was okay. We were expecting amazingness since the menu says that this is made with ""five artisanal cheeses"". It wasn't that saucy or cheesy at all.

Deviled eggs- soooo good. I've only ever had deviled eggs homemade at potlucks and never thought such a simple dish could taste this amazing. They make it with dill, chive and smoked trout roe here. I'm going to have to try to replicate this dish. Love.

Dinner Experience:
Service - Fantastic. We ate early so it wasn't busy at all. Our waiter was friendly, we were seated quickly and our food came out really fast. The one small bummer here was that we weren't done with our appetizer when our food came out.  BLT appetizer was outstanding. We had the friend chicken and mac n cheese for dinner and it was so delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the mac and cheese was so well done. 

Brunch: I think I loved our brunch even more than dinner. I got the ham biscuits and the potato hash. Let me tell you, that potato hash is made of sunshine and dreams - it's that good. I don't know how they make hashbrowns creamy and crispy all at once, but they do and it's a beautiful marriage. I also have to give a special shout out for their coffee. Vegas is filled with really crappy and expensive coffee. This was some of the most rich, full bodied coffee I've had in that town. I would have taken an entire thermos if they let me.

We started off with some chicken and ham biscuits that were great! They came with their house pickles, okra and pickled red onions. So good! They actually had to make new biscuits and because of the possible wait they brought us some cornbread with butter on top. Just delectable. 

If you don't get the fried chicken when you are hear you are making a mistake! Because they pressure fry the chicken it was so crispy but the moisture was off the charts! I can not push hard enough that the fried chicken is the way to go!

Had the warm farmer cheese and watermelon, biscuits and green tomato blt for appetizers and all was awesome. 

Split the chicken and waffles w the wife and was more than enough food but of course we also had to order the Mac and cheese and ranch cucumber salad. Everything was spot on.

I will say be prepared for a big bill.. it's expensive but well worth it.",RNb7C8V_4r3d8JYdzLoGCQ,1,0,5,GDZbfLzLcGQ44jKNztzn2Q

I have found my new FAVORITE Fried Chicken & Waffles (Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles)! Everything about the dish was satisfied all of my taste buds. The Fried Chicken was so delicious, juicy & seasoned perfectly so you don't even need any sauces or gravy. The skin was crisp & of course the best part! The Watermelon is spiced & was a great addition to the dish. The Waffles were great especially because they Vermont Sharp Cheddar Cheese, my only complaint would be was that it was a little cold. The portion was huge for me & it is $36, but COMPLETELY worth it!

I also had the Caramel Coffee Creme Brulee & the Peanut Butter Ice Cream Pie. The Caramel Coffee Creme Brulee was great, it wasn't too sweet & the flavors meshed well as expected. The Peanut Butter Ice Cream Pie is to DIE FOR!! Our server actually recommended the dessert & I'm so glad I got it because it is literally the BEST dessert I've ever had in my life! The Peanut Butter Ice Cream is made in-house & it has an Oreo Crust, pretty much all that is needed to say. 

The staff is wonderful, very friendly & exemplary of true Southern hospitality. The decor is rustic & has a very homey vibe, definitely a restaurant that makes you feel welcomed & feeling at home. 

This restaurant has become my go-to stop every time I'm in Vegas & look forward to coming back to try the House made Biscuits & all the other menu items!",PopUe7mGQEGx3tZOkhZ47g,5,2,5,jjWtPVgl0ouGjrjydPWMEA

The service was horrid, and no it was not busy. Could we get some water??? geez. Forgotten drink order without an apology. The food came out one item at a time .... Ten minutes apart ... Cold... Always the best part - server kept disappearing, so you couldn't flag her down.
I don't like to be rushed, I respect a meticulous kitchen, I like freshly cooked food (duh), but this was a demonstration of a poor run show all around.

From the moment I entered with warm smiles at the host stand to the warm welcoming spiel from our server Christian gave to us Till the exiting and the goodnights of once again the hostess team. 

Started off with the special of the day. Which was ribs and fried chicken. then we had a couple of sides to compliment that. The fried pickles were my FAVE! I had a sparkling wine to compliment the Ribs and Fried pickles as suggested by our server as my boyfriend had blackberry bourbon lemonade. Each quenched out thirsts. 

I enjoyed that after each item was brought to our table*well presented by the food runner* and we FINISHED the dish the server came back and asked how did we enjoy it. Although one item was not to our satisfaction(mac n cheese) I know it was just a work in progress because I know how their mac n cheese tastes(AMAZING), coming from Miami and going to the location there. Upon telling Christian about this slight problem less than 2 mins passed and the General manager Gregg came by to apologize. Super sincere and real he was about the situation made me feel that much better that they are always on top of things and wont let something as small as my mac n cheese pass them by!

I will be returning and as a local here in Las Vegas I will be there often! might I add the restaurant its self was spectacular very eye catching! 

THANK YOU YARDBIRD TEAM FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE A WONDERFUL DINNER WITH MY BOYFRIEND.",mnxZbLKN-nWj6xQP122pGw,0,0,5,Im9uEmSyPZWsvLH1iWvySw

You gotta go for their fried green tomatoes, which have pork belly and a sweet jam on top. Such a unique take and definitely delicious. I also got the biscuits with fried chicken and sweet jam. The combo was definitely good - with mouth-watering, non-greasy fried chicken and great texture on the biscuits - but it didn't blow me out of the water. (I could hear the waiter in his voice edging me toward the brisket instead. Maybe next time!)

They have a great selection of local beers and a fancy cocktail menu. I went for their Old Fashioned, which came with a sphere ice cube. 

Definitely worth stopping in if you're looking for some upscale Southern food. I loved the vibe! It can definitely get crowded for dinner and late night.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,4,2,4,JZFSNDEYdNT_TIcNKUpZBQ

Don't get me wrong, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience here but it's tough to reproduce that same unique/homey vibe in a Vegas hotel. The decor is very similar but it's much bigger.  The bartender and server were friendly but the experience wasn't quite as ""personal"" as my experience at the original Miami location.  The food though was still fantastic, almost as fantastic.  I'm a gigantic fan of the fried green tomato appetizer...it's become one of my favorite things ever.  You can't go wrong with the fried chicken...definitely some of the best you will ever have.  I favor the chicken on the biscuits as the portion works great and the flavor is awesome.  Tried the okra this time and it was delicious.  I didn't think okra could taste that good.  If you are in Vegas and haven't been to Yardbird yet, I highly recommend it.",Q-wZgSosVo4x4arPKHtKeQ,0,0,4,vNbQiXdc7OAnFbb2zSokoQ
