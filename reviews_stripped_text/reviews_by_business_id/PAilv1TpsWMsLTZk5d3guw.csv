Apparently the place has won awards for it's Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable - nothing spectacular. 

Food was decent, service was so-so, and I think everything was a tad overpriced.

I mean if you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a ""mom and pop"" shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is actually a chain too...",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,1,0,3,KqU94jAVjAJfHfRWVl1uOg

The restaurant was very hot so I don't think a/c was working or it was not turned on.  The workers were sweating.  One kept opening the large refrigerator to fan herself.  The time to receive my meal took way too long.  Looked like they may have been short staffed.  What really blew my mind though was the fact that when I finished my meal I needed to use the restroom & to wash my hands from having a messy sandwich.  I was told that this location does not offer restrooms & that I would have to walk over to KFC to use their restroom.  I said What?!!!!  I am a paying customer & just ate in your restaurant & you cannot offer a restroom?  The worker said no & that's the way it is.  I asked for the manager & was told the same thing.  They do not have restrooms for customers.  I have never heard of such a thing!  I watched as another customer had to walk over to KFC to use their restroom after placing their order.  I was appalled!  There is absolutely no excuse not to offer restroom facilities to paying customers at the very least to wash hands since you are eating a meal there!  I could understand a little if restroom was out of order for a particular reason, but that was not the case.  Needless to say, I will not be back to this location as they obviously do not value their customers.  Bit of advice, if you do visit here, make sure you go to restroom somewhere else beforehand & bring some sanitary hand wipes with you as you will not be able to wash your hands unless you walk over to the KFC which a customer should not have to do.",q6jteRunPErj7P-JDhVz4A,0,0,1,SiEui_rpJ9keTjCXFFqcCQ

I was having a Bobbie; she wanted me to pick up Turkey and Provolone, lettuce - no onions, no tomato, no oil and vinegar, no salt and pepper. She's almost a complete vegetarian; never eats red meat.

When we opened the sandwiches at home, mine was correct. Hers was labeled as an Italian sandwich on the receipt (with provolone specified). It was chock full of nothing but red meat... including pepperoni, ham, and one other. She was ticked off and decided to head over to exchange or return the sandwich for refund.

The manager, on the register, was the same person who took my order. She insisted that's what I ordered. My girlfriend's response... ""I didn't sent some flunky to pick up a sandwich, he knows me more than 10 years. He knows I don't eat red meat and would never order it for me. A refund ensued.

The manager made a parting dig. ""You got your refund, you should be happy.""

Not really... a simple sandwich order had been made. Deferring lunch at that point was not a 'happy moment'.

Excuse me??? Um, shouldn't this be an everyday thing if your establishment offers it? 
I guess he was fairly OK in attitude but seemed inconvenienced / stand-offish the whole time. 
I'm all for some companies not wanting to deliver but if you advertise it, employees should be a little more accepting of the fact they're going to have to do it. 
Furthermore if its a $50 minimum, shouldn't you mention that in your ad? I would figure you'd be fielding alot of unnecessary phone calls with such a vague listing. I don't know if it's just me but I believe there's alot of miscommunication and maybe some retraining that needs to be done at this establishment.

I came to this location for the first time today and ordered four sandwiches. Two of the four came out right.

My sister is boring and she likes her sandwiches with almost nothing on them. I am the opposite. I like my sandwiches Primanti's-style--filled to the brim and only edible if you kind of tilt your head sideways and gnaw at them. So, you can imagine my sadness when I got home and my sandwich turned out to be the vegetarian version of my sister's (turkey, cheese, lettuce.) It was a mere ghost of what a sandwich should be. I even asked for pickles and of course, there were no pickles. :(

The other issue is that I asked for wheat on my sister's sandwich. Maybe there was a communication problem, since the person who took my order handed it off to someone else.

On the plus side, my sandwich was good (at least the ""meat"" was correct!) and the employees could not have been nicer. Capriotti's sandwiches are so good that I'll keep coming back despite service issues (until I find a replacement.)",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,1,0,2,BFbQYxivv_0NZTce66uJhw

Luckily, there wasn't anyone in line after me and the guy taking orders was super patient.  I asked about their Cole Turkey, which had russian dressing and coleslaw on it, but no one that worked there ever had it, so I took that as an answer of not to order it, haha!

So I ordered:
*Homemade Turkey
comes w/ provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, seasonings.  I had all that and included pickles, mayo and mustard.

The turkey had wonderful flavor.  However, I didn't like how dense the bread was.  I actually tore off a lot of the bread as there was just too much.

*Hot Chicken Cheesesteak

But my first bite into the Capastrami was heaven. I broke up with Cran-Slam Club and I  began my new love affairwith Capastrami. Warm pastrami with tangy coleslaw.. Sigh. I will never forget you Capastrami!!!!",SiC0D4xwdaSSE-BPobASog,2,2,5,uCOP7iv8brSZzlULA8KQ7w

The cranberry, mayo, stuffing and shredded turkey are just to DIE for.  If you haven't had the Bobbie, you haven't lived.  I remember first having a Bobbie in 2000, so I've been living for 11 years now. :)

The employees here are very friendly, the store is always clean and has the typical Capriotti's decor. The food comes rather quickly and for this location, I've seen it very busy, but always had a place to sit.

I like the fact that this Capriotti's is nestled into the shopping center where there are a lot of other food choices, including: Yogi's Teriaki, Long John Silvers, KFC, Taco Bell and Robertos.
