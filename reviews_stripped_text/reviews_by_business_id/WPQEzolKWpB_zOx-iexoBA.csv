I normally get the sweet & sour pork lunch special. Good size portion of pork(sauce on the side), nice helping of egg fried rice and a veggie egg roll. $4.95

Today i decided to go with a side of potstickers(missed breakfast). 6 pieces with a nice dipping sauce, kind of like a spicy teriyaki, pretty good i must say.  $3.95

Im a big fan of chinese take out and i think this place does great, especially with where they are located, (twain and murderland parkway) and will continue to order from here.

I would say this place is a solid 3 1/2 star, but not a 4.",ZlDBSzKymLIDJ0YTr6kIeA,2,0,3,CWDDlUHpcOTienkfVbVIgw
415141,2011-01-28,0,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"I went to this place after searching for egg foo young in my area. Since it is really close by and Sherry M. says the egg foo young is really good I had to try it out. Not in the greatest of neighborhoods but sometimes that's where you find really good food. I did like the fact that it said ""New York Style Chinese Food"" on the menu. None of the lunch specials looked that great so I ordered a small order of each: egg drop soup, bbq pork foo young, and garlic chicken.
-Egg drop soup was light and flavorful. Not too thick like a lot egg drop soups. Also no corn. Light, clear broth with long strands of egg.
-Pork egg foo  young could have been much better. The pork was way overcooked, to the point of being really tough and hard to chew. Should have perhaps tried chicken. 2 nice-sized patties for a small portion. Didn't like the gravy too much. My family is from New York, and I remember as child, just moving to Vegas and had the best egg foo young from Chinese restaurants that no longer exist. I remember the gravy being like gravy..very smooth and rich and patties nice and fat and full of goodies like bean sprouts. Very hard to find that richness so far from any restaurants I've tried, so will continue my quest. Anyway, I digress. The gravy at DB is more like a glaze. And it should have been served on the side for a take out order. Some of the gravy dripped out of the box. The patty was good, but the dried pork ruined it.
-Garlic chicken wasn't what I expected. Lots of large chunks of vegetables: bell pepper, onion, broccoli, celery, carrot, zucchini. There were also red pepper flakes and a sweetness to the sauce. I wasn't expecting such a large amount of veggies with garlic chicken. They were good, nice and crisp, but I picked out the celery, which I don't really care for. They were just very LARGE. Couldn't really taste any garlic.

After eating this meal there was an overwhelming saltiness in my mouth. Don't know if it's from the soy sauce or from the meal itself. I might give this place another shot, have to look over menu again to see if it will be worth it.",1JNqxJr8cDb689up53NGig,1,0,2,aWDokrpQ1sttxuZjqmn2YA

827436,2013-02-03,0,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"It was one of those moments most of us have; the immediate need for Chinese food.  And since my stays in Vegas usually find me staying off-Strip at one of the Marriott properties on Paradise Road, fulfilling that need would take me to D & B Chinese on Vegas`s eastside.

I came away pleasantly satisfied, my need met.

The restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip center off of Twain.  But what was lacking in ambiance was more than made up for with quality, quantity and affordability.  D & B`s menu strikes the usual chords and then some.  Most of the items come in regular and small sizes with the latter fitting anyone`s budget.

My go to dish is Pork Egg Fou Young and when I saw it on the menu it was a lock I'd make that my order.   But  it is risk/reward proposition, especially west of the Missippi where many times I end up getting the scrambled egg Migas version of the dish instead of the omelet style patties and gravy style I grew up with.

It was some of the best I've ever had.  3 piping hot patties with a slightly tangy tasting sauce.  NICE!  I added some Won Ton soup which was a pleasant surprise with a bountiful amount of juliened vegetables complementing  the dumplings and broth.

Good food, good price.  D & B Chinese will feed your need!",_qxLCOG3H1tnY-w8RyafSg,1,0,3,g-L1w5nGWbeJvcNoCIyhew

1939445,2010-04-28,0,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"After my most recent delivery dining experience of D&B, I'm afraid I had to deduct one star.  We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and they only hit the target 50% of the time.

Appetizers:  Fried Wonton was good, but their Fried Shrimp was just plain BAD (mushy, too much coating, and we couldn't even taste the shrimp).

Entrees:  Kung Pao Chicken was okay, but the peanuts had an odd flavor (tasted dirty and stale, no fresh-roasted sweetness), and they were a little skimpy with the chicken.  BBQ Pork Chow Mein was good, but not mind-blowing.

Delivery was very fast, as always! I will order from them again, but will stick to the Egg Foo Young, which is super yummy happy good.",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,3,0,3,NhgfQWzxArirhAr2xYcy7Q
2274954,2011-06-19,0,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"I would not consider D&B to be the best Chinese food I had...

My order was the combination lunch special with two items. Naturally I had the pork fried rice, chicken with broccoli, and sweet & sour chicken. The chicken with broccoli was actually decent and I liked the sauce they used for it. As for the other items they were uninspiring and I've had much better at local restaurants even.

Other than that my first impression was really bad on D&B so I probably won't be coming back anytime soon.",4suJsf9Q2uruOwKlnBixow,1,0,2,q_70GjrfGofd1H7ROlbkKg
2872175,2015-11-04,0,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"I give this place 2 stars for the amount of food they give you. I got a two choice combination with fried rice, orange chicken and spicy chicken. 

The food was OKAY but if you're hungry and want something cheap this is the place to go. They filled the whole to go container with everything I ordered. It also came with egg drop soup which was good. Like I said it's not a fine dining place and the location is kinda sketchy but the amount of food they give you will blow your socks off and it was only $5.45.

3275036,2013-05-22,1,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"Delicious & Best Chinese Food...not an apt name.

Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's also not very good either. The Chicken Chow Mein tastes absolutely delicious though, which happens to come with all of the Combinations and All-Day Specials...which are a good deal at $4.95 and $6.95 respectively.

The items are rather hit and miss on the menu. I enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Chicken, but everything else has proved to be rather disappointing. I was very disappointed to find that the Honey Garlic Chicken is essentially the same thing as Sweet and Sour Chicken, only with a nastier sauce. 

As mentioned before, the Chicken Chow Mein is fantastic, but the Chicken Fried Rice is pretty horrendous. The two times I've had it, it was relatively tasteless and there were pieces of uncooked rice in the mix. The meals also come with an unremarkable Egg-Drop soup...neither good nor bad.

Also, they REALLY skimp on the meat to vegetable ratio. I order my food without vegetables at this place, and the guy behind the counter always cheekily asks,""So, you want Chicken Chow Mein and a little bit of meat."" That's already sort of what I was expecting, but I thought it was a bit goofy that he would just come out and say it.

Honestly, this place is worthy of skipping. The only reason I ever tried this joint is because I did my laundry at Launderland three doors down. Now that ithe laundromat is out of business, it's likely I'll never return to D&B.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,1,0,2,RcPgKVD3f4N4Nf3IjSQh2Q

I wanted to order a vegetarian dish but neither the young or old women in the restaurant could speak a lick of English when I asked questions about the ingredients.  Needless to say, I turned around and left empty handed.

I'm all for immigrants wanting to make a better life for themselves in America but when they make no effort to learn the English language they have no business being in business!",ljocJOAXdKQPLWVtzov5dw,0,0,1,ifJezLUj7lGoZhrc1p8Y9w

5611196,2015-05-31,0,WPQEzolKWpB_zOx-iexoBA,"My family and I tried this place on a whim. We were staying with a friend and walking around while waiting for laundry to be done. The place was empty and the menu didn't have a couple items that we usually get for the kids (plain chicken wings and such). But we decided to try it out for the sake of having tried it. 

The following is what we ordered:
I ordered the Combo Platter and everything is delicious. The egg rolls, cheese rangoon, shrimp, paper wrapped chicken (wrapped in foil actually), pot stickers and fried wonton all were crispy and delicious. I could very well be because we stayed. I can imagine how soggy it could be, had it been delivery/takeout.

Sweet and Sour Chicken
The chicken wasn't drenched in the sauce. I loved that I had the option to drizzle the sauce to not compromise the crunch. The sauce was good. Thick, but not to thick. 

General Tso 
The chicken was great! Nice and big and not too bready

Both dishes came with fried rice that I found a great fried rice. Nothing was raw or uncooked. There was the perfect amount of seasoning and I found no need to alter the dishes at all with duck or soy sauces.",gkG_80oBZmOH2Pus6x16pw,0,0,4,PVJHk3db_dA4TVGWVa3GMA
