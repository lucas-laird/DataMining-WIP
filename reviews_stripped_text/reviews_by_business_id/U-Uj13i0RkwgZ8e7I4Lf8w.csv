Once you get the tenders though, completely different story, absolutely awesome! Crispy, homemade breading, fried to perfection. You don't find chicken tenders like these anywhere anymore.

I will admit, you have to laugh at yourself a little bit going into the Monte Carlo, past 5 high end restaurants and the buffet, but totally worth it.",hizYmVlA-cTtzPQk1IR1xw,0,0,5,TkKor7A5Ch4RNwTn5gCUMQ
663071,2015-04-07,0,U-Uj13i0RkwgZ8e7I4Lf8w,"The chicken tenders were good don't get me wrong but I wouldn't say that they were amazing. Let me break it down:

Pros:
-Chicken is freshly breaded and fried
-Hot and crisp chicken tenders
-Moist, juicy meat, not dry at all
-Friendly workers :)

Cons:
-A little pricy (3 pieces + fries is $7.95, 4 pieces is $8.95, and 5 pieces is $9.95)
-Fries weren't that well seasoned but were still crispy
-Location: Since it's in a food court deep inside of the Monte Carlo, the smoke smell is thick and might bother some while they're eating (but I mean you're in Vegas so...)

Overall, these chicken tenders are above average in taste and are sure to satisfy any cravings. I would return if I were craving chicken tenders. Up to par and better than some restaurants. Don't expect the fries to be that great though. The Original Chicken Tender is a top choice in the Monte Carlo food court.",3Tct85pCVhJtWrqEeTtHTA,1,0,3,cQgqiAHHs9D5Ign2SifFgA

The breading on the chicken tenders is tasty, a little bit sweet. But it's not as crunchy as I would like. The chicken though is super moist and tender. It also comes with a huge basket of fries, the type made from freshly cut potatoes with the skin still on. Their special sauce (dare I say?) reminds me of Raising Canes' sauce: nice and peppery.

Overall, this is a solid place to turn to at the food court when you're looking for freshly fried chicken tenders. They also sell Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs and beer.",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,3,1,3,Ou9kn7yDK0yH1u1GbVlayQ

I love how they don't put too much batter on the chicken! It's not hard and crunchy unlike most chicken strips I've tried, it's perfect lol. It's like really moist when u bite into it and the strips are pretty big. Also I tried the bacon cheddar fries they're actually the best I've had lol.

Means they put the sauerkraut on them you have to put the mustard on top if you want it. Only alternative is for them to give you the kraut on the side.

Really.... Is this a legit hot dog stand?",fy200TPfWyzFwpERwP0OCA,0,0,1,PSLWQ3vtI1_M8vcXJvm-DA
1979784,2015-04-23,1,U-Uj13i0RkwgZ8e7I4Lf8w,Eating in a casino can get expensive if you eat in the signature spots the entire time so places like Original Chicken Tender comes in handy for that little snack. The snack in particular are the two Nathan's Famous hot dogs that you can get when you don't want to pay $24 for the standard buffet. I got them for $6 and they came with a cup of fries. You'll have to prepare the condiments yourself from packets but it's still better than overpaying for the casino restaurants.,Y6XH1iNsuuGAcO5nODI6rg,2,1,4,r_0N9Diu2pGONh1De32KfQ

Grabbed a quick bite to eat before The Blue Man Group. Located inside the Monte Carlo food court. I've had their chicken tenders before and liked them a lot. I had to have them again. 

I had  3 PIECE CHICKEN TENDERS with FRIES $7.00 and original sauce on the side. Chicken tenders were perfect in my book. Crunchy coating and meat was moist and tender. It taste even better dipped in their house-made original sauce. The fries were also perfect. It taste like it's double fried because it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

El Hubby had their PHILLY SANDWICH $9. It had thinly sliced beef, mushrooms and onions. He really liked it.

Staff were very nice and friendly. They made small talk and thanked us for coming. 

Highly recommend!",4S66rkf9lbio692CQCsCDA,2,1,4,yIBj6_cqZnMjyqB9SbvGDA

Most moist, tender chicken I have ever had at a fast food joint. I was so pleasantly surprised. We were staying at the M/C so I knew I would be back the next day. They make them to order, so it takes a few extra minuets compared to McD's just next door. They do not charge for Ranch or Blue cheese - another pleasantl surprise there too. I tried their Nathan's Chili Cheese Dog the next day. I wished I would have stuck to the strips, It was just okay (took a star away for that). I wouldn't describe the chicken as ""crispy"" so much - but you could tell it was freshly battered, freshly cooked, and it was tasty w/out any sauce or extras.

Johnny Rockets next door doesn't have chili cheese fries because it's an express location, not what I thought it was.  I went here and saw the Philly Cheesesteaks are $14!   I decided to order a regular fry and top it with chilli and cheese.  I needed a quick dinner before Cher's concert tonight.  Food was hot but wasn't happy they added two little scoops of chilli, that was a $2 upcharge.  I asked for another scoop because it was all cheese.

I went back the next day for more. Seriously - they have it down to a science - the flavor/seasoning in the batter is great, the portion size is impressive for the Strip (everything's expensive here), and the sweet potato fries kick a$$ too.

It's pretty expensive compared to other places in terms of how much one gets for the money they pay, though, so I rarely eat here when I go to the food court except when I feel like eating a hot dog.

First of all, before this location at Monte Carlo I had only tried the location at Luxor, stroll very good, but this location at Monte Carlo is 5 times better. Just as u bite into the tender it is just so juicy and hot. And the fries are very moist and squishy just how I like, and u actually do get more fries here. 

Point is, lol, u can't choose from either a 3,4,or 5 piece meal with fries and special sauce, or u can substitute it for sweet potato fries. Drinks are separate. I did take note that there are also several milkshake options. As well as choosing a tender sandwich with Texas toast or a regular hamburger bun, of course topped with the special sauce. 

This location is combined with a Nathan's Hot Dogs. Takes about 7 minutes for your meal to be cooked.
