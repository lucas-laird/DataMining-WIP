This is at the food court in the Second Floor of the Excalibur Hotel. The most basic platter with coffee is $$11.10 and you cannot say the five powerful words ""charge it to my room"" and make it happen. They do take credit cards, including AMEX.

You might still be hungry at the end of your meal. But, the tater tots & pre-scrambled eggs do the job for a lil while.

They have no salsa but you could ask for buffalo sauce to  kickstart the eggs. I don't think they have honey for the biscuits; so, I used syrup. 

Seating could get limited in their newly remodeled dining area but it comes & goes. 

Do the math: Whether to spend $11 and get only basic calories here -- or -- $30 for buffet/sit down full course breakfast? What do you feel like today? 

In comparison, Johnny Rockets also serves platters and have a 50% off coupon in their paper placemats. Their platters have more meats, like bacon. And, you can charge it to your room there~

This place is in the food court of the Excalibur Hotel and Casino on the strip. It's okay... and just okay. Nothing special other than they have their own seating. They sell burgers and breakfast. 

Everything on their menu comes in a combo. If you just want a burger you still pay the combo price -$1 only. Nothing special other than breakfast all day, but you can get that from Mcdonalds, or Jack in the Box. It wasn't too expensive compared to other places to eat.

Why I withheld 2 stars: We were a little disappointed that we weren't allowed to switch tater tots for fries in the combos we ordered. Also when we got back to our room we hungrily unwrapped our sandwiches to learn the meat patty was missing from both sandwiches!

-----------------------------------------------
We stopped by here for a quick breakfast before going to grab the RTC located in front of Excalibur. 

Quite an average tasting egg muffin breakfast other than the fact that the pairings actually come with the muffin AND an order of tater tots as well. (I'm sure you can order just a muffin on it's own but it wasn't listed on the menu). Nonetheless, I've never had tater tots for breakfast before since I'm a loyal fan of the fast-food hashbrowns so it was a good way to change things up. 

Overall, there's not too many breakfast options in the food court so if you need something quick and easy, this could be one of those go-tos.",bvtrWhygO8f0nhVF4ua0Cg,1,0,2,qvEBFp0GjEgWKnsaIRRVlg
