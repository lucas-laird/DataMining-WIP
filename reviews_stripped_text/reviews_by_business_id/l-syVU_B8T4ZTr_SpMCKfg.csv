It appears it had been on the press some time and is not cooked to order. A very angry customer was having a run in with the manager, which was not being dealt with effectively. This was difficult to watch and listen too. 
I think it's very offensive when the supervise decided to talk to her staff about the customer in her native tongue as well as laughing. Very unprofessional indeed.",DKjNs8YAZJ2-xSgcdHek6w,0,0,2,tLyNPTgfxtmC1phrifCI1g

 Upon pulling in a heavily accented voice said ""Hold on"" and disappeared for over 5 minutes.. Once she finally returned it was very hard to communicate with the person on the other end of the speaker as she did not understand English hardly. We attempted to order 4 different basic meals. No substitutes, nothing special, just the meals and the drinks. We got to the window and waited another 5 minutes. Once we got the food we had to remind them of our drinks (one being sweet tea that was hot as if it just came out of the brew machine with no ice) and also had to get sauce/napkins/utensils. Once we got home and started opening up the food we discovered ALL 4 meals were wrong. We did not receive a receipt so we googled the location and called to complain. Upon speaking with the general manager she denied to credit or note our issue because we didn't have a receipt number. I had to get back in my car and take all of the food back inside to get it fixed. When I showed to the store the employee and manager both had attitude about fixing the order.

The first of these 3 visits is not having product ready in such an under-demanding hour- 3:30 PM is ample of enough time to recover from a lunch hour and to begin work-ups for the dinner rush. But not for me. I had to wait for biscuits because their inability to foresee that they would be open.
The 2nd of these visits, they had run out of product for their Dippin' Chicken promotion.
The 3rd visit, they had the chicken for the promotion, but they were out of the sauce.

Or at least hire someone who that who can upkeep the company image and maximize the potential of this location.

I'm always skeptical when they ask you to pull foward when there are no cars behind you.  Im like ok Ill pull foward because of the potential customers that are not coming so you can keep a clear lane.  

Honeslty I should have checked but the cashier had a reassuring answer for us like she was gonna load us up on honey like it was a bank robbery.  Not the case!  Get home and we got all this delicious chicken and all these biscuits and basically no honey.  Bee's work overtime to provide the masses with their honey.

Popeyes is a chicken franchise that has been around for several decades now. Recently, the chain opened up several more stores in the Vegas Valley. After coming to this particular store on more than a few occasions, I can safely say that probably wasn't a good thing.

What is it with fast food restaurants hiring idiotic staff? They have screwed up my order numerous times (I order a chicken nuggets kids meal and get home and find a DRUMSTICK in there instead!?) The staff are utterly clueless, and half the time they don't know the answers to the questions you ask them.

One time the person ringing my transaction had the audacity to say ""have a nice day"" as if dismissing me, BEFORE GIVING ME MY DRINKS AND CHEESECAKE. 

Expect to repeat your order several times, because they don't listen the first time. 

Go here if you like the franchise and their food, but go at your own risk, and double-check your order when you get it.

So THAT girl disappeared and another one took over, and again tried to charge me $16!  I ordered a THIRD time.  Fortunately they have me a second drink, because they didn't know the first girl already gave me one, and I got a free piece of pie, because I was livid!  Check your orders people!!  She said everyone was new, but apparently no one got any training yet.",tnhWpS4N5-TNdm4X_V1OhA,1,0,1,11x4-U1zeuu5cvQD4fGeWw

Had to wait several minutes more to leave, because there's no way to get out. Won't be coming back.",CesKl0DobyfPT5UNZy_lmQ,1,0,1,tQstY4f-VT1sT_s1HuzTng

I don't go to Popeye's drive-thru expecting 5 star service. Or 1 star service for that matter.  It's fast food, I assume the employees are paid minimum wage and aren't particularly excited to be assisting anyone.  But daaaaaamn can this place make some chicken.  It doesn't come even slightly close to the amazing chicken I just had in Memphis, but for fast food, it's the best in town.

Stop complaining about the location, people.  If you think this is a bad area, I fear for you guys.  Boulder Highway gets a bad rap in general, but you have to head another direction for any trouble.  In my opinion.  I live further South on the highway (on the way towards Boulder City), and I've never had any issues.  In fact, I love the area.

Anywho....my only gripe about this location is that they seem to ALWAYS screw up my order (oddly enough, they didn't this trip).  It is also pretty far out of the way - not exactly convenient, so I don't go here often.  It is really frustrating to get home and find out they forgot something in your order, because there is no way I'm going back, and just wasted $$.  They probably do that on purpose.

The chicken is delicious.  But in my opinion, it's the sides that set them apart from any other chicken location.  The red beans and rice are a must have.  I LOVE the spicy gravy on the mashed potatoes, and the cajun fries are absolutely amazing.  I like to order the spicy chicken fingers and dip them in the mashed taters instead of a dipping sauce (like a true fat kid).  The biscuits aren't great, but they are pretty good when smothered in red beans and rice!

The prices are a bit outrageous, definitely more than other fast food places.  It's like $14.99 for an 8 piece family meal with 1 side and biscuits.  C'MON! Really?  Pretty ridiculous, but as I said, the chicken is delicious, crispy and spicy.

Not someplace I tend to frequent, but on occasion, it's a good stop.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,6,2,3,K8RwqTP7STG2kYKTT7vBLw
