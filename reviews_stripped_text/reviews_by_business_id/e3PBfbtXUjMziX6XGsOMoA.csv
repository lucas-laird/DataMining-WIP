The food was on another level of good. Pure feelings of nostalgia filled my head from my trip to Japan. I got a kake udon, which is the most well known udon. It was taste wise and looks wise just like the one I had in Japan. As I was ordering it, a man who turned out to be the owner asked if I want a soft boiled egg and I replied of course, which he replied with ""that is the only way to eat udon."" I later waved him down to compliment him on his success so far. He was one of the most passionate guys I've ever met. This place has so much going for it.

I apologized and said it was my first time. She assumed I had been there before. I was confused about the sides she was asking if I wanted. For that reason, I thought maybe I had to build my udon bowel. From the picture, it appeared that it included all the necessary ingredients that were in the picture. I guess the sides were if people wanted more tempura, etc. in their udon. In the picture, it seemed it had more than enough ingredients, so I passed on the sides. They need to explain their process a bit. Finally, I got the udon. It was just OK. It was a bit salty and didn't have a smooth-tasting dashi base.

the idea of picking out tempura, although I have one slight complaint about it...it was a bummer that the tempura was kind of cold..my guess from sitting out for too long since it is served cafeteria style.

As a native of Japan, I was looking forward to visiting this new Udon restaurant.
Overall, they're serving pretty authentic Sanuki Udon, however my first impression was the soup is too cowardly.
It should be served very hot and even the soup stock could be much lighter brown by using more Dashi and mirin. 
That's how the authentic Sanuki Udon Soup used in Western Japan should be.

Also I thought the Cashier is the key for the entire operation.
Although all of my order were serviced at each kitchen section within a minutes, I had to wait to check-out for 5 mins.
It doesn't make sense as Udon restaurant to make customer wait for so long.
We, as customers want to enjoy freshly made noodles and soup right away.

I'd like to visit there again to see how their operation made progress.
When I visited there, kitchen staff were still in training, and it looked only a manager knows how each section runs in the kitchen. Obviously all cooks need more time for cross training in order to make them flexibly workable at any sections. 
Especially Tempura deep fryer should be kept clean.
I'm sure it's not that easy to maintain the deep fryer equipment as using lots of flour & oil. 
However, if the restaurant firmly wants to keep the ""open kitchen concept"", each cook should stay on top on cleanness and maintaining equipments.
I saw there're lots of rooms to grow the business in this town. 
Therefore I appreciate the owner bringing in the beautiful Udon culture to this town.

Upon coming here, you can notice that it is very similar to an authentic udon bar found in Japan (as said by my boyfriend, who has been to many udon places in Japan). When you come in, you see a display of plastic udon bowls, giving an example of what to expect. It's similar to a buffet line; you grab a tray and tell the chefs what you want. After you grab your udon or rice bowl, you are lead to a line of 8-10 different types of tempura. You grab a plate and get as many or as little tempura pieces as you want. At the very end of the line, you end up at the cash register and pay for your food. 

Now to the food. The food here is AMAZING. The udon was clearly fresh and had a good bite to it. The broth was tasty and not overpowering. The beef pieces were thinly sliced and tender. The tempura were all crispy and the veggies used for them (as I had the pumpkin and sweet potato) were lightly seasoned and delicious. The surprising part of the meal was how delicious their lemonade was! It's sweet but not too sweet while having a slight tartness to it. In addition, it also had a hint of the lemon rind in the drink.

The menu items are all in pictures with the name and a corresponding number. Just in case you mutilate the pronunciation, I am not naming names here, I am just saying! The ordering process is simple and has the efficiency of a well managed school cafeteria. You grab a tray, place your order by number or well spoken food item name and receive your food. Then you move along, see if you want to pick up a little extras and then pay for your food as well as order your drink.

I wanted a rice dish but I also wanted the freshly made udon, so I ordered both- problem solved. For my rice dish, I ordered the #19 the Curry Rice with Pork Katsu and the #5 Kamaage Udon. The Kamaage Udon comes straight from the cauldron of noodles so it is saltier and comes with dipping sauces. So the Kamaage Udon comes in a bucket, I am not joking. A big bucket of noodles, that is so my thing The noodles were fresh and simple, you could taste the purity of the noodles without the distraction of toppings.

The Curry Rice with Katsu was quite alright. The rice was rice and the katsu was a generous size. It was crispy and tender, very good! The curry, I think it was good. I mean I ate it. For the price of $7.45 I will not complain but it was a bit generic but it could also be my taste buds. 

Everyone who worked at this new Café were top-notch kind and helpful. Definitely a place that I will come back to with all of it's details! All in all, the new Café Saunuki is pretty solid with food for the prices they charge.",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,8,5,4,iaVumlOOqJAge2HuU-VF6A

Yaki Udon was 7.45 and Nabeyakin Udon was 9.45. They are both great value.

You pick your udon and side dishes and pay at the counter. They will give you a pager to beep you when your food is ready to pick up at the counter. Their system is pretty close to ""Hanamaru Udon"" chain in Japan which is my favorite.

I am a Japanese and have been back to Japan many times in recent years. Their Japanese style udon is authentic. I am not quite sure about Cabonara or Tomato sauce udon, but may be I will be brave and try next time. 

The restaurant is spacious and clean with great service (although it's self-serve, the workers were attentive and offered to clean up our table).

I will go back there again. I found my little Japanese spot in Las Vegas!",jQVRFLsxd1sTHhBzoTE1Ew,0,0,5,kNvE73VLcxEve-UfYl9i9Q
1432165,2017-11-17,7,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Yes, this place is the spot.

The fast casual approach to udon. All of the noodles are made in house so you know it's fresh. There is an open kitchen where you can see everything being made. The system is really easy to understand when ordering. The udon soups are really great. The noodles are amazing, and the broths they use are very good. They even have really creative udon dishes like carbonara and seafood tomato.

Cafe Sanuki also has tempura. They were light and crispy. If you don't want udon, you can get a rice bowl. I tried the pork belly bowl, it was quite good. Hopefully they will carry oden soon, that stuff is awesome. 

The service was awesome, everyone was super friendly and eagar to assist.

I will definitely be back, this is a great idea, and the food is quick and really well done.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,19,20,5,J89vJMByLu3ik9-6mpNaTA
1438104,2018-04-04,1,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Came here for dinner with some friends during their Noodle Extravaganza event on 03/19/18. The lines were much improved compared to their soft opening days but they still ran out of eggs ! (well for the tempura anyway... at least I still got one in my nabeyaki at least)

This event was to promote a few of their new items

Nabeyaki Udon - Hot udon noodle soup cooked and served in individual iron pot. Special kake based soup filled with seasoned beef, mushrooms, and cabbage topped with fishcake, shrimp tempura, and a Japanese poached egg. 

Miso Sesame Pork over Rice - Sauce made from blend of 6 difference sauces and 2 types of chilis

Garlic Chicken Udon Salad - Iceberg Lettuce Salad Mix, Cucumbers, Radish, Cherry Tomatoes on a bed of freshly made udon topped w/ special seasoned fried chicken karaage served with a sweet soy garlic dressing

Mentaiko Ochazuke Rice - Pour salted dashi broth over a bed of white rice and fragrant crispy rice topped with Mentaiko on a bed of scallions

Shabu Shabu Udon Salad - Fresh Spring Salad Mix and bell peppers on a bed of freshly made udon topped with thin sliced pork belly, cherry tomatoes, and served with a sweet miso sesame dressing

Of course we had to try the new Nabeyaki Udon, and I've always wanted to try ochazuke rice bowls. 

The nabeyaki udon serving is really big. I'm not sure if it was because I was currently going through a bout of a stomach bug (most likely cuz I know im more of a piggy than this normally...) Lots of veggies. Only complaint was the broth was a bit sweet. I don't know if their ""special kake based soup"" is originally sweet but I know the beef is cooked in a sweet base too. Questioned if it was my appetite but others agreed to the sweetness as well. I still wonder if I can request the udon to be cooked less. I keep forgetting about this until I eat the udon. Lol The poached egg was yummy. Super silky and creamy yolk. 

Mentaiko Ochazuke Rice... wait I was supposed to get salted dashi broth? o well. I over ordered anyway and couldn't even eat this, nor the mentai onigiri I had gotten as well. LOL sad face. I ended up moving the mentai over to the mentai cream pasta which was shared between the few of us. 

The mentai onigiri (which I ate the next morning) was fairly decent. The mentai is actually more spread throughout the onigiri than ones I've had in the past at other places which gives more of a spread mentai experience vs all in the middle. pretty good :]",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,sgerHsk2mbVoa2MGltDkPA
1439306,2018-02-27,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Fairly new udon place that is still trying to get their place together.  Reminds me of a restaurant in Hawaii with the same concept. You go in, pick your broth that you want and let the server know. They have sides that you can pick from, such as shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, chicken karaage. They also have other food options like the pork bao (which my friend wasn't too happy with).

Portion size was perfect. Broth was tasty, however it was luke warm and I'd like for it to be steaming hot. Udon itself was chewy.  Disappointed with the sides as they were cold and not fresh and crispy. The karaage was however flavorful. 

I was bummed that they didn't have the correct egg for the udon I had ordered and thus had to choose something else. I would underatand if it was near closing but I went in around 8pm so dont know why they didn't have any available. The server was apologetic. Service was fairly good, everyone was very friendly.

The udon was cooked perfectly without being too chewy. And wow, $9.95 is definitely a bargain for the generous portions of shrimp, squid, mussels, and fish they provide.

The owner took some time to chat with us. He stated the soft boiled eggs they use are shipped direct from Japan! All ingredients are fresh. In fact they do not have any freezers in the kitchen. They do not use MSG or other artificial flavors in their dishes. They have a self serve bar for your warm tempura sauce and drinks where you have an option to pump your own Torani syrups with all kinds of flavors.

You order the type of noodles you want and then you can pick out the different types of tempura you want (whole egg, squid, shrimp, assorted veggies, etc).  The food is very affordable (but if you cannot resist adding a ton of tempura to your meal, like me, the prices do add up ).  I had the Kitsune Udon (dashi broth with tofu) both times. My favorite tempura is the whole egg (with runny center) and asparagus.  I also tried the salmon rice balls which were good but I felt like they could have been more generous with the filling.

First of all, the cashier/manager/whatever was very very rude when we were ordering. Not to mention the weird ordering system they had where you take a tray, order, and go pay. We ordered 2 different udons, 1 rice, and a pork belly bao - one of our udons came out within a minute and the other we had to wait 10 minutes for! After we ordered all of them together, they gave us a pager for one of our udons and they said it takes longer to cook. We sat and waited for it and when it took too long, we asked them when it would be ready, they said another 5 minutes but it really didn't come out for another 10. It wasn't the waiting that was the problem; The cashier messed up our order and the entire paging thing threw the kitchen off so it was as if we never ordered to begin with. What pissed us off most was that so many people ordered the exact same thing and got theirs within the minute we got our other udon.
The cashier/manager obviously knew I was scrolling through yelp when he walked behind me back and forth so he rushed off and got us tempura ""on the house."" He also told us that they didn't have any more pork belly bao (which we also had been waiting for with the pager - how long does it take to make a dang bao?!) but we saw that other people at other tables were eating it also so we insisted we get a refund.

1920876,2017-12-03,9,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Advertised as an ""authentic, Japanese-style cafeteria"", I came to Cafe Sanuki's soft opening harboring some apprehension- cafeteria style food in the US doesn't exactly evoke positive opinions of quality eats. But the term seems to be referring exclusively to the fact that food is ordered, made, and received in a tray line. Staff were allegedly sent to Japan to learn the correct cooking techniques and the majority of cooking supplies from eggs to a particular brand of tofu are shipped in for authenticity.

I visited with friends and tried a variety of udon dishes, ""hand rolls"" (called onigiri elsewhere),tempura,  and don buri and the quality was solid. Noodles are long and chewy, with a carefully timed boil and weighed portions. The more traditional udon dishes seemed to fare better than the fusion options like carbonara and tomato-seafood. I am not typically a big fan of udon noodles but I enjoyed the meals I had here- the yaki udon dish in particular was huge and fresh, with a light and flavorful sauce that stuck well to the noodles and kept them from tasting plain. I will eventually have to try the bukkake dish too, for obvious reasons...

The miso-garlic pork belly bowl is a small portion that packs a punch of flavor. Others praised the beef bowl and curry options, but I'll have to go back for those. Their tempura station is cool but perhaps due to their new opening and slow line speeds, some of the received product was cold and/or soggy, so this may be an option better chosen when you can see it being put out hot and fresh. Also of note is their tea station, featuring several exclusive blends and a variety of flavored syrups to customize.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,14,4,TAdjvRc5BeTudwrJLnB5ug

So there is a buffet style set up, you would think that you can get the noodles then grab whatever tempura you want then pay and go grab a table. But not, you get the noodles, then you tell the guy which tempura you want then you can either stay there and wait for it or they will bring it to you. They do not have a numbering system so the staff walked around with the food asking table by table if the food is theirs...why have the buffet set up if you have to order then wait for the food anyways?

The food is not bad but extremely overpriced for what it is. My brother got the large garlic pork belly bowl and it was so small, just rice and the meat...which didn't even look like pork belly, it looked like teriyaki beef. 

The udon on its own is about $6 which is not bad at all but the tempura were ridiculously overpriced. $1.50 or 1 piece of sweet potato or pumpkin, $1.75 for a pretty small shrimp. Neither the udon or the broth were special enough that I have to come back.

I love the display of the plastic food as soon as you walk in. They look so realistic! It also reminded me of the time I was at the Japanese airport with my mom and little bro oohing and ahhing at the plastic food display because we never saw something so beautiful lol. 

Anyways, I got the yaki udon and grabbed 2 shrimp tempura and 1 tempura fried egg. Once I paid for my food, the lady gave me a beeper to alert me when my yaki udon was done. 

Sooo...this is the part that kind of irked me. I sat at the table waiting for my noodles and waited...and waited...and waited. I probably waited a good 20-25 minutes before a nice young lady came up to me and asked me if I got my food. I told her no and that I was still waiting. She then said she'll check with the kitchen and after a few minutes, she came back and informed me they were making it now and apologized for the wait. I'm not exactly sure what happened...maybe my ticket didn't go through? It was a good thing I wasn't in a hurry. 

Onto the food, the tempura is bomb. So nicely fried and crispy without being heavy. The yaki udon was flavorful and the consistency of the noodles itself was nice. If I were to suggest one thing is to add more meat into the dish. 

So even with the unexpected wait time, I do plan on coming back and trying out the other dishes that they offer and the lemonade! I've read the lemonade is quite tasty. Hopefully next time I won't have to wait as long.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,3,4,4,ElruaUfnLdxW33g4PQPMHg

The hubby wanted to come here to try their curry katsu (not sure why as it is more focused on udon) so we came in for lunch.

I had a hard time choosing from all the options. It was exciting watching the noodle maker cooking fresh noodles in the large pot. I ended up getting a bowl of niku udon with a garlic miso pork belly mini bowl which I shared with my toddler. We also bought a few tempura to try (sweet potato, kabocha squash).

We used the Yelp check-in to get a free drink too.

Okay, the niku udon was good solid rendition. The noodles had a nice texture and flavor. The kiddo gobbled up her portion and was quite content. The garlic miso bowl was also quite tasty and would easily recommend.

The tempura batter was light and crisp. It's self service for the dipping sauce at the condiments station.

Their specially blended house-made lemonade was dubbed ""baby crack"" by the end of the visit. My kid barely came up to breathe as she sucked the delicious concoction through the straw. The rest of the day, all she could talk about was how much she wanted more lemonade. The lemonade is very different from traditional lemonade - it's less acidic and slightly more creamy(?). It's not quite yuzu, and maybe the creaminess may have some coconut overtones to it? It's really hard to pinpoint what it is but it is good.

The only disappointment was the curry katsu. The curry was a little thin and generic tasting while the batter kind of just fell off the pork chop. 

As a restaurant, it is pretty great place for kids. The area and high chairs are clean. The restaurant staff is very nice and helpful. They came by and offered my daughter her first taiyaki (she liked this too but not as much as the lemonade). Service is quick and efficient. Only thing is the bathroom does not have a changing table for those with younger children.

For a quick bite, this place is hard to beat at these prices. Add in the friendly staff and ambience, this place warrants return visits. (4).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,1,4,S3Z2Par7y2Jo1r5wdBfiWQ

Their make their udon fresh from scratch and you can watch their action from the glass while you order your food. 

First, you waited in line to pick your udon/ rice bowl. They have over twenty udon variety from kake, bukake, carbonara, clam, tomato based, etc. They also have rice curry bowls as side order or main dish (BIG bowl). 

Second, you pick your sides: shrimp tempura, fish cakes and vegetable tempuras, spam musubi (yes they have it too), salmon or spicy tuna wrap, etc.

Last, you pick your drinks. Their lemonade is fresh squeezed and it's pretty good. They also have bottomless specialty brewed tea by Harney and Sons, peach, tropical green, etc. If you like sweet, they have syrups with many different flavors to add to your tea.  I tried their tropical green and it's very refreshing! If you check-in on Yelp, drink is on the house.

It's perfect for visual people. To your right, you order and pay. Sometimes your food will come out while you're waiting in line & if not, they give you a little pager so you can sit down & wait. The pager system is a bit confusing... it seemed like our orders kept getting mixed up with other customers (so just keep an eye out on what you actually ordered). While you wait in line, you can grab a variety of tempura & onigiri. Yum! 

I ordered the Untama udon & my egg was beautifully poached! If you are someone that doesn't want something too savory/salty, this is a good pick.
Next, the mental! While there may not be much mental, it packs a lot of flavor! A little goes a long way. 

Did I mention they have a huge selection with their soda fountain?! It's a bit overwhelming. They have a ton of flavors to choose from. Just try to drink a little before you sit back down. Two drinks I tried seemed a bit watered down.

That said, the service is very friendly and once they get into a groove and hit their stride, things will be a little faster and more efficient. 

The udon here is on point. Period. I had a nice soft boiled egg that was perfectly cooked.  I'd come back anytime and have udon any day. 

The tempura suffered from temperature issues but was beautifully cooked. I'm sure this will change as well as they get used to their service volume and turnover on tempura. 

I also had a mini beef rice bowl (gyu-don) that was really good. Now that Las Vegas no longer has a Yoshinoya, this could be a great replacement.

The atmosphere is really cool and inviting. They made great use of the space and are able to accommodate quite a few people. The J-pop playing in the restaurant is a nice touch.

I ordered the mentai cream udon while my guy ordered the carbonara udon (totally not because I kept saying how much I wanted both :^)). Both were deliciously creamy without giving me that heavy, overkill fatty feeling. The portions were also perfect. The mentai is definitely the lighter of the two, but I thought both of them were indescribably yummy and I highly recommend them. The miso pork belly bowl we added on to share was good, but nothing special and I probably wouldn't order it again. I would also pass on the onigiri as you can get these from any Japanese market for cheaper. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the fact that, if you go onto yelp, you have the option to get 10% off your bill or check in for a free drink (unlimited refills at the self serve drink bar). I suggest getting the drink if you're dining in because it's soo worth it. They have original calpico in the dispensers so you can drink as much of this as your heart desires. They also have other cool drinks like homemade blood orange tea, as well as your typical soda machines. The best part is that they have flavored syrup pumps at your disposal if you're feeling adventurous and want to try mixing your own concoction.

As a tip for newbies like myself, Cafe Sanuki is cafeteria style. Upon walking in, you may be confused but the layout is pretty simple. Decide what you want and order with the cooks--while you wait for your meal, you have the option to pick up some tempura, etc from their hot bar. After this, you pay at the cashiers. That's it.

Came here this evening with my wife and 2 year old son. We were warmly greeted by an exceptionally nice young lady named Jasmine (sorry if I spelled her name wrong) who gave us great recommendations. The staff at the order counter were personable and fun. After paying, Jasmine helped carry one of our trays to our table since my wife was carrying our son. She cleared the trays, and proceeded to check back with us regularly throughout our dinner. The food was very good- I got a Katsu which was HUGE and my wife got an udon she really enjoyed! The food I would give a 4/5, keeping in mind that this is a cafeteria style place- it's not a 5 Star restaurant so ratings need to adjust accordingly, right? At one point I needed to go get a drink for my Son, and they had a long line, so I asked if I could just grab a drink cup, and come back and pay for it later. Jasmine handed me a drink cup, and said not to worry about it. That seems like a very little thing, right? Its hard sometimes explaining exactly what makes exceptional service exceptional- it can be a bit intangible, you know? I've had waiters do everything right and still be subpar because they were clearly going through the motions- I think the service here is a step above because it's WARM. Like, the staff actually care about being nice, and they are very genuine. So I guess I could talk about their thoughtfulness and attention to detail too, but it ultimately comes down to actually caring, which they do. 

We will definitely come back here, and probably would even come back if we were less impressed with the food. Management, if you read this, make Jasmine a manager or give her a store, whatever. You can train people really well, but you can't train authenticity- a person has it, or they don't. Your staff has it, and I was happier with Jasmine than I have been with waiters in many 5-Star restaurants.",JtHVrkI0ghsmhYXD4xXe1w,0,2,5,S8aFYihMINPle4_rpG0IpQ

2710556,2018-06-15,25,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Cafe Sanuki is a Japanese cafeteria style restaurant that specializes in the art of traditional Udon noodles. Their equipment and ingredients are imported from Japan. Prior to opening the restaurant, they met with Udon Masters and even had Minimoto-san spend several months in Vegas training their Chefs to provide an authentic Japanese Udon experience. 

I was so excited for Cafe Sanuki so I definitely purchased more food than I could handle. As an appetizer, I decided to get some Tempura items. They have a selection of 10 different types of tempura and you are able to pay per piece per type. I chose Asparagus ($1.25), Pumpkin ($1.25), Sweet Potato ($1.25), Fish Cake ($1.75) and Shrimp ($1.75). The batter was very crispy and I really enjoyed every piece. The tempura is pretty pricey compared to the rest of the menu and since it lays around, it could get a bit oily. 

The highlight of my experience is definitely their Udon. With so many options, I struggled to narrow down my choices, but eventually I decided on the #7 Ontama Bukake Udon ($6.45). This is a warm udon noodle with a perfectly poached egg, onions and tempura flakes with the Udon broth on the side. With the broth on the side, your noodles will maintain its' ideal consistency and the tempura flakes won't get soggy if you wait too long to eat it. The noodles were evenly shaped with the perfect amount of elasticity. After I poured in the broth and broke the poached egg, they mixed together and coated the noodles.  It was so delicious, I can't wait to come back for more. I would have been happier if there was more broth though. 

With the order of Udon, the small rice bowls are a discount price. I couldn't pass up a good deal for variety so I decided on getting a small Curry Katsu Rice Bowl ($2.50). The curry was a bit lacking by compare but still decent. It was definitely good value. 

Take advantage of the Yelp Check-In deal for a free beverage. They have plenty of drink options such as a fancy custom Coke machine, freshly brewed Harney & Sons Tea, special blended Cafe Sanuki Lemonade and even Calpico. Their Drink station even had flavor pumps for you to add to your preference. I just got the Calpico and it was very refreshing with my meal. 

Since they are cafeteria style, please remember to take your trays and bowls and put them away. The workers actually went around to help clear finished plates and even when I took my tray to the trash area, they offered to help me put it away. Service was definitely friendly and efficient. 

I highly recommend Cafe Sanuki. It was such an incredible meal for a good value. Well, good value if you stick to the udon and small rice bowl. Trust me, even the international Japanese travelers seemed to really enjoy this place.",W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA,32,32,5,9uIy5IYqvFZeB4uhFP5ZQA

Thankfully, Chinatown never fails to deliver cheap, filling food packed with flavor, and Sanuki is no exception. There's more than a dozen inventive styles of udon to try. I ate the curry udon, and though the broth was thin, the flavors held fast to the hand pulled noodles. The cafe operates in a lunch line, which limits the throughput of guests, but adds a casual atmosphere and lets you see what you're buying. Though Sanuki is a noodle bar, don't forget to pick up the tempura and onigiri. The chefs have a great understanding on how to fry something perfectly (without bumping up your cholesterol). The rice bowls are delightful, and the portion is large. The regular bowl is the size of an entree, and 8 bucks isn't bad for the quality. Make sure to check in to get a free drink.

The staff was very friendly in getting me to try a second bowl. I've been to the restaurant that Mr Fan first went to in Waikiki and the noodles there and also Jumbo and Iyo were both firm and chewy. I haven't been to the Sanuki region of Japan so maybe its supposed to be mushy?? In either case I would have definitely given a 5 star rating if the noodles (which should be the star of the show) weren't mushy.

1-We order the pork belly baos, chef came out minutes after purchasing that he was out of pork belly baos. 

2- We got 2 mini bowls in place of the ""pork belly baos"" which really didn't solve anything. 

3-Included in the order was also katsu curry bowl that was long delayed. Went to cashier and she said they forgot the order. Took about another 40 minutes for that dish to come out.

4-The buzzer buzzed i walked up to get the food as I'm reaching for the dish I was told it wasn't for me they buzzed the wrong number. 

5. Was told one of the chef walked out on them earlier in the day and they're short staffed, but there was 6 people behind the counter at 8pm with only 3 other customers. Hmm.

The staff were all nice, so that's a plus. I ordered the kike udon and curry katsu. In all honesty, I think they got their playing wrong. The curry katsu came in a bowl that's bigger than my sink, it was like obnoxiously huge lol. The udon, I know they make the noodles on site, but honestly, it's not as good as the prepackaged ones. The noodles don't have the texture and the feel of udon noodles that I like. The food overall wasn't really that good to me. So overall, this restaurant is a solid 3 star.

Grab a tray and let the person working know what number you'd like then grab as much tempura as you want. Plenty of seating and workers are super helpful. 

They offer extra noodle options for $2 more I believe. They make the noodles fresh and sometimes you can see them making it in front of you! The tempura is made fresh. I highly recommend the soft boiled egg and shrimp tempura. The sweet potato tempura was just eh. I think it could have been cooked a bit longer. 

My go to is the niku udon since it has beef and the broth is light, not too salty. I've also added the miso garlic pork belly bowl to my niku udon and thought the pork belly was too salty. I was expecting sort of like a braised fatty piece but the pieces were very thin and on the chewy side. My friends enjoyed the curry udon and seafood tomato cream.

Before anything else, let me just say that this place straight up reminds me of Shirokiya in Hawaii. Every time I go back home to the islands, I always hit up that place that is located in Ala Moana Center. And now, a part of it has magically warped into Las Vegas!

As soon as you enter, you will see a display case of everything they have on the menu. It gives the names of all the menu items and little descriptions of what each one is. It is like a lil udon museum. So cheesy, I know. :p

Pricing is not bad at all and seems to be about the same as other places. Maybe even cheaper, but worth it. This gives you a chance to try other menu items, since the portions are not overwhelming.

The restaurant has a walk-up line where you order and pick up your food. Just like a cafeteria, you get a tray, order, and wait for your food to be prepared before making a final stop at the cash register to pay. After your main dishes are prepared, you will come across a small section of add-on items. Some of these items include a variety of tempura, chicken skewers, soft boiled eggs, and spam musubi. After all that, seating is your choice. This restaurant is pretty sizable and there are plenty of tables and chairs throughout.

Now for my fave menu items and recommendations. I have tried the Kitsune Udon, Seafood Tomato Cream, Mentai Cream Udon, and the Beef Rice. As for add-ons, I've tried the shrimp/squid tempura, chicken skewers, and spam musubi. I highly recommend the Mentai Cream Udon. It had just the right amount of flavor, wasn't too salty, and it was just delicious. The broth and noodles of the Kitsune was just as good, so I'm pretty sure the flavors of the rest would be too. There was nothing special about the Beef Rice, but it was a nice little add-on. Plus, you can order the rice dishes in mini or regular sized bowls. A great option when wanting to try several different menu items.

All in all, this place is really great to hit up when you want a quick and simple meal. Udon is comfort food and there's nothing more satisfying than a bowl of noodle soup when the craving for something hot and soothing is just too real. lol If you're in the area, make the stop! :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,7,3,4,Kvess42rvxyCZ7euQlViRw

I ordered a #7, thinking that it would come with soup because that is how it is shown in display and on the menu. However when it was served, there was no soup and the noodles were warm. I was also served a sauce in it's container but no hot soup was with my order. So I thought maybe the sauce would be enough to act as a soup to dip my noodles in, but come to find out, the container was already empty... At this point I was very confused and realized my order was not correct. By the time I spoke with one of the workers and they gave me the hot broth, my noodles were cold so the broth did not settle well with the now lukewarm soup. 
I never really ever complain about food. It was just really confusing because the customer after me ordered #7 as well and we both didn't get a hot broth or soup to begin with. This makes me question if the kitchen has been serving this dish without it's hot broth or soup. I expected it to be in the bowl with the noodles served hot, just as the menu depicts it. 
To end this review on a better note, at least they got my boyfriend's order correct. He ordered a #10, which they had to bring out to our table. The lemonade is also different from other lemonades I've tried, interesting flavor.

3223768,2018-01-22,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Yoooo so check it out. If you want to check out a new hip and happening place without breaking the bank then Cafe Sanuki is the place to be.

So this is a cafe style eatery, just like when we went to school. You would go grab a tray and pick up whatever food you wanted. This place does specialize in udon with homemade noodles so I do recommend you get at least one bowl among the other things.

Now I'm not going to lie to you. The udon is definitely not the best but it is for sure better than most. I don't even like udon but this place keeps me coming back for more. The staff here is super friendly and will help you out with whatever you need.

Now for the best bit...my review of some of the food there:
Niku Udon - This is a basic hot udon with beef and onions and broth. This does have the option to add an egg to it which I do like for a small fee. This is a great udon to have if you aren't feeling adventurous as you can't really go wrong with this one.
Kamaage Udon - This is a cool dip udon that comes in a bucket, and before you ask (when you see the display case at the restaurant) the udon does come in that giant bucket that you see. This is probably one of the bigger servings of udon offered by this place which is something that I enjoy. Basically you get a bucket of udon with broth on the side and you take udon from the bucket and put in the broth and eat it from the little bowl of broth. This helps keep the natural flavor of the udon without diluting it with broth which I thoroughly enjoyed.
Curry Udon - If you like udon and you like Japanese curry, then you get the best of both worlds in this dish. Nuff said. Although I do have to mention the one time I did get this dish I found it a little watery, probably from the udon water but this was still good. Not spicy at all so if you can't handle spice but want to eat curry, you can jump on this dish.
Beef Rice - Basically the same toppings you would get on the Niku Udon but on rice. I enjoyed this bowl more than I did with the udon only because I think the flavors work better with rice but that's just my opinion.
Variety Tempura - The tempura here is just your basic tempura. A must grab for sure. They do have a tempura sauce station next to the drink station so don't forget to get some dipping sauce for these delectable morsels. I do suggest getting the fish cake tempura though (the one that looks like a tube of blisters). It doesn't look that great but tastes amazing. I haven't seen any other places with this kind of fish cake so this is definitely a must try if you haven't tasted it yet.
Variety Onigiri - This place has a bunch of onigiri which is cool to get if you want to feel like you're eating a cute bento in Japan. They have a bunch of fillings. The one that I do not recommend is the spam one. I grabbed one on accident and it is just a not good masubi. Mentai is my favorite onigiri which is a slightly spicy cod fish filling. This one has the most flavor out of the ones that I have eaten.
Taiyaki - This is basically a cake in the shape of a fish that has red bean paste. This is a dessert so be sure to enjoy this at the end of your meal. This is what all the kids in those animes you watch eat so get this to submerge yourself in the otaku culture. It is pretty tasty but does not compare to the real thing so don't get your hopes up that high.
KARAAGE - No the caps were not a mistake. I wanted to use that to grab your attention because I think this is one of the best items they have at this place. If you do not know what karaage is, it is basically just deep fried chicken. However they cook it makes this chicken so dang juicy. I have had a lot of karaage in the past and this is one of the best. It is extremely flavorful as well. Try to get the hot ones when they come out of the kitchen if you can as those are the best ones but even the ones that are sitting under the heating light are pretty bomb as well. I get these every time I come here.
Oden - At the end of the line you have the option of getting some fish hot pot. I do enjoy this a lot and I do not enjoy normal hot pot. This is just a nice compliment to your meal especially on a cold winter's day and you just need some soup to warm up your soul.

For my final tips, be sure to check the times that this place is open. This place does have a break between 3pm and 5pm. Also you do get a free drink for checking in on yelp so might as well take advantage of that offer while it is still available ;) Other than that just enjoy yourself in this awesome atmosphere.

Happy Eating!",Y5Jn7FKHubCVjl5qZjA3yg,0,0,4,MQQNIyiRGEigKOstobVcpw

Their lemonade is pretty good, it is a bit creamy but still light and refreshing. Atmosphere is pretty nice, lots of tables, nice lighting.

Cafeteria style udon joint where you pick an udon base and choose your tempura toppings. They also have rice bowls that you can order instead of the udon. 

I got the curry udon, and it was ok. It wasn't the best udon I've ever had, nor was it the worst. Marukame udon in Waikiki really set the bar for me. Not sure if they hand-make the noodles here, but the udon noodles tasted like they were pre-packaged. I actually like the packaged udon noodles that they sell in the Asian markets so I'm not complaining. The tempura, however, was cold! No bueno!

Not many choices for udon here in Vegas. It's either Monzo or here. If you want something quick, Cafe Sanuki wouldn't be a bad choice.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,7,5,4,9lAn5dNfPb9YCoq4uLGsNA

You order what you want at the counter and they will bring it out to you. One thing I noticed was that the workers were very attentive and nice when I was ordering! 

There are a lot of choice of things to get here. I personally got to try the nabiaki udon, mentai cream, beef rice, pork belly bao and a couple of rice rolls. The amount of food you get for the price is great. They give you a lot of food and it tastes pretty good. 

The nabiaki is a good way to get a variety of items in your bowl. 

The mentai cream was pretty delicious, different from the soup style that udon usually comes with. 

The beef rice bowl was good, but nothing too special. It was just like any gyudon I have had in the past. 

The pork belly bao was pretty good. I really like how the pork belly was seasoned. 

The rice rolls were just OK. The fillings were good, but the rice itself was plain. I wished the rice had some additional taste to it.

Very cool concept.  The food is your typical tasty udon with a couple of different broths and temperatures.  But Sanuki goes a little further with the inclusion of tempura and oden on the menu to make you full on Japan.  You take a tray, put your order in, and make your way to pay, passing by all the fried goodness on your way to your seat.  Prices are very fair with the typical udon at $6.45.  Many options both vegetarian and with fish.  Quality, home-cooked noodles with a nice soft broth, though a little fishy at times.  I find udon a little empty at times as the dish is 95% broth and noodle, but Sanuki filled me up and was tasty to the last sip.  Very cool new entity in China Town.  Plenty of seating, easy parking, god eats...highly recommended.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,4,Pt8M-vykaIWn4huRxPoYgA
3335523,2018-01-17,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"I had the Niku Udon ($7.45). The noodles were firm, broth had a light taste, and not too salty.  Definitely better than packaged udon noodles which tend to have a slight gelatinous texture to them when reheated.  I added a soft boiled egg which ended up to be a little more cooked than I like for soft boiled.  I prefer a runny yolk.

Other items also tried - 
1.  Tempura - Pre-cooked and sitting on trays so don't expect it to be hot.Tried squid tempura and pumpkin tempura. Pumpkin tempura ($1.25) was nice.  Would not have the squid tempura ($1.75) again - no taste. 
2.  Onigiri - salmon, spam, and konbu - good filler since it's rice (3 for $4.00)
3.  miso pork belly mini rice bowl add on for $2.50 - tasty but a little sauce drizzled on top would elevate the flavor ($3.95 non add on price)
4.  pork belly bun - not a huge thick piece of pork belly, vegetables were crisp, light flavor, could use a little more sauce ($2.95)
5.  house lemonade - liked it was not too sweet and free drink with Yelp check in

Service is very friendly and organized.  Always feels good to have people smile at you, thank you for coming in and wish you a nice rest of your day.  They keep the tables and trash area clean too.  I noticed the girl at the cash would clean the tables almost as soon as the people left. She also asked to clear trays if you looked like you were finished.  Having clean tables makes the environment pleasant to dine in.

Would return to try other dishes.  Price point is good. Can eat for around $10.

PS.  Just checked my bill.  The add on Mini Miso Garlic Pork Belly Bowl should have been $2.50 but I was charged full price of $3.95.  They don't have a display at the cash where you can see your itemized bill before signing for it.

Cafe Sanuki, located in the city that never sleeps, has definitely created one of the most elevated Udon noodles around. 

Excellent characteristics and bite on the Udon noodles with a broth that's subtle in earthy flavors, yet it's effectiveness lingers with each slurp. 

Cafe Sanuki also offers Pork Belly Bao; delicate pork belly pieces inside a soft, steamed bun, with in house made slaw. It was simple and not clouded with unnatural flavors.

Tempura, rice rolls are also offered as a part of their ""Munchies"" menu and don't forget to order Oden ( fish cake, radish, Konjac or egg) as an addition to your Udon.

I might've had too much expectations as I've had udon in Hawaii and I dearly crave it! But this is pretty good. I can't compare it to Hawaii because we don't have anything close to it. 

I got a mini beef bowl. (Dangit, I wasn't thinking, I should've tried curry bowl instead of beef bowl with a beef udon ha!) yeahhhh it kinda tasted the same as my udon... But my bad! Still not bad tho! I had a bite of my SO's curry bowl and that wasn't too bad either however, I don't always have curry cravings.

When I walked in, the first thing that I noticed was the decor. I have not personally been to Japan, but my friend who has says that it looks authentic. There is a ceramic display case of their food options at the entrance and the interior is almost entirely wood. Japanese culture is littered around the dining room, such as mangas and other cute items. If you enjoy Japanese or cute interiors, this place has one the best in the city.

Even the way that the food is served is pretty unique. It almost mimics a cafeteria line. You grab a tray and have the option to select side orders, or order an entree. If getting an entree you will receive a buzzer to notify you when the food is ready.

Finally, the food. In addition to udon, they have a good selection of tempura, rice dishes, onigiri, etc. This is one of those restaurants where you have to take a picture of your food just because of how pretty the presentation is. I ordered the Nabeyaki udon, curry katsu, and the braised pork over rice. My friend had the carbonara udon. The portion sizes of the entrees here are pretty huge despite the price. The braised pork was extremely tender and was borderline liquid in the mouth. The katsu was crispy, and actually had appropriate portions of rice. The curry taste, in my opinion, is comparable to even Zen Curry. The udon was HUGE. Like it came in a pot lmao. It had so many flavors packed in, mushrooms, shrimp tempura, green onion, beef, etc. I loved all the dishes I got.

All in all, I would recommend this place. Great portion sizes, good taste, cute interior, and friendly staff. Can't wait to visit again.",Yh0811X62OorELbMIByMjw,1,0,5,ZlWZFZ5vg9c3AQrcrWXPHg

Walking into the place definitely gives you a wow impression. They have this huge glass case that presents their dishes and portion sizes. The atmosphere was spacious and calm. It was almost a full house. However it didn't sound noisy as I thought it would be. When you order you stand in line and they give you a pager. You have the option to grab some tempura before paying. When we went, there was not much left. There weren't any rice rolls either, which was something I was looking forward to try as well. 

My boyfriend and I ordered, Seafood Tomato Cream Udon, Nabeyaki and Pork Belly Bao. 
After ordering my boyfriend and I found a seat. We waited for the pager to buzz. 1st time it did, it was JUST my seafood dish that had been given. Lady at the register told me to keep the pager for our next order. Second order was delivered by them. Then a few minutes later, the pager buzzed. It was the Pork Belly Bao. The deliver of service was a bit confusing and all over the place.. I didn't really like the idea of walking across the room to grab my order one by one. Usually places that have pagers, your food is given to you all at once. Don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly and nice. Just the coordination was a little off. 
Going into the food, the quality of the Udon was perfect. It wasn't over cooked. It was chewy. Which I enjoyed. Although, my dish wasn't the greatest. Would I order it again? No. It tasted like the tomato sauce I would get at the store. The seafood wasn't fresh for sure (not that im saying they said it was). I serve at a seafood restaurant that serves fresh seafood, so it was easy to distinguish. My boyfriend got the Nabeyaki and he wasn't that fond of it either. Didn't stick out from the other places we had udon with. The broth didn't stand out to be exact. 
Third, the pork belly bao was definitely something we decided we'd order again. It was full of flavor. The bun was PERFECTION! I would come back for it.",hPoyOGAnbjJ6IKbJQ1UABQ,1,1,5,yUHkSyxqSyToZMml4S31ug

Ontama Udon: This was my first time having a chilled udon bowl and it was absolutely delicious. Smooth udon noodles in a flavorful broth and topped with a poached egg, this was perfection. 

Beverages: Their beverage machine was one of the highlights of my visit. There's so many different flavors. Peach Sprite Zero is a dream come true.

Tempura: Slim selections. There was hardly any tempura left when I visited, except for some squash and squid. My squash tempura was unfortunately cold. It didn't look like the trays were going to be refilled anytime soon as the restaurant closes at 3:00pm to prepare for dinner. 

I wanted to finish up my meal and experience at Cafe Sanuki with a taiyaki, but I was told that the ""machine broke down.""

Sanuki makes their noodles in-house so the flavor and texture will be superior to anywhere else that doesn't make it fresh.

Niku (beef) udon: Traditional udon broth with beef and onions on top. The broth is flavorful without being too salty. The beef was thinly sliced and was a little more fatty than I prefer but still not bad. 

Seafood tomato udon: A modern twist on udon, definitely my favorite between the two bowls I ordered. The udon comes in a tomato cream sauce rather than broth. The seafood was perfectly cooked. The sauce is light and pleasing without being overly acidic. Imagine a great seafood tomato-based pasta dish and replace the pasta with fresh udon noodles. 

Extras:
Soft boiled egg tempura: I enjoyed having this with the niku udon. The yolk was not too runny and the tempura batter was crunchy without being salty.
Fish cake tempura: I like fish cake and I enjoyed the texture difference of a soft fish cake center with a crunchy tempura shell. 

Lemonade: Love the flavor but beware this lemonade has dairy in it. I'm lactose-intolerant and didn't know it had dairy until I asked.",_eM7is7Mgh4qtr2GiJfviw,0,0,5,gKNJlo2nLdXhziEa6buk5A

3520223,2017-12-30,39,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Cafe Sanuki recently opened and I met with a group of friends here to try different dishes. One thing I really liked was the replica dishes they have on display for you to see what the food looks like. They also have an open kitchen so you can see the udon noodles being made fresh. Cafe Sanuki claims to make the udon with the only Yamato Udon Noodle Maker (a $40,000 machine) on the west coast. The machine makes sure every noodle is made and cut to perfection. 100% natural ingredients and authentic Sanuki Broth are used. 

Vegetarian Tomato Basil ($7.80) - The sauce with noodles had really good flavor and the mushrooms in the dish were delicious. This is the perfect dish for anyone who doesn't eat meat or fish. 

Miso Garlic Pork Belly ($3.95 for mini size) - The pork belly had great flavor and I recommend it, but my rice was one big cold clump. I was hoping for some yummy garlicky juices to be on the rice. 

Kamatama Udon ($6.45) - The udon noodles come in a bowl with freshly grated ginger and a raw egg yolk. You break the yolk and stir it in the noodles and then mix in the provided soy sauce and or condiments. I didn't expect to like this honestly and was really surprised at how much good flavor there was. 

Beef Rice ($3.95 for mini size) - The beef had good flavor, but again with a cold clump of rice. Maybe they have got some kinks to work out on the rice bowls. 

Niku ($7.45) - The beef, noodles and broth all had good flavor. I really liked the noodles here and this particular dish is perfect on a cold night. 

They have a good variety of tempura and rice rolls. The fried zucchini is huge and delicious. For drinks they have a Freestyle Machine, fresh brewed fruit teas and their own special recipe blend lemonade. The prices and portions are fair. This place is definitely worth checking out.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,67,61,4,I4R4R2JHh8rwz4u8D4s3Kg

Zaru is with cold dipping sauce which I love, however, their dipping sauce was very bland... 

Kake is with hot broth, and again, the broth was bland... super tasteless... which was very disappointing cause I wanted to taste the bonito flavor more :(

Curry Udon was just average I mean you can't go wrong with Curry... and Seafood Creamy Tomato Udon was way too garlicky and tasted just like spaghetti sauce lol. Wish they had put a little bit of a twist in it and made it more unique.

Shrimp Tempura was delicious but not Kakiage... 
Mini Pork Bowl was also good; Pork was flavored very good however the portion was too small for $3.95 and I think they use cheap rice :(

I loved the Niku Udon (Tender sliced beef on top of warm udon noodle). This was very reasonably priced at $7.45. I added an egg for an extra $1. I didn't care for the tempuras that I got as an add-ons. It wasn't as fresh.

There is one cashier and why is she also responsible for bringing bowls to tables? Perhaps the fault is in the layout of the kitchen - too many cooks bumping into each other.

3591799,2017-11-28,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"This is how Udon (and most Asian Noodles) should be served. Cafe Sanuki more closely mirrors the style of restaurant in Japan where you aren't sitting down for an hour to grab a meal that takes moments to prepare and execute and requires almost no service beyond getting your food.

Walking in, you are greeted by the open style kitchen, a display of their dishes, as well as someone making and cooking udon noodles. You walk up with a tray and order, receive your udon unless it is one that takes longer to prepare, grab tempura with plastic tongs, and choose side dishes if you like. Then you pay for your food. 

Then you grab any of the open tables and enjoy your food. When done, you simply leave your tray in a bussing area (not sure if we are supposed to clear our tray but employees seem to be cleaning up the area).

Quick, convenient, great value. And the udon is quite tasty too. I have had a chance to sample the niku, onsen tamago and the mentaiko cream udon. The beef was very tasty and tender. The tamago is imported from Japan and is organic and vegetarian, and the mentaiko cream had great flavor.

I had a chance to try the miso pork belly rice bowl as well - the pork belly was okay, but I'd definitely focus on the udon here. 

A special note about their lemonade - it's a little creamy and light in flavor which is actually pleasant because it is not overwhelmingly sweet.

One thing to watch out for might be noodle texture. The first time we went our noodles were a little overcooked and too soft. They were intensely busy with a line out the door and it was soft opening so I won't hold it against them, as the second time was better.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,3,0,5,n8_D9BpLFp9dKjFqVrazuQ

As you enter the restaurant, there's a huge glass case with all the labeled food options on display. Gotta love the instant visual upon arrival. At first, we weren't sure how everything worked (we were too busy staring at the food display). One of the staff approached us with a menu and explained: the food options are numbered, take a tray and fall in line to order and pay. Ordering is similar to places like Jason's Deli, but the kitchen is in full view to see your food being made to order. Plus everyone is engaging and friendly, even with all of our questions. Just before you pay there's a little station with tempura veggies and onigiri, ready to grab right away. After paying the drink station is close by, then you pick a table and wait for the beeper to sound off.

I ordered the nabiaki udon dish, braised pork rice bowl, salmon onigiri and pumpkin tempura. The portions are generous, and I was pleased with all the flavors. I had the pleasure of rolling my own onigiri, thank goodness it comes with instructions! The great service we received was a nice surprise. The staff walked around inquiring how the food was, and would offer to get things for you, which I haven't usually experienced in cafeteria style restaurants.

You really see how much this restaurant is trying to be as similar as possible to an actual Japanese udon restaurant. From the models of the food to the imported eggs, there is so much detail in this restaurant. I've had udon before, and this blew it all out of the water. The consistency was perfect, and the broth was amazing. 
When you walk in you see the model, and you can stay around it to see what you want. Then you go into the line. You get a tray and wait in line. You tell them what you want, and, depending on what you get, you get it immediately or you wait for a bit. While you walk forward, you choose your sides. At the end, you go to the cashier and they look at what you got. Then you sit down and enjoy your meal. I got the kitsune udon, since I saw it on a show. Really good, especially the broth. The fried tofu also had a very unique flavor. Someone else in my party got the curry udon, which had a delicious curry flavor. We also got a good selection of the tempura, and it was all good, especially the shrimp and chicken. The only complaint I had was that the asparagus was a little hard. All in all, I have to say that it was delicious and I will come back. 

I came back and tried the Yaki Udon, which was like yakisoba, which I like. The serving is huge. There are lots of cabbage chunks and bell peppers. Even though it says it has pork, it is more just bits of pork belly, not a ton of meat like the niku. Also, even though the pork shabu udon is still on the menu, they don't serve it. 

I returned and got a lot of stuff, as we had a large party. There is a new menu at the restaurant, with the pork shabu and bukakke removed. Now there is a nabeyaki udon and a House udon that is some kind of pork with a spicy miso sauce. I tried the nabeyaki, and I am glad I did. It was served in pot, and it was full of so many things. It had tempura shrimp, fish cake, beef, and an egg. The broth was also great. I got the karikage tempura as well, which was good.

We were awed by their gigantic display of all their specialties preserved behind glass. - this gives good visual on how big their dishes are and to bring out the watery mouths to try out everything. So that is what we practically did. The ordering line was very simple; grab a tray, look at the digital menu if you haven't looked at the paper menu, and then choose to your liking. Sanuki is a Japanese traditional restaurant and provide their hospitality as they would back east. Always open to offer assistance for those who have a hard time deciding what to order.

It was a good dish that sticks to the basics. I tried a fried chicken skewer--it was well seasoned, but cold. I wish they made it to order. 
The onogiri is wrapped so the seaweed doesn't come into contact with the rice until you open it, so the seaweed stays crispy. The konjack reminded me of sea cucumber--kind of a crunchy rubbery texture.

At first glance, it's a pretty restaurant with nice decorations and convincing looking pictures. The workers get a pass because it was slow and they were probably bored. Just having everyone say welcome and look at you at the same time is off-putting. The Kitsune Udon was alright and it was honestly the only reason this even got a 2nd star. If you take a look below at the pictures; the sauce cup for one of the Udon bowls have a completely solidified/fossilized noodle? Onion? Squid? Either way, it was so hard the wooden chopstick I used to pry at it broke. I hope it's just part of the cup as design. The chicken was pretty warm but doesn't seem fresh at all. I was assuming it would be a bit hotter because it's under a light but maybe the light doesn't do anything. Also it was a bit pink... But probably the biggest thing is the water. I don't know what happened here but the water smelled so bad. It smelled like fish has been sitting in it for days. The worst part is when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and mouth, the water smelled the same. Overall, fixes should be made and this place will definitely be better.",j9uv9WXob0742QncWVsN7Q,0,0,2,dwgdj1OjRpdLN-FhX-q4AQ

In my last review, I had a complaint about the customer service that I had received. 

With this visit I was very pleased with the amount of customer service I received. The guy who took my order had very good energy and he was polite. The girl who rung me up was also very polite. She was also patient with me while I pulled up my yelp check in.

The food is never a disappointment here. I had the Katsu Curry and The seasoning was spot on as always. The Katsu was definitely thicker than it used to be so I got full very fast. I love the cafeteria style of this place because I could grab whatever I wanted and since I'm sometimes in the mood for tempura this place is ideal. 

This place definitely pleased me so I will be back.

Just a little suggestion for the owners though. If you're staff had name tags it would be easier to call out the ones who should step up and praise the ones who do a great job. Just coming from a Yelpers point of view.",HH7VzcNn3jAZ0_J4Xr9JsQ,1,0,5,BWYXEBerG0EBGqDtlbcyxQ

my socks like I was hoping. The broth to me could of had more flavor like more salt or soy sauce, that to me was the only thing lacking. I ordered the #1 with a sweet potato. Also ordered a mini miso pork belly which was quite tasty. I just love the combination of pork belly and it's sauce being absorbed into the white rice underneath. This did meet expectations so I recommend ordering it as a little side dish or to share. Ambiance felt authentic and a fairly good size restaurant with amble seating. Service was also helpful and polite as I would expect for a new establishment. This place was getting kind of busy as the night progressed, which is awesome for such a new business on Spring Mtn. This is definitely going to be the new udon spot since no other restaurant in Vegas has this concept.

3877270,2018-02-11,1,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Cafe Sanuki is a great new udon spot to compete with the recent wave of udon openings in the area. This place takes udon and throws a Chipotle-style customize-your-own bowl spin to it. On top of that, the most basic styles are an affordable $5-6. You can then add toppings and side dishes such as onigiri and various tempura to your bowl for $1.75ish. 

I tried the curry beef udon with a large skewer of chicken tempura (three big pieces) and fish cake tempura. The curry was flavorful and had lots of pieces of beef. I was surprised by how well-cooked the udon noodles were. The small bowl of miso garlic pork belly on top of rice was also quite flavorful and crispy. It would've been nicer if the slices of pork belly weren't so thin. Everything came very fast and efficiently - the Japanese way. However, some udon bowls that my friends ordered did take longer to make. The beverage station has a number of different drinks including Calpico, lemonade, and a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. 

The one downside was that many of the pieces of tempura became very soggy. I enjoyed my piece of fish cake tempura as it had just come out of the frier, but everything else including the onion blossom and the chicken had that soggy texture that oozed with leftover oil as you bit into it. Still a great deal overall, especially if you can time it to get the tempura fresh.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,6,5,4,25WE0OJ4Bk2vpX_ZpKFkAg

The restaurant is big with a cafeteria style set up. You order w/ the cashier and grab any hot items that are available for purchase on the counter like different types of tempura. There's ample seating.

Food

Seafood Tomato Cream: The tomato sauce was good. The sauce came with shrimp, squid, fish and mussel. All were good except the mussel was overcooked and chewy. The udon was extremely overcooked as well. I would order this bowl again but request to hold off on the mussel and request they not overcook the udon if I came back here again. 

Carbonara Udon: Lacks flavor. Overcooked Udon again. I wouldn't order this again. 

Pork Belly Bun: This was so terrible the lady remade it for me after seeing my face when I bit into the pork belly bun. THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS! The pork belly was chewy. There wasn't any flavor. The bun was dry and hard on the outside. The new pork belly bun the server gave me was slightly better. She said sorry for how terrible the first one was because they forgot to put sauce on it. However, I will give them a pass on this because of how well they treated us. To offer to remake a dish shows they care about their customers. 

Price 

Inexpensive and probably one of the cheapest udon places in Las Vegas. 
This entire meal was $35 w/ taxes and tip. 

Service 

Excellent, which is why I would return here again because I am sure they'll follow instructions well had I expressed I wanted the mussels removed and the udon not overcooked. 

Overall, it was an okay meal. I would return again for one more try... but if that one is a bust then I will not come back again. I think a handful of visits should be enough to know if a restaurant fits your taste buds.

My review will be based upon 2 visits. 
Service: 8/10
People there are nice and usually are in a good mood. The owner is also very accommodating if ever he sees you need something. If they make a mistake, the owner will try his best to make it up to you! 
Food: 9/10
I had both the curry udon and the mentai cream udon($8.80) + miso pork mini bowl(only $2.50 additional fee instead of $3.89). 
If you want to get full, get the curry udon($6.80). It has a LOT of udon noodles and the curry sauce will make you want more. On the other hand, if you like creamy foods, the mentai cream noodles are for you! It was so good that I was smiling my whole way back home while driving after eating at this place. It wasn't fishy at all. The fish eggs they used were very creamy and not too salty. It's not like a carbonara pasta that makes you quit eating it after a few bites 'cuz of its intense creamy flavor. The taste was perfected so that you'll keep digging in. 

Can't wait to come back here again and try their other udons!

No one wants to stand in line when they go out to eat. They do advertise as cafeteria style but I feel like it's a huge disservice to their staff for tipping and their customers.

Anyways! My favorite udon place closed down.. Monson. Tear . And Sanuki has a similar menu. The food here is like a 6.5 out of 10 to me. Just at the right level to warrant eating out because you can't make it at home conveniently. 

They have a digital menu while you wait of mostly udon dishes and a couple of rice dishes. They also have some appetizers like their bao buns and their tempura station which is already made and a la carte. 

I love how they have a couple traditional Italian pasta dishes that they Japanese udon-ified like the carbonara and the seafood dish. The seafood dish had a decent amount of seafood for the price. I also really liked their curry bowl.

I had no idea the service style was like this and it's actually a lot of back and forth between the customer and the staff. Some things you order and take right away while other things get brought out to you or you go pick up.

With that aside the food is actually pretty tasty and satisfying. I couldn't give them a higher rating because nothing really warrants it.

Sanuki Service:  Upbeat friendliness was experienced at every point of contact.  Everyone behind the counter was eager to help you with any questions and the cashier was so friendly.  The crew was quick to clear the table of finished bowls and trays when you were done.  Great positive vibe here, sweet.

Sanuki cuisine: The Carbonara Udon is my #1 here. This is a dish that can go so wrong if the cream and noodles aren't quality, they do it right at Sanuki! The noodles are prepped well and was evident in all the noodle dishes I've sampled.  I added the extra braised house pork belly (because I'm extra) as a mini rice bowl option and I'm glad I did, tasty.   The Curry chicken with rice is flavorful non-udon option. Also, over sized bowls are used to serve the main dishes.  I'm not sure if it has a functional purpose, but it's great for social media posts!

Sanuki Ambiance:  I'm such a fan of the operational  design efficiencies!  1) Immediately upon entry is a glass display case showcasing the popular dishes = gets patrons ready to order once in line 
2) Menu on the monitors = Clear display of food options and easy to update on the fly 
3) Dedicated FTE/staff to take orders which: notifies kitchen staff and is uploaded to POS (point of sale) system for the cashier.  Most of the staff is in the kitchen getting the orders ready quickly and keeping the quality in check.
4) Self Service Drinks = Keeps staff focused on the food and service in the dining area (clearing tables).  Also that Calpico dispenser is awesome, I started tearing up when I saw it. lol 
The huge open dining area is attractively decorated with a Japanese Udon house style with wood everywhere.  There's a long bar for single diners and tables that accommodate parties of 6 and 4. The tables are mobile and can be moved to accommodate even larger parties.

Overall this place is such a win.  The quality of food, service for the price point is incredibly tough to beat.  I'll be back to check out more dishes and get my AYCD Calpico in, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,3,2,5,8pfNicR38yJoYwbJ3E12AQ

4108246,2018-01-14,6,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"They definitely had growing pains to deal with after a massive turnout for their opening week, but I enjoyed myself the second time on a significantly less-crowded visit.

Cafe Sanuki is the latest udon restaurant to hit Las Vegas and they're on the ""strip mall"" side of the plaza on the southeast corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur. They have a cafeteria line and manage to get both noodles and rice bowls ready quickly, and they have tempura and onigiri ready for consumption between the entree station and the register.

During my first visit, I had the Mentai cream udon ($8.80), a low/no-broth hot udon based on pollock roe. The udon was certainly creamy, but the noodles themselves were softer than I'd expected. The portion seemed a little on the small side, but perhaps that's a trick of using a bowl that's so enormous as to feel a bit unwieldy.

The second time around, I picked the Ontama Bukake udon ($6.45), which is served with broth on the side. The noodles seemed to stay just a bit more al dente without constant contact with the delicious broth (presented on the side). The egg was pretty nice, with liquid whites around that ""gelatinous"" semi-cooked yolk. The bowl was a bit less unwieldy, although it still has an odd lopsided shape.

I also had a Miso Garlic Pork Belly bowl ($3.95 mini size). It was a good side dish, but I kinda wish that the pork belly wasn't sliced so thinly. It wasn't as complex as chashu pork at various ramen places.

I also had tempura both times. I'm not 100% sure if they use the typical panko breading, but they did get a crispy texture, so I'm ok with that. The shrimp ($1.75) was pretty good, but the other one had soft rubbery texture reminiscent of improperly cooked calamari. Upon second visit, I realized that it was incorrectly labeled as chicken the first time. It probably really is calamari. I didn't try it again, instead opting for the pumpkin ($1.25), which is soft inside and reasonably crispy on the outside.

I also took advantage of the Yelp check-in offer both times for a drink (normally $2.25). I did try some of their teas and their Calpico (new on the 2nd visit), but I kept going back to their house lemonade, which is a surprisingly creamy and light take on the beverage. Fountain drinks, fruit syrups, and hot hojicha tea are also available.

I'd consider returning to Cafe Sanuki for a quick bite in the future. They're fast, and the food seems almost as delicious as more typical udon restaurants.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,11,4,l5wCO5SqIttwG1dkghuMLg

4175396,2018-01-23,2,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"My daughter & I love Cafe Sanuki! :) It reminds us of Marukame Udon in Hawaii. When we moved to Vegas from Hawaii, Marukame Udon was one of the food places we missed. So we were beyond excited when we learned Cafe Sanuki opened here in Vegas. And happy to say we were not disappointed. 

Items tried & liked (so far): 
Curry Udon
Kake Udon
Kisune Udon
Zaru Udon
Shrimp Tempura
Asparagus Tempura
Sweet Potato Tempura
Kabocha Tempura
Zucchini Tempura
Squid Tempura
Fish Cake Tempura
Kakiage
Inari
Taiyaki
Cafe Sanuki Lemonade 
Calpico Yogurt Drink (try it with a squirt or two of mango syrup) 

Noodles are cooked perfectly and broths are tasty & hot. 

In my opinion, the onigiri could use a little more seasoning.  I tried the spam (1st visit) & tuna mayo (7th visit) and both were a little bland.  It's great if you dip it into the tempura sauce. 

Restaurant is spacious & clean. Staff are always friendly & helpful :)",jp1cDthqcWX62NtL1oAKlQ,6,6,5,usLH2X-O4WAwRTMb62bEVA

Employees greeted us warmly and said it won't be open for another ten minutes but was welcome to sit and wait. While we sat there we was offered a drink. How nice of the employees to do that especially for a self serve kind of restaurant. Basically you just pick the entree and it serves fresh and you can add any additional sides. This reminds me of a place in Wakiki called Marukame Udon in Honolulu. That place is sooo so good!! Service here is better tho :).,B4BD2uMa4SMCdy0PFXR67g,0,0,5,n48Obsn1bp7x3ZG808cwVg

But the manager/owner  was yelling at employees in front of customers. Our food ended up being cold. It was also not fast. And I didn't think the price was worth the product. The udon at all you can eat sushi places taste better. The broth was bland... They told us to come back. I'll wait a while maybe it'll be better. We ended up spending almost 50$ on 3 people.

4227551,2018-04-07,1,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"I was super excited to try this place. My love for carbs and noodles is everlasting. I remember the first time I had fresh noodles in Oahu and this was fairly close. I took my cousin here and my husband had told me its cafeteria style. When you walk in there's a glass display of all their dishes in realistic form. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! From the models, you know exactly what you are getting. 

There was a line when we got there but it went fairly quickly. We ordered and went through the line. I was a bit disappointed that the tempura section was lacking. They didn't restock the items that were missing and the tempura that was left looked old. The onigri had a good selection too. We paid and I forgot to use my free drink when I checked in. 

The Udon comes out later since the make each order individually. The verdict...it was good. The noodles were a bit over cooked but I definitely preferred the tempura Udon over the tomato seafood Udon that we had gotten which the noodles were definitely over cooked. It's def big enough to bring kids (because that's something that I look for now) and noisy enough that having kids there won't ruin the ambiance. 

Overall, I like it and wished they had a place closer to the southwest. ;) service was great and I know I will be back.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,3,2,4,qTcRLyWbGEk4KcbOvY2Fzw
4236942,2018-05-22,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"I like the fact that I was completely taken back by how the restaurant actually works. At first I thought it was your regular seating by number but then the staff quickly taught me how everything works. Regular cafeteria style where you order your stuff at the counter and then pay for it. Normally I would only see this type of service through Filipino restaurants but this was a first for me with a Japanese restaurant. 

As you step in the door you get greeted by their menu. They have plastic(or I do hope its plastic) versions of what they have on their menu so you can gauge just how much the servings are per dish. I've seen these types of menu showings with plenty of japanese restaurants and I think its awesome. Because most of the time you're wondering how big the servings are for each entreé. This completely eliminates that question. All you have to do is pick and choose then order. 

At first I looked completely clueless as I did not know what to order. I wanted a regular udon bowl with broth but didn't know what the name was. The girl who took my order ended up giving me the Chef's Special which was udon covered in chili. It totally reminds me of Zha Zhiang Mien or Jajjangmyeon which is okay but I really wanted the broth one. Which was Kake Udon when I got a chance to actually look at their menu. Completely my mistake. I didn't tell them what I wanted I just kind of spewed a word and the girl tried her best to guess what it was. 

Then I ordered a rice bowl which was also confusing to the staff because they apparently have two types of pork belly bowls, the Garlic Miso, and the Braised bowl. The cashier was totally helpful with confirming what I wanted which I did get but the staff kinda judged that since I got the huge bowl of Udon that I would've settled for a mini rice bowl instead of a regular sized one. Which was okay too. I wanted a regular sized one but I guess it worked out in the end because I had room for tempura and karaage(if this doesn't tell you I'm a fatass then yes I like eating a lot). 

After the whole confusion ordering what I wanted I quickly turned my eye towards the tempura section. I immediately grabbed what's left of the fish cake tempura. They were also cranking out fresh chicken karaage at that time and I just couldn't resist. I wanted the rice balls but apparently their all fresh out of it. Which tells me I need to go here as they open. Not during the middle of the day. 

After all that then you get to the drinks station. They have the fancier soda machine with the touch screen but I'm not about sodas. They do have other drinks like lemonades and flavored iced teas but my go to was the chilled yogurt drink called Calpico. Pretty straightforward, get your drinks, your utensils and off to the races. 

The food was good. I have no recollection or base of what good Udon is but I have to say it was pretty tasty. The Chef's special indeed tasted like Zha Zhiang Mien which was a mystery at first but the. i found out that the owner was Chinese(or at least he had a Chinese name pardon my rudeness if I assumed wrong) and it kinda made sense then and there. The Miso Pork belly was so good. I came back another day to try the Braised Pork Belly but the Miso Pork Belly is where its at. I haven't tried their Gyudon but this won't be the last time I'm visiting these guys. 

The tempura. Well I can't eat shrimp but the fish cake version I had was good too. Its not a fancy restaurant so I'm not expecing anything to blow my mind but the fish cake tempuras were exactly how I imagined it to be. The chicken Karaage was kinda dry though. I was expecting a little juiciness in them but I really can't complain about it. Just wish they had an option to have a dipping sauce with a mayo base for it just to cut the dryness of the meat. 

Service wise, even if it was a cafeteria style place the cooks and the rest of the staff still ask how your food is and some even carry out conversations with you. I like that they are friendly and all but I mainly just stick to my food and eat. The cleaning part is usually you the customer bringing your tray to the collecting station. They have bins to put your dishes in but the staff urges they help youinstead of you doing it. Which is cool too. 

Overall I would say I really like the feel of the place. I might end up going back a few more times to try out everything on the menu. But I'm already starting to have favorites. Rest assured this won't be the last time you see me there. 

On a side note though I was able to try their rice balls or onigiri when I came back a later time but my take on it is it had way too much rice versus filling. It was still good but expected more filling. Not bad but it coild use improvement.",34AkcX5nFt12oE5-Sfx-Nw,1,2,4,mAEQwB6HNb1z_D9Cx_6Hyg

The Udons and the mini Miso Garlic pork belly bowl were satisfying. The onigiri, inari, and Pork bao were average. The bao needed Keupie mayo and cilantro to complement the entire sandwich.

You first order the type of dish you want, they give you a receipt, then you can choose side dishes such as Tempura (ex. Vegetable Tempura), Onigiri (Rice Ball), etc. The Cashier will total all the items together to give you your total amount. 

I ordered the Mentai Cream Udon. Mentai Cream uses Salted Alaskan Fish roe cooked in a creamy sauce mixed with the Udon Noodles. I also bought a Salmon onigiri. The packaging are normal for the onigiri in Japan. There are specific order to open the package, so make sure to read the directions located on the bottom of the onigiri. The Salmon Onigiri was salty, but the creamy sauce of the Mentai Cream goes well with the salty Salmon Onigiri.

My friends, who are locals in Vegas, recommended Cafe Sanuki for dinner on a Sunday night. It was nice and empty when we arrived at about 8pm. The restaurant is cafeteria style, so it took a while to figure out what to order and to feel comfortable enough to get in line and place our orders. 

One of the workers kindly came over and asked if we had been there before and instructed us to grab a tray, make our selection at the counter, and continue on to pick any tempura or hand rolls to add to our order. I ordered the carbonara udon with a mini order of katsu curry to share with my boyfriend. I was given a pager which beeped even before I had reached my table, and an employee brought my bowl over to me and put it on my tray. The udon was more like an alfredo than a carbonara, but delicious nonetheless. I took about a third of my meal to-go.

During our visit, I probably drank about 3 cups of their special lemonade, which we thought was a combination of lemonade and Calpico. I'm still dreaming of the beverage to this day.

4352250,2017-12-09,17,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Dang, Cafe Sanuki has me on some udon craving lately after I tried it for the first time the other day. It was so good that I went back the day after just to get my hands on some cheap udon. I went for lunch, and with half of my meal left, I was already thinking of coming back for dinner. It goes to show you how much I'm obsessed with Cafe Sanuki.

I was definitely a little confused when I first walked in, but there was a staff member who came up to us and explained how the ordering works. You order your base udon (hot, cold, with broth, without broth, carbonara, etc) and wait for them to make your udon bowl. Once you get it, you move on to the tempura area where there's 8-10 different types of tempura (shrimp, pumpkin, chicken, fish cakes, etc). Each tempura is a different price which is demarcated above the respective tempura. Grab your tempura, onigiri, etc and make your way to the register. 

I got the kamatama (udon, egg yolk, and the broth/sauce?) with scallions, ginger, shrimp tempura (2), and tempura fish cake. The udon was chewy and well cooked, and the yolk was a bright orange/yellow with a ton of flavor. The eggs really made the dish rich and added that extra dimension of flavor that made it stand out.

My favorite thing was the tempura. The batter is lightly salted, so you can actually taste the tempura. Some other places don't have a great batter so you end up with a flavorless crunch. Cafe Sanuki definitely did a great job with the tempura. It's crunchy, flavorful, and fresh!

With our Yelp check in, we got a free drink which is refillable. I got the peach tea and added some syrup sweetener from the drink area. It was pretty standard until I tried the lemonade. I'm a big fan of sweet lemonade that isn't overly sour/tart and Cafe Sanuki delivered. It's sweet but you can still taste the lemon behind all that sweetness.

Overall, it's a great udon joint that I really enjoy. It's slowly becoming my favorite udon place in Vegas. If you haven't already or are thinking of trying it out, don't hesitate and go check it out for yourself.

Food is so tasty! I ordered #2, pork belly bao, and mother ordered the clam udon bowl. Portions are plenty for its pricing, just sucks we couldn't take our leftovers since we had plans afterwards.

Staff is incredibly sweet and energetic, very welcoming from the moment we entered. Though there is no waiter service, one of the cooks still checked up on our table to see if everything was good. From my observance of about 8 or so small walk-ins that night, staff ran orders out quickly, cashier (young lady) was super sweet & helpful, and customers left happy.

The inside decor is simple, yet so dynamic because of the awesome lamps! Plenty of seating as well. 

One minor issue is the beeping of the buzzers they hand you for your food. If there are a lot of parties, beepings go off when food is ready for pick up. Again, minor issue (plus they had Seinfeld on TV so who cares).

Other than that- PLEASANT experience and am extremely happy I found this place to be part of our Vegas stay. Will come back when I can!",LikGUFRyLD5CivNinemF9A,0,0,5,QBaB3v7vz7B2jqS9iuGaYQ

Like in Hawaii, Cafe Sanuki has freshly made udon, tofu, eggs, and tempura.  Everything in Cafe Sanuki is fresh!

There is a very cool cafeteria concept and you can just peak in and see how everything is made because the kitchen is an open kitchen.  They are very clean.  I had ordered the boil egg with udon.  The boil egg is to die for in the udon!  The egg yolk is nice and soft like where you would have in Japan.  The fried chicken sewers were also sooo good and fresh! Everything in this restaurant was so good.  The lemonade is different than any other lemonade.  If you are there make sure you try the lemonade.

It was probably the best egg I've ever tasted. The owner told me it was actually shipped from Japan. Blending it with udon was a totally new experience, and I liked it a lot. Number 11 had the freshest seafood. It had shrimps, squids, fish, and oyster, and it was only $9. Totally worth it! I also tried their tempura.

- the pork belly buns only available during dinner

The food is not bad. It's good and average but don't expect 5 star quality. The servers are nice and their drinks have free refills. I didn't come during peak hours and this was my last meal before heading to the airport (which was a little unfortunate). 

Plenty of parking but can be hidden depending on where you're coming from due to the gas station right on the corner of the parking lot.

The staff.. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.
I can't even begin to desribe how ""wanted"" I felt.

Anyways at first their whole setup was a teeny bit confusing, you have to pick a tray and pick out your main dish, then you set it down at the ticket holder then you are given the option to go and pick up mini sides like Tempura, onigiri, takiyaki, etc! They give you a timer to let you know when your meal is finished!

Once they have completed your meal, you will hear a buzzer notifying you to receive your food.

Finish and pay and you are good to go!

Honestly let me tell you how spacious and nice the interior is!

Many, many tables! Along with a wall of Manga, and other things you can use!

I ordered the Miso garlic pork belly along with a mini chicken Katsu plate!

As you enter the restaurant, they have a display case of all the menu items, so you can see what you want to order. Walk around the corner and they have a menu you can lool at as well. There are trays stack up and you grab a tray and place your order. It's a bit confusing at first because I didn't know if i was supposed to wait for my noodles..no one told me anything. But within a min, they gave me my bowl of udon noodles after placing the order. There are also tempuras and chicken, where you can grab what you want. The prices for tempura range about $1.75 per piece. After you grab whatever tempura you want, you pay and then eat! The style is set up somewhat like a fast food style.

My order: Kake udon. The most simple of them all. Broth was good, hot, and refreshing. The udon noodles were cooked to perfection. Chewy texture, not overcooked or undercooked.

Shrimp tempura: i only grabbed one piece. The size of the shrimp tempura was pretty small for  the price. It was also cold as well. It was not good. 

Chicken. This was the first thing i took a bite of as soon as i sat down with my food. And unfortunately this was cold as well. They give you 2 pieces of chicken on a skewer, which would have been decent if it was hot. 

Drinks: they have calpico and sanuki lemonade!  Sanuki lemonade taste like a mix of calpico and lemonade together. It was pretty bomb! They also have syrups you can flavor your drinks as well. But I highly recommend the sanuki lemonade! 

Overall it was a good udon place minus the tempura.They need to do something about the food warming for the tempuras,  because obviously what they have is not keeping the food up to the correct temperatures per standards.

You walk in and there's this giant visual  display of their dishes, encased in glass. Very helpful I might add! It's actually quite stunning! We were waiting for a mintue to see if we would be approached but then realized we were supposed to walk up to the counter to order.
Hint! Walk towards the right and they will greet you and help you out!
We were greeted by several people behind the counter. All very friendly. I mentioned that it was our first time there and they made a thing about it to the other workers and they all said hello in their own way.
The menu is very descriptive, with pictures (also helpful). The despcriptions of the food made them all the more enticing.
There were also alacarte items, such as tempura vegetables and some other items I wasn't too familiar with. We both had tempura asparagus and pumpkin.
The tempura is under a heat lamp and already precooked. (I would have preferred is fresh but it was still tasty)
We ordered the Nabaki Udon and the Yaki Udon.
To me The Nabaki Udon has a shrimp flavored broth. It has alot of different textures and flavors going on and I think I preferred that over the Yaki Udon.
The Yaki Udon has pork belly and cabbage and it came in this gigantic bowl!!! Make sure to come with an appetite!!
There's chopsticks, forks and spoons available in a side station for anyone and self serve beverages. 
 The fresh lemonade is amazing by the way!!!
The decor is really nice and clean and they have little Bhuddas and Anime book collections and other fun stuff. I really liked it in there.
The staff is amazing and should not go left unnoticed. One of them came by our table and asked how everything was. She explained that the udon is all made fresh daily in an old school machine. The noodles seem to go for miles!!! Lol

We tell our family to ask about the food a couple minutes later to find out our food was given away to the wrong family. Upset and disappointed, we were told to wait a little longer for a fresh plate to be made. 3 minutes later, the rest of the food arrived. Truthfully, our appetites were crushed.

I blame myself for not going with their popular items, but that is why I will come back to try their more popular dishes. I got the Yaki Udon with extra noodles... not the best decision ever. Noodles were perfect, but the whole dish itself was very forgettable... so were my additions... I don't think I will ever order a thinly sliced kabocha tempura ever again for $1.25... Shrimp Tempura addition was better.  

I also don't like pictures of food that is not the proper representation of the food itself. The Tuna Mayo rice roll looks nothing like their page. The picture used on their page is hand made, not machine made (i.e. used a mold) where all the edges were perfectly straight ... The filling was also lacking flavor and moisture from the mayo.

4994980,2018-02-13,5,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Just arrived in Vegas, which was our first night, I decided to check out Café Sanuki for dinner. 

There are tons of dining options, when in Vegas and I picked Café Sanuki based on the almost 5 stars reviews, food pics, & that its been so long I had Udon soup. Another reason is that I don't want to deal with the lines back in Honolulu  at a place similar to Café Sanuki which is Marukame Udon. 

The hubby drove me down to Spring Mountain from our hotel. The parking lot was packed that night, but we were able to find a spot farther from Cafe Sanuki. Café Sanuki is located in the right corner of this strip mall. Upon entering, the café is really cool, feels like I am in Japan, with all the cute fake food display. It is cafeteria style with lots of seating. 

I thought that from reading the reviews, tips, & photos, I would be ready to order, but I still took awhile to decide. Too many choices! We placed our order and here is where my complaints begin. Our order were: Curry Udon (6.80) Kitsune Udon, (6.45) add egg (1.00) add mini curry rice (2.50) Fish cake tempura (1.75) sweet potato tempura (1.25). When I paid for my food, I didn't get the mini curry. When I asked cashier, Gabby, she asked, did you get a beeper? No beeper, did not receive one, so she said she will bring it out. 5 mins pass, 7 mins pass by, I still don't see my mini curry. I walked by the register to ask about it and Gabby said that they are prepping it, because they have to cook it. I noticed 2 other table that ordered the big bowl curry received theirs. I also see the pot of already made curry sauce. Gabby wasn't very friendly and talking back to customer isn't 5 stars in my opinion. She cannot admit that she forgot about my order. The entire time waiting for my curry my Udon soup was cold. I received my Udon soup lukewarm so the egg didn't really cook, the egg was still raw which I can't stand.

Overall, my other half enjoyed his meal. The soup wasn't too salty which is good. Cafe Sanuki is an awesome addition to Las Vegas and cheap. My visit was a disappointment. Happy that I can cross this off my bookmarks.

So I couldn't help myself and went back 2 more times. Who could pass up their 30% off pre grand opening special!?! Not me lol 

Service was good as usual. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. There was always someone running back and forth to help clear the tables and wipe them down for new customers to sit and eat. If I were to leave a suggestion it would be to have a place for us customers to help put our own dishes and throw our trash away since it is more of a self serve restaurant. I'm sure that would help the workers when the lunch and dinner rush comes through. (IKEA has these covered stalls for us to put our dirty trays with dishes in ..maybe that is something useful that may be added to this lovely place) 

Kamatama Udon - Very good! Talk about egg porn! Udon is served hot with a raw yolk on top from eggs that are imported from Japan. Chef said these were special eggs from vegetarian fed chickens. Broth/Sauce is served on the side for you to pour over your Udon. Break that yolk and let it ooze all over Udon. Enjoy!

Carbonara Udon - Good. Nice and creamy with chunks of pork belly in it. Pork belly was a little hard and chewy for my taste tho 

Curry Udon / Rice Bowl - Good. Flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary. Curry taste like the one in the yellow golden box you make at home. 

Miso Garlic Pork Belly Bowl - Very yummy. I love how super garlicky it is. Pork belly is sliced thin and packed with flavor topped with pickled ginger

Of course we ordered the Seafood Tomato Cream & Mentai Udon again. It was as delicious as the first time. 


I posted A LOT of pictures of everything we ordered and of the restaurant. If you can't see it with my post here go find them lol Everything looks and tastes delicious. You will not be disappointed.

5094982,2017-12-04,22,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"KNOCK OFF ALERT!  And it's a great thing.
 
Cafe Sanuki is a knock off of Japan's largest udon chain Marugame (for Hawaii yeeps, think our own knock off, Marukame).  

Also guessing it's Chinese and not Japanese (kunbu - Chinese on the menu vs KONBU - Japanese).  It doesn't matter as many everyday noodle shops in Japan are Chinese.  Making this place ""authentic"".  Go fig.

Machine made, glutinous and chewy, properly cooked udon.  Very basic Sanuki broth (lighter style, soy added to a simple bonito / konbu (dried fish / dried kelp) broth).  Ordered cafeteria style, pickup a few pieces of tempura and a musubi, pay and eat.  In and out in 10 minutes without making a dent in your wallet.

The kake (finished broth) and bukake (stop it, dirty minds - add your own concentrated broth) easily the best and the best value at $5.55.  Variants include adding meat (niku), egg (kamatama) and cold (zaru).  Lots of yoshoku and silly Americanized combos as well.  None sampled.  Seriously?  Seafood tomato cream udon?

Very ordinary tempura.  Excessively oily, over cooked, somewhat rubbery from having the batter over mixed.  You get what you pay for.  For between $1 - $2 all good.

Musubis also just OK.  Everyday short grain rice, typical ""fillings"" (spicy tuna, tuna with mayo, plum, spam), crisp laver surrounding it.  Over compacted but flavorful inari (cone sushi).  Again, sub $2, what do you expect.  

New, clean and friendly service.

I really liked it. I suppose next time I will just have it without the fishcakes. I had the spam onigiri as well. I liked how there was instructions on how to open it. It is cafeteria-like and people get the food fast. The person who I ordered through told me that someone will bring my dish to me when it is done but one of the staffs came to me and said my dish is ready so go pick it up myself. I thought that was strange that I was told something different than what I am supposed to do but it was okay. I think this will be a good place for anyone looking for a quick lunch.,ojMIkHP9M07O9SWOSggsRQ,0,0,4,zkJLg2DrLp_YF6_EYvxYTQ

The carbonara udon was bomb! It was not too creamy and the flavor was not too overwhelming 
The menti cream udon was very good as well enjoyed the texture of the udon it has a nice chew to it.

The Yaki udon did not have that much flavor across the board, maybe just a bad pick by me. The curry udon had good flavor in the sauce, but it did not stick to the noodles very well - thats not bad but it was more like a soup. 
They had plenty of tempura options, but were all made ahead of time and were just sitting out - they were cold and no longer crispy by the time you got to eat them. Value was pretty good however, meal for 2 under 20 bucks and free drink with a yelp checkin. Probably not a repeat destination tho. 3/5",uAJNBvcJA2kIsGx_sSofEw,0,0,3,-1GK1k_WVqQPCa2WubQsiw

I had the Kake Udon, mini Katsu curry bowl, 2 shrimp tempuras & a drink! (I know I'm a fat ass) The total was roughly $12 & I got full pretty fast. The restaurant seating area was super space but I do have to say, the only down side is the area where you pick up your food. It can be a little crowed and I know some people can't tolerate it. But besides that, it's a great environment. 

The staff is super helpful and nice! And did I mention that they serve Calpis as a drink option!? ALSO, you can add different varieties of syrups to it to taste better? My favorite, Calpis & Mango syrup. TRUST ME, YOU WONT REGRET!

If you've been to Mitsuwa plaza or Tokyo Town,  this place is nothing to rave over.  all the poor review is dead on,  noodles overcooked then udon dishes are not the stars of the show.

What pains me the most is the freshly made onigiri photos that are handmade, but if you order it, you get the Asian 7-11 rice balls. So not cool.

I wanted this place to be as good as people rated it but at the end, it's just a buncha kids who never traveled hyping it up.  I say this because on flamingo down the street from Jinya Ramen is oodle of noodle.
It's such a corny name but that place has way better udon and their mentiako cream udon is the EXACT SAME PRICE.  This place is just a cafeteria,  they should not be charging restaurant prices. 

So why not 1 star?  They are friendly and their business model seems on point.  The food is meh,  some dishes overly seasoned.  Not that it should matter but sadly it does,  no one behind the counter who is cooking is Japanese.",udSgW1BGOjP4lw9_Fsqqpg,2,0,2,qLU4A80S13IGOk2xO0RiHQ

5319752,2017-11-19,2,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"It's only the soft-opening for this restaurant and I was already impressed which doesn't always happen. My friends and I went here for a late lunch after the gym. We had our names on the guest list but there was still at least a 30-minute wait. Normally, I'd be raging from being hangry but something told me it'll be worth the wait.

They started running out of food but what I had planned on eating were still available. Yay! Despite the madness, I can't say enough good things about the owner, Henry and the kitchen staff - they were proud of their product and handled pressure with such amazing positivity, calmness and grace. They were in the flow. 

We tried a few things from the menu and we can't wait until they're officially in full operation. I'm especially excited to try their Taiyaki in the future as the ones available in this town have been major letdowns.

Carbonara Udon:
This has got to be my go-to udon. The noodles has the perfect texture. The sauce to noodle ratio was spot on. What makes their version stand out is that they use small pieces of pork belly instead of thin slices of bacon. 5/5

Niku Udon:
Noods in a hot beefy broth worthy of a big loud slurrrrrppp!!! #ilovemesomemeat 5/5

Tempura:
They have a nice variety of breaded, deep-fried artery-clogging goodness: Shrimp, Chicken, Fish Cake, sweet potato, etc. 5/5

Miso Garlic Pork Belly Rice:
Thinly sliced pork belly on a bowl of rice. The miso garlic juices mixed with the fatty pork should be enough to get you excited. 5/5

Lemonade:
I'd typically say ""when life gives you lemons, hope they're Lululemon""...this has got to be the first time I've ever liked lemonade by itself. I've given lemonade way too many chances - it's either too damn tart or diabetes-inducing sweet. Theirs was just right. Henry has every right to be proud of his version of lemonade. I was so excited to get my refill on but they were out! I wish I could do more than 5/5 but that's just a wrong rating system so, yeah, I'd settle with 5/5

My other friends tried the curry udon but we weren't about sharing today. As soon as we got our food, it was every man for himself on don't-talk-to-me-I'm-eating mode.

Henry was doing his rounds when they've pretty much sold out on everything. He was apologetic but honestly, there's nothing to be sorry for. Service, food, lemonade, price...just can't be beat! I've found my new favorite udon place.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,6,5,zPVmEvB4jdOOymVgxs_JuA
5333664,2018-01-30,11,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"When I first heard about this place was through a group of friends. My initial response was, ""Snooki from MTV Jersey Shore opened up a restaurant."" However, I quickly learned it was pronounced Café Sa-Nu-Ki, Lol. Its a Japanese restaurant with emphasis on Udon.  The ambience reminds me of Shirokiya Japanese Village at Ala Moana Shopping Center in Hawaii. Its a large food hall/beer garden with tons of Japanese food vendors. Especially the fake plastic display case in front, which is common at Japanese restaurants. 

Café Sanuki set up is a cafetaria style, where you place an order from a numbering system then your order is prepared fresh in front of you. There is side dishes like Tempura, Onigiri(Rice balls) that you can add on. There are other items that require a wait time. For those items, your given a pager and the staff will call you once its ready at the cash wrap/pick up station. 

The food is really good and very authentic to what you expect from Japanese Udon. I personally enjoy the Kamatama and Kitsune Udon and the Yaki Udon. Portions is quite filing, considering Udon is more thick than ramen. Another cool feature is that they have rice bowls in regular and mini sizes, great for sharing or if your feeling really hungry.

A few times, we had the pleasure of meeting with the owner, Henry Fan. Nice guy who is compassionate with his restaurant. He made sure our visits were good and everything was up to our satisfaction. Overall, a great place to have a meal with friends and family in a cool setting.

5349210,2017-11-21,1,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Came here this past Sunday with my husband and Andrew C. We would've went earlier but worked all week so Sunday was my only day off. We all got invited to their Pre-Opening event, which means they were generous enough to gift us with a meal. We have been waiting for Sanuki to open ever since August and boy has it been a long wait. We booked our reservation for 1200PM - 100PM. 

We got there a little bit after 1200PM and there was a line out the door. According to the associate, it was going to be a half an hour wait, which we already anticipated. One of our friends was there earlier for his 1100AM reservation and he said the kitchen was backed up. The kitchen couldn't keep up with the volume but that's also to be expected. They are in their pre-opening so they're all trying to get the hang of working in an extremely busy establishment. 

I love the layout of the restaurant. It reminds me of the udon places that I've visited in Japan and Hawaii. It's slightly different than your usual American restaurant. It runs on a cafeteria system. You grab a tray, tell them what kind of udon you want, they give that to you, then you move along to the area where all the tempura is at. You get to put whatever you want on your plate and in the end, you get rung up based on what you have on your tray. So it isn't table service so please don't complain that you had to stand and get your own food. 

As an invited guest, we were allowed one udon, one mini rice, and two tempura items. With the Yelp check in offer, we also got a free drink. Unfortunately, because we came at the later end of their pre-opening, we missed some opportunities. One of our yelp friends got to order whatever he wanted when he went on their first pre-opening date. But that is fine. I'm not a huge eater -- one bowl is enough. It just sucks when things are not consistent through the same event.

We probably chose the wrong date to go regardless because they did not have the clam udon that day, which was my first choice. Not only that but by the time we were able to order, they had ran out of egg. The eggs they used are imported from Japan so they are much cleaner and safer to eat when the yolk is raw. It's understandable that they ran out but laaaaaaame, my second choice was now out the door. I ended up going with the kitsune udon, which is sweet deep fried tofu with udon. For my mini bowl, I went with the miso garlic pork belly. As for my tempura choices, I went with the sweet potato and shrimp tempura. I also grabbed a mentai (spicy cod roe) onigiri. 

For their drinks, they have a drink station, which is pretty awesome. You get to choose between their signature lemonade, ice teas, or create your own drink in their coke machine. I ended choosing their lemonade and I'm glad I did. Their lemonade was not super diabetic sweet. It was light and a little tangy. I definitely recommend getting that. 

Their udon is okay -- it was a little more overcooked than I would've liked. I prefer a firmer texture to my udon and it is quite disappointing that Sanuki did not reach that level of firmness. Perhaps it was too busy and it messed up their mojo but one of my friends that went on Saturday said he had the same issue with the firmness. Also, their soup base was luke warm by the time I actually ate it. I don't know if their broth just isn't hot enough or they just took way too long with my order. I like my soup steaming, please.

I also got to try my friend's mentai cream udon. It was fantastic. You can tell that they use super fresh ingredients because it's not fishy at all. I've had the mentai udon at Monzo and it wasn't as good and I've had a mentai cream spaghetti at another place but it was fishy. Good job, Sanuki. Let's hope you keep that freshness level up. 

The tempura is decent as well. I just wished they had yam tempura or maybe an egg tempura. But who knows, maybe they had it and ran out. They do not refill the onigiris if they run out because they don't want to waste anything by over-making. They also like to keep things really fresh. As for the pork belly bowl -- I really wished that they cut the pork belly into pieces instead of giving me strips. I was only so-so on it. I did not even finish this but it's partially because I was too full. 

Their prices are fantastic. Out of all the udon establishments that we have in Vegas, Sanuki is probably the cheapest. Plus during their pre-opening event, you get 30% off everything!

Overall, I would definitely be back. But if they can stop overcooking their udon and give me steaming/piping hot broth then they'd be perfect (almost) all around.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,0,0,4,VDKgvdgdd-Tmbhk2sV0-bA

The house lemonade is the best I've ever had. The service is good. The owner, Henry, is dope AF! He asked us about the food and taught me a bit about the udon I was eating. He can easily become the David Chang of Udon noodles.

I had yaki udon at another restaurant a few weeks ago and I saw Cafe Sanuki had it, but there's was nothing compared to the other restaurant. It was lacking a lot of flavor. I think the tempura is a little to pricey for one piece. The tempura prices ranges from $1.25-2.00 each. The shrimp tempura had too much breading.

Most of all, I was really excited for the tempura bar!  When you enter the restaurant, you grab a tray and then you place your order from a wide selection of udon or rice bowl dishes.  They make your food upon order.  Once you get your dish, you proceed to this self serving station filled with a myriad of tempura, onigiri, and oden.  

 I love the decor of the restaurant, which does give an authentic Japanese feel, and the food display they have near the entrance (similar to the ones they have in a lot of the Japanese restaurants in LA) was a nice touch.  All the staff seemed really friendly and polite, despite a little issue we had with one of the cashier.  

Unfortunately, our experience with the food was a bit subpar.  I had ordered the kake udon with three different pieces of tempura.  The broth was good, but I wished the temperature was hotter.  It was almost lukewarm.  The udon was completely overcooked as if it had been sitting in water for a while.  It didn't have the fresh, chewy consistency as the other hand-made udon restaurants.  All three of my tempura were cold and slightly staled.  My fiance had ordered the curry rice bowl with katsu pork.  His curry came out completely cold, but the restaurant did kindly fix that for us.  The flavor of the curry was pretty good though once it was served at the correct temperature.

Overall, I think this restaurant has good potential and the prices seem pretty reasonable, so they definitely deserve another chance. But I'll probably wait a bit until they have fixed all the kinks before going back again.",dhdrwLmhr2PStk5-eTBmEw,0,0,3,h2rxEpk4FZoQyMBGwsLEvA

For the price, the food was not as good as I was expecting. The mini curry and rice tasted mediocre at best. The tempura offerings were slim at the time we went. However, there were not a lot of people in the restaurant which makes me question why they were not restocking the tempura for the next rush of people. The carbonara udon was served in an overly big bowl which was interesting presentation wise but didn't help much with taste. My girlfriend and I have had udon carbonara before and Cafe Sanuki's take on it has much to improve on. The sauce stuck to the noodles which made the dish dry after mixing and not as creamy as when the dish first arrived. There was an overabundance of cheese mixed in and as a topping which overpowered every other flavor. The amount of cheese that was served with this dish made it hard to eat. We finished all of it solely because we didn't want our money to go to waste. The only thing preventing this review from going down to two stars is the service. The staff was kind and friendly which made ordering a breeze. Most likely will not be coming back here.",gwDfm5A_ERKwP9buA5nLrA,0,0,3,grkV0iQh6_RYQlHA8qON1Q

When we heard about the soft opening deal, we decided to sign up and try their meals. At first, I thought this was going to be a sit down cafe type of restaurant; unexpectedly, however, Cafe Sanuki had a food court style type of feel since we had to go to an area to order our meals and have a seat anywhere we wanted. The restaurant was also a lot larger than we expected and could accommodate around 100 people.

For my meal, I decided to get the seafood creamy udon and two shrimp tempuras because I was craving seafood that day. For the price that the udon was set at, I definitely received a lot more noodles and seafood than I expected. At other udon places, I have paid around $13 for less food than I could get at Cafe Sanuki at $10. I liked the variety of seafood that the meal offered, and the udon had a nice chewy texture.

I am looking forward to trying their other dishes in the future because I enjoyed the amount of food and price of my meal. Thank you Cafe Sanuki for inviting me to your pre-grand opening celebration!",bArcCPuX7wLOXO-McxV76g,0,1,5,i50KnsFgl-80a6nuHGeeeA

We went for the soft opening and our meal was on the house.  We tried the carbonara udon and the curry udon by default (they ran out of the beef and tofu options). The texture of the noodles was spot on, not mushy like some other places that serve packaged udon.  The carbonara was creamy and flavorful. My 2 year old especially liked this udon.  Nothing special stood out for the curry udon, it's decent curry but not amazing.  I'm glad they did the soft opening so they can work out kinks like running out of certain dishes and organization of order numbers.  I also tried the mini garlic pork belly bowl.  The pork belly is cut thin and was a nice savory flavor with just the right amount of salt for me.  We also tried the tempura shrimp and fish cake.  Definitely try the tempura fish cake, we enjoyed it more than the shrimp surprisingly.  They also have a house made lemonade and Torani syrups to add extra flavor.  Don't forget to check in for a free drink...

5577037,2018-06-15,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"An efficient way to eat quality udon and oden. As others have said, this is a cafeteria-style restaurant where you grab a tray, order your udon, and choose whatever tempura, onigiri, and oden you want. I'm no connoisseur of Japanese food but I know what I like. I ordered the mentai cream udon, some tempura (asparagus, squash, and fish cake), and some oden options (radish and konjac). 

The mentai cream udon was served hot with a good balance of cod roe and cream that lacked any stodginess. Part of me wished I could mop up the remaining sauce at the bottom of my colossal bowl wish some bread but that would've been overkill, I guess. The quantity was perfect so that I wouldn't be weighed down by the udon and cream. All in all, a simple but somehow still fancy dish that I would get again. 

The tempura was not fresh so don't expect that piping hot, crispy goodness every time you come in. Even then, the tempura still retained some measure of crispness so it wasn't a total bust. The other thing to note is that they won't always have all the options they have labels for on the display. None of the tempura I ate retained any taste; if I closed my eyes, I would only distinguish each of my options by texture and form. All in all, you'd be fine if you skipped this. 

Finally, the oden. This was my first time trying oden. You can choose whatever you want and they'll serve it all up in a bowl with some of the broth. The interesting thing about oden is that the broth tastes like whatever has been steeping in it. This can mean that it retains the flavor of whatever people don't want as much of. Anyways, the broth had some pretty good depth: strong radish flavor with a bit of the flavors of the other oden options in the background. This gave the broth a ""healthy"" or almost medicinal taste that I didn't dislike. The radish was great because your spoon would just slide into it and it more or less melted in my mouth. The konjac didn't taste like much (which is to be expected, I think) but was a great contrast in color and texture to the radish with a bounciness that is like the stiffest savory jello you can imagine. I'm grateful I could try oden in such a casual setting. 

As for the ambience, it's spacious with good light and airflow. The decoration is quaint. It gets the job done. The actual dishes (bowls, etc.) and trays are very attractive to look at and make great Instagram pictures, I would imagine. It's really strange (but probably cheaper) to have plastic cups and ""silverware"" with such nice looking dishes. But that's just me nitpicking. 

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it would be a good option if I wanted a good, quick meal while I was in the area.",bR62JZ28HUfYGhTN4Hl4IA,0,0,4,ejltQnoPt-lIph91j9J8pA

When you first enter the restaurant, you're greeted with a nice display case filled with vibrant-colored appetizing-looking food models and prices. The food service is also incredibly fast. It's cafeteria style so you grab a tray and order what you want. In this case ontama udon and miso garlic pork belly ($7.95 each). Then as you go down the line, there's various tempura and rice rolls varying in prices. For example a single shrimp tempura was about $1.25. Our total was about $25 and the portions were filling. Also if you're a first time visitor, they'll give you complimentary soup to wash everything down. The food was delicious and for the price you pay, you can't beat that.

This is cafeteria style.
You first order what noodle dish you would like. Both times i had gotten #1 kake udon. A small side of the pork belly rice. While waiting for my udon and rice i had to slide right through to the tempura.
The udon is soooo flavorful, super long and cooked just right where it's not to chewy and not not chewy. The broth is comforting. The pork belly is cooked well enough where it's tender not chewy you can tell this place really cares for
The quality of product they carry. 
I knew i was going to get the small side of pork belly ehh i didn't want any meat in my udon but if i wasn't going to get the side of rice i would've ended up with Kamamata udon.

Tempura:
Pumpkin
Potato 
Shrimp 
Zucchini 
Most importantly the SOFT EGG

They also have chicken karage 
And rice balls stuffed with yumminess on the inside  wrapped with crunchy seaweed on the outside. 

Onigiri
They have six different flavors ^^


And to wash down all the dry stuff because you slurped all your udon and broth in the first 30 seconds of sitting down they have ""drum roll"" CALPICO on tap. That is Asian childhood heaven.

The food itself was really good. The tomato cream with seafood offered a decent amount of seafood, more than I would have expected at the price. The wide array of tempura left my table craving more and by the end of the meal everyone's bowls were scraped clean.

5763593,2017-12-18,3,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Came here for lunch and had really high hopes. I've been to a few Japanese cafeteria style udon places including Hawaii, West Los Angeles and Japan. 

First off, I was bummed out that they didn't serve chicken Katsu (only pork) and the curry had beef in it. I don't eat pork or beef. Ended up with the number one with two shrimp tempura and a cone sushi. Udon was standard and made to order, shrimp tempera was cold and on the small side and the cone sushi even smaller and I wasn't a fan of what little flavor in the rice seasoning. Not to sure how long the tempura was sitting there. Not much tempura options. 

Check out took longer since the kitchen combined our order which needed to be separated at the register. 

I'm giving this place 2 stars for trying and having lots of seating. Wish the shrimp and cone sushi was a little bigger for the price and the seasoning needs work. It would be nice to have chicken katsu if you have chicken tempura instead of only having pork katsu. Also... no beef in the curry. First time coming across beef in curry in a katsu/curry. I ate everything I ordered and still left hungry. 

I rather go back to the cafeteria style udon spot in my neighborhood in West LA that is fairly new too. Much better experience. 

Theres other gems in Chinatown that I rather spend money on in Las Vegas. 
If you haven't been to this type of eatery before you'll probably enjoy the experience of cafeteria style. But I've been to a handful so I was hoping for a better experience.

5786547,2017-11-18,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"I went to the soft opening of this restaurant. When we got there the line was a bit long but that's usually a good 
sign.  After about a 20 min wait we were next to order. It's kind of like the cafeteria style where you wait in line, place your order and they give you a number. Then you continue in the line where you can pick sides of tempura or  onigiri. I ordered the carbonara and a mini curry, as well as a shrimp tempura and a ball of mixed veggie tempura. 

Pros: 3 out of 4 of our dishes came out pretty fast. Food was hot and was pretty good. Carbonara was saucy but a little plain. Literally just noodles and sauce.  The onigiri was pretty good. The tempura was nothing fancy. Prefer to skip out on it next time. 

Cons: (I understand this was a soft opening so I am still leaving four stars) our fourth dish (clam udon) did not come out for 20 min. We waited and waited and saw many others that had ordered after us get their clam udon. We waved down multiple servers and told them but they would brush it off without even checking that ""it's coming"" ""it takes a while"" 
The rest of us all finished our meal and our fourth person still did not receive her udon. I work in a restaurant too and I know and understand that when it's busy, we all make mistakes and forget orders, or something happens in the kitchen. Just an honest ""let me go check for you, their might have been a mistake or forgot to put the order in I'm sorry"" would make everything so much better. 25 min later we finally got the clam udon.  If you plan on ordering the clam udon, be prepared to wait!!  
Also, they have one fountain drink machine in the whole place. It's not the regular ones with all the diff sodas you can pour from, but the single serving touch screen ones where only one person can pour from at a time. 
I understand that soft openings are good because they hear about customers Inputs and change and fix things up! So here is my soft opening input!",Qi2Sp3o4_xU9TEiGff7Eqw,0,0,4,ZqKV-YosEJPOxGlQS6JPgQ

WoW! What a TREASURE!

You know it's good when there's Japanese people eating there, yet it's VERY ""American Friendly"" which is something that most Asian restaurants aren't.

What I mean is that you'll feel very comfortable ordering food here even if you have no clue about Japanese food. When you walk in there's a huge glass display featuring replicas of their most popular products. There are also well crafted booklets available which show and explain each item. There's also video monitors that show the various offerings as well.

You won't have to 'guess' what each item is. It's very well shown and explained.

Their specialty is Udon, which is a soup featuring thick noodles. There are many varieties, mixed with different items such as veggies, eggs, and meat. Rice bowls are also a tempting offering, and there are sides including, but not limited to various tempura and seaweed wraps ('sushi'... sort of).

It's served cafeteria style, meaning you line up with a tray and order. After paying you bring your food to a table.

They also have an outstanding selection of soft drinks including an unusual one called Calipo. If you're adventurous but don't like the idea of ordering a drink that you don't know if you'll like, this is a great place to try it out because the drinks are bottomless and self serve. Free drink with Yelp check in, too!

----------
Personal pet peeve rant: Please do not pronounce UDON like Ming Tsai (for an Asian guy that lived and worked in Japan before becoming a TV chef, it is disrespectful to purposely mispronounce a common Japanese noodle dish that he probably ate numerous times after work.  He is not some guy that might have lived their entire life having never traveled more than 30 miles in any one direction on a farm in Ohio. Udon is not pronounced U-Don.
Don't trust the pronunciation provided by the US-based search engines either.  Search Youtube for ""??? pronounciation"" for the Japanese pronunciation. Or just ask the staff that works at Café Sanuki.
----------

The display of life like menu items made of plastic in the glass display definitely reminded me of the Japanese restaurants my parents took me to when I was growing up in Taiwan and visited on vacations in Japan, S.Korea and even Thailand.  It is not as common nowadays, especially in Nevada, probably due to the cost of these boarder line works of art. But having a visual representation of what you can expect to receive before ordering is nearly priceless. Plus photos, even really really good ones, can only do so much.  Bonus points for that authenticity feel!

So after I verified that I was at the right address, by stepping back into the parking lot to double check the signage on the outside of the building, I was immediately greeted by two lovely hostesses with a clipboard to check in.  I was given a laminated voucher to redeem at the cashier, and suggested to check out the fresh udon being prepared by a machine right on the other side of the glass partition.  The machine is a sheeter, that rolls the dough into the desired thickness, and then feed through the machine to be cut into individual thick strips of udon noodles.  After it is cut, the udon is dusted with some type of flour (guessing wheat flour) to keep it from sticking together, and toss into boiling water to cook for just a brief period of time.  Very simple process.

The tricky part is deciding what to order in this cafeteria-style udon-bar restaurant. Just looking at their menu, they appear to have at least 16 Udon preparations to satisfy your need for udon noods. Plus 4 options of Rice Bowls (Options: Beef, Curry, Chicken & Egg, and Miso Garlic Pork Belly in regular and mini size options). After placing your udon orders, there are also tempura-fried appetizers that can be selected to compliment your udon entrée.  Plus they have 8 different Onigiri (Japanese Rice Balls with different fillings: Spicy Tuna, Tuna Mayo, Salmon, Spam, Mentai, Plum, Kunbu, and Inari), and in the near future Oden selections and Taiyaki (a type of dessert in the shape of a baked fish (sea bream) cake with traditionally filled with Japanese red bean paste filling.

What I ended up ordering are #11 Seafood Tomato Cream and #12 Mentai Cream Udon.  Both of these udon entrees are served in oversized bowls (large enough to fit probably the Costco pack of 2 watermelons or a basketball), which then made the udon portions look deceptively tiny. Plus one of the hostess also asked if I wanted to try a mini Rice Bowl, which I could not refused. And while waiting to get to the cashier, I also picked up a single tempura-fried shrimp (pretty good and the shrimp is not the tiny pinky-sized shrimps often served at the lower-end Japanese or AYCE sushi restaurants) on a tray next to the other tempura-fried appetizers and Japanese ""fritters"" often served on the side to compliment the udon noodles.

Overall, I thought the price range is reasonable ($5.50 to $9.95), even without the soft opening 30% off discount, and the selection of udon noodles toppings and preparation are pretty extensive.  Plus there is the option to serve some of the udon entrees cold instead of hot, just like in Japan and numerous iconic dishes from around the globe during the summer or winter (e.g., Vichyssoise, aka Potato Leek Soup).  The biggest appeal, besides the convenient location (Decatur and Spring Mountain), is that it is a fast, relatively healthy meal on a short lunch break or for dinner after a long day at work.

Also they have one of those fancy Coke Freestyle Soda Machines with the touch sensitive monitor that you can navigate to dispense up to 144 different beverages. Plus they also have 5 flavors of fresh brew Harney & Sons fruit teas and 8 different syrups to further customize your drinks.  But I totally recommend not trying any of that, especially the sodas, until you have tried Café Sanuki's House Blend Lemonade (it is not too sweet, have a pleasant citrus note that I can not quite place).

Give them a try, before Café Sanuki gets too popular and the wait is long.

5954723,2018-06-14,0,e3PBfbtXUjMziX6XGsOMoA,"Went to Cafe Sanuki friday 6/1 at 1pm.  First time there, so always unsure of how it was going to go.  But here is my overall impression (very detailed review).

When you enter into the restaurant you are greeted by a glass case with the plastic food models.  Very nice feature to help you decide what you want.  However,  several of the models were completely different from what was on the menu.  A #20 in the glass case was chicken with egg rice bowl, while the menu #20 is the pork belly bowl.  This caused us some confusion with picking our items as we were not sure what was correct.  We had been online checking the place out, so thought we had an idea of what was offered.....case threw us off. 

So we get in line and as many prior reviews state, it is cafeteria style.  So you grab a tray and slowly slide your way down the line giving your order to one person, while another makes it (this was where our order fell apart), pick some sides if you want (choose from tempura, onigiri or oden), then get rung up at the end by the cashier.  If you happen to get your order immediately after it is made and before you have to pay you then, very carefully, walk your way to one of the many tables (praying you don't spill or slosh any of the precious liquid in your bowl on the way).  Otherwise you get one of those light up, vibrating coaster deals and have to go back up to the main counter when it starts flashing (not exactly convenient), or if you are lucky it will be brought out to you.

As I stated up above, our order went off the rails between telling one person what we wanted and the other person making it.  Unfortunately, the person making the order was not paying attention and we kept having to repeat what we did, or did not want/ordered.  My mom ordered the Kake Udon with no tempura crumbles which they got correct, plus a bottle of the cold bukakke sauce that was not part of her order.  My dad ordered the braised house pork rice bowl with no ginger, and ended up with a huge pile of the pink pickled stuff despite all three of us saying no ginger repeatedly.  I ordered the Ontama Udon.  The person making it kept trying to put ingredients into the bowl that didn't belong.  Almost as if he was making a combination of the Kake, Nabiake and Ontama Udon.  I finally got him to understand that only warm noodles and an onsen tomago were supposed to be in the bowl (then he threw on a bunch of green onion.....I just shook my head).  Then he gave me a miso soup size bowl of broth with more green onions and tempura flakes.  When I said that wasn't the right broth, he insisted it was, and I did not get the plate of grated ginger or green onion (which he also said I did not get, but is what is pictured in the menu and plastic display).  No one else was there who could say otherwise, so I was stuck with that broth and my parents had already been rung up by then and the cashier had stepped away.

Get to our table and start eating.  Turns out that the broth I was given was the same broth as the Kake Udon.  We were checked on by one of the workers (more of a drive by kind of check...almost as if they just expected us to smile and nod, not ask a question), and when we asked if I had the right broth, the worker did not even look and just said, ""yeah that's right,"" then walked away.  What makes this upsetting is that I saw at least three other people order Ontama Udon, and they got the correct broth and ginger/onion plate.

My dad liked his braised pork, the Kake Udon was good but the broth was very fishy, and I can't really say how the Ontama was as they only got it partly right.  I tasted the cold bukakke broth, and that was good.....so if the Ontama would have had the hot bukakke broth and grated ginger/green onions like it was supposed to, it would have been great.

I really wanted to like it, since I love udon and my other go to closed.  But for now it is a meh.  I will give it one more try, since it may have just been poor service.  I hope they get it right this next time.",rP3ITMI1jvv60_982muq2w,0,0,3,vwvL7NOLBljZzL4z4Q5GLw

No need to wait to be seated.  #1 udon was basic and a great introduction.  It wasnt too heavy. The pork bao was reasonably good.  The tempura selection was fine.  Parking was a breeze unlike other centers in area. 
Staff was friendly and efficient.  I'll be back.",4_h5AwPKPkv3J9CL7E5x2w,0,0,5,FfKyP5FUXBmaSi8YcpZ6FQ
