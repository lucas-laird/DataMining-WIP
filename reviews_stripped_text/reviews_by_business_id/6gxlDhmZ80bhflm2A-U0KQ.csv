Homeless people hanging out outside asking for money. The egg in my croissantwhich was undercooked. They need to take care of their landscaping ASAP. The bushes in front of the drive thru speaker are overgrown and overrun with bees. Next time I'll make the drive down to BK on Charleston and Lamb as they have recently remodeled and improved on their service. Hope they work on this location soon because the staff is actually pretty nice.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,2,1,2,dBUwzJqQwedwxn583C6efw

When I got there, my card was saying that it was invalid. The cashier made a mistake and rung me up as if I paid 100$ cash and had to re-do the entire order. My card was still invalid. I left to call my card and was told that they would save my order until I came back. I found out that my card had a hold on it for fraud detection. It took almost 30 minutes to get it taken care of and walk back to BK before they stopped serving breakfast. When I got there, they were no longer serving breakfast but still had me a fresh order of croissantwiches. I am extremely satisfied. Because I would have been depressed until I finally fulfilled that craving. Everyone was extremely courteous and even though they had system issues, and my card had issues, they still did everything in their power to satisfy a customer. Plus I did not disclose with them that I was pregnant, so I didn't receive any special treatment because of it. GO BK MORNING SHIFT.",iiwu_RRu_YMQIfn03I-wdQ,0,0,5,JlrGieveHfka1x_yqyDjtw
