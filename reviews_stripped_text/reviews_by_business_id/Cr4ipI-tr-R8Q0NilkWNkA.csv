We only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)

The drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.",wcKvC0jov-kAHg-GIvWJqg,1,0,4,W5Y3_9iKXLo-iSiqXFfnCw

After the conference ended for the day, I managed to squeeze in some time to check it out before dinner time at another locale. It was empty at 6pm although some folks were enjoying their drinks! By golly, the view is fantastic! It is definitely at par with that of Aqua in Hong Kong, wide open view beyond miles of the strip and the surrounding desert! 
I have to return on a regular night to experience the action but the view and the setup and the semi open-air lounge area is killer! 

The women's bathrooms each opened up to the view below! I hope it's one way mirrors but you can go about your business and enjoy the view outside! Will post photos soon!

31706,2010-10-26,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Here's the thing about mix:  The food was some of the best we've ever had.  However, the management was hands down the worst experience I've had in Vegas, probably anywhere.  We made reservations through the Mandalay Bay website, and were sent a confirmation a week in advance.  When we arrived for dinner, we were told they ""couldn't find"" our reservation, and that the confirmation number we were sent was useless because they only searched them by name.  (WHY HAVE ONE THEN??)  I went upstairs to speak to the manager, and realized what had happened as we watched them turn others away.  They had sold out the dining room, thereby negating all of our reservations, and then had the gall to tell us it was somehow our fault for not booking right, or that it was computer error.  They finally relented to us staying, but only if we could be ""out before the party arrived,"" effectively putting us on the clock at a hundred dollar a head restaurant.  Unacceptable. 

That said, the Pepercorn Filet was the best I've ever had.  Whomever is charged with steaks in this kitchen knows his stuff.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly tender.  My companion's Lobster curry was delicious as well.  And our server, D, was lovely and gracious and accommodating.

The Delano hotel is stunning. It was our first time seeing it. You take a very scenic elevator ride up to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a dark, sexy lounge at the entrance. We walked by a very large and CLEAN kitchen (where the magic happens). The dining room is large and modern. But we were sat in the patio. OMG the view is UNREAL! You can see the end side of Luxor and the entire lit up Vegas Strip! The most romantic table in las vegas and we were sitting at it!
The rest of the experience matched the beauty of the view. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable giving us great recommendations and really making us feel special. We had the borabora (a cocktail that takes your tastebuds on vacation!) and did the tasting menu with wine pairings. All the food and wine paired wonderfully. The vegetable salad was delicious and light. The gnocchi was so light and fluffy, perfect little potato pillows. I had the bison and my boyfriend got the filet. Both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection and tasted so good with all the components on the plate. We were brought out a pre dessert in a martini glass. A little sip of coconut heaven!!! The housemade sorbets are a must! I got the exotic sorbet and it was the perfect finish to an amazing meal!

I heard nothing but good things about Mix. So when we were going to Magic, I knew I had to make our team dinner at Mix. Their view is incredible, the restaurant is cute/modern, and it's definitely trendy. 

The one thing that I have to complain about is the service. It's GOD AWFUL. They are so slow I can't stand it. We waited over an hour for our food to come out. My boss complained to the manager, and they just comped a bottle of wine, without very much regard or apology. For a Michelin Rated restaurant, this is a big no no. The waiter didn't even acknowledge that our food was going to be late, or offer any explanation as to why it took so long. 

Ok, now that I got my rant aside, I'll move onto the food/drinks

I stuck to the skinny girl margaritas, and they were just ok. It wasn't mixed very well (alcohol was at the way bottom), and it wasn't something I wanted to devour immediately. 

For appetizers, we got the  macaroni and cheese with ham and lobster casesar salad. The salad was fresh, and tasty. The mac and cheese? Not so much. It was runny, and just not good. No cheesy goodness there. You can skip that.

For entrees, I got he pepper crusted bison tenderloin with glazed vegetables and black pepper sauce. The meat was cooked very well, medium rare, super soft, but that pepper crusted part was so peppery that it was overpowering. All I could taste was the pepper, and it definitely took away from the entree. As for sides, we got the creamy spinach and the fork crushed potatoes. Sides were good, but nothing to die over. 

At this point, our meal was getting to be so long I wanted it to be over (we were approaching hour 3). But they gave us homemade madelines and chocolate, and this passion fruit ""drink"" served in a martini glass with foam. Just too much dessert that I didn't even want. We quickly tried that, and asked for the bill. My boss paid for it, so I can't tell you exactly how much it was, but 6 people was about $500.",kg8tWKYrB9I6VThlxTaD-A,6,1,2,6cD0Wmj3webjxxKvqZr1iA

First off, the host was rather unfriendly as he guided us to our table.  Our waitress seemed too busy to give us attention, although we did see her chatting with other staff members.  When we tried to order a sampler dish, she told us that my wife and I BOTH had to order the dish or else we couldn't have it.  Later on, our friends told us that they were able to order the sampler dish without a problem.

I ordered the sea bass and my wife ordered the halibut.  For 38 and 48 dollars respectively, both fish were slightly overcooked although the flavors were okay.  We are not big eaters, but the filets were so small, there weren't many vegetables (we had to order an additional side of asparagus) and even after dessert and almost 200 dollars later, we were still hungry after our meh dishes.

When we were done, our waitress walked by and dropped the check on our table before we asked for it.  Only after she inspected the generous tip that we still left her did she look up at us and say thank you.  

The quality of the dishes were on par with the buffet at Bellagio.  We would be more than happy to pay for food that's made with attention and flavor, and served with politeness.  However, after this experience, we will not go to Mix again.",j6b3ZuMx1GEem8EhDAdiuw,0,0,1,ykTwf-paJBoJwj6INxa8Kg

Food was tasty amd the food runner was describing every item as it arrived and kept our water full. The server made sure our champagne was full as well. View was epic. Drinks came quickly. Tje place is pretty cool looking also.

Cons
We waited at the host desk for 2 to 3 minutes while people looked at us but no one helped us. The restaurant was completely empty. We finally got a table outside and it was wonderful. The second downside was that our server was less than communicative. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there and acted very monotone.

The view was absolutely gorgeous- so the 4 star stellar review is really for the view more so than any other part. My friends and I dropped by to Mix after experiencing the Ice Bar located in Mandalay Bay. When we got there it was already close to 1am, and they close at 2am. Which, would have been fine, but they wanted to charge us a cover for going in- Thankfully, some of the girls in our group negotiated, but really, it's a bit ridiculous to charge cover at 1am when you close at 2. So a star off for that.

92881,2010-02-16,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I'm a little torn with this place.   How does one boil your thoughts about a place down to 1-5 stars?  What I've found is that the most memorable things about a place will drive the stars up if they were great, even if overall the place wasn't that superb.  

In the case of MIX, the stars might have been driven higher than the 3 I gave it, if I had followed this method... because the dramatic ceiling installation (see pictures) and the 5***** appetizers were amazing!  But the main courses were underwhelming all around the table and the service was lackluster.  Add it all up, and then remember the outrageous prices, and a 4-5 star review quickly gets knocked down to a 3.  

First the good...
The installation and decor as a whole... well, not much more to say than it made an impression.  But even with decor, I felt that the all white and mother-of-pearl layout got lazy after the drama of the ceiling, especially when they underachieved on taking advantage of the spectacular view of the strip it could have.  But decor is decor...

The food...
Like I said, the apps were top notch.  The foie gras and sashimi apps were amazing, as were the others.  However, the main courses took a nose-dive.  Maybe this was because were were there around 10-11pm, their last seatings at the end of the night... but this is Vegas?!  Where midnight is like 3pm.  Plus charge what they do and it better blow my mind. It didn't.

131477,2012-06-23,2,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I was invited here by some colleagues during a work retreat and treated to an extravagant place with over-the-top prices on food. There were many areas to MIX that ran the gamut of styles. First of all, the entrance to MIX was just a hallway to an outdoor elevator that shot up to the top of the hotel; by the way, it was hot! 

Once we got in, there was the lounge and bar area which were club-like and very loud. Vegas, yes yes. We apparently were in the back past the kitchen so we moved from that very dark, very loud setting to a white bubbly restaurant area. Talk about modernized fancy schmancy - even our bread came with square pats of creamy butter and sweet peanut butter. By the way, the pimento bread was very excellent and good on its own without any spread. 

So after trying to get a little comfortable in this unfamiliar setting of a swanky restaurant (and staring at the price tags on the food), I decided that since I was already in the situation, I ought to take full advantage of it. I mean, when else am I going to place myself there with a high-priced menu? Therefore, what else to order but one of the chef's signature dishes, the filet mignon rossini? It came with seared foie gras and sliced black truffles. Oh and I believe there was also a side of mashed potatoes for me too. When they came out, they honestly weren't presented in a way that made my mouth water (actually, the waiter set the plate down in front of me incorrectly with the insignia not turned properly). However, the tenderness of the steak certainly played its part in charming me. Was the best I've had though? No but the seared foie gras really helped pull the flavors together. Let's not forget the truffle! The mashed potatoes were also both fluffy and still chunky enough to please my palate. Now, was the whole entree worth $69? I'd say not. Was it delicious and juicy? Yes it sure was.

I couldn't resist getting dessert with such wonderful descriptions listed on the menu (turn a blind eye to the price tag, Minerva!). I ended up with a hazelnut souffle paired with grapefruit sorbet. Uh, who pairs the two together? I was hoping that I'd get them in some kind of complex mix but alas, they were presented separately on one plate. The hazelnut souffle had too much sugar in some parts so that it was unnecessarily cavity-inducing crunchy. I really enjoyed the sorbet but felt that it was odd to include the bits of sugar in the bowl. The candied grapefruit peel was delicious but again, too sweet. I'm glad I had the experience here but once again was proven correct in my thought that the cost and high profile appearance of a place does not say anything about the food.

We only chose to go here because of the Michelin star and always wanted to try a Michelin-starred restaurant.  But no clue how it got one.

Food:
- Appetizers: We ordered several different ones and thought they were all amazing
- Entrees: most of us ordered a $75 filet + fois gras + truffle special.  The filet had absolutely no flavor.  You can see the large slice of fois gras & truffle on top, but neither had the distinct taste/flavor you would expect from such ingredients.  With those ingredients, it was so disappointing that it was so flavorless.
- Sides: We had a couple orders of mac & cheese and veggies, and they were all good
- Dessert:  Decent

Service: So annoying.  I don't know if just assumed that a group of guys meant we were on a bachelor party or something, but we weren't college kids on spring break or anything.

There were also a few misses (one wine was WAY too sweet for me to have more than a sip of and I could have done without the port at the end), but overall this meal was a winner. Is it worth the hefty price tag? Not on every trip to Vegas, but since it was our anniversary (and my husband had been lucky at the roulette table) it was so worth it. Will definitely return to the lounge in the future. Who could pass up a dance floor with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip?",eV4yo91tBraQMAVrUWZYCQ,1,1,4,oWQVXgRBprKWaJ6k81VhUQ

The drinks were awful - no creativity at all, especially for an $18 martini. 
The food was barely edible. I ordered the white bean soup which was bland. The egg roll that accompanied it was so greasy and I couldn't taste the veggies inside. My husband's filet was undercooked. The gnocchi was mushy and tasteless. We opted out of dessert. They gave us a little freebie which was a homemade Madeline with Nutella dipping sauce. Not exciting or gourmet at all.

The view: awesome. 5 stars. Very few places in Vegas can give you this all-encompassing view (the only thing that screws it up a bit is the City Center blocking the Bellagio).

The drinks: expensive but tasty. We came here for the company, view and ambience, not the drinks. With that said, the drinks were tasty but both my wife and I are too cheap to buy more than 1 each (which we felt like would be the minimum). 

The scene: we came on a Tuesday evening knowing that it would be empty and quiet (which is what we wanted - we're getting old!) And I believe this enhanced the view and the experience. 

I can imagine this place getting really dense/tight/crowded on the weekend (I would probably stay away). But if we're in Vegas mid-week, we would probably come again.",FWmqs6tgPuzKdrrweKBIrA,2,0,4,HMuuL3gW5IgiDrYPLSLjEA

I am quick to judge an upscale restaurant on a simple rule: do they offer you a dark or light napkin depending upon your attire?  I was wearing a black dress.  Everything is white at MIX.  No offer of a black napkin.  Okay- that is my little hang up, but usually it is not a deal breaker.

We were seated in a lovely corner seat, but before we had ordered our wine, the hostess seated another party directly next to us (the tables were tight in and had to be moved to seat anyone in or out - so when I say 'next to', I mean literally 'on top of').  If it were a busy night, that would have been fine, but there were only a handful of tables occupied.  In fact, we were so close that when the palate cleanser came out - the waitress made a joke and served both our table and our unexpected dinner partners' together as if we were in the same party.

The servers were nice- but my plate was taken before I was done with my meal and water spots on our flatware were pointed out to us (seriously) and explained why they weren't dirty, it was just a chemical-reaction-but-here-is-a-new-spoon-anyway-even-though-you-didn't-ask.  Who knew there was flatware TMI?

The food was decent.  Our highlight was a phenomenal bottle of wine (very extensive wine list) and the ravioli appetizer - out of this world.  Our entrees?  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.

We went to MIX for a romantic Vegas evening.  It was definitely Vegas- but Vegas in the 'pot-bellied-balding-Elvis-impersonator' sort of way.  I wouldn't complain if it were my only Elvis sighting- but you know it doesn't live up to what is around every other corner.

200523,2010-06-17,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I really wanted to like this place.  I had high expectations after reading some of the yelp reviews.  However, I left a bit disappointed and unsatisfied.  It is a beautiful restaurant with ultra chic decor.  The winding staircase and hanging glass balls are a nice touch.  I originally wanted to give it a 3, but the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a lower review.  

First of all, my BF and I were seated at the opposite end of where we wanted to sit (the side facing the strip).  We got bread with two kinds of butter.  Regular and peanut butter butter.  I didn't really like the peanut butter butter very much.  And the bread was difficult to cut.  I like it when they give you bread that's already cut up so all you have to do is tear it off from the bread bowl.  Especially when you're sharing with a group of people.  Who wants to eat it after someone grabs it with their hands and cuts it up. 

I wasn't very hungry so decided to not do the prixe fixe meal and instead decided to get 2 appetizers and a salad for my entree.  We got the foie gras and tuna tartare to start.  It was good, but I've definitely had better.   My $20 appetizer salad was light and refreshing but still left me unsatisfied.  My BF got the lobster with rice and I must say that it was delicious.  For $50, it better be!  

The wine: we opted to share a bottle of Pinot Grigio.  The wine guy, likely not a master sommelier barely said a word.  My BF tried the wine and he approved and said would you like to try it? The guy starts pouring me a full glass.  I guess we are getting this bottle whether I like it or not.  

The service:   Umm service was not great.  Just mediocre.  Our waiter was nice and took some pics for us but the host was not so friendly.  We had a restaurant.com gift certificate but didn't print it out and asked if we could still use it.  It was in email format and my BF pulled it up on his phone.  At first they said that it was fine and later French host dude with an attitude came back and said sorry our mistake, that was for someone else.  But said that we would get something complimentary from the chef.  I was excited, yay! free stuff.  They brought out this drink in a martini glass.  French dude said, it's non-alcoholic because ""I'm not sure if you're 21.""  I don't know whether he was trying to be funny or not, because clearly I was drinking wine all night already and was still sipping on my last glass when he came.  So I decided to try it.  It was not good.  Then I looked over the other tables and saw that people got the same thing.  It could be that they may very well have ordered that.  Or the chef was just giving those away to everybody that night.  

Overall, food was pretty good, but for the price, I also expect stellar service.  This restaurant did not meet my expectations.",P3ivoE4zRiv409YRz61IzA,2,0,2,x59__-97yckpK7UFhGkAWg

In the pretense of celebrating a birthday/anniversary, we went to the top of theHotel at Mandalay Bay to have dinner at MIX; it was a fantastic decision!  The ambiance was perfect for the evening with balcony seating with the cool evening air venturing in.

The food, although on the pricey side, was exquisite.  I had the braised wagyu which was tender and flavorful as can be!

Our server, Randy, was superb!  He was very knowledgeable of the menu and his charisma definitely added to the evening.  The service even brought out fresh madeleines decorated for our special occasion.

Well it sure was trendy with it's completely white interior and all white plush booths but there was nothing nice about the service.  It started off fairly well; we made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  

I ordered the sea scallops and I remember there were only four.  Eh, not unexpected so I decided to take my sweet time with them.  If I'm paying $30+ for four scallops I'm going to relish every bite!  Well I only finished two of them when my plate was whisked away from me.   Just scooped away with my fork in hand looking in disbelief at the direction the guy took it. Uh hello? He didn't even ask me if I was finished.  Something like that should never happen, at least not at a 'nicer' place such at this.  Fine. Whatever,  I let it slip bc I don't like making a scene.

But that wasn't the end of it.  Sometime during the meal (pre-scallop taking incident) our waiter came by, set down a bowl of Mac and Cheese and said it was complimentary.  We received the bill and noticed the $20 Mac and Cheese charge.  So despite protests from the rest of my friends to let it go, I called the waiter over and asked him about the ""complimentary"" Mac and Cheese.  Instead of saying sorry, the below was said:

Waiter (smirking): Did you enjoy it? 
Me (seething at this point): Um.  Yes, it was really good 
Waiter: Good.  I'll get this taken off
Me: Thanks.

Its on the 64th floor and Id have to say that the panoramic view of Las Vegas is AMAZING (luckily we were seated outside which made it more of an experience), but unfortunately the view is the only thing this restaurant offers and thats why I give it two stars.

For an appetizer, our server recommended the Tender Potato Gnocchi (very good) and I wanted to try their Corn Chowder Cappuccino (eh) and also for starters they gave us a basket of bread- all of which were hard. For our entrees we ordered  Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin &  Roasted Chicken w/ a side of Creamed Spinach. The chicken and the creamed spinach tasted like somethin I could make at home and the Bison was alright, nothing too spectacular.

That night there was a wedding dinner reception so all of the servers' attention were focused on them (hey thats fine, you guys got married!) but please also think about the other patrons in the establishment.

We had a party of four and she treated us like third class customers.. when I asked about the two different types of filet mignon, and didn't particularly like one of them, she decided herself to put me down for the other filet mignon and asked how I want it cooked.  I couldn't order myself?? Or decide on something I wanted?? I just asked a question about the menu, not that I wanted one or the other.  She seldom made an appearance after our order, but made our experience worse each time she did.

The Good:
-the restaurant is beautiful and the view is unparalleled
-the food was good, but not great
The Bad:
-the food servings (the filet in particular) were too small for the price
-the wine pairings were underwhelming.  There were at least two wines that all of us disliked
-the service was poor.  The waiting staff was slow to begin with and quickly petered out.  By the end, our table felt ignored for a good half hour.
-the restrooms are pathetic--just sad.
The Ugly:
-our waiter tried to overcharge us $270.  When we first got our bill, we noticed that it had three extra dinners on it, along with a 20% tip.  When we were finally able to find our waiter to call him over, he immediately grabbed the bill and said he knew what was wrong and would fix it--without given us even a chance to explain the problem.  He clearly knew the issue beforehand (but hadn't made any effort to come get the bill from us first).  I can assure you that although we tried to find some innocent explanation for his conduct, everyone in our group left with the impression that the waiter had intentionally tried to slip the extra charges by us (since the bill was so large anyway and we had had several glasses of wine by that point).
For the price you pay to eat here, diners should expect and receive top notch service and food. MIX fails to deliver.

We came here on a Thursday night, was amazed by the view, heads poppin' and body groovin to the DJ set, enjoying our &7.50+ beers-$16 mixed drinks when we see this guy with a mohawk started break dancing in the middle of the dance floor.

OK cool, someone's trying to warm up the dance floor and entertaining those two ladies that needed dance partners.  Next thing I know, the same mohawk guy keeps on trying to break dance.  It's like WHAT THE HECK??!!  A song or two to break dance is OK but from what I saw, a lot of people moved off the floor and some started leaving.  Did I mention this guy was also wearing T-shirt and Tennis shoes?  C'Mon.  For a place that's inside THE HOTEL by Mandalay Bay, you would've thought that they have standards there.

When I go to Vegas clubs, ESPECIALLY on the strip, I expect for everyone to be dressed up or casually dressed up nicely and dancing the way they should!  You would think that they set a certain ambiance with all the soft lighting, view and the service but I guess not.  I understand that you can pay off certain guys to let you go in if you're not up to the dress code but someone needed to step in and ask the guy to chill.

One good thing I liked about this lounge is that you actually have table/chairs that you can sit on and enjoy your company and it's by the DJ booth.

Menu has a wide variety from mild to wild. Standouts included lobster ceaser, tuna tar-tar, foie-gras, chicken surf and turf with stuffed chicken breast and crabmeat...  After, or before, spend some time in the amazing bar that is attached with the same outstanding strip views. AAA wine list and good strong cocktails.

One small gripe - we made a reservation - they did not have it when we got there - they seated us the lounge, we had a drink and they gave us a great table w/in ten minutes, so -  no harm no foul. Also, the chairs are weird.

I'm really sad this place doesn't get more love.  I'm always able to find a seat when I'm here and the last time we visited (earlier this month) there was no one around at all.

I love Mix.  You get to ride in a glass elevator to the (near) top of The Hotel and enjoy an awesome view of Vegas.  Once inside, it's just a chill lounge with lots of seating and a large bar.  They have huge windows to view The Strip, or better yet, you can go outside on their little patio and really soak in the sights.

There's a dj playing some house music at a reasonable level (as in, I can carry on a conversation with my friends) and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  It's the perfect place to bring friends, have a date, or even take family.

I especially love the bathrooms- a room with black floors and walls, a black toilet, a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking Mandalay and the pool, and no outside lights other than the ones making up the Mandalay signs.  It definitely threw me for a loop the first time I came to Mix.

I'm not sure why this place is so slow.... I don't know if they aren't advertising enough and no one knows about it, or if it's because it's a little tricky to find, or because the fact that it's not a club so all the 20-somethings want to party elsewhere....  I really don't get it.

It is a gorgeous restaurant with a beautiful view of the south end of the strip. At night it also doubles as an ultra lounge witha dj that spins house music. 

We went here for my birthday dinner during a Vegas birthday trip last night and was thouroughly satisfied. We started off with various apertifs which were nothing special. We started off with a complimentary bread basket served with whipped butter and fresh peanut butter which was deelish. 

I had the 10 oz NY strip with the house sauce and asparagus and mushroom fricasse for sides. I must say, the steak with the sauce was the best I've ever had. So yummy, its making my mouth water just thinking back. The sides we're also very tasty and complimented the steak nicely. 

For dessert, I had the coco lime sorbet with candied almonds on top. It was very refreshing and light. A perfect dessert for such a heavy protein meal. They brought out the dessert with a sparkler and Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate, a very nice touch, I thought. 

After dessert, they brought us fresh baked madeleines which I found out was thei signature ""end"" to the meal. Yum!

The MIX is a fantastic fine dining experience with a great atmosphere and first class service. Expect to pay at least $100 per person for a 2 course meal & aperitif, however, it is very much worth it.",gZ7DAkCo1FnI61F2LdUzjw,0,0,5,C8FNPoitIJbpM-5CzkuG6g

Our food was fantastic but when we went to pay for the check and handed him the dining credit he gave us a dirty look and walked away. When we got our check back he had already added on his tip, assuming we wouldn't tip him well...he gave himself a nice tip of $25 for a $150 meal.

Mix is located on the 64th floor of The Hotel at Mandalay Bay but the directions to its location was confusing.   Along the casino, we were not clear on where to go and even its employees were not clear on the instructions to find the restaurant.

As we approached the elevators, there were multiple confusing entrances without proper visual cues.   Once we found the elevator, it was evident that it was on the top floor.  The entrance was nice with clear art work which my daughter likens to bubbles.  

The view of the strip is expectedly nice and amazing once it was dark enough to be lighted.   Service was  good but I was not aware of the small dance floor or not.   I did not check out the bathrooms or any place after dinner.   

Cousins ordered foi gras and I think they loved it.  We also traded our entree and were equally impressed of the fish, gnocchi, steak, and crab dish.   I was enthralled with dessert and savoring the chocolate ice cream that was melting in my mouth.   We were also treated with freshly baked madeleines that were mixed with a slight hint of hazelnut.

Our family was treated a to really nice family celebration (thanks Uncle) at the end of the trip.  I would return but there are so many restaurants that by the time of my return (next year), the chef or restaurant may change.

386333,2013-12-30,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Mix was recommend to us by the concierge at the Aria (who was great BTW) as having the most beautiful view with the loveliest French cuisine in all of Vegas, and it did not disappoint. Everything was marvelous. For someone used to dining in fine restaurants, in the U.S. as well as in Europe, I don't say this often or lightly. I very rarely write reviews.

The dishes were genuine and well executed. The foie gras au torchon was exactly as it is served in France. The best way to judge is by going somewhere else the next day, which we did, and honestly, you'll want to go back to Mix. I especially liked the way the menu offered classic dishes as well as newer creations. Mom was happy as well as my indie-film-loving brother. 

However, the real reason to go is for the service. I have read some of the previous reviews and see what's going on. But here's the deal. I hope it is useful:

I respect that customers come in with all kinds of expectations on the level of service. We were 10, with a baby and a 4 year girl, celebrating a pre-wedding dinner with the bride and groom. I asked for the Chef's table for privacy, but we were disappointed to find out that it was not available. Nonetheless, the hostess assured me that we would be in a special area of the restaurant that would not bother anyone else and offered us a glass of champagne, as well, for the inconvenience. She was wonderful! And she was right.

I was very skeptical about sitting in the main dining room because we did not want to spoil any one else evening. But the entire staff was so attentive to our every need that I must say, the entire evening went without a hitch. Of note was a moment, early in the evening, when our 4-year-old spilled her grenadine water with its fancy straw and then had that tense frozen look that precedes the oncoming torrential scream. Within seconds, our servers swooped down with a a napkin, cleaned up and replaced her place setting with a big smile letting her know that everything was okay. Wow! It was nothing short of AMAZING. They treated her like a princess and she really felt like one. 

It's easy to provide good service when everything goes well. But the true note of distinctively great service is how swiftly and professionally the staff handles problems when something goes wrong. At Mix, Mr. Ducasse has a top-notch, experienced staff of professionals -- something often lacking in today's restaurant scene. So, about the $10 sparkling water that you didn't order... it's important to brush up on 5-star restaurant etiquette, because you'll get a lot of that at this restaurant.

The whole evening was filled with extremely good service, timeliness and friendliness that matched the deliciousness of the cuisine and exceeded the expectations of each and every one of us. A memorable evening in every way.",_c6KInAhFT6iyY5XBlkvpg,0,0,5,tfriAp2hXXja23bqcCI2IA

Shrimp Cocktail appetizer - It was good, made us feel a little excited about the dinner.  Ironically it was the best dish and the only one we got not on the Alain Ducasse menu.

Boneless Ribeye - It was not good.  I felt like I paid $46 for a USDA select cut of meat.  It wasn't tender and the fat wasn't juicy.  I cook better steaks on a stove-top at home.

John Dory ""Meuniere"" - The fish was dry, overcooked, and way underseasoned.  This dish was only 1/2 eaten.  

We didn't even order dessert since our main courses were so poor.  Somehow those 3 dishes totaled up to $140 even w/o drinks.

Our food finally arrived, but they could not put it on our table as our appetizer plates were still there. My husband cut into his steak that was supposed to be medium and it was raw. We waited patiently for our waiter to come and ask us if everything was alright but instead he kept talking to the other table completely ignoring us. We finally flagged down another waiter who helped us and returned the steak to be further cooked. The steak came back again raw. At that point in time we lost it and sent it back and asked for our ck. The staff was very dismissive. Basically could care less. In this economy you would think that they would bend over backwards to want to make a customer happy. I had the Cod, and it tasted like Paula Deen had sent in 10 pounds of butter for the dish. Overall, very disappointing. We come to Vegas several times a year for conventions and always want to try new places. We love Olives at the Bellagio and rave about Aureloe at Mandalay Bay. Maybe it is because Mix is owned by the hotel and not separate so the hotel supports it . When we left, everyone in the elevator echoed our feelings on Mix. Very pompous staff, over priced and rude.

Ambiance and white orbs and Michelin  star be damned!  Our service was godawful.

I had never heard of Mix restaurant until a week before I was invited to go there for dinner.  Mix is more known in Vegas as a bar/lounge with great views of the strip and is located at the top of the THEhotel, a part of the Mandalay Bay resort.  You can get up to the lounge by two elevators.  One is a great all glass elevator on the outside of the hotel that provides fantastic views of the strip and the valley beyond as the elevator whisks you to the top of the hotel.  The other is an inside elevator for those afraid of heights.   This outside elevator opens up into the very large bar area.  The bar also offers a balcony where you can sit outside and enjoy sweeping views while you drink and socialize.  You can walk through the bar into the adjoining restaurant.  The restaurant is a circular room done in white and chrome colors with contrasting bright red glassware and windows almost all the way around.  There are strings of clear glass balls hanging down from the ceiling that help to separate the space from the bar.  I suppose it is meant to look sophisticated but it instead it just looks dated, like a set from an old Austin Powers movie.

We started off with an appetizer of the chicken and coconut Thai soup ($16) and a half order of seared duck foie gras ($17/Full order is $32).  The soup had similar ingredients to the traditional Thai Tom Ka however it was watered down and bland.  It tasted as if an amateur chef was trying to replicate a Thai dish and failed.  The foie gras, on the other hand, was luscious and fatty with just a smattering of lemon confit on the top to balance the tastes.  

For dinner, we had the John Dory ""Meuniere"" ($38) and the Slightly Glazed ""NE3"" Pork Belly with spicy ""mangavocao"" salad ($34).  The fish was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry but served with enough fennel and tomatoes to cover the mistake.  The pork, on the other hand, was cooked well but very, very salty.  The mango and avocado salad tasted fine and was artfully presented in a small lettuce leaf, but did not go well with the salty pork meat.  I like fusion cuisine but this tasted more like throwing flavors together simply for the sake of it, rather than for the taste.  Perhaps they should stop trying to think up cute phrases to put in quotation marks on their menu, and concentrate more on cooking well.  We would not order either of these dishes again.

For dessert, we both had the home made ice-cream and sorbet.  You can create your own plate by picking any combination of four ice creams flavors, sorbets or toppings from an extended list of choices ($9).  I had the pistachio and almond ice creams with maraschino cherries and brownie bites toppings.  Your ""creation"" is served simply as two small (and I mean small) ice-cream scoops on a plate with two little cups on the side filled with your choice of toppings.  While the ice cream tasted fine, the maraschino cherries were straight out of a jar from the supermarket and the brownie crumbles were a tad stale.  You could get something tastier and cheaper at your local frozen yogurt store.  This is from a Michelin star chef?

The service was good and the waiter was attentive but there were several times when we had to ask for water.  To quote the waiter's own words, ""it is a bad idea for a restaurant to use red glassware; you can never tell when the glasses are empty"".  If only the restaurant management would note the same point.  Overall, the food was just ok.  But you expect more from a Michelin star chef.  Perhaps the executive chef is not replicating Chef Ducasse's dishes correctly, perhaps the restaurant is just a second thought to the bar or perhaps they are just hoping that you are so tipsy from the bar that you don't notice the imperfections in the food.  In any event, I would definitely recommend bringing your guests to the lounge to enjoy the view and drinks, but then bring them elsewhere to eat.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,0,0,2,BANmRzCqQlJLKcpc9RyN-Q

Went here on a Monday night for 2nd wedding anniversary with the husband per Yelper reviews. 

Atmosphere/first impressions: 
TIP: Check in at the desk off the gaming floor (right by the sporting betting area). Take the elevators up to the top. 

We had reservations, so we got a table by the windows (a MUST).  The view is from the south strip looking north. As the hotel is on the top floor of THEHotel (Mandalay Bay) you get to see the entire Strip. Incredible. Atmosphere is modern trendy yet still manages to feel relaxed and warm. 

Staff:
OUTSTANDING.  The waiter we had was very friendly yet professional. You know you are in the presence of a good staff when you don't notice your water glass being refilled. Also staff has great knowledge of the menu.

Food:
Appetizer- OK don't judge, but we got the Foie Grais. A-MA-ZING. 
Main Course- I got the Seared Tuna and I think it was the most perfectly piece of seared tuna I've ever had. And I eat it a LOT. I asked about the sauce, as I am GF, they put it on the side and checked with the chef. Points for that! Husband got the John Dory ""meuniere"", also delish. 
Dessert- Per our waiters suggestion for GF desserts, we tried the Strawberry Rhubarb. Excellently cooked, a little sweet and sour...perfect light end for a great meal.

We started with the gnocchi and, as others have said, it was incredible....probably one of the best things I have ever tasted. The pea puree was so delicate! Our main course included a wonderfully done duck breast and delicious pistachio encrusted halibut. Portion size was very small for the duck but perfect for the fish. Everything was presented beautifully and had amazing flavor. We ordered profiteroles for dessert and the ice cream came on a bed of smashed merengue cookies which added incredible texture to the dish.

Better to pay in $ than in Euro. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, so fitting for special occasion or to impress your date. The restaurant is at teh 64th floor of the THE hotel next to Mandalay Bay. They share a parking garage, but different lobby. The restaurant has 360 glass window so you should be able to enjoy Vegas night view wherever you sit. The interior is all white with this blown glass cubes coming down from the ceiling.
The food is pretty good. I ordered one of the signature appetizer: the japanese sea bream sashimi with popcorn. The sashimi is seasoned well, better than what i had at Le Bernardin in New York. For my entre, I ordered teh $75 fillet mignon topped with foei gras and black truffle. I did get generous portion of foei gras and black truffle shavings. The black truffle is great but the foei gras was too big, too rich. It was a good dish, but you get what you paid for. I wish i had ordered Alain Ducase's specialty, the lobster curry thing. 
My partner ordered chicken/lobster surf and turf, and his dish was excellent. Crispy skin on the chicken but still moist.

My husband and I sat in the aforementioned ""booth"" and found that while they were comfortable, you are siting so far away from your companion that you have to practically yell to talk. We ended up sharing a single side and found it much more enjoyable. 

I had a glass of cava which had both bubbles and booze, so I was happy. My husband had a pomegranate manhattan which was surprisingly good. Not too sweet and very well balanced, so he was happy. 

We also participated in the nightly toast which could have been cool but the ""champagne"" was warm and flat. IMO, if you are going to offer something to your guests, it shouldn't suck. I would rather not have had it at all.

Most ladies at our table ordered steaks and when one of them was not prepared according to how it was ordered we were given attitude from the server like it was our fault.

I did not pay for entry or for any of the drinks or appetizers i enjoyed. I was ""on the list""! I think it was the first time I was ever ""on a list"". I sure felt special, even though I didn't have the little light-up toy that indicated that you were part of the cool club, the lady said that I was ""on the list"". Woot.

I was here for a private party during a conference at Mandalay Bay. The view is outstanding, even (especially?) the elevator ride up. We had an open bar and wait staff carrying trays of appetizers around, and a row of girls offering glasses of wine at the entrance. I grabbed a glass of wine but quickly abandoned it for a series of long island iced teas. We admired the view for a while, got significantly drunk, and then I capped the night off with a gin & tonic. I don't remember the elevator ride down, but I somehow made it back to my hotel room safely. The drinks were excellent and strong!

The view from the open-air balcony (not really balcony; it felt entirely enclosed because of the high glass) was, as I mentioned, utterly fantastic. Starting from the Luxor pyramid with its beam of light into the sky, all the way up to the Wynn at the top of the strip. Fantastic.

Having said all that, I don't think I'd go unless someone else was paying. I didn't look at a single menu or price up there, but I'm sure it wouldn't be worth it. If you can convince someone else to pay, though, do it!",sL3GRK9icLT5imEAvYzdLA,0,0,4,HGAvbk4qu881eOJX3zHbZQ

Excellent food in a fancy restaurant! Expensive but well worth it. And the view from the top floor of Mandalay Bay... awesome. We sat outside on the patio too which was perfect. Everything we ordered was fabulous. We started with Kampachi sashimi, Bluefin tuna tartare, and Pork ribs appetizers. The sashimi was my fave. Then lobster and filet mignon for dinner. And ended with the Rum bread with Honey Vanilla Bean ice cream and Madeleines with Nutella. Yum, yum, yum.

693636,2011-01-31,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Picked Mix based on their Michelin rating and reputation of the chef. Overall, the experience wad awkward from beginning to end. When you get out of the elevator and walk to the host desk, you find that it is on the other side and have to walk through the bar to get to the main dining room. Strange and not welcoming...

Service was pretty uncomfortable, not very polished, and there was no connection/personality. We saw the server about two times throughout the night and that's about it. No quality check either... My friends and I have not seen each other in over a year, so we did not pay much attention to the shortcomings. Busser was really good though, he was the only one who payed attention to us all night.

What is up with the pad and pencil on the table? And I hate to be picky, but why is there salt and pepper on the table during dinner? Lastly, why are the hostesses sitting down on the bar stool that is behind their desk?

Sorry, I need to shut off my brain sometimes and just enjoy dinner.

Food was food though. Our party of three had: Tuna Tar Tare, Shrimp Cocktail, Foie Gras, Roasted Lamp Chops, Seared Duck Breast, and Chicken. For wine we had a bottle of Dr. Loosen's Eroica. Tasty. Oh props on the bread selection: Parker Rolls, Fusettes, Focaccia... The peanut butter spread did nothing for me, regular butter with Maldon on top is fine.  

The dining room is gorgeous and the views are stunning (esp. from the lounge). We decided to have a post dinner cocktail + dessert here, but was underwhelmed by their selection.",943ce4BE0tq_Ts1pNEq0VQ,3,1,2,MZSvjAP773LtqxHohFzIGw

While the views and the interior of the restaurant were amazing, the food and service left much to be desired.  To begin with, the hostess didn't ask if we'd prefer to sit inside or outside.  We ended up sitting outside...the heat and the altitude began to make us all feel nauseated.  I also made the mistake of wearing heels to the restaurant...the floor of the patio was like a deck and my heel kept getting stuck in the floor.  Also, every time someone walked by the table, it felt like the floor was shaking (wish I would have known to bring dramamine to dinner).  When the waiter came to our table he asked if we had a show to attend.  We should have said yes as this might have lead to quicker service.  We ended up not ordering wine or cocktails for the table (due to the nausea), and the waiter seemed to write our table off.  After we placed our food order, it took an hour for dinner to come.  While the food (when it did come) wasn't terrible, it definitely wasn't worth the $90/person we ended up spending.  The waiter didn't come to check on us at all throughout the meal.  He even spent 20 minutes flirting with some girls at the table next to us while we were waiting for our bill.  When we complained to the manager at the end of the meal, he asked why we didn't come speak with him since he was outside the whole time.  I don't know about your experiences, but in other restaurants, the manager usually circulates and checks on each table themselves rather than waiting for diners to come up to them.

Actual Rating: 1.5 stars.  We chose MIX based on the previous yelper's reviews, their chef, and multitude of previous favorable foodie reviews.   If it wasn't for all the amazing views, I would have rated this 1 star. 

Despite making our reservation over 2 months ago, we some how ended up in the corner seat next to the fake bamboo with no view, even though there we asked to be seated at a table with a view.  Apparently, those tables were ""reserved"".   Funny, I thought I had a reservation. 

The very first words out of our waiter's mouth were not something like: ""Hello, my name is X, welcome to Mix"".  Instead, they were:  "" Hello folks, I'm sure you know our chef was recently rated best in the world.""  followed by a soliliquy bragging of the place's rave reviews.  

Long story short: The food was no better here than at a standard resort casino cafe. 2 of us ordered the lobster, 1 chicken, and 1 ""The Perfect Bite"" steak dish.  The two who ordered the lobster actually sent it back, YES, that's right I said it: The best chef in the world had 2 lobster dishes sent back to him.  It was hard, rubbery, cooked incorrectly, and tasted stale drenched in a butter curry sauce. Chicken was not even all that great.  And being from Chicago, the steak had nothing on any one of the steak joints you would find in downtown Chicago.  Also ordered 6 appetizers including 2- $24 vegetable cookpots which tasted like bagged frozen veggies - presented well in a ramekin dish.   Desserts?  Oh yeah, we ordered them but I honestly cannot remember what they were, so they must have been nothing to write home about. 

Some guy with a fake french accent came over after we sent back the lobster dishes; apparently annoyed, and asked if we wanted to try anything more.  Ummmm... no thanks, especially if it tastes like that!  

I will share with you something good-   When you use the urinal in the men's room, there is a fantastic view of Mandalay Bay to keep you occupied while you relieve yourself.

We got here about 20 minutes before our reservation and were greeted downstairs by a very rude hostess (hence the 4 stars) who said ""Just go up the elevator, OK""... so up we went, which the elevators are so cool - you can see the entire strip out the window - and then were greeted into the lounge. The lounge area is outside and they have lots of heaters and AMAZING views of the strip - we sat and had a drink for about 15 min - and it was so nice. they also serve appetizers out there if you just want a drink + app. Then we went into the restaurant and had window seating - which was again so  beautiful. The entire strip is lit up  behind you and the restaurant atmosphere is so pretty. Our waiter was super attentive and sweet. The food was delicious! We had the chicken and the filet plus two sides of the fries (so yummy) and the potatoes (equally as yummy). For dessert we had the chocolate souffle which is take it or leave it (not as yummy). I give 4 stars based on the dessert, our waiter forgetting my coffee, and the rude hostess downstairs.

The food was really good, not great.  I had the striped bass with asparagus served two ways, and it was tasty.  My friend had the beef tenderloin and short rib with these great block potatoes.  Those were really good.  We also shared the tuna tartar and shrimp cocktail appies.  The shrimp cocktail was on top of a horseradish compote.  It's was very tasty.  Of course we had lovely cocktails, I had a lovely glass (well 3, should have bought the bottle) of pinot grigio.

Went here with a friend of mine who happens to be a client as well as his colleagues.  The service was great in seating all 10 of us in the middle of the restaurant so we could get a feel of the atmosphere, rather than be on the side lines. 

I enjoyed the new york strip and went big with eh sides with mac and cheese and french fries.  Not to take away from the perfectly cooked steak, but their mac and cheese was amazing, I use theirs as my benchmark now.  Fries can be messed up, but they did them well.

Nightcap atmosphere:
We ended the night with some drinks overlooking the strip in a non-stuffy and mellow atmosphere.  I would recommend this place over the foundation room.  

Only con I can think of (splitting hairs here)
Only downside can be if you are sat by a group of cigar smokers in the outdoor lounge.  The smoke gets trapped there due to the winds that wrap around high rises, so the open air lounge does not help air out the place.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy smoking cigars once in awhile, but it is not pleasant if you are not indulging and are left with the second hand smoke (sorry I am from California and probably sound like a hypocrite to most readers).",-2pw86nuk7Y-t2r1ACEmnw,1,1,5,wo-J2-ubhAiaZa-XaFdpPQ

Mix is just such a place.  I was completely blown away by the décor.  One of the most beautiful restaurant interiors I have ever seen.

809569,2012-01-03,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"First dinner of the New Year @Mix. We came for the view and the food and the restaurant did not disappoint.  

A private glass elevator takes you directly to the top while you enjoy the view on the ascent to the 65th floor. It was a little confusing arriving in the dark and walking thru a long bar/club area and then past the kitchens before we were greeted (a hostest was not present at the booth either so we were confused on where to go). However, we did eventually find our table. The decor is a curtain of glass bubbles with white and red accents.  This place looked ready for a great valentine's day date. 

Our cheerful and friendly server arrived soon after we were seated in our booth and was eager to please us. Throughout our service, he provided detailed descriptions about the dishes and knowledgeable explanations about how each entree was prepared.  He was as excited talking about the food as we were to try it!

We started with the crab salad.  It had all my favorite ingredients (fresh crab, avocado, cilantro, cucumber, etc) but there was a lingering bitter aftertaste that we could not place. It distracted from the flavors of the dish and we were ready to move on to the  next course.

For the main course, I tried the rack of lamb/tenderloin with a tian of eggplant.  The lamb was so flavorful and tender (prepared seared and then sous vide) on a bed of caramelized onions with tomato and the eggplant, tomato tian was bursting with fresh flavor that complemented the lamb well.  My husband ordered the atlantic seabass in a shellfish sauce.  Also well prepared (seared and then baked) with melt in your mouth flavors. 

Every meal should end on a sweet note and Mix reserves a whole page of their menu just for dessert!  I ordered the profiteroles for one.  It's 6 mini cream puffs served with some homemade chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  It reminded me of a ""deconstructed"" eclair. My husband opted for the signature mix candy bar. Covered in chocolate with gold leaf and delicate wafer thin slices inside - it's a candy bar to eat with a fork, if only to savor it a little bit longer. The lime coconut sorbet that comes with the candy bar is more lime than coconut and provides a tart contrast (maybe too much) to the delicately sweet candy bar.  Compliments of our server, we received another delight with a freshly baked lemon madeleine (served right out of the pan) to dip in chocolate spread to top off our evening. 

As you stroll along on your way out, there are bathrooms tucked away just before the elevator. In the ladies room, two of the stalls have floor to ceiling windows for you to gaze outside as you go about your business (I'm told there's a similar set up in the men's room).  It takes a moment to remind yourself that it's one-way glass and what you really came to the ladies room to do. 

All in all, dinner at Mix was a great start to the new year.

The waiter said the special was a filet mignon with foie gras and truffle with truffle reduction, the price was $75 per main course. I'm a lover of truffles and foie gras so we ordered one each. The waiter delivered our appetizers I'd rate it as 3.5 stars I got the pasta with braised beef. Now about the main course. The $75 steak was good, nothing special but nothing bad about it. The foie gras was actually duck foie gras. Duck foie gras costs a fraction of what goose foie gras costs and it tastes substantially subpar to it's goose counterpart. The truffle shavings were not fresh and the type you would buy online or eBay for $5-$10 one black truffle. Pretty much it was the lowest possible quality truffle and foie gras you can buy. In my opinion they could have spent $2-$4 more in ingredients when they charge $75 a dish. I had a hard time eating it knowing that most Americans didn't know much about foie gras and truffle. It felt like a complete scam and rip off. Service was mediocre they did not refill our sparkling water. Also we made a reservation through their online system and the lady told us we didn't have one.

I went with my husband thinking that this was going to be one of the best dinners we would have on our trip. Boy were we disappointed.  The service was awful. Waiters and waitresses were running around the restaurant all night.   We had to to move tables after they sat us near the waitress station. Which ultimately didn't matter, as the restaurant was so loud and rowdy.  

The food was like bad wedding food.  We had the gnocci and tuna tartar appetizer. Eh.  The cod was awful as was the wagyu.  We complained to both the manager and general manager.  They offered us free dessert, but after such a horrendous meal, we passed.  

For such a ""fancy"" restaurant, the dress attire was not existent.  People were in flip flops and shorts. Definitely not a quality restaurant, and not worth the money.

Save your money and time.  There was nothing enjoyable about our dinner.  We would have had better luck gambling the money than wasting it on this meal.  There are better restaurants to try on the strip.

Robuchon was in its own class and I will review it later. But I would recommend trying Mix. 
we had the tasting menu which at that time was a gnocchi, lobster and filet and it was all awesome. the problem with trying to write review 6 months later is I cant remember everything but I do know it was my favorite.

This place is supercool and great to hang out in and enjoy a beverage. 

Now, for the restaurant, and most importantly, the food.  The food selection on the menu is decent, with most of the standard fair you'd expecet (a handful each of appetizers, fish & seafood, meats &  poultry).  Expect to pay a hefty price for your view, with prices ranging from 45 to 60+ dollars for entrees (and thats for non ""market price"" items), which is a little silly, even for French (or French/American) cuisine in Vegas.  Tack on appetizers, a beverage, and dessert (at your discretion) and expect $150 a head.

The food preparation was respectable, but, by no means were my companions and I impressed.   The foie was decent, as was the bisque.  The huckleberry sauce for the fois was well balanced with just enough tartness and sweetness, but, one of my liver pieces was a bit veiny.  Kudos for having caviar on the menu.  The fish was nicely prepared (not overdone) but relatively straight forward (no pow).  The scallop caesar was good, but the romaine wedge seemed tough, and the addition of basalmic over the dish made everything a little too tangy.  Bacon makes anything taste better, and this was no exception as there were plenty of rendered bacon bits.  Oddly enough, none of us had any meat dishes, which I would've like to have been able to comment on.  The desserts looked fabulous, but only tasted okay good and didn't quite close the deal for me.  But, overall a decent meal.  Unfortunately, I was left with the feeling that the food experience paled in comparison to the personal experience as the presentation and service outshined the flavors.

The most memorable things were 1) the cool environment, 2) the sheer number of handblown glass bulbs hanging from the central chandelier and of course 3) the view.  

Really, this place is all about ambiance.  And thats ok, as long as it doesn't try to pretend to be something else.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat, if only to enjoy the view from the top.  But next time, i may decide to grab a bite elsewhere before heading up there to relax.  Maybe at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar downstairs?",zasaZf_10js4d96NXDC-RQ,4,1,3,Q3BmBTwGeMXVgxRQ5DOcqA

We have been to the Mix lounge so many times that it was finally time to give their restaurant a try. We each tried their tasting menu with wine pairing and it included the following: 

Amuse Bouche 

Spicy Crab Salad: This was super fresh and made a great starter to the rest of the meal. The portion was great too. The Riesling that it was paired with was excellent as well. 

Butternut Squash Ravioli: served with butter emulsion and super creamy...probably my favorite dish! Another white was served along with it. 

Seared diver scallops: the scallop was excellent, however, I did not enjoy the citrus endive marmalade it was served with...kinda reminded me of sour onions. 

Rack of Colorado Lamb: it was served with piquillo peppers and delicious. At this point in time it was getting harder and harder to enjoy my wine, so the hubby had to start helping me with the wine pairings. We had already enjoyed a few at the lounge before dinner is my excuse! 

Pre-dessert: was more like a very sweet & tangy, frothy shake. 

Armagnac ice cream: a creamy puff pastry...took one bite and I was done! This one is served with a port and I'm not a fan of port so I passed on it. 

Service: Excellent! Our server was awesome and he even allowed my hubby to swap out his scallops for the lobster with no extra charge. We used a restaurant.com coupon and had no problem at all...it was definitely worth it. 

I was pretty happy with our meal here, but also pretty buzzed by the end of meal too! Overall, great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or for small groups.",QotsNecIJWCOr_ZAywE8Gw,1,0,4,mwkouaADrk0pxWK65Z12Dg

I know Vegas is all about the velvet rope, but we went when half the lounge was cordoned off for a ""private party"" while the other half was blocked-off for the bottle service tables.  I assume it's like this every night.  

Now I'm okay with the idea of bottle service, but why make a lounge all blocked off like that - kind of inhibits ""MIXing.""  And it never feels good to have goons in the middle of the place gaurding entry/exit points like you are in Soviet Russia.

I went to Risque in The Paris a couple years back and had the table service, I've done that a couple times, but it isn't like that at Mix .  At Risque, tables are reserved, that's all.  You can freely walk around or chit-chat with whomever you please.  It's cooler.  Mix's setup leaves very little real estate to walk around in.  

The balcony was totally closed too, even though it wasn't that cold and didn't seem very windy, plus they did have heat lamps.

The crowd was also lame, mostly older guys, like old, like 50s.  I'm over 30 and I still felt like I was partying with papa.  I was there with another dude and a good looking girl, and they got each of us for a $20 cover.  Even the blond girl?  Duh, bad business, morons.  With the crowd I saw at the pool in Mandalay earlier, it shouldn't have been that bad, but it was.

And the music was just junk, you couldn't dance to it.  The DJ apparently didn't notice he had an empty floor all night, or didn't try different stuff to get people up.  Or it just wasn't working with the people they let in.

Another threesome that sat at a nonreserved table for a couple hours like us gave up and left at the same time.  We agreed:  Mix = bad wedding + cash bar.

* ON the 64th floor, so no smoke from the Casino.  The restaurant was non smoking.  That said, the bar was either smoking or non-smoking was not enforced.  At certain tables it may not truly be non smoking.  Not sure about this.  

* On the 64th floor, the best view of Vegas

* 15,000 glass ball chandelier, really cool.

* We got sat next to the balcony.  One reviewer noted how hot it was outside; today it was ~50 F and ~6 tables near the balcony froze every time the door opened (which was a lot!).  This could easily be you, so be warned.  You might also sweat every time the door opens, depending on time of year.  


Service

* they showed a cheap tasting menu downstairs.  When we got upstairs, they said they didn't have it.  Not cool

* The waiters were very fast and attentive without being intrusive.  Entire staff, from waiters to busboys were really fast.  Our appetizers were out in record time.  Terrific service.

Food

* kind of expensive

* very good.  Had the lobster, beef/foie gras, crab salad, and gnocchi plus the mix candy for dessert.


Overall: go for the view.  Service is great.  Food is very good but $$.  Would give this a 4.5 star on food and service alone.  But the other stuff lower the rating. Don't trust them when they offer cheap tasting menus.

The service was horrid and the food - well, the food was very, very small. We started with an appetizer that could have been hidden under a nickel. After a 6 course meal I went out for dinner...

Incredibly, the food was really mediocre. One of the key signs for me is the bread a restaurant serves. Heaven is when the bread comes to the table fresh from the oven. The bread here was old and cold. The tuna tartar was passable when eaten with the mango salsa. The rest was more of the same - small, mediocre and over-priced.

Georg and I like to drop a few hundred dollars on at least one dinner extravaganza every time we make it to Vegas.  We like to choose restaurants with some kind of view, and this one was AWESOME.  walking through the bar area to the restrooms was amazing, I've never seen the strip like that and I have been to Vegas at least 25 times.

My parents are all about the platinum cards EVERYWHERE so I'm all about the free rooms for me and my friends, which means that it's ok to spent almost half a thousand dollars on the grand tasting menu here for two.

Some things to note:

DRESS nicely.  We sat there for about 4 hours or so, and saw people get turned away and make a fuss, but we also saw that the people who were dressed nicely; i.e. dresses and dress shirts + ties were seated next to the windows and the people who were dressed so so were seated in the back, or under the stair case.

ORDER the floating island dessert.  this is the best dessert I have ever had.  Georg says its the second best dessert he's every had (first best at chez TJ)  I love desserts that aren't so sweet.  He loves desserts that are sweeeeeeeet.  This was perfect.  It was sweet, savory, creamy and fresh, and light. PERFECTION.

The minus .5 stars comes from the small amount of leg room under our two person booth, slighty weird ""children of the corn"" type bus boy with the glazed look, and the fact that when our server asked how the food was and we said ""great!...blahblahblah awesome!"" he walked away saying ""yessss"" under his breath and gave a little mini fist pump.",Q3s-w9ZtBJbUUO8UBc5mRg,0,0,5,NSA8s6MHidEbq-2Hw5qzTw

I picked :

Tuna Tartar as the starter
Lobster Au Curry as the main course
House special cheese cake for savory dessert


I would say, honestly, all of the three stood out with nice surprise and consistent quality! 

Fresh, juicy, rich flavor for all the protein I chose. The texture is so important when I pick sea food since you can overcook them just in seconds. My lobster was so tender and tasty while not overpowered by the curry sauce around. Not easy at all! When the plate came I was like:"" wow ,it is small"", then I realize there was 4 or 5 piece of lobster meat without any shell, side veggie or so, PURE LOBSTER MEAT BITE, oh, sorry, a small portion of risotto, which adds more change of texture.

1078731,2013-12-30,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"A recent trip to Vegas landed us at Mix.  My husband picked this place out and I could not have been happier with the entire experience.

We started off with a few cocktails in the lounge area.  Breathtaking view of the strip at night from 64 floors up.  A ride in a glass elevator to the top gives you an out of this world experience.

The lounge itself is dark, intimate and  fun.  Tables  are adorned with drink menus which are lit up to display the delicious drinks they offer.  We were there to kick off the night, which entails a lounge toast with a complimentary glass of champagne.  Clink glasses with your neighbors and staff - a sure way to start the night off right, all while soaking in Sin Cities night lights.

After a few cocktails we moved to the restaurant.  A complete opposite spectrum versus the lounge.  Pristine, white, airy, beautiful and romantic.  Decor is fantastic, I could not help but stare. Service was phenomenal from beginning to end.

I  started off with an order of the shrimp cocktail.  A lovely dish, more like a salad, with jumbo shrimp atop greens mixed with horseradish and a tomato syrup.  Mix it all together and you have a scrumptious combo that will leave any jarred cocktail sauce in the dust.  Simply amazing.  The flavors melded into a creation I could eat over and over again.

For dinner I ordered the Roasted Maine Lobster ""Au Curry"" by our servers recommendation.  Chunks of sweet maine lobster atop coconut basmati rice with a subtle curry sauce.  The sweet lobster and coconut rice really accented the curry sauce beautifully.  The portion was certainly nicer than anticipated and I was left feeling quite full.  

We had also ordered a bottle of wine and was happy to have a wine expert help pair wine to our meal choices.  5 stars all around!!!",j9gLXtR52xgVpHP6KgLqkQ,1,0,5,islePHPAo71E15ZLFCGYuw
1079501,2008-04-15,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Very nice food and ambiance, but very very expensive. 

According to our friendly waiter, miX is supposed to comprise both heaven and hell. The bar uses dark colors reminiscent of flames, because as we all know, drinking is evil and alcohol is the work of the devil. The main dining area uses light colors without seeming bright or harsh. It's surrounded by a curtain of glass handblown balls that are supposed to represent rain from the heavens. A few of the tables are sheltered by a white pod that looks like something from Star Trek. We sat outside, with a perfect view of the gigantic glittering sign for THEhotel at eye level. I guess that means we were in Purgatory? 

In the bar, I ordered a $16 cocktail called Violet, which was fruity but not cutesy or too sweet. It was delicious and potent. When we sat down at our table, we were given a basket of different kinds of bread and proceeded to tear little nibbles off of each one, slathered them in peanut-butter (I'd say it was one part peanut butter to 10 parts butter) and very satisfingly ruined our collective appetites. 

We easily chose our meals - I had the pistachio crusted sea bass with parmesan foam and a side of ""the best macaroni & cheese you'll ever have."" The sea bass was fantastic. The mac & cheese was okay, but not the best I've ever had - everyone knows I like it cheap & gooey. I tasted some of my companions' meals too - bison in a peppery crust, duck breast, and gnocchi. All really tasty and beautifully prepared. 

Most of us didn't order appetizers because we were a little floored by the prices. My friends and I are Bay Area foodies, but this place was pretty expensive by our standards. The average main course was around $50, and appetizers were $20ish. 

But what really stumped us was the wine list. We saw one bottle in there for $36,000. Another one for $12,000. Those were prices for cars, not wine. We asked the sommelier to help us choose a bottle of wine in the two-digit range, and he found a nice Australian Shiraz for us. It was excellent wine, but I don't typically spend more than $20 on a bottle, maybe $50 if it's especially nice. 

All in all, we divided up the check among 7 of us, and each paid about $100. I'm afraid some people felt cheated who didn't drink wine or order an appetizer. I would have to say it was nice, but not nice enough to warrant those prices. It wasn't the French Laundry, yunno?",JdcEj9YlyQY8RvTdyFXJPQ,2,2,4,m3lb1XLiYsdnJBuURnFo6g

Tamara had gnocchi followed by scallops, and I had the ""artisanal pasta with bison osso bucoo"" (can you believe my wife the near-vegetarian actually ate the bison? It was that good!) followed by the ""lobster au curry"" (I thought the menu of Ducasse's classics was a FANTASTIC idea - most chef-fueled restaurants forget that most people eating there will not have the opportunity to go to the other chef's venues!)

Visually, the restaurant is quite nice.  Service was Satisfactory but it was clear waitstaff was serving too many tables.

Had the foie gras with truffles.   It tasted rancid.  Waitstaff wasn't around to discuss so demurred to next course.  Had the barramundi with veggies.   Fish was ok, not spectacular, but vegetables were so heavily salted to be inedible.  Wife's main course was similarly poor.  At this point it was clear that something was very, very wrong here.  We skipped dessert & wine as we really weren't enjoying the food.  When they brought out the Madeleines at the end of the meal we simply refused them.  

The tell was that the waiter never asked us how our food was.  Obviously, he knew there was a problem in the kitchen.  I slashed his tip to 5% for that - if he didn't care, neither would I.

Mix was the biggest fine dining dissapointment I have had in years.  I certainly wouldn't want my name associated with this restaurant if I was chef.   Don't even waste your time or money.",iHR6NSXXgnUBAEUbN7ufvA,0,0,1,sGeO7A7VRFTVoRJP-n2__g

Our experience here after spending 500 dollars was horrible. I had excellent service at craft steak at MGM and better food. Our waiter was great at MGM making jokes with us and talking with us.

The decor is simple yet unique and kinda spacey (if that works). There is a swirley staircase in the middle of the restaurant and the color of everything is all white making it appear very clean and elegant. The restaurant is surrounded by windows and has a great view of Vegas. There are strings of glassy-like bubbles around the room which looked pretty cool - very different. The one thing that stood out was the service. The service was outstanding and exceptional. They were very attentive to what you needed and ordered. I felt like a queen and was treated very well for such a place. The food on the other hand was a little different for me, but none the less it was a new experience in fine dining and was fairly tasty. The price however was a little much. For 4 people we ended the night with a $400 bill. I guess that's not that bad compared to some places, but you know how it goes. I had the beef sirloin which was pretty tender and tasty, except I was very fond of the sauce. The potatoes that came with it were differnet but bland. My boyfriend had ordered the snapper which was really tender and tasty. Our friends ordered the halibut which was very fresh and tender/tasty as well along with the bison which was something different to see on the menu. That as well was extreeememely tender and different. For appetizer we had the tuna tartar (which was my fav to eat with the variety bread basket) and the spricy crab salad which wasn't spicy at all and not very tasty to me. However, the desserts were very pretty but not so tasty. We had the apricot dessert which wasn't my favorite because the apricots were soooo sour it made your face look funny. the pistachio ice cream it came with was very good though. Our friends had the chocolate dome was looked tasty but I didn't try it because of the peanuts (allergy). the BEST part of the meal was the finishing touches of the MADELINES. the MADELINES were sooooo goooooooood. They were freshly baked and warm right out of the oven and served with a little bit of warm chocolate sauce served on the side. If I could, I would've ate a ton of them instead of ordering the apricot dessert. I'd go back just for the madelines (seriously, no joke!).

We dined here and visited the lounge part afterword. Here is why it's a 4 over 3 for both parts- 

Service- good...definitely friendly. Our server and I chatted about both being from Fremont and he was a super nice guy. He seemed genuinely happy to be there as well. He comped us our cocktails I think since we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing. He asked us if we'd be there a few nights and we said we would be and offered us complimentary cocktail vouchers for another one of Mandalay Bay's fine dining restaurants. I used a Restaurant.com certificate, which my boyfriend absolutely hates, but it was for $50. I felt kind of like an a-hole for asking to use it after getting $30 worth of cocktails comped, but our server was super nice and gracious about it so we gave him a little extra for tip. 

The food is great and the view is fabulous sitting at the window, but the high ceilings and strange (but cool) design make the place echo like a school cafeteria. It was hard to get a romantic feel with that. It's beautiful inside and the restaurant and lounge sections are separated enough. 


The wine pairing was great because we were able to try some really interesting varietals with our courses. Also...the homemade peanut butter they serve with the great selection of bread was SO yummy! 

The lounge has a great outdoor area where you'll get some amazing pictures and a GREAT view of the strip at night. The crowd, however...a little funky. If you've been to the Holy Cow in SF...that's what it reminded me of. Great people watching and strange Europeans dancing like they are having a seizure.... but definitely funky.

Upon exiting the elevator, you'll enter and pass through the lounge and bar area first. The lounge area has nice outdoor seating which has an amazing view of the Vegas strip with the Luxor pyramid right outside. The dining area was towards the back which was very open and bright even with the dimmed lights. We were seated in the booth area where you can see the pretty Vegas lights outside if your seat was facing the window.

They brought us a mixed bread basket which had four different types of bread (mini French baguette, pimiento bread, a dinner roll, and I think the other one was just white bread) with butter and peanut butter (butter that has chunks of peanuts in it). I loved the pimiento bread with the regular butter, but the peanut butter was also really good. I just wished that the butter was a little bit softer or melted so it's more spreadable on the bread.

We skipped the appetizers since we were getting full from the bread basket, but they had a good and solid selection. We decided to save stomach real-estate for dessert.

We mainly ordered from the Alaine Ducasse Classics menu as the waiter has suggested since that's what they're mostly known for. 

What we ordered:

*Roasted Main Lobster ""Au Curry"" - My boyfriend ordered this dish and I had a couple (ok, maybe a few) bites off his plate. It was so delicious! I really liked the coconut basmati rice that it came with. I was kinda jealous of his dish and wished I ordered the same thing. But I wanted to order something different so we can both try two things. They didn't skimp on the lobster portion and was actually very generous with it. He almost didn't finish the lobster because there were really big chunks. The lobster was cooked well and wasn't chewy. I just loved the flavor of the whole dish. I definitely recommend this dish if it's your first time here.

*Atlantic Seabass - Although I enjoyed my bf's dish, I still enjoyed what I ordered. The fish was just fresh and so meaty that it was very filling. My dish came with asparagus, octopus, littleneck au gratin, and baby squid. The octopus, littleneck, and baby squid were cooked really well and wasn't chewy. I'm always worried about seafood being overcooked since they get difficult to eat once it does. The asparagus was probably the best asparagus I've had in awhile. I kinda wish there was some sort of carb with this dish, but I figured that they skipped that because it'll end up being too heavy. Nonetheless, it was a very satisfying meal.

*Peach Melba - Mmmm soooooo good! We pretty much annihilated this dessert. It's a nice light dessert and a great way to end a good meal. 

They also brought us complementary fresh Madeleines with nutella dipping sauce after we ate our dessert. So we were pretty glad that we didn't order a chocolate dessert.

I've never walked into a restaurant and been more comfortable in my life. No cold air blasting on you in the middle of your meal. This adds so much to the overall dining experience. Restaurateurs should pay more attention to this detail. 
The food was wonderful. The view is amazing! The decor here is beautiful. There is a magnificent display of glass bubbles dangling from the ceiling and encircling the center dining area. The floor is mirrored with a white medallion design. 
To start the meal they brought out a small serving of braised short ribs with polenta. So good! I ordered the chicken and lobster surf and turf. It was incredible. I'm usually not a chicken fan, but I knew that it'd be good here, so I went for it. I was not disappointed at all. It was actually a stuffed chicken and it was so moist and flavorful. The lobster was great, of course, too. But I was most impressed with how good the chicken was. We didn't order dessert but they brought us out piping hot madelines with a chocolate hazelnut sauce anyways. It was the perfect way to end the meal.

We had the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was a formidable meal which took us over 3 hours to complete. The lamb loin was the best lamb I have ever had. The loin was seared with some herbs and then put in the oven for a little bit. It was still very rare inside. The meat, sourced from a special breeder in Colorado, was evenly marbled, and had all the wonderful goodness of lamb without any of the gaminess that some diners object to. The lamb was paired with some Syrah whose name I can't remember, but it was also good.

Mix Lounge is an easy go-to when people come to visit. As long as your guest can appreciate something more than a dive bar, they should love Mix. Cocktails are set at Strip prices (i.e. not cheap), but the drinks are quality pours and the atmosphere is spectacular. I always try to hit it when it opens (5pm) so we can snag an outside table. It is a great way to start out the evening, especially if you are doing dinner afterward, as you can grab a drink before dinner, admire the view and then be on your merry way. Oh yeah, and make sure you hit up the restrooms, always a great experience for out-of-towners. If you are doing an after-dinner drink, order the cheesecake, it is one of the best in the Valley.",JqfQCJlKeiALcL3v0bYjAw,0,0,5,ciYhP-9MACNq1WgTTk777w
1389482,2013-02-26,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"What a terrible experience!  My boyfriend, best friend and her husband went to Mix for what we were expecting to a spectacular experience and it was quite the opposite.  Although we were very pleased with the ambiance and the spectacular view, no other part of the evening was pleasant.

The four of us dressed appropriately for the restaurant per their ""dressy"" description but when a table of about a dozen younger, we'll call them ""boys"" showed up in jeans and undershirts we were a bit taken aback.  If you are going to advertise that you are a ""dressy"" establishment you should stand by that standard.  But the boys attire was the least of our concerns.  A couple of them were obviously inebriated and at one point one of them excused himself to, and I apologize for the choice of words, but vomit.  When he came back to the table he was no better than when he left.  He could barely sit in his chair or keep his head up straight.  By this time we noticed that management was ""standing by"" but they took no action to ask the boys to excuse their friend from the establishment.  Their hesitation in doing so resulted in the same boy getting up from the table once again and not quite making it to the restroom this time... he vomited right there at the hostess area.  Although it appeared one table found this amusing, we did not.  And we were not the only ones.  My boyfriend did the right thing and approached the manager to inquire on why they didn't take action sooner so as to avoid this scene and he was told ""they have protocol"".  Apparently their protocol involves allowing their guests to vomit at will.  My boyfriend was also told that since the boys were guests of the hotel they did not wish to ask them to leave.  I'm sorry, were WE not guests of the hotel?  And not only were we guests of the hotel but we were staying in their 2,000 sq ft media suite so we weren't just you average joe-schmos trying to act like we were ""somebodies"" or try to get something from them.  The manager made no apology to my boyfriend about the incident and instead gave him the attitude of ""what do you expect us to do"".  His attitude toward the situation was completely unprofessional and inexcusable.  

Now, aside from the unexpected show that came with dinner, the food itself was absolutely terrible.  We were served a basket of mixed breads which weren't even warm, in fact their temperature was more of that they were just pulled out of the refrigerator.  We ordered the gnocchi and tuna tartare for appetizers and they were just okay.  For our main entrees my best friend and I ordered the Lobster ""Au Curry"".  It was over cooked and chewy not to mention it looked like the chef had just found remnants of a lobster and threw them on the plate.  I shouldn't have to chew my lobster like its beef jerky.  In fact I'm pretty sure I've had beef jerky that has been more tender.   My boyfriend had the Sea Bass and it was completely flavorless and overcooked.  We also ordered two sides of the macaroni and cheese which was also completely overcooked.  Kraft macaroni and cheese is better than what they served us.  For a meal that was going to cost us close to $500 (they were gracious enough to comp us due to the fact that our appetites were lost since having to witness the vomiting - but don't worry, we tipped the server generously as this incident was no reflection on him) we were nothing short of disappointed and I think that's being kind.  In all honesty, I wouldn't even pay $25 for the meal we had.

My advice - go somewhere else. There are too many other wonderful restaurants in Vegas to have to suffer through this one.",C45JUbq5tM67qdBfCl0SiA,2,0,1,juWGVU6QWAMtGX_MragyDA

My favorite restaurant so far! My boyfriend works there, so we got a deal on all the food. The staff was nice and very professional, even though my boyfriend worked for the lounge side.

All the food was excellent. Small portions (since it is considered French cuisine), but we were full at the end. Since the staff knew it was a special occasion (our one year anniversary), they offered many items complimentary. Off the top of my head, we had the bison tenderloin, kampachi sushi, lobster, tuna tartar. etc. The Mac Cheese (which is called elbow pasta) is really good as well. Forewarning, there is a lot of butter used.  They also had a special martinis (from coconut and pineapple liqueurs). Wine selection was also great!

It was kinda a surreal moment.  I wished I knew that you could sit outside and have dinner.  The view is truly amazing.  The hotel overlooks the whole strip.  So romantic.  However, we ended up sitting inside.  They put us in this clam looking booth.  Yes, it looks like a futuristic booth with a ceiling.  I guess that is the best way to describe it.

Service - excellent.  We were originally seated in an uncomfortable corner and the waiter moved us to our clam seats... which had more room.  Also, the waiter knew his stuff.  We went with his recommendations throughout the dinner and were quite please with the results.

Food -- we had scallops for an appetizer.  It was awesome.  Then, we had this funky salad.  I would say that the dressing made the dish... don't know how to describe it though.

First of all, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Fantastic ambiance. The Lounge area is a Vegas absolute must and the main reason I'll probably return again and again. If I were to rate Mix based on the Lounge (view) and the decor, I'd have to give it 5 stars. 

Now to the food and service. The food is just okay. Not good... I promise you won't be blown away... not bad either. Just food on a plate that tastes okay. 

I ordered the lobster curry for my latest meal. It was lobster in a non-spicy, light curry sauce. Nothing fancy or brilliant about it. I probably could have done something better at home. 

I had the tuna tartare for an appetizer. It was very good... but again... something I could have easily created in my home kitchen. When I go out I'd rather be wow'd by wondering how the chef could have prepared something so wonderful. You won't find any of that at Mix. 

The service was good. We had two large tables and they serviced our needs quite well... though the meal probably took a little longer you'd expect, but they try to time everything just right.

This is pretty much how I'd summarize every meal I've eaten at Mix. Something you can easily prepare at home that tastes good but you'll pay a pretty penny for at a nicely decorated restaurant with good service. 

If you've never been there... I'd highly recommend at least checking out the Lounge area.

***sorry, I have to add a side note here.  Mix, update your cocktail menu!  The cocktails on the list are reminiscent of Sex and the City circa 1994!***

we decided to check out the wine list.  If you're not dining at Mix for a special occasion, you can get away with a $50 bottle.  It won't be great, but hey, when you've been working for 12 hours, who cares.  We settled on an unmemorable bottle of white.  

We started with the 1/2 portion of foie gras.  It was gigantic.  I kept wondering if they brought the full order because it was so big.  Definitely large enough for 2.  It was amazing.  

For the main course, I chose the braised wagyu en cocotte.  It was phenomenal.  The most tender and delicious meat that I've had since I can remember.  I don't think I even needed a knife.  I would comment on what my friend ordered but who the heck knows.  I don't think I even looked up from my meal to see.  It was that good.

At the end of the meal we were stuffed.  I don't think I was able to finish my main course but there's always room for ice cream.  We went with the homemade ice creams and sorbets - coco lime, buttermilk and butter pecan.  Worth every calorie.

To top things off, our server was cool and very professional.  He took great care of us.  It was a great way to end the work day.  I loved it!",j_xdpXxPdSVhlwTJ7roKag,1,1,5,Qn4TvsTnQYe42o7Q_g1Ukg

MIX is the second Alain Ducasse restaurant I've tried.  The other one was in Tokyo and it was decent but not special.  Occasionally, the food at MIX felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  The food tastes slightly better than nearby Aureole (and the service is better too), but MIX just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.

The Alain Ducasse name is definitely a draw for MIX, but the atmosphere is too.  MIX sits on the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay and you get a good view of The Strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  The dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  The lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.

MIX offers several menu options.  There is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several Prime steaks.  There is also a seasonal MIX tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of Alain Ducasse signature dishes.  I decided to opt for the Alain Ducasse tasting menu.

(Sweet corn soup amuse) The sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.

(Assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) The breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  The addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.

(Potato gnocchi, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) The gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and I prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  The asparagus was good.  The mushrooms were just okay, but I really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).

(Seared foie gras, date puree, lemon confit) I added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty foie gras.  The foie gras was not that good though.  It was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.

(Roasted Maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) The lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. The coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  It just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  And because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).

(Filet mignon rossini, foie gras, black truffle) This was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  The filet was decent.  It was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but I did not think the quality of the meat was great.  The foie gras was similar to the a la carte foie gras where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great foie gras (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).

The black truffle was not that great either.  It was probably Australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  This truffle part might be better in the winter.

(Mango puree) The first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  It was mango puree and a soda foam.  It was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.

(Baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) This was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  The sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  As individual parts, this dessert was decent, but I did not really love it as a whole.

(Madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  I liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  I wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  The chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.

Despite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  And because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.

I thought the service at MIX was very good, but the food was about the same quality as Mandalay Bay's other lackluster fine dining spot Aureole.  There is a lot mediocre fine dining in Las Vegas and, unfortunately, Alain Ducasse's MIX falls in that bunch.  If you are looking for better and more contemporary French dining, you should check out L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand instead.

AMBIANCE 
I came here to celebrate a birthday. It was in the middle of the week so it wasn't too crowded. Most people seemed to be town for conventions, conference etc. We entered through The Hotel, checked in and seated right away. We were seated next to the window with the perfect view of the strip. I believe they have the best view because its at the end/beginning of the strip. Decor has that modern, monochromatic Philippe Stark look. The crowd was more of the professional 30+ crowd. 

SERVICE 
We were greeted and seated right away and the waitstaff is professional, knowledgeable and best of all attentive. We never felt rushed or nor was there a lull in our service. Everything was timed perfectly. 

FOOD: 
AMAZING!! I went for the ""theatre"" tasting menu. We did start off with 2 different foie gras. One came with the tasting menu and we ordered another to taste a different application. We both decided that we like our foie gras seared. For the main course, my friend had lobster with curry sauce and for the tasting menu it was small plates of meat dishes. I actually didn't finish because it was a bit much for me. It was good, but can't eat much when you've been drinking.

I prob would have chosen the chocolate soufflé though if that had been an option on the prixe fixed menu.

Our server, Randy, only made the meal that much better. You could tell he works as a server, but he's a chef in his own right. He did an awesome job accommodating us, considering I got the prix fixe menu and my mom had an entree and side. He timed it right and was extremely knowledgeable about all the food.

Every single thing on the prix fixe menu was amazing. Every item was unique enough to make me think, and though I probably wasn't able to fully appreciate the presentation, it slapped me in the face with flavor I couldn't misunderstand. The lamb dish was the best I've ever had. Dessert kept coming...3 items that were ridiculously good!

My mom had the cod and it was a huge portion with unbelievable flavor. She had a $9 side with the cod ($36) and it was plenty of food. These prices are REASONABLE when you're on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay.

Randy took the time to explain that MIX is one of the few restaurants in Vegas that actually serves PRIME beef, pastured meats, and most everything is organic.

We only caught attitude from the hostesses. We still haven't figured out why. Perhaps it was because they were ugly. As a result of said ugliness, they were bitter about it. Otherwise, our server, the sommeliers, and foodrunners were down to earth. They all aided in creating the inviting atmosphere. Everyone was pleasant to us. 

The only problem I had was that the food I ate was not worth the $100+ a person. It was good, yes. However, it wasn't amazing.  If I am going to pay that much money for food, it better blow my mind.

I had to knock off a star because, honestly, our waiter was terrible, not just at this pricepoint, but even if he was a waiter for Applebees.  He was a nice guy and trying hard (I guess?) but he was shockingly bad, like, unacceptably bad at a place this nice.  I mean, he was comical... dropping forks, plates, bumping into fellow waiters, etc... multiple times.  I used to wait tables as a teenager and I was never so clumsy.

Anyway...

We had a reservation for 7:00pm on a weekend, we were seated promptly on the outdoor porch area, ordered some amazing apps.  We had a party of about eight, two of which didn't have water.  We had to ask the waiter a couple times for the water, which he kept forgetting.  We finally found the guy who gave us the bread (amazing variety) and he took care of it right away.  The waiter then went MIA.  We finally had the buser (the bread guy) flag him down and he came back over to take our orders around 7:30.  I only ordered a Diet Coke to drink (too tired for any alcohol).  He never brought it, went MIA again.  

We waited and waited and waited for our food.  Tables seated around us were getting their food and beverages before us even though they were seated long after we were, so I know the kitchen wasn't slow.  

We started walking around the restaurant and got talking to the manager, who was so ridiculously nice.  We were admiring the wine cellar and he took us in to show us, which was so cool of him.  That was definitely a really cool note of the night.  

We finally got our food, no joke, at 8:45.  That would normally be fine if people were getting their drinks filled and so on.  

Still no Diet Coke.  

The food arrived at 8:45, I reminded the waiter of my Diet Coke, he said he's be right on it.  I ordered the cod.  Uh-mazing.  Everyone's food was spot on.  We were starving so we 'enjoyed' our food a little more quickly than usual, done probably in 15-20 minutes.  

No Diet Coke still.  Our of principle, I told one of the busers that I ordered a Diet Coke which I never received... and I had it within a minute.  Top notch on that end.  

With all of that said, one terrible waiter couldn't deter an amazing nice of good food and conversation in a great place.  If we had any other waiter, it would be five stars.  I know for sure that other tables had top notch waiters, which is expected at a place like this.  Ours, unfortunately, was in way over his head.  

Paying the bill was the same thing... trying to track him down... waiting for the receipt to sign... then waiting for him to take it up.  We didn't get out of there until, literally 10pm.  

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Get away from the pretentious, overpriced places in the middle of the strip and enjoy a night out here, trust me on this - just avoid our waiter ;)",vXSw50X6SurDHp8MpOSvjw,1,0,4,_8qbsIny-cLcLgL9EEGkCg

It's like all these lookers just stepped out of a photo shoot for Harper's Bazaar. Even I had to sashay my way in here. Probably one of the few spots I'm lucky to have perused in this trip, Mix Lounge at THEHotel was a treat.

As you ride the elevator up to heaven (there were many floors), you immediately feel the sensual, trendy vibe of the place. It must be the evening neon lighting and candles everywhere...makes one feel like they've retired inside some lava lamp.

One of those meals where you savor every bite because you only have 1 or 2 bites to go but all had such a distinct taste that defines refined cuisine flavor. Cool spot to check out every once in awhile you're vacationing

The dining room was mod, Jetson-esque, breathtaking and swank.  I was impressed by the carefully strung glass globes and the white domed booths.  I felt like I was on another planet.  

The food is not cheap here.  To balance out the prices, the portioning is quite large.  An entree is definitely enough to satiate one's hunger.  

The bread basket is pretty impressive, with 5 types of bread, but sadly, most were chewy and cold.  The only one I enjoyed was the salty bread, which was similar to a croissant, nice and flaky.  The butter had an interesting twist, bits of peanut in the butter and also served was the standard plain version.  

Chef sent out an amuse to start our evening: a compilation of prosciutto, fig, Parmesan, and balsamic glaze.  The other components set off the sweetness of the grilled fig.

Normally the compliment of the Chef is a BITE, this one was a few bites, so I knew we had made the right choice not to order an appetizer, to save room for the main event and DESSERT!

The menu is extensive, catering to both the conservative and adventurous eater.  

I chose the Bison Tenderloin.  I would order this ten times out of ten over cow.  Lean, moist, tender, full of natural flavor, and ZERO gaminess.  It tasted like REALLY good COW.  Yum.  Came with a side of veggies, all of which were grilled and seasoned perfectly.  

It's important to have veggies FREE on the side.  

My compadres had:
Thai Snapper, standard, rice was excellent, but the fish was salty.
Duck, above average, but nothing special.
Roasted Maine Lobster, EXCELLENT, great contrasting textures and flavors.

Shared Side:
Elbow pasta, black truffle, ham, gruyre cheese-DELICIOUS, a bread crumb crust would have put it over the top.

The pastry chef has numerous accolades for his creations.  We were not shy about ordering:
Chocolate dome, mango chutney, passion fruit sorbet, a bit rich for my taste, but everyone else devoured it.
Chocolate Tea Tart, beautiful presentation, perfect for dark choc lovers.
Rhubarb coconut, light and the rhubarb was a nice departure from the standard fruit selections.

At the end of the meal fresh madelines are presented to the table, we were stuffed, but all of us managed to fit the buttery morsel into our mouths.  Nutella is provided with the sweet treat.  The BEST madeline I've had in my life, slightly sweet, right out of the oven, and crisp edges.  

After dinner we wanted to check out the famed lounge.  From the stark white of the dining room, to dark chocolates and reds, we were transported once again.  I was stunned by the creativity in the use of design and space.

1977937,2013-08-24,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"What a great disappointment! We were looking forward to trying the supposedly amazing French touch from Chef Ducasse at Mix, however nothing felt like a Michelin gastronomic restaurant. 
Apart from the view of the Vegas strip, this restaurant is truly a waste of money and time. Especially in Vegas where we have found some true gems. 

1. The service was almost inexistent. Our server was extremely pushy and tried to increase the amount of our bill. However, it was pretty obvious what he was trying to do. When asked what are some of the best recommendations, he stated: ""Well, first I would start with a glass of champagne."" In my head, I was thinking ""Dude, I asked you about the food!"" Then, he only recommended the tasting menu ($120 per person), without even mentioning the a la carte options. Apart from these two interactions, the waiter did not come see us at any time. 

2. Being familiar with French gastronomic restaurants and famous chefs (like Joel Robuchon), we were dying to see what Ducasse had in store at Mix. A serious lack of innovation and originality was what we noticed. My husband ate a cod that was not-memorable and I got the lobster curry. My dish cost around $50 and I swear when it arrived it literally looked like it had just been thrown onto a plate with no considerations for the aesthetics of the dish. Curry splashed all over, a mush of overcooked rice and just nothing that excites the eyes. While the lobster was abundant, the dish tasted like a curry dish I would have taken at a regular Thai restaurant (which would cost $10). I'm just glad we didn't try anything else. And those two dishes were supposed to be the top items that display Ducasse's ""genius"" abilities....

Overall, it might be best for Ducasse to take his name out of this restaurant. My husband and I are huge foodies and we have tried top restaurants in every city we have visited, but this one is definitely not a place we would come back!",Mums-t8RnaQm56eCM4_F6w,1,0,1,cdQeAFQI4zWI3_vHGxkR4Q

This is a 10 dollar cab ride from hotels on the main strip (bellagio/venetian/mirage/etc) but well worth it if you plan well. Be sure to tell them if you have a time limit because our food took forever to come out and it caused a delay in the rest of our evening.

Vegas has always been about the food for me, so on our latest trip we decided to try Mix before a night out. There were three of us including one vegetarian. We chose Mix because I had never been there before and heard the food and the views were stunning. I also knew it was a Michelin star restaurant.

The ambiance and dcor are quintessential new Vegas, over the top and elegant, not to mention the view from the 64th floor. I loved the glass fixtures hanging from the ceiling.

The server was good. He went out of his way to recommend a special dish that wasn't on the menu that he eats as a vegetarian for my friend. He wasn't perfect, though. At the beginning of the service he asked if we preferred still or sparkling water. I always thought still mean tap...apparently I was wrong. They brought out VOSS water and kept refilling our glasses without asking. We ended up being charged 30 dollars for water. Fine.

Dinner was great, but nothing I would run back for. I had a specialty pork chop and my wife had venison. Again, both great, but not worth a second trip.",44JQCzsDB6WuVVa2H3EPFg,1,0,4,-0gbDzYn0vmY8kd1fL7xlA

First, we were fortunate enough to have a table on the patio outside overlooking the strip.  This is absolutely the best view in town.  Even if you can't make it for dinner, at least get a drink at the bar. 

Our service was very good, all the wait staff were very polite and formal which I really appreciate when you're going out for a nice meal. 

Dinner was incredible. I had the tuna tartar, halibut, and one of the most incredible desserts Ive ever had.  I forget the name but it was pistachio and vanilla ice cream in a crunchy meringue shell with pistachios and raspberry sauce.

2011378,2012-11-26,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Came here for dinner, not the lounge portion, but if you want beautiful panoramas of the city I highly suggest you start here. But, be careful, they seem to be pretty snotty about outdoor seating even when the place is empty. Call ahead.

As for dinner, the restaurant is beautiful. You walk in and get instant visual stimulation. It's incredible. From the decor to the lights of the city all around, it really is just a place that draws you in. 

There were a few thins that happened that could have been avoided and this would have been a four star experience. The first incident was being seated in a cozy little nook where conversation could be had without being so close to the next person you feel like you're sharing family secrets. That didn't last long. The hostess immediately, in a bare, empty, no one-there restaurant, seats people right next to me and my date. Hello? That is beyond rude. I mean, the tables are so close together as to be really uncomfortable. To use the bathroom I literally had to wedge myself between my table and the one next to us. Awkward. Also, the waiter, when asked for my favorite Belgian beer tried to tell me they only carried one type. I had to insist that he go ask someone because he was wrong (for the record, Chimay comes in blue, white and red). 

Other than those two missteps everything was okay. The service was quick and flawless. The time between waiter visits was perfect. I had to ask for water just one time and after that I couldn't take a sip without it being refilled. So, great job of picking up on that. We were also greeted by several people on our way in which I thought was a very nice touch.

Onto dinner. For appetizers I had the dinner salad which was essentially a larger than average bowl of mixed greens. It was mixed with a vinaigrette of some sort that just added to the bitter taste of the overall salad. I wouldn't recommend. My date had the spicy crab salad which was delicious, but absolutely could have come from mom's kitchen. What can I say, my mom's a great cook! 

For an entree I had the 12 oz. boneless ribeye. It was cooked perfectly, but was much too large for me to eat so I brought the extra home. It was delicious. It did happen to be more of a fatty cut than I was used to, excessively so. It was fine, but I prefer less fat, more beef, obviously. For sides I chose the fork crushed potatoes. They were chunky and rich, but again, they could have come from my mom's kitchen. 

My date had the pepper crusted bison tenderloin and seemed to enjoy it. I dislike that much pepper anywhere near me, but it looked delicious. His side was sauteed spinach which he found delicious. 

For dessert I passed, but my friend had the ice cream/toppings. You get four choices of either and he chose pistachio ice cream, salted caramel ice cream and vanilla ice cream with coconut crunch as a topping. The pistachio was creamy and rich, I loved it. I could have done without the coconut, but really it wasn't a distraction. I disliked INTENSELY the salted caramel. It tasted very bland and very unlike any salted caramel I've ever tasted. I almost think that's a taste that belongs solely in candy form. I just don't think it translates well to other things, which isn't the fault of the restaurant, I've just never found that it works on much else but candy. As for the vanilla, well, it was vanilla. 

All in all the decor, charm and service were perfection. The food was so enjoyable although I didn't get the Michelin star experience, I don't think. The food really was good and the view was just beautiful. With all the restaurants in Vegas, though, I doubt I'll revisit.

Just as the restaurant, the view is breathtaking (64 floors up). I loved the fact that they had tables outside to enjoy the fresh air and the view. All the tables are open for everyone until about 10PM (or something like that) and then some of them are closed off for table service.

However, there is still ample seating, which was a total plus for me. The bathroom was another crazy feature. I liked the fact that one of the stalls has a glass wall to the outside! It's like your doing your business on top of the world (or at least that's how it feels like). hahaha The one thing I didn't like about it was that it's very close to the men's bathroom and if you're not careful (and especially if you're drunk) you can walk into the wrong one (no doors to the bathrooms).

So why the less than super enthusiastic review? Our waitress was a pill. It was only about 5:30 on a Saturday when we arrived, so the place was pretty chill, which a private party occupying most of the staff's attention. Four of us went out to the deck after being informed by the bartender it was open for seating (there was some confusion with signs and the such). We sat out there for a while, with no one coming by, and after seeing a couple walk out with drinks from the bar, assumed we had to order them ourselves. Okay, kinda ghetto, but whatever. Well, about 5 minutes later, a waitress shows up, and informs us of the happy hour special (1/2 off a good selection of cocktails - score!). But when we told her our friends were already at the bar ordering, her face soured as she clearly thought, ""Great, no tip. Thanks, assholes."" But dude, not our fault that it took 10 minutes to get any attention for a table of 4 in an almost empty lounge!

Worse yet, the bartender did not inform our friends of the happy hour special, so they spent $60 on slightly different variations of the 1/2 off drink specials. Sweet.

I had some friends in town for the weekend so we decided to go up to The Mix for some drinks and to check the view. We ordered a round from the bar and took a walk around to find a seat. 

We were promptly approached by a well dressed young gentleman by the name of Richard. He was presentable, professional and well spoken . He sold us a bottle of Grey Goose vodka in the VIP section of the balcony with the best view in the house. 

Not long after we were seated the bottle came out with all of the mixers of our choice. The lovely cocktail waitress Amber took care of us and was always on hand to make sure our drinks were topped up and to take photos. 

Richard dropped in and checked on our group periodically throughout the night to talk to us, make us feel welcome and make sure we were taken care of. An example of his fine Hosting skills came into play when one of my girlfriends felt a little cold. Richard went out of his way to get her a blanket to throw over her legs so she was comfortable. 

I can't say enough about the way we were hosted by Richard and actually treated like VIP's. It's subtle differences I noticed that made a big difference in our experience. From creating an atmosphere where we felt like we where special, important and comfortable to genuinely taking an interest in our conversations and catering to our needs, we were all very impressed to say the least 

Words got around about our experience. I now have some more friends coming into town over the next few months and have requested to hit up the Mix for a night out hosted by Richard. We will be back for sure!",cF4M9Mdn3x20NlaRcgq2fA,0,0,5,UYxzZxRxUHimXaZBTpeXPw

I don't like it anymore because, they blocked the patio so only the people with bottle service can sit in the patio. Bottle service can be from 300 dollar and up. Drinks are about 20 dollars. We were 6 people in our group and we were all planning to order drinks but they still didn't let us enter the patio. They insisted for us to pay 100 dollar to enter the patio which by the way was full of smokers. No thanks. I'm willing to pay for drinks in a nice bar but I'm not willing to pay 100 for a view of the Vegas strip. I can go to stratosphere, high roller or paris for a better view of the strip and the price would be cheaper and I wouldn't deal with smokers.",_D58DYa7Z_yR8flo80vkOw,0,0,1,NS8KxKgJdJiv4-67C9_6ug

The decor makes you feel like you're walking on air and the views of the strip are amazing. We are the family that doesn't let the fact that we have a child hold us back from dining where we want to on vacation. She's well-behaved and she's 9 but nevertheless, some places frown upon children and we never got that impression at all. The staff treated her exactly how we want her to be treated in a restaurant, in such a way that helps give her a chance to use her manners - they asked her for her order, not me or my husband, and treated her like any other diner. We were a bit nervous when an elderly couple sat next to us as we didn't know how they'd feel about being seated next to a family, but later on in the meal the woman told us she was completely full and asked if we minded if she offered for our daughter to try her souffle. 

To start, our family was served the Thai Coconut Chicken soup which was very good. I started with the shrimp cocktail which was absolutely delicious. I could have been done right there. Finished it off with the Maine Lobster Curry which I loved. My husband had the tasting menu and was in heaven. My daughter had the Macaroni & Cheese with ham side and that was perfect for her. Our waitress was lovely and we felt the perfect amount of attention and timing. We had everything exactly when we needed it.

We arrived about 15 minutes early to our 6pm reservation. After a nice trip to the top of THE Hotel in a glass elevator, we were sitting in the fantastic lounge that overlooks the Strip. The view is as amazing as everyone has said, and we enjoyed two very good cocktails which we then took over to our table when we were ready to eat.

The dinning room is a beautiful white with glass, contrasting the very dark lounge. We were seated on the outdoor patio, with the strip view accompanying our meal. It was a perfect night in the LV, no heat lamps were needed and it was a phenomenal setting.

Our server was extremely knowledgeable about food, and not just the food he was serving. He made great suggestions without trying to force particular dishes. Waters were regularly refilled and plates cleared in a timely manner. Great service.

We ordered a bacon, pumpkin and gnocchi appetizer. It was delicious, but I could have used a little bigger portion. Bread was tasty, especially with the house made peanut butter.

For dinner my wife ordered the scallops. She loves scallops and thought these were particularly good. I order the steak au poivre, which was heavily crusted in black peppercorns, accompanied with various veggies and cooked perfectly. Very tasty. The gruyere mac and cheese was also delicious.

For dessert were ordered the apple dish, Mix is known for its candy bar desert, but sadly I'm allergic to chocolate, so I had to settle for something else. The apple mulliere was tasty, but nothing life changing. I would say the best part of the dish was the green apple sorbet that accompanied it. 

Overall the atmosphere combined with some pretty tasty food ensures that I will be returning here. Two cocktails, an appetizer, a side, two entrees and dessert ended up being $177, but $50 was covered by the great deal on Restaurant.com. For $127 this was fantastic.

Even if the meal is out of your price range, I would recommend trying to make it up here for a cocktail and the view. One of my favorite of many, many experiences in Las Vegas.",pnpEztine7Ua82NPFDoieA,2,0,5,TE5YSehn0DFHqqmMakh7YQ
2100853,2014-09-16,2,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Hard to offer a review on this one.  The place is really quite amazing.  It is on the top floor of the Delano hotel, sort of a sister hotel to the Mandalay Bay. It feels like a hidden, out of the way oasis in the middle of the strip because it doesn't have a casino, the entry is from the garage for the Mandalay Bay and the place is just quiet and reserved.  The restaurant itself is striking, with views of the surrounding area and the minimalist decor making you feel like you are somewhere ""special"".  

What's the problem here... yeah, I'm not talking about the food.  We didn't order everything on the menu, but I thought we ordered enough to get a good feeling of the overall foodie experience and it's just not that special.  We started with the charcuterie plate which had various cuts, but I've had much, much better.  We also ordered the gnocchi appetizers.  This was the best plate we had.  The gnocchi are light and airy and not too dense and the light sauce doesn't overpower the simple taste of the gnocchi.  Great on that one plating, but nothing else came close.   We ordered the boneless rib eye and it lacked juiciness, taste, everything.  They provided sauces with it... and the steak needed the sauces.  That shouldn't be the case with rib eye.  The sauces weren't that good either, they lacked any real flavor, just bland.  

We ordered various sides, the fries, the asparagus, the mushrooms and, again, nothing stood out.  Very disappointing, the food just didn't live up to the atmosphere.",Xq6W2KM27mEBFJ7pgpFMmA,1,1,3,SxCdK6Z_VDhN7zdCdcNVjA

Once we were finally situated we ordered our food from a very staid boring waiter.  So far not impressed.  Soon we noticed time marching on and no sight of our food.  Suddenly we had a new waiter and a free appetizer a fantastic gnocchi with pumpkin.  The new waiter was attentive, fun and very informative.  The food finally came and it was FANTASTIC!!! I had the slow roasted pork loin and belly with grits.  My wife had the baramundi with an olive tapenade. Both great dishes, with a wonderful side of asparagus and the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted.    The new server was like a relief pitcher in baseball.

Came here for my friend's birthday and I ordered the ribeye, medium-rare. While all of us are waiting on our order, they had a great selection of complimentary bread.  Along with their variety of bread and biscuits, they had peanut butter (smashed peanuts in butter-really good) and regular butter.  Their service was impeccable- never had an empty glass of water and our waiter kept asking if everything was ok.  He knew we were in a rush to get out before a certain time so our food came out on time but...my ribeye was overcooked and the taste was meh. I felt like I could've grilled my steak way better than this. I wanted my ribeye to be medium-rare so it should be slightly bloody. On my plate, it was barely a drop of blood. Also, i'm paying $46 for just a piece of steak with one red pepper, how lonely is that?! They should've added some roasted veggies for the price people are willing to pay for. We also ordered the tuna tartar and it was less than mediocre. Their taro chips were too thin to actually eat with the tuna and the flavors just weren't there.

i wish i could review the food but sadly all we did was drink lol. We got in for free (guys too) for being hotel guests. Thanks Mandalay! money saved! Drinks were great, not watered down which helped our buzz! The crowd was a good mix of people; black, white, asian, hispanic, older, younger... as diverse as you can get. This isn't one of the clubs that get really crackin though. 

I blame that on the DJ.... so when we walked in i was really hyped to hear hip hop. for some reason i feel like hip hop and vegas never happens bc some douchebag will request geigh ass house all night. i dont have a problem with house music here and there but fist pumping???? god can we all get over that?! anyway the DJ was playing some good hip hop and R&B, dance floor was crackin then BAM.... CeeLo - forget you. UHHHHHH? who dances to that song?! Can you even dance to that song? so many ppl left the floor at that point... THEN the track up next was ""Aint no mountain high enough"". UHHHHH????! WTF?!  

maybe the dj did that on purpose bc i swear everyone went to the bar at that point to drink more. whether it's strategy or not... DJ please practice your playlist and see if YOU yourself can dance to that and if it hypes you up. lol. 

i definitely will come back here to chill if i ever stay at mandalay again. if you're staying at venetian or somewhere like cesars it's not worth the trip bc you'll find a better crowd at TAO or pure. if you're looking to relax and not get bombarded with people this is the spot to go.",Vd2kzU_GkhjmGIjZwhg-PQ,0,0,3,u-ty34qonZvHXkHDiYg8Sw

Even though we were about 15 minutes late checking in for our 9pm reservation (we had a hard time finding a parking space) and two of our party had not yet arrived, the hostesses were friendly and polite. They gave us the choice of being seated or waiting in the lounge. We chose to wait in the lounge, which had a fabulous view, and had a couple of delicious, yet pricey, drinks. Our friends didn't arrive until about 9:30, but we were seated promptly and waited on quickly. We did not have a strip view, but we didn't mind. The restaurant's decor was view enough for us, although we had a few very loud large parties seated nearby. Service was good throughout. We didn't ask many questions of our server, but she was friendly and polite. Our meal was served at a leisurely pace, which allowed us to catch up with each other.

The food: Delicious, yet very pricey. One of our dining companions, who is a wine afficicinado, commented that although they had quite a good selection, they were drastically overpriced. We ended up with a very nice Merlot ($160), however. 

We each ordered appetizers, and my husband had the winner of the group, a spicy grilled shrimp salad with a tomato and cheese base. I had the potato and asparagus gnocci ($28), which was also very tasty. For entrees, I ordered the curry lobster ($59), which was absolutely heavenly! It was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of curry in a flavorful sauce. Just enough coconut rice to add a bit of starch to the dish. My husband liked his salmon ($39), but said it was a bit too rare for his taste (he ordered it medium). One friend had the veal, which she loved, and her husband also had the lobster. 

For dessert, we shared the raspberry tirimisu($12), which was light, creamy, and delicious. It came served in a martini glass, which I thought was a nice touch. We also were given little vanilla muffins with a nutella/hazelnut/chocolate sauce, compliments of the chef. My husband and friends also had espresso, which they said was also very good, and I had a cup of coffee, which was also good. I found it interesting that we weren't given any sugar- only Splenda, Equal, and Sweet & Lo. I guess everyone who visits MIX is on a diet? 

After dinner, we went to the lounge, looked at the view, and danced a bit. Of course, the view was spectacular. The bathrooms in the lounge are quite an experience- a stall with a view! I don't think I'd enjoy it very much if I were any tipsier, however. As it was, I felt a little vertigo. After a few more dances in the lounge, we decided to call it a night. Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience. I was full, but not stuffed, and we had a leisurely meal with great friends.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,1,4,kp0kD1ue3CnOzjERpw6ANg

The view is awesome, with a wonderful panorama of the strip. The cocktail menu was ok but the drinks were a little too sweet. I couldn't stomach more than one and switched to beer. If you're seated away from the dance floor, the volume of music is not too loud which is great for being able to have a conversation. I just didn't love the mix of music. I think it's probably for people younger than me (and I'm under 30) based on the (few) people out on the dance floor. I did go up to the DJ to request some other music, and he said the establishment frowns upon playing hip hop music...but he did oblige us with some Biggie, 50 cent, and Dr Dre. As soon as he stopped playing that short little set it went back to Techno/Dance (I think? I don't even know how to classify the music), and we jetted out of there to catch the last 12:30 tram.

We were seated outside and fortunately the weather was warm...when it did get chilly there were plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. Located at the top of THE Hotel, the restaurant is simply decorated with a gorgeous bubble chandelier lighting as the masterpiece. The view of The Strip and Vegas all around is amazing. The lounge area is nice and mellow but both times I didn't have the chance to try it out.

We ordered the prefix menu which included the spicy crab salad, seared duck foie gras, seared diver scallops, colorado lamb loin and mix candy bar. We skipped the beverage pairing and ordered two bottles separately - a delicious and fruity sauvignon blanc by Honig and a merlot (forgot name). The food was outstanding, the first and second time. I particularly liked the foie gras, scallops and lamb loin. All prepared just perfectly. They even provided us complimentary dish at the beginning and a drink in the middle to clean our palette. The frothy, peachy drink was delicious...so yummy we asked our waiter to hook us up with another round which he was nice enough to oblige. The candy bar was okay...we all agreed they taste similar to a Kit Kat bar.

I thoroughly enjoyed my dessert of chocolate souffle, which was ever light, warm, and the perfect amount of chocolatey-ness. The pistachio ice cream complements the souffle perfectly. 

My cousin and I split the lobster ceasar salad, which was delish (we suspect there was lobster roe in the dressing...so delicious) but not worth the $26. 

I really liked the taste I had of the Lobster Curry. The cod was good too! Oh and the crab salad appetizer! 

The only off thing was the Grandpa's Hat dessert. It looks too perfect and when you destroy it, it loses appeal.

Being an avid top chef fan, when I saw monkfish with celery puree on the menu I had to try it..... I was so excited, but it turned out to be a disappointment --- maybe monkfish is just not my fish --- it tasted ok - but not ""special"" - I assume they cooked it well, it had the texture of umm scallops? its like a steaky fish.... the celery puree was well, tasted like celery --- for 50 bucks an entree, I was expecting to get a culinary boner

I tasted my friends' scallops (delicious) and veal (amazing) so I wish I had gotten those - do NOT get the salmon - it looked so ugly presentation-wise (had this beige sauce all over it and there was NO OTHER COLOR BESIDES BEIGE on the salmon)  and didn't taste that great - spend your 50 bucks on one of the ribeyes

The best part of my meal was the cauliflower soup amuse bouche they gave us for free at the beginning of the meal - it was one gulp of heavenly deliciousness

I can understand the menu prices based on the ridiculously expensive finishes (I have never encountered leather of the quality that was on the bench in a restaurant before), and the location of the restaurant itself, but, like everything else on the strip, I'd still say it's overpriced.

The service was also very good. I casually asked the waitress if the salt inside the croissant that came in the basket of five or so different breads was Hawaiian, judging by its pink hue. She said it was fleur de sel, but then came back after double checking with the kitchen to tell me that she was embarrassed that she had told me differently. I don't know where they got all these French speaking bussers. Does Ducasse fly them in? I don't think I encountered one non-French one all night...

The wine list was very nice, but I easily confused the sommelier and he decided it would be better just to let me try the two I was asking about. He also didn't want to question my thoughts on the pairing with my meal, but I'm not sure he realized I was asking for his expertise.

Despite the fact that I don't think I've seen one venison dish in this town that WASN'T prepared with berries in one way or another, my main dish was quite good. Excellent preparation, beautiful presentation, and you really can't beat a roasted black fig. Paired perfectly with the zin I ended up selecting.

The night view (it's only open for dinner) of the city and south end of the strip is pretty fantastic from both the dining and lounge areas, and the lounge includes an outdoor patio.

This 1 star Michelin-rated (in addition to other awards) dining experience offers a medium sized American/French based menu.

I enjoyed the roasted duck breast with fig as my entree.  It was tender, rich, tasty, and surprisingly filling for such a small portion.  This could also be a result of filling up on the (free) bread with butter and peanut butter that is included, and from boozing beforehand.

Reservations are strongly suggested.  Unless it's a slow night (which is not the norm), you're not getting in without them.  Also, plan on making the reservations many hours (if not days) before your dinner.  I've been denied on more than one occasion by procrastinating until the 11th hour.

Because it's Vegas, you can get away with moderately casual dress.  However, this is a very high end restaurant where dressing up would be more than appropriate.

Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athénée in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting ""peanut"" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Attentive and friendly service. Water nor cocktail glass was ever empty. 

Cocktails were delicious, ordered 3 different ones and loved each.

Food is 4 stars. Nothing mind blowing but perfectly prepared and seasoned apps and entrees. Both the Lobster and Crab salad apps are musts. Entrée was the Filet topped with a seared Foie Gras steak. It was excellent

2457953,2014-04-30,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Touting itself as French cuisine with an American influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of THEhotel in Las Vegas.

My first trip to Las Vegas was due to an IT Expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with miX being a regularly recommended location.

Some of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our Vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at miX for the first time.

From the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of The Hotel and offers a changing view of Vegas, to the stunning décor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the Vegas lights come up, everything at miX is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.

The staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an Alain Ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.

Between everyone at our table we sampled the following:
* Complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.
* We ordered Dungeness Crab Salad with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, Shrimp Cocktail with horseradish and Spring Baby Vegetable Salad with an herby basil dressing as Starters for the table to share.
* 2x Filet Mignon Rossini with foie gras & a black truffle sauce
* 1x Roasted Maine Lobster au Curry with basmati rice
* 1x Cod Brandade with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley
* We ordered Fork Crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) Potatoes, Creamy Spinach and Sautéed Green Asparagus as sides to share.
* Complimentary Madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.
* 1x miX Candy Bar with a textured coconut & lime sorbet
* 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries

The food was fantastic, but at miX prices I would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  

Everything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: 
* The Steaks were done exactly as requested, although the Foie Gras lacked the impact I was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate I've had (it was my first time trying it and I was a little underwhelmed)
* The Cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect
* The Lobster Curry was phenomenal

However, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.

The wines suggested by our Server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.

On the way out I noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a Vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium I don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.

I get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  This is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and I recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of Vegas.",2TeE-QxklSur_lHRpThSaQ,1,1,5,JoLVslazE9_pMlem8FblFw

I really had no expectations for this place other than seeing the pictures and hearing that the lounge next to it, had a spectacular view.  It is due to this, that I was surprisingly impressed.   We had a 6 pm reservation, but as they still were not ready to seat us, we went to the Mix Lounge to wait. The view was spectacular.  One of the best views at night, as all the lights from strip is so hypnotizing. 

Once we got seated, I was ready to eat, as I was famished.   My friend and I shared the duck confit and the seared foie gras.  The foie gras was so tasty and soft. It just melted in my mouth as I ate it.  The duck confit was also delicious, as you could taste the hint of truffles in it.  My entree was the braised bison with mixed vegetables and my friends the venison.  I really enjoyed the bison, as it was my first actually.   I was afraid that it would be dry, but ordering it rare really makes the difference.  We accompanied it with the sauteed mushrooms and their specialty ""elbow pasta with black truffle, ham and Gruyere cheese"".   I was happy that we ordered the ""mac & cheese"", as it was so good.  I haven't  eat ""mac & cheese"" for over 10 years, and this did not let me down. The ham really makes the dish.  It was so rich though, that we couldn't finish it.

Stuffed, I couldn't order dessert.   We both left the Mix with full stomachs as we dragged each other out only to gaze at the lite ""X"" by the elevator.  Yes, ""X"" does mark the spot here.",__05rytNjsye9MBhqB0DMA,0,0,5,CMTvUP9kpIU8RyQyi36Bfg

The limo dropped us off at their hotel (The Four Seasons, which oddly enough is situated atop The Mandalay Bay) so we could play with our dog for a little and open a few presents.   Soon after, my sister led the way to Mix, on the 64th floor of The Mandalay.  Between the superlative view, the glam decor, and Alain Ducasse as the chef, we knew we were in for a treat.

Our waiter, who bore a strong resemblance to Macklemore was friendly and described every item on the menu with gusto.  The five of us split a salad and the shrimp cocktail for our appetizers, and were impressed with the flavor and artful presentation.  I had the lobster for my entree which was served in a curry that was inspired by tikka masala.  Not only did a I receive a large, succulent, tender portion of my favorite crustacean but the coconut rice it came with was extraordinary.  

For dessert, we had a small gluten-free (my mom and sister have celiac disease) wedding cake from a local specialty bakery, but the restaurant had no problem with my family bringing it in.

As a treat, our waiter gave us five wristbands so we could go to the lounge with no cover charge, and watch the 7/4 fireworks.

The music was hard to dance with and the dance floor was very small.  Second is the fact that they have all the tables near the window marked as bottle service only.  So you can never get close to the window to enjoy the view, they don't even let you stand closer to the window.

As far as dining experience, the food is quite incredible.  I would definitely go with at least one fish dish.  From the classics, I had the chef's striped bass.  Even if it came without the squid/octopus and it's base, I would have still loved it.  Same goes for the halibut.  I find it amazing how the chefs can cook such a big piece of fish so evenly and so moist.  

Top the above dishes with the dungeness crab salad and some gnocchi, you will be quite satisfied and full.  Enjoy!

Why 4 stars?  The service is a bit casual.  The servers are pleasant, but the service doesn't equate to what the customer is paying.  Items are missing, the staff is not completely attentive.

The view was fantastic--we sat on the outdoor patio.  However, it was REALLY hot outside and there was no A/C or fans outside to alleviate the 90-degree heat.  There was a newlywed couple sitting next to us, still in their wedding clothes, totally sweating.  I wouldn't want to eat in 90 degree heat for my wedding dinner.  I'd think a restaurant of this caliber might at least have some sort of solution to the heat.  

The food was just OK for the price.  I liked the appetizers we ordered (blue fin tuna tartare and Vitello Tonnato) more than the main dishes (Duck Breast and Pan Seared John Dory.  The duck breast was chewy and sliced a little too thick, thus enhancig the chewiness.  The fish was very overcooked and even--gasp!--dry in parts...which is not the texture I expect in a $46 fish filet.

We shared the tropical souffle for dessert and it was delicious!  The coffee was really good too.  But, not enough to redeem the dry fish and chewy duck.

I also feel that the menu options were rather limited...and if you're not going to offer that many dishes, then at least make sure the ones you do offer are well-executed.

It was not packed and we got a great seat with an awesome view easily, but were then ignored by the cocktail waitress for a good 30 minutes, even as she served all of the tables around us. We decided to go to the bar, and it took another 15 minutes to finally get a drink in our hands -- a $14 vodka and ginger ale! I understand charging high prices for martinis and complicated concoctions, but soda with vodka? Oh my. We went back to our seat and when our drinks were empty, we were again ignored for a lengthy period by the waitress. We flagged her down and she was quite rude and said she would serve us but it was last call (this was around midnight and the bar was half full still). She brought us back our vodka and ginger ales but this time had charged $18 each. We asked why and she said she didn't know how to charge for ginger ale so she had made it up, and said she would fix it if we wanted. We had to point out the bartender who served us (there was only one guy working though, so what the???) so she could check out our story with him and find out how to charge for ginger ale.  She did fix the bill, but was pretty jerky about it. Then, at 12:30 the manager came around to all of the tables (about 10 tables full of people at this point) and politely asked us to leave so his staff could go home. (So it really isn't open until 2 every night as listed here on Yelp.) I guess we should be thankful that service was so painfully slow and snooty, because we would have bought several more rounds in the 3 hours we were there, spent a lot more money, probably would have come back again and spent even more money, would have recommended it to our friends who would have spent a bunch of their money, too.

The Gnocchi was delicate, fluffly, and almost chewy a great choice. The spicy crab and tuna tartare were good alternatives for starters as well.

For dinner, I had the dry aged rib eye and it was soo tender.  It comes with sauces, bordelaise or many others - but i didnt use them - no need.  The Beef cheeks (waygu) were slow braised in a rich wines sauce that was dark and complex - really delicious but very rich.

We ate at lots of well rated restaurants-  Mon Ami Gabi, Red Square, Nine Fine Irishmen, Fleur, Verandah, and Ri Ra to name some.  Of all the restaurants this one was over the top pretentious FOR NO REASON.

During our mid week October stay we had reservations at several of the above mentioned restaurants.  It was unnecessary as there weren't many people in Las Vegas.  When we arrived at Mix without a reservation we were told they don't accept walk ins.  (Very rudely).  Then we went back to our hotel room in Mandalay Bay and called.  My husband was told that they were booked for the entire night.  I logged onto yelp and booked a table through Opentable.com that was 7 minutes later.  We walked right back.  The same hostess seated us.  Silly!!!!

The waiter was overly chatty and not very attentive to our needs (vegetarian, gluten free).  Even to the point not to tell me there was HAM in one of the breads they bring to the table.  My husband had a steak and asparagus.  I had the gnocchi.  Neither was anything special at all.

Let me just say first that it's not cheap.  But who cares, after you finish dining there, you will be so satisfied that every dollar spent was worth the experience.  The restaurant is so elegant and gorgeous.  We ordered the Ham Mac & Cheese, Potato Gnocchi, Seard Duck Foie Gras, Roasted Main Lobster with Basmati Rice & Beef Tenderloin top with seared foie gras.

The foie gras with chicken was good, but too much chicken.  The filet Rossini lacked sauce and was overcooked and a bit dry,  the lamb was so over flavored on the crust that only the center was tasty.  Excellent buttery potatoes and creamed spinach, the asparagus was good, but tasted mostly like butter..

The desserts were the most disappointing - the profiteroles were fair and the chocolate soufflé dry, lacking in chocolate flavor and inedible (left almost completely uneaten, complained about and still charged).  The Madeleines were cute, but too dry and cakey, lacking the buttery-lemon flavor of true Madeleine fame (my Wife's are much better).

Service was about the same as the food.  The Sommelier was competent and the Turley Zinfandel excellent, although our waitress managed to spill some while pouring due to her seeming indifference.  We had an early dinner and the room was empty most of the time with too many servers per patron. At times they were overly anxious, at times good and at times intrusive - certainly not first rate.  You shouldn't clear one diner and not the table, but that wasn't the way things worked here.

It seemed like a new venture that hand't yet worked out the kinks, but hearing they'd been open for several years they have no excuses.

Lovely space, good view, have a drink, but forget the food, until they get serious about being a real first rate restaurant.  When a big name chef adds his name to a restaurant, I'd expect his continued involvement or at least a higher level of quality control.  His name now just means high prices.  He should learn from Thomas Keller and the French Laundry.

I'd say maybe half the tables were filled at the busiest hour of the night, and this is on halloween. There's a small dance floor that was lifeless for most of the night despite the awesome DJ.

Spectacular view of the strip and what's best about it is unlike any other venue I've seen at high altitude in Vegas, you get a great view indoors thanks to the window pane which extends the entire wall facing the strip. This is great for those nights when the weather isn't so good. You can also stand out in the balcony if you like as well. 

The vibe inside was great, a little bit of an older crowd, I'd definitely recommend  this place to those in their 30's and up. DJ did a great job in playing music for the crowd.

Last November for my big 30th birthday I and several of my close friends came to Vegas to celebrate.  They surprised me with a birthday dinner reservation at the well known Mix.  This restaurant is located at the top of the THEhotel (on the 64th floor!!!!) adjoining Mandalay Bay.  What this means is that the view is OUTSTANDING because it faces the entire strip.  Outstanding or maybe breathtaking?  Hard to say which one.  This restaurant is truly stunning.  Example:  your view of the strip is a complete 360 thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows, which are everywhere including the bathroom.  Make sure you visit the bathroom!

Let's start with the 24 foot chandelier that has literally 15,000 hand blown glass spheres.  Beautiful.  The entire interior is chic modern, and almost glows like the sheen you see on bubbles.  Attached to the restaurant is the lounge, which has an open deck facing the strip where you can get the best views.  

Next, the food:  exquisite.  World famous French chef Alain Ducasse is at the helm at Mix and he does not disappoint.  Most everything here is French based, and our table partook in all the high points of the menu from the soups to the steaks to the foie gras.  (And for the record yes I felt guilty eating foie gras).  There is nothing on this menu that you could order and not love.

Mix was kind enough to let my friends bring over a birthday cake from Freed's bakery and they cut up the cake and served it for us.  Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable.  This is a must place to eat and see the views when in Vegas.",cST8Zaw_m73cMYPYA1m1cA,5,4,5,JZYupntNC82213SGpi_y7Q

When we finally got upstairs there was no one in sight. We wandered around the backside of the bar to watch the sun set and found the staff still in their pre-opening staff meeting. The manager politely indicated they would be with us as soon as they were through. i.e. Go away, you'll get a drink when WE'RE ready.  I let him know we'd be outside when they were done.  

Unfortunately, the patio is on the wrong side of the building to watch the sun set - but I guess we're there to see Vegas, right?

Eventually one of the waitresses sauntered out.  I ordered a glass of Scharffenberger champagne.  It was a surprisingly reasonable $13.  Their other by the glass champagnes are higher-end and French with prices reaching $30.  Their cheapest champagne is $12 - one from New Mexico?!?  I've had it before and it wasn't pretty.   Gruet is served everywhere in LV, and I mean everywhere!  Sorry, New Mexico, but I have rules while in Vegas!  

Las Vegas rule #5: no champagne from New Mexico!

This place is BAD. So, so bad. It is located atop The Hotel so you would think, okay it might be not-so-great food but I'm sure a great view. Surprisingly NOT. There is a view on one side of the restaurant, yet for some reason the hostess decided to seat everyone at the opposite side of the restaurant. Whatever.

So this is supposed to be Alain Ducasse--what a travesty. I was almost inspired enough to write a letter to let him know of the horrible representation of his name. Just makes me think of him as yet another snobby money-hungry chef who plops his name on any proposition with zero accountability. No offense, Mr. Ducasse, but seriously I don't understand how anyone whose opinion mattered would walk away from a meal here thinking differently. 

For everyone, please steer clear. You MUST steer clear. The food is HORRIBLE. I mean, not even par to a dinner off the strip or at Rio. I've never been to Rio, but it's all I could think of that reflects how disgusted I am with this place.

I ordered the crab salad for an appetizer and the halibut for dinner. The crab salad was very tasty and had a some spice to it. I specifically ordered the Halibut bc it said it was saffron infused, and anything and everything saffron makes me happy. Unfortunately for me the halibut was too salty. I was grabbing water wherever I could for the rest of the night. Ordering sides here is a must. Amongst all the sides we ordered creamed spinach was the tastiest :) 

They also brought out mini (I think it was bacon/asparagus) soups for us ""compliments of the chef"" so that we could ""open our pallets"", nice! 

Service: Very v-e-r-y s--l--o--w. I like it when I'm out with a significant other, it lets you enjoy your meal to the fullest, BUT we were there for a bachelorette party heading out for some dancing after wards, maybe the waiter can tune into how the vibe of each table is rather than a ""one size fits all"" service? 
Also my halibut came out later than everyone else's bc apparently it fell apart in the kitchen right before they were coming out with it and the Chef didn't like the presentation. Sure I was hungry but I liked that the Chef cared that much, plus they brought out an additional appetizer for me to enjoy while I waited. Thoughtful/Attentive +1! 

SO my one and only complaint. We called during the afternoon to make reservations at Mix. It being our first choice on where to go eat we were bummed that they told us they had no room to take an 8:00pm reservation. We began calling around literally everywhere around Vegas for dinner reservations (we were there during fight weekend so it was really difficult to land any) we did finally find a place to eat but we still wanted to eat at Mix bc a friend spoke highly of it. My sister came up with a little idea that we call back and tell them that we already had reservations and that we were calling to confirm (sneaky sneaky!) At first they told us we were not within their books, but that they would be happy to put us in. COOL! so I'm thinking they're probably slammed and they somehow squeezed us in and just for that they got a plus one star from me. BUT when we got there, literally 10 tables were wide open and for the remainder of our dinner there were PLENTY of tables still open. I immediatly took back my +1 point and felt that they were shady with their reservation service. Why would the girl over the phone tell us they had no space when there was tons? Very weird and strange. I didn't like that at all.

I ordered their duck, probably the best duck I've ever had in my life. My plate had two duck breast, the skin was perfectly crisp and I ate the entire plate, the presentation was exquisite. My boyfriend ordered the tuna tartar, another winner, again probably the best tartar I've ever had, mind you I've had my fair share of fine dining. We ordered the mushroom friasse as a side, wow, delicious, different array of mushrooms together, we throughly enjoyed our dinner there.

Normally whatever dessert you order they write happy birthday on it. Oh did I mention the pretty dining room we dined in?

We started with the Charcuterie Sampler that had these nice Italian hams and sausages cut thin. This dish paired well with my New Castle beer!

Then I had the Cod Brandade that was cooked perfectly; the fried parsley added great texture. One of the best Cod dishes I have ever tasted. My girlfriend had the Seared Tuna that was perfectly seared, that dish was very good too. And through out our party I had the chance to taste a few other items that were all very good. Like the Braised Wagyu that just melted in your mouth, Mac and Cheese w/Ham was creamy and salty (in a good way) from the ham, Wild Mushrooms had a nice gravy, and  the John Dory (fish) had huge flavors in a light dish. 

And in the end we had a great chocolate Souffle; one if the top 5 I've ever tasted!!

My bill was around $240.00 that included one starter, three main courses, two sides and one chocolate Souffle in the end. I had three beers and the two girls had only water. It was all worth it. 

I gave it four star because our waiter had this dry humor that just doesn't come across well when you are pay top dollar for a great dinning experience.

I order a very boring appetizer: shrimp cocktail, but man that was no ordinary shrimp cocktail. It is so refreshing, and the sauce they made was so good.
For main course, i ordered the lamb loin which was sooooo delicious too. The favor of the lamb is so refined and you wount find that bad lamb smell. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was so tender. The layered potato was such a great plus as well, and there was even a lamb stuffed chili which was unique and flavorful.

First off, the glass elevators that takes you up has an amazing view. It's a little scary but worth it. There is a 10 person limit so beware.  My friend works here and she said she has gotten stuck on the elevator before. And all you can do is wait until it starts working again. That's kinda scary especially when you're so high up and can see how high up you Are.

There's the restaurant and then there's the lounge. We decided to just hang out in the lounge. The restaurant has an angelic white theme where as the lounge is more dark and mysterious. Both have a section to be seated outside on the balcony. That is the ONLY way to be seated. You have to seat outside it has the most amazing view of the Vegas strip. Amazing! Romantic! 

For foods:
Big Eye Tuna TarTar-- amazing! it has such a refreshing taste. The chips were pretty flimsy and break easily so make sure you use a fork to put it on the chip instead of using the chip to pick up the tuna tartar. 

Mix N Roll-- I could eat that all day! It is a lobster roll sandwich with the most amazing burst of flavors. The bread is not too soft so it doesn't move around a lot. It comes with fries too. MUST GET. Amazing!

Cheeseburger sliders-- these were very tiny cheeseburgers. Also comes with fries. Nothing really special about them but none the less still good. 

Mini short rib tacos-- I actually wasn't too found of the tacos but everyone seemed to like them.

For drinks of course I got myself a Moscow Mule, amazing as always. 

The foods at the lounge are like Tapas, very small plates so if you come with an appetite I suggest the restaurant OR order a lot of plates at the lounge.

Located in Mandalay Bay, my friend Dj Icy Ice was spinning the Pacquiao after party here so we scored free entrance and no wait in the line.

This place has more of an intimate setting, which is a great if you want to take a break from the crazy clubbing.  Cool vibe, decent size interior, dim ambiance and the best part an awesome view of the strip from the 64th floor.  Outside there is a small patio.  Inside, there is a small dance floor, the bar and some seating.  We were able to snag some seats but I think most of it is reserved for bottle service.  The music was awesome, a few dj's rotated and mixed a lot of hip hop and old school beats.

Another cool thing about this place is it's both dressy and casual.  Casual meaning maybe a pair of jeans and a cute top, not your juicy velour suit.  Guys were wearing jeans, a t shirt with some cool kicks. Didn't see a bunch of drunk skanks falling all over the place or shady guys all up in our faces, so that was a plus.

Which means that Mix is worthy of greatness.

It's a ballad in of itself

Largely the reason for the delay of this review.

I was...

Afraid I wouldn't do our dinner right, and would smear the experience with buzzy cliches and ""OMGS.""

Afraid that it wouldn't come out right. It wouldn't sound as fabulous. As bold. And as perfect as it truly was.

But with Wendy Rene and Rihanna's Take A Bow as the sound rack of this review - I just have to go for it.....

..........

With cascading class bubbles, smooth buttery leathery booths, and a view along the way to the bathroom that will make your knees weak, Mix is a breathtaking splurge. 

Service is impeccable. Our waiter's descriptions of the menu was  spoken word. You could feel his passion for the food, burning him, as his dazzling analogies sprung from him. 

We felt like tanned queens, as we shared stories about the Bay area with the staff, while we sampled a menu that sang of a kitchen that you just knew was impeccable, where art happened every day, and in which chefs breathed life into meat, vegetables, and sponge cake with a deep belly love that managed to capture their ""natural"" essence.

Their rich flavors. Their vibrant colors. Their smooth textures.

Part of me longs to recommend dishes, but Mix is too exciting. You need to explore the menu on your own.  Listen to the waiters' share their own personal favorites.

2916472,2013-05-07,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"An update is in order for my review of MIX.

First-The manager of the restaurant cared so much about the negative review that he actually tracked me down at work, spoke to me, and insisted that we give the restaurant another try.

I'm glad we did.  I went in with my parents, and we were blown away by the meal and the service we got.   Sebastian, the manager, was terrific.  Bianca, our server, was as good as it gets.

Before people say that we were treated well simply because of a negative review, I will say that I was actually watching the tables around us, and I have to say that everybody seemed to be getting great service!

Now the food-honestly, it was like I was in a different restaurant.  We started with Shrimp cocktail.  This was served in a pretty unique way, more of a small salad with shrimp mixed into it.  At the bottom of the bowl was a horseradish custard.  The dish was outstanding.  My father got a plate of sliced meats of different type (I forgot what it's called) and he loved it.

Because I was unhappy with the Tuna I had for an app last time, we were brought out a portion to try.  Once again, it was like a different dish.  The tuna had a great spice to it, and the veggies underneath were very crisp.  THAT""S what tuna tartare should be like!  It was great.

We also had the Gnocchi appetizer.  Once again-it was outstanding.  Terrific mushrooms, Gnocchi, and vegetables, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It was delicious.

For mains, we got the Surf and turf (Chicken breast, with lobster), the Bison fillet, and a beef filet.  SImply put, each dish was amazing.  The Bison was so tender you could almost cut it just with a fork.  My dad got the Beef filet, and the fork mashed potatoes.  As soon as the waitress put the potatoes in front of him, I said ""Dad, that looks like a different dish than the potatoes I got last time"". And I was right, because these had seasoning, butter, and were delicious! Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.

For desert, we had vanilla bean ice cream, the cheesecake, and a ""Deconstructed apple pie"".  We loved every bite.

I've come to realize that any restaurant can have a bad night.  The food and service on the second trip MORE than made up for it.  I will say, I was shocked to hear from the manager after the first visit.  The effort he put in to track me down and be sure we had a great experience was incredible-there should be more restaurant managers like Sebastian here in Vegas.

Not only will I be back again (as will my parents), but we've already relayed this story to several of our friends who are going to be trying MIX.

The decor and the views are amazing. You come here for that, rather than the food. Not the the food is bad, it's just pretty expensive. Apps are around $30 and entrees are in the $50 range.

The lounge doesn't charge cover before 10, so you get some of a trailer park crowd before then. 

As usual the dishes are rated 1 - 10, 10 being amazing.

$12 Chivas
Good pour and quick service

$0 Bread Basket (6)
Nice variety, warm and fresh. Comes with hard butter and peanut butter. The peanut butter just doesn't work.

$33 Foie Gras, Apple (6)
If you like foie gras, this was a decent choice. My friend had never tried foie gras and liked it. Nice thick cut.

$28 Gnocchi, Morels (8)
I was pleaantly surprised by this dish. I heard it was bland. I thought it was great.

$52 Bison Tenderloin (4)
Nothing special, such a straight-forward steak with a peppercorn sauce.

$75 Beef Tenderloin, Foie Gras, Truffle (5)
One of the special of the night. Basic preparation with expensive ingredients. It was decent.

$44 Seared Tuna, Carrot (4)
Nothing special. I wouldn't order this dish. It's just seared tuna.

$51 Rack of Lamb (5)
The lamb was prepared well, but again nothing special and very straight-forward for $50.

$59 Beef Tenderloin (4)
Not sure how they priced this one. Same story, good straight-forward dish, but you're really paying for the decor.

$55 Halibut, Foie Gras, Truffle (5)
This was my pick. The halibut was ok, a little bland, but was made up by the foie gras and truffle sauce. 

$12 Elbow Pasta, Guyere, Ham (6)
It's hard to go wrong with this dish. It was good, but I don't go to a nice restaurant to get mac 'n' cheese.

$12 Forked Potatoes (3)
Just plain expensive for potatoes and butter. Not that good.

$77 The Cake (3)
The didn't make the cake, but to cut it and throw some ice cream on each slice, they charged $7 a person.

The service was great and very attentive and friendly. As it should be for the large group  20%. 

Overall, good place to celebrate a special occasion and hang out at the lounge afterwards. But, there are better places in a Vegas for the food, especially at these costs.",VDTvXteVDWfWtKyXCnFY3w,4,0,3,SgROb2jp8Ozlo2tRw3P_ow

The elevator to Mix restaurant and lounge was scary, it was meant for dining people to see some amazing views on the way up, too bad I am scared of height. Passed through Mix lounge, lovely host girl let us choose a window booth or a bird nest booth, was it a bird nest? Or half egg shell? Either one I guess, I liked the bird nest, it was more private, comfy and fun.

We brought our own Perrier JOUËT champagne, our server put it in the ice to cool it down. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop martini to sip on while we were looking through the menu, very clean and simple menu, I could tell every single item on the menu must be so good. And I was right, the dishes we tried were AMAZING! 

Starters: 
Complimentary bread basket: assorted breads with butter and peanut butter, very delicious, loved the peanut butter! 

Shrimp cocktail: non traditional shrimp cocktail, it was like a salad, jumbo shrimps were so fresh and tender, they tasted so good with the tomato sauce on the bottom, the sauce was so flavorful and delicious! 

Broccoli soup: clean flavor, with a hint of cheese in it, it was yummy. 

Entrees:
Lobster curry: one of their signature dishes, our server's favorite, he said he didn't even like curry, neither am I, but the curry flavor was fantastic! It was not heavy, just rich and flavorful, small amount of coconut to add a hint of spice, tender lobster meat with exotic flavors, it was MAGICAL, I loved it so much! 

Filet mignon with jalapeño pepper: the first cut came out overcooked to medium, they changed another one for hubby, the second one was a perfect medium rare, bloody and juicy, exactly what hubby liked. The red wine sauce was so good, the jalapeño was extremely spicy, server said it was from Santa Monica, most of them aren't spicy, guess hubby just got lucky to have a super spicy one on his plate, but both of us love spicy flavor, we didn't mind. Hubby loved his steak so much. 

Sautéed mushrooms: with housemade creamy sauce, delicious mushrooms, the flavors were so strong. 

From appetizers to entrees, the food was amazing! The flavors were heavenly delicious! Chef worked magical exotic flavors on each dish, how did he do that?! Just WOW!

Drinks:
Our Perrier champagne was so tasty, loved it, the raspberry lemon drop was strong and yummy, Chef's complimentary coconut and passion fruit soufflé was very very tasty, I usually don't like coconut flavor, what happened that night, how did I come to like curry and coconut flavors? 

After so much rich and flavorful food, I had no room for desert, the portions were big, both hubby and I got so full. Chef made us mini cakes with hot fudge as a little treat, just to apologize for overcooking hubby's steak, they were yummy. Hubby had double shot of espresso to finish this lovely dinner, I had the rest of the champagne by myself as usual. 

Definitely one of the best dining experience I have ever had for a very long time! The restaurant was beautiful, the views were amazing, the food was spectacular, the service was flawless, it was just PERFECT! Worth every penny of the $300 tab! The cork fee was $35. 

Mix has just become one my favorite restaurants in Vegas, along with Comme Ca and Circo. I think I've just had my next Vegas trip dinner dates lined up, that's awesome! 

Ps. The lounge next door offers champagne bottle service on the patio, it's a great place to enjoy the night views of Las Vegas while sipping on champagne, very romantic and relaxing.",-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,12,9,5,EAMIrmeyZb9xVNBpJT68Yw

As far as food goes, I had halibut and it was pretty bland despite the waiter recommending it over the barramundi.  His claim: the barramundi is very plain and the sauce has little flavor.  If that's the case, they could probably serve you water with more flavor.

Another guest in my party ordered the crawfish appetizer.  Despite my warning, she didn't believe me when I said it might come with the heads attached.  Well, I was about 1/3 correct .... only one of three came with a face.

A couple other people ordered the buffalo steak and it was great.  Of all the items ordered, this is the only one that had no complaints.

At the end of the night, two of the people eating with us were sick at their stomachs (and no, we weren't drinking).  You get free admission into the lounge with dinner.  All in all, Mix is a place not worth visiting.",Ei6VvLWS8jwknKmHSGLoUQ,0,0,2,wSivjUedHG5p9jJcXwSNLA
2958029,2012-10-15,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"As stunningly beautiful as it is, eating at Mix is kind of like eating in an airport terminal or a shopping mall. The high ceilings and glass and granite surfaces create an echo effect, so every sound reverberates off the walls and floors and just makes for an unsettling dining experience.

Acoustics aside, the food was pretty decent, although not quite as impressive as we had hoped. The best dish of the evening was the Spicy Crab Salad. Elegantly presented on a bed of guacamole and topped with shredded heart of palm, it was lively and fresh and made you feel like you were at a resort in Cabo. The Cod Brandade was acceptable, but I was expecting exceptional. The lemon and capers just weren't enough to brighten up the bland brown butter sauce and the soggy fried parsley. And the Duck Breast was so forgettable that I simply forgot what went with it.

We were very impressed, however, with the wine service. We didn't want to order a bottle, so we just asked the somm to pair our dishes for us. He seemed to enjoy the challenge and was a delight to talk to.

One last note: I realize there isn't much the restaurant can do, but people really should not bring young children to these kinds of places. It's inappropriate and inconsiderate to your fellow diners -- especially so at Mix because the sound of your rug rats squealing and shouting gets amplified throughout the entire restaurant.",cWVsDzn7L7dwL9c5tubwaQ,2,3,3,fz1DHrk95Ab7e2GYu7KR5A

I hosted a party for 25 in the club early in the evening, from 6-8pm. Best to get there early before the little 30somethings arrive. I had worked with the kitchen a few weeks before, selected 9-10 apps and desserts to be passed by servers, with a hosted bar for all drinks. 

First, the service was impeccable. 3 girls, very pretty and super friendly, along with a nice and knowledgeable guy behind the bar. Food came out at a very reasonable pace, and no one went hungry. 

Second, food was amazing. Highlights included black sesame tenderloin beef on mini-skewer, and Ducasse's stunning shrimp cocktail with horseradish panna cotta. Really delightful, flavorful and perfectly executed. Nothing was old, wilty or less than perfect. 

Third, amazing pricing. 2 grand for food, liquor and views for 25 people. Couldn't do better if I cooked the stuff myself and rented a suite. 

The secret is to pick the earlier hour, before the disco dollies have even left the pool, and be kind to all the service people you meet there. Attitude begets attitude, and believe me these workers see a lot of it in Vegas. Hopefully the club kids will all flock off to the Palms or some other MTV-like horror and leave this place alone.

The potato gnocchi with mushrooms had a tasty, earthy, smokey flavor to it. It was a very unique dish. I had the scallops topped with american caviar for the entree. I'd say scallops taste like scallops, but the caviar added a hint, aroma and taste of the sea. The ribeye was well-prepared -- it was cooked even all throughout with the done-ness done accurately. It had a good sear and crusty char on the exterior which I like. It was tender like prime steak should be.

2983742,2010-08-14,4,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Mix is on the top of The Hotel at Mandalay Bay on the 64th floor.  It has an awesome view of the strip especially at night.  There's a restaurant and also a lounge.  
First, I have to admit that I am not a fan of Las Vegas.  I don't gamble.  Can't stand the casinos and the all you can eat buffets and the people it attracts (not meant to offend anyone, sorry!).
Came here for the weekend with a couple of great friends of mine for a quick getaway.  We wanted a place for light appetizers, cocktails and then dance.  Well Mix was the place for us.
It was convenient since we were staying at the Mandalay Bay which is adjacent to The Hotel, where Mix is located.
We got free admission passes walking through the casino to Mix.  Score!  When we got to the top of the 64th and exited the elevator, the view was just breath taking.  Awesome view of the Las Vegas strip with all the neon lights and nightlife below.  You can also step outside to the patio to take in the spectacular view.  But since I'm afraid of heights, I passed.
Some of the specialty drinks were half price, taking it down to $8-9 / drink!  Score!  But by the end of the evening, we had 12 cocktails between the 3 of us.  So we were feeling no pain when we got the bill.
For appetizers we ordered 2 orders of the short rib slammers, crab mango salad (which was recommended) and ahi tuna stack tacos.  All 3 appetizers were awesome.  
After we got sauced up a bit, we hit the dance floor, which is on the smaller side.  But it was still fun.  The DJ played some 80s and some disco tunes which brought more people to the dance floor, which was a blast.  But then when the techno rap stuff started, then the floor cleared. We asked him to play the B52s ""Love Shack"", but said he already did the 80s earlier.  After tipping the DJ $20, he played our request!  You would think since the B52s were playing the following night at the Mandalay Bay Beach that he would've obliged to play our request without the $20 tip! Geez!
Anyway, it was a fun night out dancing.  And the B52s and Blondie concert the following night was awesome!",8A4Xbr9SUkNqoZ54GFDTAg,4,4,4,ODHVa_6aBtD7iM1tie5PrQ

3021442,2010-01-17,6,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"MIX was a bizarre amalgam of confusion and surprises.

Call me retarded but I never even knew that they had a restaurant in this joint.  I've been up to the lounge many times but was unaware that if you wound your way to the back, there was a large dining room.  Well whaddyaknow... the things you learn when you're not being a pissed drunk cocknozzle and stumbling into the 61st floor elevator ""to check out the view"" for the 12th time.

THE AMBIANCE
Anyway, despite not knowing that there are actually two entrances to this place (one from THE Hotel side for the restaurant and one from MBay for the lounge) I did manage to hunt down the maitre d' and get myself seated in a room that might otherwise be described as sterile & cold but with a 70's- porn-esque all-white décor and a monstrous chandelier made up off hand blown glass bubbles.  Sort of reminded me of a demure N9NE Steakhouse without all the overdone lighting... or the constant & entertaining parade of boobs walking in on high heels from Moon or Rain.   Yep, this doesn't look good.

THE SEATING
I sat next to several Gucci & DKNY decorated couples reminding me of my single days - ah, good times.  But overhearing their conversations, it seemed unanimous however that this restaurant was not really a destination amongst those that were there.  In fact, everyone seemed to be there 'just because it was open and available' and they decided to give it go.  Again, not exactly a ringing endorsement if all 4 couples are entirely new customers with none returning.  The view was pleasant enough of course, being that the Mandalay Bay's view of the strip is unmatched and of course the cocktails were top shelf with the property being half watering hole.

THE MENU
Yum.  Menu's lookin' good.  Lobster Caesar.  Hot Chicken/Coconut Thai Soup.  Bigeye Tuna Tartare.  Seared Duck Foie Gras.  Eggplant/Zucchini/Tomato/Mozzarella Gazpacho. Shrimp Cocktail.  Spicy Crab Salad w/ Guacamole & Heart of Palm & Cilantro.  Hmm!  That last one sounds good.  Excuse me waiter... hit me up with one of those.   

The waiter proceeds to let me know they also have, along with the regular menu, a ""Rossini"" Filet that's available off-the-menu:  An 8 oz Filet Mignon topped with Seared Foie Gras and slices of truffles, served in a wine & beef reduction sauce.  GAH!  Must... have... Rossini!   I did eyeball a few other dishes on the menu such as the Roasted Maine Lobster ""Au Curry"" w/ Coconut Basmati Rice, Striped Bass w/ Roasted Fennel, Seared Scallops with Sweet Corn Fricassee & Bacon, and Prawn Crusted Halibut... but I remained firm and stuck to my guns like a mole to Cindy Crawford's face.

THE VERDICT?
I was embarrassed that I'd been secretly bagging on the restaurant in the back of my mind.  Serves me right for pre-judging.  The salad was scrumptious, reminding me of a Peeky toe crab appetizer that I once had at ""Joe's Seafood, Steak, & Stone Crab"" at Caesar's Forums.  The bed of lump crab meat was spiced with a tomato dressing & a bit of pepper & cilantro balanced with a topping of mouthwatering coolness:  A large 'hat' of guacamole & palm heart strips.  I challenged myself not to gobble it down like Fred Flintstone.  I failed epically and horked it down.

The meal was accompanied by a variety of breads & two different types of room temperature butter - a peanut-based butter and a traditional.  One thing that was a refreshing surprise was a complimentary drink:  The chef's spin on a Pina Colada served in a martini glass featuring a heavy coconut froth atop pineapple rum.  Strong but without the alcohol taste, this is a deal-closer for any single guy.  Ladies beware.

But the steak... ooh, that steak.  That was damn good steak.  Used to a bit more char & grilling and a lot less 'sauce', this MIX preparation of a Rossini steak had a monstrous amount of foie gras to allow the diner a bit in every bite, along with just enough truffles to savor along the way.  I easily sliced the filet into thin strips and in an instant, this became one of my favorite entrees of the week.  I was so impressed that I ended up using it as a benchmark for other steaks I had during my trip including those at Del Frisco's, Fleur D' Lys, Rosemary's, & ENVY Steakhouse.

The dinner was closed with a complimentary pair of fresh-baked Madeleines with a warm nutella dip.  Pleasant.

CONCLUSION
If you go to the restaurant, and you're a food snob, try not to turn your nose up too quickly.  If anything the salad and steak I had was utterly satisfying and I'd hate for MIX to have to deal with more rat bastards like myself.

The lights surround a staircase that leads to a private dining room. All the windows were floor to ceiling. The only way you could get to the restaurant is in a private elevator.

I expected a bit more given the Ducasse association, but the dining experience is quite good and (almost) worth the price. Just a few comments:

-The lobster Casear salad is way too big and totally out of keeping with the portion size of just about everything else on the menu. It can easily be shared by two folks.

-I found that the meat dishes (duck, beef, and pork) outshined the seafood alternatives. I am particularly fond of the artisan pasta with duck appetizer -- a must-do for all duck lovers.

Olivia started with a miXOPOLITAN ($16) with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, White Cranberry, Candied Lemon, and a string of Fresh Cranberries. It was sweet and refreshing at the same time.

Prior to my dining experience at MIX, I'd been there quite a few times for drinks, dancing. THAT is fun. Dance the night away while enjoying a perfect view of the Las Vegas Strip. That experiences were worth 4 stars. 

However, my dining experience could hardly compare.

First, when we arrive, all of the windows are closed and there is no view of the strip. (The MAIN reason we came to MIIx was for the view.) **noted, the view was visible from the bar area, but not the dining area

Second, the food quality at MIX is hardly worth the amount of money it costs.

The vegetable plate that the server recommended to me consisted of squash & carrots that tasted off-beat, as though it came straight from the aisle of the frozen food section. 

The $32 Cod looked like a meal that would be served in a Conference Center at some hotel.... maybe off a buffet. Plus, it was bland.

I noticed two women sitting at a table next to us and both of them had their purses on the floor. I'll be damned if I'm paying 75$/person for a meal and I have to sit my belongings ON THE FLOOR!

There are many dining options in Vegas, I would NEVER choose the MIX again. In fact, I've found plenty of restaurant/bars that offer a beautiful view in Vegas, I may never even visit MIX again to experience that view....

A few minutes later, the restaurant manager called me and apologizing that their reservation system had a glitch, the restaurant was completely booked for a private function.  He then suggested that he can put me in the MIX lounge, which also has a great view and do serve some appetizers.  I had nothing better to do so I agreed.  When I arrived and to my surprise, my name was on the VIP list.  The manager put me right smack at the center of the lounge looking out 64th floor to the entire Strip.  Every staff knows me by my name and apologized for the mistake, and the manager also make sure I was comfortable.  Throughout the night, every staff continue to pay attention to me, and make sure I am well taken cared off, we both felt like VIPs.  To make the long story short, I end up having the best night in Vegas. Watching a huge thunder storm came from afar, hitting the windows, passed thru, then left with a spectacular rainbow, what a night!

I have been in many great restaurants in Vegas, but MIX manager's attention to details and the sincere desire to make things right for me was really impressive and beyond my expectation, way beyond. I will definitely come back, ....",7QUeWTx-BjF3E0hwKhzZMw,6,6,5,QHEft-43wokPv1nGRac_rQ

Wow - this place is PHENOMENOL!!!! Definitely dress up coming up here - suits and dresses.

The cocktail lounge is pure awesomeness. We were with a wedding party - and it was just awesome! My daughter got addicted to the dance floor zone and was dancing her little heart away on the flashing colors. What better way to wear her energy out to the beat of the background music?!?!

And for those who want require or prefer ""virgin"" drinks - I would strongly recommend the Virgin Mojito! They made one for me with mango juice, lime, mint, and club soda - DEEELICious!!! And for the tiny ones in tow - they are extreeeeemely accommodating to making beverages your little ones are sure to love! (yes not the best environment for a toddler, but like I said, we were with a wedding party - so have to give props for that factor as well).

Ok - now one will have to use the loo at any given point hanging out anywhere. Ummm yeah - I'm writing about it - because it was my first experience of having a full window view while sitting on the you know what!!! I was initially going to shoot for the first door - but the service cleaning lady, pointed me very kindly to the other ones with the view. And sooo, it's a bit awkward at first, but ya get over it.

Now to the restaurant side - wow! Talk about night and day difference! While the lounge is very dark (black furniture, black floors, black walls floor to ceiling), the restaurant side is everything white!! Our seating area was under the staircase - and they have these awesome heavy glass blown bulbs surrounding the dining area to give a more intimate feel. There are plenty of seats outside this area for more happy diners, and even the Eggshell seats (for those intimate dinners you want with your loved one).

Since we were with a group - we didn't have the big menus, but a preselected menu option. Starters: Mixed Green Salad with a Sherry Vinagrette. YUM! Very light and the dressing was a perfect amount. My daughter was loving it so much she was diving both hands into the bowl to get all her yummy salad morsels. (She ended up eating half an adult portion of the salad - and LOVED every bite of it!) Our entree choices were Seared Tuna, Marinated Free Range Chicken, or Braised Wagyu!! Hubby and I both opted for the Wagyu since neither one of us have had it before - and boy we were NOT disappointed! The meat was sooo tender you didn't even need a knife to cut through! The meat was just sliding apart! Now for the wee tot we got her her very own yummy gourmet mac 'n' cheese. Normally our daughter will share - we had to bribe her to share her mac 'n' cheese with us! And lemme tell ya - it was AWESOME!

Now to the dessert - Cocunut lime sorbet, with a fancy crumble on the bottom with a homemade chocolate candy bar plated on the other side. One word: YUUUUUUMMMMYYYYY!!!! It's light and crunchy and chocolatey. What more can i say?

Service - impeccable. Everyone aims to please you here, and you are not disappointed.

And 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the MJ One show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. So we left. And came here. A bit different, to put it mildly. Service was impeccable, but not snooty. The Missus and I both got different tasting menus. Mine was the Alain Ducasse 4 course one sans wine. From the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the foie gras topped filet to the Armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. First time with foie gras. Would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. All I know is the junk was tasty. The only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. They were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.

The service was fine for a restaurant at this level.

3118232,2013-02-09,5,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"MIX is one of those Vegas restaurants/clubs that you should see at least once;  After all, the views are impressive and vibe, ultra-lux.   But as often is the case in this town, the place is more about style than substance.  And there's certainly lots of style to go around here.

Located on the top floor of THEhotel (a smallish boutique hotel in the Mandalay Bay superstructure), MIX can be a little difficult to locate. I was actually staying at THEhotel the first time I ate here and had a hard time finding it. There are no signs or brochures promoting it, and it wasn't even mentioned in the in-room resort guide. This is intentional of course, and adds to the mystique and (artificial) sense of exclusivity.   

To further boost its guest's sense of self-importance, MIX is serviced by a single unmarked glass elevator with the usual matrix of floor buttons, the topmost of which is marked simply ""mix"" (I had used the elevator a few times earlier in the day and hadn't even noticed it).   Press that button and you're whisked to the top floor of the hotel (or should I say THEhotel) with dizzying views of the city en route.

As you step out of the elevator, you'll notice that the decor here is über-trendy, complete with a $1M+ glass champagne bubble chandelier that dominates the room.  The style is sort of Robert Ryman meets Paris Hilton:  White walls, white tablecloths, white chairs, even white china.  White on white on white on white; If you're a neo-minimalist who can stare in awe for hours at a small white dot on a white canvas, this is your place.

In terms of cuisine, I couldn't really sense a theme here.  Modern American, perhaps?  But everything I tried was well made and artfully presented, with the ubiquitous petite portion sizes so popular in trendy Vegas eateries (I suppose that's how some of the super models in evidence here stay in their size zeros).

While the cuisine was certainly adequate, nothing really stood out for me (other than the cool stainless steel bowls in which our salads were presented).  And that's an issue when you consider all the world class restaurants in this town. With such stiff competition, there's really little incentive for a return visit, other than the views perhaps (which are pretty awesome, I'll admit).  But then MIX is one of those places you go to be seen and to enjoy the spectacle of it all;  The food isn't really the main event.

All in all, my takeaway was a solid ""meh"".   Like much of Vegas, MIX is certainly worth a first date but isn't really long term relationship material.  However, if you're in your early 20s and want to club the night (and your trust fund) away in Paris' penthouse, MIX just might be your spot.",ZDMLDPkpc9ob9XIFOjRw1g,5,3,4,DWRv2UR4w30wUedicRoGdw

The Boneless Ribeye with black peppercorn was not visually appealing, but its flavor wasn't too bad.  Mix's downfall were their side dishes. The Wild Mushroom Fricasee was limp and unflavorful.

It did take them some time however to seat us at a table despite the early reservation time and lack of patrons. The restaurant was crowded later that evening, which was a bit annoying because the tables were placed so close to each other. I could not have a private conversation without the next table overhearing. Also, they dim the lights too much, so I couldn't really see what I was eating.

However, the other wait staff members didn't seem to care, and were not very friendly. Aside from that, the food was PERFECT. I recommend the surf and turf, it was divine!

After hearing many great things, my casino host booked my friend and I reservations a few weeks back. 

Upon arriving, we had to wait a few minutes for a booth by the window, which I specifically requested. Alas, this accommodation was made, except we were seated at one of the booths without a view. Annoying.

After perusing the menu, we decided on the tasting menu, which sounded absolutely lovely. Our harried waiter was too busy to take our order, so another waiter said that we ""looked like we'd been waiting a while"" (we had) and asked if he could take our order. 

The first few courses went by at a leisurely pace. Our waiter was basically absent for the meal. Just about every staff other member in the restaurant accommodated our requests. Have you ever had a pastry chef get you a soda refill? I hadn't either. 

Just before the dessert course, we asked to add an additional dessert and would gladly pay for it, since neither of us were sure we'd like the tasting menu option. A full 35 minutes later, we'd still seen no dessert. Finally our waiter showed up with the additional one we ordered (after asking about it twice) but the one from the tasting menu was still a no show.

Getting the check took another bit of time and when it arrived, we were given no apologies for the lack of the dessert. Even after mentioning it, he didn't offer to get us a new one or remove the one that we did receive from the bill, since the tasting menu course didn't arrive.

Here's a couple of other flaws:
- My friend didn't get his coffee refill (which he asked for multiple times)
- My Diet Pepsi Refill
- Diet Pepsi. Ew.
- The bread basket arrived at our third tasting meal course.

My boyfriend and I visited this place on a Thursday night - their ladies night, free drinks for ladies until 12 am. The place was filled with middle aged folks. The dance floor had a few women dancing by themselves and the DJ was spinning top 40/hip-hop/mainstream house. The main attraction was the spectacular view from the 64th floor, but only half the balcony was available since the other half was reserved for bottle service. The decor is very cool, all black and modern especially the bar area. We saw them handing out jello shots but unfortunately we didn't get any.

The Foursquare page for this bar says that there are drink specials for people who check in (and the specials are listed on the page).  When I approached the bar tender and showed him my phone, he was a big dick about the special and said it wasn't real.  He was angry at me and said that they weren't in charge of that page (apparently someone hijaked it and was making things up?).  I wasn't really pleased with the guy's attitude and then he was a dick to my group for the rest of the night.

Service is super, super slow (especially if you're outside) so don't bother staying here for a few drinks.  By the time you're done with your first one, you'll be so bored that you want to leave and go somewhere else for more drinks.

The drinks are also obviously pretty expensive and they only have standard cocktails (nothing unique or new).  Beer is insanely expensive and my Coors wasn't even cold when they brought it out.

Main course, I had the fois gras, in which, I only brought because its illegal everywhere else, and I had the mac and cheese which tasted awful. The BF had the filet mignon with fois gras that he really enjoyed but the mashed potatoes was a miss.

something worth mentioning: when we were offered wine we declined, telling the waiter that we were sticking to cocktails that night, so we were all poured a complimentary glass of wine with our appetizer because ""the chef insists that you try this wine with your appetizer."" free wine? awesome! and then when we finished our meal and were too full to get dessert, the waiter brought us complimentary desert! actually, we each got two desserts! we were told the chef didn't want us to leave without having something sweet. alright by me! im sure the intent of giving us free stuff was to get us to buy more stuff and maybe we're assholes for not taking the bait. but i thought it was just kind of awesome.",ZCtJdzlP71QNIdDoKhg63g,0,0,5,NeOvO2WwLH9hMBVp4vGc4A

Atop ""THEhotel"" at Mandalay Bay on the 64th floor, miX is probably THE best destination to get high in all of Sin City...if you're drug free like me and only seek natural and aerial highs.

VIEW: it's a dream come true for Instagram hashtag whores and Asian tourists alike. I could give you my take on the view (sit outside if you can and don't mind the breeze - there are heat lamps too) but many of the pics speak for themselves. It's like you're on top of the world, or Vegas. Same thing, right?

PICS: glad we showed up a bit after 5p as we got clearer shots but were also able to take more as it darkened and the city lit up.  If you have the right camera and/or settings you can capture images at night without the flash reflecting back on the glass.

VIBE: I really liked the open-air setting on the balcony, it's something you don't necessarily get in other major cities that have rooftop-like dining establishments. Our seating set-up provided a relaxing and comfortable environment that enhanced the views even more. ""Styling & Profiling"" indeed! Dining inside doesn't seem too bad either.

DRINKS:
-Pomegranate Manhattan: it was a good drink to start with, but had lots of ice in it so quantitatively it's more of a teaser. But what can I say, it's Vegas so it is what it is.
-miXopolitan: Absolut citron and cranberries are featured in it. This was sweet and perhaps more satisfying when it comes to volume.
-Beers: I didn't get any but they do have Stone IPA & Lagunitas, yay!
FOOD:
-Mini Beef Short Rib Tacos: w/ guacamole and créme fraiche OFY!!! Who doesn't like some créme fraiche? These tacos had a nice zing to them.
-Sweet & Sour Duck Spring Rolls: I'm always happy whenever I can get some duck.
PRICES: ended up reasonable for Vegas due to the HH discount. You don't go to a place this cool and expect cheap prices, so you may want to be here with the mindset that you're just going to enjoy your life and not worry about the $$$ for a bit.
SERVICE: they represented their establishment well and checked up on us just at the right level of frequency. One girl in particular was pretty hot too.  Maybe it's a good thing she wasn't our server, or I would've been checking her out instead of the views!

The ambiance was remarkable.  So, let me remark.  Thousands of blown glass balls strung in a gorgeous piece of art greet you at the entrance.  Cue the view.

The wine by the glass list was disappointingly brief, but the quality was strong.  The prequels of bread and salad were NOT delicious.  And service was inattentive from some staff and uberattentive from others.

HOWEVER, things got rolling with the entrees.  The bison was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had.  Flavorful.  Lean.  Delicious in it's peppercorn sauce.  My date LOVED her cod and said it was one of the best things SHE's ever had.  Things were looking up.

Need i remind you that we just sat down! He must of told us to hurry up 3 times before we ordered. I ordered the Scallops, free range chicken breast and some kind of truffle soup. I must say the food was good though. Despite the irritating service the food was well prepared and had tons a flavor. However, I cant justify three small scallops for $50. 

Also, their dessert is excellent. Their tiramisu is to DIE for. We ordered two of those. This Apple pie type thing and some ice cream. If your hungry don't come here for their entrees, but do come there for their desserts.",QGFRlC9-wmWVV1XCVLeJhA,3,0,3,Bd5SXEwLCKoT4C4ZgrNPwg

We did this on purpose so that we could enjoy the view and talk to someone about having a party with table service, passed apps etc.

The patio was rented by some corporate party, so that was closed.  No one would talk to us and the bartender would not even make eye contact. 

I guess we were not hot enough.  


The second time was perfect.  We went in on Friday early 7pm. it was not that busy and we got a table outside.  
The waitress was so nice and helpful and told us were to go to get some good seafood. 
LOVED HER, LOVE THE VIEW.  That was nice of her to take the time 

Yeah the drinks are expensive, you people forget you are in VEGAS.  

The other couple we were with kinda freaked out. 
""Where in the world did you get the idea that Vegas is cheap."" 
They thought we were gonna spend the weekend at the all you can eat prime rib for 9.95$  
I don't think they have those anymore, right?  So we bought the round. 

Then we asked the cocktail waitress if we could come back after ten for the music and did we have to pay a cover.  She told us to talk to the hostess desk down in the lobby right in front of the elevators and ask them to stamp your hand so you can come back in for free.  

The guy looked at me all puzzled and said STAMP? HUH?  Then he hands me his business card and said I'm the manager just come on up front and see me later.  LOVE them

When you get off of the elevator you walk into the lounge which is all dark a few steps forward and you are overlooking all of Las Vegas. 

Of all the lounges i have ever been to ever in my life i truly believe this one has the best view!! If you are looking for a private party spot the upstairs champagne rooms are amazing they have the entire roof decorated in what looks like tiny lights they twinkle like the stars do it was so cool!!! When we finally reached the dining room we were breathless!! It is all white with white dining new aged space booths really cool hard to describe i have only seen them at the MIX. We had a cute table for 2 that overlooked all of Las Vegas!! 

The seating is really close to all the other couples which at first was a little weird but then turned out to be great we were all suggesting different dishes to our new friends. I had a lentil soup to die for and a seafood medley the portions are small yet filling. 

They have a wine list to die for it might be the best one i have ever encountered. The wine cellar is all glass and displayed as part of the decor. It was so extravagant it must of been 50 feet tall and 200 feet long it was huge they used this long latter to climb up and down to retrieve bottles of wine.

I usually don't prefer eating super fatty meats, but I'll make an exception for the pork belly. The fat actually augmented to the flavor of the dish greatly, and it wouldn't be pork belly w/o the fat. The only complaint I have is that it is a little bit on the salty side.

I ordered the ""special"" which came with a filet topped with foie gras and black truffles (see pic).  Both the filet and foie gras were excellent, however the truffles I was looking forward to turned out to be nothing special.  The dish also came with a side of mashed potatoes which I thought were ok but again amazing...Believe it or not, the hit of the night was the ""mac and cheese"",....you might be thinking ""wtf"", but yes, it was THAT good.  The macaroni was perfectly ""al dente"" and the cheese tasted tangy like gruyere but I forgot to ask...I highly recommend you try this.  I also got a chance to try my friend's chicken dish and I was amazed how good that was as well.  The skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.  I forgot what boutique California blend my friend ordered but it opened up nicely and made the steak and foie gras that much better.  For dessert we shared the complimentary madelines w/ nutella and also munched on our friend's bday dish which amounted to something resembling a snickers bar but 5x richer and included some actual 24kt gold leafing on it which I'm told was edible.  Service was good and the view from the restaurant is one of the best on the strip.  Pricing is Vegas-style so expect to pay $80-100 per person not including alcohol, tax or tip.  Overall 4.5 stars for the food and decor and an extra half star for keeping the kitchen open a little later for us and not kicking us out when we were still there past 1am.

We ordered the tasting menu.  Started with amuse bouche of lobster on top of citrus gelatin.  very good flavor.  Next was the gnocchi...best I ever had.  the potato gnocchi was so smooth and flavorful...not chewy like most places.  Then they served lobster curry on bed of coconut rice.  They gave large pieces of lobster.  You can literally smell the sweet aroma of lobster as they were serving it.  Next course was filet mignon topped with foie gras and truffle.  Steak was tender, but most impressive was the size of the foie gras on top of the steak.  cooked perfectly.  Don't taste too much of the truffle though.  The dessert was ba ba rhum (sponge cake topped with rum and cream)...the only low point of the meal.  sponge cake was good, but the whole dessert was plain.

The various reviews hadn't really prepared me for how decadent the place is. My hunnie had scored us a table on the outside patio so that we could watch the sunset settling over Vegas. The view alone was worth the visit to Mix. The service was impeccable. The meal was delicious. We had a cappacio of some sort of white fish for appetizer. I can't remember the name but the dish was phenomenal. Bursting with flavors, the fish was fresh and the taste was fantastically balanced. My hunnie had a pork roast which was served in a mini personal roasting pot. THAT had tasted so good, I kept stealing from him. I had bison for the first time. It was good, but not wow. The peppercorn gave it a nice kick, but compared to the pork roast... it just wasn't as good. yeah, so i kept stealing from my hunnie and he ended up finishing my bison for me. hee.

After dinner, we headed over to the other (the black side) of Mix for drinks on the other outdoor patio. There, they had these bedlike sofas which you can lay down upon and drink your drinks seductively. Very cozy. Highly recommended.

3480034,2012-03-10,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I was here years ago with my fiancee and had a very nice time.  But this review pertains only to my experience in mid-January.

We were a group of three couples with an 8:30 dinner reservation.  We had a couple drinks beforehand and showed up at 8:25.  They had us wait about ten minutes while they found us a table.  Then we were walked over to the patio door and told to wait.  When we realized they were intending to seat us outdoors, we declined.  (It was below 50 degrees outside and two of the ladies were wearing skirts, so we knew the space heaters would not suffice.)  We were a bit put off by the fact that they didn't even ask us if we were okay with sitting outside.

So we waited by the check-in area for a while longer until a table was ready.  WARNING to Yelpers: If you are a party of SIX, be prepared for a really tight fit.  We were seated at a small round table that would've been comfortable for four and snug for five.  With six people, not only are you elbow to elbow, but there's barely enough room on the table for breadsticks and wine glasses let alone multiple appetizers.  We tried to switch tables but were told the request could not be accommodated.  I noticed another group in the same predicament, so I'm not saying we were mistreated; just keep in mind that if you ever visit with a party of six, it would behoove you to fight for them to put multiple wall/booth tables together for you.

By this time it didn't take us long to figure out what we wanted.  However when we told our server, he informed us he was busy with a birthday and that a different server would be over shortly.  For the rest of the meal we had two servers, which meant multiple visits from them within minutes followed by times when we wouldn't see them for quite a long time.

So we chit-chatted and ate our appetizers and we finally reached a silent moment during which we realized our food was taking a long time.  We were proactive and asked our server about it and were told that it was ""almost ready"".  I don't know how much longer we waited, but it was quite a while.  For this group with an 8:30 reservation, we finally got our entrees at 9:50pm!  Had we not sought out our servers several times, who knows how long it would have taken.  By this time, most of the restaurant had emptied out and we thought about asking to be moved to one of the nearby large tables, but we did not want to delay things anymore than they already were.

I was asked multiple times if I would like a glass of wine since I kept the drink menu.  I kept telling them I'd order when the food came, but my buzz had been completely killed by that time, so I didn't even bother.

The entire ordeal sort of ruined our night as we tried to rally with some drinks back at the room afterwards, but we were so exhausted, we didn't bother with the Mix lounge and it was all we could do to head downstairs and gamble for half an hour.

All in all, the service was friendly, the food was as good as you would expect for the prices, and the restaurant itself was pretty neat.  But the lengthy delays and the cramped situation made my fiancee and I feel pretty guilty that we had spoken so highly of the restaurant and convinced the other couples to come all the way down the strip to eat here.",0ClrpTuQXT5DVYbsAdOQSg,2,0,2,2FwM3sTpjuTn2Tm_3vCrdQ

First off, this place is, hands down, nicest decor I've ever seen for a restaurant/lounge. Second, the appetizers and desserts here are AMAZING. Third, the view is breathtaking.

Decor: 5
Food: Appetizers 5, Entrees 3.5, Dessert 5
Service: 3.5
Price: It's what you expect to pay. Note** We didn't end up ordering any drinks so I can't tell you how good (or bad) those are

Food: For the appetizers we ordered the tuna tar tar and foie gras (the bigger portion). The Tuna Tartar was delicious but theFoie Gras was AMAZING. The pieces are pretty damn generous and it sits in this slightly sweet sauce (but I like the taste of it by itself). My gosh, this really set my standard for good foie gras. I would come back just to order a bunch of foie gras for myself. For the entrees, we ordered halibut and sea bass. Now, I'm not a big fan of those two fishes to begin with so to me, the entrees were just okay. However, my boyfriend loves halibut and he said that it was cooked very well. Now comes the dessert, we ordered the Mix Candy Bar. YUM YUM YUM!  It's basically a chocolate, peanut butter and graham cracker (with other stuff I don't remember) bar with a lime coconut sorbet on the side. The rich chocolate and light sorbet really really complemented each other well.

Service: Our waiter wasn't the most attentive but he was definitely the most honest, which I appreciate. The downside was, he always seemed to be walking away and was always hard to track down. He was also a big fan of upselling EVERYTHING. Sheesh, please stop. However, the upside? He would straight up tell us whether something was good or not. I loved it. ""Is this good?"" ""No not at all"" haha I do appreciate that he didn't try to water down how much he hated something.

I would've given this place a 5 if the entrees weren't so underwhelming (maybe I just ordered the wrong things?) but oh well. I LOVED everything else

One more thing, when they ask you if you want sparkling or flat water, just say tap. I made the mistake of thinking it was tap and they ended up bringing over VOSS water which cost a whopping $10. $10 for water? COME ON now. I will know better for next time.

Obviously people come here for the view, which, from the restaurant is nice. But if you want the really good view, head over to the lounge area and take a look. It's easily the best view I've seen of the strip so far.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,1,1,4,jTrmk12E8w7AmhzU4XC3Gg
3517658,2012-02-24,2,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Once you look past the annoying spelling of miX and THEhotel (really, is the pretentious capitalization of those letters necessary?) you realize that the restaurant is more style than substance. The view, particularly from the outdoor balcony, is one of the best in town. The mod atmosphere created from the wall of bubbles in the center of the main dining area, the oversized pod dining booths, and spartan decor would lead you to believe that the meal you're about to enjoy will be both trendsetting and unforgettable. It's neither.

A French restaurant with a decidedly American spin along with Latin and Asian influenced dishes, the food sounded and looked better than it tasted. The gnocchi, sitting in a savory veal jus, was more mushy than pillowy. The tuna tartare was memorable only because of the bold sweetness and acidity of the mango chutney.

The entrees we dined on were good, but underwhelming for the price. Without the benefit of the bernaise and peppercorn sauces the under seasoned filet would have been disappointing. I did enjoy the curry sauce on the roasted Main lobster ""Au Curry"" dish, but the bed of bazmati rice -- and I use the term ""rice"" loosely -- was like eating oatmeal. Not a good combo with lobster in my opinion. The claw meat was wonderful, but the tail meat was so tough I had to use my wife's steak knife to cut it.

For dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle. Not bad, but the highlight was the rocky road ice cream it came with. The other couple we dined with ordered the apple quince and caramel -- a tatin with a caramel parfait and green apple sorbet. I was able to sneak in a few bites and thought it was a fabulous mix of sweet and tart flavors. Following dessert madeleines were brought out for the table. A nice gesture, but they were so dry that not even the nutella that came with it could save it.

The disappointment didn't end with the food. Service was too casual and lackluster for a place that has garnered a Michelin star. I don't remember our server's name, but he seemed to be more suited to renting out surfboards on some random beach than working at a ""high-end"" French place.

This place was just 100% awesome. Super cool decor, and the quality of the food was just top notch. I don't understand why there are people that complained about the table arrangements on Yelp.

Both my wife and I each ordered from a different prix fixe menu, and we would highly recommend it! We found that the wine paring as well as the timing and order of the courses to be just perfect. The portions of each course did not seem very large, but somehow, it really fills you up! We were barely able to walk out after the meal!

The $90 entrees were a bit to expensive for my taste so we opted to go with the $30-$40 dollar range to see what that would get us.

There were a total of 5 in our party and she got all of our orders out in 10 minutes and we had more than enough time to savor our meals!

The bad:

3544374,2011-05-10,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"This is for the RESTAURANT PORTION of Mix. Don't be FOOLED by the 4 star reviews for MIX the lounge. You'll hate it.

I can't help but rate 1 with the terrible service we received at the restaurant last weekend.

We went to Vegas for Uncork'd but because my 30th Birthday had just passed we wanted to do an intimate dinner with close friends. Part of why we chose to stay at THEhotel at Mandalay was because we knew we wanted to have dinner at Mix. The views were gorgeous and the interior was just right up my alley.

When we made reservations for the hotel, we also made reservations for Mix so it was well in advance. Close to 3 weeks. At that time we were not asked if we wanted to sit outside. We didn't even know there was outdoor seating for dinner. I thought that was only part of the lounge area.

First mistake was sitting us outside without asking if it was ok till later in the evening. It was a little hot for 8pm, but we figure with the views and the soon to be ordered drinks, it would be fine. We didn't think we'd be there for 2.5 hours anyway.

30 minutes pass and all we have so far is water and a menu. The waiter, I believe his name was Lukas, finally comes with the drink and wine menu along with the specials. He was actually pretty knowledgeable about the food so that was probably the first (and only) good sign.

He comes back to take our order 15 minutes later - still with only water. We ask for bread. Awesome. We have to ask for our own bread when it's obvious the tables around us have bread (and drinks). At this point, no one even wants to drink because the moment has passed. We're 45 minutes into the dinner with water and a menu. WTF? It's not even busy.

So we order. 

And then we wait and wait and wait. And laugh about waiting because it's just so ridiculous.

Over an hour into our 8pm reservations we have a glass of water with no ice in warm summers night, a couple cocktails because the service somehow managed to take away our fun spirits (and we're a rowdy but classy bunch) and some bread.

Oh but you know who had fun? The waiter sure did. This Mother F'n waiter sure was chatting it up with some ladies behind us. We saw the water guy more than him.

Close to 2 hours we manage to swoop up a bus boy to ask about our food. He says he'll check with our waiter and a few minutes later our food comes out. Did we just have to remind the bus boy, to remind the waiter, that he has a table to serve? Don't you watch Top Chef? Don't you know the chef's are bustin' their chops to get the food fired up?!

Our food was luke warm - not hot - which leaves me to believe some dishes were sitting out while this jerk flirted with the ladies. Who by the way, were not all that. I ain't mad at the cougars though.

By the end of the meal - we don't even want whatever the heck it is they do for birthdays - we just ask for the check. He then said ""are you sure you don't wanna see the dessert menu?"" We all kinda said no no no at the same time wanting to get the f*ck outta there and then he said ""I'll bring you out something anyway on the house for the trouble"" - he then brings out this crap that we saw him serving to everyone around us. So no, you're not sorry at all.

You just want your $100+ mandatory gratuity for a party of 8 that you didn't actually wait on and instead dodged our table for over 2 hours while the bus boy served us water.

We talk to the manager afterwards looking for a sincere apology and instead he decides to blame us for not seeking him during dinner. WTF? Why don't you get off your lazy a-hole and ask if your tables are doing ok if your waiters aren't doing the job.

Seriously, this was the worst birthday experience myself and friends have ever had to endure. 

And the worse part was that this guy got $100+ tip. I would have rather gave that to the guy serving us water all night long.

Oh and the food? Fish was overcooked which sucks because it was the Sea bass which apparently has been on the menu since day one... but because it was probably sitting out for 30 minutes probably over cooked. The filet's were good. Nothing amazing. 

Sad sad sad. We were defeated that night and had to head back to the room and rally up some cocktails.

The only GOOD thing about this night was that it was our first night in Vegas and made us make sure the rest of the trip was a-hole free. Well done MIX!",Ms4RhVKOV2DBneliYt5_Jw,11,1,1,M4DreEFnNIFr1ZNorR422w

The restaurant ambiance is also very nice with a glass bubble chandelier hanging from the center and panoramic views. However, it is still casual. The furniture has started to look a bit worn, or maybe we were seated in a bad corner which was right by the server desk.
There was some complementary bread as a starter, we weren't very hungry so we ordered the entrees directly. They were excellent - Brown Butter Cod and the Mediterranean Rib meat Lamb with Eggplant Lasagna. It was a great combination of flavors. We did not want dessert but the server brought us some complementary fresh baked madeleines with chocolate. It was nice but too sweet for my taste. 

Service was ok, our bread and water server was much friendlier than our main server who was just stiffly polite. It seems like the service is variable.

3583203,2010-02-19,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"There was a lot of build up coming into dinner here, and I can say that it lived up to it - barely. I expect a lot out of a restaurant that has a Michelin star, and rightly so. Those things aren't thrown around willy-nilly. 
I'll give my quick rundown then get into the details:
Atmosphere: 4
Service: 5
Food: 4

The atmosphere is hard to beat when you're on the 64th floor facing out over the gorgeous Las Vegas strip. You enter the restaurant through the lounge which is dark and moody, but really lovely. It goes from nearly pitch black to an overwhelming sensation of light when you round the corner to the dining room. There is a massive 35 foot champagne bubble chandelier that takes over the center of the room. It's truly gorgeous and sets the mood for a classy but nouveau style experience. We were seated at a half booth, and one of my complaints was that the seating arrangements felt crowded. Not only could we hear the conversations on both sides of us, but I had to put my jacket behind me because my neighbors' jacket was nearly touching me. When the waiters have to slide the tables to let you get in, I think it's a little close. That bothered me just a bit as this was our romantic Valentines Day dinner and I was hoping for a little more intimacy. 

The service was impeccable. It seemed like all we had to do was think of something that we wanted and someone appeared to make it happen. They have multiple attendants along with your individual server for each section and it pays off. We were never let wanting or waiting. We asked for a slow service and to not have our entrees fired until our appetizer had been cleared to give us time to enjoy the meal and it was done perfectly. Some places prefer not to do that because you take up time at the table, but they were very gracious and accommodated our request. The other thing I appreciated was the fact that they were there just enough-never over bearing. 

The food is what I was really looking forward to. Their bread basket contained 5 types of bread and 2 butters. The ciabatta and sourdough were my favorites. Their house made peanut butter was to die for but didn't go with any of the breads. The house sommelier stopped by and we picked out first glass of wine to go with out appetizer, tender potato gnocchi with pumpkin, crispy bacon, and veal jus. It was to die for. My boyfriend who is just beginning his foray into the gastronomic world was blown away. In a different setting, I dare say he would have licked the plate. My entrée was the surf & turf; lobster and stuffed chicken breast with salsify and wild mushrooms. The only dark spot on the plate was the chicken. I usually don't order chicken at restaurants because is it always overcooked, but I really wanted everything else on the plate. The chicken wasn't overcooked, but the 'stuffing' was lacking flavor and was so minimal. However, it was quickly picked up by the amazing flavor of the lobster and wild mushrooms. The salsify was cooked to perfection as well. It was incredibly delicious and there was so much lobster that I ate only a small portion of the chicken. My honey got the pork loin and belly over grits which he loved. There was also pulled pork in the pot that it came cooked in that tasted a little too much like its sauce came out of a Heinz can, but that's just my opinion. He enjoyed it all. The creamy grits really complemented the heavy smoky flavor of the pork belly. For dessert we split the 'candy bar' which is their homemade cookie center candy bar. It was really good. The chocolate was smooth and creamy and the filling was crunchy and sweet. We were so full at that point, but they brought around freshly baked vanilla-bean Madelines and nutella as a 'parting gift.' Of course I put mine away quickly seeing as how Madelines and nutella are two of my favorite things. Their Madelines were perfection. 

The bill came out to $220 with tax and tip, and I find that to be very reasonable for what it was. It was a great dinner and we finished with a drink in the lounge looking out over the strip. Good times!",AuY12hD6yXCcjrYy-09FJw,3,0,4,IF52bA_Kuf4TBdaaWF3pdQ

3617096,2009-04-21,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I'm not really a club sort of guy. I like bars, especially ones with good bartenders. I really like clubs where you can hear live music. I also really like Vegas - but I want to gamble in Vegas. I also don't want to pay tons of money for my drinks. I'd rather a buxom woman in a costume that is meant to be sexy but instead comes off silly and a wee bit sad (especially if she's a wee bit too old to be wearing such an outfit) hand me a drink for free in recognition of the fact that I'm playing a game where the odds are not in my favor.

Speaking as a man who went to Mix one recent Friday night - the odds are not in my favor, and they will probably not be in your favor either, Sonny Jim. 

My brother had his bachelor party in Vegas recently, and a local thought it would be a great idea for a bunch of us to go in on a table at Mix. Once we got there and learned it would be $50 a person, enthusiasm waned. Apparently, the local put the reservation on her credit card, so I was down $50 before even playing the tables... or getting a drink.

The elevator ride revealed the best part of Mix - the view. There's an outdoor patio area with fantastic views of the Strip. All night long there are a stream of sightseers and picture-takers hanging out there.

Our group settled into a decent-sized banquette, while a hostess prepared drinks. Our table came with a bottle of vodka, a bottle of champagne, a bottle of rum, and a bottle of whiskey... for 20 people. Luckily, the hostess knew how to make an old fashioned, and the whiskey was the least popular alcohol among my younger brother's friends - more for me.

The immediate downside of the club was noticeable. It was 10:00 p.m. and the place was nearly empty. Advertising portrays these exclusive nightclubs as the domain of the rich, the famous, the impossibly good-looking. Then you look up from your giant ice cube-covered bottle of ""super-premium"" vodka and realize that instead it's filled with people like you hoping to mingle with people not like you. At that point, you probably want to drink, and wouldn't you know it? Giant ice cube-covered bottle of super-premium vodka. With mixers!

One serious point of criticism. I'm a music fan, though I'm much more likely to be into indie rock than house or techno. I also currently live in the middle of nowhere. I should not know more about dance music than the DJ in a Las Vegas nightclub. The music was heavy on mashups and 80's retro. Seemed to me that this would be the perfect set for a some Girl Talk. After all, Feed The Animals is basically the Citizen Kane of mashup albums. So I asked the DJ (using the Notes feature on my iPhone as the club was impossibly loud even when near empty) to play some Girl Talk. He had never heard of Girl Talk or Feed The Animals. He was friendly and seemed interested in knowing more. But Feed The Animals was Blender's #2 recording of 2008. Time magazine wrote it up for crying out loud.  It was exactly the genre of music that the club seemed to play for the 3+ hours I was there. Remember the previous paragraph? We've already established that I'm not cool. What if I'm not cool AND I'm the coolest one in the club? The mind boggles.

Did I mention the dance floor is about the size of my kitchen? That's also a big strike. So assuming you lived on the 64th floor of your apartment, had a bottle of something and a big ice cube, downloaded Feed The Animals off of the illegal art website, and were in your kitchen, you could have almost as much fun as I had at Mix, without the pricey cover.

On the other hand, it's probably worth a visit if you've got a group of friends willing to go in on bottle service with you, if only for one night of faux high-rolling.",_q_z9bIwYg2q0mSNbwxmGA,1,1,3,ayMitESagDb4z__2nKZAsQ

The dish that stood out the most to me was their foie gras. I would have to say that was some of the best foie gras I've ever had. 

As we were finishing our appetizers, I noticed the chef come out and shake hands with a man from the table next to us. So I turned around to see who this special guest was.

Great view ...... 
64 floors above the Las Vagas Strip
Great service.
Great food.
Beautiful people .....

I went to MIX prior to seeing Kathy Griffen at the Mandalay Bay theater.
They advertised a prixe fixe ""Pre-show  Lion King dinner"" for $40.00.
It looked like a great chance to sample the menu at MIX at a price that I could afford.

It was a bit difficult in a setting as refined as MIx to order the ""Lion King"" dinner, but I got though the ordeal and totally enjoyed the presentation.

The meal comes out all together on a long tray (about 5 inches wide and about 2 feet long). The appetizer - a shrimp cocktail, one one end and the Tiramisu at the other end.

The style is ""Tapas"" with small plates of Filet Mignon, Lamb with beans and a stuffed red Pepper found in the middle of the tray.
A bread basket comes with several choices of fine breads.

I listened to the table next to me saying that ""wow, this is like tapas but it is the best tapas I have ever had.""

The meal comes with two glasses of either red or white wine.
All in all a totally enjoyable experience.

On my first visit I was able to enjoy the outdoor patio, 
even though it was a bit hot, there was a comfortable breeze to make the experience a total joy. 
The ambiance of the dining room is supurb. I ate indoors the second visit as the excessive heat forced diner s indoors.

The total service at your table is excellent.
The prixe fixe choice might be the ticket to enjoy a supurb dining experience.

Mix is part of a breed of upscale lounges that are reminiscent of modernized seventy's swank.  Plenty of curves and bold primary colors decorate the place.  A small private party room is available above the bar that strongly reminds me of a nest.  Around behind the nest reside small tables for those who want a more intimate setting.  Of course, bottle service is available here as well.

The door people tried to pull some shady stuff on my friends.  Too bad that happened, because it soured the group vibe a little bit.

He mentioned Tanqueray, Ten, Sapphire, and Magellan.  I told him I never tried Magellan.  He said most of his regulars order Magellan for gin and tonics, but it's not as good as Tanqueray for martinis.  Upon bringing my drink, he presented the bottle for my inspection.

1. I was staying at Mandalay Bay and wanted to do something close.
2. I had a $50 off Gift certificate
3. I thought to myself, ""well even if the food is so-so like I read, its got a great view and cool decor.""

Well I guess since I had lower expectations, I ended up being pretty happy with the experience. First thing I should mention, you really should view MIX as a French-influenced American steakhouse, as opposed to a French restaurant along the lines of Le Cirque. If you look at the menu, you'll notice how similar it is to a classic steakhouse. That said, the food isn't going to be mindblowing, but it is really good, albeit pricey. I love Foie gras, but at $32 for an app, this was the most I ever paid for it...but it was a nice sized portion and it was cooked perfectly. My filet mignon was perfect also, and i needed that after the chewy hangar steak I had at Sage the previous night. Dessert was a passion fruit souffle...again, very good...moist and eggy. 

The service was good, the setting was really cool..it really looks great in there at night with the lights dimmed...and the view was great also, althoguh tough to see because of the reflection on the windows. The elevator ride up is quite an experience also... a glass-enclosed elevator on the outside of theHOTEL giving you a view for the ride all the way up and back down.

3850403,2011-12-25,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"For the food and the restaurant decor/views, I would give FOUR stars. The service falls somewhere in between 2 and 3 stars. 

I took my mom here for Christmas dinner, and we were both impressed by the view and the decor as you walk in the restaurant. MIX sits on the 65th floor of the THEHotel next to Mandalay Bay, and the restaurant has dazzling 360-degree views of the Las Vegas Strip. In the middle of the main dining area is an artistic installation of a curtain of glass bubbles overflowing from the ceiling. It is quite impressive to watch. 

As for the food, we had fois gras and pumpkin gnocchi for appetizers. Both were tasty and just the right portion size. The fois gras is not as sweet as the ones I've tasted (where they caramelize it with fruit), and it is well seared. The gnocchi was creamy and had good flavor when paired with thin strips of bacon and cheese. My mom and I both ordered lobster dishes and they were both also very good. 

My biggest gripes about this place were related to the service. First, for the amount of money that I am spending for dinner, I expect my glass of water to be filled without me having to ask first. Same with the sodas. Instead, I had to ask the waiter at the end of the meal (when I was coughing out loud) for water. Secondly, my mom had asked for one of the items in their fixed price menu (which cost $28) as an a la carte. The server asked the chef, and he got back to us to say that this was okay. However, when I was finally ready to pay for the bill, they had marked this one item up as 100% MORE than the original price. I'm not worried about the price, but in principle, what they did was sneaky, and I did not like it one bit. Lastly, when we were leaving to walk towards the Mandalay Bay entrance (which is where we came in), they had to shoo us back towards the THEHotel entrance because of a private function (although the lounge itself was totally empty).

When you come up to the elevators the reservationists asks your name, points you to an elevator, you get out of the elevator with no clue as to where to go. You walk accross the lounge looking for anyone to help you. When you get to the restaurant they look at you and ask you for your name again, now why would you not communicate that from downstairs? We were able to find the restaurant quickly, but had it been busy inside I would have no idea where to go. 

The interior design of the restaurant and bathrooms is simply stunning and I was so excited for the meal to begin. We were brought the bread which had peanut butter and butter as a spread, cool idea, but not well executed. The peanut butter had just come out of the refridgerater as well as the butter and was not spreadable. I tried, but it just ripped the bread in half. 

The sommelier came over asked if we needed wine suggestions and I had told him that I was looking at a riesling, by the glass and wanted to know if it was sweet or dry. He said sweet and recommended something a little drier... so I picked the wine he suggested and out came a sickly sweet riesling. Weird to have a riesling this sweet by the glass, it reminded me of Ethos Late Harvest as a dessert wine. I suffered through it and never ended up finishing it. 

The food was underseasoned and the foie gras for my first course was WAY to sweet.. foie is so delicate, why would you over power it with so much sugary jam? My fish was overcooked and nothing wowed me. I was so disappointed in the food as this is Ducasse's place and how could I forget when our waiter was mentioning that it was ""Sir Ducasse's"" restaurant every five minutes. I get that you are proud, but you're just hurting his culinary reputation by touting it repeatidly. 

Service was good, although I had an entire mushroom side vessel spilled on the table and dripping into my lap. I'm sure the manager saw this as he was staring at our table all night, but never came over to appologize. 

Not a true representation of Michelin stars... I'm not sure why they even came to Vegas because compared to Europe the restaurants here are not deserving of Michelin.

The food: good, not mind-boggling, and certainly not proof of the existence of God. 
I had the rustic pasta which was salty, but satisfying. Then the veal ribeye which was like fatty pork. The bread was nice but not great. The wines by the glass were pretty good but a severely limited selection.

The service: very good. Perhaps this is the best thing about the restaurant. Very attentive and gentle. The waiter, busboys, sommelier and manager were all invested in making the experience a good one. As Lawrence Welk said: Thank you boys.

The room: cold and charmless...like eating in the terminal at La Guardia...except for the hanging glass bubbles which made me feel like I was in a glass of club soda.

The view: very nice, but because the restaurant is kind of on the side, the view from the MIx bar is better. As well, the tables are too close together so that it feels like everyone around you can listen to your conversation. No intimacy at Mix.

The biggest problem with Mix is that the food is way too expensive. 
I have one piece of advice, from someone who virtually eats out every night of the week...you will go out of business if you don't modify your price structure.
Read the business section of any newspaper: prices that were accceptable in 2004 are irresponsible and verging on offensive in 2009.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,1,0,2,1W5Atu-oCHgrgmr4Cy1wCw
3894000,2011-05-23,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"At the top of THE Hotel (not Mandalay Bay like some suggested) my party of ten dined here for a bachlorette/bday party weekend. Of the entire experience, I was most impressed with Mix lounge, which offers amazing views of the Strip and tasty cocktails in an outdoor/indoor lounge. I enjoyed a great lemon drop martini while waiiting to be seated. 

Here's where the stars begin to drop off. I was a bit thrown when the hostess at Mix said that they would not come get our party at the lounge or even give us some sort of beeper for when our table was ready. We came back for our 8:30 reservation (at 8:30) and ended up waiting 15 minutes while other parties where seated. It took a while for the hostess to even acknoledge us. It also seemed odd for a high-end, busy restaurant to only have one hostess.

Our table had two servers which was a bit confusing, especially since one server was great and the outher was lousey. The lousely server pointed out that we had (by mistake) ordered a half bottle for the table but when we asked for recommendations for a full bottle, he simply offered a name ""under the Oregon section"" and walked away. Doesn't seem much of a helpful recommendation, espcially with such an extensive wine list. It took a bit to thumb through and actually find the section where this wine was listed. 

To start the meal the table shared a plated of toast and meats with mustard and the ahi tuna with mango. The ahi was very good and small (I'd suggest the full order). The toast and meats plates certainly had toast...which was burnt black. The clever cook turned the burnt parts inward towards each other so the bread looked ok from the outside. The black toast was sent back.

Dinner was just ok. The majority of the table ordered pepper-crusted med-rare filets with sides. My steak came out visably medium, which I addressed to the 'good' waiter's attention. I ended up just eating it since it would have taken too long to re-order and my sides would have been cold. I tried the forked mashed potatoes, which were fine, as well as the wild mushrooms, which were also fine. Nothing mind-blowing. If your steak is lacking it's hard to get excited about the sides. 

Our fun waiter, though, was actually a blast. He was a ""retired"" chip-and-dales dancer that even did a spin and body roll to amuze the table while taking away our toast. You can't make this up!

He brought us a free pasion fruit dessert drink with coconut foam..which was amazing! I wish this was on the menu! He also served us fresh macaroons from the baking sheet with sides of nutella to end the meal (also complementary). While our one server came though, I'd say from the food experience, I wouldn't come back. Too many good food choices in Vegas to blow a couple hundred bucks on a meal here.

came here on a weeknight at around 9.30pm. very empty but better than crowded. the view was nice because we're on the top floor, but ok because there was nothing else besides lighted houses. 

goat cheese w/whatever- do not like this because i don't like goat cheese. the top part that comprises of whatever was pretty good.

roast maine lobster w/au curry & coconut rice- an american cum indian cum thai dish. very interesting. good this because it sounded so fusion. when i had my first bit at the threesome, all i could think of was how interesting it tasted. it wasn't phenomenal or aweful, but just not bad. not bad in an interesting way. i'm not even sure the coconut rice was made to have that kind of texture. lobster was well cooked just like the many i'd tried. 

chicken dish- can't remember the name but it baasically comprises of 2 chicken breast with a different marinate. one's good, one's so-so. skin's a little too salty but was cooked well. anybody who cooks knew that chicken was not an easy animal to cook. not easy to get it juicy and tender. one of the chicken was about 0.09% too dry.

candy bar(dessert)- our server twice what this was but still couldn't catch it. way too many layers. however, i love this for the taste of chocolate cake and candy. something like brownie, chocolate something and toffee. 

maidelaine dipped in hazelnut chocolate cream- very good maidelaine. cream was good, not too sweet.

our server was very cool and nice. they had bathrooms at 2 different location. one's at the restaurant itself and the other was at the adjoining lounge(which played some kinda euro/trance music i think). opted for the lounge because he mentioned the view. oh boy oh boy... sitting on the toilet bowl enjoying the magnificent view(of Mandalay Bay) was just awesome. it wasn't really the view but it was just sitting on the toilet bowl at the highest floor.",hO4_c3RN6w26qER6J_V8BA,1,0,4,1EtA2dj1i1Sw2K9jDJfGvg

We had to check back in with the podium when it was time for our reservation. That bothered me a bit, but they seated us right away. We had an outdoor table and it was great! The weather was perfect for dining outside and it was so worth it.

3955672,2012-07-09,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I had a great time at miX. I originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. My horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. They were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. My date and I were not rushed or anything during our dinner.

This place is beautiful! The bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that I was dining under the sea. Yet I'm at the very top of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. Our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although I was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.

We both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy crab salad, seared foie gras, halibut, lamb loin, and the miX candy bar. I believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. My date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into foie gras or lamb. Our server offered to switch out the lamb for the filet mignon for $10 extra. 

We started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. I enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. It was just right. It's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. 

I was enthralled by the looks of the spicy crab salad. Very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but I had too high of expectations on the flavors. I don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. For spiciness, I might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. I was a bit disappointed there.

Second course came about with seared foie gras with lemon confit & dates. I liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. I love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. Unfortunately, I'm not too educated in foie gras, all I can tell you is if I liked it and met my expectations of it. I got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. His piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, I just prefer a softer texture.

Third course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. Every. Bite. Was. Amazing. My general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. This dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. The flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. I seriously don't want to finish this dish because I don't want the experience to end. 

Fourth course was my lamb loin, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. Portions were generous, or maybe I was just very full. The spices on the lamb loin didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. I didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. Otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. The prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. Unfortunately I was hitting my maximum capacity.

That's when they brought out our pre-dessert. It was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. It reminded me of Thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. The tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what I needed!

And finally, the candy bar of miX served with coconut/lime sorbet. The looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. Yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. I liked the simplicity of it though. It tasted like a Ferrero Rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. The combination is great. The sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.

Our dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. It would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. In addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. It was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. Maybe next time :)",w3iXYLy7b89aoDxfU96i5g,1,0,5,0c9yOXQ82tJYjWoDcLmiCw

All the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if I needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty Sweet 'n Low packet.  My server was Haydee, and she was marvelous!

I got the Ducasse Classics, the grand tasting menu.  Before ordering, I asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if I could switch dessert because I didn't want to have the Baba Au Rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  He had me look at their à la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the soufflé and he would substitute.  That's customer service and it's very accommodating. 

Bread basket:  Standard types of bread.  One in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  That was great!  There was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  On the other side was a peanut butter spread.  It was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  Heavenly flavors.

The courses:

Amuse bouche:  Mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  Very light and tasty.

Appetizer:  Potato gnocchi with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  There were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  The gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi I have had!  Superb!

Fish:  Roasted Maine lobster ""au curry"" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  There was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. I tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     One small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell I bit into.  Now, if I were Scott Conant on ""Chopped"" I would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  It happens and was no big deal.

Meat:  Filet mignon Rossini.  A perfectly cooked filet--rare just as I asked with a large piece of delicate foie gras and several slices of black truffle.  It's the first truffle I ever had.  Before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, ""OK, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil.""  This was very tasty!

Pre-dessert:  A martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  Very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.

Dessert:  miX Candy Bar.  A candy bar made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  There was some edible gold leaf on the candy bar.  With it was a lime coconut sorbet.  The lime was very dominating such that again I tasted no coconut.  They must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.

Post dessert, dessert:  A different server brings to your table some warm Madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  You remove your own Madeleines with your fingers.  You also get a small bowl of Nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your Madeleine.

Nevertheless, the food was very good, albeit very pricey.

We shared the following:

Tuna tartare on guacamole with taro chips - This dish reminds me of the tuna tartare at Tasca in Los Angeles, though not quite as tasty.  The tuna was incredibly fresh (considering we're in the desert) but the guacamole slightly overpowered its flavor.  The taro chips were super thin and a great base for the tartare.

Potato Gnocchi with Asparagus and Morel Mushrooms - I have never had such flavorful morel mushrooms in my life.  However, the gnocchi had a slightly grainy texture and the asparagus was cooked unevenly.  Flavors were great, but I don't think I'd recommend this dish.

Beef Rossini - Oh my freakin heart.... steroid-free, naturally raised prime filet mignon topped with seared foie gras and black truffle reduction.  The dish, as you could imagine, was super rich and loaded with heavy flavors.  I enjoyed it to the last bite... however, it wasn't until we got the check that I found out it was a $77 item on the menu.  Ouch.  But soooo good.

Fresh baked madeleine with chocolate-nutella sauce - Best madeleines I've had in my life, served to us fresh off the baking tray.  I could eat 3 trays of this to myself.  The chocolate nutella blend was DELICIOUS, and I'm usually not a big nutella fan.

Wine - We had 5 glasses of wine.  They were divine!  Their by-the-glass selection is very well thought out and I don't believe there is a single bad choice you could make.

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal.  The service was amazing.  Every single person on their staff was attentive and friendly.  We never went a moment without somebody making sure we were enjoying our meal.  And I must also mention that the portions are huge (for this type of restaurant).  We split all three items we ordered, and the split portions were as large as most restaurants serve in full.

If it weren't for the price ($250 for the above... remember, we split the dishes), I'd easily give this place 5 stars.  However, if you want a great view and a great meal on the strip and $$ is not an important factor, Mix will NOT disappoint.",9IbtjnhH01duiWPpVhFXWw,0,0,4,87LP2aUHdp2bvxEPAhjakw

My boyfriend took me here for our 1 year anniversary.  While making a reservation, he asked for a booth.  When we arrived, they sat us in between booths where couples were able to sit right next to each other.  We ended up having to sit across from each other.  I felt discriminated because we were Asian.  But its OK, because our waiter was nice and helpful.

I ordered the Crispy Halibut, and my boyfriend ordered the Beef Tenderloin.  Both were extremely good.  We had the Tuna Tartar for an appetizer and it was oober yummy!  Fresh tuna, and the avocado paired with it...yum!  It was served w/ taro chips!  Great combinations.  The Halibut was on a bed of Eggplant caviar...so good and another awesome combination.

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with strung glass 'bubbles' acting as the sculptural centerpiece of the entire dining room.  My co-worker and I asked to be seated by the window to enjoy the beautiful Las Vegas night view from the 64th floor of  THE Hotel.  The hostess very coldly told us that the only-left window table was reserved for a ""marketing"" party.  WTF.  And for the record, that table was empty the entire night.

We decided to go for the ""A Taste of Mix"" tasting menu, the wine pairing, and the tuna tartare appetizer.  Pretty much fail.  We began our eating experience with an amuse bouche concoction of goat cheese, a yellowy mash, and an olive.  The girl sitting at the table next to us blurted out ""Gross"" when our server described what it was.  And indeed, it was gross.  It felt like gunk in my mouth.    

For starters, we had the Maine lobster salad.  The lobster was juicy and delicious with the sweetness of the melon. If you are ever unsure about what appetizer to order, you can always count on the tuna tartare being good at basically any SF restaurant.  The tuna tartare here had no flavor and DESPERATELY needed to be hit with some lime juice to punch up the flavors.  It was just a bland blob for $24.  

We moved onto our main courses - the stripped bass and roasted duck breast.  The bass was delicious with a sprinkling of little asparagus slices.  However, the blanquette sauce was a bit too cheesy for me after a few bites.  The duck was just weird.  It looked like a lame piece of boiled strip of meat that you would think would cut easily, but no, it was difficult to cut.  It did not have much flavor and simply did not look appetizing.  The baby turnips that the server said was ""SLOWLY COOKED for 5 HOURS"" looked like something my mom could whip out in 10 mins.    

I must say that the pre-dessert was the bright light during this dinner.  The passion fruit juice/mix of sorts topped with a sweet coconuty frothy cream in a martini was DELICIOUS.  The sweetness of the cream and the tartness worked beautifully.  

The tropical fruit sensation, consisting of guava sorbet and finely diced mango and other fruits was another let down.  The sorbet was incredibly tart and the fruits simply added to the tartness.  It desperately needed something sweet (like chocolate) to balance it out.  Our server noticed that we did no finish much of our plates and gave us freshly baked Madeline cookies (right out of the molds) with some nutella.  It was ok.  lol...not enough to make it a good dinner.

In addition to the pre-dessert, I thoroughly enjoyed my wine pairings.  I am not a wine person, but I did get to try two awesomely SWEET wines - the 2007 Riesling, Dr Thanisch and the 2007 Moscato D'asti, D. Rivetti. YUM YUM YUM :)

The restaurant:
They use to have a Restaurant.com deal so it helped with the steep pricing. The food is pretty good but not memorable.

The lounge/club:
This is not your traditional night club. There is a dinning section, the bar, the outdoors lounge (with a bottle service option of course). There is a DJ but the music is...mixed. I'm not quite sure what genre or timeframe it's from. Not many people dance and the patrons are generally a bit older than the trendy night clubs in town. The bar is a mess. They make some of the drinks ""in the back""...I put it in quotes because I don't know why the have to go to the back. I see the alcohol, I see the juices...mmm whatever. Like most nightclubs in Las Vegas, the bartenders are swamped and pressured to turn out drinks quickly. I feel for them on that front. But you don't have to have rude to me when I've patiently waited to be served unlike some other people that push and shove and throw money on the bar. Don't huff and puff at me and stomp around. For this reason, I'm not coming back.

Overall:
+Great view of the strip from here. You can't see as much from the dining room but the lounge is great. Also check out the lounge's restroom! You're in for a surprise!
-There's obviously no cover to get into the lounge from the restaurant but there generally is a cover after 9 or 10pm. There are often people in the lobby passing out discount entry passes but if you stop by the Mlife desk, they might give you complimentary passes. It's not worth it if you're paying to go up to see the view.

We were not disappointed. From the moment you walk in the hotel, you know you are in a hip, updated Las Vegas.  (The lobby smelled like coconuts!)

We were exactly on time and our party of 4 was immediately seated.  It took a while for me to take in the grandiose and beautifully lit dining room.  They had a couple of ""booths"" that looked like Disneyland's Haunted Mansion doom buggys.  Very cool.  But even cooler was the glass chandelier/sculpture that decorated the entire dining room.  It felt like you were sitting inside a bubbly glass of champagne.  I'll be sure to upload one of those photos. 

We decided to live like high rollers and go for the Grand Tasting Menu with the wine pairing.  http://mandalaybay.com/images/dining/mix_prix_fixe.pdf   
Yes, I know it's expensive, but it was one of the most memorable dining experiences ever.  Each course was an event onto its own.  I'm having trouble choosing my favorite.  Each course would have made a gorgeous meal by itself as a larger portion.  Oh, now I'm realizing I should not write this review on an empty stomach, my stomach is actually growling thinking about this meal.

The highlight of the evening was the Wine Director/Sommelier Christophe Tassan.  He was extremely attentive and chose amazing wines to complement each course.  He didn't know that my husband and I owned a wine shop until the end of the meal, and was pleasantly surprised to know how much we enjoyed the pairing.  He gave us a menu to take home with a detailed listing of the courses and the paired wines.  A very nice souvenir of our special evening.

Long story short, he proposed a second time when we went to Mix and had a whole sneaky plan worked out with the manager and sommeilier. 

We took the guest elevator up, since we were staying at Thehotel. The hostess was very gracious and seated us right away--outside which was awesome--the view is amazing, although in August, a little hot. Our waitress was amazing...very personable, able to recommend dishes and just fantastic all around. We started off with the potato gnocchi, which was fantastic--very light, but flavorful. We also had another appetizer, but I can not remember exactly what--other than that it was some kind of beef and melted in our mouths.

The bread with the homemade peanut ""butter"" was awesome--very yummy. For my entree, I had the lobster curry--lots of lobster, VERY flavorful sauce and a generous portion. The boy had one of the specials of the night which was filet, with foi gras(which was VERY tasty) and some kind of sauce. He definitely enjoyed it. We also split the side of the elbow pasta, black truffle, ham, gruyère cheese ie...Mac and Cheese. It was so yummy, the truffles and cheese just blended into this amazing flavor--I kind of have this obssession with mac and cheese..if it's on the menu, it must be ordered.

Our waitress was constantly checking on us, but not in the annoying intrusive kind of way...just the right amount of checkin up. After dinner....a bottle of VERY nice champange came out and the boy proposed again....and we were given a congratulatory desert compliments of the chef, amidst my tears. A Mix Candy bar....YUM. I can't even describe it other than it was delicious. The sorbet that complimented it was so good too. We finished off with the madelines and nutella, which was really a nice touch.

It was an amazing night, one I will never forget. We also had an awesome couple sitting next to us that had just gotten married...and we ended up going out and hitting up the clubs with them. A newly engaged couple and a bride in her wedding dress....we had an awesome night!

We decided to try out this restaurant for one of my gf's last weekend as a single girl. The Entrees, appetizers were phenomenal and well worth the price. Dessert was mediocre, though, which was surprising considering that the chef is French. We ordered wine recommended by their sommelier and it was perfect. The drinks were a bit pricey but it's Vegas so what do you expect. With such a large party, we decided to partake in the tasting menu which was out of this world.

We sat outside on the balcony, which was a great table and an AMAZING view. I had the ""special"" (which sounds like they have pretty often from the reviews) of filet, foie gras, and black truffle. I split a Cobb Salad with a friend, which I expected to be MUCH smaller than it was. If you aren't super hungry you could just do the Cobb for dinner. The steak was excellent & perfectly cooked, and the foie gras very nice. The truffles were really, really lacking. I honestly didn't smell or taste them, weird considering there were two large slices on top. I even tried to put a little slice on some of the potatoes but...nothing.

The madeline dessert with Nutella was YUM YUM YUM. The dessert list was impressive but this complimentary dessert was sooo good, most of us left the shared dessert for others. 

Great decor, excellent service, excellent view, very very good food. Not a bargain, but for an occasion or just to try a great restaurant in Vegas it was worth it.",G7iChdJcjFEJilPA2FsTKA,1,1,5,EURB1ydBL96wgPU3Yc00DQ
4073836,2014-01-15,3,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"So my gf and I were in Vegas for the new years and we were dying to try foie gras (which is illegal in CA) and a lot of people recommended to us MIX. Luckily, we were staying in Mandalay bay so we just walked up to MIX and went up to the elevator which took us to the 64th floor.

First off, the lounge at Mix is amazing! Since Mandalay is at the end of the strip, you get a full view of the strip and you can really appreciate the lights of Vegas. Additionally, the chairs are comfy and the heat lamps will keep you cozy.

As for the restaurant, the decor is all white and very chic. You start out by walking through the open kitchen which is really cool. We were able to get a table next to the window, which made no difference since our backs were to the windows.

As for the food:

Assorted bread with sea salt butter and peanut butter- 5/5- Hey it's free bread, anything at this restaurant that is free is a 5/5 for me. XD

Foies Gras filet mignon- 5/5- For $60, I was pretty disappointed when the plate came out and there was a tiny piece of meat. However, this baby must be made from dehydrated food because it expands quickly in your stomach! The foie gras pretty much melts in your mouth and the flavor is really strong and decadent. I definitely, recommend this dish at MIX.

Mash potatoes- 3/5- Pretty plain. Kind of tastes like instant mash potatoes to me...

Creamy Spinach- 3/5- Nothing out of the ordinary here.

Wagyu Beef- 4/5- This baby just melts in your mouth. However, it's a little bit salty for my taste. Luckily, the potatoes and carrots offset some of the saltiness.

Overall, the food is overpriced; however, the dishes are very flavorful here and the decor and view is top notch. If you're tired of the buffet scene, this is definitely, a worthy try.",acoVn9Vbp0fnuc3n-1M2EA,3,1,4,BpjZDNzXR5h5z8I2nzqbZQ
4079385,2011-10-08,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I had high hopes for a special splurge dinner while in Vegas and this was a horrible place to bet on.  I'll get the food out of the way---we had two entrees that were both amazing, fish cooked to perfection with some very unique flavors...the rest of the experience was horrible and the food doesn't make up for it.  Here are a summary of my issues:
1.  No one at the top of the elevator, and no staff in the bar so we sort of wandered around aimlessly until we walked through the dining room and found a host---and  she was rude and not very welcoming.  
2.  She sat us at a table, our first interaction with a staff member was 20 minutes later when the waiter who was running around like he was the only one in the whole restaurant told us it would be just a second and he'd come over...
3.  Another 20 minutes or so and he took our wine orders and told us the specials but didn't take our food order...
4.  At that point I was ready to walk out and I am typically the one telling my boyfriend to relax etc and give people a chance, at this point I was like lets go...but we had planned this etc and were really looking forward to it and it was really late.  
5.  We got our food, just the two entrees, after almost an hour and half---we skipped any apps at this point because we wanted to be done before breakfast.  Oh, and after an hour they brought our two glasses of wine, one of which was wrong (brought a red instead of the white we ordered) but we weren't going to attempt to see how long it would take for the correct one.  
6.  They must have told them to push the desserts because after the entrees the waiter was all over us until we said no, at which point it again took way longer than necessary for him to get our check etc.  
7.  After the experience I realized that I felt so tense during it because our waiter, who didn't have an absurd number of tables, and they were all just tables of two, was in such a tizzy he made me feel anxious and like I should be in a tizzy, only I was the one stuck with wine I hadn't ordered waiting for food.  
8.  The people that were seated 45 minutes after us ordered after they had been at the table only 15 or so minutes---right after we got to order.  

The tables that were already seated when we got there all skipped dessert and it appeared had similar slow waiting experiences since they all seemed to have chatted enough to get to know one another and made comments to other tables about how they weren't going to wait for dessert.  

Coming from DC and being used to paying for restaurants on the expensive end Mix set a new low for HORRID service.  

Go for it, tell the guys at the elevator downstairs that you want to go up and get a drink and look out the balcony, don't waste time paying for a drink, and skip the meal unless you want to commit hours of your life---honestly there are other places where you can pay less, get good food, get a view, and be treated like individuals who are respected and wanted.  

My advice, don't go and don't waste your time...oh but there is a cool view of the strip from the elevator which is on the exterior of the building.",yQjFM7F2KHl5rQoNKYfhTA,1,0,1,w8IIQmzOuwR_GoZ6HNePjA

It has such a very romantic atmosphere with candles lit on all of the tables.  Our waiter was so very helpful, my husband and I are from a small town so him explaining exactly what was what on the menu and giving us his personal opinion was greatly appreciated, and his attitude toward us was awesome to say the least, he was so friendly. My husband ended up ordering just a beer to drink but I ordered a blue martini (can't remember the name now) but it was amazing! Perfect, with a cherry at the bottom! For dinner we each ordered the strip steak. I cannot begin to describe how juicy it was! Probably one of the best steaks that I've ever had! I'm sure my husband would say the same. The chef really does care about the people that come in to eat his fabulous food, while your in between waiting for your drinks and dinner he sends out taste testers which were also amazing. For desert, we ordered (with help from our fabulous waiter) Grandpa's Hat which is a chocolate covered souffle. The very special part of this amazing dessert was it was in the shape of a cowboy hat and had cherries that were soaked (and when I say soaked, I mean WOW) in bourbon inside the souffle and a couple on the plate with some cherry sauce.

Went here for a business dinner and stopped off at the lounge first with a large group.  The lounge has a upscale vibe, contemporary decor and beautiful view.  Head straight to the outside balconies and check it out.  Most Amazing view atop the Delano Hotel behind the Mandalay Bay.

The restaurant is all white decor with touches of red with a humongous white bobbled centerpiece chandelier that you cannot miss.  There are large tables for groups and cute mini-egg shaped booths for two.  We did the pre-fix menu which included wine pairings and were somewhat disappointed. Each entry basically consisted of tiny miniature food on large white plates.  I don't care for food that needs to be explained and that's basically what this was.  Every time a new course was served we were all trying to figure out what it was.  There were a few items that seemed as an attempt to woo you into thinking they were trying to hard such as a pina-colada flavored warm cocktail served in a martini glass.  Not the most refreshing.  And a madeline cookie for desert.  Not what you would expect from a high-class restaurant.

The women's restroom did offer a view although not easy to appreciate through the glare of the restroom lights.  Not that its the best viewing area, go outside for that.

Although we did not care for the food, giving it 4 stars for the Lounge view and the wonderful service by our waiter and attentive staff.  They were attentive without being instrusive and extremly friendly.

If you never had foie gras, you are truly missing out. It tastes nothing like liver. It's buttery, smooth, with a hint of beef that melts in your mouth. Almost like bone marrow. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#qWfPRp-VH7u53bmJ3Pgvrg
Almost everything about this dish was perfect. The sear, sauce, and texture was right on. The only element of the dish I disliked was the chutney.

The mixed bread, butter, and peanut butter spread were irresistible. I couldn't help but sample each style of bread and top it with the peanut butter. We ended up ordering 3 baskets of bread and extra peanut butter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#Mng-hX8Y9JKqZ2IH8u7l_A

My girlfriend ordered the main lobster salad and my daughter order the braised wagyu. Sorry no pics. I was busy adoring my foie gras. The salad had a gratifying amount of lobster meat and the wagyu beef texture was tender and bursting with flavor. Three thumbs up from the eaters. There was enough sauce leftover from the wagyu that I was able to soak it up with the mixed bread. I made a treat of out it. 

We finished the dinner with a chocolate soufflé coupled with pistachio ice cream. The scent of chocolate drifted to the table next to me enough to turn heads and ask what I ordered. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#-AjWEQfqJ1tUGr92HgBxDQ
It was warm chocolate heaven. The pistachio ice cream can be a hit or miss depending on your taste buds. 

Mix has a spectacular view of Las Vegas. There is outside seating in the balcony but it was just too hot to even consider. The decor is light, hip, and trendy with the chandelier as the main attraction. The service was excellent. As for the wines, I didn't order any this time so I can't give a review.

Now paying $15-18 for a drink isn't in my price range--pretty much never.  But I came to terms that I'm also paying for the view.

The line wasn't even that long - probably around 30 feet long. The cover for Saturday night was $25 - that would have been fine had the place actually been fun. 

You ride the elevator to the 64th floor - it's a glass elevator, so you see yourself rising and floating above the Strip. That was cool. The view is AMAZING. The place definitely has the view going for it - you see all of the strip from Luxor to Paris to Stratosphere. The place has a trendy decor, and the drinks were strong. 

It must have been old people night and the DJ was playing remixed 1990s songs. The DJ sucked. All the songs were given an electronic beat. I wasn't feeling the music, and it was hard to dance.

Personally, I just want my chair to be comfortable. But what a view we did have. Overlooking the strip from the top of ""THE hotel"" tower. We would have loved to hang out in the lounge, but the way we felt after dinner, all we wanted to go was get back to the hotel room. (More on that later)

We had the 6-course special, and admittedly it was delicious. Small, tasty portions. The service was sterile. A robot set to ""polite"" could have done the job. And that's fine; I'm guessing the staff tends to allow the view to speak for itself. There was something, though, that really put a damper on the whole meal. By the fourth course, we were both more full than we've ever been in our lives. Now, we like to eat. Sometimes even to the point of gluttony. But we've never felt like this. Full, bloated, stuffed. Those words don't even begin to describe it. It was to the point of sickness, and we had to get out of there. Except, instead of simply boxing our food up and getting us our check, the wait staff seemed to be on autopilot and insisted on continuing our meal courses. So instead of making a hasty exit (it was urgent), we had to wait around another 20 minutes to get our check.

It's entirely possible our fullness had nothing to do with the meal. But I would say it was highly unlikely...we both experienced the same thing and had to skedaddle post haste. Would I go here again? Maybe if I won big and had cash to burn.

Started off our Saturday night here. Concierge had put us on the guestlist, so it was free for girls and $10 for guys to get in. 
Took the elevator up to the 64th floor, and the setup was pretty cool. The DJ was playing some decent house music. 
Got a Whiskey on ice ($10) and two martinis ($13 each) and hit the patio to enjoy the view. 
It was a pretty hot night, so the patio felt like a damn sauna, but we hung out for a little while and enjoyed the view of the whole city. 
After a little while, the DJ decided to switch up her playlist from house to rap from the 90's (as far back as 2Pac - ""I get around""). 
The girls wanted to dance, so we grabbed some more drinks and went to the little dance floor. It can't be more than 20x20, and I don't think there's a sound system/speakers there, but we still had a good time. 
Bartenders were all cool, and so was the crowd, and since we were there so early (from around 11:30 to 1a), there wasn't a wait for drinks.

The atmosphere, decor, views etc, are amazing! The view overlooking the strip at night is really pretty fantastic.

The service was so so. We sat in the lounge before dinner, and we could not get service and the place was not very busy. The dinner service was decent and our server was a nice guy, he was just slow. And towards the end of the night, he was downright holding us hostage.

Food was hit and miss... For apps, we had the tuna tartar and the shrimp cocktail. The tuna was pretty good. They could have had a few more ""chips"" on the plate. The shrimp cocktail was more like a salad. It was unique and delicious.

For dinner, we had sea bass and filet, and mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. The sea bass was ok. Filet was good. I ordered the filet with pepper crusted with a side of black pepper corn sauce. That was pretty tasty. The mac and cheese was sooooo yummy, and quite frankly, the highlight of this meal. The mashed potatoes were decent. The creamed spinach was forgettable.

For dessert, we ordered the candy bar. It was a hazelnutty delight topped off with a lime coconut sorbet.

The stars must've been aligned on the particular night that our group of 15 wanted to go out and about somewhere near by and for cheap...a handful of us were walking through the adjoining Mandalay Bay casino to meet up with other friends who were staying at one of the penthouse suites at THE Hotel.  Along the way a few well dressed young looking guys gave us passes to Mix telling us guys would get in for free.  We met up with everyone in the suite, got our drank on, and headed back down to the Mix.  Sure enough not only were the gals free, but the guys were too.  We then took an elevator ride back up to Mix...

-the dance floor is relatively small
-good mix of music to make you get up and dance

Complimentary bread basket- The bread basket included foccacia, fruit and nut bread, wheat bread, and baguette. The fruit and nut bread is the best piece of bread I have ever tasted. It was very moist, warm, and absolutely delicious. It wasn't too sweet or to oily, it was so good that we got seconds. The focaccia bread wasn't that special and tasted a little strange to me. 

Complimentary foie gras- We all got a small tasting of foie gras and it was pretty good. I only ate a bite though, because the feeling of goose liver haunts me. 

1. Surf and Turf (lobster and chicken) $38 - This is what I called surf and turf. I love how they use chicken instead of beef, much healthier. I usually eat chicken and lobster every other day, so my palate was designed to taste this dish. The chicken was awesome, and it was stuffed with spinach. It was soft moist and not oily. The stuffing was beautifully placed inside the chicken. The lobster was pretty decent, but not the best I have tasted. The portion size for this dish was very generous and filling. 

2. Seared Scallops $38- There were only three scallops on the plate, but what can you expect. I have learned to ask the server how many scallops before ordering them, because the usual is 2-4. The scallops were cooked very properly and were very tender. The only complaint is the portion size, because the other two parties had to fill up on the bread. 

3. Creamed Spinach $9- Ordered with less cream. I didn't ask how it tasted like, but it looked like he enjoyed it.

4. Sauteed Asparagus $9- A moment of heaven with vegetables. My mom usually cooks some of the best vegetables in the world, so I love to eat vegetables, but at the same time I hate flavorless vegetables. It was the best couple of asparagus spears I have ever tasted. It was so soft, moist, and full of flavor. Absolutely amazing. It is a must order sied to go with the meal.

Complimentary dessert- The chef never lets you leave without something sweet. We were offered each one madeline with a chocolate dipping sauce and it was wonderful. The perfect way to end a meal without stuffing yourself.

Our waiter was kind and polite even when we wanted to change tables. He always refilled on beverages whenever needed, and didn't stand over us like a school teacher. We were surprised that out entrees arrived so quickly ( I wasn't even finished with my first loaf of bread), because it was a busy night.

The space of the restaurant itself is open, modern, and fun. The balcony near the restrooms gives one of the best possible views of Vegas - spectacular.

Breads

Nice variety in the bread basket. The 2 butters I had were plain and home made peanut butter. The PB was unlike any PB I've ever had, so so good.

Ok not great. Did the job but nothing to write home about.

Starter - Foie Gras
Very flavorful and delicious. Of course, very rich as well so I am happy they offer a half portion. Nice touch.

Main - Chicken

I was told they feed it milk and not greens so it is much more moist. And it was very good, not as good as the Jean Georges moist chicken that is my standard. But a very complete plate --- the cous cous, veggiesn different presentation of the chicken. A very satisfying dinner plate.

Dessert - Mix candy bar

Delicious (unless you don't like hazelnut). The bar paired perfectly with the gelato as well and the portion size was just right. Reminded me of the highly recommended hazelnut dessert at The Modern in nyc.

Post dinner sweet -- Fresh madeline with chocolate spread.

Nice touch and very fresh.

All in all an excellent meal. Great value in my opinion as well. In fact, if you want to get a taste of high end dining, be full when you leave, have an amazing ambiance, do the chicken and a dessert here ---- at 39 dollars is about as good as it gets.

The sauce was light and nothing spectacular, albeit the scallops were seared perfectly. The seating was a bit awkward, as we were seated and a round table at the edge of the restaurant near one of the large points of view where you can look out into the city. I sat in a position where I was directly facing a couple who were seated directly facing me. No sir, I am not checking you out...you just happen to be where the view is. 

The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3? The boyfriend ordered from the  Christmas menu, in which he chose a raw & cooked vegetable tart as an appetizer, beef filet mignon as an entree, and Christmas log as the dessert for $95. The appetizer was very rich in truffle sauce. The entree, which was the star of the meal, consisted of shiitake gratin, pommes Anna, and bordelaise sauce. The shiitake gratin was spectacular! I could eat them nonstop. The filet mignon was also cooked to perfection, not too chewy. The Christmas log was a standard small roll cake. I had the roasted pineapple dessert, which was a pineapple cake on the bottom, with roasted sliced pineapples on top, pineapple chips and sauce. It was delicious. At the end of the meal, one of the chefs walked by and offered freshly baked madeleines. Best madeleine I've ever had in my life.  Also, service was very attentive and courteous. :)

I would consider coming back for a prix fixe menu, but only if I got a table with the view of the city. The view from the side of the restaurant outside is lovely as well (although too cold for winter, brr).

One last thing, as beautiful as the view in the bathroom is, the stalls were not up to par for an upscale restaurant. The white paint looked like it was coming off and there were no designs anywhere to be seen. It didn't seem elegant at all (after you see the view and walk to a stall, you'll see what I mean).

You walk through the dark black and red lounge into the uber-modern, all white, all open dining space littered with tables. Beautiful, yes, but a place you can settle in for a relaxing, private meal? Definitely not.

Las Vegas is all about spectacle, and Mix definitely has that. But everything from the doorstop of a wine menu to the 18 different servers who hover over you as you eat discourages complete enjoyment. You're so busy trying not to look un-chic that you forget to have fun.

And the food--excellent, no question. I had the curried lobster and my fella had the bison tenderloin. The portions were small but impeccably cooked and flavored. The bison was so tender, it made me angry at every other steak I'd ever had. The prices are quite high, even for Vegas. The cocktail list is all sweet, flavored vodka drinks--they want you to drink wine anyway.

Bottom line--great food overwhelmed by a snooty vibe and personality-less service.",WdKOEI6KrGHK9gCBVZ_t2Q,0,0,3,Te_HOCgqeiqLDkyRNS3r2A

There is a spiral staircase in the middle, private 2 person booths line the restaurant so you can see the view, and the place is a decked out in white. They accent it with bits of red to add a contrast. That is probably where my favorites of this place end. 

I had the spicy crab salad, it had chunks of crab and avocado and veggies. It was just ok. Other people in the party ordered the fish, the free range chicken which was very moist, and the filet. Everything was just kind of bland and nothing special. My favorite thing was the walnut and raisin bread which I asked for seconds. The bread comes with regular butter and a peanut butter flavored butter. That was very interesting.  I liked how at the end they give you a complimentary madeline with a hazelnut (basically nutella) dip.

4607469,2015-05-12,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"In sum -- good food overall, but a bit inconsistent. Some dishes were absolute standouts (the lobster au curry is one of the best things I've ever eaten), but some big misses as well. Service was excellent, and the view (from the top floor of the Delano, formerly THEhotel at Mandalay Bay) is beautiful.

I did the signature tasting menu ($120), which has four courses, and my husband did the Taste of Mix tasting menu ($90) which has five.  They have completely different dishes, so we got to share and try a lot of stuff.  I also really wanted the chocolate souffle for dessert and they were kind enough to sub this in for the dessert on my tasting menu at no extra charge.  Great service!  

The portions on the tasting menu are huge for a tasting, so come hungry and pace yourself.

The bread basket had 4 different kinds of bread, and we were given two of each.  It was good but not great.  Their homemade peanut butter was the most memorable part of the bread & butter.  

The amuse of smoked salmon-infused cheese & potato chip was yummy.

My first course was the gnocchi with peas and mushrooms.  This course was a big miss for me.  The gnocchi were mushy and the sauce did nothing for the dish.  

Fortunately my second course was the lobster au curry, which was absolutely amazing.  Big chunks of tender lobster meat served atop an absolutely delicious curry sauce and the creamiest coconut rice I've ever had, all topped with little crunchy things (super helpful description, I know, I'm just not sure what they were) that gave the dish great texture.  This was so, so, so good.

My third course was the filet mignon topped with foie and black truffles.  Oof, it was so rich I could hardly eat it but it was also so good.  Obviously the foie and black truffles were fantastic additions, but the filet itself was perfection and just melted in my mouth.  

There's a ""palate cleanser"" before the dessert course, but it's not the tiny shot you normally get, it's a full-size pina colada served in a normal martini glass.

The chocolate souffle was not great, but also not the worst one I had this weekend (that ""honor"" goes to Joel Robuchon).  The flavor of the souffle itself was lacking, but it had a ribbon of chocolate sauce near the bottom that provided some much-needed chocolate flavor.  The pistachio ice cream that came with it tasted homemade and was great.

My husband did the other tasting menu which had five courses: 1) dungeness crab salad, 2) foie gras, 3) seared scallops, 4) lamb loin and 5) Mix candy bar (homemade candy bar with chocolate, peanut butter and graham cracker) for dessert.  I sampled most of these and they were all pretty good but I didn't like them as much as my dishes overall (admittedly, my menu was more to my particular tastes).  We both thought it was strange that the foie was served just by itself and not on top of bread as it is normally.  It's a little too rich without the bread.

We were both stuffed by the dessert course and asked for most of our desserts to go.  Shockingly (sarcasm in case you can't tell), they agreed to box it up for us like a normal restaurant and didn't refuse like another fancypants place.  Our waiter saw the busboy taking away our mostly untouched desserts and asked with great concern if there was something wrong and if he could bring us something else on the house.  We explained that we were just full, but I very much appreciated the attentive service.  We didn't get mignardises, probably because we hardly touched our desserts (which is fair, I understand they don't want to waste food), but it would have been a nice touch if they'd boxed these up to go too.

The view from the restaurant is really nice, with a great view of both the strip and the mountains in the distance.  After dinner, they invite you to go to the lounge if you'd like, which I understand would otherwise have a cover charge.  The dining room is really pretty (nice decorations inside, and a lovely outdoor area as well), but it felt a little weird eating there because it was almost totally empty at peak dinner time of 7-9 pm.  It was Sunday though, which is probably their slowest night.  

This doesn't compare to Picasso (my favorite fine dining in Vegas), but it was definitely a good meal and I'm glad we came.  If you come here, you MUST order the lobster curry.",Wxd-EKF2Z4RHZUmwQ6Eeew,5,1,4,WDWaOpJmpE176YcBkrwk0w

It also has a patio area which will be great for the summer or late spring. As you walk in, you will see the hostess stand and that's the second, restaurant part. Everything is white in the restaurant, Tables are fairly small fitting a party of 2 perfectly. Along the side by the french windows, they have booth seating. 

As requested in my reservation, we got a table by the window. it is a small round table, very intimate and cozy for two people. As soon as we sat down, the server came to us and gave us a full introduction of the menus and wine list. We came here on Christmas Eve so we ordered their prefixed menu. 

For Appetizer we had the Seared Diver Scallops. It is golden on the outside, tender on the inside yet you can taste the freshness of the Scallops together with the a slightly taste of the herbs. For Entree, we got Fillet Mignon medium rare. It came just the way I like it. We also had a raw tuna dish but I don't remember the name exactly. One thing I do remember about that dish is the sauce they use, unlike other sushi place, they didn't give the standard wasabi and soy sauce, instead, they offer whipped egg white, vinegar and the olive oil. I was really impressed after I tried it. We got a small cake for desert, nothing really special about the cake and a specialty drink from the restaurant. 

I would say it is a good place for a romantic dinner, especially for those who are going to celebrate any special occasions.

But then the food came.  The first course was actually decent.  I ordered the prawns appetizer, which had excellent crustacean flavor, but not quite worth the $28.  My girlfriend had the gnocchi, which was good, but again, not spectacular.  For the entree, I ordered the bison.  Again, a decent piece of meat, but nothing memorable.  The peppercorn crust was far too heavy, which made me think that the chef was trying to mask the dull flavor of the underlying meat.  My girlfriend had the lobster au curry ($58), which is supposedly one of Alain Ducasse's signature dishes.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, but the sauce did nothing to enhance the flavor of the lobster, which left the dish tasting limp.  

While we were pretending to enjoy our entrees, the waiter came by to remind us that both were written up in magazines (Bon Apetit I think he said).

4670143,2014-02-22,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and I had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Mix.  On one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a Saturday evening in Vegas for a seven hour event.  

So, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  Edit: looks like I have to trim my review, I hit the 5000 character limit. :-(

1) Ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate Mix.  There is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  The interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.

The main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  If you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  If you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  I recommend after dark for balcony seating.

2) Service - I've never had a bad experience at Mix.  My wife and I visited Vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at Mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  We did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  Drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.

We've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  I'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.

3) Special requests.  They've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  For example, on our first anniversary when we went back, I arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to Mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  The restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  If you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.

4) FOOD!  Okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  Here's what we've had and when:

a) The pepper crusted bison tenderloin, cod brandade and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  The bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  On the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.

b) Surf & turf.  Although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  My wife gets this religiously and loves it.  I will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from N9NE at the Palms.  There's regular surf & turf, then there's Mix's surf & turf, then there's the N9NE surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.

c) Filet mignon rossini with foie gras & black truffle sauce.  If you're into truffles, I'm sure you'll love this.  The steak comes out perfectly.  I'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  Perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.

d) Roasted maine lobster ""au curry"".  I love spicy, I love Indian food, I love this meal.  It's my go-to Mix meal; I get it every time once I tried it.  It's perfect combo of everything I love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.

Don't forget to go visit the Mix Lounge next door after dinner!  Great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).",vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,1,1,5,C4n0AU17x-tOoo_ISRBT6Q
4670468,2010-08-25,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Go to MIX LOUNGE for unparalleled views of the southern end of the strip.  Seriously, the view is insane!

We came to MIX on a Saturday night on a whim after I had proposed to my then girlfriend.  We had a large group and didn't want to pay ridiculous money to get into a club, and we happened upon a MIX worker with free passes.  BINGO!

The first thing you'll notice about MIX is just about the only thing you'll notice: the VIEW.  The floor to very-tall-ceiling windows allow for a view of the strip you've never imagined.  The dancefloor is situated at the corner of the building and gives you about a 270 degree view.  

The balcony is where everyone wants to be, so you have to fight the crowd to get an outside look at the strip.  But trust me, its well worth it.

The decor is trendy modern/contemporary.  Though I didn't use them, I heard the restrooms have an equally impressive view.  Who wouldn't want to poop with a view?  The better question is why I didn't use the restrooms in the 4 hours we were at the lounge, but that's for me to figure out and you to feel awkward about now.

I had to subtract one star for the exorbitant prices for EVERYTHING at the bar:

Water?  That'll be $10. 
Beer?   That'll be at least $8.
Cocktail?  That'll be at least $12  ""YOU FOOL!!!"" (stated in Dark Helmet's voice from Spaceballs)

We got a nice corner table with a gorgeous view of the strip. We dined at Michael Mina @ Bellagio the night before for our wedding anniversary and were not quite impressed but this place more than made up for it. 

The bubbly rose moscato wine was by far one of the best glasses of wine I've had. The complimentary bread was a bit disappointing .. it was way too hard to be chewed and digested properly.. 

We ordered 2 entrees after consulting our server for recommendations
- cod brandade: This was by far one of the best seafood dishes ever to have gone down my throat. The cod was perfectly cooked and had great flavor and spices to go with it. 

- maine lobster curry with coconut basmati rice: Believe it or not this was my first lobster dish... the lobster itself was a bit chewy but the rice and the curry made the whole dish very delectable

the chocolate souffle was served in a ceramic case and was extremely delicious although I would have preferred more of the pistachio ice cream on the top

the best part was the complimentary madeleines served fresh from the oven .. perfect way to end the meal .. on our way out we had a sneak peek at the lounge but since we had to go somewhere else we did not have enough time to check it out .. definitely a must do for next visit ...",B4Rwp0SUYwO8lgSHVT9w5g,0,0,5,0tnieeOtYHLjTtfZUC_MAQ

My buddy arranged it with the mix lounge front desk that we would get reservation/bottle service and no cover before midnight...sounded perfect since we were all still hurting from going hard the night before. We did some pre-drinking in our rooms and headed down there by 11'ish...only to find out that the elevator is stuck! The cocky guy standing at the front desk asks for our number and said he'll call us if they get it fixed. Calls us 15 minutes later telling us that they won't be opening it up for the rest of the evening.... totally putting a wrench in our plans/wallet since we're gonna have to go some where else to party. Instead of referring us and moving our reservation to rum jungle or one of their affiliates, he basically said sorry and offered his connections to some other clubs some where outside of the hotel...and of course, nothing is free....we said forget it and we went with a different route that night.

We got here pretty late thinking it would be really poppin' by this time.  There were a decent amount of people there but not packed by any means.  

Hit the bar up first to grab a cocktail before we walked to check out the scene and the spectacular view.
This is when things just seemed really off. 

There appeared to be 1 bartender and then after hanging around for about 5 mins, another bartender surfaced but neither seemed to know what was going on or where their spirits were to make the requested cocktails by anyone. 

Once we finally got to put our drink order in, the guy had to run to the other end of the bar to grab the needed items.  On top of that, he had sweat dripping from his head.  Really?  

I don't want to go on and on talking about how much I didn't enjoy this place but I just can't seem to understand how this place has so many great reviews.  

View - pretty spectacular, but small area.  Not good sound for those wanting to hang out outside.  

Music - started with a good mix of old school hip hop and then just went sideways.  

Bar - left lots to be desired. 

Crowd - very varied, not a good mix. 

Vibe - has potential but appears to not be the ""hot"" spot anymore.

For main course, ordered the pork loin with chorizo bits and grits ($38) and it was less than amazing. the pork was very tough, ended up eating mostly the grits. the best pork i've ever had was at mesa grill in ceaser's palace.
For dessert, got the chocolate volcano with mango sorbet ($12), which was chocolate covered chocolate mousse and very good.

4727162,2011-09-30,2,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"This place is delicious, and really just outstandingly beautiful. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday last year because I found it online at Restaurant.com and looked at the reviews and the restaurant website, and was sold when I saw that #1 it's Alain Ducasse (whose restaurant itinerary is an impressive 24 restaurants at the moment and who has his own culinary school in Paris- a true pioneer of French cooking) and #2 I saw pictures of the restaurant. If you look at my picture you'll know what I'm talking about. The impact of the ceiling to floor hand-made blown glass sphere's that surround an intimate and prestigious table for one in the center of the restaurant really takes your breath away. And actually, we learned from our waiter, that the table placed in the middle of this glass ceiling jewelry is no longer allowed to be used, because it is not handicap accessible (they're stairs).

For dinner we had ZERO complaints, which pretty much has not happened for me at any restaurant. One of the best dining experience of my life. Here's what my girlfriend and I enjoyed for dinner:

Shared appetizer:
TENDER POTATO GNOCCHI with sunchoke, Parmigiano Reggiano and  veal jus. The BEST gnocchi I've ever tasted. Tender is an understatement.

Entrees:
ROASTED MAINE LOBSTER ""AU CURRY"" with coconut basmati rice. Speechless, just speechless.

COD BRANDADE with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons & fried parsley. Those croutons were basically a vehicle to supply your taste buds with a burst of butter, and that coupled with the largest capers I've ever seen (they were the size of peas!) and the fried parsley- just incredible.

Now that I've popped my Alain Ducasse cherry, I will definitely be visiting Adour New York and Benoit New York when I have a large chuck of change burning a hole in my pocket. Oh, and if you go, check out the bathroom in Mix Lounge next door. You'll see what I mean when you get there.",9CxsqKccPc7Oi5_TRm3zEg,2,1,5,ZGWfa-1jp3N2jAutWyp1lQ

Everything is served a la cart so it's fun to share. Pricey but such is to be expected with restaurant like this.

A couple of weeks ago while vacationing in Las Vegas, I had the veal fillet with a creamy garlic sauce nestled on top of two different types of peas. This dish was immaculate. The veal was thickley-cut, tender, juicy and I savored each bite. 

We also ordered mixed sauteed mushrooms (mmm), mac n cheese (not your mama's kind), and fish dishes. The macadamia nut encrusted halibut was fresh and flaked to perfection!

2) FANTASTIC FOOD. I am really only going to mention the lobster served on top of coconut rice as it is one of the signature dishes of Alain Ducasse. Alain Ducasse is the first chef to own restaurants carrying three Michelin Stars in three cities. He's a pretty big name in europe and boy is there something really fantastic about his food. This dish sounds simple, but everything was cooked to perfection. I was afraid of an overpowering coconut flavor, but to my pleasant surprise it was perhaps the best coconut rice I have ever had. When I was done with the dish I REALLY wished I could pick it up and lick it clean. Truly finger-lickin-good. 

3) GREAT WINE: The wine selection was fantastic. Loved everything I had.

I wont say much more other than, please try this place. It is certainly pricey at nearly $50 an entree, but it will be well worth the money.

In the dining room there is a small second floor area, however  it is not available for any guests to use.

Don't forget to use the bathrooms!!! For the guys there is a window over the urinals with a view of the pools. And for the women, in the stalls the toilet is facing out because there are  windows out towards the Mandalay Bay. Check it out!

Usually around 10 pm people can buy a bottle/table outside, so if you are seated at a table outside in the lounge, they may ask you to move to another un-used table.

White Bean Veloute: The veloute itself is great. It's rich, thick, flavorful, but not too filling. The vegetable eggroll is confusing and not the best eggroll I've ever had, but still a nice start to the meal.

Colorado Rack of Lamb: Great sear and cooked perfectly. The lamb comes deboned and is the highlight of the dish. Would definitely order again

Lobster ""Au Curry"": WOW. After a summer of endless Maine lobstah rolls, I didn't think I could enjoy lobster until next summer. I snuck a bite of my friend's order and loved the way they prepared the lobster. It had that great seafood flavor and firm texture, without being too rubbery. You wouldn't think of curry as something you want to spend $50 on, but there was so much flavor and the rice made the dish complete.",xOkBDbq0qeI-syKaJKSBsw,0,0,4,FZWg4NKcjRJINOXQ_JWc8w

Classic Tasting menu:  
--Pre-Menu: A mouse, sooo good. It tastes like bacon but better. 
1. Potato Gnocchi with asparagus cream & pesto. AMAZING!! Everyone at the table agreed it was the best Gnocchi they had ever tasted. 
*** I added Tuna Tartare as well, it was tasty.***
2. Lobster Curry. OMG, Imagine the best tasting indian dish you ever put in your mouth with a melt in your mouth buttery lobster! 
3.Filet w/ Foire Gras. Cooked PERFECTLY. So good!!
--Passion Fruit Foamy Cocktail. I have no idea what the real name is, but it was a unique end to the meal. I will look forward to it again :)
4. Baba cake. Not my fav... I would probably sub this out because I need chocolate. I am not subtracting any stars for this because the view made up for the Meh dessert, plus everyone else at the table loved it, 
--After Dessert: Vanilla Cookies, fresh with nutella. 

View: If I could Give a view 10 stars, I would!! It was amazing!! Make sure you use the club restroom so you can have a view even while you go ;) 

Service: 10 Stars as well! Our server was very engaging an answered a ton of questions about the chandelier and history of the restaurant.

The food was all perfectly executed and surprisingly traditional French (I expected more contemporary American with French influences).

amuse-bouches was not impressive at all, pickled onion and little veggies like a very salty Korean banchan or Chinese salted vegetable. My bouche was not one bit amused.

For appetizer, the DH had the veggie terrine, which was perfect. I had a sea bream sashimi thing, which was very very fishy and rich, good for the first 3 bites and then a little too overwhelming. 

For main course, the DH had the special that day which was filet mignon with fois gras and truffles. this was the best beef we've ever had, and at $75, it had better be! (keep in mind that we've never been to a steakhouse, I'm just not that passionate about steak). 
I don't remember what I had, it was good, but not amazing, not nearly as good as the filet mignon...can't believe I don't rememer it, I always remember what I eat!!

pre-dessert--my favorite part of the entire meal-- this drink with mango, passion fruit and some other things at the bottom and coconut foam sort of thing on top, the coconut part was a little warm and mango part very cold, it was heavenly!!!

the dessert...oh the dessert was really really good-- I remember the champagne gelee and panna cotta with the 24k gold leaf on top being my favorite (maybe because both were fruit based). but all the desserts from the sampler tray were good. 

Uploading pictures of everything--this is where I wished I had brought my own camera rather than using the DH's point&shoot. 

after tax & tip and a restaurant.com $50 off, the bill came to about $220. Aureole downstairs in Mandalay Bay is still our favorite restaurant and about $50 less expensive. 

I'd give 4.2 stars for the food and 2.5 stars for the service, 4.5 stars for the decor. I loved the bubbles.",PaBOdDfrgs1n4qPWNlUARA,1,0,3,Dm1sFhut5lA73gcjYXGPRA

4851902,2012-06-24,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"This is a review for the restaurant, which I just walked out of 15 minutes ago. :)  My party and I chose to go for their better tasting menu which included four courses plus an amuse bouche and pre-dessert dish.  Here's the breakdown:

1. Amuse Bouche: Thai Coconut Chicken Soup aka Tom Ka Gai.  A nice touch, but I've had better Tom Ka Gai at my local thai restaurant.  Too much lemongrass, and not enough sweetness.  Not bad, but not great.

2. First Course: Gnocchi with Asparagus and Morels in a Cream Sauce.  I personally liked this dish, I felt that the delicate flavors were well balanced and a perfect introduction for what was to come.  My sister felt that this dish was a little on the bland side, but then again, she has a cold, so I'm not sure if her taste buds are fully functioning, lol.

3. Second Course: Roasted Maine Lobster ""Au Curry"" with Coconut Basmati Rice.  I was a little apprehensive when I saw ""curry"" and ""lobster"" in the same sentence, but this was actually a very unique and pleasant twist on how I normally experience lobster.  When dining at Gary Danko in San Francisco, my go-to dish is the Butter-Poached Maine Lobster with Risotto, and here we have a similar dish with an Indian touch...delicious!

4. Third Course: Filet Mignon Rossini with Foie Gras and Black Truffle.  I do love my Tournedos Rossini and MIX does it beautifully here.  My velvety filet practically melted in my mouth and the foie gras was richer than butter.  The chef was also very generous with the black truffle slices.  Definitely the star of tonight's meal!

5. Pre-Dessert: Mango Puree with Coconut Foam.  This light and airy precursor to dessert looked like a fancy cocktail served in a martini glass.  Exotic, fruity, and a refreshing palate cleanser after such a rich main dish!

6. Fourth Course/Dessert: Baba A L'Armagnac (Monte Carlo Style).  This was an Irish sponge cake drizzled with Armagnac and served alongside an airy vanilla bean whipped cream.  Decadent without being over-the-top, but I was still so stuffed that I could only finish half...what a waste!  Still, being a chocolate lover, I would have chosen a mousse or lava cake a la mode over this any day.  Sorry MIX!

I also had two glasses of the sparkling rose and an Irish coffee to accompany my meal.  The rose was nice, but the Irish coffee had such a kick that I could only finish half for fear of being unable to walk out of the restaurant!

The location, view, and decor was AMAZING!  I'm sure you've all seen photos of the ""floating"" glass bubbles that adorn the center of the restaurant.  The floor is also made to emulate a lace pattern.  Service was friendly, but unfortunately on the slow side.  It took them over 2.5 hours to serve us four courses.  Also, I felt like the price was a little on the high side for only four courses...I've eaten at comparable restaurants here in Vegas and in SF which cost about the same for 6-9 courses.  Nonetheless, I would still consider this a very good experience and is worth trying once.  But if you're going to do it, do it all the way and go with the higher tasting menu for the best the chef has to offer!",I7U1RW4Mk03sbDQGH-m4gw,3,2,4,7hg1jBdyMWaG2u96UOuKUQ

4872651,2012-10-03,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"The service was inattentive from the moment we arrived. We made our way through the 'club' (dark space with dark walls) with no cue or guidance from the staff. When we asked if we were headed in the correct direction we received a smug answer with a stone face. Making it to the host stand we checked in and waited awkwardly as they found a table for us in an otherwise empty restaurant (3 other tables in the main area) We were seated in a booth along the exterior of the dining room, it was comfortable enough. 
We observed several people walking by our table without acknowledgment taking at least 15 minutes to be spoken to by anyone who worked there. After we ordered dinner (two steaks, creamy spinach, and mac with ham- at the server's recommendation) we received a bread basket (it was okay but little did we know, the best part of the meal) the server assistant was polite and explained the basket with a smile. Dinner took a reasonable amount of time to deliver (25-30 min)   but was presented in a rather mediocre manner. The steaks had little color and no seared crispness to the crust (see the steak on the Excaliber Buffet Banner, it looked pretty similar) and came with a peppercorn sauce that had no trace of pepper and tasted of hormel packaged gravy. The garlic creamed spinach was rather bland with a demure garlic flavor, and the recommended mac and cheese was no better than purchased box mac with little chunks of deli ham in it. All items were under-seasoned and lacked the finesse of other fine dining restaurants. 
However on the plus side the portions are reasonable as are the prices for what you'll find in Vegas. We had a resort food credit so the meal was not a total loss, but I would definitely not spend my own money here.",uXf3jkDNM5oD2_GHLmKecQ,0,0,2,9W-Ik76PG9SZ30W2Wp5c4A
4885398,2011-12-20,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"DEcided to go here because it had steak on the menu and a pre-set menu.  When you get to the hostess they check your reservation and send you up an elevator up to the restaurant.   When you get off the elevator you step out into the lounge. The lounge has the nice view of Vegas.  As you pass the lounge, you pass the restaurants kitchen and get to another hostess that checks your reservation (kind of unnecessary, I think).  We waited for a little bit because we had to change the reservation to a smaller number. The restaurant is decorated nicely with clear bubble hanging from everywhere. The lighting is dim and romantic.  They say the dress is business casual but they let people with jeans in and funny holiday hats in as well (LOL!).  

I decided to order the filet mignon because I wasn't too hungry and I wanted steak. My bf ordered the lobster au curry and the foie gras as an appetizer. My filet mignon was good (not the best of I've had), but definitely easy to cut and it tasted nice with the white sauce they give you to eat. The lobster curry was delicious as well as the foie gras.  The foie gras was rich as usual so I would recommend the half size if you are eating it yourself.  The coconut rice with the lobster was a little mushy for my liking, but the curry and lobster was good mix. 

For dessert, my friends and I ordered the chocolate souffle. It was delicious and it looked like it was overflowing.  A good size to share with everyone. The rocky road ice cream that came with it was ok. and came with a merengue tasting cookie bits.  We also ordered the cheesecake. It tasted a little different (a little creamy vs. cream cheesy taste), but the sour cream sorbet and raspberry sauce that came with it was delicious.   

Bottom Line: Everything is pretty expensive. OUr bill came out to about $80 a person for 2 people.  I don't really think everything was worth the price though. View is excellent

4902135,2010-07-27,6,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"MIX is a nice upscale restaurant and chic lounge on the ""64th floor"" of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay.  It's not really the 64th floor, as the elevator skips a few numbers, but it is still a breathtaking view.  It is top notch in terms of dining and blew our hero's expectations away, even after reading its already spectacular Yelp reviews.  The modern lounge area is also very classy and has an amazing view of the Vegas strip from the south end.  This is definitely an excellent choice for wining and dining, and some low key drinks and dancing in a smaller lounge environment.

After ordering, our hero was presented with an amuse-bouche of lobster cocktail in a martini glass that was pleasant and well balanced between seafood and gazpacho flavors.  His main course of wagyu beef with vegetables in a pot was astounding: it flaked apart with just a fork and was so soft that it could be crushed between his tongue and the roof of the mouth without chewing.  Complimentary madelines with Nutella spread before the check were also a nice sweet touch from the chef as well.

This really is a restaurant that deserves its Michelin star and serves food at a price point that is affordable to any degenerate gambler that just won a spin of the roulette wheel at Mandalay Bay.

The lounge side of MIX is separated from the restaurant by a transparent glass enclosed kitchen.  It can also be accessed by a special elevator on the ground floor guarded by bouncers.  A small dance floor, narrow floor plan, and division of the lounge by a partitioning bar gives a feeling of privacy as opposed to large spread-out lounges.  There's also bottle service tables and a viewing area on the patio where our hero had a great photo-op of the strip.  The view alone is reason enough to visit MIX at night!

PROS:
- The view from 20-something floors up.  Even the windows at the urinals in the men's washrooms had a nice view!
- One of the best dining experiences of my life.  No joke.
- Friendly and attentive service.
- Cool modern decor.

CONS:
- The bread is somewhat bland and not even warm, and the butter is too hard to spread.
- Tables along the windows seem packed together fairly close and the noise level is a bit high such that you can hear your neighbors' conversations clearly.",gjh6da4yHahEpQ73O6DX_Q,9,6,5,Je21kTgtxf7eX0myJKNs-w

Didn't do the dinner here but came here twice on this random Vegas trip and got to do the club scene here up in the Mix. The drinks are pricey but it's worth a drink or two when you're out in the balcony looking down from the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay. Nice and windy up there.

And oh yah, plenty of different dj's throughout the night so you get a pretty good mix of music and dance songs to get your groove on on the floor. Seems the atmosphere of dress wear was also mixed but coming here somewhat dressy is also the preferred method of partying. But again, there is mix of both dressy and casual dressing throughout the evening on both my visits here.

Everywhere is pretty dark. Seating is usually reserved or if you got the bottle service, so if you come here early...like 11pm, then maybe you might get some seating. Otherwise it's pretty much standing room only everywhere you go. The urinal is cool but awkward since there is view of the outside from the 64th floor but at the same time, you're looking directly ahead at another set of urinals from across the hotel so there is a good chance you're making eye contact with a dude pissing at the same time.

We were bummed, but the interior decor is pretty cool to look at, with all the bubbles hanging from the middle of the room.

Once we ordered and told him we were starving, the food came out quickly. Four kinds of bread, including sourdough, french and dinner rolls. The bread was average but they include this homemade peanut butter that was to die for. My husband's first $16 martini was totally watered down. When he complained, they shouldn't have charged for it, and offered a second one to make up for it. My husband ordered the cod, which was unbelievable.

I remember MIX as having a staff that knows the menu inside out, how every dish was prepared and the best way to enjoy each course. Our waiter seemed like he was filling in for someone, having difficulty explaining the menu.

Bigeye Tuna Tartare & the Seabass were both delicious

Beyond the hip lounge is the restaurant.  From the lounge you walk through a corridor where you have an opportunity to view the open kitchen.  I like watching chefs work and this was a treat.  Then you step into a cream white colored paradise.  Feels like you stepped into a glass of bubble filled champagne.  

We ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu - go Three Squares!  The grilled foie gras was probably the best that I have ever had and I eat a lot of foie gras.  The foie is so much sweeter when it comes from corn fed ducks as opposed to pellet fed ducks (from Hudson Valley for example).  It shows that the chef knows how to source his ingredients.  

The rest of the dishes were delicious but I loved the cheesecake dessert.  The sweet fluffy and light mouse cheesecake was paired with a more savory sour cream sorbet which I loved!  The sorbet was such a surprise and delight that I forgot about the cheesecake.

The cocktails were good, the couchy-like seating is so comfy and luxurious, the staff is AWESOME.  Literally every 2 minutes they came to empty our ash tray (and we were not chain smoking), and our server was so friendly and down-to-earth which is unusual for a place like this.  The bathrooms are out of this world.  The toilet is basically facing a glass wall overlooking the strip.  I kind of wanted to sit there for about ten minutes but I didn't want  people to think I was pooping so I just enjoyed it for maybe 30 seconds longer than I needed.

The experience started when you walked into the elevator.  This restaurant is at the top floor of Mandalay Bay and only accessible by elevator with glass walls looking over the strip and airport as you ascend.  We walked through the bar area and found the podium hidden around the corner.  We were originally sat at a round table next to a big pillar opposite of everyone else in the restaurant, so we asked to move to a table with a view.  They did have a sense of urgency in moving us, however, ended up putting us further to the back of the restaurant by window with a view of NOTHING!  Not to be particular, but it was my birthday, so my friend asked the server to move us again with a view of the strip.  We were then taken outside on the last table in the back. Our view was of the airport (meh...) and the hostess walked away and grabbed a server and whispered something to him. This hostess was a lady with greasy mullet with a very ""stand off-ish"" vibe.  No bueno.   Aside from this, here's what we got:

I got the rack of Colorado lamb for $39.  It was cooked medium and perfect!  Served with eggplant and lamb au jus.  The flavors meshed well together.  Light, yet savory.  My friends had the braised wagyu (for $34) served in a small pot, with a flavorful gravy and veggies.  The wagyu was fork tender and AH-MAZE-ING!  My other friends had the venison and the ribeye.  Although I didn't try it, they seemed to enjoy the meal as well.  We also ordered three side dishes: 2 mac and cheese and french fries.  The fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, however the mac and cheese, serve with ham, was ""on point!""  So cheesy, so flavorful, so good!!  All in all, I'd say the food was 5 star all the way!

Mix is a wonderful place to dine on a super special occasion, like MY birthday (LOL).  At the end of the day, I was thoroughly impressed with the potential this place has on the typical dining experience.  For our party, it seemed that the service fell short in a couple of places.

Also-check out the bathrooms, they are a trip ( I have only heard about the ladies room). You HAVE to go for the evening view at least once.

The only reason I did not assign 5 stars is the following: It was a chilly night and Mix does have kerosene heaters near the tables. When we asked the manager to light ours up, he said he could not because there was not enough fuel to keep it lit though the entire night and he needed it  later for the ""club crowd."" That is a bad answer-At $16-$20 a drink you can buy more fuel. He did come through with some blankets for the women in our group though.",qnOkZ1mOfLVCIBPMfyOStg,6,2,4,A-YSjP4wVmuiyvYwVoqJ8w

In our group of four, me and my bf had the Taste of Mix tasting menu and got the wine pairing to go with it. The other two had the Classic tasting menu and wine pairing. The atmosphere is classy and looks beautiful at night. 

I don't remember the whole meal, but here are the things I do remember...
The amuse bouches were great. The first course was a salad which was just alright. The next dish had foie gras and apricot which was amazing. The entree I remember being good...I think it was lamb. The dessert was a ""candy bar"" which was rich and chocolately..but a little to heavy for my liking. Each glass of wine was very well paired with each course.

The mood of our meal changed drastically when I found a piece of thin GLASS in my wine. Yup...a piece of glass about the size of a half dollar. Luckily, it stuck to the side of my wine glass so I didn't get to my mouth. Also, the manager came over and apologized took off the cost of 2 wine pairings. They handled it well, but something like that should have never happened. Who knows what could've happened if I swallowed that piece of glass.",4RfpLt6TJi1x1mGrPakovA,0,0,3,pWXEcsQTMhSMIQhC0kTTZQ

The food and drinks were just ok.  Nothing notable to waste your time reading about.  I was told by the sommelier at Auerole that MIX is about to be renoed and turned into a different restaurant.   So that might be rad, something fresh!  Either way take a trip to the 6th floor of the Delano for this.

This place is a mystery to me. It has a phenomenal view of the strip and a cool vibe inside yet every time I am there its pretty empty. Maybe I am going on the wrong nights, maybe at the wrong times, but for as many times as I have gone up there I find it hard to understand how it's always so empty. The view is everything for me. It brings MiX from an average lounge to a 4 star lounge. It could use some T.L.C. and I'm not talking about the R&B group (""creep"" is their best song by the way).
It needs a refresh inside and I wish the patio was a bit wider. It's a shame to have that beautiful view and such a small patio (advantage Foundation Room). The decor and furniture is modern and fun but could also be updated a bit. The black paint inside could definitely be updated and changed to something more friendly and appealing.
They have a relatively small dance floor but it is encased by floor to ceiling windows overlooking the strip so I would say that makes up for it.
I don't really know what else to say here. I never really stay very long when I go to MiX. It's usually just drop in for a drink and take in the view to show some friends in town and then go on to another place. I had a hard time giving them 4 stars but I feel that 3 is too low. It's a shame because it has 5 star potential. I really hope that they invest some money into improving or re-branding MiX.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,1,4,ag5AqcENl56Tvxb72t_lSw

Even the view from the restroom is fantastic. The main dining room is very contemporary and minimalistic. Hundreds of hand-blown glass bubbles fill the area, so it almost feels like you're sitting in a glass of champagne. But what really sets this restaurant apart is the food. From start to finish, EVERYTHING we tried was EXCEPTIONAL. The one dish that really stands out in my mind was the Fillet Mignon Rossini. Being a big fan of foie gras, chef Alain Ducasse really hit a grand slam with this dish. It was easily the best steak I've ever had. On the downside, the prices are a bit on the upper end but you certainly won't be disappointed.

Part of the empire of famed, multi Michelin stared chef Alain Ducasse, miX finally lives up to expectations.

For starters, the gnocchi is outstanding.  Soft pillows surrounded by earthy, wild mushrooms, vegital asparagus, enveloped in a brown butter / rendered bacon sauce.  A perfectly balanced dish.  The foie with dates and lemon confit is a true embarrassment of riches.  Thick slices from the best part of the lobe, perfectly seared, served in its own melting fat; the sweet, fruity dates compliment, the tart, acidic zing from the lemon peel refreshes the palate.  Wow.

Mains deliver.  The lamb loin is delicious.  Moist, tender, perfectly cooked and rested but it's the accompanying pomme Anna that makes the dish.  Layer after layer of paper thin potato cooked as a ""pie"" in butter with a crisp, brown top layer.  Incredibly rich and is the perfect foil to the lean loin.  Not into lamb?  The filet mignon Rossini with foie and black truffles...OMG!  The sweet beef flavor is brought out by the Rossini sauce and its umame enhanced by the truffles.  The foie provides the perfect, fatty, unctuous balance to the dish.

Excellent service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Tip:  grab a drink on the balcony of the ultra lounge before dinner.  Incredible Strip view.  (Gets crowded later in the evening)

Hint:  high level Mlife members, for a window table, make reservations through the Mlife site.   Others, book at least 30 days in advance.  As is true on the Strip, be a baller.

The profiteroles were the smallest things I ever saw and I would have been pissed if I would have had to pay for those. The did not taste good at all either.

Our Server (Paul I believe) was pretty much perfect, full of personality and professionalism in one.  However, the reason we picked this place for a romantic dinner was because we had read that the 46th floor view was stunning.  

1) the view in the restaurant is NOT nice.  If you want a nice strip view, get appetizers and drinks in the lounge, but do not commit to a full dinner...you won't have a view

2) the seating along the window faces away from the window.  Not one person sitting at the window can see out of it without looking away from their dinner date

3) everything except for the red water glasses and pink tealight holders is white...EVERYTHING.  The well intended decor would be interesting, but instead it feels slightly like a mental institution with abstract curves and balls of glass hanging from the ceiling while offering nothing stimulating to look at.

Stick to the lounge.  We had a drink there after and instantly regretted the $300 meal we had in the restaurant with nothing but our waiter's service and personality to make the experience worthwhile",JQlzHruOqwMuueStY_9_DA,0,0,3,m1QaJAPzqW-Dq8sk3KDwAw

5149389,2011-07-30,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"This review is for the restaurant. 
My husband and I came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. I did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. The food was wonderful. We had, for starters, the seared duck foie gras (half order), tuna tartare (half order), and Maine lobster salad. For our entrees we had the braised wagyu and cod brandade. Both were very tasty. For my dessert I had the mix Candy Bar w/ caramel ice cream. 
My gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. It was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. At least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. My next gripe is with the waiter (big Caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. I wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. I forgot my Zantac, so I didn't think drinking wine would be wise. My husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, I don't know what to call him). By the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. My husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but I convinced him against it because I wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. We tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. With the foie gras and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. A good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. 
So the verdict: The food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.
I've been to many amazing restaurants, including French Laundry, Jar, Lucques, Osteria Mozza, etc... This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a fine dining establishment.",hXIdh0JEPPNkkJbUhM1UJQ,0,0,2,OBPPv7T3C3rB0URm-lfqSw

This is the place to go if you want something classy.  It's pretty small, which keeps the scene intimate and keeps a nice aesthetic.  The lounge is lined with booths and there is a decent size dance floor.  

The view is what really takes the cake though.  If you missed it on the elevator coming up you'll have ample time to enjoy it on the patio on the 64th story.  My recommendation?  GO TO THE BATHROOM.

I should have written this sooner so I could remember the details better, so apologies in advance for the made up names I'm using for the dishes! 

Started out with tuna sashimi appetizers and one of our party got the shrimp cocktail. Tuna sashimi appetizer had TONS of tuna on it. Seriously the portion was huge and an awesome value. Tuna was fresh and tasty. Dish wasn't super exciting or mind blowing.. but no complaints. People enjoyed the shrimp cocktail as well.

For mains we had the chicken, steak, and the cod. The cod was a tad rich and buttery for my taste, but it was well prepared and yummy. Steak was VERY good. For a non-steakhouse, I was very impressed. Chicken diner wasn't very excited by his chicken.

Dessert: the floating island didn't do it for me.. ehhhh.. kinda weird, not that tasty. The candy bar was ok, but not good enough for me to even eat half of. They gave away some sort of fresh baked madeleines with nutella at the end..  it was far yummier than any of the ""real"" desserts. I advise not to pay for a dessert but just eat the freebie one.. much better.

First off - if you get a waiter named Randy, you are set! He is so attentive and friendly (without being invasive). 

The ambiance of the entire room is like you're floating on a cloud - the glass bubbles that surround the central seating creates a fun vibe. We wondered why many of the tables near the window in the restaurant don't have the best view of the strip. We figured it was for two reasons: (1) So the Mix Nightclub and Balcony dining could have the amazing view; (2) So the diners would focus inward on the clean and bright decor. 

After reviewing the menu, Randy gave us his suggestions for dinner. Definitely get the Shrimp Cocktail with the spicy sauce to start. The horseradish isn't overwhelming since it's tempered by the tomato sauce. 

We also tried the Steak Rossini - one of Chef Ducasse's specialties. For my taste, it was a little heavy for me, but still very flavorful and tender. 

The Pepper-Crusted Buffalo is another great choice if you're looking for a leaner cut of beef. 

The star of the menu (in my opinion) is the Cod Brandade with lemon, capers, brown butter, and fried parsley. AMAZING doesn't begin to describe how velvety smooth this fish is prepared. It simply melts into your mouth and you wish that the dish will never end! 

If it's summer, try the asparagus as a side - they shave down the sides of the stalk, relieving some of that woody texture to it. Steamed, then finished in olive oil and butter, it'll make you want to finish all your vegetables. 

No dinner is complete without dessert....but what does MIX do? They bring you a complementary lemon cookie (WARM) from the pastry kitchen to be eaten with nutella. Wow!! But, don't you dare stop there! Be sure you have the Mix Candy Bar (and ask for another scoop of caramel ice cream to be served with it). Simply the perfect finish.

Atmosphere: Amazing. Just amazing. The atmosphere here is what keeps it at 2 stars and keeps it from plunging lower.

Drinks: The drinks were okay at first. Heavy handed pours made the drinks tasty and the prices were on par. I approached the bar after my first drink and asked if they had any port. I love port and usually have some during the evening. They poured me a glass of Fonseca 20 Year tawny port. The bartender had no idea how to serve it and, charging me 15 bucks for it, proceeded to pour it in a wine glass. The port had a good start but I distinctly tasted a horrible aftertaste of fungus. I've checked around the bottle that was served was well beyond it's ""sell-by date"" so-to-speak. The bottle should have been thrown out ages ago.

Last call: We visited mix on a Sunday evening and the place was a little dead. We were having a good time, enjoying the view and relaxing when the bartender told us it was last call. I looked at my watch: 11 PM. I couldn't believe it. What bar closes at 10 PM? In VEGAS no less. Just because you aren't making money hand over fist doesn't mean you toss what customers you do have out onto the street when they are having a good time and ordering drinks. Had they left us there to ourselves and continued to serve we would have ordered more. 

In summary: Last call at 11 PM? Bad port (You should know when to throw out your wines/ports when they are no longer good, if you can't tell, don't serve them), great atmosphere and amazing views of the strip.",lxhoW93Liu--hWiT0jPiwQ,0,0,2,1PHFJzwTsHwzj8Y8ZGe6KA

Chocolate Souffle - Pistachio Ice Cream
Warm Madeline - Warm Nutella

Unable to resist the allure of a three-foot-long Baba Au Rhum, no matter how full from a several course feast at Veranda, it was up the exterior facing glass elevator that myself and two friends ascended to Alain Ducasse's soon to reboot MiX and meeting two more at a ten-top table in the center of a cascade of glass bubbles it was in conversation and desserts that we partook, another double espresso over ice at half the price of the Four Seasons Lavazza proving a perfect accompaniment to the four-plate proceedings.

Truly one of the most stunning rooms in Las Vegas, with nearly panoramic reviews of the Strip and beyond, it was entry that we saw the object of our desire and admittedly having experienced the dessert several times in the past in locations from New York to London the tableside preparation was slightly less dramatic than that at the others while the choice of rum was a well-culled trio, myself opting for the lightest option while others veered spicy - all with stellar results over the apricot glazed cake with plenty of cream.

Deciding to also invest in a shared soufflé that proved an impeccable display of rich dark chocolate amidst an ethereal base that found much needed levity in a quenelle of pistachio ice cream, it was next in six sliced balls of crispy pate a choux surrounding smooth vanilla that we indulged and topping each one with thick chocolate fudge the third Ducasse classic was perhaps the best version of the dessert I've tasted to date - a compliment of questionably equal applicability to the hot-from-the-pan Madeline, a lightly crisp edge over delicate sponge that was delicious on its own and all the better when dipped in a sidecar of warm hazelnut spread.

Advertising, to some degree, that the whole three-foot baba would be served at a cost of $12 one rationally assumed that deal was too good to be true, and instead charging $12 per person for what would amount to perhaps a two inch slice the portion was still quite generous considering the version in London goes for about $26 per person - though with far more pomp and circumstance.  Truly a beautiful space it will be interesting to see where the Delano takes Ducasse and ""Rivea,"" but as long as they keep the signatures there is no doubt it is a space worth visiting, even if only for dessert with a view.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,4,z-Thii7syZ6nDJRJ1oZhgw

Mix is one of my favorite spots. It's at the top of The Hotel (at Mandalay Bay) and the strip views at night are the best (the same can be said about Foundation Room - also at Mandalay Bay)! Breath taking.

I've been here several times and I love that it is a mini club. It's not as loud or crowded. There are tables available for purchase (and there is a huge price per bottle per Vegas norm).

There is a fully stocked bars and very friendly bartenders. So friendly that if you get there early enough, the bartenders will treat you like royalty (drinks knocked off your bill and when the place gets busy, they come straight to you).

What is also awesome about this place is the bathrooms. I am not sure if this is true for the men's room as well, but the ladies have strip views. You can see out them, but not in them (think like police questioning rooms - as seen on TV). Taking a tinkle here is worth it.

The only thing that stinks about this place are the douchey security guards. You're a fucking rent a cop, calm down. They weren't rude to me, but they were rude to my friends because our group would sit too close to another groups table (the other tables didn't mind). I got ejected for calling him a rent-a-cop, whatever; jerk can't handle the truth. 

Mix Lounge is a wonderful, fun place to hang out with friends. Awesome views of the strip, a small, intimate place with a decent sized dance floor and beautiful people. I also like that the crowd her is a little older. None of that 21 year old prosti-tot drama.

First, the cocktails are terrible! I can barely find a true good cocktail in Vegas! I'm talking mixology cocktails...not pour liquor in a glass and add a mixer cocktail but ones with some thought and care. The wine list was good though so I'd recommend going in that direction.

We had a party of 8. Three of our meals went back. One of the meals was the $58 bison steak...it was colder than it was outside! Another meal was the sirloin. It was ordered butterflied and delivered as charred hockey pucks. The other meal (was mine) it was the barramundi fish. It was SO overdone I could barely cut it with a knife.

After we sent our meals back....while the rest of our party enjoyed their meals they came back in an enjoyable state. Although, I ended up changing my order to the curried lobster...read in other reviews and would definitely recommend that dish!

We sat outside. It was winter but they had heaters and the view was pretty. Ladies...watch your heels in the deck...they will slip down the cracks! I thought I was going to break a heel when mine got stuck!",YB9oFLaDAb3ZWyJ1h3Grwg,3,2,3,s2_qwKhStBdrd8irfUz4Ug

The place seemed emptier than usual, since everyone seemed to be going clubbing for the night (yeah, you ladies try and get into XS), but my table struck up a few awesome conversations with the randoms at the table next to us.  Definitely a surprise highlight of the night.

And check out that view!  Being at the top of Mandalay Bay, the club looks out on the strip.  There's even an outdoor area if you want to get a little closer to the edge.

The bread came with butter and homemade peanut butter. The waiter recommended the peanut butter with the walnut raisin muffin: good recommendation! It was fabulous! :)

For my entree, I ordered the scallops with pork and corn. The scallops and pork worked very well together. I was actually a little surprised! My fiance ordered the steak, it cut like butter. So yummy. I almost wished I had gotten the steak, but no, I was happy with my dish too. :)

The booths are super cute, Jetson-esk little domes (for lack of a better description.)  Random noise & conversation carries surprisingly well throughout the restaurant.  Well, just as our main courses are arriving we overhear our waiter, who couldn't possibly have been more unpleasant all night, talking smack about us because we are drinking regular water instead of paying for the premium water.

I have absolutely no idea how MIX ever received Michelin stars.  We didn't interact with a single member of the service staff that I can offer a single compliment.

I thought the ahi tartare was just okay. I would have preferred ahi and avocado instead of the cucumber with curry flavoring. 

The lobster curry was good but not amazing. The pieces of lobster were large, but the curry sauce and the rice were not too impressive.  Personally, I don't think the two go together.

The filet with foie gras and black truffle was yummy! Too bad my first steak was way overcooked.  They were nice enough to take it back and prepare another one for me, and they even gave me a new side of potatoes which I thought was a nice gesture.

I brought my team of Product Managers here for a nice dinner to top off a visit to Vegas for a conference. 

We started in the lounge, which has an exceptional view of last Vegas from the top of ""the hotel"" on the strip. 

The happy hour food was generally good, but not outstanding, and while the prices were decent, the portions were small. And thus we decided to move the the restaurant for dinner. 

This was a bit of a turning point in the night - while we are at the lounge, the service was exceptional and friendly. We felt very welcome.

When we moved over to the restaurant, a sudden air of snobbery hit us. The hostess did not seem at all happy to see us, and almost seemed hesitant to get us seated until we told her we had an open tab from the lounge and wanted to sit down for dinner - ""come back in 15 minutes"" she said coldly. 

We came back 18 minutes later and were promptly seated. We ordered several nice bottles of wine, and lots of appetizers, entrees and several desserts (we got two of the souffle because the first went nearly instantly). 

I had the lobster curry dish, which was absolutely delicious. 

Our waiter was much friendlier than our stuffy hostess, and was generally attentive. 

When the bill came, it was expectedly high, but not exorbitant - about $800 for the few of us.

I was surprised however with just one line item on the bill - $30 for 3 bottles of sparkling water. Apparently one of the folks at the table had asked for some, and it was given to the whole table, and they kept it flowing. 

Now $30 in the grand scheme of the bill is a drop in the bucket, but what really bothered me was how I was addressed when I asked about it:

""Did we really order $30 worth of water?"" The waiter stared at me coldly, and said almost condescendingly, ""yes."" No explanation, no apology, nothing - just stared at me as if I was crazy for asking. 

Gratuity was included, so I left an additional tip on the receipt: ""give a heads up for each new water bottle, especially at $10 a piece.""

What I really should have said was - ""don't act superior to your customers - you will crumble without them.""

Anyhow, I'm hoping it was just the couple of staff members I encountered, as the food was truly delicious, and the view from the lounge was incredible.

5527093,2010-12-26,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"For the restaurant, we came here for Christmas night, and we ended up getting a 5 course dinner for each of us, shall we begin?
Now we were concerned/apprehensive with ordering the menu that we did because it was so much food, however, the waiter ensured us that the dishes would be appetizer sized. (He was very nice, by the way) Oh my goodness, boy, we should've gone with our gut instinct.
Our dinner included...
Foie Gras (excuse my spelling): Buttered toast with Foie Gras and Pear Chutney and fleur de sal (salt) and peppercorns. Together, it was so delicious, the pear chutney was a little sweet on its own, however, in the mix it was delicious. The dish began to get a little salty towards, the end, so just ease up on the salt, and it was super rich and the liver was really rich, so delicious. My favorite dish!
Lobster Angel Hair: The angel hair was cooked perfectly, and the cream sauce was a little too rich, especially with the huge hunks of lobster it was served with.
Veal: So perfectly cooked, it was really tender, and just slightly pink. The sauce was really fatty and rich, and it was served with slow cooked pearl onions, baby lettuce, and mushrooms... I skipped out on them because I was so incredibly stuffed. (I actually ate the slow cooked baby lettuce, it was really flavorful but super mushy)
Eggnog: With nutmeg, and Grand Marnier. This was such a delicious creamy delight, however, the drink was supposed to be a palette cleanser....for freaking Santa Claus. This was another rich dish.
Lastlyy!! 
Bush de Noel: This wasn't your traditional one, this was a citrus themed one with vanilla bean ice cream, soaked sponge cake and orange sorbet. So delicious, but the cream exterior was wayy too sweet and sgary and the sorbet wasn't creamy, it was a little bitter.

 Long review for a delicious dinner, however the entire meal was terribly terribly rich, and I wish that it had a few palette cleansers and some more texture.
Let's just say I don't need to eat heavy food for a month after this...",FZshSTm1eJPcGSqf3eah6A,0,0,5,vxFcVPMQ0hKSf1LIjHOM5w
5541549,2010-09-08,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"""This is what Vegas is all about"" my fiance uttered as we walked into the Lounge area at Mix.

My review is for the Mix Lounge only.  It was about 8PM on Sunday night.  It was Labor Day weekend so we expected somewhat of a crowd.  Based on past yelp reviews I was eager to make it to Mix Lounge and didn't care what I had to do to get there.  Luckily, there was a huge wait at Burger Bar, so I was able to convince my fiance to stop in at Mix Lounge for a pre dinner drink.

Let me preface - we are NOT the clubbin types AT ALL.  Our preferences range from drinking beers at a local dive bar, to listening to top 40 at a swanky lounge sippin a cocktail or single malt scotch.  But the packed like sardines wall to wall club style where all the guys are dressed the same and the girls are looking for rich guys is NOT for us.  More along the lines of where Frank Sinatra would've smoked a cigar and sang to an intimate crowd.

The Mandalay Bay was super busy and we did see an overabundance of club shirts walking around.  I could tell there was some hesitation on my bf's face but I would not deterred.  I had read that the place doesn't really get crowded until after 10PM, and they don't charge cover until then either.  But even if you did want to visit Mix after 10PM, there are a ton of Mandalay Bay promoters handing out free cover and line passes throughout the hotel.  So avoiding cover doesn't seem to be a problem.

The experience to get to the Mix Lounge can be confusing I have to admit, yet exciting at the same time.  Mix Lounge and Restaurant is actually atop The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, and there is a cool red sign that makes it visible to the passerby.  We made the mistake of taking a right and heading towards the elevators to the actual hotel rooms (we weren't the only ones), as opposed to taking a left and heading to the express elevator to Mix.  Riding in the elevator was an experience in itself because it is literally on the 64th floor!

When we finally arrived, we walked through the gorgeous restaurant to get to the lounge.  The restaurant decor was soo beautiful - white furniture and flooring with white twinkle lights all around.  Dimly lit and something straight out of a movie.  Although we did not dine, and probably never will, it was an amazing sight.  We walked passed the kitchen and within a few steps - entered a dark room with awesome red chairs and lighting.  To the right - a huge bar.  To the left - the most amazing view of the Las Vegas strip, EVER.  We have stayed at the Signature at MGM Grand and stood on the balcony of our room.  We've stayed at the Palms Place and stood on the balcony of our room. But nothing comes close to the view at the Mix Lounge.  It truly is phenomenal - being located at the end of the strip allows you to see all of Las Vegas in front of you (Bellagio, Paris, the City Center).

It was basically empty at 8PM on a Sunday which is sad, but a plus for us since we aren't really into the crowds and the loud music.  And we don't like having to wait forever to get a drink.  We were greeted by super nice bartender who promptly brought us our beers (they do have Guinness and Sierra Nevada - and for $8 a beer we found that extremely reasonable, considering we had paid almost twice that at the House of Blues the night before)!  Unfortunately, we had a prior commitment off the strip and knew we had to drive - but if we hadn't - we would've gone for a stronger more potent cocktail.  They seemed to have a wonderful selection of alcohol, ranging from single malt scotches to a wide variety of vodka.

And then, we just took it all in.  Sitting at the bar, drinking our beverages, listening to laid back music, a view of the entire strip capturing our attention.  There were tables with booths in front of us - a very romantic setting. I could see ourselves sitting in a booth, just staring out at Vegas all night.  It was a surprisingly comfy feel for being a Vegas Lounge.  There is also a patio that you can walk onto to take a picture.  We took many.  In the very back of the lounge is a cool dance floor.  I am not sure how busy it gets busy later on - or how much the dance floor gets used - but it was a cool area.

After we finished our beverages, we reluctantly paid our tab and left. Again, our bartender was super nice and took our picture.  We then took the elevator we were supposed to use originally.  It's a non-stop express elevator that literally takes you through 64 floors in a matter of seconds.  It is located by the dance floor, and this allows you to avoid walking through the restaurant.  The elevator is all glass so on your way up, or down, you can see the strip all lit up and gorgeous as it should be.

All in all - we had an amazing experience at Mix Lounge. It was just what we were looking for - a breathtaking start to a Las Vegas night.",CK6w4REQliKRmBtJ-YArOA,7,2,5,4sPbuEto4ykwP86B64TX8g
5550121,2010-04-06,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"This is probably more of a 3.5 star dinner for me, and would have gotten four stars if I wasn't still hungry when I left Mix.  

So this was the restaurant my husband and I went to for a romantic dinner, and also to celebrate my passing my PMP exam a few weeks before.  We had restaurant.com certificates from here and Aureole, so I decided to give Mix a try, since my impression of Aureole that part of the experience of going there is to buy their really expensive wine to watch the wine angels grab it for you.  I didn't want to spend that much so Mix seemed like a better choice.

I know this is a Michelin star restaurant, but I wish I could have felt satisfied with just an entree at this place.  While some of the food was some of the best I have ever had, I just question the point of charging so much for so little, especially in a town hard-hit by a recession.  

Those of you that are a fan of this type of upscale food don't hate me, I want to be a foodie so bad but I just don't want to sell my house to pay for it.  I am an unemployed student, after all!

Now can you see the problem?

I fully understand the need for no nonsense door men/line cops in Las Vegas.  But when said door guy blatantly lies/makes up rules/is generally a pissy little gnat, it spreads a bad taste film over the entire experience.

5587960,2009-08-29,0,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"This is a 4 star restaurant that I'm tempted to give 3 stars.

1.  The waiter was WAY too pushy when it came to alcohol - every conversation was an excuse to recommend and push alcohol.
2.  My martini was not great and there was a ""surcharge"" for a premium alcohol I hadn't requested.
3.  My wife's gnocchi with morels and asparagus had NO MORELS.
4.  Service was WAY too fast - it's fine dining, not McDonald's.

So why 4 stars?  Well, the food was very good, the service was impeccable from everyone, even the waiter who pushed alcohol.  I don't know that this is as good as other Michelin star restaurants I've been to, but it certainly was good.

I had foie gras with rhubarb compote that was delicious and an excellent piece of veal.  My wife had the gnocchi, which despite the lack of morels, she loved, and lamb that were two big meaty lamb loin chops.  Her Chocolate souffle was OK, my Kirsch parfait was wonderful (though it was served like cherries on a meringue and wasn't really like a parfait.)  I loved the coffee and the waiter's assistant kept refilling it.

One other note: they knew it was our anniversary and there was no acknowledgement.  It's not mandatory that they do or say anything, but it's nice when they do it.  That's more of a comment - it doesn't factor into the review.",PyrplQ2sRhx9a555Dgn_wQ,1,0,4,h6KAd34y3c8wibeZHi0evg

The minute that I stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, I was taken back by the all white decorations. I love it! Absolutely sleek and chic. We were seated by the window. It's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. It was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.

They started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. Now, I'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! It was creamy with a hint of sweetness. I would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! It doesn't stop here, it gets better!

I ordered the filet mignon rossini w/ foie gras and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. Although I enjoyed the rib-eye, I believe the dish worth raving about is the filet mignon! It came with mashed potatoes. The filet was tender and juicy at the same time. The foie gras just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! I couldn't get enough. Prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. She recommended the Syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.

Our waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. I also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. The bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. I noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. When he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. So sweet of him! Aside from that, we also ordered the MIX candy bar which has coconut and lime sorbet. Totally worth it!!! The chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. Perfect combination.

After our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. Since Mandalay Bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. We were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. WHAT? Lame...

Food was wonderful, service was excellent (with one big exception explained later), but the whole reason we went to Mix, and paid their higher price on New Years Eve, was the view which was a HUGE disappointment.  I would not recommend Mix for New Years Eve.  Any other night I would say it is a great choice.

First the good.  The 5 course tasting meal was phenomenal.  We didn't just like all the courses, we loved them, and all were simply fantastic.  The opening veggie martin with truffle topping was one of the best appetizers I have tasted.  The wine pairing will also very nice, and our waiter was fantastic during the whole meal service.  It was also a very fun and festive atmosphere.

Now for the bad.  The whole reason we chose Mix, and paid the higher price, was to see the fireworks from their vantage point.  The problem was, we had no view at all.  The only people that had a view were the few tables that opted for outside seating.  The restaurants does NOT overlook the strip, and thus if you pressed your face to the window on one side, you could barely see two of the hotel fireworks.  The view is from the Mix Lounge, however that was closed, and restaurant patrons could not enter.  The other disappointing fact, was our waiter, who was so friendly and attentive, and throughout the whole meal, assured us just before the fireworks he would show us the good spot to stand.  The only problem was, after 11:30, he disappeared, and never reappeared.  There was no good spot, and this seemed in retrospect to have been just a con to get an increased tip.

Its almost like you're dining in a bottle of champagne- they have thousands of hollow glass balls suspended from strings hanging from the ceiling all over the restaurant.  The whole room is white- and there are HUGE windows that provide some spectacular views.  They also have these futuristic booths you can sit in called ""pods"", that are large white circular, capsule-type booths that provided for a really private and intimate dining experience.  

I'm going to have to disagree with a lot of reviews on Mix- the food IS worth the high price.  Don't come to a fine dining establishment in Vegas and bitch about the price- you simply should have known better.  Its not like they're serving bad food, people. 

 I chose the curried lobster dish- their signature.  It was extremely flavorful and delicious- not an overpowering curry taste at all.  The mac and cheese was OK...it was actually better at 3am that night once it had cooled down a bit.  When it was served fresh it was a little soupy.  My bf chose a filet, and he was happy with the quality of the steak and the temperature it was cooked to.  We also got a crab appetizer which was kind of boring.

1/27/11, My sister was turning 21 and ready to go to a club. I hadn't been to Mix, so we, along with two friends, decided to go there. Fast forward to 11 PM.

Watch your step, the elevator is not flush with the floor, so be cautioned so you don't end up stubbing your toe then propelling into the elevator. 

Up, up, up we went. A bunch of guys from Kitchener, probably in their mid to late 30's were chatting. I said, ""So you guys from Ontario?"" They said yes and asked if I was as well, especially since I knew about Kitchener. Nope. I just know famous cities.

After getting out of the elevator... crickets... and old people. I'm talking a table of 80-somethings on the balcony. WHAT WAS THIS? A small round dance floor in the corner with not a single soul gracing it. A long row of tables. A KITCHEN? What else? Oh yeah, Warren G. was blasting.  We stayed maybe 15-20 minutes.

The music was great, the view was great, but the crowd was a bust. I had no idea this place was a restaurant. It's very misleading that they advertise this as a dance club - it's not. The music was so good that it got 2 stars and an extra star for the view.

*Sommalier on site to help choose between the exorbitantly-priced, but excellent wines on the endless list.

*The service was not up to the pricetag of the menu or its Michelin rating. We were fortunate enough to have a very sweet guy who didn't ever leave us hanging (and didn't laugh when we needed to start dinner with sugarfree redbull and vodka!), but I would expect Michael Mina-level flawless service here.
*The food was 5 stars--when you get to decide between bison and venison on a menu (I chose the perfectly-prepared bison fillet), you are in for a unique dining experience. The creamed spinach on the side was notably good. And we also shared the surf and turf: striped bass, seared foie gras, brussel sprouts, with crushed black truffle. And you should order the baba au rhum dessert just for fun--the moist cake is already steeped in rum, and you get extra, warm rum to pour on top--deee-lightful.

Of course the service was spot on but that is to be expected at a place of this caliber.

5736789,2012-04-02,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"I have dined at Mix many times with a friend of mine and loved it, so we suggested it for our mutual friend's birthday extravaganza. The evening did not start out as intended. First, you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the hostess podium, why they hide it is beyond me as it makes perfect sense to have it out front and visible. After we checked in, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. Every other diner in the restaurant was seated with a view of the strip so we thought that was a little odd. Sure, we are young, but we were going to spend plenty of money considering the price of the entrees! So we asked to be reseated, since it was my friend's birthday we were hoping for a seat with a view, I mean that is the allure of Mix. We were immediately seated in a corner in front of the hostess podium, with a view of the Southwest, ummm OK? So we asked if we could sit outside instead. The hostess begrudgingly lead us outside and sat us in the far corner of the balcony, with a beautiful view of the airport. This seemed very passive aggressive to me and that belief was validated as she whispered into our waiters ear for a good few minutes, not even trying to hide the fact that she was clearly talking about us. We seriously almost got up and left, as there are plenty of other fabulous dining options in Mandalay Bay. Now, I agree that we may have been a pain, but the restaurant was nearly empty and there were plenty of tables open on the balcony the entire time we dined, so it was not like the place was packed and we were demanding a specific seat. Also, the strip celebrated Earth hour, so it was really cool to see all the lights go out on the strip, of course we had to stand and peer over the railing since we were still in a corner, but we definitely enjoyed the view. Overall, this was really a sour start to what was supposed to be a fun evening.

The food at Mix never disappoints and it shouldn't for the price. You always start out with a selection of fresh baked breads, so many delicious choices it's hard not to fill up. I always get the braised Wagyu beef and I am always happy with it. It is served in a cute little pot with a delicious braising sauce, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions. It is fork tender and a nice size for the price. I shared a bite with everyone and they were all very jealous! I also tried a bite of my husband's ribeye and my friend's venison, which were both delicious. We always get a side of mac and cheese with ham, which is always a creamy and delicious winner. We tried the fries as well, they had a weird seasoning on them, but worked when I dipped them in the Wagyu gravy. They also serve a complimentary Madeleine pastry at the end of the meal, which is lemony and delicious. I definitely appreciated that they brought them out with a happy birthday plate and a side of Nutella for our friend, it was the least they could do after how we were initially treated. 

Overall, I love Mix, but will think twice after this debacle. They have a fabulous view and fantastic food, but nobody likes a pretentious and unfriendly start to their meal. Our evening would have been 100% better if it had started with a smile and a warm greeting, nobody likes to feel like a pain, change the attitude Mix and you will have a packed house every night. It seriously pains me to give you 3 stars since I truly believe that the food is 4 star, but I can't ignore how we were treated.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,1,0,3,77i221t9ZXOTSOOh-DdKEw

It would be our only Michelin restaurant  on this trip and I wanted to visit the Mix lounge next door.  We had an early reservation in order to make it to Le Reve, so there was almost no one in the restaurant, and there was still sunlight.   The restaurant seems to face east and west, so there was really no direct view of the strip, so the view was a little overstated.  The room was marvelous, with the thousand bubble chandelier--glass balls handblown in Italy and imported to Mix.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  We always had our water and iced tea refilled with smiles.  They served us a French butter and a chocolate butter, which paired wonderfully with the walnut bread provided.

We started with the spicy tuna salad, which was really a tuna tartare and the sea bream sashimi.  The sashimi had a popcorn garnish to add an interesting texture, and it was fresh, but we weren't wowed by it.  The tuna tartare though was delicious--you could smell its freshness as it was placed on our table, and we enjoyed every morsel of this dish!  For entrees, we had the tenderloin and the surf N turf, which was stuffed chicken with a small piece of lobster.  My lovely wife gobbled up the delicious lobster and had a little harder time with the chicken, which I eventually finished.  The tenderloin was small, but tender and flavorful and was one of the best steaks I've had--better than Morton's, but not as good as Jiraffe's.  For dessert, we had their signature ""candy bar"", which is kind of a combination of a cake bar with a crunchy waffle-like bottom--very good--and the decaf coffee had that nice ""cigarette"" taste to it.  

Afterwards, we walked over to the empty lounge and marveled at the view there.  It had a Northern exposure and you could see the Las Vegas Strip in all its gaudy magnificence.

The lobster curry sounds crazy but it's fantastic (we ordered one with our entrees, for everyone to share!), and the wagyu beef stew is soooo good - I don't know why they bother giving you a knife, it falls apart. They also do this crazy dessert cocktail that has this foam on top - it's like a passionfruit/peach type thing. So amazing.

The first time I came here was with my cousin and my brother for his 21st birthday (I was the older bro sponsoring the trip) and I walk into this elevator only to have our entire party confused.  There were a series of plaques, and the three of us plus the other people in the elevator were all scratching our heads as to what to do.  Then I thought, hmm, I wonder if that plaque is some Indiana-Jones-Business where you push it in to get to the secret room.  YUP.

Haven't tried the food or done anything in the Chandelier room, but stritcly speaking for the lounge area they hit the nail on the head.  Bartenders were friendly and provided prompt service, although drink prices were still very vegas-esque, as in the tune of $10-20 a drink.  The second time I came here I ordered 3 jameson shots and it was $34.  Yikes.

The outdoor area was a great experience.  We sat laid back on comfortable couches sipping our champagne while having a nice social time and taking in the incredible view.  What more could you ask for when you're in Vegas.  And the best part is this place is always advertised as the pre-party, but you can get lost spending hours there.

We probably exchanged eye rolls and looks with everyone on that side of the restaurant that night!

Colorado Lamb Loin.  Pomme Anna, stuffed piquillo pepper and herb salad.   Lamb was cooked just at that edge of rare and medium rare and achieves my top marks.

Roasted Maine Lobster au Curry with basmati rice.    Lobster was perfectly cooked.   Zesty sauce 

Strawberry rhubarb was so different.  I have never had rhubarb by itself,  but it was so tart and delicious.

5800942,2011-01-28,1,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"Fortunately, a fabulous view and gorgeous decor can save Mix from what would have otherwise been a 3 star review. I had my bachelorette dinner here, and had talked to the banqueting manager to arrange a private room for a party of 18. However, when we arrived, we were a little disappointed that we weren't in any kind of private section, but instead, smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. Also, instead of having all of us sit at one table, they arranged it so that we had to be divided into three tables, which was kind of a bummer and a little awkward for some of my guests. We all ordered off a set menu which came with: chilled zucchini soup with fresh ricotta and basil, either the free range chicken with wild mushrooms or the slow cooked salmon served with apple mustard, jasmine rice, and seasonal vegetables, and the Mix candy bar which was basically a chocolate wafer dessert. Sadly, the dessert was the only redeeming course of the entire meal for me as I could barely touch my soup and salmon. First of all, what is with Vegas and cold soup? I guess it's because of the scorching hot weather out there, but still, I do not need to drink cold soup when I'm inside a perfectly air-conditioned room. Then after my brother made the comment ""this soup reminds me of 2 girls 1 cup"", it was definitely game over for everyone at our table. Also, from what I heard from my friends, the chicken was a little better than the salmon, but unfortunately, I ordered the salmon and had one bite and was so turned off from the overbearing mustard sauce that was poured all over my dish... I know, this is a lot of hating for a 4-star review, but honestly, I'm sure if we weren't limited to the prix fixe menu, the food would have been a lot better because the ala carte items on their menu sound amazing. Would definitely come back to try this place again with a smaller party and hopefully the food won't disappoint me again...",BQieyj8zZiTBquq6DnaWCA,1,0,4,AsV46YfJXLQqHwZAQvXtDw

We had a reservation for 9:45pm, and our waiter had to apologize that the prix fixe wasn't available after 9:30. What he didn't say was that (we presume) the chef had gone home 15 minutes earlier, and left it to the late-night catering team to ladle-out whatever had been mass-produced earlier that day.

My girlfriend and I ordered the tuna tartare to start with, which came with taro chips and a small dollop of mango sauce on the side. Pretty plain. She followed it up with chicken (bland), while my entree was a filet of bison. I had to scrape a thick blanket of peppercorns from the top of the meat to have any hope of tasting its real flavor, while the vegetables (for which the waiter could barely contain his excitement) could only fairly be described as 'vegetables'. Quite what he saw in them, I have no idea. My girlfriend's comment that it all seemed like 'wedding banquet food' hit the nail right on the head. If these were $14 entrees I wouldn't have felt cheated. But these were not $14 entrees.

We cut our losses and skipped dessert.

The odd cocoon we were seated in prevented any views of the strip, and, oddly, had the effect of focusing sound such that it sometimes felt like diners at tables across from us were speaking right in our ears. I guess it made a distraction from the pounding of the nightclub next door.

Service was perfectly fine. But to charge these kinds of prices for that kind of food is cynical and shameful. I can't imagine I'll be trying another Alain Ducasse restaurant.",88aUbmt2Ib2R5ep4yvCoJg,4,0,1,-vkSeH0Z4IlD5Jpi4W8_-g

On one hand you have the food and the service and on the other hand you have the ambiance.  Lets start with the food and the service.  We were promptly greeted at the podium and taken to a booth (more on this later).  The server was prompt and professional.  We order a bottle of wine and a cocktail and both were served without delay.  The bread basket was fresh and of very high quality.  Two butters were served but the peanut flavored butter really was just average.  We ordered appetizers.  My wife ordered beet salad and I had a mixed meat plate.  EXCELLENT!!!!  Both in preparation and taste.  For dinner I ordered the Cod and my wife ordered the Tuna Tartare.  EXCELLENT!!!!  Service was GREAT.  The food was OUTSTANDING.  The entire staff had a positive and great attitude.  However, now we come to the ambiance.  Why on earth would a restaurant on the 64th floor of the Delano have booths that FACE INWARD???????  Please check Alize.. Please check Capitol Grille!  The booth is small and cramped.  The room is white and the red water glasses with napkins folded and standing on the table make it look like a mid western wedding.  There is a stairway in the middle to nowhere....  Strange decor and strange layout.   We understand that they will be remodeling.  When the remodel is complete we will definitely go again but until then we will pass.

Bartenders were not busy but still took FOREVER to get to us, we stood there almost 10 minutes waiting and all 3 of them looked right at us and kept horsing around with each other and patrons. Excusable I suppose if it was the only negative aspect, but there's more to this 3-star review than just that.

View is beautiful, but it was too cold to go outside so we stayed inside and settled for having our view partially (and at times fully) obstructed by various types of human beings (old, young, skinhead, whoreish, hipster, ghetto, etc..) acting like teenage monkeys. Which reminds me, the dance floor is awful. Lots of flailing, bouncing, slipping and grinding sloppily (stay in your own space please!). Music is mostly top 40 mixes with a few bass-heavy bump 'n grind songs mixed in. 

Just my opinion, but as a lounge with such a spectacular view, it would improve the atmosphere quality and ambiance greatly if they would play gentler music more suited to the view and the decor. 

Meh. Lately I've found myself really bored, even slightly annoyed, with the club scene. Everything is the same, and so mediocre.

I've been waiting for a few days to write this review, so I could synthesize just how disappointing this meal was.

My company Christmas party was in Las Vegas this year.  My bosses are both big foodies and they'd been to Ducasse's restaurants before (in fact, one of my bosses had been to his two other Michelin star restaurants in Europe, so we had high hopes).  I cannot believe how shitty this place was.  Yes, I said shitty.

First, we had made a reservation to sit at the chef's table.  There were 18 of us and we wanted to make sure that we could all sit together at one large table.  They split us up in groups of 9 (which is ridiculous, as we all had plus ones) and threw us into the main dining room.  When my boss took issue with this new seating arrangement with the hostess, she curtly replied ""well that's not my problem, sir.""  If you're the hostess and your customer's pre-arranged seating gets mixed up, it is, in fact, your problem.  We decided not to talk to the manager about this because we didn't want people spitting in our food.

So we waited 20 minutes to have our initial drink orders taken.  Then 15 minutes later we got some bread.  During this whole waiting period our water was refilled to the very top of the glass at almost a comedic pace.  I know that's nitpicky, bu tit was rather hilarious in the moment.  We did the prix fixe menu, which you would think would be easy to keep track of, but I was brought the wrong dish for both courses.  The service mixed up our two tables consistently.  I had to stop the person delivering my entree and say ""I did not order this. Try the other table.""  I was correct and someone at the other table ordered the fish. 

My steak was fine, but the menu did not say it was a petite filet, and yet there it was.  I mean, it was good, but I was expecting a full filet, as that's how it was labeled on the menu.

Dessert was lovely, but the service was so horrible.  Our bill was over $3K for our entire table and it was some of the worst service I've ever encountered.  Sure, the restaurant looks nice and the view from the lounge is great (even though the Foundation Room at the Mandalay Bay has a better view and is basically attached to THE Hotel).  Just avoid this place.  Fluer is downstairs and from what I understand it is WAY better.",7CWTRDLpUvYzZWzR3sdTJQ,4,0,2,iorjTSCUopVvx-osXTZj8g
5991940,2011-11-18,2,Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA,"One of the best meals I've had this year was at MIX. No, we didn't get the ""spectacular view"" table. We got the partial ""spectacular view"" table. We got the view of the Rio and Palms. I thought our meals were going to be decent with the help of the view, it would be amazing. Apparently, the view didn't even count towards this review because our meals were AMAZING (yes with capital letters).

I like how they brought us the bread basket and instead of just butter, they brought us Peanut Butter & regular butter. Bread was delicious and the peanut butter was really good. It tasted fresh and not too sweet. We told our server, we were going to use our restaurant.com certificate. Our server was kick ass. He was very gracious and very upbeat. The fact that we had a certificate with us didn't change the quality of his service. 

I had the Halibut with Bok Choy, Jesse had the Duck dish. Again, for this dinner we shared a bowl of Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I was in the mashed potatoes kick during our trip. My Halibut dish was beautiful. The taste was clean, fresh, and the sauce was perfect. Jesse loved his dish too. However, the star of our meals was the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I ate most of it and felt bad (guilty feeling) afterwards.

Service was excellent. Our server was very chatty, but not in the annoying way. He asked our opinions about our meals. At the end, he gave us complimentary Madeleine cookies with Chocolate dipping sauce. I thought that was really sweet of him. 

I will highly recommend MIX for all of you. With our without discount certificate, this place is worth a try. At least once.",wkrFqNxwTEEkG3mJV88Izw,5,3,5,foj0CBLJ-p3Q70gGtOcd1w

My waiter and other staff had trouble understanding simple questions. We had to ask twice for the drinks. I read that the Pomegranate Martini was fabulous. It was not all that great. The Apple Martini was blah too. My friend had to wave down a waiter to wave down our waiter with no success. We finally waved down our waiter and placed the appetizer and entree order in one shot. I tried the Seared Duck Fois Gras with Lentils, Beef Tenderloin  with Sauce Au Poivre, and Pressed Chicken Fois Gras with leeks and truffles. The chicken was the only redeemable dish.  The food was not presented ""four star and four diamond style"". Basically, the food was mediocre except the chicken pate. Even the two desserts were boring and lackluster pastries. I've tasted way better pastries at small pastry shops like JPM at Bellagio. Please don't waste your money here. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay the $200 - $300 check. For the price this restaurant is a definate don't. The view by the window was cool though and the decor was superb. Le Cirque is a better choice if you want to experience French American. This place disappointed. I wanted to give a nice review. Again, the staff of Mix, is a mess. I hope that was just a bad night for them.",nyrKpx9xOwEcCi_fLO3kVw,1,0,2,IvBJEJ6zCliB9fjnYZ9YHg
