I love her chocolate ganache tarts, smores pie, monkey bread, fudge, and basically everything else. Highly recommend her stand! She offers oil free, gluten free, and nut free scrumptious options! You will not regret it!",RCEpc5ukh-y9Xa4tAnugFA,2,1,5,Nuu7x3Qi4XScxV6uiSdmeg

I would definitely recommend Bite Vegan Bakery to everyone, and I plan on coming here more often.",hUCUH1bb76ptNtp8rgQAIQ,1,0,5,MRuxSB1J0wID5kHA2k1eSQ

1040372,2013-12-08,1,GWm6Da7qib16APWNXcvmSw,"So, I was with my fiance visiting family in Vegas, and we had a mix of Vegan and non-Vegan people to feed. It can be difficult to find something that satisfies both but Bite def did the trick. 

Personally, I thought the food was way better than many versions I've had with dairy/eggs, etc. Pretty shocking actually! Highly recommend the monkey bread and caramels.

The Vegan eaters in the group found a new favorite place and they go to the market to stock up on the Bite goodies on a weekly basis now.",g_h4lRtmkNGWVDY0VVDRGg,2,2,5,lKewhvW3rBNMzf4Pv75psw

Not sure what to say about this other than these desserts are one of the best vegan options in this city.

Sure you can find heavy sugary vegan cakes and cookies all over the place. (come on it's just minus the egg and dairy). But her items are yum yum yummy!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,5,6,5,6Uwfs41cRtx7X-z7SkHQzA
1444353,2015-06-04,0,GWm6Da7qib16APWNXcvmSw,"This is probably the BEST vegan bakery in Vegas and definitely worth the wait for Saturdays in Tivoli! Make sure you get here early though, because a lot of stuff sells out FAST and no wonder..it's beyond good.

We go here almost every Saturday and have gotten a few different sweets from here but by far my favourite is the chocolate cake. Wow. So light and creamy, and very rich with chocolate and the icing is to die for. If you need a chocolate fix, look no further than this cake and if you need a sweet fix, look no further than this place.

Make sure you find yourself here sometime. Even if you aren't vegan, there is no way you wouldn't enjoy everything here. The people who work here are also pretty awesome and attentive and they give you a taste of anything you want. (: Enjoy!",dAkm7-iv8HiePcrfLa3MBw,0,2,5,WgGMro773J-XGGeaPsYwfA

Bite has a great selection of goods and many are gluten free. Total brownie points! I fell in love with the chocolate raspberry cake and I've been coming back for it. I had her waffles a few weeks back and it's still one of the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest waffle I've ever had!",EfxEihZlX44-awpPSThrGA,3,2,5,mon1bPPrWsvCNxV4OPLkAQ
5123817,2015-05-13,4,GWm6Da7qib16APWNXcvmSw,"Celiac disease sufferers, BEWARE!!! These people cross contaminated a gluten free waffle my wife and I ordered. 

We went to the farmers market at Tivoli Village on May 9th, 2015. We stumbled upon this stand and the menu looked interesting. I did not even think of this until after I began to feel sick, they were offering standard waffles and gluten free waffles yet only had 1 waffle maker???! Tell me, how do you avoid cross contamination when you're cooking both waffles in the same waffle maker!!!!! You can't call your gluten free waffles gluten free. It is now Tuesday the 12th of May and she is still not feeling well! 

Lucky for us, we have a gluten intolerance. What if a person with celiac disease had eaten this, you would've killed them! You need to learn about cross contamination prior to selling any food products which makes me wonder if SNHD has ever visited you. Maybe it's time to give them a call.",AQ0NRRasg_FA403S5gKEDA,4,0,1,nhO0STYXORAVMulMrQoW2g
