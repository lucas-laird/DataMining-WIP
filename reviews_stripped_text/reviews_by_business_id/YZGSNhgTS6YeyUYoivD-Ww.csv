45296,2015-02-19,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,We originally selected this restaurant because we saw a billboard advertising sushi. When we arrived it was a straight up brewpub. They have sushi but after looking around at what the other customers were ordering I decided to go with the fish and chips. I was very happy with my choice. The fried fish was battered nicely and was flakey. The sushi at the tables around us looked clean and well presented. Triple 7 would be a good choice for a group who couldn't decide between traditional bar food or sushi. You can have both!,B4TLdQjzeCYn6ZbJAjb3hg,0,0,4,a4Eqks6ui7CgZWQflKT89A

Main St. can always be depended on for the best pale ale in town.  Only 2 bucks each during happy hour or after midnight!  They also have great pub snacks... like garlic fries, wild mushroom pizza, veggie (or regular) burgers and a full sushi bar.  The only drawback is the TVs, which are constantly tuned to either World Series of Poker or Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Also the ""brewmaster special"" beer selections have been known to be pretty weird & unappetizing... like Raspberry Creme Ale.  Sounds like sweet chick beer to me... gimme real beer!  But as long as the very hoppy Pale Ale is available this is not a real problem!  This place can also get very crowded on Friday/Saturday nights, and so occasionally feels like some sort of feeding lot.",2WniIUDY7MqU1rNL1nwolQ,0,0,4,UvzRjhW6MPYRErxhMrW6Wg

NY Steak was okay. The price was good for a steak dinner.  Baked potatoe it came with was not so good.

Won Ton Min was good.  The broth was really good for a non-Chinese Restaurant and the portion was large.  They put eggs, fish cake, char siu and won tons with the noodles.  Really good after you win 200 coins from the wheel of fortune slot machine.

Chicken Wings were really good.  I thought for sure they would suck.  They were tender and not dry in the inside.  Taste was good.  Just enough heat to make you sniffle.

Beer was cheap.  Drank many different types for cheap so definately a fan here.

Service was okay.  A little slow, but bearable since we could watch TV while we waited.

428603,2011-11-29,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"""...Save Water (and the food), Drink Beer.""

The food is average - a bit above average, come for the beer.

As of Thanksgiving weekend 2011, they had a sampler for $5.50 - five 5 ounce sampler sized glasses of each of their current selections, an IPA, Porter, Blond, Hef, Red, and one of their seasonals - which I fancy the Pumpkin Spice... or get all of them each in a nice full pint for only $1.75 (Seasonal only available in the restaurant)...

...and remember you're in Vegas, so you actually might want to stop in for a quick bite, and  stop by the bar next to the buffet for the beers, but try your hand at the Video Poker machines to get the beers free (albeit your $ in the cup for tip).

For the REAL beer drinker, you'll appreciate these micro brewery's take on these standards. The IPA for example, being the more hoppy of the types is actually pretty subtle, and finishes smooth - which you'l find is a trend with all the selections you choose. My favorie is the Black Chip - which resembles the most like that of a Porter, smooth and rich from the first touch of your lips to the last drop, again, clean finish.

4 Stars are for the beer, the restaurant gets 3 stars. As the slogan they stole from Cancun... Save Water (and the food), Drink Beer.",VxX4pYXAmwACzdkuDcxVbQ,1,0,4,8kQr30zqeIx22uJ2muXxsQ

This place is a brewery and the beer was very good. It was happy hour and the 23 ounce beer was only $3. Can't beat that. We ordered from the happy hour menu and got the pretzels with cheese sauce. Very standard but satisfying. We also ordered the BBQ sliders which were good but not enough meat inside I would say. We also got the nachos from the happy hours which, for what they cost, were huge! That's probably the best thing on the happy hour menu as far as what we sampled.

I'm dinging this place one star because we sat at the bar because the hostess told us it was OK but someone had reserved the bar so she told us to sit down near one end, which we did. But the bartender hadn't arrived yet. We waited about 10 minutes and when the bartender showed up, he moved us. That was weird because it was supposed to be a party of six that had the bar reserved and we left enough seats. But whatever. The bartender was kind of short with us. So we left and then decided to come back and try to get a table. Which we did, even though it was busy. The waitress was good but our food took some time to get to us. Anyway, this is getting long so here's the breakdown:

1. Happy hour prices: 5 out of 5.
2. Beer selection and flavor: 5 out of 5.

Whats unique about this place is that they have great burgers, YET they have a personal sushi chef making sushi till 12am! Now that is amazing!! I loved the unagi sushi that I ordered. The chef even shaped my wasabi into a leaf!

Given a very small per diem, I was looking for a nice steak dinner without the strip prices. My fellow Yelpers recommended the 777 Brewery, and I'm glad they did!

We started with drinks, a Black Chip Porter and Sis had a mojito. Both were tasty. The porter was a bit mild, but had a light, smooth, nutty taste. Sis said her mojito was very good. Next, we had the pot sticker app and it was awesome, one of the best I've had. I then had a ""side salad"" that was the size of a meal, so we split that. Finally, our 16 oz rib eyes came out. They were delicious! Sis had a perfect rare and mine was a perfect med rare. Baked potato was awesome, the side veg was the only meh part of the meal. I was so full, it didn't matter. My only disappointment was I couldn't take my leftovers home.

Our total bill was $56!

After dinner, we walked the two blocks back to Fremont Street for more fun. Oh, and the casino was fun too!

Hubby ordered the pepperoni pizza, which was just as tasty as the cheese bread but with pepperoni on top. I ordered their 1/2 lb prime rib, which was cooked to perfection. The 1/2 lb prime rib is a steal! For only about $8.99, you get the 1/2 lb prime rib, vegetables and a choice of a baked potato, rice or fries. I opted for the baked potato.

It had become a staple on our annual Vegas excursions, thanks to its casual atmosphere, friendly service, and good food for the price.  Unfortunately, our latest experience left a lot to be desired.

The food was a mixed review.  I thought the smothered potato chips were awesome (even though my bf didn't care for the white cheese sauce on them).  I can't believe that the Angus sliders were actually Angus -- they tasted like the meat from my grade school cafeteria, kind of spongy and weird.  Plus, it was odd that they only gave us toppings for two burgers (two pickle slices, two tomato slices, etc.) when there were three burgers.  The cup of chili was so tiny that we thought they brought us corn chips and dip by mistake, but to their credit, the chili was very tasty.  (We'd had the bowl of chili before -- it's a much better value for only a couple bucks more.)  The entrees tasted great and were plentiful servings, but my only gripe was that the ahi salad only had one small piece of avocado in the whole thing.

The main problem was the service.  We were seated promptly, but our server was obviously overwhelmed.  She was apologetic at first, and having worked in food service, I am generally sympathetic, but at points, our server was nowhere to be found.  Drinks came 15 minutes after our appetizers.  Tables around us turned over twice by the time it took to get our entrees.  We requested to-go containers at the time we got our entrees, having waited so long that we'd lost our appetites, and we waited another 15 minutes before I walked over to another server's station and asked for some.  I ended up walking up to someone who I think was the manager (who was dealing with another customer who had waited endlessly to order) to get the check.  Just inexcusably slow -- about 1.5 hours for just appetizers and entrees when we already knew what we wanted to order.

I've had much better experiences here before, so I hope the most recent one was just the exception and not a trend.  I'd still give Triple 7 another shot the next time I'm in Vegas.",txmEEfiChF8pMP56Vtv5aQ,0,0,3,26Krg4eCMtK5a2C2AdH5NQ

1330360,2014-10-11,1,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"I've wanted to try this place for a while but never got over here on my last couple trips to Vegas. Well, I finally made it and I wasn't disappointed. This place has a large, open, airy atmosphere with glassed in areas so you can see the brewery. Their prices are much better than the typical gouging you get on the strip.

The Good:
I loved their sirloin and black bean chili. The meat was tender, flavorful, and a refreshing change from the typical ground beef you find in chili. I like chili and this is one of the better versions of this dish I've had.
   The Grilled Orange Roughy was nicely seasoned, without detracting from the flavor of the fish. The portion was good if not overly generous.
   I'm a bit of a cheesecake snob so I wasn't sure about trying their deep fried cheesecake. Fortunately I decided to give it a shot. This was surprisingly good! They take a slice and cover it with a sugar tempura batter, then fry it. I suspect the cheesecake is either frozen or partially frozen before they fry it since the center was VERY cold, although not quite frozen. The crust is crisp and crunchy, giving the cheesecake a very different texture than I'm accustomed to. The flavor of the cheesecake itself was very good too, rich, smooth, and creamy.
   I also tired the beer sampler which was a great way to try all the micro brews they had available. You get 5 5oz glasses for $6. All the beers were solid offerings, good and nicely balanced flavors. Despite this, there were no unique standouts that made me sit up and say wow. If you like your IPA's SUPER hoppy you'll be disappointed. Instead they went for a more tempered, balanced approach, which I certainly appreciated since I'm not an IPA fan.

The Bad:
One of the sides I got with the orange roughy was rice and that's all it was, just white rice. They made no attempt to season it or do anything to it, just a pile of white rice. With all the other flavors going on everywhere else I thought this was a glaring omission. It was also something I didn't order, but I'll get to that next.

The Indifferent:
The service was pretty good overall. Most of the time my waitress checked back regularly but there were a couple times where she seemed to disappear for a while (and they weren't particularly busy). The main reason I'm putting the service here is because she got my order wrong. The fish was supposed to come with the vegetable of the day and choice of potato. I chose mashed potato and got plain white rice. If the overall service had been just a little poorer I would have put it in the bad instead of indifferent.",maeTOPoDpldg7ltkDmOVaA,1,2,4,SJEHol-LyINlhx9KRmdpVg

The Meatball Sliders are amazing. 3 sliders on a warm bun, smothered in a rich and tangy sauce and dripping with melted cheesy goodness. The fries are crispy and salty the way a fry should be. The wings are awesome. I prefer them extra well done. Nothing worse then biting a wing and the damn thing is bloody. We been there so many times, i can go on and on about the food. The beer is incredible. They take time and pride in their batches. Barleys Beer is ok but pales in consideration. Chicago Brewing company comes in 2nd to Triple 7 Brew. They have their signature beers and tend to add 1-3 new flavors monthly-Bi Monthly. The Black Cherry Cream is awesome. You can taste the Cherry and so smooth.

1467015,2016-04-08,2,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"One of many restaurants that does honor the Boyd's travel meal coupon.

This restaurant is located in the Main Street Hotel, we have been to Main Street countless times, usually travel with my mother in law, and she doesn't care for the ""bar"" type of environment so we could never eat here having her with us.  This particular travel, it was just me and my mister, so we were excited to give this place a try finally.

We visited the restaurant everyday during our stay at a near-by hotel.  Items we ordered during our many visits included, sushi, cheese burger w/blue cheese, chicken wings, a creamy chicken pasta dish, garlic bread, pepperoni pizza, strawberry short cake, and the main reason for our repeat visit is the root beer float!  

My mister and I did not like any of the foods, none of it! the creamy chicken pasta looked good, but it was sooo bland!, I gagged after my third scoop.  The pasta noodles was way over cooked, the sauce tasted like thick cream with no taste, hardly any chicken but they did give a lot which I wasted 90% of.   I've had better frozen pepperoni pizza and didn't care to the leftovers with us. The strawberry shortcake was huge, how can you go wrong with a ssc? Well, sadly, we didn't care for this either.  The cake portion tasted kind of weird, almost like a corn bread texture and look, but a bit sweeter.  I can't recall if the strawberry's were fresh or frozen?  Hardly ate any of it.   My mister ordered the sushi, and had a bad craving for sushi, ate a couple, and said he tasted better from Costco, pre-made sushi, sitting in the refrigerator.   Good thing we were using our meal coupons, so it didn't bother me too much.   BUT!!!, let me tell you! The ROOT BEER FLOAT, is the best I have ever tasted.  The vanilla ice cream is served in a chilled frosty tall mug, and the Henry Weinhard root beer is left in the bottle.  One serving of this delicious RBF is enough for both of us.  This is usually the only item that we have to pay for.  So refreshing, and satisfying, even on a cold winter night haha.",Ad8lg8eD5VseGw5o-xaJCw,3,2,4,GZOJD3o5xP7pzYnL9ECwgw

A Beef Patty is Charbroiled and then mated with Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Lettuce, a house sauce and toasted Sourdough.

Well it is good but it is no CC.  They shouldn't even be in the same category (American traditional).  But the truth is, it is way better than most places I have been to in Vegas.  The Nachos were crazy yummy and paired perfectly with their Pale Ale.  I'm a bit of a microbrew snob but their Pale Ale was very flavorful and hearty.  It is inside Main St Casino which is not a bad place although I decided to drive over to the Nugget from there instead of walk even though it was just about 3 blocks.  

The food is above average.  The service slightly above average but for some reason they were very slow on bringing me the check.  In their defense, they were getting busier really quickly.

My sister-in-law ordered buffalo wings and an italian sausage pizza.  My sister-in-law's cousin ordered the philly cheesesteak.  

Little by little, the food came out and I was surprised at how big the portions were.  I truly didn't expect it from the prices whatsoever.  It was to the point where we contemplated on switching to a bigger table to have more space for all the plates.  The service was okay, though our server wasn't anywhere to be found when we needed her, but she was nice.  

The crab & artichoke dip was great.  I didn't really taste the crab but it was super cheesy and it came with chips and garlic bread.  The buffalo wings were decent.  The italian sausage pizza was pretty decent also.  I love that they don't skimp on the cheese, whether it be on the nachos, my dip, or the pizza!  The teriyaki burger was nothing special.  I told the waitress I wanted it medium well but it seemed like I got it well done because it was dry.  

Overall, this is a great place to hit up for appetizers and beer.  Cheap eats and great atmosphere.",dihqE_A2F0lge_zP1fqcxg,1,0,3,3R9ztT_kTbZ1QZsTiBrCBQ

1841670,2010-05-02,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"If it were all about Happy Hour, Triple 7 gets Four stars, but it's not always happy hour. The Happy Hour menu includes some appetizer like dishes and some sushi. Sushi and beer during happy hour does justice to the term here. 

For the regular menu, they charge $1.00 for sharing a extra plate when sharing an entree, but that's well worth it because a lot of their entrees, you can easily share. For instance, their hamburgers start off as a half pound patty - that's two quarter-pounders at McDonalds. They also have a half pound hot dog, which two can easily share, especially if you add chili to it. 

However, quantity doesn't always mean quality. I find the taste of the entrees here to be disappointing. They look pleasing to the eye, but when you bite into the food, the flavor is missing. It's like you need a beer to enhance your taste buds. Without the beer, the food just doesn't cut it. 

Besides the nature of Happy Hour, the beer is the best thing about this place. Like any other Microbrewery, the beer stands out from the standard fare, maybe because it's more fresh, if that makes sense. 

All in all, though, it's really the only casually priced sit-down/wait service place in the Main Street/California Casino complex, and if you are in the mood for this type of dining and don't want to go outside, Triple 7 is an adequate choice. Beer and Sushi during Happy Hour, this would be a very good choice.",BmlwF7AX5gTpSXtyNdqpfg,0,0,3,yvgsukDV2tvRQ_gyceMDcA

I had read several reviews giving this eating establishment high marks.  The restaurant was very busy (about 7pm), but we were seated immediately without any delay.  There are long bars on each side of the room with seating in between.  Our server came right away, delivered menus, and took our drink orders.  They offer a sampler of 5 or 6 different micro-brews you can get for $5.50.  Two of us ordered this sampler.  I enjoyed all the varieties, but I think I like the ""Royal Red"" brew the best.  

The menu was quite varied.  I ordered the pale ale ribeye, medium well.  Sides were baked potato and green beans.  I also ordered an appetizer of fried calamari.  The calamari was some of the best I've ever had.  Generous portion, very crispy and light.  My steak came out more on the medium rare side instead of medium well.  I almost sent it back, but I don't really like to complain so I went ahead and ate all but the very center.  The sides were just okay.

The micro brews are surprisingly good. I don't mean to hate on Vegas beers, but when a restaurant offers a flight of five 5 oz pours for $5.99, you prepare for the worst. My flight came in a wooden holster and contained four of the regular beers and one seasonal flavor. I can honestly say that they were all very good.

The food is typical bar fare with a lot of burgers in the $7 to $8 range. Nothing is great but the prices are fantastic, so I'm not complaining. 

As you might expect, the main draw of Triple 7 is the craft beer. If you go, definitely focus on the drinks and limit the amount of food.",uTDxT-lAVI31gBg9Fgz8hQ,2,0,4,FN41EA092Y-35TInaHKWcA

I very rarely go for traditional dinner in Vegas, so trips to The Chart House, Vic & Anthony's or Hugo's Cellar kind of go out the window.  Aside from that, I just don't want to spend a fortune on a meal when I'm going to spend the balance of my evening gambling, drinking, and wandering around Fremont St.  

I usually wander over to the Triple 7 between 12 AM to 3 AM, and no matter what I've ordered, I've never had a bad meal there.  That's telling for me, because usually a place will have a few duds, and you just have to learn what not to order.  Trust me when I say the Triple 7 always delivers good food.  I read other reviews refer to this place as a gem, and they are correct.  It's what you want when you look to a meal you can enjoy at any hour.

Some of my ""Must Try"" recommendations are the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, Triple 7 Wings (when you're taking down a few of their Triple 7 Brews), Monterey Chicken Sandwich, Fish & Chips, or my drunken go to: Baked Italian Sub.  

Look, I could go on and on, if you're looking for a solid meal and you're downtown, this is by far the best place to eat at. Give it a shot....",yn_AuNAr6SaC9zxXcyRq7Q,3,1,5,HpOCsf3rLXHmCrnVkTnBdw

The last thing we need in our quest to get rid of our beer guts is a place that serves great beer and good food 24 hours a day. I've noticed some comment that the beer here is watery, but I've noticed that about all the Las Vegas micro brews I've had. I guess when you're in the desert, you just aren't in the mood for a heavy, particle filled beer. 

The bartender was really friendly and was patient with my friends who could not decide what they wanted. I went with the mango cream ale since I had heard a few people say it was really good. My friends both gave up trying to decide and went with samplers. I didn't know the samplers also included their seasonal brew (the mango cream ale) or else I would have gotten one as well. I enjoyed the ale a lot. The mango cream flavors were subtle. My friends both really like the Royal Red. One little quirk about the bar (or maybe it was just our bartender), but they could not take the tips while we were still there. He just left them on the bar even after we told him the money was for him.

There are no gaming machines at the bar, a rarity for a casino bar. If you'd like to get comp beers for playing, there is a bar in the casino that has all their beers on tap. You can also order their beers from any cocktail waitresses. That works out great since I do enjoy gaming, but I do still like to go into the brewpub once in awhile and pay for my beer (it is less than $4 for the large) so I can take in the atmosphere.

All of those dishes were forgetable, but my $8.99 pepperoni pizza was the best of the bunch. Eight very large slices (I only finsihed half) so this is shareable.

The space is rather large and there are two bars flanking either side of the dining room.  The brewing equipment is prominently positioned on two levels along the back of the restaurant.  It's a nice, open space and I felt very comfortable.

The bartender/server who attended to me was efficient if a bit abrupt.  That's okay--he's a bartender, not a waiter.  I prefer brusqueness to plodding service at the bar.  He wasn't chatty but he answered all of my questions and was quick with the refills.

The beer was fantastic and cheap.  I especially enjoyed the porter and the seasonal Oktoberfest.  Each style was well represented, which in my experience is rare in brewpubs.  There was a high level of consistency.  Plus, you could drink here all night and pay the tab with whatever's leftover from your taxi fare downtown.

For dinner I ordered a burger and fries, and they were acceptable.  The burger was cooked a bit longer than I would have liked but it tasted just fine.  I noticed that they also had a sushi bar adjacent to the regular bar.  That was unexpected and seemed a bit out of place in a brewpub, but hey!

I've stayed at Main Street Station many times over the years, eaten at their buffets, gambled for hours many times but never tried their brewery.  As long as i can remember, even when i turned 21 there was a brewery in this hotel and casino but i was never really into beers until a few years ago when the whole micro brew scene took off.  So i finally have sort of a taste for what styles of beer i like and don't like.

While walking outside the casino, i saw signs for $2.50 craft micro brews from their brewery on the Casino bar.  I had never noticed where the bar on the casino floor was because i always got free drinks while gambling.  I found the casino bar just to the left of the buffet.  Im not sure what they charge in the actual Micro brewery and Restaurant, but it was closed at the time and $2.50 sounds like a great deal to me.

I ordered the Black Chip Porter ($2.50) it came in a plastic cup, I'm not sure what they charge in the actual Brewery/Restaurant or the size that you get in the restaurant vs the casino floor.  I took a few sips and i wasn't too impressed with it, i just didn't care for the flavor.  I like dark beers, porters, stouts and dark ales, but i just didn't care for this one.  I actually ended up tossing it out after drinking about a third of it.  With that said I'd still come back and try their other beers, the Pale ale, hefeweizen, and their High Roller gold light beer look promising.  So although i didn't like their porter, i still have high hopes for their other beers, which i'll try on my next visit.",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,2,4,2,wTTQJkVd-Cz0dH--vNMIXg

I came here 3 times in the 5 days that I was staying in Vegas.

I also tried the nachos which is like an entree itself not an appetizer, and the wild mushroom pizza is also gooood.

Another awesome thing about 777 is that they brew their own beer.  I had a beer sampler (five 5-oz samples of all their microbrews: gold, pale, special, red, dark)  The gold and red beers were awesome!  Definite yummy.

I always bring visitors here bc the food here is a good mix of american comfort food with some asian influence. The only things I would say that are not so good is that the crab and artichoke dip had imitation crab and the chicken ciabatta sandwich had a little too much bell pepper.

Anyway, this place provides good service, good food, and good service at great prices. What's not to like about that?

The menu has a variety of dishes and house brews. There is something on the menu for everyone. And it's all super cheap. My meals consisted of the fish and chips, fish tacos, and a bacon cheeseburger. It was good, good, and super good.

Speaking of good, the service was as well. The servers were helpful, patient, and never screwed up an order, even if we had a party of 8 or more. Nice.

Our tables were next to each other but still didn't allow it us to put the tables together or closer to each other.  There are bar top seating also that should accommodate large groups if open.

They brew some really good beer which gives them some originality. There's also a sushi bar, weird because it gives you that typical bar feel but with sushi. Haven't tried the sushi, can't imagine it being any good but I wont know until I try them.

Food wasn't that bad but it didn't stand out as amazing. There was a chicken caesar salad which had too much cilantro. The prime rib plate came with choice of sides.  The prime rib was big but not the best cut of prime rib I've had.  There was a bunch of tough fatty pieces that was chewy. The bake potato was small and not so attractive and only came with packet sour cream and butter.

They also had a BBQ chicken breast and half rack of ribs combo.  Very delicious only suggestion is having the BBQ sauce on the side because it was spicy instead of sweet which they didn't mention.

I had their beers a long time ago. Can't judge them on it cause it was a long time ago and forget how it was. But local so that's a plus.

Trip #2 was definitely an improvement over the first time here in July.

The brewer made a special brew called ""Black Mud.""  I sat at a table that ordered five different beers here, and the Mud was literally 100x better than the regular brews here.  Some of them were quite bland, but the black mud was a kick in the pants -- the kind of kick you want to start off your Fremont Street Experience.

If you are a fan of glorified yellow water (Bud/Miller/Coors), go home.  If you care about calories, you wouldn't be drinking beer in the first place (a 50 calorie beer is... well... water).  If you prefer taste and quality, grab yourself a Black Mud.  If they don't have any more, demand the brewer makes more for your next trip.

This establishment is on the beer map in my mind with the Black Mud.  It's so-so without it.

2509093,2012-06-25,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"Decided to hit up the Triple 7 Brewery on a Friday night before beginning the Fremont Street festivities. I've eaten at the Main Street Station buffet many times and found it be one of the better budget friendly buffets out there. Unfortunately my experience at this venue was a far cry from it's dining counterpart at the Main Street Station.

We had a big party, 7 people, all hungry. It was Friday, so we expected a wait and were surprised when we were able to get a table quickly. The waitress was great. It took a little time to get our initial drink order, after that the service was flawless. Refills given before your mouth felt like the Sahara Desert, plates cleared quickly, and a friendly smile to go along with the prompt service. Too bad for her, the food the kitchen was putting out was sub-par.

So I ordered their classic cheeseburger, added avocado, and substituted onion rings for french fries. When the food came out the onion rings were barely above room temperature. They were soggy and literally had no flavor. Having had the misfortune in my youth of working as a dish washer at a restaurant I know a little about frying foods. This consistency only happens when something is fried, cooled, then fried again. No bueno. After a complaint to the waitress she brought a big stack of new onion rings to the table as several of us had ordered them. These were fresh and crispy. The burger itself was ordinary. Cooked okay, no great flavor, definitely expect more from a brewery. Everyone at the table at their meal, but no rave reviews. Prices are okay, definitely lower than the strip.

Fortunately this place is located near Fremont Street where I can drink my sorrows away and get some $1 fried twinkies.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,2,1,3,th47cgfmOSiaNEutw9i1CA

We always come after 11 for the special but we usually order more food than just the special. My boyfriend always gets the pizza and I usually get the jalapeño poppers with a few other things. Those jalapeño poppers are AMAZING. This time around I got wings and garlic fries. Honestly they were meh. But everything else I've had here was really great, from the margerhita pizza to the prime rib.

Again though, I can't stress how awesome Ron and Richard are!! I only come when they're here.

 I decided to give 777 another chance since my review back in March. I wish that I didn't. 

As I said in my prior review, the best thing here are the microbrews. Correction, the best thing about 777 WAS the microbrews. I ordered a High Roller and immediately noticed that it did not look the same. It used to be a golden color, now its more of a red/brown. 
I asked the bartender whats up with the beer and he said that they got a new brewmaster. The High Roller tasted nothing like before. The bartender said that many people have been complaining and offered to give me a different kind. I went with the Black Chip. It tasted like right (must have been an old batch before the new guy came).  
I ordered a burger and ate it at the bar and also ordered some korean tacos to-go. A few minutes went by and I noticed that the bartender quickly swap out my bill with a new one. I looked at it and he was charging me $2 because I was taking some food to-go. WTF? The bartender said he can't do anything about it and said he can get the manager. Yes, do that I requested.
The manager came out and I told him that I have been coming to 777 for 15 years and and this place has fell to $hit. I told him the food prices went up considerably and the quality has never got better. I also mentioned that the beer is not the same. He said its a different color but should taste the same. What?? This guy is clueless. Get a clue and rename your beers something else, and not try to pass off $hit as diamonds to your customers. 
I finally mentioned to him about nickel and dimeing me for $2 because I wanted to take an order home. He took the $2 off but still.

2566359,2013-01-10,1,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"When its 1am and you're in Vegas sometimes you just want to go down to the restaurant in your hotel and avoid any hassles. Triple 7's is a nearly 24hr restaurant located in the Main Street Station Casino and is a cooler looking spot to have a beer but lacks in the food department

Parking:
Tons of parking in the Main Street Casino Lot

Atmosphere:
Probably the coolest restaurant in downtown. Kinda of a Gordin Biersch type of feel.  Huge breweries on one side and kitchen on the other.

Service:
For the most part the 6 times I've eaten here went problem free. Sure most of the times its been after midnight when it was slow but all the waiters/waitresses have been more than adequate.  Beware of the weird hours.

Cost:
Prices will run you around 7-11$ per person but overall its pretty cheap.  If you're getting sushi(in which I never have) each item will run you about 3-4$ which can easily get pricey. During happy hour(3-6pm M-F) they have a decent happy hour of $5 appetizers and better yet $2 beer & wines.  If you happen to be from Hawaii and are here with ""Vacations Hawaii"" then this restaurant participates in the food voucher program but your selection is kind of limited to mostly burgers and appetizers.

Food:
So I've been here 6 times and for the most part I haven't been impressed. Sure most of the times I've had a free meal voucher which limited me to certain items but nothing was ""great"" on any of my trips. In fact my last visit I ordered the meat loaf which was just plain horrible. The meat loaf came out as a white pre made patty(which I assume was frozen) and has the texture of tofu made product.  The gravy was your typical packaged powered gravy that you would buy for $0.75 in the store.  If you go here stick with a simple burger or the pizzas have looked good

Conclusion:
Triple 7 looks the part of a good brewery restaurant but just doesn't cut it on the food end. I'm pretty sure they have the same chefs as the big buffet next door because the food seem to be mass produced and on the cheaper end.  If you need a place to watch a game or go for after hour then it's not bad but don't get your hopes up.",9fF_T3pQu3ay1oA7h_VYNA,2,0,2,xNIM2UaPlGJ0U8-ddJSZhw

It was quite nice actually, and if you like mushrooms, I highly recommend it!  My friends had some dishes that they didn't quite like though, including the personal pizzas, which were not unlike most generic casino pizzas, and the fish tacos.

The dining area is very large, and can accommodate the largest parties.  The walls are lined with various awards that they have received for their beers.  The brewery itself is clearly visible through the glass walls.  We watched a brewer do some house cleaning while we enjoyed our beers.  

Speaking of beer, the reason to come to the Triple 7 is the microbrewery.  I ordered the porter, which was a nice stout.  It was very smooth and tasty.  It paired well with my burger.  I also ordered a sampler of the other beers.  The Stout IPA they had specially for this season was also a really good beer.  I wouldn't say its the best stout that I have had, but the extra hoppy bite that it had was quite nice.  I wasn't impressed with the other brews, however.  The red ale was more of a light beer with a red ale tint to it.  The blackcherry stout was a sweet, cough syrup thing.  Non-beer drinkers might like that one.  The other light beers aren't really worth mentioning.  

Any brewer who experiments with craft beers in Vegas deserves a good review though. In my opinion, the food was good enough to come back for the beer.  Stick to the stouts though, as that seems to be the Triple 7's specialty.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,2,1,3,rkga9ShmL7yg-o6VnUKCqQ

Darn it.   We decided to head over to the Triple 7 inside of the Main Street Station because the word was they had dessert.  

When we arrived the hostess seemed put out by our party of 10 and said she would have to look for a table.  We glanced to our left and saw a long table with 12 seats and asked if we could sit there.  She said we could but if there were ten of us we'd have to all be on one check.  It seriously felt like she wanted us to leave.  We sat.

A server finally came by and got our drink orders and then after a while another server came by and told us she was back from break and could take our food orders.... drinks had yet to arrive.  I was very thirsty and asked if I could get a glass of water (which I had already ordered).  She told me the other server was placing that order. Soon after, the drinks did get delivered by server number two, however she started at the opposite end from me even though I was the one who asked.

A little longer wait and then the food arrived.  I had decided to get mozzarella sticks instead of dessert as nothing on the dessert menu sounded like all that.  When she delivered mine, I realized there were no set ups on the table, so I asked if I could get some napkins.  The server told me she'd get us silverware once she was done delivering food.  She finished delivering, went and got silverware and passed out one roll to each person... me last.  Then she walked away and came back with extra napkins which she dropped off at the other end of the table.  I was totally feeling invisible.

The mozarrella sticks were not that great.  hard and rubbery instead of melty and I shared them...  when I aksed for the bill, she dropped it off at the other end of the table, too.  So bizarre.

It's the kid of place that is pretty cool to hang out with co-workers or take a time out from the action of Fremont Street.  The atmosphere is always good, service is usually pretty good - though some of the ladies are better than others (I've never had a male server there).

It's mere blocks from where I work, so it tends to be someplace we fall back on, but in the past few months, I haven't had great experience when branching out on the menu.  Nearly everyone has a favorite food and doesn't eat much else.  We like the salads, pizza, grilled chicken, sushi and most of the appetizers. 

We keep going back because it's close, the drinks (at the Casino bar next to the buffet) are cheap and the service is pretty good.  They don't fret when 8 people come in all of a sudden and want a table.  If the food was better, they'd probably get 4 stars, but as it is, they get 2.

So... based on my experience - Do's and Don'ts

Do:
Stop at the Casino bar before coming in - the drinks are cheaper (.99 Margaritas, $1.25 beer)
Try the sushi - it's probably my favorite thing on the menu.  I've tried a variety of it and while the selection isn't huge, it is good.
Have a salad or something else that you know the kitchen has to make.  Much of the food is frozen, but the fresh things are good.

Don't:
Eat the burgers - they are frozen, premade patties that never taste good.
Make it complicated - the kitchen doesn't take change well
Try to get split checks - just come with cash if you're in a group.",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,2,0,2,M3684oGXHfgRYf40hhRjIQ

I ordered it medium rare and got a medium.  Added on the soup for a few dollars more and got a teacup size portion of really crappy soup.  Needless to say, portion control was strickly enforced and left me still very hungry

So hungry I ordered an appetizer, hot crab and artichoke dip.  It was like soup.  Need not say more.  Unfortunately, Yelp does not have negative ratings, or I would have given a minus 2.",e3wvaLlokmVk7RekpwuKyw,0,0,1,HT-xd7Tt67R8DMSMfPaokg

Was a bit quiet and limited in customers for a mid-day lunch, which was fine by me.  Menu was extensive as ever, with new items that I did not remember (i.e. beer battered tekka-maki - sounds pretty interesting, if not defeating the purpose of tekka-maki).

Anyway, I had a mediterranean chicken sandwich on ciabatta, with greens, roasted red pepper, balsamic, etc...  It was really good, flavorful, fresh, and had a huge roasted red pepper on it.  Came with fries, but I upgraded to onion rings for $1 more.  When the sandwich came, it had fries on the side.  Waitress corrected it quickly (left the fries but I did not eat them), onion rings came out fresh, and were very good, hot, with a good beer batter.

Will plan to coming back for happy hour to try the beer again, and other things.  Great varied menu, and really nice classic space in a classic casino design.",Oixv0VgElz8pxQFp2lkdJg,0,0,4,hJuNcWxoWk-uod1_7IAZvA

We walked around and did a little gambling when we decided to grab a quick bite. The prices were very affordable and food was pretty tasty. Just by a stroke of luck we walked in about 15 minutes before the end of happy hour. We each had a 12 count order of wings for only 4.99 each! Wow! Good, solid wings too! Also had the hot Italian sub sandwich for 7.99 as well. That was really tasty too!

The service was friendly and attentive despite the fact that it was fairly busy and our drinks never hit the bottom of the glass. A big way of gauging service for me. 

The atmosphere is great also. You have the brewery over on one side, TVs with sports scattered throughout, and that beautiful wooden decor that the whole casino has(which I'm definately a fan of).

2952879,2013-05-13,4,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"Walking through the Main Street Station was like a trip back in time. Balconies, tin ceiling and chandeliers oh my. Things were looking good so far as my friend and I made our way past the low limit tables and surly old gamblers toward the brewery. We were there on a Saturday night and the place wasn't all that busy. We decided to sit at the bar for dinner; easier access to the brews was my logic.

The selection is what you expect from any brew pub...a blonde, a brunette, a red head; yes I'm talking beer still. The entrees are subpar to say the least. The steak was not seasoned and the pork chop was very thin and tough; sawing through that was quite a feat. 

Bartender service; and I use that term very loosely:  very poor. 3 bartenders, 8 patrons at the bar including us. It took 10+ mins to be greeted and when we were it was not friendly at all. The bartender had to go back and forth between us and his POS for each item we ordered.  Really, you can't remember 2 simple orders for gods sake? How about a pen and paper to make up for your lack of memory or listening skills?  They never once checked on us during our meal. Was it because they knew the repsonse already? They never once offered us another beer.  Let's do some basic math for those following along; usually the higher the bill the higher the tip, no?  Finally, we are presented with the bill...finally we can leave and forget about the poor excuse for a bartender. Have you ever seen this?  Now he hovers in front of us waiting for us to tip/total and sign. Haha the joke is on you; you can stare us down all you want. You see, we don't like math either and the bill total plus ZERO tip is easy math. Get a clue...or better yet, a job that doesn't require customer interaction, common sense or the listening skills that even a 6 year old can handle.  One day, I'm going to see this guy standing on Fremont begging for money...yes, I will chuckle to myself, maybe a little out loud too. 

100% service fail leads to 1 star; your mediocre food and decent atmosphere is worth 2 stars but your staff brings you down to the lowest rating allowed by Yelp. I don't make the rules here; if I did you'd receive 0 stars.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,2,0,1,eaqqP5z-dht020DJuaDS6A

3027728,2018-03-16,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"i went here early afternoon with my wife to have lunch with here. It was the first full day of March Madness so I expected it to be crowded. What I did not expect was to have to wait because a quarter of the tables weren't being used because they didn't have a server for them. One would think that with it being March Madness, a bar that is showing the games would be fully staffed.

The process of looking over the menu and ordering our food was pretty standard and went off without any hitches. 

My wife ordered the Classic Cheeseburger well done and I ordered the BBQ Western Bacon Cheeseburger cooked medium. Our food was brought to our table and appeared to as we ordered it. However, my wife's burger was FAR from well done when she bit into it. We looked around for our waitress and noticed that all of the waitresses were huddled in one corner talking. Figuring that our waitress would be back momentarily to check on us, we decided to wait rather than waving her down from across the room. 

...And we waited...

...and we waited...

As another waitress was passing by, we unsuccessfully tried to stop her. She did not even acknowledge us as she zipped by. Even the guests at the next table stated that there was no way that she did not see us. A few moments later we noticed her coming by again and attempted to stop her. This time, without even breaking stride, yelled out...""YOUR server will be with you in a minute""...as she zipped by again. 

...and we waited...

A little while later, long enough for me to have eaten half of my burger, our server did return and we explained the issue with the burger not being well done. She was efficient in getting another one made and bringing it out, but by this time I was pretty much done with my lunch.

The burgers we had were average bar food and enjoyable. The fries are your basic crinkle cut fries, which I love, and were cooked very well. Crispy outside and hot and tender inside. We did not have alcoholic beverages but the iced tea I had was brewed well. 

All in all...Triple 7 Brewery is a microbrewery that can be a fun place to watch a game and have drinks. If this visit is indicative of the service though, I will pass.",XbJrFk5MpYwMjgQUplJTbA,0,0,2,kdb8tpuKrfRMQxzZPmMCLA

We did have to wait about 30 mins for a table, but it was a Friday night, so that can be expected. The sirloin steak I ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. It came with very good green beans and a baked potato. It was also a good size for $15.99. 

We also ordered raw oysters on the half shell that were pretty good (not as flavorful as the oysters in the South) and came with the usual horseradish, lemons, hot sauce, etc on the side. Six oysters for $9.99. =)

Our waitress didn't see us seated in her section for quite a while, which was getting frustrating, but we were seated in the corner out of view.

I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of beer at Triple 7.  Coming into a casino, you wouldn't expect a brewpub to hold up, but don't let the location fool you.  They brew about 7, rotating varieties, and I tried them all.  The stout and porter tasted generic, and the red was just okay, but the Double IPA and the Pale Ale were quite nice and tasted as good as any other mass-produced brand.  It was hoppy, bitter, and tasty.

The prices are ridiculous as well.  For $4 you get a 16oz pour, or for $4.50 you get a 22oz.  Or, you can get a 5, 5oz sampler for $6.  Then to match they have a Happy Hour to knock those prices down even further.

It's located right downtown and is within walking distance to the Fremont strip.  In the future I wouldn't mind stopping in here for my beer fix and getting a quality brew instead of paying the absurd strip prices at other bars downtown.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,zu5hUxVcJ0wYnAaglL5stg

One of the reasons I chose this restaurant was the on site brewery, but when I opened the menu to the beer to see what local micro brews were available, I was told that they were out of three of their six options. The one I ordered tasted more like the ubiquitous coors lite than a craft brew.

Triple 7 is a cool local place that serves cheap (VERY DECENT) craft beers (23 oz $3.95) and typical bar foods (CHEAP) with sushi randomly thrown in there. 

From my experience... skip the prime rib, it was pretty ugly, overcooked and well ugly.  They run food specials all the time depending on the nearby holiday, but your mileage will vary on the taste. Stick to the classics (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc) to be safe. 

They brews come in a good classic variety: kolsch, pale lager, red ale, stout, and porter. They carry special releases like their cherry stout that I heard is a must.

Sathy T. and Tim C. from LA just happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time that I was. After I had finished my family duties, Tim, Sathy, and I agreed to meet in Downtown Las Vegas for after dinner snacks! 

Triple 7 Restaurant & Brewery at the Main Street Casino was a logical choice. 

Some of the features of this venue include the helpful and friendly service, free parking, convenient location, and cool atmosphere - is the variety of beers and good food! 

BEER: Sathy ordered a Blonde Beer called the High Roller Gold.  She really enjoyed it because I didn't even get to taste it! Hahaha! Just kidding! 
Tim's Dark Beer was the Blackchip Porter with hints of toffee and chocolate. The server offered him a sample first - that's great customer service!  He liked it and got the large glass. ..yay!  Because I liked it, too - which was a pleasant surprise. I secretly wished that I had gotten this beer, so I could have it all to myself... but Tim shared and I drank about half because it was so smooth and mellow! 

FOOD: I was more hungry so I got the Dragon Roll sushi which was satisfying.  I liked the shrimp in the middle and unagi (eel) on the top. The combination tasted yummy to me! 
Another pleasant surprise was the dozen Fresh Oysters. They were the most plump and meaty oysters I have ever had!  Our server said that the oysters came from Louisiana. Whoa!  Thanks to Sathy for sharing her rations - she only ate two so Tim and I had 5 each! Nom nom! 

I have been to this restaurant in the past and I will continue to return - not only because they accept the coupons from our Vacations Hawaii meal coupon book - but also because of the reasonable prices and Aloha Spirit hospitality!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,24,32,4,q3HZctQ7pvxEaxlc5LGP6g

This place looks like someone built a brewery around a sports bar that happens to have a sushi station in it. Really need looking. Large televisions with sports or ESPN playing and giant beer tanks. Tons of tables and tons of noise. 

I ordered the chicken strip meal $10.99 and a water. Omg the water and soda cups are huge!!! I felt like I had just ordered a big gulp. Amazingly enough i ordered another water. The heat makes you thirsty. The chicken strips are huge you get three big strips that are about the size of half a chicken breast each. They are so juicy. I ordered ranch and honey mustard to dip. Stay away from the honey mustard it has a reddish-orange color and doesn't taste right. The ranch is good though! Also comes with fries, carrot and celery, and cole slaw. I thought the cole slaw was bland not enough dressing. The fries were perfect. All and all I would ask for extra ranch. So much food between the 8 of us!!! 

Good to order: chicken strip meal, fried calamari, bucket of shrimp, cheese bread.

Triple 7 also takes vacations hawaii meal coupons. I have actually used 2 meal coupons and got my dinner for free. The waiter hooked me up so I had to hook him up with a nice tip.

Not a lot, but we venture out a lot and aren't usually in the Casino's until later in the evenings.  One of the must haves for me is their oyster shooters.  Nothing really special about them but they're a great price.  Plus they usually have 2 oysters per glass, better deal.  Oh, yah, don't forget the beer too.  If you have a meal book from the hotel they even cover some of the items they sell.

We went for happy hour one day when we were unloading all our shopping back at the room.  We decided to have some drinks and pupu.  We ordered their new flat bread pizza, deep fried calamari, spicy tuna maki roll, and their oyster shooters.  I had a Blackchip porter and my wife had a mojito.

The flat bread pizza was supposedly a new menu item.  It had good flavor but being a pizza lover I wished it had a more crispy crust.  Still, a good pizza.  Their deep fried calamari is really good.  Their batter is very light and very crispy.  Goes perfectly with their dipping sauce.  The spicy tuna roll was better than you'd expect from a bar in Vegas.  I've had better, but I'va also had worse.  The oyster were just as I remembered.  If you want to kick it up a notch you can also get it with a shot in each glass.  I passed.  I spiced it with a little of the calamari ""cocktail"" sauce, lemon, and tabasco.  I wished I had some Hawaiian chili pepper water from back home.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive.

The second visit was later at night--about 2 am.  They were still bustling.  I got their Red Ale this time.  I ordered the 24oz and the waitress told me she'd get me a 16oz as it was on special for $2.  That's good customer service.  We also got the calamari again and  their artichoke dip.  The artichoke dip was good.  Had a layer of cheese on it.  It was thinner than I was used to having but it came with chips and garlic bread.  It was really good spread on the bread.  The calamari wasn't as good this time.  The peices were bigger and their was a puddle of oil on the bottom of the basket.  A turn off for my wife.  Other than that, it was overall a really good experience still.  I kind of wish I got more oysters but it was only our late night snack before bed.

Next time I'm back in Vegas, soon hopefully, you can be sure I'll be back here again.  Happy Eats!",nEOnaMuWd8yaFWW6jPTPXQ,3,0,4,AVNrHOnBSu8_tbacjDpEbA

There wasn't anything too special about it, aside from the price of course. If I remember correctly I had the Pale Ale and tried a couple of other samples.

There's a bunch of not-so-cleverly named, in-theme stuff at high prices, which can be a crap shoot.  So when a bartender at a brewery kiosk in the Planet Hollywood mall referred us here, it stuck out, and we decided to pile in the car and make the trip; while we could expense crappy food all we needed, deep down, it wasn't what we were craving.

Naturally, particularly for my colleagues not so experienced in Vegas, the step off the strip into downtown is a fun one.  You get the proper desperate-folks-in-a-smoky-hole vibe that is so missed these days.  Main Street Station, where the Triple 7 is located, is no exception.

The brewpub is by far the nicest part of it.  Old-fashioned looking without looking yellowed.  Enough plasma screens to remind you that the 80's have long passed.  Clean, but comfortable and lived-in.

The beers are solid, with the pale ale truly outstanding--they have GABF banners on the walls from years past and it's not a stretch to see why.  The waitstaff knows enough about the food and the beer, to boot.

There's the cheap-steak option which i'm told was pretty good, but i went for beer-battered chicken fingers with beer barbecue, which was awesome.  It's all very plainly made with some care, and delicious.

""Why not try something new?"" Everything I have tried in the last 3 visits were all mediocre. I do have to say, this place claims to have award-winning microbrews and is known for their hand-crafted beer so food may not be their specialty.

SERVICE
It really depends on who you get. Sometimes you get an attentive/friendly server constantly checking up on you and have conversation with you. Then there are other times you get a moody/bitchy server who seems to be having the worst day of her life. 

FOOD 
Philly Cheese Steak? Meh. Flavor was non-existent
Chicken Breast Marsala? Chicken cooked with Marsala wine sauce. Meh.
Monterey Chicken Sandwich? Chicken topped with Pepper jack cheese and avocado. Meh.
Fish and Chips? Seems to be the popular item here. Tartar sauce on the side was good but fish was so dry. Meh.

I felt like leaving this place with all the disappointing food but then their old fashioned root beer float called my name. 

It's a vanilla ice cream with Henry Weinhard's Old School Root Beer. Oh My God.  It's a simple, lovely delight. I've never been a fan of root beer float but wow. Where have you been all my life?

Totally.  Fricken'.  Awesome.  If you go here, go here for the BEER!  I am not a drinker in the slightest sense (even though I do occasionally 'Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol') but Triple 7's award winning brews are top notch!  Some of the best hand crafted beers you'll find in all of Las Vegas!  Seriously!  Yes...in lil' old Main Street Station casino!  Haaaawaaaiian!  Cheeeeee Pono!  And yes, yes my friends...you will see many island people in the middle of winter dressed in t-shirt, shorts, and rubber slippers.  Tips:  ""Howzit brah"" means 'hello', and ""Brok' da mouth ONO"" means 'yummy'.  Local speak!

Want to experience good drink and food on the cheap-cheap?  Go to Triple 7 during their popular HAPPY HOUR!  Going from 3 PM - 6 PM M-F (except holidays and Monday Night Football) you can get wine and well drinks for $2.00, or a 16 oz. microbrew beer for $2.00 too!  That's a lot of brew for a little buck!  It is a great time to try each of their five or six brews they have on tap.  My favs are:

-High Roller Gold (their flagship wheat beer)
-Marker Pale Ale (light and bitter with a clean finish)
-Black Cherry Stout (seasonal, with hints of chocolate and cherry)

But trust me, each of their beers are phenomenal and go great with their menu.  On the Happy Hour menu for $4.50 you can have your choice of items that include a dozen chicken wings, 20 peel-n-eat shrimp, fried calamari, and a California Roll.  So cheap and so good!

And don't forget their regular lunch and dinner menu!  Triple 7's Legendary Garlic Fries ($3.95) are very good, and so are their Nachos Grande w/ Chicken ($8.95).  Share with some friends!  They also do soups, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, and burgers.  I really enjoy their Teriyaki Burger ($7.95) and their Mushroom Burger ($7.95).  For you non meat eaters, with their burgers you can substitute a grilled chicken breast for no extra charge!  

Triple 7 also has Brewmaster's Favorites and Dinner Specials on their menu.  The Fish and Chips ($9.95) are battered in their own Marker Pale Ale then deep fried.  Excellent with a brew to wash it down.  Also popular is their 1/2 pound Prime Rib dinner ($8.95) with veggies and a baked potato.  Go meat!

So if you're down on your luck at the craps table or that slot machine (Damn you Wizard of Oz!  Damn you!), that leftover scratch you got will get you a cool brew and some warm eats to drown away those sorrows.  Lost Wages, anyone?  Get down to the Triple 7 to get your pub grub on!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,4,3,pAnWrzfsn8B3MSC0eJYbOw

Their pale ale was a little more hoppy and tasted like it should. Beer, unfortunately, was the most disappointing part of the lunch.

Well, one day the blackjack dollars ran out a bit too quickly, so off to Triple 7 we went.

My husband and I split artichoke and cheese dip.  This comes with tortilla chips and pieces of garlic bread.  Overall, bland...I wouldn't suggest ordering it.

4172902,2008-08-03,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"Came here for the very first time this past weekend (Friday lunch to be exacty) to check out what the hype was...  Left VERY happy and VERY satisfied (and drrrrunk!) customers!

Brother and I managed to try a few beers:
The guest brew -- mango cream ale.  Surprisingly refreshing, not sweet at all like you would think.
The brewmaster's special -- Weisenbock (sp?).  STRONG!  Quite good and got even better when it warmed up a bit...  Just a bit.
The red.  A lot less...  reddish? than I expected.  I liked it a lot but it was a bit anticlimactic after the Weisenbock.  Good 'tweener though (between strong beers).
The pale.  AWESOME!!!  Definitely would be my go-to beer if I hung out here more (and believe me, both my brother and I for sure will be back)!

The food was delicious and came out piping hot for every order we got.  Cheesy bread was great -- a number of different cheeses make their way onto that goodness.  Garlic fries were crunchy on the outside, nice and fry-esque on the inside, LOTS of garlic = LOTS of delicious!  My brother ordered the oysters topped with the crab and artichoke dip...  Oh.  My.  SOOOOO GOOD!!!  Dip wasn't overwhelming or overly rich, and whatever brine the oysters are in accentuates them perfectly.  Plus there was a soft toasted garlic bread that sopped all this amazingness up!

But the crowning jewel in our visit here was my order:  OYSTER SHOOTERS (with vodka -- you get a choice of vodka or tequila).  Just an explosion, literally, of flavors in your mouth...  We like to put Tabasco and a lil dash of black pepper in ours, and it tastes absolutely yummy.  I don't even like Bloody Marys that much...  But these came out SO GOOD and SO CHEAP at that!!!

Friends, Yelpers, beer lovers -- lend me your stomachs (and livers).  DROP BY TRIPLE 7!!!  Prices are right, grub is great, alcohol is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Everyone will find something they love here, I guarantee it :)",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,0,0,5,6i_KLTFcxKaD5qd2uYvUGw
4214825,2012-06-28,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"We enjoyed our meal here during our recent Vegas downtown experience.  Boyfriend wanted cheap prime rib, so he searched yelp and found this place.  He ordered a larger cut, so it was like ~$14 maybe (?) and scarfed it down.  I tried a bite and agreed that it was very tender and juicy.  Worth it.

I had the mahi dish.  Unfortunately the vegetable side is just one kind of veggie, and it happened to be grean beans.  I only like green beans if they are really fresh and these seemed a little wilted, so I didn't eat many.  Also, it came with a huge serving of white rice (seriously like two gigantic ice cream scoop-sized mounds), most of which I didn't eat either.  So I felt a little badly wasting the food.  If I'd known, I would have requested less rice and a side salad instead, or something.  Anyway.  Then the fish itself was overcooked and kind of dry.  I don't mind it being on the more well done side of things, but overcooked is going too far.  The only redeeming quality of the meal was the amazing pineapple salsa chutney sauce...I just slathered every bite of fish with the sauce and it made everything better!  Delish.

We loved the beer sampler (6 samples for $5.50!!  so cheap!).  I enjoyed the mango beer (although bf thought it was too sweet).  I also really liked the porter.  Bf liked the red and the pale ale.  So it was a perfect balance for the meal.

The atmosphere was like any brewery/restaurant..think Gordon Biersch.  But it was pleasant inside, lots of TVs, and the service was pretty good.

We'd definitely go back, and I would just order something different...probably sticking with the more traditional ""bar food"" or just getting a prime rib of my own. :)",eM3mXwH7JOqqZDlVBGeWgw,1,0,3,I8O8w9dCW8PkwTFS0-ia2Q

The food was average......the beer is good (but I can get it for free at Boar's Head Bar or on the Casino Floor).  

My check came and I was less then impressed.  My food was acceptable, but the way this place has been promoted to me for years (in those years I stayed at MSS) and I've had better food at Four Queens (Magnolia's).

We tried all of the house brews; my favorite was the Red Lager. During happy hour I believe the beers cost $2.50. I think I paid about $4.00 dollars. What the heck? That is super cheap for a craft beer! 

The food is good; we tried the sweet potatoes fries, garlic fries and Buffalo wings. Everything was super tasty, particularly the garlic fries and the wings. It is bar food though, so I would stick with burgers and appetizers.

But I do have a few problems with the joint. First off, I've been charged 3 different prices for the same 16 oz beers, which makes recommending this place difficult. I was telling my friend Main Street has $1.75 beers, because I was charged that before. The next time was 2-something and the next time was $3.50 a piece. Very confusing. 

Also, being a restaurant that is in a hotel and doesn't offer room service, I find it very ridiculous they charge 2 dollars for every to go order. Since I know this, I usually order my food, eat a morsel and immediately ask for a box. Seems less efficient for them, considering now they have to clean my plates, and my seating area just because I was avoiding a $2 charge. It's not that I don't want to pay 2 bucks, but I think whoever is serving me deserves that $2 tip, not the restaurant. 

 Also, they will not take an order over the phone so you can pick it up. Not even for hotel guests, not even with the $2 charge. It is inconvenient and I'm sure has lost them plenty of money, as they just lost my business for dinner this afternoon.",qGohxVLB1LqHfKid40w_vA,0,0,3,aFVZcxagG4cQyGz9yzSxUg

There is a weekday Happy Hour, but we just missed it.  Also, don't depend on the website for prices, as they were slightly higher when I looked at the current menu. 

There was quite a crowd- it's a popular spot. We went to the bar, and the hostess said she'd get us a table as they opened up, because nothing was open. So we went to the bar, which was about 75% capacity, when we arrived. And about 20 minutes later, it was full. My friend had a soda, and I had a glass of merlot (not bad)- for both drinks, it was less than $6. There was only one bartender- and he was busy. He was nice, though; he gave us the receipt so we could show it to the server, for a free refill on the soda. 

So our friend got there and she got us a table (??? not sure but I think that the hostess forgot about us, because people kept coming inside, and getting tables). Our server was busy too. So we ordered 6 rolls (spicy tuna, california roll, caterpillar & philadelphia) and split them. The bill was $51- which between 3 people, plus tip, was $20 each- that wasn't bad. 

I like that the restaurant space is very wide open and not dark at all- with a view of the brewery too. If you don't wanna wait, I suggest you get there early, especially on a Friday night. Lunch & Dinner menu has appetizers, salads, soups/chili, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, brewmasters favorites, dinner specials, & desserts. I don't drink beer so I can't tell you anything about it, except that the prices seem reasonable. The last time I was here (my previous relationship), I had the peel and shrimp bucket deal (it's pretty big).

Triple 7 is a micro brewery... And I have to say, EW. I had the pale ale and well, it goes in tasting like Sierra Nevada and once it settles in your stomach, UGH!!! Horrible after taste! That alone prevents me from ever drinking any of their brews-- EVER.

The saving grace for this review NOT being a 1-Star review is the fact that the guacamole burger wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be! LOL But when you slap some guac on anything, it always tastes 10 times better!

My uncle and his wife are from small town America...very small town. My uncle has ventured out into the world a few times when he was in the service, but his wife has traveled mostly within the the midwest and south. They wanted to take us to dinner, and wanted to stay on Fremont as that is where their hotel was. 
After debating between Chicago Brewing Co and Triple 7, we decided on Triple 7 as it had been almost 5 years since the last time we were there.

We arrived and had to wait in line for about 20 minutes. It was Friday night and the place was hopping. We didn't mind waiting as it was a good time to catch up. 

Once we were seated, the waitress helped us immediately. Over the course of the night, the waitstaff was really friendly and very helpful. For drinks, my self and my cousin ordered a couple micros. I had my traditional Red (the Royal Red Lager) and he had the brewmaster's special (an IPA). Later I had the sampler...but I will get to the beer in a second. 

The menu had a few veggie options, which was totally unexpected. They also had a presumingly vegan option (veggie sushi). I had the roasted veggie sandwich, and the wife got the veggie sushi. My family had burgers and chicken fingers. My sandwich was very good, a little messy by the veggies were roasted quite nicely and the fries were pretty amazing. It was like having 2 sandwiches, which is why the wife and I shared. The veggie sushi (avocado, carrot, red pepper) was very tasty as well. 

On to the important part, the beer. The Royal Red was pretty light (similar to a Killian's). It was malty, but not too strong. It went down smooth, but not the best local red I've had. I also had the sampler. Overall the beer quality was pretty average. The pale ale had a nice wheat aftertaste, and was pretty smooth. The IPA was hoppy, but more earthy than anything else. Admittedly, I usually don't like IPA's, but this one I disliked for the earthy flavor, not the hoppiness. 

Overall, this was a good choice. We would definitely return for the food. I wouldn't come just for the beer, but it was decent, and I would support the localness of it.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,1,0,3,kUvn27GtDub9xrY4CUTICQ

I hit this spot pretty regularly whenever I am in Vegas (because Downtown gambling and people-watching FAR outranks the Strip).  It has all the bad food you crave during the rat race of salads and Diet Cokes.

Even if there is a line out front, waiting to get in, just hang tight because it moves fast, no matter how large the group.  Very similar to a buffet cattle call.

The menu is quite large with a wide range of items ranging from fish and chips, to a wide range of sandwiches including reuben, philly cheese steaks and even pizza. I went with a reuben, well because it is my favorite sandwich in the world. It was quite a let down. The meat itself was still a little cold, and everything else was pretty dry. Nothing to rave about, but I've had worst reubens.

First of all, I love Vegas. Not only that, I am IN LOVE with Vegas. 
We found this spot by accident. It was the middle of the day, we were pretty lit and in serious need of food time. Somehow we found this place while just exploring! 
Huge high ceilings make this place really inviting. Also, I really love breweries that CELEBRATE the fact that they are a brewery. Instead of having just a normal restaurant, the big beer tanks are visible through large, high windows. 
The beer is excellent (although I had to go slow on those, and only during and after eating since I was pretty buzzed off margaritas from Coyote Ugly when we arrived). 
The food is very very good! And seriously I'm not just saying that because I was drinking. Their calamari was the best I have ever had. It was fried to perfection and covered in jalapenos so it was super super spicy!! Sissy and I still talk about it every time we have calamari somewhere:

A little before 3, he hooked me up with a 16 oz mango hef and told me he would add it on the bill at 3 for the $2.  Normal prices are 16 oz for $3.26 and 23 oz for $3.95, so during HH you can get 32 oz for $4, a good deal.  Lots of brewmaster's specials, but I only wanted the mango and one was enough to get me a bit tipsy.  To counter that, I ordered the Thai chili wings (1 dozen for $4.50 during HH) and chatted up a random Vegas-defect who was at the bar.  The wings were crispy, hot, and delicious.

4610834,2012-07-15,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"What can be said about a restaurant that fits the classic stereotypical Las Vegas establishment? You know...the one where there is cheap shrimp cocktail, decent drinks, and service that makes you feel you are at a diner, yet not? Well those same emotions came to light at Triple 7 where I found the food comfortable, service just a tad lacking, and prices rather cheap.

The menu features an eclectic fare of American classics, sushi, and of course shellfish. Never thought I could get a prime rib at the same place I could get a California roll? In either case, the food wasn't bad but at the same time not great. It was decent. Nothing special. I found the oysters a tad gritty while the shrimp were on the smaller side. 

Service was a little lacking. It took us awhile to get service once we were seated and while the food didn't take long to come, drinks went empty and it took awhile for water to refill. 

Ambiance is comfortable with a town tavern type of feel. Seating can be a little tight so you might not want to have what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas conversations. Prices are very reasonable with entrees being in the $10-15 range and they offer some cheap drink options including evening $2-5 beers.

4655347,2015-10-12,9,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"Review #777

    Yelp Review 777 only appears once in a Yelper's life. I couldn't think of a luckier  place to write about for the landmark Yelp review 777 than 777 Microbrewery and Restaurant in the downtown Las Vegas.

   Where Yelp review #777 appears once in my lifetime, the Triple 7 Microbrewery appears often. The surface parking lot at Main Street Station is my parking place of choice when I visit the Fremont Street Experience. The deal is that you have to buy $5 worth of food or drinks to validate the $5 to use the parking lot. Usually I make a beeline to the Triple 7 for a lucky cold one or two before a night on Fremont Street. The problem is that the beer is so inexpensive causing me to buy two to cover the validation. For example, currently draft beer is $2 during football. That was the case yesterday when I drank a large draft strawberry beer that came out to  $2.16 after tax. 

   Triple 7 is an upbeat spot to enjoy a couple of Lucky cold ones. The atmosphere is rock & roll music, professional sports, bar talk, and the 1800s railroad station motif that permeates Main Street Station. Yesterday I'd take in U2's ""With or Without You"" between glances of a soccer and baseball game. Triple 7 is a cavernous bar and restaurant with high ceilings bordered by two large bars and a microbrewery. The large space in between is filled with tables. From past experience, the bar on the right is the quiet bar that is frequently closed where the bar on the left is the party bar. Regardless of where you sit, a lucky strawberry or any microbrewery beer tastes good.

   Yesterday, I took my Triple 7 experience to the next level by returning for dinner. Besides being a microbrewery, it is the unofficial cafe of Main Street Station unless you count the cafe in its sister property The California. After spending time in the Fremont Street Experience, I returned for dinner. Let me say that I was impressed. I ordered the meatloaf which included a vegetable of choice and mixed vegetables for $8.99. My choice of vegetable of the day was a baked potato. I added soup of the day for an additional  $1.99. Complimenting the food, I passed over a beer for Pepsi. The chicken gumbo soup with saltine crackers was of the same high quality as their beer. But the meatloaf was the bomb. The quality and quantity satisfied my expectations. The tasty mushroom gravy with genuine mushrooms brought the meatloaf to a level that exceeded my expectations for a microbrewery restaurant. The baked potato that included butter and Land O Lakes sour cream was  mutant. I don't recall eating a baked potato this large. Ultimately the soda glass was huge. All this came out to around $15.25.

    Throughout dinner, the waitress was attentive and friendly. Additionally she did not make the error of serving the soup too close to the entree or rush me.

  When I drink a cold one in Triple 7, it is ""Cheers "" to good luck. In conclusion Review 777 is an Internet toast ""to good luck and good times.""",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,15,4,312XJu8zUV51s8lzR8V5LA
4698203,2013-06-13,1,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"There are two microbreweries on or near the old strip. This is the only one where the beer is brewed on location. 

Triple 7 is an interesting space. It's like a pub meets sushi bar meets, well, Vegas. Brick walls, plenty of seating, big tall ceilings and yes, a sushi bar with a big neon sign behind it. 

If you're coming in for the first time, order a tour of microbrews, the sampler is only $5.99. 
Do you like mango? Try the mango hefeweizen. Light in flavour, it goes down easily... too easily. You'll want more! For something a little different, the King's Kolsch is a lemongrass beer surprise! It seems to be an up and coming flavour in everything from beers to vodkas. I'd ask for a sample sip before you order... just to make sure you can handle an entire pint of it.

If you're hungry, might I suggest the Korean short ribs and Korean tacos? I know, weird to have a Korean influence in a microbrewery right? Not any more odd than a sushi and oyster bar. Anyway, both are delicious and both come with a side order of cucumber kimchi. The short ribs were saucy and delightful, though my server, Monique had a description that gave them way more justice than I ever could. The tacos came in a half soft, half crunchy shell and had that same bite. After those and my tour of beer, I was so very full!

Tip: If you're going to order some sushi, you won't be able to do it right from the sushi bar. You'll still need to go through your server! Just roll with it...

We ordered the prime rib meal $13.99 comes with a veggie and a carb (delicious steamed rice,  baked potato or mashed).   The quality of the beef wasn't that great but it was cheap so okay.  

Tons of huge flat screens line the walls so there were no bad views of the game.   Waitress was pleasant and our food came quickly.  

Aaron Rogers threw a Hail Mary to throw the game into OT and the ""Packers side "" of the place went crazy.    There was some poor chap in a faded Brett Favre Jersey who was crying his eyes out then started cheering.  Packers ended up losing in OT and it was back to crying again.

The Main Street Station isn't the fanciest of hotels, but it is still very clean and well kept. The 777 is definitely a diamond in the rough.

The 22oz large beers are great and fairly affordable for Vegas. They have a nice selection of house brews. I had the red ale and my buddy had the porter. Being a home-brewer myself, it was great to check out all of the brew equipment while waiting for the food.

I ordered the bbq chicken pizza. This thing was huge, easily 10-11"". I am a big guy and it filled me up plus leftovers. The crust was very crispy/chewy. A great interpretation of a NY crust. My friend had the portobello burger. He was totally stuffed afterward.

Triple 7 is a restaurant/brewery located in the Main Street Station in downtown Vegas. They have a variety of standard bar type food (burgers, sandwiches, fried stuff) but they also have a sushi bar, which is cool.

But the best part in my opinion is that they brew their own beer. According to the menu they do a few hundred gallons at a time. When we dropped in they had 7 beers ranging from a pilsner to a stout so there's something for everyone. We did a taster and the styles were accurate and all very tasty. Great beers, all.

There are other reasons why we just chose one brewery on this trip. Some of you probably can guess why one was chosen if you have been reading my reviews of the past month. That though is only half the story and I will tell the full spectrum of that story at a later time.
We chose Triple 7 simply because they had a good overall score here on Yelp! They also had brews that I haven't heard of before. Like a Watermelon Hefeweizen! Well by the time we got there they didn't have the Watermelon Hefe anymore but they did have a Mango Hefe which I immediately ordered! This unusual Hefe went down smooth and tasted awesome. But only one beer allowed for this bird!
The food at Triple 7 I could have take it or leave it. It is funny. Many people often say how good casino food is and how cheap it is. On this trip at least not so much. The food is mid priced I would say and often times is sub par to a regular restaurant outside The Strip. 
I ordered a Taco Salad here and it tasted fresh enough but also seemed uninspired and didn't really have the TLC needed to make it a good dish. The guacamole also tasted a bit odd. 
If Triple 7 didn't have such good beer I would not have been so generous on the star giving. The food didn't impress me and was one of my least favorite meals. But not the beer. Ho no!",E_GAXhVA1_lVC2aFpMQElA,3,1,4,9pevSmpfwdNT8HB2JcRZYw

Nothing really special about it, except the dessert... the deep fried cheesecake. 

It was good, but not good enough to plan an exciting adventure to this dessert, (check out some of my other reviews, I've had a few adventures ;) ) 

Service was ok.  Food was bleh-ok. So-so. 

The waitress we had seemed to be waiting on ALL the other tables on our side of the restaurant. It wasn't packed, but it wasn't empty. There were two waitresses working during a Saturday lunch time. I can see why it wasn't packed. We didn't get any rude service, but didn't get any great service. She didn't check on us enough to be qualified as great-excellent service. Other than taking our order & giving us the check, she checked on us maybe... twice. She seemed like she was just there. Just there for work. Sorry, that won't score you a good tip. 

We ordered calamari, the fries, a few dishes, some sushi, and the cheesecake. All of it was okay so-so. 

Nothing great about the calamari or fries, fries came with a few dipping sauces. The seasoning on the fries seem to separate from the fries. That doesn't make the fries tasty. The calamari was so-so as well.

No one at our table really liked the dish they got. It was all just okay. Nothing bad. Just so-so quality. I got the fried sushi roll, there was nothing tasty about it. I've had fried rolls before (at breweries/bar type places) and they were delicious. So I was disappointed with this one. I've been to other non-Japanese or non-Asian breweries and bar type places that have good sushi. 

Other dishes we ordered were philly cheesesteak it was okay. My brother barely ate half of it. My other brother ordered fish and vegetables, he said it was bland. He only took a few bites and didn't eat the rest. And they usually eat a lot! 

We ordered the caterpillar roll, but the waitress gave us a california roll and charged us for caterpillar roll. (it's a few dollars more than a california roll.) 

She apologized for it, and changed our bill, but again... she just seemed like she didn't care to serve us (or maybe be at that job.) Who knows... 

The fried cheesecake was good, my first time trying it, so I'm glad that was more than okay. But it was just good, not great. Maybe that's also because of the disappointing service and all the other food we had while there. 

No one really enjoyed their food, so we probably won't be here again. 

If I ever go there again, I'm gonna have to try the mango brew.  They didn't offer us any beer menus so how was I suppose to know?",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,1,0,2,7ARX9r3NpeLHuF0kblw8mw

Not all of their brews are created equally, but it is a true microbrewery with craft creations. If you're a beer person, it should be on your short list of places to visit when in Vegas. What better excuse to drink than ""you can only have it here""? 

I sampled the strongly recommended black cherry stout, and it was complex with some coffee notes. Nothing weak about it, and you can definitely taste the cherry. Deliciously intoxicating. 

I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and non-smoky the entire Main Street Casino was, and Triple 7 is spacious with super tall ceilings, which is such a refreshing change from the dark cavernous video poker establishments that dot every corner. 

Service was fine. The food was average, plenty of fried, meaty items. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich, and it was acceptable. Their salad was a below average iceberg creation, so it's not really worth the extra bucks. Just accept you're going to be eating french fries if you head this way.

5209717,2011-01-28,1,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"I'll make this my 100th review because this place is pretty freaking awesome and it's a total hidden gem that I've been frequenting for many years. Greedy me hopes that not too many people find out about this place....horrible I am!!! D=

First off, the parking can't get any better. This restaurant is located inside Main Street Station Casino and the Main Street parking structure is never overcrowded, and it's like 20 yards from the casino entrance. No hassle parking always makes for a happy camper, especially with how Vegas has become so commercialized and BIG. You can't go anywhere without parking a million miles away from where you are trying to get to.

Next, they have tons of beers that are actually brewed here, so you can get some very chilled, fresh brewed beer. I suggest that you start off with a super tall beer before you order. Most are pretty potent so you will be fairly lit before your food comes.

The food is great and the variety is quite interesting. They have sashimi and assorted sushi which has been really fresh and well prepared every time I have ordered it, and the prices are very reasonable. The sandwiches, burgers, and other entrees are also good and consistently prepared. I haven't had anything that I didn't like here, let's put it that way.

Oh yeah and have another beer with your food...don't forget about that. Why get half intoxicated when you can go all the way!!!

The service is excellent with a super friendly staff, and normally there isn't much of a wait, if at all. When you are done, there is a skywalk across to California Casino, and Binions and Fremont are just across the street. Golden Nugget is barely a block away. Good spots for some action wtihout all the hassle of the Strip....well unless you like the hassle. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, but it's nice to have a choice.

If you play enough at Main Street you'll get comped here at 777, so even better, your beers and meal will be free-e-e-e-e!!!! So hit the tables and the machines next time you are here and then grub down on some great food!!!",BLg3S6pZYKtEC448xuC2DQ,3,3,5,E3OIjSPqxwKcsF03sGjFxw

The portions are large. Fries were ordered for the table. They were delicious, both the sweet potato and regular fries were golden, crispy and hot. I tasted someone's onion rings which were very good. 

One of the dipping sauces served with the fries was a sweet sauce that is a cross between BBQ sauce and ketchup. It was the best part of my meal! Some in our party ordered cups of chili. Their cup size is very large.

I ordered the fish tacos. Big mistake!  The fish was on a nondescript, limp flour tortilla, on a few pieces of shredded, wilted lettuce. I wonder who told the chef that wasabi should go on fish tacos? The fish, although battered and fried adequately, was unseasoned. I thought maybe they didn't season it because it was on a fish taco so I tried someone's fish from their fish and chips order. That fish was also unseasoned and tasteless. 

Also the staff seemed to be having problems taking our orders in a timely manner. There were 8 in our party and it was a bit difficult flagging down waitresses and getting our drinks. They weren't even very busy that day. Prices are reasonable.",Z_zSqGECvZVrFr2QheoYYQ,2,0,2,6vKJXNEdGrro2Uhyk72Krg

Triple 7 Brewery is located in Main Street Station Casino in Downtown Vegas. It was a nice chance to visit that area again. Much more going on then I remember in years past. We sampled their:

Royal Red Lager
Marker Pale Ale
High Roller Gold
Blackchip Porter
Brewers Special...I believe was a Pumpkin Spice Ale

The names were cute, first brewery to really have vegas or gambling names, which surprised us. The beers were good...seemed like they tried to make lots of different styles including a Belgian quadruple, which we didn't get to try.

5229796,2011-12-07,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"As my mother was staying at the Main Street Station, I decided to visit her after I dropped off my bags (from Hawaii), and try out the Triple Seven Microbrewery. I already had my order planned and ready before I arrived.

Guacamole Burger with Sweet Potato Fries- 3.5-stars- I ordered this one cooked to medium. At first, I couldn't find the guacamole, but it was under the cheese packed in tight. So it wasn't as gooey or squishy as I had first anticipated. The burger itself was quite juicy, and had a hint of salt which stood out. There is also a lot of olives between the meat and cheese as well. Between the tomato and lettuce was some surprisingly fresh red onions--it definitely hits you fast. I'm usually a fan of caramelized onions on my burgers. The sweet potato fries were average, yet crispy and delicious, as fries should be.

Crab and Artichoke Dip- 3.5-stars- The crab flavor hits immediately, and you can tell this is soaked with crab. The amount of oil was a bit off-putting for me, since it made me feel sluggish and tired. Little balls I thought were potatoes, my mother confirmed was indeed artichoke hearts. This is served with tortilla chips and flat bread. I would go with the bread to slather on the dip. Otherwise, your chips will crack under the hefty weight!

Loco Moco- 3-stars- I ended my trip the way I started, at the Triple Seven Microbrewery, as I waited for our shuttle to arrive. I ordered it medium rare, as I like to have some blood in the morning--I also hear, I sparkle in the sunlight. Either way, this one comes with a thick brown gravy, which seemed a good fit, but the flavor was overpowering. A mix of salty and robust, it overwhelmed the other ingredients. The egg, I ordered sunny-side-up. The burger was just a burger at this rate. Served hot enough, my tongue was a little singed for a day. The plate was definitely filling, but not too exciting over-all.

Blackchip Porter- 4.5-stars- I'm a lover of dark beers. I love the deep woodsy flavor which washes around in your mouth. This porter also has an earthy, chocolate flavor when you drink it. Served with a thick lather of froth on top. Definitely a beer worth trying.

Atmosphere- They really keep the look of the train station here. Huge glass windows show off their giant microbrewery, housing all their different beers. The wide open-space takes away from the look of a bar, which would be great for a place like this, and makes way for an almost family dining environment. Tons of tables and seats, rarely filled--since the next-door Garden Court attracts the big eaters. There is a lot which could be done with this place, and it's not out of reach either.

Service- Service is decently fast, with a touch of Aloha--since this is a very local hotel the way it's run. The meals were delivered quickly, and there are television screens all around to watch the games and sports-reels.

Conclusion- A good place when you're not feeling the buffet. The hours are pretty generous from 11 a.m. to 7 a.m., definitely a place to stop when you want a drink and something to eat after long hours of 20x odds on craps, slots, or blackjack tables. Also, it's so close to the wifi zone, you can get good reception while you eat and drink. The Downtown area of Vegas has a different feel to it, and this place fits right in.",NMOoQ0FTn2NlJylSxSVseA,0,0,4,y4bG3nYWw9y8pFeLVImosg
5231960,2011-04-04,1,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"Dining out downtown can be very hit or miss. If you're not in the mood for steaks or deep fried twinkies, this is probably your best bet! 

I came during happy hour and found the drink prices to be a steal ($2 for wine, well drinks, or a pint of their microbrewed stuff). The food stuff on happy hour is pretty weak. Most things are literally .50 off their regular price, and some only .25 off ! 

I tried the black cherry stout on my last visit . I adore fruit beers that are subtle and this one was awesome. Just that perfect amount of black cherry.. yumm! I paired my beer with some happy hour wings ($4.50), and found them to be just OK. I guess 12 wings for $4.50 is a decent price, but the wings weren't anything special. My friends got burgers and seemed relatively happy with them, but again, nothing special. 

I think what this place lacks in quality they at least make up for in variety. Everything from sushi to pizza to meatloaf... no wonder all the food is just mediocre!! 

I hate to say it, but if I had to compare this place to BJ's, I'd have to give BJ's the win. The food is better and the service is far better. That being said, when friends want to meet up for a dinner downtown, this is one of my favorite spots.

It's my home bar away from home. It's so great here, I wished I live closer. I have been coming here about once every 4-6 months for the last ten years.  Here is why.

Come here for happy hour. I believe it's weekdays from 3-6. I was lucky enough to make it down here despite the weekend traffic and stopping by Mirage for a quick conference this past Friday. Once here, if you were by yourself like I was, you will be fortunate enough to just hop to the bar, watch the NBA playoffs on the flat screens, have a beer in hand, and converse with the locals.

What do you order here during happy hour? 

THE BREWMASTER SPECIAL.-I had a porter this time, which I might add, is something I usually do not drink. Folks, it was only $2 for a 16 oz. of handcrafter goodness and it was sweet and easy going down. Yes, I had more than one and note, you cannot get this flavor at the tables while you're playing.  I usually get the pale ale here, that is my favorite! 

An order of hotwings-These aren't the best I've had but it's pretty damn good for sharing or if you're a pig like me, just eat it yourself and it'll set you back only $4.25. 

An order of oysters-They are your normal oysters, nothing too special, though they are sweet and it is cleaned through well. 6 pcs are only $7.50. Comes with the cocktail sauce and horseradish. 

These prices reflect only during happy hour. I have to say, this past Friday, I was really happy in less than an hour.",GaTWkVy-pY6phZOqW6ykuw,13,13,5,pM36JcvyNG1b3lJrrOG-Hw

Triple 7 has one of the best happy hours. Monday-Friday, 3-6, with the exception of Monday Night Football and holidays. $2 is the price for their house wine, well drinks, and house-made brews. Most importantly this encompasses said mango hef. It is nice to walk into a place during happy hour and not have to fit for a seat in a small section to take advantage of the special. No, Triple 7 let's the whole restaurant partake in this goodness. They have a limited HH food menu that consists of quesadillas, wings, calamari, and maybe two other items for 4.50. We ended up splitting an order of the calamari. The squid were lightly battered and flash fried. The tenderness of the meat is not toughened in the process and still came out crispy. Served with a side of spicy marinara and lemon wedges, it is a nice snack while drinking. Just not the best choice with the mango brew. My sister and I learned our lesson. Good on their own, bad in tandem.

Mind you, the beer here is strong, but incredibly good.  I had one of their blueberry based beers, and it was like drinking a dessert.  Their microbrewery is huge, and is housed in an even larger room.  The layout is very, very classy, and best of all, no smoking, so I was able to enjoy my drinks even more.

The real winner for me was the crab and artichoke dip served with chips and garlic bread.  I'm a fan of both seafood AND dips, and this particular combination had me scraping the bowl for every last attainable morsel. 

The service was also great.  The guy was on top of things, never obtrusive, but always around for a refill.  And when I looked at my final tab, the price was ridiculously cheap for what I ordered.  Quality foodstuffs for a really workable price.

Make no mistake, I was pretty comfortable by the time I strolled out of the place.  The beverages kicked in as we were leaving, and honestly, it was more the relaxed buzz variety than the staggering out, ""please hold me up"" type.  I attest that to the overall quality and flavor of the drinks.

I don't hear a lot of people talking about this place, and I don't know why.  It's certainly something to check out while adventuring on Fremont Street.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,5,3,4,tgJf7IIM2zTR-1stc7CPxQ

For one, it's not out on the main strip and is hidden inside of the California so you don't get the riff-raff of casual Las Vegas street goers looking for a bar. People that come here seem to mostly be local residents and patrons of the California and Main Street hotels.

Two, the last time I came, there was a COFFEE infused beer and I love coffee to no ends. It was amazing while my drink was cold and first came from the tap, however unfortunately as the night went on, it got less tasty and grosser to drink. I know it's not normal for beer but I wish it had come in a smaller glass to keep the drink fresh so when I wanted more, I could get a fresh batch faster.",6nXgmi-9TBBEVEyTKEeIsQ,3,1,4,dSGucjNP17Om2jw-AfJgNA

All good because I was a fan of the taste more so than the knock you on your butt effect.

We came here on a recommendation from a friend, and was one of the reasons we came downtown in the first place. 

We started with the fried mushrooms that were tasty and PLENTIFUL, at a great price. When we found out the soup was New England clam chowder, my husband HAD to order it for the sheer curiosity factor of how they would do clam chowder in the desert. The answer: Not well. There were carrots?? in it, and it was so thin. The taste wasn't bad, but   doesn't get the Bostonian seal of approval.

My husband had the fish and chips which were HUGE, and the cole slaw was actually really tasty. He said the fish was great, not greasy or heavy. I had a cheeseburger, and it was solid. I had onion rings with it, and they were solid but a little too much breading.

I had the Hefeweizen and it was AWESOME, and a huge glass was less than 4 bucks. My husband liked his choice as well.

5622447,2014-03-19,1,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"There aren't a lot of places I would put down in Las Vegas as having a ""home"" or ""community"" feel. Though Sin City might indeed be the creator of many sinful provocations and temptations, ""humble"" isn't a word that comes to mind readily. However, visiting the little brother of The Strip and spending time in Downtown Las Vegas had the benefit of finding a nook, a corner to sit in where the smoke of cigarettes and waves of slot machines faded to a hum. Brick walls and copper colored beer vats instead took place and slowly, it's easy to phase into a history mixed with old speakeasies and modern day breweries like BJ's. Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery welcomed everyone back to the brewing days.

Deco: 4 stars

The interior is surprisingly large. Although located inside Main Street Casino, walking in felt like you were inside one half of a giant brewery, waiting to be explored like an adult in Willy Wonka's beer factory. Large copper vats can be seen and old saloon ceiling fans churned the atmosphere. Flat screen TVs showcased the latest in sports and a huge open dining floor with no partitions to be seen showcased the large space available for accommodation. There is no glitz and glamour of a showgirl here. Simply the girl-next-door humble look we all learn to love one day at a time.

Service: 3 stars

The service was friendly, almost down right Southern. The server was pleasant, introducing the different specials of the day as well as the selection of beers that are brewed within the very walls you find yourself. However, as tantalizing as the descriptions for food and drink might have been, it was a bit slow. Hopefully you are in no hurry.

Food & Drink: 4 stars

The great thing about a simple place is they give you simple, delicious food in large quantity. Sure, this isn't Bouchon or Mesa Grill but it doesn't have to be. There is no need for comparison because the food tastes great for what it is: traditional American cuisine made with good ingredients and lots of generosity in portion sizes. The burgers are juicy with crunchy, savory breads. The fries are crisp with a texture perfect for sauces. The salads are huge and filling for vegetarian and omnivores alike. Come hungry and you'll leave full. Come famished and you'll leave satisfied.

And because they brew and create their own hoppy libations on site, you as a diner have the pleasure to sample and indulge on truly unique beers you can only find here. The porter was delicious with that oaky, smokey, caramel aftertaste after each sip. The amber ale was as golden as a Swede's hair in summer. Plus like every brewery, there are flights to be had and spirits to enjoy. If for nothing else, you should come for the beer.

Price: 4 stars

The price might not be the cheapest in the land, hovering around the same price you would pay at a Hoff's Hut or BJ's, but you get so much for your money. It never feels like you've been cheated out of your money or you made a gamble by coming here, which is a great feeling considering all the dangerous that your wallet will face before or after dining here. Instead, just like the food, you feel satisfied.

Conclusion

Many people won't know about this wonderful brewery. Even more people will find it hard to believe you. But once you come here and truly experience what a gem this place really is, you'll be wondering why you never came before. From the artisan beers to the tranquility within the storm of chaos all around, Triple 7 Restaurant is truly unique and worth experiencing. You'll make a lot of bad choices during your stay in Sin City. You should at least try to make a good one by dining here.",ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg,2,1,4,PIKSdNuxxPKXQ5QHe21aBQ

Once again, I checked the bill like last visit and was charged for an extra mule, easy fix but like I mentioned in the last review, check your check and make sure everything adds up before paying. 

Better experience and food this time so I'm glad I was able to try them again.",dTW_kKKAKyX2fgaYhNtTQA,0,0,4,n6jXKNudlVz-36l53rDuTA

The food was good and the atmosphere was nice. The waitress seemed alittle distracted with her tables, took a few to get drinks refilled and when we needed something else she was not around, I guess she seemed too busy to wait on us. That is really the only complaint. The food was good and prepared well. I would go here again and try their other foods and drinks too.",KCD6daAp293FoOUoTjT_YA,0,0,4,_kAKhngf6Yoc14bKUOWpPg
5795848,2009-06-22,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"I'm a huge fan of this place.  Bang for your buck, hands-down one of the best places in Vegas.  It's a place that when it comes to comfort foods, there is no better place.  Buffalo wings are the best I've had in Vegas.  The cheesy garlic bread is unlike anything you've ever had anywhere else.  It's a meal in itself.  Great way to start.  The fried calamari serving is huge.  Just put some lemon on that and you're all set.

As far as entrees.  Their Beer-Battered Jumbo Shrimp looked like pieces of fried chicken on my plate...HUGE and delicious!  Burgers are always made just perfect.  Nice size as well.  The pizza and pizza crust is great, but stay away from the 4 cheese pizza ONLY because it has WAY too much cheese.  If you're into that, then it might be pure ecstasy.  I honestly can't say that this place has too many misses.  

If you go after midnight, they have a special on all their own brews.  My favorite is the High Roller Gold.  It's $1.50 for a 16oz. glass.  Well worth it.    I promise you will NOT walk out of this place disappointed.  Enjoy",FH3GgmOeAgXST37jG1-uWg,0,0,4,_Q9lOyMbeVBSXJIHMO26vg

My lover boy and I decided to order an appetizer and two meals to share. 

Hot crab and artichoke dip...a yummy appetizer that is so rich smooth and creamy! Ir comes with tortilla chips and garlic bread slices for dipping, this is a winner!

BBQ chicken pizza, very good! Mmmm sliced purple onion, cilantro and smoked Gouda cheese with a nice sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. 

Brewmaster's Tekka maki sushi roll, mmm yum! Ahi roll in beer batter, deep fried, comes with a nice teriyaki dipping sauce and wasabi.

5871636,2015-10-24,0,YZGSNhgTS6YeyUYoivD-Ww,"Service is always good here. During football days it gets quite busy so be ready for a 10-15 min wait for seating & don't expect your food to get to you quickly. However if you are ok with sitting at the bar you don't have to wait & can still order from the regular menu.

Food quality is pretty good. Ahi salad is a nice, light option if you don't want to feel stuffed. The Mediterranean chicken Salad is one of my favorites. Light, tasty & just the right amount of tartness in the dressing. My boyfriend loves their burgers, all of them. Burger fans should give it a try. Can't go wrong with the Flat bread pizzas & regular pizzas. Crust is thin & crunchy, perfect pairing with beer.

They offer take out orders but be aware that they charge a $2 service fee & the order must be placed at the restaurant; no phone orders.

Last tip, if you are a Boyd Rewards member & have a ton of points on your card, you can use the points to pay for your meals here! Just ask your server to check. If you use points they don't charge tax, either. It's a nice feeling to be fed for free after dropping too much money in the casino, haha.",raFyVr7n3DtJ0oRG3H244A,0,0,4,C1bAyLSBuvf4k29GP0QWXQ

have always eaten here multiple days during visits. our latest trip brought us here for dinner. The dinner special was a seared ahi salad for $12.95. Now by vegas standards $12.95 means something extraordinary. What we got was an iceberg lettuce salad with an overpowering asian vinegar dressing. Top it of with a medium rare ahi with strings in the middle!!!!! totally unacceptable. I've never had a bad meal here for years until this past week.
so sad..once my favorite place drops to the bottom of the list. dared not try to order the sashimi and sushi for fear of more poor quality.

I've only had appetizers here; the nachos were awesome but I was really disappointed in the deep fried mushrooms. They tasted like dirt so I know they weren't rinsed well. 

The customer service wasn't bad and watching the Giants win the World Series made my experience at Triple 7 even sweeter. It's a good place for groups and I'd consider returning if I'm looking for a few drinks and bar food at a great price. Most appetizers were an average of $8.

I thought it was interesting that there was a sushi bar in a section of the brewpub. I guess Main Street Station is trying to make the most use of its space.
