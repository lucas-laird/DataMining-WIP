The gentleman working the counter was extremely rude, snapped at me stating that I could not order a grilled sandwich because it was after 8:30.   I still ordered, but had to settle for something I really didn't want. 

I was at another location today and they appologized saying that is not true, you can order grilled sandwhiches up until closing.

Needless to say, I will not go back to this location.",xn5SYLEc-7wWAvRBsP9Ssg,0,0,1,OiLvj9ysWlX36ULnAo_FMg

A woman came in from the back ( smelled of strong cigarette smoke) and had been talking to a man for a few minutes in lobby area who left shortly, the wonan quickly started to yell at the new worker in front of everyone and telling him to work faster and that he can't be so slow. The new man ( employee)  tried to hurry as fast as he could but she continued to raise her voice and harrass him. All customers were shocked as no one was complaining of his service. The customer he was helping at the time tried to explain to the woman in charge that she had asked him to make her sandwich perfectly and that he wasn't slow at all. The woman in charge cut her off rudely and raised her voice to tell the customer that the man she was talking to was corporate and the new employee needs to work faster. The customer then asked for a number or comment card so that she and other customers in establishment could let corporate know that the new employee was doing a great job. The woman refused her request . The new employee continued to try to make woman in charge happy and he said nothing. There was another man working behind counter that never said a word ( he appeared to be embarrassed and scared ti say anything). This was the worst experience and I can't believe anyone would stay employed there! He would have been treated better begging for money on the freeway entrance!  I called port of sub corporate office 3 times to inform area supervisor or any other above this location on N Rainbow and Cheyenne, and not one person would return my call after i left messages to please contact me. I will never eat in their establishments and I will make sure to share this rediculious experience with everyone I know!!! SHAME ON YOU ....subway is better anyway and I hope that poor employee sues your company for harrassment",hSycQy4Xm7gA9XebC7ed-g,0,0,1,JYcSaWHRtZHz6VcuzhP1jg

1872639,2017-06-07,0,YnYS1dISBoLpA_VUSjOzEQ,"Ok...why the 1 star for a sub shop? Well...the list could be quite long for this location and the others I have visited, i think 2 or 3 more and I have had some brought back to me or went to a party and the trays were sitting on the counter and I was forced to eat it or enjoy chips and water...so this one location will get my review since I have been here I think 2 times (not by choice) and I will leave it at that.

First off, walking in to this spot feels like you are walking into a business that is actually about to close. Presentation should be key with a sub shop place, and this location is way out of whack. 

Walking in I was interested in seeing how they stand up against Sub shops like Subway or Jersey Mikes and this place didn't even get on the same page as those 2 chains.

I don't want to drag this on. The overall quality of the subs are bottom of the barrel, with horrible portion controlling at pretty high prices for what they are offering. The meat was nothing spectacular at all. Extremely basic, honestly I don't want to carry on with this chain.

I don't call this place Port of Subs, I call it Port of Shits, because that is exactly what it is. This company is making money and I have no idea how or what the guest are enjoying with these subs. Maybe I am missing something or just am use to a freshness and flavorful sandwich at the competitors location..

I will never buy a sub @ this location or any ever again.",Px6w_kTNBuy0GceThHnccw,0,0,1,JpnxRX9dMtwkHanpaH2lTA

I had the #13 salad style with spinach and my friend had the chicken salad. The place is clean and the food is always delicious. I don't know why people waste their time going to subway.  Tennessee is an asset to the company she is fast, friendly and polite with a great attitude. If you are their ask her to make your sandwich or salad it will be worth it.

Employees are always friendly and efficient, but today I went to get a sandwich for my boyfriend on his lunch break at 10:30 and the store was closed. The store hours say this location is open at 10.

2436089,2016-05-20,0,YnYS1dISBoLpA_VUSjOzEQ,"DIRTY! DIRTY! DIRTY! Every time I come to this port of subs it's a little worse every time. Let me start by saying that your staff is actually very nice. They were trying to move the line as quickly as possible and they apologized for the wait. They were all working hard to get to the customers.
I'm going to say that the problem here is the management. Every time I come in here there is always new people. I couldn't even finish my sand which because as I waited in line I noticed all the dirt. The whole place is dirty, dust everywhere. The ovens have a ton of dust bunnies which with the AC in here I'm sure fly into the food. The edges of where you keep the Coke are also full of dust and dirty. 
The final straw for me was when I saw a dead cockroach on the floor. On top of that your floors are also black like they haven't been moped in a while. 
I hope this review doesn't fall on the staff rather than the actual problem which is management & upper management. You can't expect people to do a good job with out the good training and tools!

To the staff working on 05/20/2016 around 1:30 you guys did a great job. I noticed your hard work. I hope you get the training and tools you need to succeed. 
Thank you for your customer service. I'm sorry that your management has failed you.",z0MLuGcYk8olNQ7TC5LUDA,0,0,1,NTkYas7jJMiL1keb7bmB7A
2764394,2017-05-15,0,YnYS1dISBoLpA_VUSjOzEQ,New peeople there dont seem to make sandwiches as im used to. Meat slices thicker like subways and sandwhich was super thin. I would rather give 3 stars but I know if I had a different person I wouldve gotten the service i was used to. The woman said she was the manager but totally made my sandwhich based on how She wanted not how I wanted it.  I will drive down to the Charleston and rainbow location from now on where the owners work out of.

3437269,2017-10-15,0,YnYS1dISBoLpA_VUSjOzEQ,"This Port of Subs was the worst ever. The guy name Chris (Zelda hat) was extremely rude. He was giving dirty looks to me for no reason. When I question him because it kept going on for a while he said what you can't read the sign. I said the yes the sign said reframe talking on your phone when ordering. I was on a phone listening to music for two hours waiting to talk to the insurance company so they approve my daughter procedure.
I said I'm not talking on the phone at all. I ordered my food he then was still giving me dirty looks and talking s*** to the manger and they were laughing. So my daughter said mom we don't need to spend our money here we will go to another port of sub. I then asked if I can speak to the manger he pointed to the lady said she the manger ( the one he was laughing with)  I said excuse me are you the manger she said yea I said so why would you sit there and let your employee talk to your customer like this. She didn't say anything, so I asked her what's her boss # she said we are a franchise and not corporate, I said ok that's fine you don't own the business what's his information. While Chris is in the back talking s*** I'm not paying him any mind. He said something to my daughter she 16 then my daughter said I'm going to need you to stop disrespecting my mom. He said no and continued to talk s***. While the manger just sat there doing nothing. So my daughter said something back to him and she said back to her and I told him he was a very ignorant person. Then I asked again for info to whom I can speak to. And the manger said Chris give her the # he said NO! Then he said I don't know Were it is she then told him. He talked s*** while writing it down. Then tossed it on the counter were other customer was standing. My daughter said you need to give that to her he said no I don't. While he was talking s**** to my 16 year old daughter I asked the manger can she please hand it to me. (A few times) she finally said you have to wait till I'm finished. Then Chris said he was calling security I told him that would be fine as I waited for the security she pulled up me still on hold on the phone. I told her the whole story and she said that she didn't understand why he would treat abut like that. We left I called Corp port of subs and waiting on a return call.

We ordered our sandwiches and i watched in disbelief as this guy sliced away.  We ordered medium #7 on white with double provolone.  The cheese was so thin i could see through it.  The double cheese wasn't even the amount of the regular cheese.  The older black woman that came from the back seemed put out that she had to come and help this guy make the food.  She rang us up and then we sat down to eat.  After about 10 minutes she came over to tell us that she didn't ring us up for the extra cheese... my sister pointed at the lack of ""extra cheese"" on the sandwich and she just stared at us.  She said it was $2.75.  She went to the register and came back with a quarter and no receipt.  My sister had to go up to the register and ask for the points for the $2.75 she asked for.  . .

I had the worst experience here a couple months ago & I promised to never come back. But did! Same result!!!!! 

I waited in line for 45 minutes..

Finally got up to the cashier, whom had been incredibly busy ignoring me for his phone. I asked him if he was going to ring me up or if I should come back.

Again, ignored. Everyone there was flustered. People started walking out of the store & so I stayed because they obviously weren't getting much money with the shitty attitudes. 

After then speaking up, he yells to me: ""cash or card? because our machine is broken!!!"" I lost it. I left so fast. So did everyone else! This is infact the worst place to go. I tell everyone to stay far away from this disgusting business. 

Their meat wasn't up to par the turkey they put on my sandwich was slimy & had spots all over it! Expired? Low standards, cmon now!

Though, there was one person who tried to help me, a tiny Asian girl. Whom seemed new & in guidance of the veterans there who didn't appreciate her one bit.  

I have hope for you, tiny Asian girl.

4142748,2014-01-12,4,YnYS1dISBoLpA_VUSjOzEQ,"This is an ok Port of Subs location.  My hubby loves Port of Subs, so we eat at them regularly all over town, whenever he gets the craving.  Some are yucky, some fantastic, but this location is right down the middle.  The staff at this location are very hit and miss.  Some are friendly and welcoming and some seem bothered you are making them work.  The store is clean and usually very well kept.  

I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!

My hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!

I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at that other chain sub shop.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.
