At Yui, I was introduced to a way of life I feel that not only has history but also a strive for excellence. As a second generation sushi chef, the owner gave us bits of his story very candidly and a window into a collage of his past. To say we felt transported to a small family establishment in the outskirts of Tokyo would be a grave understatement. The fish for the sushi at Yui is flown in daily. ""If no fish arrives, we don't open."" In addition, the atmosphere is further solidified by the large sushi bar carved from a 650 year old Japanese Cyprus tree, raw with no finish and in one large piece I believe it was 22 feet long. The tables, also raw wood and carved from the same Cyprus wood. Minimal decor and very clean, the ambiance inside Yui is luxurious, eclectic as well as inviting. The menu is simple, after described briefly to us, and we went with the 8 course meal. Here is where I could go on forever as I will forever be impressed with my experience, however, this is Yelp and I will try to simplify my remarks to some extent. First course was a homemade strawberry Sake that soothed the palette in preparation for the delights to come. The sake was a low alcohol, we were told 4% and made from organic strawberries. We also ordered nigiri, an unfiltered sake and I had the green tea service. I forget some of the order of the 8 courses but we had a soup, an appetizer which I will provide a photo of, a grilled plate, sashimi, sushi prepared in front of us with the freshest most delicious fish I have ever seen or tasted, a hand roll and dessert. The types of fish change daily I imagine to some extent, but I tried things that I have never even heard of before and a few exotics that I never imagined I would get the chance. Sea urchin and blowfish really stand out for mention here as well as a melty fatty tuna I believe it was called hamagachi toro, but please forgive me if this is wrong because I am writing from memory and did not photograph the menu for some silly reason( I never thought too). The service was more friendly and professional than I have ever experienced before and I have lived for and it worked in service my entire adult life. I can only describe the service as a vast cultural difference and must be experienced and applauded for its genuine nature. From the coat check to the final goodbyes Yui provides another world in our wonderfully diverse lifestyle that is Las Vegas, Nevada. Save up your money and make this a night to remember.

The service was extremely slow.  We had 5 courses, one of them only being a small shot of sake and this took 3 hours.  The food was mediocre.  Grilled items were either overcooked or still cold.  There was nothing special about the nigiri, not even the presentation and the fish did not seem that fresh.  We could not stand to wait another couple more hours to finish the omakase menu and just left.

To charge these prices the kitchen really needs to step it up on quality and presentation.

So after dropping $1000 on this meal I can truly say it's not worth it at all especially after having Kabuto a few days ago, It's night and day.  There really should be no comparison. 

Service was horrendous, not only did our server not clear our dishes at the sushi bar but also did not even refill our sake cups. Towards the end the server asked how was the meal my response was soso. And she went silent and walked away. Very disappointing. At this price point you would expect superb customer service and attention to detail. In japan this restaurant would be shamed on.  

Food is only mediocre. Rice was too warm and didn't have a good texture. Could even use more vinegar to the rice too. 
Fish was ok but very small pieces and only had about 9 pieces
The handroll at the end of the omakese was soft and not crispy. And even pointing out to the head chef and owner he did not even care and said it should be consumed within 5 seconds. So why we're the handrolls prepared in the kitchen and not by the sushi chef?
Only good food we had was cooked. So maybe this shouldn't be a sushi restaurant but rather a tappenyaki place instead. 

Decor and ambiance was ok but again lacked attention to detail. The place had tape on the wall right by the sushi bar, the curtain to the back kitchen was dirty (which is right by the bar) and the overall feel was cold.

House made lemon sake, SO GOOD. So many mind blowing fish we have not heard of, Japanese Kobe beef A11, sea urchin, oyster with house made ponzu, the list goes on. The restaurant is small and simple, we sat at the counter and our sushi chef was very professional, and explained many things about the fish and made the experience very enjoyable.  We got to watch him create everything we were making, and he cut each fish right in front of us which was amazing to watch and enjoy.  They give you the option to have additional pieces that you have ordered as well as a long list of other options you have not sampled.

I have been to sushi bars in a lot of different countries and a lot of different U.S. metro cities this one is a serious tourist trap. You would think with the prices so high that the sushi would taste fantastic and you would get at least two pieces but you only get one super tiny piece. The host at the front door was completely unprofessional when I walk through the door I asked if they had a sushi bar and she said yes and just sat there looking at me. I said do I need a reservation she then said no and proceeded to take me to the sushi bar. No return visits to this over priced extra tiny tapas sushi that does not taste that good at all (WARM). I have had better sushi at a few AYCE places and I try to avoid AYCE. Save your money go to any other sushi bar in the area.

We were in Vegas for a surprise birthday trip for one of my girlfriends and went to Yui on the last day hoping for a great meal and a great ending to our short weekend trip but I have to say this meal was quite disappointing. 

Food:

The appetizers and grilled foods were good. The sushi was just ok. We did get more premium selections such as wagyu and caviar. However, it's not worth the price. The hand roll at the end was especially bad since the seaweed was all soggy and we literally had to use our teeth to grind on the seaweed to take it apart. We went to Kabuto a couple of nights before and it was so much better tasting and better value for what you pay. 

Service:

This is the worst part of our experience. Considering the price point for this restaurant, I would expect some good service. Here comes another comparison to Kabuto. At Kabuto, I dropped one drop of soy sauce on my place mat and the waitress very quickly came over to wipe it off. Here at Yui, no reaction. 

After we finished the individual dishes, the utensils and plates were not cleared. At one point I had two sake glasses, two plates, a dipping plate, spoon and chopsticks all sitting on my place mat at the same time. Where was the waitress? I have no idea.

We ordered two bottles of sake. I think the waitress may have poured for us maybe once or twice. Rest of the time we had to pour ourselves because she was no where in sight.

We tried to show the head chef the poor quality of our hand roll. He took one look at it from where he was standing and completely brushed us off without even checking it himself.

At the end of the meal, the waitress routinely asked the birthday girl how was her meal. Her response was ""so so"". Any waitress at this point should be asking why? What did they do wrong and how can they improve. Nope, no response from her.

Most ridiculous part of all was after my husband signed for the bill and we walked out of the restaurant, the waitress chased after us and accused us of taking her pen. Her exact words were ""I saw you put my pen in your pocket!"". My husband had to empty out his pockets to show her that he did not take the pen but seriously? We spent that much on a meal so even if I wanted to take your $1 pen, you give it to me! That was just pure humiliation.

From start to finish, a beautiful dining experience of great food, exceptional service, and a demure ambience that has led me to rank Yui Edomae as my #1 sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.

As much as I appreciate the celebrity chef restaurants and the glamour of on-the-strip dining, it appears that I am finding the best meals off the strip in recent years. If you are willing to venture out beyond the neon lights, you'll run into foodie gems like Yui Sushi.

Similar to Kabuto (another off-strip sushi restaurant), you will find yourself at the mercy of the sushi chef as you select from a choice of several omakase courses.  The evening we were there, we had the option of choosing from 2 omakase dinner courses (Gen's Selection $160 and Omakase $120) and a Nigiri course $68.

The Gen's Selection and Omakase are both comprised of the same portion and course components: apertif sake, appetizer, soup, sashimi platter, grill platter, nigiri, hand roll, and dessert.  What differs between the two courses is that the Gen's Selection includes more expensive cuts of fish, choice ingredients, and includes Waygu beef in the sashimi and grill platter.

The Nigiri course consists of apertif sake, amuse, nigiri, hand roll, and dessert.  If you don't want to spend too much money and can do without all the frills of a course-style meal, I would opt for the Nigiri course and order additional a la carte sushi items if you're still in the mood for more.

Since it was our first time here and because we were celebrating a late Valentine's day, my husband and I both opted for the Gen's selection.  We sat at the bar in front of Chef Gen-san and watched as he and the other sushi chefs cut and prepared the sushi.  Every aspect of this course was exceptional from the refreshing sake apertif, to the grilled A5 Wagyu beef skewers, and even the melt-in-your-mouth cuts of otoro.  To a level that I would expect a Michelin star restaurant to be, I would feel confident in recommending this place to any sushi aficionado or foodie I know.  

There are about 10 seats at the bar, a few tables that seat 2 - 4 people, and a semi-private room for a larger group (about 5 or 6).  I would suggest reservations, especially if you want bar seating.",MspXtBLBkKJwEyfJ79YYJw,8,6,5,huQK-wVMB__nkYGUnAW2FQ

Ordered the Omakase $145/person
Pro: Quality of fish was good and a few selection offered I've never had before.
Con: Felt the what we paid didn't match what we ate for the omakase. The cooked course was grilled meats and seafood, which tasted overcooked to me. Some of the rarer fishes were on the a la carte menu which was charged at a premium between $7 - $9 per piece.

The food is unbelievably tasty. This restaurant shows what Edo Sushi is all about - a borderless cuisine that uses raw fish ( sushi ) with another foreign ingredient to complement the main ingredient. What a delightful way to enjoy sushi. 

 I have eaten at countless sushi places in many countries. This place's sushi rice is absolutely the best I have tried. Just the right temperature, softness, sweetness, and fragrance. It complements the fish excellently.  

You shouldn't come here for any of the following reasons:
1. Omakarssee meals start at US$160 per person. Plus drinks and tax and gratuity, you are easily looking at ~$250 per person. 
2. If you think all sushi are alike.

2338079,2016-10-02,7,LRpFWbovjUShlvCKQOS-Ng,"Ever since we discovered a local gem back at home, we've had a lot of trouble eating sushi at ""normal"" restaurants - my husband doesn't consider them authentic/traditional unless it's a real omakase experience.

While I was planning our Vegas trip, he wanted to bring our parents to somewhere fancy and show them what real omakase is all about. I did extensive research and found Kabuto & Yui. Unfortunately, Kabuto was already fully booked so we had to settle on Yui...but we weren't disheartened since the reviews on Yelp were so positive - the only downside was that we knew Yui would have cost us A LOT more for the same experience, so that only raised our expectations a lot more.

We arrived early for our reservation (we were the first party to arrive for dinner service, actually) and things already seemed a little disorganized. We had a private room set up, which was fine...although it kind of defeats the purpose of the sushi bar omakase experience.

Service was good in the beginning but somehow they got our orders wrong even though there were only 2 choices? The nigiri came unseasoned and they're the same for both the omakase and the normal nigiri menu...definitely not worth paying extra $50 - for that much more money, the selection should have been more premium with higher quality!

Plating could have been better and the flavor was underwhelming for what it's worth (but I will say that the fish was fresh). We were missing a hand roll and even though our waitress noticed, she ended up leaving the room and never returned with the missing order. We ended up having to flag someone else down to ask for it...seriously?? If you made a mistake, just own up to it and fix it - don't pretend it didn't happen and hope that we won't notice.

Also, their pace was WAY too slow - I understand that there should be a flow, but we basically had to rush them through dinner service in order to make it to our show on time (even though it was the second showing!).

Definitely not impressed and for charging me literally an arm & a leg that night, we will not be returning!",P6zpT_1VHl7lpzUlrq2Btw,11,3,2,z1OFWmSQ3GkDg2qUIy5_Mg

2468745,2017-03-25,12,LRpFWbovjUShlvCKQOS-Ng,"""The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart."" - Helen Keller 

A surreal experience fraught with beauty, Yui is one of the best experiences in Vegas! Chef Gen-San wowed patrons of Kabuto for years and has only stepped things up with his own spot. If Edomae sushi is what you're after, Yui is the best in town...and the best in most towns for that matter! 

My love took me here for my birthday last year and I was wonderfully pleased with the experience. The sushi is exceptional--full of premium fish and quality cuts. However, I would not recommend Yui if you don't love nigiri and regularly partake in omakase meals. Yui is not your entry level omakase spot. When you're the best edomae sushi place in town, AND you're using expensive product, you can charge as much as you see fit. Yui offers omakase meals at $120 & $160. For $160 you get a couple small tastes to start, a 5 piece Sashimi Course, a 5 piece Grilled Plate and several pieces of nigiri...I think 8 or 10...the portions were all relatively small, so I don't remember precisely as we added additional nigiri pieces to the end of our dinner. Yui is sensational, the food is amazing, the attention detail throughout the evening is precise, and it is in a clean, modern space that is simply and tastefully adorned. Yui is a place I would like to come to every year or two. I absolutely loved it! My only issue concerns the value. When my love offered to take me here a 2nd time or go to Kame, our other favorite omakase in town, I opted for Kame. It's not that I had issue with the notion that we would need to order additional nigiri in order to leave full...but the assumption was that at $160 per-person, omakase would be purely satisfying. Kame can't compare to the beauty of Yui's space, but it can in regards to premium product, and a lot more of it...so it depends on what you value more.

In the end, what sets Yui apart from other places is the harmony and balance of everything coming together...food, setting, service...and yes, even price. I'm certainly not suggesting that you aren't getting an experience worthy of this price. In fact, if the price was lower how would you ever be able to make a reservation? It is perfectly in line with what is being offered, namely, a remarkable meal.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,26,22,5,tKHA5WhAVPeftTecULHEQQ

We ordered the $210pp omakase, which started with a beautiful apertif champagne poured into a lit up iced bowl under a glass. Presentation was perfect!
Then followed the different courses. It was beautiful watching the chefs work their magic, and one presentation after another wow us.
Some favorite cuts:
- Oh toro: by far my most favorite, ended up ordering more. It literally just melts in your mouth, amazing!
- Uni: suuuuper fresh, just the right texture
- Shioko: first time having baby yellowtail, really good!
- Botan Ebi: ever so slightly sweet, chewy, delicious
- Ainame: texture and taste were both perfect
- Nodoguro: ordered by suggestion from chef. White fish, light and refreshing
Not so favorites:
- Awabi:came cooked, underwhelming
- Hotate: not as soft and buttery as I'm used to for scallops?
- Ikura: very basic
The grilled portion of the meal, felt the king crab leg was also underwhelming in flavor, as well as the shrimp head. The Wagyu beef was amazing though as was the snapper.
Also had a caviar with toro which was also amazing in the mixture of flavors.
Lastly, dessert was not too sweet, and a perfect way to end the meal. The ice cream comes with ground brown rice skin powdered on top - creative and delicious touch.

I'm not sure the meal was worth the amount it cost - extremely pricey, though good, not 100% was good. Also, at the end - server had issues splitting costs across a couple people's credit cards - kind of annoying way to end it!",A5ymNYLMb6ky0rCUKCdS-g,1,0,4,56pGSRNnQM20PQ82PoisOQ

From the moment you walk in,  the attention to detail is top notch and as good as you will find and with each course,  it was explained the order in which to eat and not only what it was but where from.  There are multiple levels of each course so you can do from $68 to $120(which we did) to $210 & + so you can get what you want.  The food quality is good especially the oyster which did not leave a watery taste behind like you get a lot of places and the handroll was perfect.

2. Décor/Atmosphere - Clean and simple. What's nice about this place is that they have more seating than other omakese places. They actually have a couple private rooms that can seat a decent amount of people. 

3. Food - F-in' fantastic. We went with the regular omakase, which set us back $120 per person. Here's what it came with:
     a. Appetizer Sake - House make, fruit sake. Light and refreshing. 
     b. Appetizer - Small dish consisting of Yams, small cucumber salad, and       steamed green beans. It was something small to hold us over until the main attractions began.
      c. Soup - Traditional mushroom soup in a light broth
      d. Sashimi - 5 cuts of super fresh sashimi. I managed to snap a picture, but forgot to note what I ate. I thought the cuts of sashimi was on the small side though.  
     e. Grilled Platter - Consisted of 3 types of fish and wagyu beef. This was one of the group favorites. Flaky Buttery fish with beef that literally melted in your mouth. 
      f. Nigiri - The sushi chef that was tending to us set plates in front of us at the sushi bar. As he made the sushi, he asked us to eat it as soon as he made it. I think we tried around 8-10 pieces of nigiri before this portion of was done. He also explained the rice that they use. They actually use brown rice, but they polish each grain of rice before cooking. It strips away the tough exterior, which is used to keep the moisture in the rice. The finished product looks like white rice, but the texture and consistency is out of this world. 
     g. Handroll - Simple tuna and Japanese green scallion hand roll. 
     h. Dessert - We each got a dessert. I went with the house made jelly, but I thought my dessert was the least interesting. Go with the brown rice ice cream. 

4. Service - Awesome service. We literally had a ex-ninja watching over us while we ate. There was never an emply plate or cup on our table for more than 3 seconds. They also took the time out to explain the food, history, and how to enjoy it. 

5. Bathroom - Standard bathroom. Nothing special. 

6. Price - Expensive, but well worth it. 

7. Baby Friendly - Probably want to leave the baby at home for this one. 

A lot of people compared this place to Kabuto (which is my other favorite omakese place). The thing is, half the staff from here Kabuto, including the head sushi chef. You'll find a lot of similarities between the two meals, but there's a little more variety here. Will be back!",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,5,2,5,v9KrPso2llyv_7gxZxZr8w

Taking the menu is a superb way to try a variety of items and you can also order a la carte in case the tasting menu doesn't have everything you want. The champagne that comes in a bowl with a light under the ice is fun.

I've been here 2x. Once while seated at the bar and another time at a table during a large group dinner. 

I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you have a chance. The experience is so much better and the food gets to you sooner.

Both times I got the $210 omakase. 

All of the menu items were impressive. There wasn't a single thing on the menu that I didn't like. 
The steamed egg was out of this world delicious. I've never had one that tasted like this elsewhere!
The owners pay so much attention to detail. For example. The rice is milled in house, they provide a certificate for the A5 wagyu they serve, their soy sauce is aged for 3 years, house made ponzu, fresh wasabi etc..

This is one of my favorite omakase in LV.",XOCyTfXy26xi4gZeun9v9w,5,6,5,brhv3mOLTcuLgRzu1MUJeQ
4939656,2015-11-22,2,LRpFWbovjUShlvCKQOS-Ng,"Alright, so you all know that I'm a big fan of Kabuto where I've been since their soft opening back in those BYOB days and I have not been to Kabuto in nearly two years as I moved out of town, then Gen-San left a few months after I left town. I have been patiently awaiting the opening of his own place as everyone else has and then I happen to see John Curtas' blog the week before coming back to town so I made the reservation right away.  So it happens that I already had a reservation for Kabuto and I ate there 2 days before, so I could compare them pretty much side by side.  

The location is as clandestine as that of kabutos, perhaps more so. However for those of us into shooting it's easy to find this place if you just mention that it is ""in front of American shooters entrance in the same parking lot""

The interior is just as serene and minimalistic as kabutos decor, with a large Japanese cypress counter top.  It was really good to see Gen-San again with his usual self. 

The menu was similar to that of kabutos with nigiri and omakase.  Fish choices were also similar with many white fish from Kyushu area.  They had Japanese blue fin from Nagasaki, which is a pretty rare thing to see stateside, in contrast to blue fin from Boston at Kabuto two days prior, instead of their usual farmed blue fin from Spain. 

I did the omakase and it's hard for me to compare this with omakase version of Kabuto since I did nigiri at Kabuto for the most part. Grilled stuff and sashimi were great however.  Their A5 wagyu was top notch. 

I don't think I need to elaborate much on nigiri: Superb as expected from Gen-San. One rare neta was cod milt (sperm).  I've had it a few times in Japan and it's a very seasonal winter ingredient but I was surprised that I could eat that stateside. Japanese blue fin o-toro and kamashita were outstanding. Blue fin from Boston I ate at Kabuto a couple days ago nor their usual blue fin from Spain cannot come anywhere close to it. 

I did get to eat both pear conpoté and anmitsu for desert.  I really liked the subtle flavors but Americans may prefer sweeter desert selections at Kabuto.

I though that the service was good, but one Japanese lady at Kabuto is so great and on top of things that it's hard to beat the service at Kabuto. I'm sure that things will improve with time. 

In summary, i felt that yui was everything I expected from Gen-San's new venture. He is planning to open a wagyu place in adjoining space and although that may be intriguing, I personally would rather have fish with Gen-San at the helm. It's another superb addition to the Vegas culinary scene.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,10,4,5,TOrLxINDc02gKGx3Bt_l8w

5094876,2016-05-28,18,LRpFWbovjUShlvCKQOS-Ng,"The Vegas sushi world is elevated once again.  Topping it all now sits Yui.

 Not AYCE.  No Cali rolls.  No yum yum anything.  No mountain of wasabi to be mixed with soy and drenching the nigiri.

Very important:  Understand this meal is $$$$ pricy by Vegas off Strip standards (double Kabuto and 6x your typical AYCE joint).
 
The brainchild of Gen Mizoguchi, former sushi master of Kabuto, Yui delivers a Kabuto like Edomae sushi experience on steroids.  The commitment to quality is impressive.  Rice is specially sourced from Japan and polished in house.  Flavorful, short grain, delicately seasoned, served at body temp with perfect compaction and no broken grains.  Seafood is almost exclusively sourced from Japan and air flown daily.  Freshness and quality clearly apparent.

 Omakase offers the best ingredients of the day.  Excellent progression of flavors and textures.  One difference, except for the nigiri (served in rapid succession and to be eaten as the chef seasons them), the remainder of the courses are served plated together.  Expect a wonderful selection of sashimi including a few slices of A5 Miyazaki wagyu gently pressed between blocks of Himalayan pink salt blocks for a mild salinity then served with a three year aged soy.  The grilled course includes, fattier items, including more of the wonderful A5, bincho (Japanese charcoal) grilled rare and served with a bit of miso offset by a grilled takenoko along side various seafood items.

The selection changes with availability.  Suffice it to say, standards like Otoro are properly graded, fatty and unctuous, the uchiwa ebi, toothsome and extremely sweet,  the lightly torched shirako (fish sperm), pillowy goodness that burst forth with oceanic creaminess, the Hokkaido uni, velvety and flavorful.

Note:  Carnivores, a full 4oz or 7oz Miyazaki A5 wagyu course is also offered.  The beef is grilled over bincho.  Market price will vary. On the night of this visit 4oz aprox $130, 7oz aprox $200).

The minimalistic decor focuses all attention on the chefs and the food.  

Just 10 seats at the sushi bar.  Reservations required.  Excellent service.

Nigiri omakase, $70.  Full omakase from $120 - $160 with all the upgrades.  Ala carte nigiri also available.

I've only cried a couple of times in my life of being overwhelmed with joy! The day I was born, the day I realized I met the love of my life, and the moment I had my first bite at this establishment. I have to say the omakase was at the right tempo and it was like art set into motion. It was so smooth and each course came at the proper time. Our waitress was very knowledgeable with each fish, and her recommendations were on point. For example, she recommend something that wasn't on the menu. I believe it was part of the fin on the tuna. I was a bit adventurous that night and gave it a shot and I must say it was one of best bites of the night. Who would of thought the fin was the best part of the fish? It was almost on par with the Otoro which literally melts in your mouth like hot butter. I have to say I've been scarred with this experience. I will never be able fully enjoy all you can eat or sub par sushi at other locations after enjoying such quality fish.

Heard about it recently from the lady and came here during the first week of their opening. Like Kabuto, Yui does not disappoint and hopefully will go even farther.

This is the only restaurant I've been to that has hagashi toro (fiber-less). 

The restaurant is very simple and feels very traditional Japanese. 6 seats at the bar, 6 seats in booths, and a private room that probably fits 10. Very small and very intimate. Loved our evening here.

By the way, the food is so good, that I can hardly find any sushi restaurant I want to dine in for the next couple weeks.

5979676,2016-04-28,3,LRpFWbovjUShlvCKQOS-Ng,"Having eaten sushi on a regular basis, this was by far much more superior than any other sushi I have had.  Both in rice quality and fish quality.  Can I say this is the world's best sushi, I am not sure.  However, watching the art of true experts prepare fish that is uniquely sources and extremely difficult to get was worth the experience alone.

My wife and I ordered the sushi only Omakase since we didn't really want the cooked foods to be selected for us.  Besides that I ordered the Wagyu skewer.  I ordered one, but due to a lack of English communication the server thought that we ordered one each.  I told her that and she looked befuddled.  Since this was the start of the meal and we were sitting at the sushi bar, I really did not want to bad buzz the meal so I accepted both, even though each was very pricey to begin with.

After a great round of sushi I ordered several other pieces which were not part of our line us.  I am glad I did.

Although I have no regrets and would be back, I did not feel warm and fuzzy about the $350 bill.  That is not to say that I have not had pricey meals before.  I gladly paid $400 for a solo meal at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon in LV.  But here, I didn't quite feel it was worth it.  Nonetheless the meal was extraordinary and I had no issues paying a premium for the experience as well as the food.

If you want a Japanese sushi experience and you are willing to spend some duckets, this place is definitely worth the try.
