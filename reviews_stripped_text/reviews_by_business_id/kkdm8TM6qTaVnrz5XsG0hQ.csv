Rating Summary::
- 4 Stars, For Vegas Standards: Yay, I'm A Fan
- 3 Stars, Compared to SoCal Kabob Houses (Zankou, Kabob Exp, Open Sesame): Just A-OK


I order 4 items and mixed it up a bit so we can try all the meats:
- Plate 1: Chicken Breast and Beef Tika Kabobs
- Plate 2: Chicken Breast and Kofta (ground beef) Kabobs
- Plate 3: Chicken Breast Kabobs, side dish
- Plate 4: Beef Gyro Wrap
- Sides: Salad and Bread

Summary of Plates Eaten: [see pictures]
- Plate 1: Chicken (too dry) Beef Tika (good taste, little chewy)
- Plate 2: Chicken (dry, bland) and Kofta (good taste)
- Plate 3: Chicken Breast, side dish (my boy liked it, finished it)
- Plate 4: Beef Gyro Wrap (my boy liked it, finished it)
- Sides: Salad (need to get used to the dressing) and Bread (good eats)

Did I forget the hummus and tahini? I'll ask about it next time.

We'll be back in October to give it another try and see if the meats are still cooked the same way. Hopefully the chicken shish kebabs will be a bit bigger with more seasoning so it won't be so dry and bland.

All the negative reviews always complain about customer service but never have I had issues and the reason being for this is because I am not picky and rude to the staff. If you come here, sit down, take your time, and enjoy your food as it should be then it will definitely be worth it. All the food is made from authentic family recipes and made fresh from full kosher (halal) meat. This restaurant is a hidden gem. My favourite recommended plate is the number 8 (chicken and beef sultani). The chicken is marinated in a delicious yogurt based marinara and the food is cooked over an open flame grill. Delicious. Another recommended plate is the chicken shawarma wrap with fries and a drink. 

If you love small genuine places to eat this is one. The manager and employees will remember you and they will become your second family.",Fy1ASW-F80S5pB7_jgTC5A,2,2,5,ezVSiIgFR3G9rAkHpBN9rg

305117,2014-01-20,0,kkdm8TM6qTaVnrz5XsG0hQ,"My mother and I stopped by kind of randomly searching for tacos and when we saw this place we both said at the same time... what about kabob? I turned the car around to go back.. (Sorry Mexican food, as much as I love a taco carts, middle eastern food wind hands down almost every time). 

The cashier and cook were bright eyed guys that seemed much smarter then their present positions. The cashier was very proud of and passionate about the food and the cultures it came from and had quite a lot of information to share about the word derivatives spellings pronunciation and history of the same foods in different regions of the middle east. We both found him welcoming and playful, not over serious about the information, just happy to share. he was explaining the language bases of Iran, Afghanistan, and Arab states talking about how Persian language is actually an Indo- European language with a barely modified Arabic alphabet and Arabic influence.. I never stopped to think it was closer perhaps to French then Arabic.

The food...pretty awesome. It was clean, well made, and delicious. My mother was particularly enamored with the rice. The only thing we didn't finish was the pita. it was nothing special and a little dry.

The menu was limited in terms of vegetables. This was my only real complaint. I guess its better to do something small and do it well but places with limited vegetables lowers the standard a little for me. I eat meat but don't always and am a much happier eater if there are lots of  veggies. Wile there were several options for kabob there were only sides of a grilled eggplant dish, a spinach dish, and a green salad and the same green salad with chicken on it as an entree. more veggies please!

The atmosphere was well lit and clean. There was some culture specific art on the walls from Afghanistan (remember  that haunting national geographic photo of the girl with the amazing eyes?) and Iran and there was a fair amount of seating and the tables and chairs were better then usual for a strip mall restaurant but you could still tell you were in a strip mall. We carried out because we were dressed poorly having stopped there after doing some construction in the house. I  was afraid I'd get  construction dust on the chairs if i sat down. And the other diners were dressed like  professional people, some button down shirts a few polo shirts and slacks.. so it was nice enough for me in my ripped and paint covered work clothes to feel well under-dressed. I'd say its classy for a strip mall but you still go to the counter and take your order and get served on a standard red restaurant tray.

Other customers were speaking in what sounded like the few farsi words i know. To have a place be frequented by people of the same culture is always a good sign.

I would definitely recommend this place and so would mom.",XSCf9uT3ZGKU-gF79UFTNQ,1,0,4,hosbrs4DO1dt8ZwFq4BmUQ

It's very clean and inviting on the inside. The men who run the cash register/cook here are friendly and work fast. 

The food is high quality and fresh. I ordered the combination plate with chicken and steak kabobs served on top of a heaping mound of rice. The meat was tender, moist, and hot off the grill. A small salad and diced cucumber/tomato is served on the side along with a thin, spicy,  green sauce which you can tame with their cooling tzatziki. 

I recommend ordering a side of the hummus. It's not grainy, stale, or bland like the hummus at other places.  It's blended smooth,  served with a sprinkle of paprika and drizzled with oil. You can actually taste fresh lemon and garbanzos. 

Light eaters will be able to split their plates into two portions.  Others won't leave hungry either. I will be returning to eat here soon!",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,5,4,5,9vz0Kj-AnhpGI0wKKXDBaA

The place is pretty small but very clean and the gentleman at the front was very welcoming.

Everything on the menu looked good but wanted to try a little bit of each of the meats. I decided on the meat combo which consisted of chicken, beef, and kefta. Each of the combo plates came with your choice of meat, rice, salad, and a pita bread. I wanted to go all protein so asked for the combo without rice but the cashier highly recommended the rice. You can certainly tell he was very passionate about his food and stood by it 100%. I also got a free soda with a yelp check in which I gave to my co-worker. Since I didn't order a drink for myself the cashier went ahead and offered me another free soda. Nice!!

As the food came out I noticed the portions were pretty big. The meats were very tender and the chicken was very moist. The beef to my surprise was so tender I was able to separate it with just my fork. My favorite was the Kefta. I believe its made with a combo of beef and lamb but the spices is what really makes it stand out. Oh and be carful because you'll get the garlic burps after eating the kefta. I didn't mind since I was able to taste it throughout the day, it was that good. Also ask for the cucumber yogurt sauce and the spicy green sauce as both go perfect with the meal. 

Overall this place fully satisfied my protein craving. I would definitely come back. Awesome kabobs.",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,3,2,4,A55Z4H-EKseJXgnAq1jtkg

All very good and earned a solid 4 stars until the metallic tasting hummus that came with the falafel dropped this foodieview down to 3 stars. It's common foodie knowledge that hummus has citrus juice in it, but don't store it in metal containers without first lining the container with a barrier between the contents and the metal. In any case it's a good practice to use a lining in all metal containers when using them with food. The metallic taste of the hummus had me wondering how long they've been serving that batch before making a fresh one. A&E Foodieviews plans on stopping by Kabob Express again because well made falafel is far and few between, and hopefully the guys in the kitchen will have some proper hummus ready to serve.",ql0mzE-9YVs42QIKgcemuw,0,0,3,dRHcNZQbyN_BXYP-KNdU6g

832285,2012-06-25,5,kkdm8TM6qTaVnrz5XsG0hQ,"The Kabob Express is in a satellite section of a Mall anchored by a Marketon Grocery Store. Right on the southeast corner of Tropicana Avenue at Eastern Avenue. It is an unassuming place in the middle of this small strip area at the front corner of the entire Mall.

Libby and I went in and looked at the menu items up on the wall. We ask the Fellow at the counter a question or two, made our decisions, ordered, and paid. We took some of the plasticware and filled out drink cups. We took a nice table with a view of the parking area and the intersection.

I ordered a Number 5, Lamb Kabob Dinner and Libby a Number 3, Chicken Breast Kabob. I do agree that it took a while for our order to arrive. The Chef cooked each order separately in a very hot kitchen area. Two families were already eating, one table of two was waiting and then us. The interior was clean, spacious, and cool. It didn't bother us to wait but, I believe that this Express is really a ""Local"".

Our food arrived. Mine was a full plate of seven pieced of wonderfully cooked lamb. Cooked and browned well on the outside and medium rare within. The pieces were about 1.5"" X 1.5 "". They were really nice sized chucks of juicy meat. There was also some romaine with a creamy dressing, seasoned rice, and a nice portion of tomato, onion, parsley salad that I usually call Israeli Salad. It was cold and flavorful.

Libby's chicken kabob dinner was just like mine with the exception of the chicken instead of lamb. The chicken pieces were a hair smaller than my lamb pieces. They were cooked nicely and had a yellow color that I believe was the addition of some turmeric to the chicken marinade. Her chicken was moist and done perfectly. The pita on each plate was about a 3"" size, warm, flavorful, and soaked up a lot of sauce.

I had asked for some Maast Wa Khfar which is yogurt and cumber sauce. It is known in Greek as Tzatziki Sauce. It was cold and had a fine flavor that went well with my Lamb. With our dinner cam a small plastic cup of a green vinegar sauce that was like fire. I am still trying to find out what is in it other than ""grated spices"". So, beware of this ""Green Dragon""  if you have a tender palate.

All in all this was a fine stop for us and a belly full of food for $20.00 bill. It was good enough that I ordered a pair of lamb kabobs and  container of the cucumber sauce to take home.

Give this place a try. the food is well worth it. Remember though, it is running on the ""local"" track and is definitely not an express train.

First thing you have to understand, this isn't a full restaurant, this is not like the hookah lounge; Kabob Express is a specialized place. I often compare this place as the in-and-out of the mediterranean world. In-and-out, only has a few things, but they are GREAT at what they do have, and they have KILLER Fast Food; compared to Mc.D, Wendy, Burger King, etc..etc.. In-n-out isn't as good as some of the high end burger places here in vegas ( if you want to spend 80 dollars a burger). However In-n-out is killer for great food fast. Well Kabob express is the same way, The wife and I went there last night, it was 21 dollars, and she had lamb ( yum) and I had a gyro. The food is fast, it is as good as home cooked, and we love it. We have been there 10+ times and never a problem. If you want really high end mediterranean or some place for a nice romantic dinner, this isn't the place to go. However if you want to sit down and eat some great food after shopping, or a day at work, go here and you will love it..",p_bo9y9kME2s9M4WroDnjw,0,0,5,Qgu3HWILPRG7qAZ5iGvXJQ

Well, the butthole at the counter met my expectations on the crap conversation.  Had an attitude with everyone he served.  Anyway, that's fine.  What's not fine is charging me extra for hummus and eggplant and not giving them to me.  I got takeout so it's my fault for not checking before leaving, right?  Wrong.  It's not my responsibility to check.  But from now on, I will.  Sick of getting shafted like that.  Anyway, won't be back.

I got the chicken and beef kabob plate and a gyro. The kabobs were both so tender and delicious and the gyro although it looked plain upon first seeing it, did not disappoint! Plenty of protein which is a big thing for me. I hate when they skimp on the meat and I eat mostly carbs and filler veggies. But they did not skimp on the meat. 
The employees were not the most friendly or welcoming upon entering the establishment, and even told us to hurry when giving us our food because they were closing which bothered me a little because that has never happened to me before and they had over 30 minutes before closing but the food was so delicious and priced extremely fairly so they still get that 5 star rating.

2157926,2017-02-12,1,kkdm8TM6qTaVnrz5XsG0hQ,"Tried this spot about four months ago because I love this type of food. I wasn't crazy about it but one of my coworkers insisted I give it another shot. 

Went again Friday and once again, wasn't wow'd. 

When I got there I ordered and found a place to sit. The table was dirty so I started wiping it down and the guy who took also had taken my order at the register came over and wiped it and apologized. He was telling us how he has several duties and just got behind. No big deal at all. He was super nice. 

They also have no public restrooms which was kinda unfortunate because I also didn't enjoy my food as much since I had to use the restroom. They do have a hand washing station in the main restaurant area for convenience. 

Most importantly- the food: My only negative about the food was that one of the pieces of chicken breast had a really strange consistency. I have experienced it before with chicken breast and I really can't explain it but it's unpleasant. The beef was very tasty and the rice and salad is good.

The prices are reasonable, the portion sizes are decent. $12.95 for the chicken and beef combo I usually go with. The slice of pita could be bigger in my opinion. Since it's so inexpensive, why not throw larger piece on the plate to fill us up a little more...

Overall I think the place is solid. If I'm in the area and really need something to eat I'd go back. But unfortunately it's not one of my top choices for this genre of food in the valley. 

I'd still say give it a try for yourself though.",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,4,0,3,Wi_ssr2wVkVmRLMqKN1-gg

2192005,2014-02-21,0,kkdm8TM6qTaVnrz5XsG0hQ,"Kabob Express makes the tastiest kabobs on the eastside.   After trying out several kabob places, I've always come back to Kabob Express for lunch or dinner.

Unlike the other kabob places, Kabob Express makes afghan style kabobs.  According to the owner, the meat is marinated for 24 hours to seal in the taste.   Other kabobs, like Persian, don't do the marination and thus requires that they be eaten with sauce (like tzaiziki).   I would have to agree.   Kabob Express' beef is tender and full of flavor.  The chicken is the best from all the places I've tried because it is moist and tasty; the chicken at other places tend to be very dry.

I recommend getting #8 Chicken Beef Sultani for $12.  At that price, it is a great deal because you get two kabobs, one beef (not ground) and one chicken, along with rice, lettuce salad, cucumber salad, and pita bread.  You get a huge ranch dressing and a little tzaiziki sauce.

Be aware that the kabobs are not 100% consistent in quality.   Sometimes, the beef is a little tough, instead of tender, or the meat is cooked too much (dry).   Most of the time, the meat is tender and cooked perfectly (still moist).   So try them at least two times.

Indoor seating is spacious, though with few tables.  Parking is plentiful in the plaza.",7E4iVTIsZJu8y_w4_JKg2g,1,0,5,kC-YLbKjNfcih3831GEuZQ

Okay, the kafta kabob plate here is my half-Palestinian half-Israeli son's go to meal. If he's screaming, whining, or even being super cute and we're east of Decatur, we're going to Kabob Express.

I sometimes order the Tandoori chicken, which is a hit or miss on being cooked properly, but the flavor is there and either way the rice is delicious. 

The shawarma here is not shawarma, you should know that ahead of time. The hummus is super Americanized and the pita is always dry/hard. 

My issue here comes with the guy who is apparently the weekday cook and even the owner. The weekday cook is rude and whistles while making the food - a very bad omen in the eastern end of the world. Regardless, it's plain old annoying in such a small place and when a customer, especially a regular, brings it up, the owner should do something about it. 

This is going to potentially sound racist here, but it might be smarter to hire people from the region of the cuisine you're making at your eatery rather than people you try to train who don't know what the flavors are supposed to be. 

Well, the 'front of house' staff is amazing and Kabob Express always makes my toddler happy, so, hey, it's an overall winner in our book.

Tip: Call 15 minutes before you get there so your order is ready to go.

I went there again today and once again the food was simply amazing!  The care that is taken to cook AFTER it is ordered.

This place did not disappoint. It was just a few minutes off the strip, excellent prices, good portions and delicious fresh food.

We did take out, but saw quite a few people dining indoors. We had the chicken tandoori kabob, chicken breast Kabob dinners and chicken shawarma sandwich. The food was ready in 10-15 minutes. They packed extra sauces (I especially liked the green sauce - it has a bit of a kick to it!), utensils and napkins. The man at the counter (Agha) greeted me warmly and had the order ready. 

The food - the kids ate it so quickly, I didn't even have a chance to take a picture! The dinners came with naan, rice, a generous portion of chicken and salad. The sauces were a good addition. The chicken wrap was pretty good too.

4131188,2012-05-31,4,kkdm8TM6qTaVnrz5XsG0hQ,"So a few years ago I went to a party and had these Kabobs, not like the ones you put on the grill with some onions and pepers some REAL  kabobs!  OMG these were so good they have been in the back of my mind thinking about them for years now.  I FOUND THEM they are around but searching yelp for someplace different on the way home I ran across this place.  Let me just say I'm a pretty happy girl.

I had a hard time deciding between the Gyro and the Kafta Kabob because like I said I had this at a party so I didn't know the name.  So I asked the front guy (I think he might have been one of he owners NICE guy) which he thought I should have, he said the Kafta kabob had more seasoning and flavor, who's going to argue with that, right?  So it comes with a small salad, a kind of pico salsa, lots of seasoned rice and a pita, Kabob oh and a mild hot sauce (very good).  The salad was fresh no icky pieces, nice.  A kind of pico salsa had a bite or two but didn't want to waste space for the main coarse.  The Pita was lightly buttered I believe with maybe a bit of garlic? not sure on that one but it was lightly grilled just slightly browned on the edges and oh so nice.  The rice Mmmm seasoned fresh long grain Mmmmm I took a bite with every bite of kabob so it left a lot less room for anything.  So onto the Kafta Kabobs Oh My this is a blend of beef and just a tiny bit of lamb for flavor a lot of people stay away form lamb because it is quite a strong flavor but you have to trust me on this one and try the blend it is light and adds so much to it, I loved it.  There is many others seasons but come on I'm not that good ;) 

Sooo years after my kabob experience I have found it, the one.  

The decor is nice it is mellow you can watch the variety of people walk by.  The wait wasn't bad it is a small restaurant btw so if its packed and you don't have time you might want to move on (waited 8 minutes) but if you want food that takes time to taste good then wait.

BTW again I had leftovers big portions and they have a yelp offer check in and get a free soft drink.

When I walked in, there were about 10-15 other customers eating in the small dining room. There was one Middle Eastern customer waiting to order in front of me, and then a few minutes later, another Middle Eastern customer was waiting behind me. Here is where I started to have a problem: Even though there were TWO men manning the cashier stand, neither of them knew what they were doing. They did not know how to take orders, how to make change, or how to talk with customers. 

Finally, after at least five minutes, it was my turn. However, the two men looked directly past me at the other customer BEHIND me and invited him to the cashier stand instead of me. I was very confused but continued to wait. After they took his order, they both pulled out their phones and started texting. I was pretty furious at this point so I marched up to the counter and asked if I could order. Both of the men seemed caught off guard that I would actually want to eat, but finally managed to take my order (amid much confusion over what I wanted, how to spell my name, and how to make change). I didn't even use my free drink from Yelp because I knew it would just waste more time because of all of the confusion. 

The only reason this review is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because my chicken tandori kabob with rice was SUPER good. I almost didn't want it to be good because I was so disgruntled, but it was amazing. Don't put much stock in their bread (it was a HARD piece of pita) or salad (a few lettuce pieces thrown in the corner of the to-go box), but the kabob and rice ALMOST makes me want to go back.

I was in the area and saw the check in offer. 

The place is pretty small and in a strip mall. You can't miss it though; the name is in 3 foot tall letters with a yellow background.

The décor was nice and not overdone.

The owner was there and was really nice and cordial. I asked him what he likes and he said the lamb kabob was one of his favorites. And the green sauce that comes with it is one of his house specialties.

The lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked nice and tender. I don't eat lamb the often and this was a really delicious treat! The sauce, wow, spicy but not too spicy. The kind that keeps you going back for more. 

Now let's talk about the rice. OMG, I honestly and not a huge fan of rice but this rice was deeeeliscious. it was long grain rice. I don't know what they put in it but damn. I ate all of it and would have eaten more if there was more on the plate until I was in a carb coma. I think they sprinkle the top with a mixture of cayenne and sumac.

To start, it was difficult to place the order because the manager was not available the first two times I called and no one else could take the order. Then, when I did place the order and told them we are tax exempt, he still quoted me a price with tax. Not realizing that he included tax, I told him it was a bit high compared to what I expected. He offered to give me a discount and brought the price down 10%. I was appreciative for that since we are a non-profit and have to keep our costs down. 
Well, when I arrived to pick up the order, I asked for a receipt showing what I paid for and they could not provide me with one because of the discount. During this discussion, I discovered that my 10% discount was applied to the total INCLUDING tax! So he really gave me a 2% discount since we don't pay tax to begin with. The man who was there (Surprise, the manager was not there again) was very nice and tried to help me. He called the manager on the phone so he could figure out how to give me the receipt I needed, but the manager was very rude. When I explained the situation and what I needed, he said he couldn't do it because the register doesn't allow him to. His best offer was to charge me full price so that I could have a receipt that matched the credit card slip. 
When I got the order back to the office and began serving to our clients, we were not pleased. The order was chicken breast kabobs, rice, salad, and pita bread. The chicken was dry, the salad was just chopped iceberg lettuce, and the pita was cold and some pieces were moldy. The only thing I can compliment them on is the flavor of the rice. 
They charged me for 30 individual meals, and fortunately, we had a few cancellations because they did not provide enough chicken to feed 30 people. I agreed to allow them to provide the food in catering trays rather than box up 30 meals, but all this allowed them to do was short us. 
This was not the first time we had ordered from them, but it will be the last after the treatment I received and the frustration of the whole experience.",NFJMg9B6JyHMrT4FLHv9bA,7,0,2,UO9JOp1J4bCCGfnKkr-zrQ

Beef Gyro - Standard pita stuffed with beef onion and tomato. Maybe they dont put lettuce so it wouldn't get soggy wrapped in the warm pita and hot beef. For $5 I would eat it again they definitely didn't skimp on the meat. Smother that bad boy in some of their yogurt sauce and it's bomb.com. 

Kofta Plate - ground beef seasoned yummily ( I just made that word up ! ) and made into almost sausage. Then it's grilled and served with rice , a salsa which is almost like pico de Gallo except it has cucumber and parsley instead of cilantro. Also comes with bread and Tzatziki sauce. 


Been meaning to try and take it off my bookmarks. So great success !",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,3,2,3,4KIWwMhSFxkSns8IcTMrFA

They also give you a generous amount of flavored rice and a small pita like bread.

I also ordered the hummus it was decent but wished they give you a little more bread to dip in. Overall I enjoyed the meal and would go again.
