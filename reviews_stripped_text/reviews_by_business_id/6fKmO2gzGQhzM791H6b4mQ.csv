Since relocating on the westcoast,ive decided to give it a go thinking things would be different. I ordered from the sahara location and was surprised. Pizza and service was great! Ive been hooked every since then. Even though sahara and the maryland parkway location is the same distance from me,i change my store  location to maryland. Things were different pizza was still good but boy they cant follow directions. I ordered a total of 5 times from this location ;to deliveries and 3 pick ups and each time they screwed my crust and did not give me square like i requested.why?i just dont understand!!!. On one occassion they got my pick up wrong, they said i have to bring the pizza back or receive a free pizza on my next visit. I decided to keep my screwed up order and get the free pizza because i was already to far away. While grocery shopping,idecided to pick up my free pizza. I ordered than picked up. When i got there and told the lady about my coupon thats under my phone number,she gave me an attitude as if i was lying..really weirdo..you gave me the damn coupon,(i remember her name...then get in the car to discover my order was WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We ordered a two pizzas, and I was watching their tracker system for it. 

It sat in the ""Quality Check"" area FOR 20 MINUETS! I KNEW when it arrived it would be cold.  An HOUR after I placed the order it got to my door, ice cold.  I gave it back to the driver, she didn't know what to make of the situation and left.  She also forgot my soda.
Wasted an hour of our night.

This is the worst store ever.  MAYBE every 1 in 7 times, it's good, but I get so frustrated that they can't be consistent.  I guess they are consistently bad.

Save your time and money, DO NOT order from this location.

I'm sick that it isn't run better, they need to have a DM come in or something and train them how to make a pizza and drive it in a car to a house while it's still hot.

ETA:  Might as well rant about the other failures I've had with this store.

Driver forgot our soda, had to go to 7-11 to get one for us.
Another time we got a 2 liter, it was room temp....gross.
Wrong pizza in the box with the right info on it.
Underdone crusts.
Hardly any cheese when it was supposed to be ""extra cheese""
Whole topping sliding off the pizza.

Later on it was me who finally chose we should settle down with Domino's. So we order top QUALITY Pizza fat has double the amount of cheese double the amount of pineapple I know but pineapple does belong on pizza. Not only that but with the three pizzas we ordered we decided for a little dessert. now once we finish this order and mind you it was 11:00 at night we place this order for this delicious top QUALITY Pizza and waited patiently for it to arrive. An hour goes by and the pizza has not yet arrived. The wait time was said to be 35 to 45 minutes but we didn't let this get our hopes down so we decided to call. As we called of course there was a little bit of waiting required but this was only acceptable for such a busy place. As soon as we answered we established our names and proceeded to explain that we do not know where our pizza is. This was quickly followed by no reply and a speedy hang up. That's when we tried to call again and we were left on hold for a total of 15 minutes. The delivery boy finally calls and says that he's here. So we go out and pay for our pizza at 12:50 a.m. it is now Saturday we ordered this Friday just for it to come the next day. 4 out of 6 of us we're already asleep how were we supposed to eat and enjoy this delectable fine dining of QUALITY Pizza if 4 out of 6 of us are asleep. So we tips him for the meal on top of the pay after such a long wait almost 2 hours. We finally go inside set the pizza on the table and open all of its contents to see what are wait has bought us.

The associate we spoke with ensured us they would be careful and she had nothing to worry about.  I called after the pizza had arrived to inform them that she was very ill, and the associate told me that maybe she should not have ordered from Domino's then.  When I was displeased with his answer, I was hung up on. 

I wrote a letter, and was contacted by a regional manager, who put me in contact with the store manager, and I was offered an apology and a refund.  It has been two months and I have called several times, and while they say they are trying to do the refund, I wonder if anyone is really trying anything.  
It is apparent to me that there is an extreme management problem going on here and no one knows how their systems work.

I only wanted the refund because of the blatant disrespect i was given over the phone when I was letting the store know my beautiful wife was extremely sick on our vacation, and they were the reason for it.

My advice to anyone with allergies, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  I don't even want the refund anymore because I am so very annoyed with everyone's absolute incompetence.

Papa John's is always very helpful, and my wife has never been sick, because they mean it when they say they are careful with their product.

Generally I used to hate Domino's pizza so hard because of the overwhelming salty taste. I came to figure that their pizza is actually alright if you stick with vegetables and cheeses. If you must get meat, make sure it's with some veggies or don't get pepperoni by itself so it's not that bad. 

I redeemed my coupon and opted for the Spinach & Feta. It only takes 10-15 mins to be ready for pickup. This ""artisan"" pizza dough is oval shaped and still the same recipe as handtossed. It doesnt come with garlic butter brushed on the crust. So this whole artisan thing is just a phony marketing gimmick. The flavor was actually very good. This was the first pizza I actually LIKE and i am WILLING to order it again in the future and pay the full $7.99 for it.  Feta cheese was always my favorite cheese since ever so that's probably one reason I really enjoy the taste. As for the size I would say thay it is smaller than a large but bigger than a medium. It was also way uglier and uneven, leaving some parts mushy or extremely crispy but somehow it was still pleasant. With the extra cheeses on this pizza (I think it has 3 total- mozz, feta, parmesan) it's more filling than most, if not all their pizzas. They are quite skimpy with their cheeses, so I dont think ordering extra chees does anything at all

I bumped my review to 4 stars because I can finally enjoy my pizza and now I don't have to keep wishing that they were a Papa Johns instead. I share the same block with this location so it's a big deal to me to actually enjoy something from DOMINOS for once.

I instructed him we would be there to pick up the pizza instead of waiting for the delivery driver again.
I sent my assistant to pick up the pizza and nothing but aggravation once she arrived. 
It is now 2:05 pm and my assistant is just now getting back with HOT pizza.
When my assistant asked if we she could have a drink since we were billed for a delivery charge the manager then told her that there is .40 cent difference.

IS THIS A REAL CONVERSATION? WITH SUCH A HUGE INCONVEINENCE YOU HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL THE CUSTOMER THERE IS A .40 CENT DIFFERENCE.

Apparently, this location didn't get the memo.

I had received a text message with a coupon code that was a pretty good promotion. Being sleep deprived on a Saturday after a long week, I was easily compelled to take advantage of the offer. I used the Droid app to compose my order. (Sidenote: The score I'm giving for this review was not inveigled by the app either way - I just figured I'd throw it in for anybody interested.) The app was streamlined nicely and pretty straightforward. Granted, it's not as if you need to have your hand held to order a pizza, but the flow and logic make it even easier. I didn't bother with the order tracker. It's going to get here when it gets here - nothing will change if I track it or not. It's not a FedEx shipment or anything. 

Delivery arrived quicker than the ETA I received upon checkout. 

Aside from the pizza, I also ordered Chicken Alfredo pasta. Needed a little more sauce, but it was just fine coming from a chain pizza place. I wasn't expecting homemade Italian fare.  The pizza, however, was an entirely different story ...

It looked pretty appetizing, and had a good amount of cheese. I ordered the hand-tossed pan crust. It didn't take anything more than the first bite to realize that the dough was pretty undercooked. Definitely; well, doughy. It wasn't just a little bit undercooked - it was raw dough. The fact it was pretty light and airy helped a little bit, but I barely got through the tiny slice I started out with - mainly because I was hungry enough to make it through; hoping the crust would be enough to nominally quell the growls of my depleted stomach.

I pulled each of the remaining slices to make sure it wasn't just the one slice I picked. That wasn't the case. Pulling them apart, the raw, sticky dough stretched out as if it were melted cheese.

I plan on contacting either a manager or franchisee shortly - the review will be updated accordingly to reflect the level of customer service in how they react and deal with the complaint.

Again, the increased ad campaigns have tried to connote that Domino's is focused not on speed, but meticulous quality. While this may very well be this particular location - especially considering the average score from fellow Yelpers - it's very likely this experience will detract me from ordering Domino's again; regardless of location.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,7,4,1,TBJvzXj4oXyWo2e-qKoMvg
