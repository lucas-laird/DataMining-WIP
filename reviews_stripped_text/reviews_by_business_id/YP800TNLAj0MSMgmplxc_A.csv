That strawberry butter is like ice cream! My husband had the biscuits and gravy. The sausage gravy had a great amount of sausage and very flavorful. The service and food get 5 stars.

Hubby ordered the meatloaf he devoured it, and is now complaining that he ate too much.  But he enjoyed it.

I went with a friend who is a professional chef and he raved about his meal. I wanted to try so many things, but when I saw the monte cristo sandwich, I had to order it because not many places in Vegas do it right. The server, warned me that it was a lot of food. He was not kidding! When the order arrived, there were four sections of the sandwich on the plate; garnished with fries. My chef friend said they cooked it correctly. The sandwich was double dipped in batter smothered with powdered sugar (although I could have used a lot more powder sugar-sweet tooth). It came with a side of raspberry sauce to dip the sandwich in. It was crispy on the outside and moist and warm on the inside layered with cheese, ham and turkey...It just melted in my mouth. So deliciously good. I have to come back and try other things on the menu. BTW: I had to take 1/2 the sandwich and fries home.

They saw us waiting but seated a party that walked in right after us before us. When we were seated, we waited awhile for our server to even talk to us. Another party was seated after us and got their drink orders in before us. We waited forever for our food. Other groups of people came and left before we got our food. We had three cups of coffee while waiting forever for our food. Our server, along with the other workers hardly check on us. Even the manager never came to see if we needed anything. Our server came and asked if we wanted more coffee, we replied that we just wanted our food. She just said, I know but it's kind of busy.  We did see that it was busy but that doesn't explain why other groups that came after us already got their food and left. When one of our plates were done, our server grabbed it, but for some reason had someone else deliver it. 10 minutes after the first dish came, sever finally comes over and says that the manager will comp the last two dishes. No apologetic tone to it. Manager finally comes and talks to us, and again, not really an apologetic tone. We were there for over an hour and it was a bad experience. This place is ran chaotically. You hardly see smiles on the workers faces. Guy at the station continuously yelling, I need a runner. In my opinion, a good place would work as a team. Not expecting everyone else to do things for you. It doesn't matter what your title is, you do your job and help others when needed. I only saw two workers that actually worked hard.

I gave it a 4 star since  I've only been there once and would like to go back to try the meatloaf since they were out. 
The place was nice and clean, bathrooms were spotless and when we arrived the place was quite busy. We were seated right away and only waited about 30 seconds before our drink order was taken.

Prices aren't the lowest in town for the simple reason that their food sales aren't subsidized by video poker machines like most other places in town serving diner-style and bar food - but they are more than reasonable, and well worth it to get away from the usual poker-bar atmosphere that pervades the area.

Walking in we were seated quickly and everyone greeted us. I enjoyed how clean and organized the metro diner was. I enjoyed seeing the open kitchen concept and the diner seating area by the kitchen. The specials chalk board is really cool. 

I was a little disappointed to not see a tuna melt on the menu. 

Jason asked our waitress what her favorite sandwich was to eat and her response was ""lots of people order the metro club or the philly"". We just looked at each other and laughed since that wasn't what we asked. We wanted her favorite. Next we asked for a few more minutes and then ordered the bissel breakfast with a side of avocado and the French dip with a salad.

This is where we went from four stars to three stars unfortunately. The food was just mediocre and bland. The potatoes I received were dark almost black and I had to ask for another batch. They were very nice about it though. The avocado was not ripe and hard to eat. I had to add salt to the new potatoes too. Jasons French dip looked sad. Not enough meat and the bread didn't look toasted. Maybe they don't toast it though? The only thing I really enjoyed was the salad Jason ordered which came with a hard boiled egg.

Following after came out server Ralph. Who btw, is outstanding. He greeted us and asked if we have been here before. We told him it was our first time. He then told us about their special which is written on a huge chalk board. It had drink specials, food specials including soups and deserts. He also told us about the menu and that items highlighted in green were customer favorites. He was very knowledgeable on the menu and also made recommendations.

He quickly returns with our drink orders. We were so excited I ordered a cup of their special The Minorcan Clam Chowder and  chicken and waffles, we ordered 2 right away not realizing the size portions. Omg! HUGE! So I quickly asked him to change one to a croissant French toast. Orders came out (and it came out quick!) There was a bit of confusion but that was totally my fault? Grrr..on my part! However, Ralph and the manager were so outstanding about it! And really it wasn't a big deal to me and my BF. However, Ralph was so sweet and said that they didn't want us to have something we weren't happy about. Which in our case, we just didn't think we could eat all the chicken, that's all.

The Minorcan Clam Chowder was delicious. It is definitely not your traditional Clam Chowder by any means. This Chowder almost looked like a chili w/ a tomato base. Chunks of clams, tomatoes and veggies with a hint of spice. So De-licious! I only ordered a cup which I'm definitely getting a bowl of next time around.

Before The chicken and waffles came out. Ralph had put together a mix of syrup and Louisiana hot sauce. As I stared patiently, watching the two being mixed into one bowl. Who would of thought...chicken and waffles came out and honestly, it is one the best actually it's The BEST I've had in Vegas and the portion size is HUGE! You get half a chicken, YES, half a chicken (mixture of wing, drumstick, thigh and breasts) w/ yummy waffles, topped with strawberry butter. OMFG, That strawberry butter though! So good! I've never had it before and I thought it was so good with the waffles, I almost didn't need syrup.

So many options from waffles, pancakes, omelets, to chicken and waffles, breakfast sandwiches, heuvos rancheros, and avocado toast. So many delicious choices. And you can order from the whole menu the whole day. 
I ordered the Fruity Belgian waffle; a fluffy waffle covered in fresh strawberries, blueberries, and bananas. I ordered it without bananas. It was sweet without being cloyingly sweet. The warm syrup was perfect with it. 
Others in our party ordered the kids breakfast platter, Philly cheesesteak, cheesy grits with bacon and eggs, croissant French toast, and kids silver dollar pancakes. My husband loved that they had grits even though we aren't in the south. Everyone left full and happy.

What is inconsistent is the service. Some servers (waitresses especially) are super nice and so friendly. But there are a couple with attitudes. 
Once I barely got my change for a $20 and she came and gave it to me out of the same type of bill  holder you give to customers. I had brought a $20 up to the counter and asked her to bring me a $10. Instead after taking her sweet time-she finally came to the table where I had to remind her. Do they share tips there or pocket them as soon as they get them?  Another time my friend made a comment and was over heard by (not our server) but another waitress who had to gossip and tell our server what she heard. Because our server came over and confronted us to ask if we wanted to change servers. I do not blame the woman who served us and she has since waited on us. I think the other waitress was stirring up trouble and it makes me wonder if they are competing for tips there. I see some people doing the job above and beyond and others slacking.

On all occasions it was at the urging of my friends because they saw the Triple D's episode that featured the Metro Diner.  The 2 stars rating has nothing to do with the services at both locations which were very good.  It is the food that my friends and I found to be average or less than average.  The fried chicken was average but salty with a dry and boring waffle.  At another diner I ate at, the waffle was tasty even without the syrup.  At this Serene diner, the corned beef hash I ate was dry and crumbly like salted saw dust.  I guess the poached eggs were supposed to add the moisture the beef hash needed.  This past Mother's Day, my companion insisted on dining at the Serene diner because Guy Fieri  cannot be wrong.  The service was very good and the joint was jam packed with customers.  I didn't mind the crowd or that the food was slow coming out of the kitchen.  I decided to try the Hot Turkey Plate and it was boring.  How can you mess up a simple dish?  The turkey and gravy were very salty.  The gravy looked and tasted like it was spooned off the top of a steam table gravy pot.  The baguette was dry like an old dinner roll.  My companion did not finish her waffle and withheld her assessment of what she ate.  I think she did not want to admit Mr. Fieri is not flawless in his restaurant reviews.

As we were sitting down, the only other people waiting -- a party of 6 -- were called to their table.  At that point we were the only people waiting in their small waiting area.

A minute or two later another couple comes in and asks for a table for two.  There are two ladies behind the podium who can clearly see us waiting, and one of them immediately seats the two people that just came in. 

My wife and I got up and left immediately.  I told the remaining person at the podium that it was really rude to not seat us before a couple that just came in.  She did not apologize but only told me ""She didn't say anyone else was waiting.""  Hello?  Use your eyes.  We were literally sitting less than 5 feet in front of you!

The staff was super friendly, welcoming, patient, and helpful with plenty of friendly jokes/comments.
The location serves breakfast, and lunch with beverage choices for both breakfast and lunch. No alcohol! So if you are one of those who needs an adult beverage with every meal you will miss out on it here.

Now as for the food.... it was a bit blah.... or maybe we ordered the wrong things! To be fair we asked the staff their recommendations, and because we were not wanting breakfast or big sweet eaters we chose other options (our fault). 
I went with the philly cheesesteak with French fries. The fries were great! The cheesesteak bread was not soggy nor toasted so done that the bread cuts up the top of your mouth. Plenty of meat, cheese, and peppers. Wasn't disappointing. I felt content, and full.
My companion ordered the Shrimp pull boy sandwich. He said it sucked. Like 1 star status. He said the gravy (sauce) was ranch dressing mixed with chipotle sauce. The shrimps were fried and he really needs to go back to New Orleans to get a real one hahaha!

After a long afternoon of Christmas shopping, we decided to stop in for an early dinner. We were seated quickly and the hostess pointed out the daily specials as we began to browse over the menu. Lots of variety, including many tasty breakfast dishes and comfort foods. I ordered the hot turkey plate which tasted just like a good home cooked thanksgiving dinner. Their portions are massive so be prepared to have a hearty meal and if you cant conquer it, take the rest of it home to indulge in some delicious leftovers. Our server was simply fantastic. She was so helpful and brought our food to us very quickly. Same thing once we were finished with our meal, she was happy to bring out Togo boxes quickly and split our checks with ease. When we were leaving, at least a dozen employees told us ""thank you for coming in and have a wonderful day!"" With all that attention, we felt like celebrities!

I was so disappointed because one would think the name Metro Diner evokes feelings of quality food like on the East Coast.

4654843,2018-03-12,6,YP800TNLAj0MSMgmplxc_A,"Metro Diner is one of the newest chains to land on Las Vegas soil. Achieving its third month of business, this is the fourth Metro Diner to open in the Las Vegas valley. 

  After hiking on the Seven Hills trail system, my brother and I were undecided on where to eat. Then I recalled that there was a new Metro Diner down the street. Both my brother and I appreciate the burgers that Metro Diner serves. So off we went to Metro Diner for a post-hiking dinner. It would be my second visit to a Metro Diner.

  This Metro Diner is located in the Eastern Beltway Shopping Center which is the power center that includes a hyper busy Walmart Super Center, Home Depot, Sam's Club, and Petco. It also includes one of the most dysfunctional and dangerous parking lots in Las Vegas made worse by a serious need for a traffic signal at its Serene Avenue exits. Fortunately, Metro Diner is closer to Spencer Street than Eastern Avenue which eliminated much of the aggravation of having to drive through a  dysfunctional and dangerous parking lot. We'd leave the car in a parking space equidistant from the Walmart Center g.m. entrance to the pod where Metro Diner is.

  Upon walking inside Metro Diner, the man up front told us to sit anywhere. There wasn't much of a greeting at the same time that nobody told us about the specials on the board. This is a totally different experience from the experience that I had at the Rainbow Road Metro Diner in September, where the man stepped outside to welcome me to the diner before my waitress told me about the specials. Here, our waitress arrived a few minutes later with the three page menus. I thought that our waitress was nice at the same time that she could of used more training. Just like a badly needed traffic light is missing at the Serene Avenue exits, so was my badly needed Coke Zero refill. Nobody inquired about the Coke Zero refills. Then for the first time that I can recall dining out, the waitress gave us the wrong check. Obviously, I felt that there is some room for improvement in service.

   As far as the burger there is zero need for improvement. In my opinion this chain ought to be named Metro Burger and Breakfast. When I quickly perused the three page menu that includes lunch and dinner plates, breakfast, and sandwiches I decided on the burger. For $10.99 I ordered the Bacon, Mushroom, and Swiss Burger medium done with French Fries. For an additional $2.99, I ordered a glass of Coke Zero. If Walmart in the parking lot's motto is ""Save Money and Live Better,"" Metro Diner's motto could be ""Spend money and live better."" The thick and juicy burger melting with Hickory smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and Swiss cheese was delicious. It tasted as if I was eating a burger right off the BBQ grill. And in contrast to some restaurants, the mushrooms did not appear to be from a Green Giant can. The tasty French fries sharing the plate with the burger tasted home made. Following this review are two pictures of the Bacon, Mushroom, and Swiss Burger. Just a warning, You might get hungry.

 In conclusion, I am a fan of their Bacon, Mushroom, and Swiss Burger. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, my return factor to this Metro Diner is 3.5 stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,12,4,dmvtqwPQMNrLtWcRXPcPYQ

I love the diner feel (the restaurant feels like it's been there for years and I love that feeling), the food is very classic diner food (filling, fair-priced, and filled with love) and they serve everything on the menu all day long.

Coming from the Midwest, I've been able to enjoy many diners and I guess I didn't realize I was missing those experiences until I walked through the door of Metro Diner. The waitress greeted us with a smile, the restaurant smells like pancakes and coffee, and I left full and happy. Those are a few things that really make a diner a quality one for me.

I chose to have the Metro Pancake, a 12"" thick, fluffy pancake. I tricked it out with bananas baked in and chocolate chips on top. It was worth the price, even though I only finished 2/3 of it. I also can't wait to go back and have the meatloaf dinner because that looked amazing coming out of the kitchen, as did the avocado toast. 

I am very much looking forward to coming back here. I can't wait to bring friends for breakfast. This place is awesome.",ny5uD7wcIZ01hUXE50Qz2Q,0,0,5,9rpQzgaxb-aznpd7yB7X3g

4699285,2018-02-04,13,YP800TNLAj0MSMgmplxc_A,"This is the new third location of Metro Diner in the Vegas area and service was outstanding. The Henderson location was ok, but this one really stood out for me. After running errands all day, I needed to get something to eat, but didn't want fast food. Luckily, when I walked in, I was seated right away. Our server, Ralph, introduced himself, named off the specials of the restaurant and had a warm smile throughout the whole time. 

I went for their famous chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. My friend ordered the San Francisco Benedict. Ralph comes out from the kitchen and informs me of the hot and sweet dipping sauce for the chicken. He puts out the syrup, a bowl, pours out some syrup in the bowl, and puts in a couple of dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce and lets me know I could add more hot sauce if I wanted more heat. Sensing my skepticism, he assured me it was great combination. The food came out shortly and I spooned some of the hot-sweet sauce over the chicken and the waffles. First off, the waffles were super fluffy. I am not a huge fan of waffles because sometimes it's too crunchy and cuts the roof of my mouth, but these were breakfast clouds. The whipped strawberry butter was excellent and gets extra points for 1) being whipped and not a hard block of butter 2) not super sweet. The chicken served is a half of a whole chicken, so portion is huge. It was super juicy and had a great crust. If you get the syrup soaking in the crust, it softens the crust a bit in a sweet and hot flavor blanket. A little heat and a little sweet is what I like! Outstanding plate! My friend said the eggs Benedict was delicious and the big slices of avocados was a big plus. They did not skimp on the goodies here! 

When it was time for the check, I did not feel rushed at all. The male manger came out to see how our meal and service was too. Nice! It is so refreshing to get genuine service and great food at the same time without breaking the bank. I will definitely be going back to this location and kudos to Ralph and the gentleman manager for an excellent meal and service to match.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,28,30,5,bJhSlYGnVAXMPcnm1HLiMw

Service is excellent, genuine and always friendly (5 visits so far, first review). For dinner they feature chalkboard specials.

I thought the silverware tucked away in its own little protective sleeve was cool. Especially during flu season when you don't want viruses falling on your fork before you even get there. 

Our waitress brought our menus and took our drink order. She was incredibly nice and very engaging with us. Unfortunately she had to leave as it was the end of her shift. Luckily the waitress who replaced her was just as nice. She gave me some very detailed information on the items in the menu. I decided to try the bacon, mushroom, Swiss burger. My wife had the Charleston shrimp and grits and the kids had pancakes and Mac and cheese. 

The burger was ok. A little dry for my taste. I wish there was mayo or some kind of aioli sauce. The bun seemed a little stale also. The bacon was cooked perfectly, nice and crispy, just the way I like it. 

The Charleston shrimp and grits were interesting. I personally don't like grits but I tried it just because my wife ordered it. This is definitely not your regular grits. There were these grits mixture patties that were fried, swimming in some kind of sauce that reminded me of cream of mushroom without the mushroom flavor. The grit patties didn't have much flavor to them considering it's infused with cheese, roasted red peppers and andouille sausage. It had the texture of mashed potatoes with a fried outer shell. Believe it or not I liked this dish better than my burger. Eating all the different components all in one bite made me go back for more and before I knew it I had eaten one the patties. 

The Mac and cheese had good flavor but the noodles were over cooked. 

Now it sounds like we had a bad experience with the food here but I am totally going back there again.",WXI5MtL-eBjpGIFQsUMaHw,0,1,4,n5gq_KMTfJAE0xfz8D6RSQ

I typically order the same thing (breakfast) but stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered the BLT with the freshly made potato chips... mmmmm! So glad she recommended them. If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out. Great food, friendly service and good prices.",e5os6zBaIemGLqoJ6IMIlw,0,0,5,wvBV2JKBqSODxuHXr26XwQ

Located centrally on the southeast side of the town with many other places to shop and eat around. Parking is not an issue as there are plenty enough. First time dining here and already i felt as if i had dined here before. It really gives you that homey style diner vibe. Walking right in you can tell that this place works really fast and really hard. We got seated fairly quickly, but i can imagine long wait times during the peak hours and with big party. There are booth style tables and regular square tables that can seat 4 people comfortably. The waitress i had was very nice and explained all we needed to know about the place and also recommended to us what was a crowd favorite. She also noted that the portions come fairly large so order accordingly which i think is always a great tip! One of the beast meatloaf i ever had here in vegas !! the chicken and waffles was alright. Comparing it to other chicken and waffles around the valley. Was not disappointed at all. Will definitely come back !!

They offer Military Discount! - Awesome !! and Thank You !!",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,0,1,5,ls_VrP-uTBJU9CIn-Q-blQ

The food came and the chicken was very crisp and we both thought it was among the very best we've ever had. The waffle was crisp but tender inside. There was so much food we had to take some home. There were so many other menu items that sounded good we'll have to return soon. Very highly recommended.,2xhndq3P25DZvlSdHgJUgw,0,0,5,_nS__KpP6J4fudpsDgfUyw

Metro Diner is located in the Home Depot/Walmart shopping center at Eastern/Serene. A little bit of an odd location but we found it after a few minutes. We were seated as soon as we arrived.

Cindy was our server and was fantastic. Explained the menu and specials and really made us fell welcome as first timers. I chose the San Francisco benedict and my mom chose the bissell breakfast. I loved how they order on the iPads so the kitchen has your order before they leave the table. 

The food came out pretty quickly. My benedict had sliced avocado and tomato served with crispy hash browns. It was very good. All of the flavors worked really well together and the hash browns were cooked just how I like them. The bissell breakfast was huge. Eggs, hash browns, toast, bacon and pancakes. Whew...you better be hungry! The pancakes were excellent, really light and fluffy. 

Metro serves breakfast, lunch and dinner all day so is a perfect stop no matter what you are hungry for. I will definitely be back to try their famous chicken and waffles!",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,2,1,5,QdWg8uYOG4WSyFmnpMNU6Q
