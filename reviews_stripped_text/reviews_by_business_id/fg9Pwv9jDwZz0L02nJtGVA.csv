I awayse get there chicken curry and mung bean stew, it alwayse hit the spot!  Ive tried many of there other dishes, some is good and some is bad, but for some reason i alwayse end up ordering the same thing haha. The Service is ok, typical of any asian restaurant haha. The best part about Kapit is probably the parking lolz theres plenty of it. I would love to rate kapit bahay alittle higher but they need to change up there menue alittle more. I remember coming here a few days in a roll and the menue was the same, after awhile you get kinda burned out haha.  Overall, Food is decent, service is ok but parking is great!

565577,2010-05-18,0,fg9Pwv9jDwZz0L02nJtGVA,"This place has been around for a while, at least over 9 years. You have to come here early enough to get the food while it's still fresh, otherwise they're just sitting under the heating lamps all day. 

The food here is not the best Filipino food around town, but it is just OK. The bistek (beef steak) is a bit too chewy and a lot of the meat has a lot of fat. I know cooking meats with the fat is what makes the meat nice and juicy, but this is really overboard. You're pretty much just getting an order of the sabao (sauce) and onions with cooked fat! 

I used to come here just to get the adobo pusit (squid) since they seem to be the only Filipino fast food place that serves it. But the last time I ordered it, it didn't taste the same. I'm not sure what it was, I think it was the way the sauce tasted. It was more watery than usual or something. Whatever it was, it was enough for me to tell myself not to order it anymore. 

They also have some Filipino grocery items in the store. But beware, they are REALLY expensive! A bag of chicharon that costs $1.29 next door at Ranch 99, costs over $3.00 at Kapit Bahay! You'd think it would be a lot lower knowing its more than half the price right next door!

1019877,2013-01-09,1,fg9Pwv9jDwZz0L02nJtGVA,"This is not a fancy place. It's a fast food Filipino joint that serves you up a good one or two item plate at a good price. I think some people are expecting the world by looking at some of these reviews. The food is pretty good and authentic tasting. I actually like it a lot. My favorites are the fried pork cracklins with meat attached, chicken and pork adobo and the beef steak with onions. I've been here with quite a few different people, also have been to the one at the Hawaiian market. I think the place is a hit or miss with people because of the authentic nature as compared to what you're going to get at Panda Express. I'm not a big microwave looking food eating kind of guy. I like real food that looks like it was cooked from atop a stove. I think this place grows on people, as it has on a few people I've gone with. Their reviews were so so maybe on a two star level after a first visit. But two different people, after trying it out with me a first time and being at a level two, ended up asking me if I wanted to eat at ""MY"" Filipino place. Which to me tells me both these individuals were not really at a two star rating. After a second visit I would estimate their star rating to be at a 3.5 to a 4. You kind of just have to give it a shot for yourself and don't be thrown off by the authentic look.. not all fast food joints have to cook their food in a microwave and have that rubbery consistency that a lot of people have come accustom to.

On another note, when I first use to go to Kapit.. the customer service wasn't the greatest. Now either I've been there so many times that they have warmed up to me or they have caught on that giving good service is a good business practice.. i don't know. For whatever it's worth, the food at the price was impressive enough for me to come back for more and I think if you give it a shot, you'll feel the same way. If you give it a 2 star rating, try it a second time and see if it has grown on you. It may take a visit or two to appreciate the authentic nature of the food.",riqsXI1-UB5kJw1gGmUfNw,4,0,5,SROPVH7CY5MEf9JzHM9qvA

In my many travels i rarely find a place like this. I'm glad i got off the freeway an exit too early.

The thing that grabbed my attention first was the Filipino fast food sign in the window.  After a long day of traveling and work I didnt want to drive around endlessly, or endure the usual fast food crap that's out there.  

Im pretty sure it was Gloria that helped me, she was friendly, inviting and helped me identify a few dishes that were somewhat strange to me.  

I ended up ordering longaniza that was fantastic, very tender and flavorful.  the second was a beef with potatoes and carrots and spices which reminded me of something my mom would cook.  Its nice to have flavors and a meal like this when a person is away from home

At the end of there these sugar glazed burrito looking things that i asked about, Gloria said it was dessert.  I think it was some type of pastry dough, with bananas maybe? and glazed with sugar.  I have no idea what these are called but the taste and texture  brought back a familiar flavor and texture that I haven't had since i was a kid.

if you're a visitor to the Las Vegas area and if you're not a club rat cruising the strip for tail, i suggest you take a quick drive, or taxi to china town and give this place a try.

I was introduced to this great place by my best friend who's father when I was a teen used to make some flavor-filled dishes that woke both us up in the morning to a strong mouth-watering aroma that stinged your nose. But that very smell gave me the most greatest hunger. This place is very similar to how he used to cook his dishes for us. 

They have a chain restaurants in CA also ( which I always go to) This is the only place I go when I have a craving for some authentic Filipino food... dishes like my favorite ground beef and veggies in a orange sauce or anything with chunks of meat in it with veggies.

My most favorite dish to get is the Pork Sinigang. It is thee best here. Soooo much kick in this soup... one spoon sip and you'll be gulping it down or putting it all over your rice. It's just the greatest tasting dish there. I cannot get enough of it. I usually take it to go in a big to go container and just enjoy the flavorful sour soup at home. It was a bunch of green beans, spinach or cabbage and chunks of pork meat in a tamarind base soup. If you don't like sour than skip this and try all the other great entrees. 

There are so many to choose from and you just have to go with what looks good... well maybe not coz some dishes look messy and not that appealing but they sure taste delicious. Oh yea they also have this mango drink that I always get... very refreshing on a hot thirsty day. Don't forget the vinegar and garlic sauce that should be on the corner of the restaurant.

Setup almost in a Panda Express style, there is a someone who dishes out what you  want from behind a glass partition.   Combo meals come with rice and can be substituted for pancit but in my opinion their pancit was nothing to write home about so keep your change.  All their options are relatively good.  Nothing will wow you and want to make you book the next flight to Manila but nothing will disappoint either.  The best of the bunch include the Chicken Adobo, Menudo, and Beef Caldereta.  

Service is very friendly and approachable, which is what this gringo needs.

Lady that helped us was friendly. It wasn't busy when we went.  We dined in.  It was kind of hot inside.  We sat under an air vent that was apparently blowing air, but I felt hot.  

Anyway, as for the food, one would think that no matter what, pancit would usually be on the steam table.  Kare Kare, I know some places serves it on certain days, and yes some days, people run out.  First off, the food on the steam table honestly in my opinion didn't look too appealing.  I can understand that Kare Kare can run out and it so happen on this day they were out.  They didn't have pancit on the line.  But I'm guessing I could have ordered it on the side, but I then I would have to wait.  What I thought was banana lumpia was actually their vegetable lumpia, and the price of just one, I thought was ridiculous.  Close to $2.50 was for one mediocre egg roll.  Their cantaloupe drink, when I ordered it, it wasn't ready.  It was a 10 min wait.  Good thing I like cantaloupe drinks, so I waited for it.  

It just seemed like they were just out of a lot of things that may have been there earlier in the day. 

Is this a spot that I would recommend anyone to try?  No.  Is it a place that I'd return to?  No.  Compared to Pinoy Pinay, their selection may not be a whole lot, but at least the food looks appealing enough to try.  Here, it just wasn't there.

I'm not saying that it's the best one the city, but it's definitely quick and convenient. All the food is already laid out there for you, and all you have to do is to pick and choose to your liking. There have options of one or two entree meals which I think is well worth it if you get the two entree. 

Every time we go there, the same ladies always helps us. I love it when she's there because she's very welcoming. She just has this kind of Filipino grandma persona that makes you want to buy some more items. Beware, if you're not Filipino, there could be some language barrier here. So, sometimes she could mean something as a compliment but it sounds a bit harsh to the ear. So, keep that in mind if you do decide to come here. 

I usually get the sinigang here because I'm a fan of soup. I have to admit that it's down to the very basic. Sinigang, at least to me, is supposed to be sour. Similar to Thai food's tom yum soup, but this one in particular almost tasted bland. I still like the hint of sourness to it. Again, it's basic Filipino food so I can't complain. 

Among other food, they have a pretty cool selection of snacks on the side that you can easily grab and purchase. I love the choices here even though the selection is pretty small. Regardless, they remind me of my childhood which is pretty awesome. 

The setting on this place isn't in its best shape as it almost looks run down. It's literally grab your food, sit and eat. This place definitely need renovation.",_hNSGB79xGhgys7GFhaYJA,1,2,3,LzdUpTdHugwH69Slha6kfQ

3839353,2015-06-18,10,fg9Pwv9jDwZz0L02nJtGVA,"I'd been craving Filipino food recently, so I decided to stop in here to satisfy that feeling. Kapit Bahay, located in the Chinatown Plaza, probably has the most authentic traditional Filipino dishes I've had in Vegas so far. 

The name of the restaurant, which loosely translates to ""neighbor's house,"" is fitting because the interior decor might remind someone of a traditional Filipino household. The inside is small and does not have a lot of tables, so it fills up quick. The staff was super friendly to me and was quick to serve, despite it being a little busy in there. Just on the other side of the food line, there's a grocery area where filipino snacks and other products (eskinol, efficascent oil, etc.) are sold.

They give out big portions at a good price, so it's pretty affordable (even if you do decide to get extra items or things from their grocery section). I had the kaldereta, pork adobo, and their chicken tinola. All were very flavorful and SUPER close to how my mom makes filipino food (but let's be honest, nothing ever beats your family's cooking).

They didn't have labels for their food, so you'd either have to ask about them or know for yourself what you're getting. I don't think their menu is set, so it's basically whatever they decide to cook that day is what they'll be serving. I'm pretty sure they always have the popular ""staple"" dishes like Adobo and Lechon available all the time. 

Overall, I think this place is definitely for those people who love filipino food in the style closest to it's roots (and yes, sometimes being ""too oily"" is part of that). The food is very authentic, affordable, and you get good portions! A must-try if you want to try food that reminds you of home.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,13,10,5,KWk2_pZi6amZJBqxbC0VjQ

Kapit Bahay was recommended to me by a good friend and he didn't mislead.  He said this was the kind of food his mother made and he grew up eating.  That sold me.

I walked in and immediately had a problem because most of the Filipino names were unintelligible to me.  Some things were not marked.  I got a 2 item platter to eat in and I knew I wanted the lechon.  Then I asked the woman what an item was and she told me it was silverfish.  This is a Filipino omelette with fish.  That then became my second dish.  As I was carrying my tray to the table, the woman asled me what kind of soup I wanted.  She decided I should have chicken soup and she filled a styrofoam cup with soup.

The soup was very good.  This was homemade and the broth was rich.  The lechon was a bit dry but I guess I shouldn't expect anything else.  It's a fast food place with the dishes already prepared and in warming trays like a buffet.  Of course it's going to be a bit try.  The skin was very crispy and flavorful and the dipping sauce you get made up for some of the dryness of the lechon.  I had never had the tortang dulong before and I'm glad I tried it.  The fish in the omelette was a good fit.  The omelette could have been hotter--heat lamps only do so much, but it was enjoyable.

Customer service was great!  The woman was being a surrogate sister for me making sure I had my soup with this hearty meal.  The price was certainly right, and the location was perfect!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,10,3,8Y8LEkFNL9Vw0gfamGjYzA

After all the American food we've been eating in this trip I wanted some rice on our last full day in Las Vegas... I'm not talking about Spanish rice or risotto rice or rice pilaf... although they're all yummy too, but I wanted good ole' white rice (not Uncle Ben's) or fried rice so where do we go? we head to Las Vegas Chinatown. 

This Chinatown Plaza in Las Vegas isn't anything like the Chinatown in San Francisco oh, heck no. This place is much smaller and clean! This is not too far from the Strip either. It's clean (okay, I said it twice) and easy to navigate to. Oh, but I digress... we were looking forward to a nice Chinese food dinner when we saw this ""Kapit Bahay"" Filipino eatery in the corner of this plaza. I wondered if this was the same fast food restaurant located at the Hawaiian Marketplace on the Strip which is no longer there when we looked for it. Anyway, at this location at the Chinatown Plaza we were glad that it was still open that late at the time. 

This 'turo-turo'-style family run restaurant had one other customer so we had the whole restaurant to ourselves pretty much. We each had the 2-item combo ($7.50) and when I saw the menudo still available I wanted it. We had some type of beef (not sure of the name) and also sinigang. The food was excellent and flavorful... definitely satisfied our hunger. The middle of the restaurant had a table-full of popular Filipino snacks! you name it they had it! Bought me a couple packages of my favorite Choc-Nut. The elder lady (""lola"") behind the counter was very nice and friendly and definitely showed us that Filipino hospitality... not just to us but also to foreign nationals that came in and bought food ""to go"".

Today was a day of shopping for Asian foods, beauty products and medicinal herbs. What a day! Foods, creams and spices I've never heard of. I just took it all in. When we were finished, I was definitely hungry! Right next door was Kapit Bahay. I was definitely excited to try it out as I LOVE Filipino food. 

When you walk in, you're definitely taken to a blast in the past, it seems like.  The walls were faded canary yellow, the tiling, tables and chairs were definitely outdated, to say the least. In the corner, the restaurant also doubled as a mini mart, selling snacks and goodies specific to the Philippines. The counter reminded me of a Filipino version of Panda Express. Most of the food was already prepared and lined up ready to order. The two ladies that were working the counter was a bit strange to me.  On one hand, they were super nice, but they had no patience! It was almost like I was expected to know everything and what I wanted. I felt a little rushed so I just chose the two items that I could pick out right away. 

For lunch, I got the 2 choice combo for $6.50.  I'll definitely give them that.  The price is affordable and very attractive to the audience. For my choices, I got the Pork Adobo and the Lechon. Pork Adobo is a pork cooked in soy sauce, vinegar and other spices. For this choice, it tasted like the adobo was sitting out for a while.  The meat was super dry and chewy.  The broth was also way too oily for my taste, but had a nice flavor to it, not too salty. The lechon was also a turnoff for me.  Lechon is roasted pork, including the skin and fat. This lechon tasted like it was under the heat lamp for a long time.  The meat was way to hard to chew through. I ended up abandoning that side, when all said and done.

At the end of our meals, my friend and I agreed that this wasn't the best of the best. I could tell some of the choices were really authentic, however, I think they need to rotate their food a little more so we (as customers) are getting the best of what they have to offer. Living on the other side of town, the best way I can put it is that fact that I probably wouldn't make a special trip to this restaurant if ever craving Filipino food.

Then she updated the older woman in Tagalog about the show. Or at least I'm assuming that what she was doing. I find that talking in front of your customers in a language the customer can't understand is RUDE, I don't care what language it is. So onto the food.....

GROSS! The lumpia was cold and old. My husband, who rarely complains or sends back food, made a u turn in the street to return the lumpia. The older woman says "" do you want me to put it in the microwave?"" My husband said, ""No, I'd like a fresh batch."" He was then told that they already made some and they're not making anymore. So he got his money back.
So, we get home and tried the chicken and pork adobo. Old, dry with a weird after taste. But we were home and didn't feeling like driving back and facing those people again.

I've eaten a fair amount of Filipino food in my life, and for whatever reason, I have NO idea what the names of any dishes are aside from halo halo, pancit and lumpia. It's actually pretty aggravating because I can describe the dish, but I can't name it.

There is a beef and onions dish, kinda like a stew almost that is killer here. Pancit is just okay. I've been to this location a few times, and really, the beef and onions dish is the only thing that sticks out to me (because it is my favorite anywhere that I go.) 

Be careful not to say that you want a personal size anything. Make sure you say plate. Pancit, 4 spring rolls and that beef dish ran me $17. A 2 item plate is $6. Same size servings I believe, but $3 more expensive and without rice if you accidently order like I did. Ummm... guess what look I'm doing with my face right now.

Walking inside, it's a typical small store/ restaurant for quick food. My husband orders the lechon and was in love. I had gotten the adobo and order a party tray for my potluck at work later on that night for only $18. The lady was so nice and generous to us. Her food was very home good happy. If you expect to have a 5 star dinner don't come here but if you want the moms Filipino home cook happy meal, this is the place sometimes it's not always about the food, it's the love that goes in it and the hospitality of the place.",Furcy6vV9If5NAniLuI1XA,1,0,5,ssWIfRPYoo8pJMnuDGVLiQ

Unfortunately, every time I've asked a relative how to make certain dishes, they've told me they have no recipe, and that they cook ""according to taste"".  The funny thing is that no matter who makes the Filipino food I love so much, it tastes exactly the way it's supposed to taste!  My hockey teammate brought me here with her relatives, and as soon as I walked in, it felt like I was home with my dad.  I ordered the combo with rice, chicken adobo, and pansit.  I also ordered fried rice.  The portions were just like what I would have had at my family get togethers, meaning gimongous!  And it totally tasted like the pansit, rice, and chicken adobo my dad, aunt, and grandma made!  Yummy!  I was thrilled to see they have a restaurant in Anaheim, which actually is miles from where I live, but at least I know where to go if I'm craving Filipino food near Disneyland!  The strip mall they call Chinatown is kind of funny because I never thought there would be a large enough contingent of Asians to support Asian businesses in Vegas.  So cool to see this here.",GO9BhMI0Lk0Fkaw4OsaU1Q,2,1,5,7YbVL2zhIHaPFpNsU7kZsw

Kare-Kare - I definitely have had better. I thought it was bland. Also, you have the option to not have any tripe in your serving, which is kind of nice.

BBQ Chicken - This item was good. It is kind of like my mom's marinade, but obviously, I love hers better. 

The lady who helped me was super funny. She kept calling me ""baby."" It made my experience interesting.

I am not sure if this place is the best in Las Vegas for Filipino food. I definitely will be trying other places first before I ever come back.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,3,JDaV8h7fTUi6sfOA1TbymA

This time it was the latter.  The older tita-looking lady was nice and wanted to serve me, she actually acted like she had a stake in the business and it's customers.  
The younger ate'-looking woman, looked at me when I came in, turned around, but then assisted some other customer when they walked in.  I clearly stated that I was first and she just went on with the other customer.  This happens in many Filipino businesses that I enter.  And maybe someone should tell workers that being rude to ""non-kababayans"" is not a good business practice.  I will never come to this restaurant again.
That being said let's talk about the food.
I ordered eggplant, mungo, and rice.  It came in a combo plate.  I added a balut and Sarsi on the side.  The eggplant was way to undercooked and could not be cut with a fork and spoon.  The mungo was overly salty and watery.  It was more tubig-go than mun-go!  
The best thing that I had there was the balut and the Sarsi. I would have liked to give it another chance and try their pancit and chicharon, perhaps a ""si-log"", but as I get older I no longer choose to spend money where I am treated as a second class citizen.
