360845,2017-07-29,1,tvu6MBZKZKHz17cbF1zIZA,"For service, I gave it 2*. The place had 2 tables each with about 2 people to 3. But my drink was not refilled. I almost completed my pho Dac Biet when my eggroll appertizer was served.
Food quality is a 1*. Too much MSG. my tongue tingles after a few spoons full of broth from the combination beef noodle soup. When I finished all the meat served from the bowl, there was too much noodle left. This was an indication of too much MSG and not enough meat. There was only 1 piece of tripe. 2 small pieces of tendon compared to Pho Annie. The brisket smelled old.
The eggrolls were small and only 2 pieces of lettuce given. There should be purple leaves and mint to accompany with the eggrolls. There was too little meat in the eggroll. This is confirmef by the very soft and not firm stuffing. Your bite will tell.
Plastic cup was given for my drink instead of in a glass. This is 2*.",lFlJGqYcirNXWo1WZ2xqpQ,1,0,2,EbmqVD0sAyEELC0TX5UHag

1295413,2017-08-28,0,tvu6MBZKZKHz17cbF1zIZA,"I was hoping this would be THE Vietnamese restaurant to go to from all the good Yelp reviews. We ordered the mango shrimp salad (delicious), the coconut snails ( we left it practically untouched. It was so sweet. It tasted more like a dessert dish than a savory coconut curry one) and finally the lemongrass chicken was just OK. It lacked the flavor of lemongrass. One of the waiters came by and asked about the coconut snails since it was just sitting there. We told him it was just too sweet. He offered no options to remake it for us, exchange for something else and/or maybe credit for the uneaten order. NOPE! I guess the $11 charge was more important than a returning customer. 

I love to support small businesses around the neighborhood. I hope for their sake, that they actually read some of the negative reviews and maybe attempt to make the simple changes for the better.  As customers, we invested our time to write the reviews, owners should spend the time to read them and see them as constructive criticisms and not insults to their businesses",gYUB5x8kfsTUIEBwsQ1CZg,3,0,3,5xUWe0QtEogPbiowZxzd9g

Environment - spacious and very clean.  Tables are comfy and restaurant is well lit.  We had dinner and lunch here.  Both times, it was not crowded and pretty sparse.

Service - Very good.  Our waiters were quick, polite, and quite courteous.  They also came by a few times to check on us and fill our waters.  No issues.

Food - very good.  We had the following:

1.  Eel hotpot (my wife and mother loved it).  I had the pork chops, rice, and steamed egg.  
2.  The pork chop was cooked to perfection - tender and dry.  The rice was a bit dry and the steamed egg meatloaf was just average.
3. Finally, we also had the shaken beef.  This was also very good.  Would recommend it!

Overall, both meals were pretty good, service was excellent, and it is a good place to  have a vietnamese meal.  Price was average for both meals - inexpensive, but not cheap.

I've had some really good dishes at their houses and with their family at their houses. They ordered all the expensive seafood with beers. Said it was the style to eat when drinking. They were so disappointed. Said the seafood tasted like frozen instant dishes & had no flavor. When I tried it, I had to agree. I'm not big on seafood but the food was bland. One of the friends kids had the marinated pork, that was actually good. Best thing on the table was the cheapest. This really seemed like a problem they should care about. I ordered the chicken and shrimp fried rice. Sucks, it came out hella late, the kid and our friends were already done eating. I felt uncomfortable eating while they waited for me. They must have forgot my rice order. The funny thing is, the restaurant at this same location did the same thing to me on a carry-out order I had a while ago. We ordered 5 of their expensive meals and they gave us one small rice. Waited 1 hour after ordering 45min in advance. When I addressed the issue with being shorted rice, she liked to me and said all 5 entree's only get one small rice. I pointed out the menu then she said that they ran out of cooked rice. I would have to wait longer. This last story is only relevant because I was told it's the same owners just different kind of food. I joked with my friends and said, I'll never return here to spend a good amount of money or rice. Lol. If they have a cheap lunch menu I'll give it a try, till then, 1 star.

Not bad, not good and the menu said it was $8.95. Get the check and was charged $11 for the dish.

I was relatively annoyed at this time but I get it...restaurant just opened. New employees. Whatever. I give them the benefit of the doubt and use cash to pay and wait for the change. The waitress comes out and gives me change and I find that I'm a couple dollars and cents short. I ask the waitress what the deal was and she tells me that they can't give me exact change because they don't have it. At this point I'm furious. Really!?

The owner also came over to our table to check how everything was. We tried snails cooked in coconut milk (a bit too sweet for my taste and so darn hard to eat. Getting those suckers out was hard work lol), mango salad with shrimp (again, too sweet for my taste and the mango was too ripe, so it didn't have the crunchy texture I was expecting. I do love that the dish had fried shallots in it.), baked clams (a simple and good dish. Clams tasted fresh. They added peanuts on top that added to the texture), and fried quails (can't go wrong with fried anything lol). We wanted to try the steamed snails with lemongrass, but they ran out. We went on a Sunday and all tables were taken, so this place has definitely become popular amongst the locals. Total including tax for the four dishes was about $56.

I mainly come for chicken pho, the hot pot looks good though. I just can't seem to get a group consensus on hot pot. This time I went on Friday night, found out they had switched owners again. I'm wondering if they got a new cook.
To make a long story short I ordered chicken pho and a beer. On the side I asked for crushed garlic, which was brought to me no extra charge. Fish sauce, Hoisin sauce and Sriracha was on the table. I recieved my bowl of pho hot and full of broth, noodles and green onion. It could have used a bit more meat. The broth was a bit on the oily side but bearable. It was a little too salty coming out of the kitchen. I added a light amount of fish sauce but was not able to add Hoisin after that. I added Sriracha. I had to ask for more limes, only one wedge was brought out for my bowl. The black pepper shaker was nearly empty. If the broth had been less salty I would have given four stars.

Looking at the menu, it was a typical vietnamese pho place, with noodles and rice plates. We were more adventurous and wanted to try their seafood  dishes: snails in coconut sauce, blood clams with peanut, some giant snails with gingers, and balut in tamarind sauce. 

The balut was too spicy for my partner but he was in love with the blood clams. My favorite was the snails in coconut sauce. Very addicting :)

The waiter was attentitive ( maybe too much ) because when we asked for our check, he assumed i was done eating and took my plate away :(",9AFz8PFh1nYyU5uiIihUng,2,0,5,E4xC4amQk4JX26-3TOztPQ

We did not come for the pho but for their shellfish. We ordered some snails, clams and other ocean delicacies. Food tasted ok but portion size were pretty small compared to other places we've been to that served the same type of foods for MUCH cheaper.

We ordered an appetizer mango salad, thai style soup pot and 3 shellfish entrees to share. Again portion size was rediculously small to justify the price. The total bill for 3 of us came out to $100 and none of us were close to being full. It's a good place to come hang out with your friends, relax, kick back a few beers and listen to people make a fool out of themselves on the karaoke but not recommended for dinner unless you're not very hungry of have deep pockets.",-PzjjXcXBCYyMUi69GF0Eg,5,0,2,L6KrtECij_juS1qfZsBiKg

They have all different types of snails if you are into it. I ordered about 3 different types of snails and it all tasted so good! We ordered the mango salad but it was too ripe. I had better so I was not impressed with that one. One of the snail dishes that has coconut milk (see picture) was a little hard and hassle to eat. If you are impatient like me, then I suggest you not to get it. But the sauce its good tho but I think it should be a little thinner not too thick.

Even though there was nobody waiting, the place was filled with dirty tables and we had to wait 10 minutes before getting seated. Seat on the booth and it was wet!!! They don't even bother to wipe it dry after cleaning it with soaking wet towel.  Server is not familiar with menu and can't even answer some basic questions. Food took forever and came out each was like 10 minutes apart. My friend had already finished eating when I finally got my order. Also missed our order of the cooked bean sprouts. The server was rude and drop off the check when I just started eating. Not impressed with the service and food.

Very dissatisfied with the service, I'm actually still sitting here waiting for the 2 regular pho's we ordered. I will never come here again.

Update on food:  Broth was tasteless. They left out some of the dressings.

5093134,2018-01-28,1,tvu6MBZKZKHz17cbF1zIZA,"IThis is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant with all the best appetizers and hot pots! Another jewel to open up in the Southwest. Pho Khong Ten is located on the Southeast corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs in the Albertsons Plaza on the side facing Warm Springs. There is always plenty of parking on the outside and the inside is very spacious and clean with lots of tables. Service is always excellent. This is for the most part a family business and the owner Stan is very friendly and welcoming. Staff is very attentive with good recommendations. We always get Tommy as our server who is awesome. 

This place is known for their Hot Pots and their special appetizers. I don't come here for their pho. I'm always here for their Canh Chua Ca (Sweet & Sour Catfish Hot Pot) and Grilled Oysters. If you haven't had it yet then you must try it. Definitely the best in Vegas. 

Canh Chua Ca - Sweet & Sour Catfish Hot Pot - Very Very good. Very authentic just like how my mom would make it. The broth has the perfect combination of sweet and sour with the kick of spicy if you add the fresh crushed red chili peppers that comes with it on the side. It is loaded with thick filets of catfish and all the yummy veggies like okra, bac ha, tomatoes, pineapples, and bean sprouts. They have the serving size options for 1 person (which comes in a big bowl which could easily be shared between them depending on how hungry they are) or the flaming hot pot sizes for 2 or 4 people. 

Com Suon Nuong - Very good! Grilled to perfection. Very well seasoned and deliciously moist. Not dry and tough like a lot of other restaurants I've been to.

Bun Bo Hue - Very good! Broth is perfectly seasoned and comes loaded with a lot of meat, blood, and tendon. 

Grilled oysters - I could eat like 2 dozen of these in a sitting. That's how good they are. Served hot and juicy right off the grill with green onion oil and crushed nuts. Salt pepper, chili pepper and limes served on the side

Coconut snails - great! The ultimate Vietnamese beer food. Love me some coconut snails. Served in a rich creamy coconut milk sauce with a side of toothpicks for you to pick your snails out of the shell with 

Grilled clams - deliciously served like the grilled oysters 

Mango Salad - love this! This is a very refreshing appetizer. 

Hot Vit Xao Me - 2 opened Duck eggs in a tamarind sauce. Good ..aka balut 

Goi Cuon - Good

I love this restaurant. Every time I come back here I'm always trying something new. I love how they're always adding delicious new specials to the menu too. So happy they are close to home. This place is great to celebrate any special occasion at bc they have large tables that could accommodate everyone. It even has a karaoke stage for singing which they turn on for after hours. Good place to come for a few drinks and yummy beer foods.",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,4,3,5,opcXzlho8Zta9IKGEzOs7g
