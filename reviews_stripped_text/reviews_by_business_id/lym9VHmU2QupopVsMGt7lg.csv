119245,2015-01-11,0,lym9VHmU2QupopVsMGt7lg,"Regardless of how one feels about chains, Chipotle in  produces undeniably good food, including the last things I would expect: forceful spicing, fresh, good-quality ingredients and attention to details. What's more, while the components of Chipotle's burritos, fajitas and tacos are made in advance, they are assembled to order, a crucial element in the leap from sustenance to pleasure.

The chain trumpets its use of free-range pork, chicken and beef, from humanely raised animals that are not fed hormones or antibiotics. I can't help applauding, though Chipotle applauds itself enough without my help. Still, poor kitchen practices can overshadow even the best ingredients. What's most impressive is how carefully Chipotle controls its cooking and serving operation, a difference you can taste, not just between Chipotle and other fast-food places but also between Chipotle and independent burrito shops.

I told him it was just my burrito, his attitude was very foul. Instead of trying to fix it in a positive attitude he told me as if I'm annoying him, ""I asked you if it was together.""

While you order, you tell them exactly what ingredients you want, how much, and best part is you witness it made!

I was told it'll be a couple seconds before the steak was ready because they had run out. There was one gentleman who also wanted steak before me so they brought out this little bit that looked like it barely had been cooked, I told them it was a little to undercooked for me so I asked if there was anyway I could just get the next batch and Carmen rolled her eyes and said no that's how it comes. I go to Chipotle all the time and have never received meat as raw as that. I took a photo for you guys to see if you would like. I told Carmen I didn't appreciate her attitude and she started laughing I then told the manager about her attitude who also started laughing.

There aren't really a lot of bad things to say about Chipotle, but at the same time, not a lot of good things to rave about either. The best part about Chipotle is the cilantro-lime rice; its buttery, fluffy, and has great flavor. No one does the rice better in the fast-casual market. 

Beyond that, everything else Chipotle offers is rather average. The protein selection is wide, but none of them strike me as particularly amazing. Chipotle also doesn't give you a lot of meat unless you ask for 'a little more,' or pay for double meat. The tortillas are bland and the cheese is almost too thick, as it creates a gelatinous layer on top of your bowl if you get it to go. 

I've also experienced many inconsistencies with the rice texture, meat temperature, meat seasoning, and various other aspects of something that seems fairly straightforward to cook. 

Overall, if you're looking for something fast, cheap, and relatively on the healthy side compared to something like McDonalds, than Chipotle is a solid choice. But if you really want amazing fast-casual Mexican food, go to Zabas; they have better selections like fish and shrimp, they don't skimp on anything, and their Cilantro Pesto is probably the greatest sauce ever created.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,3,j7sFWmnB-ao2bDpTx5mFMg

You select your menu item...ie Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla.  Then you instruct the employee making your meal on what ingredients you'd like on/in your item.....ie Pinto/Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa etc.

I decided to go for a Chicken Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, Hot Sauce, Rice.  To wash it down, I got a bottle of Izzle Clementine Soda.

The Burrito is huge and was delicious.  I really like their Hot Sauce at Chipotle, it has a nice kick to it.  I devoured the entire Burrito, then enjoyed my Izzle.

There was only 2/3 of the bowl filled, and the vinaigrette was not 'right'. It had a chemical taste to it and was really spicy. Normally I can get two meals out of the bowl, but this time I ate the whole thing and was still a little hungry. The bowl isn't too expensive. I understand they need tokens profit, but besides the meat and cheese, the other ingredients literally cost almost nothing. The most expensive cost to them is the container. At least fill the bottom of the bowl with the rice, a cheap filler that gives the illusion that it's a full bowl. I understand if you are trying to save $ by skimping on the product.

Maybe it was the time we went (although across the street I could go into In-N-Out two seconds before the door is locked for the night and everything served would be still fresh and employees would not act like you shat on their chests). 

Maybe it was the overt manifestation growing dissatisfaction in the lives of the employees. 

Maybe you should avoid this specific location unless you want COLD food, with dry meat (or hardly any ingredients if you order vegetarian). No lettuce in the lettuce bin. 

(An ASIDE): maybe it is easier to notice more negative components of an experience when the entire experience overall is negative .... WHY the hell do they ask what type of beans do you desire when you are asking for vegetarian? One type is vegetarian (black) and one is not (pinto); so is there an abundance of non-vegetarian patrons out there clamoring for over*priced vegetarian burritos who still want the non-vegetarian pinto beans? I mean, by all means ask, but why not ask ""black beans, right?"" instead of black or pinto. Maybe a vegetarian patronising Chiptole for the first time does not know that the pinto beans are prepared non-vegetarian. Reminiscent of McDonald's and their shit fries and their absurd aim to bamboozle patrons into consuming them as if they were vegetarian (perhaps Chiptole learned this practice while McD was in an early major investor).

Is it really that difficult to use two pieces of tortilla per taco? How has Chipotle not figured that out yet? Worst yet the steak tasted horrible almost sour like, and was so fatty and chewy I was spitting out half of the meat I did eat. My only consolation is knowing how much the stock price has gone down.

They make a big and filling burrito.  They have a nice selection of toppings to go on their burritos and I appreciate that one of those toppings is brown rice.  I almost always get  my burrito with brown rice and black beans.  For a meat I alternate between chicken, steak and barbacoa.  Last night I opted for the barbacoa.  It is a spicy braised beef shredded up nice.  It has a ton of flavor and is always tender.  Unfortunately is is also always salty.  As good as it is I could do without the heavy salt.  Maybe last night I should have gone with the chicken or steak.  Those seem to have a more pure and fresh taste.  But that is why I alternate between the three.  I like them all depending on my mood.  Moving down the line as I create my custom burrito I ask for one of the four salsas.  Yesterday I went for the corn salsa but usually I go with the medium heat tomatillo and tomato salsa.  I rarely get the hot salsa and the mild is too much so.  The corn salsa was not at all hot but it was tasty.  The corn adds a nice texture in the buritto.

4287076,2007-09-03,0,lym9VHmU2QupopVsMGt7lg,"Chipotle is one of my ultimate guilty pleasures. Each burrito, weighs in at approximately 900 calories. I feel like I have to run a marathon just to burn that thing off. 

I've been to both the UNLV and Lake Mead locations and at both places, the employees assemble the burritos at super-sonic speeds, with the precision of surgeons. They know just the right proportions to give. I mean, they have assembly down to a science. 

At the UNLV location, I've seen the line go out the door, but don't be discouraged, they move that thing along like the Matterhorn line at Disneyland. 

Okay, am I the only one that notices this? When you mix tomatoes and sour cream, it makes this awesome dressing. And the sour cream at Chipotle is really runny, so it mixes instantly. I feel like when I eat their burritos, there's a party in my mouth. 

And I rarely eat meat because of ethical reasons, but their vegetarian burritos are tha shit. I don't even feel like I'm missing out. 

Bonus. Their pork is free-range and all that good stuff, which actually takes care of those ethics issues. So sometimes I indulge in a fatty pig burrito (carnitas). 

My boyfriend swears by the Barbacoa fajitas burrito. He can inhale Chipotle burritos in one sitting, but it normally takes me two. 

Susan R is right, though. Its Subway meets Americanized Mexican food. I mean, come on ... they're owned by McDonald's.

Because you might just think ""well, of course you like it here! You're a foodie, this place has great food, so, duh!"" Well, yes, that's part of it. But there's more.

See, I AM a foodie. I love food. I love eating it, preparing it, and eating it when someone else has prepared it in exchange for money. But even though I am a foodie, my brother, alas, is not. My brother could not be pickier when it comes to food: burgers need to be plain, steaks need to be free of condiments, and the only acceptable beverage to consume is water. So you can imagine my dismay when it comes to my brother and I eating a meal together. He usually just wants lame food, and I want condiments galore. Enter Chipotle. 

The great thing about Chipotle, and also Subway, is that you can watch these guys assemble your meal right in front of you! And since everything is ""custom made"" at this place, you really only get what you want. My brother gets a plain steak burrito: steak, rice, beans, cheese. I get a steak burrito, too, but I have more stuff in it: steak, rice, beans, cheese, corn, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. This is really a place where we both get EXACTLY what we want, so we're both happy. 

Plus, it's a cool concept: pick how you wanna eat it (burrito, taco, bowl...), pick the protein (chicken, steak...) and then add the delicious plusses (lettuce, beans, rice...). 

I think one of the extra plusses of this place is that they have healthy options, too. If you opt for the chicken bowl with no cheese or guac or sour cream, it's pretty healthy. And, even better, it's still delicious! You can't beat that!",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,2,0,5,iJ6aD51Z3yq1ptw7F71vxA

Threw one burrito away in disgust (wtf is in that queso?! It smells and tastes SO bad!), my kid bit into and promptly spit out/threw up on his burrito so we disposed of that one as well. 

My husband took his burrito back as an example of what they did. The staff (rude, unconcerned  and incompetent but that's at least not a health hazard) only replaced the one burrito that was saved. 

Pro tip: bring back the vomit covered food if you want a refund/replacement. 

Turned out to be a blessing that they only replaced the one because we split it and it made us violently ill.

What's not okay is not being prepared for business and notttt knowing how to smile, be friendly, and handle weird situations such as what happened earlier. They ran out of brown rice and steak. Swear, we had a staring contest with them. My sister and I asked how long it will take and the employees told us 3 minutes for the rice and 5 for the steak. So we waited and didn't mind. We stood back in line and they said three more minutes. It's disappointing. Imagine you working a long day and have been amping up for good food to relax an chill only to come home to it being gone.

Basically, the service we got today wasn't good. Unfriendly staff, unable to tell right timing for food, and incomplete stock of food. I'm still gonna go back because chipotle is yummy, but today was myeh.",hjnE7cS0fPLaXABVs9lMgg,3,2,2,XrzsmPvsX1M8suORRtQmkQ

I can not say enough good things about her, the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful too, Andrea stood out most because I accidentally mixed up my orders and she made my plate all over again and I couldn't thank her enough. Gets two stars only because of andreas great service but that night I vomited everything from Chipotle (It had to be the beans because I gave some to my son and he was vomiting all night too) it was a rough night and day after, granted I won't be getting near a chipotle for a while.",8J0O5GCTXAGZNf2uKqstQg,0,0,2,OUCGJuoNa0HHqzc5_DHEsw
5902333,2012-05-16,0,lym9VHmU2QupopVsMGt7lg,"Call me unAmerican, but I hate fast food.  No McDonald's (unless I'm in Shamrock, Texas at 11:00 p.m.), no Burger King (the char on the burger is the gift that keeps on giving), no Wendy's, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, or Arby's.  Even In-and-Out doesn't make my heart go pitter-patter.  But Chipotle - ah, that's a horse of a different hue.  

Last night I was actually craving, salivating, for a Chipotle salad bowl:  romaine, chicken, black beans, onions and peppers, corn, pico de gallo, brown rice, a dollop of sour cream, hold the cheese, and a dab of guacamole, with my usual ""no, it's not a side order of guac, just a dab.""  And topped with that delicious dressing.  Each bite evoked the Ecstasy of Santa Teresa, until I could eat no more.  Regrettably, I had to leave a few bites in the bowl, I was so stuffed (and anticipating a stop at Yogurtland on the way home).

Unlike my neighborhood Chipotle in New Jersey, where the line stretches out the door early or late no matter what day, this location on Lake Mead was an empty pleasure.  No line, no scramble for a table.  My only complaint was that we should have eaten outside, because I froze the whole time, and it was just a perfect evening temperature right outside the door.  Oh, well, next time.  And there will be a next time.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,0,5,mHNmpJK0tVMLxFH8m_8jvQ

People need to keep in mind that this is still a fast food joint... don't expect a fine dinning experience, this place gets very busy and loud, the servers cant give every single client 120% and hurry the hell up to help and please the next starving client who cant wait to bite into their delicious burritos, bowls, tacos  and quesadillas. 

They serve BEER!!! lol",tL3iZDuWKXP6wh4IOrw62w,2,0,5,wqTg4Yxzva_21kyLmP19vA

Sorry if you don't like your job don't work there no need to be rude to the customers!,agnWS29DVR-8_UpIUJxxMA,2,0,1,Y2I0JmNkOjTccmjHzVNhJQ
