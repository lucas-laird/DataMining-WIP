Usually when I come in though, it's not busy, so I can't attest much for the quality during busy hours, but I never have had issues from the food. The other reviews I've read about this location give it an average rating, so perhaps the dine-in and take-out quality is different? I will keep coming back, due to the convenience and my experiences here. I don't like eating in casino food courts anyways, so I'll keep carrying-out. Friendly staff.

Tried to call in an order and was literally placed on hold for over 15 minutes. I purposely waited patiently thinking, ""Ok, they must be busy. Someone will pick up and courteously ask me to remain on hold for a bit longer."" NO, didn't happen. Not even once. 

I hung up and called right back, and before I could greet her again I was getting ready to be automatically placed on hold again until I yelled out, ""Wait! I've already been on hold for 15 minutes. Can you please just take my order real quick. I know what I want. It's simple."" Angela said she was the only one there with a line out the door. Well, if she had taken my order over the phone within the first 5 minutes of holding, or told me that they couldn't take phone orders at that time, I could have driven over & had my food within the same time frame that I was placed on hold. She wanted to place me on hold for another 15 minutes until she got her line taken care of. WTH!

They need to have more cashiers during rush hour or close phone hours during that time. Something has to give in the name of Customer Service. How many orders did they miss by not having someone there to take phone orders only during rush hour, 5pm on a Monday? Many!

As far as food...
Tried the Atomic Hot, and those are just ridiculously hot for no reason. No flavor...just way beyond habanero spicy, like they picked every possible super spicy herb & said ""Just throw it on there"". Sauce dropped on my arm and literally whelped my skin. Even my finger tips burned from the sauce. o.O No Bueno!

Tried the Chile Lime...tastes like they just used Taco Seasonings with a splash of lime. They were okay, but I was in the mood for chicken wings, not tacos. Palette was confused.

I guess the best thing to do is to Keep It Simple...Lemon Pepper & Original Hot...Plus choose a location that has better customer service. Which means, I probably won't be eating Wingstop anytime soon because I'm not driving across town to another location. My hubby's homemade Lemon Pepper & Hot Wings are AWESOME! We just didn't feel like greasing up the kitchen this evening.",2_J0EaiiCP0kvtqRYty1oQ,0,0,1,CQ9S33EzKmj14PHqVoLPHA

They shorted us on a ton of sauce even though I selected 4 orders of the 100 packs. I honestly think they were rushing from mismanaging time due to how much was short. They do not disclose that they use Uber Eats for delivery, so what we though would be an on time delivery for a work event was, instead, a 30 minutes late delivery since the driver had to take multiple orders. That is how long our staff's lunches are. It had a major, negative impact on the purpose of the whole event since it left everyone complaining rather than being happy. Do not order from them unless it's nothing more than a personal order or 2. They will ruin it.",c5JSY6iwwi1WhsdR0nSRXg,0,0,2,SoAoYNmJHNHtbp5UzFLnHQ

It might be the fact that I am spoiled with Buffalo Wild Wings. but whenever I go to a wing place, i go for garlic parm wings. there wasn't enough garlic butter and too much parmesan. I am a cook at an authentic italian place. and when they brought out the bag of parmesan, i became a harsh critic, that had doubts from the get-go.It seems unfair, but we get our parm in a form of a 50lb wheel, and freshly grate it our self, So i might be a bit spoiled. anyways, the chicken was average, and the sauce was just not that good. the fries were though. For what wing stop is, i think it is average. It's a fast food wing place, that has reasonable prices.

No matter what location I come to, Wingstop's wings are always crispy, juicy, and flavored to perfection. The fries are hand cut pair deliciously with ranch. Or sometimes if I'm wanting a lighter option, I'll order all celery sticks as a side in lieu of fries.

Then 20-30 minutes later, our food was ready and they messed up which sauce I chose on my wings. I don't do spicy and they gave me mild instead of garlic.

I'm new to this area of town so I actually had to ask the lady on the phone how to get there and the best place to park. She was extremely nice and gave great directions. I didn't catch her name but I really appreciated her patience in answering my question. So thank you!!! 

Ok, back to the food. I placed my take out order of a Family Pack with 24 wings, veggies, and a large fry. I'm really weird and always order my chicken wings plain and just get the sauce on the side. So don't think my wings looks weird in the picture. My veggies were fresh and delicious. I actually enjoy eating nice crisp celery and carrots with my wings. I swear this place has the best ranch ever! I always order a large ranch and just use the left over on my salads during the week. 

The only reason I docked this place a star was because my fries were not cooked all the way and still slightly raw. I think they forgot to season them as well. Next time I will just mention it over the phone so they know and see what happens. 

Overall great spot, friendly staff, and delicious food.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,2,2,4,XFAiaSdUb5aSe3IeLEbmDw

It had a great flavor but wasn't really spicy to me. Usually when I order wings at other locations I have to order them extra crispy, but I didn't at this location. 

I was very say satisfied with my order and I will return soon.",qMmP-83xP6jg_hJ3vpbnug,0,0,5,sjt6LPQ9BrPnEsl6wDvs3g

My family loves wingstop chicken wings....... I HATE dealing with wingstop employees.
Yesterday we called to place an order, they put us on hold for over 10 minutes and never came back to the phone so we decided on something else for dinner.

Tonight..... thought I would by pass the phone and order on line.

Ordered at 6:30.... 30 wings for pick up, online ordering said it would be ready at 6:55
Got there at 6:55, called to have them bring out the food(curb-side pick up)..... again placed on hold... waited.... waited.. finally went in.... was told my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes.
I really hate to be a b*tch.... there was no one in line.....6-7 employees wandering around behind the counter...... 3 people in the corner of the restaurant that already had their food.
Why in the world was I even placed on hold.....6 employees and no one can answer a phone call? Why wasn't the food ready...... 45 minutes to cook 30 wings???????
These employees obviously have no desire to work. Hoping you don't call in an order.

It is really sad that a place that has such good food has such horrible service. I hope the owner of Wingstop in the Santa Fe reads this...... we would love to be regular customers! Your employees make us want to never come back!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,4,0,1,vX73tLwBukNxU-TvsrrFEw

 Just recently I ordered for delivery using their 25 boneless wings for $15.00 special, and I wasn't disappointed. Everything came hot, fresh and still very crispy! They for sure have a returning customer!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,0,0,4,3PTAejy-x4wSHVNKcFffwQ

I tried the Hot, Garlic Parmesan, and BBQ this time...all sauced up and tasty.  TOO much sauce actually...I was scraping the BBQ sauce off, since it was poured so thick lol.  Better too much than not enough I guess.

The wings are cooked perfectly, juicy, and flavorful.  Really enjoy their fries here...cut up home style with the skins....yum :)

A little spendy though...think we spent around $24 for 24 wings and some fries.  Almost $1 each at that rate with no drinks.

Gotta pay to play I guess!  At least while you're in Sante Fe :P",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,0,4,SuMuQOcDjH4JJheJWDXyBQ

I'm a huge Buffalo Wild Wings fan so I was a little hesitant to try Wing Stop at first. This WS happened to be located inside the Sante Fe Station and for a Sunday night it was busy. If your looking for a variety of flavors, you're not going to find that here. They have about 7 basic flavors and if you get an order of 15 wings, you can only mix and match TWO. Kinda lame. So anyway, I tried the Parmesan and original style hot. The Parmesan was ""good"" and the original tasted like it was tossed in Tabasco sauce and I wasn't very impressed. The quality of chicken is OK, I've definitely had better. I thought it was a bit pricey for the amount they give you and the quality. 

So for now BDubbs is still my fave, but Wings Stop is not a terrible place to stop by when you're hungry and in the mood for wings. I will however give them another shot just to try the other flavors... :)",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,3,0,3,-P7wNpEyj_2P2dtsT9hb-A
5285155,2014-02-10,0,A2pZTpFXWC38z506XIhnBQ,Wing stop is a great wings fix. They are quick about their orders and the menu is simple. I always get the boneless wings in the original Louisiana rub. Wings always come out crispy and flavorful. The portions and size of the wings are exception and I could not complain. They are like a fast good restaurant for wings and it's great.

The size of the individual wings are very substantial indeed, but the taste and texture is what captivated me. The lemon pepper wings have a lofty balance of salty and crispy while still offering flavor. The teriyaki wings were quite tasty too, but the lemon pepper was by far the star performer. It takes about 10 minutes to cook once you place your order, so don't go if you're in a rush. They also have a nice garlicky ranch dipping sauce that's worth trying as well.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,1,2,4,wLdZ6Ozl1QZXTIqomJefoQ

Chicken wings are NOT boneless  sauces don't come with , you have to pay extra...this is not fast food!  sauces not free! hehe and it does takes about 12minutes after you order because it's fried to order. once in a lucky while, they will miscount and you get an extra wing! maybe making up for the size of wings? sometimes they are smaller than usual.

It's great to have this location so close except for the fact that it's in the casino and you have to park and walk to it. So ordering from home takeout can be a little humbug but if your craving for the wings you do what you have to do! sometimes after we watch a movie we have a craving we will order out. or we eat before going to the movies. 

It's nice when my sister and brother used to stay here, because they also loved these wings and would bring them over for dinner. now they stay at Red Rock where there isn't a wingstop. but then again, they also opened up in Hawaii now, so it's not as special to them.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,0,0,5,iuqaSoCq8NUxnR9zq4izIw

Service: The people working at this location is a hit or miss. Sometimes they're super nice to you, and sometimes it's like they've got a couple of chicken bones up their booties. However, 65% of the time that I've been here they have been very nice and accommodating especially since I order A LOT of wings to take home to my family.

Food: Umm, well.. This place used to super amazeballs. It was so amazebally good that I picked this place over BWW. Never again, unfortunately. Their boneless wings are super salty. I wanted to throw 'em away. And their classic wings don't have enough sauce on them and are also a bit too much on the salty side. My favorite sauce however is Hickory smoked BBQ. Those are almost always delicious. 

Overall: Two stars. One star for the service, and an added star for their BBQ-flavored wings.",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,0,0,2,0lpCFKmA6VVwL3CNy-Z-yA

There was nothing really horrible about it, it just wasn't great. I ordered the 6 boneless wings combo with 1/2 lemon pepper and 1/2 mango habanero. First of all, we were in line FOREVER. There were only 2 people ahead of us, but the service was incredibly slow. My friend ordered first, but for some reason I received my food first - it was really strange.

We were told it would take about 12 minutes for our orders to be ready.....it was closer to 20 and as I mentioned above, my food was ready before hers, even though she ordered a good 5 minutes before me. The kitchen looked to be really disorganized and a lot of employees were socializing instead of working. 

The flavor of the wings wasn't that great either. Overall, it just missed the mark and I am glad that I live so far away that I won't have any desire to drive across town to hit this location.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,0,1,2,FLpCbJgi4KTAya49USCCVA

They are ok, but kinda small for the price. He don't seem to mind how much they are. He usually orders 30 hot and 20 medium both with extra sauce and he would also order fries too.
Being in the casino I am sure they are higher priced than if you went to a regular wing stop but I have no idea.
Customer service behind the counter we have always found to be friendly even when getting refills on drinks you have to walk back to the counter and ask for it.
The flavor of the sauce is good, as I said the only negative is the wings are smaller than some places we have been.
