The Asian chicken with noodles was especially good. Pity we live in England otherwise this would be a real favourite of ours! Highly recommended.,zhbbwhOqEfUqjpmsbGEIMA,0,0,5,pcKYczJt05aBOccB3mxOOw

Spiced breading, a fab sauce, so tender! Could eat it every wk. Lobster pot stickers, divine... again sauce is wonderful! The beef sliders are heavenly. The steak skewers were tender but did not take me like the other items. First trip our margarita's had to be sent back for additional agave syrup sweetening but second trip different bartender and they were great. First trip we entered, went to the patio and then had to call the restraurant asking for service and a menu. It was not busy so there was no excuse for poor service. Trip 2 they seem to have corrected this. Will be going again for the food. Friends did the Prix Fixe menu and said it was screaming good.",wef1zAZ4hEbhLIftQ5xqZg,0,0,5,e-sVEb0WAtFb4SV1ZsGH6Q
144806,2012-05-19,0,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"Roy's recently changed their Aloha Hour menu (everyday, 4:30-6:30 pm) in their bar/patio area, so we stopped by to try some of their new dishes.  We love coming and enjoying some small bites and drinks on the patio for $5 each.  The portions are quite small, but the flavors are always good and the ingredients fresh.  We had the smoked mahimahi tacos and korean beef short rib tacos.  They come 3 to an order, and each is served in a little taro chip (see pictures).  The korean short rib was very tender and had incredible flavors, wish I could have just eaten a large serving of the meat itself as an entree :)  The smoked mahimahi reminded me of smoked salmon in flavor, and came topped with a jalapeño herb puree.  Both were delicious!  We also had our favorite, the tempura crusted spicy ahi roll and a new sushi roll, the big island ebi roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, mango, topped with a habanero aioli).  The combination of flavors in the ebi roll were quite good, but the serving of shrimp inside was practically non-existent.  I noticed too that the spicy ahi roll has considerably decreased in size, there used to be a much bigger portion and more ahi inside.  In the past we've had the wagyu beef sliders and the lobster potstickers, which were just okay.  

The drinks are quite a good deal during the aloha hour.  All of their well and cocktail drinks are $5, Kona fire rock ale is $3, and they also have wines by the glass for $5.  My favorite drink there is the pineapple-ginger mojito, but they no longer have it on the menu (they now have a mango mojito).  

When we have dined in the main dining room, my favorite appetizer is the Szechuan baby back ribs...they literally fall off the bone and are so flavorful.  The misoyaki butterfish is always a good choice for an entree.  I would not recommend the caramelized scallops, the texture is unappetizing and the dish seriously lacks flavor.  The Roy's melting chocolate soufflé is good, as is the pineapple upside down cake to end your meal.  Service is great in the dining room, we came for our anniversary one time and they printed out a menu with our names on it and gave us a complimentary mini dessert...what a nice touch!  However, most of the entrees are in the high 20 to 30 dollar range, and for our money we'd rather enjoy the small plates for $5.",8euCyEtOwwtPw_sJ2VEeRg,1,1,4,C-ga-wP40UuoCJBpE51RAw
152360,2012-01-31,1,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"We have been here numerous times, but this review will focus on their Aloha Hour (happy hour) menu. This was previously one of our favorite places for happy hour. Sadly, things have gone downhill. Food items and cocktails from their bar menu are only $5 each, but value for your dollar varies depending on what you get. This time we got two orders of kobe sliders with sweet potato fries, calamari, filet mignon skewers with kimchi, tempura crusted spicy ahi tuna roll, and a passion fruit / mango sangria. The sliders were nice and juicy, but we didn't really care for the switch to a pretzl bread bun. The fries were solid but had too little of the truffle oil essence that they used to have. The calamari was the exception and an improvement over past iterations. There was a copious amount of meaty calamari tossed with an Asian soy and macadamia nut vinaigrette. The calamari at the bottom of the bowl got a bit soggy though. The skewers/kimchi were mediocre and very forgettable. The ahi tuna roll had very little tuna and was mostly rice. In the past, I've enjoyed Roy's various cocktails, but the sangria was a complete miss. The cocktail appeared devoid of any of the advertised passion fruit / mango puree. The description also mentioned a bunch of fruit but I only got 2 blueberries and an orange slice garnish.

To add insult to injury, service was inattentive despite the bar area being slow. Our water glasses sat completely empty for almost 10 minutes because our server was too busy chatting up the bartender. Eventually she came by to clear some our plates after which she still did not refill our water until we specifically asked her to.

Mediocre food + mediocre service = unlikely to return anytime soon. It's really a shame because we used to really like this place.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,1,2,2,6d659IUO-EOUO0HSym59jw
161851,2013-03-15,0,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"Having dinner at Roy's was an AMAZING experience and I would rate it at 4.5 stars. 

I was there with a large party (8 people) and a child. The service is amazing, with a very attentive wait staff. I was a little hesitant to eat here because I have a 1 year old daughter but they had a high chair all ready to go. Their ""Keikei"" (kids) menu was fabulous and it came with a chef's hat!! The chef even sent over an ice cream sundae for my daughter as a treat for being so good. How awesome is that?!

I got a free martini for my yelp check-in and it was STRONG! The food is amazing!! I got the salmon and it was wonderful, some of the other items ordered by my group was the filet, the scallops, the mahi mahi, all were delicious. My husband order the calamari appetizer as an entree and the waiter asked him a few questions and he received an amazing custom calamari and noodle entree! The desserts were also great! We had the mango cobbler, which was sweet but not over powering and the nut tart was great too!

The reason for the 4.5 stars is because in the bathroom they had these small square wicker-ish baskets as the trash cans, they didn't have lids or anything so you could see everything that was in them. I just thought it was really odd and a not what I expected from that caliber of a restaurant. 

Overall the whole experience was great and I would highly recommend Roy's to others and I can't wait to go back!",UJkAtZ6014cLFVXNmhYUWA,0,0,5,-eZ4VadK1KK83SCLQzp79Q

It was very personal.  The food was amazing and the drinks were well mixed and delicious!

530849,2009-09-10,1,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"finished up restaurant week 2009 with a light but solid pre fixe $30 dinner at Roy's Fusion Restaurant. The bonus? The contribution they make to 3square.org.  Didn't try anyone else's dishes but i chose the appetizer trio of shrimp, pork shortribs and more pork (szechuwan style), came also with a trio of sauces. i was licking my fingers just to savor every last bit.It was a tossup choosing between my favorites:  the pecan crusted rainbow trout or the herb crusted shrimp. chose the latter and glad i did. they served it with a mushroom and lobster risotto that was divine (lick fingers, check, now lick plate! check)  2 friends got the maui onion sirloin and multi spiced pork chop and raved about them. The perfect wine pairing i had was a glass of mer soleil from ca, not a wine connoisseur myself, but it tasted citrusy with a slight smoky flavor.  i was so proud that i picked it myself.  dessert was the perfect fluff end to dinner, delicately light, upside pineapple cake with homemade coconut infused vanilla ice cream. sorry, no pics to share, i gobbled it up at warp shutter speed.

For what it is, can't wait to go back to try their regular menu; even if it's a chain. Service was timely, the food was worth every penny, and the proceeds went to a great cause.  All considered, a well-rounded 5 stars.",01prx46XR0mMJpNjpGeS6Q,1,0,5,EsNL9oqXmIHHNH9tCs2ecQ
684407,2012-01-12,0,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"Wow, for some reason i walked into the restaurant thinking that I would be giving a four star review. So even more impressed that they won me over recieving 5 stars. 
The restaurant is as described hawain fusion. 
Amazing Fish dishes combined with american staples like a pork chop or filet. 
I chose a Fish sampler. I would Always take three mini entrees over 1 large entre any day. All three pieces of Fish were Cooked diferently and perfectly. 

The best part of the night was the service. I could tell the Server was new and nervice. Learned later that he recently worked his way up though the ranks. He stumbled with the wine work. At first in was like ""i can't believe he can't open a bottle of wine"". But he quickly demonstrated humility and was forthcoming with his lack of experience opening wine. I quickly went from criticing to cheering for the guy. During the entire meal our server went above and beyond. The restaurant manager checked in yet did not smother. 

There was an above average amount of specialty drinks. Wine list had everything you needed with a nice range of prices. I Especially appreciated the options at the lower price points. 

It was mentioned that today was a new menu so if you have not stopped in for a while now may be the time for a return visit.",nZL5W1S_pKBV7bmzNr6b9g,0,2,5,U809St5E0CrO4Ebn6PRv8w

We had checked out the menu online but when we arrived, at least one option that was listed online (for restaurant week) was not listed. I asked the waiter and he asked the chef. They said it would be no problem, and I was thrilled since that was the reason I had wanted to try Roy's out in the first place. 

Service was a tiny bit slower than we are used to but I felt very well taken care of despite it being slow, plus it gave us time to just sit back and enjoy the evening. Everything we tried was amazing. Highlights of the evening: lobster pot stickers, misoyaki butterfish, and the chocolate soufflé ... Omg so delicious. I'm getting hungry again just thinking of it.

I NEED to come here more often because: Butterfish.

OMG, they do a great butterfish.  They also do a great blackened ahi.  Actually, in general, they do great fish.  It's always perfectly prepared and fresh tasting.  Much love to the Roy's chefs on that.

I generally stick to the fish but I have had the chocolate souffle.  The souffle is a lick-your-plate-clean kind of dish.  Warm, dark chocolate souffle topped with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream.  What's not to like?

Service is generally fast and friendly and they give you free edamame. Yeah, it's a chain, but for what they do, they do it well.

Most of their food is wild caught so if you are pregnant the menu has only a few options for you to enjoy. The restaurant is small and intimate.

992368,2011-08-30,1,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"We've had a GC since christmas and figured restaurant week was a good time to use it. We've never been to Roy's since we tend to stray from chains, but I have heard good things so it seemed promising.

We chose the following from the $50.11 Restaurant Week menu:

First Course
Panko Crisped Calamari with Macadamia Nuts, Orange Chili Glaze & Yuzu Aioli and Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs. 

Second Course
Shellfish Sampler; Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail, Seared Crab Cake, U10 Sea Scallop & Shrimp with Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto and Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. 

Third Course
Mascarpone Cheesecake with Coconut Crust, Lemon Crème Anglaise & Blueberry Syrup and Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé with Raspberry Sauce & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

We both felt ""meh"" about the whole experience. Service was discombobulated, I made a reservation but they couldn't find it. They were slow to attend to us at first. We were also seriously distracted by the family behind us, they thought it was a good idea to keep their kiddo occupied by watching cartoons on an iPad. Fine if you have earphones, but not acceptable otherwise especially when average checks are $50 per person.

As for the meal, we enjoyed the edamame to start. It's such a great alternative to bread. Our appetizers were ok. The calamari was very tender, but there was a hint of seasoning I didn't care for it was sweet and bitter. My husband didn't mind it as much. The ribs had a nice char and good flavor, but they were tough and had too much gristle. The  shellfish sampler was terrible. All of it was overcooked, and the flavor was poor. Majority has hardly edible, and the risotto was no better. I definitely chose the better entree. It was overcooked, but otherwise I thought it was decently executed. Desserts didn't impress either. The souffle was chalky. The highlight was the ice cream. My cheesecake was passable, but I really only enjoyed the blueberry syrup.

Not the best way to kick off restaurant week, but on the other hand it set the bar pretty low. I feel like it can only get better.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,0,2,2ObuBt2FqHF30SFOB0hy8w

The restaurant was not what I thought it would be. It was more of clean lines, dark wood bar, open kitchen. Maybe the bastardized Hawaiian theme was in my head, but that definitely wasn't it. Once seated our server promptly greeted us.  The menu has a wide range of menu options starting with sushi, then appetizers and entrees. I was going to order a few pieces of sushi but quickly changed my mind when I saw they had Kobe carpaccio. I was let down though when I saw the portion. The measly bits of beef were hidden by a mound of arugula. The dish was disappointing. My entree of Macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi with lobster sauce was fantastic. Every ingredient on the dish balanced perfectly together from the sweetness of the fish and the nuts and the lightness of the sauce...it was all perfect. I passed on dessert but was given tastes of those who did order and Roy's sorbet was a perfect ending to the meal. A trio of sorbet of Lychee, Mango and Coconut had perfect texture. 

The server did forget one of my friends dishes but quickly made up for it. Besides that one hiccup we never waited for a thing and service was always prompt.

Not like Planet Hollywood were we could have purchased the same thing for 10 bucks...LOL. Of course that's a tourist trap...but still it's worth to compare things that could be considered equal. The food was great too but it was not as good as during my first visit. It was slightly salty (I had the salmon with the goat cheese and spinach crust). However the service was top notch and the experience was pleasant and memorable. And I got my little birthday cake surprise as well. Our baby girl got also a cute little dessert with a sundance scoop and a bit of chocolate. I am sure we probably would have paid big bucks at Roebuchon for it...Great!

Roasted corn and sweet potato chowder was excellent. The corn kernels were tender, sweet and crisp. A sweet and warm soup for the soul. 

My entree was the Hawaii Kai beef short ribs. Very tender beef with a sweet soy sauce marinade, topped with bits of onion and red pepper made for a tasty dish. 

Finally dessert was Haupia creme puffs. The Haupia, a coconut pudding, had a very subtle flavor. i would have preferred a stronger coconut flavor and something sweeter.

At first the menu looks a tad on the pricey side but the food is well worth it.

Appetizers
 - Panko Crusted Calamari -
Recommended by our server. Not a traditional Calamari with deep fried squid goodness served next to some tomato based sauce, this variation of Calamari comes lightly breaded, deep fried, and tossed in a sweet orange sauce with a mild vinegar tang. Absolutely delicious.

Salads
 - Maui Wowie - 
10 bucks for a salad? Better be the best salad ever... Yeah it's really good. The caper lime dressing wasnt too rich but wasnt too light either, it was perfectly balanced and gave each ingredient enough room to pronounce itself. Sweetness of the shrimps compliment the salad very nicely.

Entrees 
- Roy's Trio - 
Beautifully arranged on the three tiered plate this trio of fish is well worth the price. The salmon was cooked perfectly and had a very pleasant grilled flavor. The tuna's butter sauce was...DAMN!!

1996573,2010-12-10,1,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"Oh Roy's I always forget how delicious you are!

I've been to my share of Roy's restaurants (Michigan, Florida, Nevada...) and I can't believe I have never written a review!

Start with the calamari and end with the melting hot chocolate soufflé.  I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

They have an excellent Prix Fixe Menu that changes with the season and it was very ""autumn"" right now so nothing caught our eyes.  But if you see that you like it- its the best price way to go!

So, here is what we had:
- Panko Crisped Calamari
- Lakanilau (sushi you will NOT find anywhere else!!)
- Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi (x 2 as my husband had it as well!)
- Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé

My husband and I are calamari snobs, if you will, because we love calamari and we always like to try it at various places.  Roy's definitely turned into our favorite.  So you know when you order calamari at places and you get the rings and something like looks like the claws?  I hate the ""claw"" looking pieces.  Well at Roy's- no rings and no ""claws""!  They are just perfect, meaty pieces of calamari, perfectly cooked with a perfect coating of panko.  They come with a delicious chili glaze & Yuza ailoi.  We could have eaten that as our main course!

The Lakanilau has wagyu beef, snow crab, asparagus, avocado, sesame miso and truffled greens.  I am like only the only person in the world that has JUST RECENTLY (like in the past 3 weeks!) tried sushi.  And I loved it!  Nothing too crazy though.  This was the ""craziest"" I have tried.  And its not even crazy!  But I have never seen this on another menu and it was VERY good!  The wagyu beef was insane!

I've had the Macadamia nut crushed mahi mahi a many times at Roy's and its my favorite thing.  Its a VERY generous piece of mahi mahi with asparagus and a few potatoes. Yum!  I know i'm not going into great detail, but I'm sure its gotta be one of the most popular items on the menu.  

Now, if you leave Roy's without trying the Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé, you need to be slapped.  I'm not kidding.  This is my favorite part of the dinner, even though everything else is fabulous.  You need to tell your server (they usually ask when you are placing your order) that you will want the chocolate soufflé.  The soufflé has this melting chocolate part in the middle, that when it comes to the table, you need to break it open and have it ooze over the vanilla bean ice cream and the raspberry sauce.  All of these flavors do a beautiful dance on your tongue and you will be smiling the entire time you are eating it.

My parents used to sit at the bar, so they could watch the chefs making the dinners, sushi and soufflé and they always said it was the best part of their dinner.

The dinner ran us about $150, including two glasses of wine, but it was well worth the price for this incredible dinner.

Total side note: My cousin was a manager at an Outback in Hawaii and Roy's was the only other restaurant on the island.  Roy was always there and he said how nice and down to earth guy Roy was.  Knowing that, makes me want to eat there even more!

When they seat you, they ask if you are celebrating a special event.  And here's why: when it's someone's birthday (I think there were 3 there last night!) they bring out a dessert and take the table's photo.  Before you leave, then bring it out in Roy's frame for you to take home.  Pretty cool!

The waiter even showed up with a camera, took a group shot of all of us at the table and then came back with the pic and a nice little frame as a memento of the night.  Plus they took those one page additions to our menu and rolled them all up and gave them to her.

Our waiter, Danny, was great and very informative. I couldn't decide on what to order so he literally ordered everything for me from apps to dessert which I thought was a fun surprise each time he brought something to our table. The wine selection is great. We ordered a malbec which was top of the line. The Butter fish is highly recommended here, but wasn't what I expected.

2662665,2013-05-12,2,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: Stay away from the sushi rolls and you will be one happy camper.  They also have an awesome selection of $5-6 food and drink items during their happy hour (4:30-6pm).

THE MEAT: The main reason why I wanted to go to Roy's was I saw on a food show that they have given birth to the seared tuna dish, and that they do it very well.  In spite of being a franchise that has been mushroomed around the world from Hawaii in 1988, and as their serving dishes shall suggest a probable need for presentation updates, they have managed to maintain consistently high reviews from customers.  I was excited to try it for the very first time.

Aside from the very cute (colored) coloring comic book, the first pleasant surprise was a free nibbling platter they handed my toddler as soon as we were settled with our drinks - Cheese quesadillas, carrots, celery, apples and a ranch dip.  I ADORE places that pay attention to these details in cheering up the customers.  

We ordered the Ahi Poke (pretty good, but the nori chips had sat out too long and were chewy), the Schezuan spiced pork ribs (fatty, tender and tasty goodness), the Ebi roll topped with tuna (they had unfortunately discontinued Auntie Lei's Roll with hamachi, and this was what the waiter had suggested... although the shrimp was large and fresh, it was still quite disappointing.. stick to sushi joints for sushi rolls), the Mai Tai (was excellent, the cocktails on the other tables looked damn good as well), and finally the Blackened Ahi.  We ordered the appetizer portion and when it came out, it didn't look very pretty.  But one bite of the tuna with the spiced crust and sweet/salty sauce and I was in heaven.  It was a large piece of good tuna, only ever so slightly spiced and seared, and it was perfection.  Well, we had to ask for extra dipping sauce to achieve nirvana.

We had no more room to try the butterfish and chocolate soufflé.  Definitely good reasons to go back, together with repeats for the Blackened Ahi.  And perhaps an abuse of the happy hour with a group of friends.

I'M STILL DIGESTING... The fact that the interiors of the main dining area was uberly dim.  Makes me feel like I'm in an 80s restaurant.  Good for hiding zits or mistresses.  We stayed in the beautiful porch outdoors.

Hubby & I ate here this past Saturday for our 10yr anniversary.  They personalized our menu with an anniversary wish.  We ordered their calamari appetizer, which was A-MAY-ZING!  It was marinated in some sort of soy-ginger marinade and drizzles with some sort of sauce.  for our entrees, hubby ordered the fish trio, which consisted of salmon, mahi mahi, & butterfish, each prepared differently from one another.  I had the shellfish sampler- (1) lobster tail, (2) prawns (1) crab cake, & (1) large scallop on top of a bed of risotto.  It was very yummy.  The downfall from each plate:  the portion of the fish trio was small for it to be priced at $34; the crab cake was nothing special.  I've tasted better ones at Yard House.  I would have given Roy's 5 stars, but my glass of wine was filled only a quarter of my glass & my Mai Tai was a bit too lime-y for my taste, and our chocolate souffle was over baked- the chocolate didn't ooze out when we broke into it.  Service was exceptional though :)
We will definitely be returning.",tmBrer6xi5-vIM8NB6m9HA,0,0,4,RhM-n7dpDVawAudep7DqPw
2778510,2011-07-02,14,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"This is the holy grail of restaurants for parents... a place that is kid-friendly AND has good food. I didn't think it was possible. Based on all the family-friendly spots we've been to, this one has the best food. Now, I don't think it's on par with elite restaurants on the Strip, but it's still very tasty.

What really makes this place special is the value -- a happy hour (from 4:30 - 6:30) where appetizers, wine, and cocktails are $5 and Kona pale ale is $3. They also have a three course prix-fixe menu for $35.

The mixed green salad ($7.95 and not on the HH menu) was respectable, although not the sexiest dish. Both the tempura crusted spicy ahi roll and crunchy lobster potstickers were delicious fusion options worth getting again. The wagyu sliders (2 per order) were tender and juicy and sat on a pretzel-like bun. They were accompanied by garlic sweet potato fries. The biggest letdown was the salt and pepper crisped calamari. While the sweet and spicy flavor was enjoyable and the addition of macadamia nuts was a nice contrast in texture, it was a heavy dish that could have benefited from having the sauce on the side.

The kid menu isn't cheap -- at $13 -- but it does come with three courses. The appetizer is a cheese quesadilla with sliced apples, celery and carrots. There are six kid entrees to choose from. The final course is either a sundae or fresh fruit (guess which one my kid chose).

Another pleasant surprise was the quality of service. From the host and hostess to our waiter and food runners... everyone was warm and welcoming. It's almost commonplace to walk into a ""nice"" restaurant with a child and suffer poor service from employees who don't want you there. So, getting the kind of attention and friendliness that we received was shocking. That level of care will turn us into repeat customers, as there's no doubt we'll be back, whether or not it's for a family night out or a date night.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,27,19,5,s7bKajvB_sLQjfqtQ7LpYQ

First, we ordered the spare ribs for our appetizer. They came out and were tender, but hot on the outside, ice cold on the inside. We sent them back. The manager brought out of fresh order promising to check in on us, but alas never did.

For our entrees, I ordered the yellowtail with risotto. My risotto was crunchy. It wasn't palatable at all, but the fish was good. My wife ordered the boursin-stuffed chicken breast. The skin on the chicken was chewy, not crispy. The flavor of the chicken was lackluster at best. The potato pave side dish was crunchy but not in a good way.

This would have been OK if the service was good. But it wasn't. Our server barely checked in on us. My wife's drink sat empty until we finally put it on the outside of the table. 

We saw other tables that looked like they were having better meals, however our server that night was uninformative and never came to check on us. The only saving grace was that the chocolate souffle was amazing!

Roy's is just an excellent experience for dinner.
I take relatives and out of town friends there.

It is hard to imagine that it is a chain restaurant....

I enjoy everything - the Braised Short Ribs are my # 1 favorite.
They have an excellent Prix Fixe menu that changes slightly throughout the year.
3 courses @ $35.00 - hard to beat that deal for the quality of the food.

The meal is usually completed by the molton chocolate souffle. Everyone enjoys the hot liquid chocolate escaping from the cake when you cut into it. 

Chef Roy Yamaguchi inspires the Hawaiian Fusion cusine served in the many Roy's locations.
The three ""Hawaiian style mixed plates"" along with the seafood choices make dinner selection most difficult.

This restaurant was available back home on Guam, but I never had the time to stop by the hotel and try it.  Last night I was on a quest to find something different to eat, and Roy's fit the bill.

When we walked in, it was like stepping into a restaurant on the Big Island.  Comfortable, dim lighting made for a sophisticated yet comfortable eating atmosphere.  The staff uniforms are simply any island shirt and slacks, which is great because individual personalities stand out for each server.  The menu is just as nice as the atmosphere--short and to the point.  There are specialties that your server will point out to you as well as any suggestions for the evening.  

I suggest their Lakalinau roll--wagyu beef on top of the roll that has termpura asparagus, snow crab, sesame miso and truffled greens.  That blew my mind.  The textures are fabulous and the flavors were amazing together.  All I could say while eating it was ""Oh my God"".  I'm hardly ever into a roll that much, so this surprised me.  

We had sashimi and their rock shrimp tempura which, by the way, was sprinkled with saffron and served with a great peanut sauce.  That was the first time I've ever eaten Indian tempura, so to speak, and it was wonderful.  

Their butterfish is so flaky and full flavored that I wanted to eat all of it, but it was my husband's order.  It has this thai chili sauce on the plate that was mildly sweet and spicy.  Great choice.  I had the macadamia crusted mahi, which was very good, too.  Although more firm than the butterfish and not as flavorful, it was still great.  The asparagus was good on the plate.

Their complimentary edamame has this crazy garlic and spice flavoring that it's tossed in, which I loved.  It reminds me of the same garlic sprinkles that are on top of Beijing Noodle's (at Caesars Palace) crispy chicken.  I love that stuff.

Overall, a great experience and definitely a restaurant I'll frequent more often.  You must try their sushi if you aren't in the mood to spend too much on dinner, and if you are willing to splurge, grab the butterfish, the roll I mentioned, and ask for extra edamame. 

If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I can't say that I'm a fan because the sushi was the only thing that flipped my mind.  The flavors are great here, and the food is good, but their specialty is fish and compared to RM Seafood, this place is just fair.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,2,3,Xe4CEielEVy6QKSNqqog8g

3915114,2010-07-12,0,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"I had thought I had posted a review for Roy's when I dined here last year for Restaurant Week, but I guess I didn't.  That's OK, because I wanted to post a new review after eating here last week for my mom's birthday, and make sure that i gave Roy's 5 stars.

First, I made reservations online, and since my mom has food allergies, I typed some information into the box that asked about it on their site.  It also asked me if we were celebrating a birthday, which we were.

When we arrived, we were seated and discovered that they had a special ""Happy Birthday Susan"" paper printed out and inserted into our menus.  What a cool idea.  After we ordered and they took our menus, they rolled up the papers with a ribbon as a gift.  They also took our picture and printed it out and put it in a paper frame for us to keep.  On top of that, a few different employees stopped by the table to wish her a happy birthday.  No annoying birthday song, but everything Roy's did to celebrate was very classy.

On to the food!  I had their prix fixe menu and had the trout along with a shrimp cake appetizer.  My girlfriend had a shrimp dish, and my mom had the halibut.  We all enjoyed our meals immensely, and the staff brought up my mom's food allergies I had typed in before we mentioned it in person.

For me, it was all a precursor to dessert, though, where I had the chocolate lava cake that came with the prix fixe dinner.  This is simply the best dessert I've ever had, and I'd eat actual lava as a main course just to get to the dessert.  They also brought vanilla bean creme brule with a candle in it for my mom, on the house of course.

Our server Justin was great, as was the rest of the staff at Roy's.  Definitely a place I'll be celebrating special occasions at in the future.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,3,3,5,UDFtdD8vBJwrK8nZ4ofK6Q

It was not overwhelming nor not enough. We even had two complimentary appetizers. This location is more on the quiet side.

3966524,2011-09-12,1,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"Review for Restaurant Week 2011 menu:

Service started with a small bowl of edamame.  Another restaurant that does something than give you a bread basket.  Good idea.

Course 1:  Lobster pot stickers with miso butter sauce.  The pot stickers were grilled perfectly and the plating was nicely done.  I expected a stronger lobster flavor, but it is ground filling so maybe my expectations were too high.  They were very tasty.

Course 2:  Macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi eith lobster essence.  The mahi mahi was tender and soft as it should be and it was moist and cooked perfectly.  There was a base of a small amount of potato puree that held some red potato slices on which the mahi mahi was placed.  It was crowned by asparagus spears.  A fine main course and just the right amount.

Course 3:  Melting hot chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  This isn't a traditional souffle, but it comes close to it.  The melted chocolate inside was very hot and you needed to wait for it to cool before really trying more than the tiniest taste.

Service:  Everyone was great!  When i was seated, I was in the dining room at a table meant for 4 people.  I had noticed the kitchen bar/sushi bar seating when I was going to my table.  I asked the hostess if I could sit there instead and she said, ""You can sit just about anywhere you want.  Come on.""

I like restaurants that have a counter area that overlooks the cooks doing their thing.  I also had a good time talking with a couple of them and they showed me some of the dishes they had made before they were served because they noticed my inquisitive look at what they were doing.  This made the meal all the more enjoyable!

My server was there to ask how each course was after I had chance to try them, and he refilled my iced tea promptly.  Altogether, this was a wonderful dining experience.  I am sure I'll be returning to Roy's.  This RW menu gave me a good taste of their food and the whole experience showed me what they're like.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,1,5,xXb8RoLBtfzbN-dXtezbfg

They honored my YELP check-in offer (wow, what a concept-unlike Nittayas Secret Kitchen) and the Hawaiian Martini was fabulous!  I even ordered it as we were paying our bill and our waiter brought it right away.  He was great!  Very nice, genuine and offered friendly service. He made some excellent recommendations and was gracious  when I told him I didn't like one of the rolls he brought out.  He took it off our bill.

This was my first time at Roy's in Las Vegas, and they brought out some complimentary items for us to try (some edename and pork ribs-yummy).  

I frequented Roy's in Scottsdale quite often so I didn't even open a menu.  The butterfish is always a favorite. I actually had butterfish for the first time in South Africa and it was prepared like its namesake.  When I saw it on Roy's menu and ordered it I knew it would be a marriage made in heaven and I've been ordering it every time I visit.  Tuna roll was very good but I skipped on dessert which is always the Lava cake, because after shopping at Zara's I decided to pass on the extra calories!",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,11,9,5,H7TqK19b5f_NsK1xk6Z6Bw

A previous review said this was a cookie cutter chain. It maybe. I did not explore their corporate structure but it in no way feels like it.

On Monday's they feature a three course meal for $36.95. Appetizer, main course and desert. You can choose from almost any item on the menu to build your meal. If you are a calamari fan, DO NOT MISS the calamari appetizer. We all had Butter Fish as the main course and it was amazing. My favorite of the desserts was the pineapple upside down cake.

Our server was Dan. We gave him the task of choosing what appetizers and desserts to bring. He was spot on. If I owned a restaurant, I would try and steal him away. He was very attentive and helpful.

Remember, when you make Open Table reservations through Yelp, you don't get the dining points.  At least I did not when making my reservation for this location.

I broke one of my biggest dining rules when ordering here, and it cost me.  No excuse that I had been drinking at the pool for 6 hours prior to this meal.  

Rule - never eat seafood unless you can see the ocean.  My scallops were burned on the outside and under-cooked on the inside.  Everything else about the meal, including orders of the rest of my party, was top notch as expected.

So, lesson learned.  Find places via Yelp - Reserve via Open Table - And order something other than seafood in LV.

It was my Mom's 75th birthday.  So we all went as a family affair. 
The waiters were very attentive and handsome but that is all I'm gonna say about them. 
The busboys were on the mark about cleaning up after each course. 
My six-year old niece got special treatement which was great and kept her from getting bored like lil kids usually do. 
Now about the food:
CALAMARI-was ok.  Was kinda wet...don't know if it was the sauce on it or not cooked enough.  Ask for the sauce on the side so you can dip it yourself.  I've had better calamari and the tentacles were missing.
(HOUSE SPECIALTY)-HAWAIIAN MARTINI-on the strong side...tasted good...strong....a wedge of pineapple on the glass...nothing spectacular. 
RIBEYE-I always order medim.  Nice size, tender.  I can taste the burnt parts. It's ok-at least it was really grilled.  Some sauce on it...again...shoulda asked for sauce just on the plate or on the side.  I don't like my food soggy.  Mashed potatoes very buttery...but it was...umm mashed potatoes.  Green beans-tasted like green beans.  I didin't like and I usually like the green beans. The sauce tasted buttery and the rib-eye had an assortment of mushrooms on it.  I love mushrooms but they did not excite my pallette.
My son ordered the BBQ CHICKEN- he was not thrilled with his order.  
My sister ordered the BUTTERFISH-I think she really liked it..especially the sauce.  
My parents ordered the SURF AND TURF-they finished it (either they were really hungry or really liked it! lol)
The menu had a special HAPPY BIRTHDAY greeting inside it for my mom.  Nice touch.  As the dessert came CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE- a special plate for my mom was brought out.  Candles, happy birthday on the plate with chocolate sauce and some cute dainty cupcakes for her.  The souffle was yum.  Hot and melted chocolate inside.  My son described it as a CHOCOLATE LAVA.  

...overall- AMBIENCE:  dark, great place for a date. (too dark for my mom's eyes-she had a hard time reading the menu) 
I liked the fact there was an eating bar overlooking the kitchen and you can see the chefs working their magic. 
...WAITERS-easy on the eyes, attentive
....FOOD-take it or leave it.  Maybe I was expecting too much since I heard so much about this place and it's ""Hawaiian-Fusion"".  

I want a place to ""WOW"" me!. I want to eat something I could not cook at home.  It was a nice place...but it does not get an OMG from me.  Try it for yourself for the experience.",LT1Lsa0zLR7RkPUGsLiy3w,3,1,3,hC6SWmtqs0C6Xa1OJjQ4bw
4451421,2013-06-26,1,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"A delicious ALOHA hour experience. Review is of bar-seating and happy hour only.

Roy's is a chain, but this a chain I can get behind. Food is creative, yet sensible. Selections on the HH menu seem to be well thought-out and executed. I would not mind one bit returning to Roy's for another HH session, nor would I mind returning for a full out meal.

My friend and I dined on a Tuesday afternoon around 5 PM. We sat ourselves at the bar, which was empty, but became full as we passed out time there. Our bartender was congenial and happy with us, except toward the end when he realized I would only be having one cocktail during my time there.

Ordered:

Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos ($6) - A decent little presentation of hard-shelled tacos filled to the brim with Mahi Mahi. I did like the tacos, but wish the fish had been more prevalent. There was quite a bit of some kind of sauce in there that I could have done without and just had the fish. It was still good.

Ahi Roll ($6) - A very nice roll presented on a plate of sauce with wasabi and ginger. Soy sauce and chopsticks were provided. The roll was good enough for me, but I have had better at restaurants that specialize in sushi alone. But do not take that as the roll being disappointing and bad, as it was good and met my expectations.

Wagyu Sliders & Sweet Potato Fries ($) - I shared this with my friend. The slider was delicious. Very juicy and the meat was so incredibly tender. It comes on a pretzel type bread which is presented with great care. The fries were very yummy and a delicious alternative to plain-ol French fries.

Texas Blackberry Lemondrop - Off of their specialty cocktail menu this drink was recommended to me by the bartender. It is a beautiful magenta color served in a martini glass with a mint leaf on top. The drink is very refreshing without a harsh alcohol flavor. I doubt it will get you anywhere near being drunk, but it's still a nice concoction.

Overall: Food, while good was not perfect. However, it is definitely high ranking. The bartender's service was also pleasant and I believe my friend and I had a nice time here. The lighting is a bit dim, but once you're inside for a bit you do adjust.

Their workers were totally friendly and attentive. Based on my observations, I conclude that it attracts Summerlin housewives and retirees who love to slurp on pink drinks and wine. Bravo TV, if you plan on casting for the Real Housewives of Las Vegas, come here. They're botox and Louis Vuitton ready, trust. Anyway, I recommend their sliders, lobster potstickers and tempura tuna roll. I'm unfamiliar with their drink menu to recommend anything because I stuck to wine. I saw only one beer though.

For entrees we ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi which came overcooked and desperately needing seasoning.  I returned that dish and received a second attempt, which unfortunately was undercooked and still tasteless :(.  
The second entree ordered were the short ribs.  These also came overcooked, chewy but had a slight flavor present...close but no cigar.  

My two children had the shrimp sushi roll off the kids menu. Let's just say they were hungry when we returned home.  Bland, tasteless and just all around careless cooking.

4973755,2009-09-09,0,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"Roy's Aloha Hour was the newest addition this summer to this Asian-Fusion restaurant hailing from Hawai'i.  On Mondays through Fridays, from 4:30 pm to 7 pm, $5 menu items for drinks and food are available.

Of course, when we arrived the past Friday we didn't know about this special hour.  So our dinner reservations (celebrating Restaurant Week) turned into a happy hour feast.

Taking a seat outside to enjoy the warm late summer evening, we looked over the drink menus.  With quite a selection, we began with:
  
* 1988 ""A tribute to our opening year in Honolulu.  Perfectly balanced blend of tart grapefruit and tangy pomegranate with ABSOLUT Ruby Red Vodka, SOHO Lychee Liqueur and Patron Citronge Liqueur echoes the idyllic island lifestyle."" (HH $5) - Delicious.  This was the Husband's drink choice and I didn't give it a second thought because it had grapefruit in it.  However, I caught a whiff of the lychee and couldn't resist taking a sip.  It was good, without the bitterness of grapefruit.  For my second drink and his, we both ordered one of these.

* Mango Mojito ""Fresh mango puree blended with Bacardi Limon Rum, hand-squeezed lime juice and freshly muddled mint."" (HH $5)
* Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich ""Garlic Parmesan Fries"" (HH $5) - This was my first drink choice and it was decent.  It wasn't as great as the 1988 though.

Food bites:

* Chicken & Shitake Mushroom Lettuce Wraps ""Chili Hoisin Dipping Sauce"" (HH $5) - A generous portion of bibb lettuce leaves and stuffing sat in a three sectioned platter along with the dipping sauce.  It probably could have been presented a bit better.  The lettuce wraps were okay, a bit too sweet though.  The Husband found it to be rather mushy, and I would have to be agree.  Not the highlight from this menu.

* Crispy Mochiko Chicken Bites ""Madras Curry Aioli"" (HH $5) - Served in a bamboo steamer, a generous portion of chicken and dipping sauce arrived.  I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty chicken and the sauce complemented it nicely.  

* Spicy Tuna Roll ""Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Kaiware"" (HH $5) - A simple roll cut into 8 pieces, but very good.  They do their sushi rice well here.  We ordered another one.

* Japanese Shishito Peppers ""Sweet Su Miso Sauce"" (HH $5) - A surprise and delightful find.  We've had this elsewhere, but it was so much better here.  So good we ordered another.  I didn't use the dipping sauce, rather I dipped it back in the sauce it came in.

* Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich ""Garlic Parmesan Fries"" (HH $5) - Sliced into two triangles, the sandwich looked exciting from across the table.  Then I noticed the bread, it's a lot thicker and softer, and I prefer it crispier as well.  The shredded cheese wasn't melted all the way, which I think contributed to the lack of gooeyness one expects from a grilled cheese sandwich.  I didn't even notice the pork in the sandwich as a result.  The fries were good though.

Service was okay, not as stellar as I have expected from the Roy's chain though.

LONGER Version:

I went there to try out its happy hours three times; twice on Sats and once on a Fri evening.

I was impressed with its nice bar menu, drinks, and attentive, friendly servers, as well as their setup (table cloth in the cozy patio) for happy hour. Roy's has a small and comfortable bar area inside, as well as a patio with table clothed tables outside for HH. All food and drinks are $5. My friends and I really loved their Cabinet Sauvignon (nice Rutherford), seasoned tender fried calamari, beef sliders, and ahi dishes! They are of great value.

Roy's lives up to its reputation for happy hours. So, I was really surprised that on those occasions, this place was NOT crowded - nothing compared with Gordon Biersch or Kona Grill in Boca Park a mile away, which would have been swamed with young people at happy hours.
- Therefore, if you enjoy delicious foods and drinks and want to have a QUIETER atmosphere for happy hour, then do give Roy's a try! Parking is easy; it also has valet parking, if needed.

When we were leaving near 7pm, we saw the dinner crowd coming in, and the parking lot was getting busy. SoI guess Roy's might be more famous for their dinners than happy hours. But my friends and I found Roy's happy hour to be among our top choices at any rate, ESPECIALLY WHEN we do NOT want having to fight/wait for a table or parking space, and like to enjoy our good foods, drinks and conversation in a quieter setting.

5304237,2007-02-08,0,CWNMLT-ppaUjLMmrnYDPVg,"I won't go into all the details of Roy's. It's a chain and while the menu varies from place to place - it doesn't vary all that much. I personally love the chain It's got great hawaiin and asian-fusion food with ""americanized"" accents. They make great drinks...even the arnold palmer here tastes better than in other places.

But let me focus on this one in Summerlin for a minute. The two or three times I went, the service was pretty sharp. The location is great only if you happen to live or be staying in Summerlin. It's a bit of trek for tourists from the Strip. It stays fairly quiet inside which is nice and a bit of a change from most other members of the chain. No smoking except in the bar - which is a plus (this is Nevada after all).",KKdBQXnUlVUZ0ZNTfMQoEA,1,0,4,3LfBF4dfJZW9Nbs_o64GVA

We ordered the prixe fix menu and were dazzled by the display of each prepared item. This is definitely one of those rara-shishi type places where the portions are small, but the taste more than makes up for it. I returned here for happy hour with a coworker and we enjoyed some unusual (Strawberry Basil Martini) yet delicious cocktails and noshed on appetizers that were much easier on the pocket than the dinner menu. The only issue would be that the happy hour crowd here is more of an older bunch, but if you're just looking for some gourmet eats and delectable drinks this is your place.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,1,4,id1noL6TnJjt7ObdajwWew

The place was pretty dead and they are obviously just hanging on... very sad to see when Flemings right next door is jam packed.  Better food and some personality behind the bar would work wonders. We would only return for the calamari and there is better elsewhere.,g4yPg9CHRbl25q7qcV1wGQ,0,0,1,G0oDO_YSkaHKq49ZmnR2RQ

We arrived and were greated with the nicest hostess ever.  WAfter being escorted to our table we were given a sampler of their appetizer specialty, lobster potstickers.  They also brought a special appetizer for our daughter including quesadilla, carrots, etc... she was in heaven.  First place I have been in in a long time that didn't make her feel like she was a third wheel or offer her only boring dishes.  The food was great, the service incredible and the desert fabulous.  Their fish is cooked to perfection and their choices are varied.  I wish the prices were a little cheaper but they do offer fixed price dinners for reasonable prices.  I would spread out the tables a bit more, we were close to our neighbors and overheard their whole conversation.  

Still, a must go treasure in Summerlin.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,2,1,5,VjJWDqxgI8lFII0bl4Fmlw

Now that I live in Vegas (coincidentally only about 1.5 miles from the Roy's in Summerlin) I am still a frequent diner to Roy's- no matter what they always deliver a delectable meal! 

Best Appetizer- Ahi Poke, a traditional Hawaiian starter, it has onions and avocado mixed in, which all together it just melts in your mouth. Their edamame has chunks of sea salt on it that are like the size of a large grain of sand- I love salt, so it's one of my favorites!

The butter fish is always prepared and cooked flawlessly. The macadamia nut crusted opakapaka with lobster sauce (It was a special when I was there last) was outstanding. 

For dessert, the chocolate soufflé- be sure to order this before you start your entree, it takes a little while to make.
