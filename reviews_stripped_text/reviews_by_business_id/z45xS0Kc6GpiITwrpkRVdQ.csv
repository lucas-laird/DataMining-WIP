My wife and I were on our annual Vegas golf vacation, and we decided  we would dress up a little and have our anniversary dinner at a really nice restaurant.  Andiamo was highly recommended to us, so we made our reservations for 7 pm on a Friday night.

When we arrived, we were a few minutes early but got seated right away with no problem at all.  Again, this was 7pm on a Friday night and we had no wait whatsoever.  Most places, even with reservations, there is a little wait, but not here.  The ambience is terrific, nice and quiet, even a little romantic.   Sandy, our server, was wonderful!    She made us feel welcome, gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu without feeling rushed.  

My wife had the agnolotti and I had the swordfish, and we both agreed that our dishes were absolutely delicious.   The courses were brought to us in a nicely-timed manner, allowing us to savor our food and not feel as though we had to hurry.   We never had to ask for refills on water, as the staff was on the ball with the pitchers.   I had a glass of chardonnay that was just right, and my wife was equally happy with her merlot.  

Dessert and coffee topped off an exquisite meal.    And when the tab came, it was a pleasant surprise, because even though we were prepared to spend quite a bit for a very special 5th anniversary dinner,  the tab was well under what we were prepared to pay for such a wonderful meal.  

I highly recommend Andiamo.   In fact, it may just become our ""go to"" place for any future anniversaries we spend in Vegas.",GxC0ecnoavimcwfyK5SkOQ,0,0,5,0U-ZvQVrYYZSlQ3u3CgFrQ

Anyway, I love the downtown area and am willing to explore. This was my first time to the D Hotel. 
The hotel and casino is what you expect for the downtown area. Older but revamped. The restaurant is up the escalator near the restrooms.
Really nice decor and old Vegas feel with formal dressed waitstaff. 
Service is very attentive. 
They serve a bread basket with a olive antipasti that was nice. Bread was soft with a crunchy crust. My husband and I ordered a nice red blend wine.
We started with the table side prepared Caesar Salad that was ok but not my favorite. Liked the presentation but maybe too much dressing. 
We decided to go with steaks; I ordered  the small filet mignon, cooked rare plus. It was perfect. My husband ordered the bone in ribeye; also cooked rare plus. It was medium to well cooked. Very disappointed but didn't want to send back. Doggies got a great treat. Also, all the steaks come with a sauce. My husband did not like that. 
We shared the White Truffle Whipped Potatoes that were unbelievable. Only complaint is the small portion size. I so wanted 3 times more. We also ordered the Button Mushrooms with Onions that was also very good.
We finished with the Kit Kat dessert that was a great way to finish the dinner and wine. Crunchy bottom layer with a Chocolate Mousse and Peanut Butter Mousse layered with a Ganache coating.
Overall a really nice dinner.  I would go back for the Truffled Potatoes",dhXETGuW7zubhLrttkbUGQ,1,0,3,xbil7qKoRbMT8CvVpPMubg

145412,2013-06-20,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"I'm very late writing this review.  I ate dinner here 4 nights over March Madness for 2013 and I was in town for a total of 7 nights.  It was so good and the service so fantastic that I kept going back.

First, this is an amazing restaurant for Las Vegas, Strip or Downtown. I am very glad it is downtown at The D since I usually stay there during March Madness.  

Oysters were fantastic.  I did have one that I thought was off (and I eat oysters by the dozen weekly, usually if possible very many dozen) and no questions asked, everything replaced.  Perhaps someone might have caught it, but I don't blame anyone for this.

One great note, I ordered the Lobster Risotto from the bar on a Tuesday.  It arrived and was fabulous...but missing the truffles.  I immediately noticed and let the bartender know.  She went to the kitchen, the chef walked out, looked at the dish, apologized and took it away.  It returned with the perfect amount of truffles and added lobster.  Fantastic.  No discussion, just an apology and the dish made right, probably far better than on the list.

I think this place is amazing.  I was there at the beginning when they'd only been open for I think less than a month. But top to bottom after 4 dinners, this place is five stars with no questions asked.  Sure, I had some hiccups in a couple of items, but there is no way that it detracts from the experience because they did EVERYTHING right.

Bartender was very knowledgable about the wines and I like that.

Great place.  I'm going back as soon as I can.  I would travel across country to eat here.",URziMTGW_qU7tX6kTWTQvw,3,0,5,ccFLXf1q9i8Qjla146UcfA

Biggest martini I have ever had! Waiters in tux and had great service. Sit in a booth. The grilled portobello mushroom with char grilled beef tenderloin and zip sauce for a starter was over the top and huge ...so share. We had Italian dishes that were so homemade. If the steak in the starter is any indication of how good their aged meat is..wow! They are famous for their desserts. You would swear the the old Italian grandma was in the back making them. We had the tiramisu ....heaven. We will be back for just steak next time.",yUFP5Ajy8pd2GnS7uBUmBA,0,0,4,IkbPlu7ibgP2LVjxXPwldw
170232,2013-08-14,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"With literally over 500 places to eat in Las Vegas, this is without a doubt in the top ten.  I can say that with conviction due to the fact that I have eaten at nearly every highly rated restaurant in Vegas (from a 7 dollar a plate diner to some of the most expensive places on the Strip).   Knowing of the Andiamo name from living not too far from Detroit, my wife and I went for dinner on a Saturday evening.

Andiamo is located downtown inside The D Las Vegas.  When we were there, signage was not too visible, but it is at the top of the escalators to the second floor.  The decor is a nod to the way vegas restaurants used to be...dim lighting, quiet, private.  Some of the most popular places in Vegas, you literally have to yell to be heard by someone sitting 3 feet from you.  At Andiamo, all of the booths on the outer wall of the restaurant have walls that make it very quiet and private.  The detail in the decor stretches from the elaborate metal ceiling to the simple, yet elegant light fixtures.  It really creates a sense of calm and class in an otherwise loud and boisterous environment (Vegas)

The staff is excellent, with serving teams working in perfect harmony.  A water glass is never less than half full and service is very attentive without being stuffy and over the top.  

Well, finally to the food...I don't eat salad, however my wife does and she raved about the freshness of the vegetables as well as the in-house made fresh mozzarella.  The variety of breads served at the table were freshly baked, warm, and moist, not something sitting under a heat lamp like in some restaurants. 

 I ordered Agnolotti with Palmina sauce at the recommendation of our server.  Agnolotti are handmade ravioli stuffed with a combination of pork and beef with Italian seasoning.  It is quite possibly the best pasta dish I have ever eaten.  The way the pork and beef in the pasta meshed with the lighter Palmino sauce was incredible.   Andiamo partners with the leading supplier of hormone free meats in the country and it shows.  

After the incredible dessert tray is presented, we enjoyed a caramel cheesecake with hot caramel drizzled over the top.  It was out of this world.  Lots of classic Italian desserts are served also.

After our dessert was finished, the restaurant manager came over and asked if we had an enjoyable experience.  We made small talk for a while and shared with him how impressed we were with the entire experience from start to finish.  Prices are not inflated like they are in some Vegas restaurants.  For what you get out of the whole dining experience (service, ambiance, food, etc) it is likely the best bargain in the city.

Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is truly a gem in Downtown Vegas, and is easily its best restaurant.  Hopefully The D increases signage to draw in people looking for an outstanding meal at a very fair price.  I truly think that if Mr. Vicari desires, he can open an outpost on the strip in a major resort, and you will will see a shift in the landscape of Italian food in Vegas.",-0dgiealNJ3AeX9RmI8F5A,1,0,5,WprosXRBITW9zp5-4TCI-g

I was excited to go there because it had been named best new restaurant in Vegas for 2013.  We were starving and we came ready to throw back some cash on a fantastic meal - - we were not disappointed!  First, our waiter Miguel was phenomenal.  Professional, funny and well very knowledgeable about the menu.  

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - the infamous big giant meatball, the calamari, and some shrimp cocktail.  The meatball was amazing. Often times large meatballs are dry inside, but this one was perfect.  The shrimp cocktail were super fresh and tasty.  The calamari was excellent as well.  We then ordered the Caesar salad.  The dressing and salad is prepared by the waiter fresh for you at the table and it is freakin' amazing.  Best Caesar salad I have ever had.   

On to the entrees.  My husband and I each got a large Ribeye on the bone.  Mine, however, was a ""special"" that night and it had a flavorful mushroom sauce and awesome gnocchi.  I was concerned that the sauce would be too salty or overpowering, but it wasn't, it was perfect.  The steak melted in your mouth.  Hands down, everyone at the table tried my steak and said it was the best they had ever eaten.  (And we've eaten at many of the best steakhouses in NYC and Boston).  I also tried the lobster risotto and the filet mignon, which were ordered by my friends (all tasty).  Finally, for dessert, we had a slice of coconut cake  - - it was plenty large enough for the four of us to share after eating a huge meal.  

We will definitely be going back to Andiamo next time we are in Vegas!  Amazing meal.  Best. Steak. Ever.  You should eat here - Ask for Miguel.",9oNEd8JjMaDnmtmpwPpMRA,2,1,5,aZ6eCuILhcJKzw4abSrjlw

We had the table side Caesar which was awesome.  We all got various pasta dishes which ranged from average to delicious(I'm sorry I don't remember exactly which we got!). We shared two bottles of red wine, five entrees, two salads and received a free dessert in honor of our celebration which was a lovely touch(I had told them in advance we were celebrating).

Service: Beautiful ambiance and great server. Hugo apologized when there was 15 minute wait between the appetizer and entree. 

Appetizer: Lobster bisque is fresh and amazing. Husband really enjoyed it.

Entree: I ordered the Frutti de Mare, which has lots of fresh seafood with unique squid-ink spaghetti. Large portion. Hubby ordered the 16oz. bone-in ribeye steak medium rare. To our disappointment, the steak is beyond chewy...He thought maybe his first bite was overcooked, sliced from another part of the steak, which also is really chewy. He fed me a piece because I didn't believe how the best steakhouse in Vegas can mess up the signature dish!! I couldn't sink my teeth in the meat and had to really fight to chew it...

Sides: Truffled whipped potato is beautifully flavored.  Grilled asparagus drizzled with balsamic reduction is top-notch.

Summary: Hubby returned the steak after 3 bites, totally disappointed and wonder where this 4.5 stars yelp rating came from. He did not want them to substitute it with anything else, because he used to work in the restaurant and was afraid of repercussion by the kitchen staff. Just think about what unhappy kitchen staff can do to your food....

The cheese plate was not the same that my friends remembered (smaller), the Bronzino was a bit dry and overly lemon-y, and my husband ordered the steak special - which was really just strange. It was described as a steak with a side of pasta.. but it was really more like ""steak Parmesan"" on top of pasta, served in a heated dish. My husband probably would not have ordered it if he had known it would come covered in cheese, and the hot plate actually cooked his steak beyond his requested medium rare.

Old vegas is more cramped but quite exciting.  The restaurant is not what you expect when you walk into the D Casino, its a pleasant surprise.
  
The atmosphere of Andiamo is cozy and inviting, we were seated in a circular booth which was huge for the two of us.  The servers were very attentive but not overly checking up on us.  

We shared an appetizer of the fried mozzarella balls (not sure it was called this on the menu) and i enjoyed the sauce it was sitting in.  i'm not really a fan of fried moz but the tomato sauce had olives in it and i loved the flavor.  the husband did not like the olives and ate all the mozz.  it was a nice tradeoff.  For the entree the husband had filet mignon and i had the branzino.  If you are a fish lover go for the branzino!  so tender with a mild lemon and sage flavor and the saute chickpea and peppers beneath the fish was delicious!

615352,2013-08-29,1,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"An Italian Steakhouse so AMAZING even John Gotti would have approved!

Andiamo, located inside The D casino in downtown LV is one of only a few hidden gems left in a city that was better ran by the mob!  It is difficult to pull me away from my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, but since I found myself in Sin City twice within 3 weeks I decided to expand my horizons and try Andiamo with NO disappointment! 

THE DECOR:
A tastefully designed upscale steakhouse with some of the most private feeling and luxurious booths one will ever encounter in a restaurant!  A GREAT eye for design.

THE SERVICE:
While the service in Las Vegas has slowly sunk into the sand, the service at this restaurant was simply OUTSTANDING!  Ask for Darren, he will take excellent care of you as he did us.  He will ensure you not only have a great meal, but also a memorable dining experience.

THE FOOD: (See attached photographs)
For starters, Andiamo has without a doubt the BEST meatball on the planet!  A meatball so juicy, flavorful, and tender it will simply melt in your mouth!  Although the size of a softball, I would order 2 as they go quick no matter how hungry your party is ""Utah!.........get me 2!!""

Next, the Sausage & Peppers are to DIE for!  Again, one of the best I have ever had.  So good I still wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats dreaming of them!  The Chef didn't miss a single ingredient in this dish and is nothing less than SPECTACULAR!  

For the main courses we ordered 2 chops.  Andiamo serves dry aged meats that are out of this world; Aged to PERFECTION!  My compliments to the Chef.

We ordered the impressive Tomahawk Steak, which is actually a bone-in rib eye (so called because of its resemblance to a tomahawk) and it comes to the table still SIZZLING in the skillet.  A SUPERB steak that needs no special sauces or added herbs.  I highly recommend it.

We also ordered the Porterhouse chop (Both the NY and Filet cuts) this too was an amazing steak with plenty of flavor and the most tender Porterhouse I have ever sank a steak knife into.  

THE DESSERT:
For dessert we ordered 3 things (Might as well go down in flames)
First was the Coconut cake that was unparalleled to just about any dessert known to man (Or woman) I am an avid fan of GOOD coconut desserts (I can drink sun tan lotion straight out of the bottle)  This is simply HEAVEN!

Next we ordered the Kit Kat dessert which has spoiled me for life as I can never eat that plastic wrapped candy bar again.  Say no more.

The last dessert was a chocolate cake of sorts, as I am not a huge fan of chocolate cake, this certainly filled the void.  It is a chocolate dream for those that can appreciate it!  

THE COFFEE:
What TRUE Italian restaurant would be complete without Lavazza Coffee.  Simply the BEST coffee in North America!  A PERFECT way to compliment your meal and dinning experience!

THE BOTTOM LINE:
If you are looking for a TOP steakhouse and incredible Italian food, Andiamo is the BEST of both worlds!  An upscale Italian steakhouse that is sure to please even the toughest steak connoisseur like myself.  I always judge a good steakhouse by how many mobsters got whacked outside (i.e. ""Sparks"" - Paul Castellano).  While it is true that Las Vegas was better ran by the mob, if the mob still owned this city today, there would certainly be some Tommy guns outside Andiamo waiting for today's Godfather to finish his last meal.

Service was attentive, bordering on compulsive.  Bread was okay, vastly improved by the tapenade they serve with it.  I went with the bone-in ribeye, which was cooked to my medium-rare order, and it looked quite appetizing on the plate.  And...nothing.  I was hoping for the feeling I have gotten at so many other steakhouses where the beef just melts in your mouth, contentment fills your body and a lazy smile spreads across your face.  It just wasn't there.  The pressure shifted to the italian sausage and meatball sides that I had ordered, hoping they put the Italian in Italian Steakhouse.  Mediocrity prevailed there as well.  Same with the ""free"" pasta side.

Our wedding party which included several guests arriving from several different states needed a place that could comfortably seat 15 people with great food and a fantastically cooked steak for the groom....that was no small feat. It also had to be well priced and include ""ambiance"" for a 7pm wedding dinner.  After researching several different places including online reviews, pictures of food and interior decor we decided on Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse. I started corresponding with the Manager and a very nice Associate in his office who was more than happy to work with us on a preset menu. The three course meal we decided on had several different options each person chose from including four entrees. The desert cart was well stocked with beautiful looking cakes and pies that were pleasing to the eye and delectable to the palate. The food was Phenomenal!  Let me say that again PHENOMENAL!!!!

I am not big on mixed drinks but found them flavorful especially the Old Fashion.  We (bride and groom) loved their Old Fashion cocktails.  You have not had an Old Fashion until you have tried one of theirs, its sets the bar, HIGH!
 
Our host, Miguel, was ""right on point"" and fully understood the term ""customer service.""  The groom especially approved.   We THANK YOU Ken, Milli, Miguel and all others who supported you in making our wedding dinner a wonderful success for the Klaniecki Wedding Party on April 13, 2017.  It was greatly appreciated.

We started by sharing the meatball. After the word of mouth, I expected a big ball of heaven.  What I got an average, dry ball of meat.  Perhaps this is what derailed my dinning experience. To be blunt... It was horrible.  The texture more chewy than delicate.  The sauce unforgettable.   

The pasta served pre-entree tasted like it came from a can.  Really close to Chef Boyrdee.  It was cold, thick and non-edible.

My main course, the filet was over cooked and lacked flavor.  I ordered it medium rare only to get something on the upper side of medium well.  The side dish, the Tuscan Potatoes was easily the all-star of the evening.  Seasoned perfectly.... I could have ate the skillet by myself.  I love potatoes!!!

My dinning partners ordered the Prime Rib special and absolutely loved it.  They started with the Mozzarella Napoletana and shortly there after were served with a 3 inch thick slap of meat that was perfectly medium rare.  I was offered a piece which I gladly accepted and concurred, this was a great piece of beef.

Did this restaurant fail completely? No, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype.  I could have easily enjoyed Outback on The Strip and spent a quarter of the price.",bxBiYX_2GObgek3sGnPhSA,0,0,3,4ECAc96ROI4iG28lnSr-Kw

The Caesar salad required two people to order it because the waiter actually has to make the whole salad and dressing at the table. I wasn't in the mood for a salad but my husband really wanted a Caesar salad, but opted for the wedge because of the two person minimum. Danny went above and beyond and still made the salad for my husband and even offered to split it to share some with me. That shows me amazing customer service.

The food was perfect, great flavor and perfectly cooked. The service second was to none, the server explained and made a great recommendation with a wine paired perfectly for our meal. Our go to restaurant used to be Emeril's Fish house at the MGM, but now with having to pay for parking at the MGM and Andiamo's being in the hotel we stay at along with the food and service being phenomenal well Andiamo's won out as our new go to restaurant. We have been here several times now to eat, service and food has not changed still top notch.

1144505,2013-08-11,1,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"There were many fine Yelp reviews for Andiamo, yet they STILL managed to exceeded my high expectations.
The Food:
Steaks are great here.  I don't eat meat, but I still appreciate the effort they go to serve a wonderful cut.  Wet and dry aging for 6 weeks, cut at the restaurant (not before delivery), and other quality controls, were savored by our guests.  Our waiter explained that ""Medium"" was seared outside, with a band of pink, not raw, in the middle.  The Fillet was exactly as described.  Delicious.
Seafood:  Daily flown in from around the world.  None is more than one day old.  They have an impressive variety of choices.  (This is a STEAKHOUSE!?)
The Cioppino was filled with squid, octopus, mussels, clams, tuna, and 1/2 a lobster tail.  The broth was a reduction sauce that was almost painfully rich in flavor.
Our table also enjoyed the scallops and the Chilean Sea Bass.  The latter was on a bed of tiny mushrooms with long stems and small heads.  We asked the waiter what type of mushroom is this?  ""Wild mushrooms.""  Where are they from?  ""Farmed here in Las Vegas.""  If they are farmed, they can't be wild.  ""Everything in Las Vegas is wild.""
We were served a complementary small plate of pasta with a cheese blended tomato sauce; fabulous!  No doubt, Andiamo does a great pasta.
And the tapenade with grilled Baguette slices was chunky goodness.
Cocktails are generous, coffee was rich, as were the deserts.
The Ambiance:
Valet was available, and prompt.  The D's casino is populated with many T-shirt wearing customers; just ignore them.  We sat in a private feeling, circular high backed sofa, with a domed fabric canopy.  Very intimate.
The Service:
This is where Andiamo shines!  Miguel, our waiter, was ""old school.""  He was knowledgeable about the entire menu, attentive to our needs, followed up with us throughout the meal at just the right times, and he accommodated our special requests perfectly.  As other Yelpers noted, service is exemplary!
We even had the opportunity to meet the corporate executive chef; Jim, from Detroit.  He was working on the night of his 6th wedding anniversary, while his wife was credit carding.  Anyway, Jim told the history of the company.  They have 23 restaurants in Detroit, with Andiamo being their first in Vegas.  The restaurant owner, Joe Vicari, and the D's owners go way back.  Dining at Andiamo, you can feel how important it is for the restaurant to be spectacular, to help make the D a success.  But I also can tell they want to wow us customers.  The service at Andiamo is like at Commander's Palace in New Orleans, just without the white gloves.
Special events:
Jim gave us a preview of an upcoming 7 course meal/wine pairing; date to be announced.  I mentioned that my wife and I do not eat meat or poultry, just vegetarian or fish.  Jim said no problem, give him a call and he will make sure we have a great experience.  Some restaurants are willing to modify their menu a course or two, some refuse entirely.  When I dine, it comes out of my entertainment budget; so great service is really appreciated, but rarely done, let alone done this well.
Value:  Steaks and seafood entrees run aprox. $40.  (Check out the menu online.)  Lobster bisque (super rich!) was $8, as were most appetizers/salads.  All the salads were better than other high class restaurants, and Miguel made the BEST table side Caesar salad ever!  We had cocktails, coffee, split a desert, for less than $300 for four persons.  The pasta dishes are less than $30, and I am sure very delicious.

This Italian steakhouse is located on the second level of the D Hotel & Casino. Just go up the escalators and hang a right. Walk down the dim hallway and enjoy a warm greeting from the friendly and professional hostess. 

I was dining alone this evening, and heard the restaurant has a bar that also serves dinner there (Hugo's and Binions downtown will not serve food at their bars. It's solo-diner discrimination, I tell ya. Loners unite!). 

It was about 9:30 pm on a Sunday evening and, having just flown in from Denver, I was quite hungry. Most of the restaurant was empty at this point. The bar, which consists of six seats, was completely empty. So I had my choice of seats. Yeah!

An extremely kind and professional server named Shannon welcomed me and handed over a menu. She was a nice ""upscale"" kind of server who still maintained a down-to-earth demeanor. 

Oh speaking of the meal. It was outstanding! I ordered the filet mignon (medium) and a side of roasted potatoes. All were great. But be forewarned: the roasted potatoes are enough to feed a family. Maybe even an army. But they're very good and well-seasoned, so don't hesitate. 

Shannon also brought over a basket of bread with a side of spread. This spread contained olives and eggplant - two of my favorite foods. So yeah, I liked that too. And it's complimentary, so what's not to like? 

The atmosphere here is very decorative with a modern flair. It's dim, but not too dim. And the bar area is a more peaceful place at which to dine than, say Vic & Anthony's. This is due to its design. It's only open at one end, whereas Vic & Anthony's is open at both. As I sat there, I noticed that having only one open end cuts down on both noise and traffic, making for a more tranquil dining experience. Less clinking of utensils and dishware. 

So my hats off to Andiamo's. It's slid into first place as my overall favorite downtown restaurant, and it beats the other steakhouses, too. That was a high bar to reach. Congrats to the D! This will become a big draw I'm sure. 

Update 2014: Shannon no longer works there so you'll have to hunt for an equal professional. May check it out again on my next trip.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,5,1,4,_SwX6MVVk9VbwxNMqY4zIA

Reminded me a lot of Hugo's Cellar, but with a more modern flair and a more lively atmosphere. 

The service is top-notch here.  All the waiters are cultured and know the menu front-to-back.  Our waiter gave us some excellent suggestions, particularly in the wine. 

We started with a bottle of Chianti Classico, Querciabella, 2013.  Smooth and delicious.  

They bring out a sauce made from Eggplant, tomatoes and olive oil which was quite good  

For dinner, we shared the bone-in 20 oz Ribeye with Lobster mashed potatoes.

I generally am not a big fan of downtown or its currently available cuisine. After seeing the Wizard of Oz at the Smith Center we decided to grab a bite downtown. I raised an eyebrow but went with it, and I'm so glad I did!

The feel is very traditional, old school steakhouse. We enjoyed:

-Riesling
-Champagne
-Oysters
-Lobster Bisque
-Caesar Salad
-Hand made pasta (I added mushrooms and red pepper flakes, so delicious)
-Ribeye

Everything was delicious. My favorite dishes were the oysters and the pasta. I am very particular about noodle texture and Andiamo's texture was spot on.

Seated with no wait on a busy Friday night.  Started with the Salami & Cheese appetizer which was absolutely amazing.  Unique taste with plenty of variety.  Our entrees included Veal Osso Bucco, The Veal Chop special, Lobster Risotto,  and Tortellaci Giuseppe.  I can't say enough about the portion size; well worth the price.  The veal entrees were huge.  The Lobster Risotto and Veal were the best we ever had.  Spectacular service by Hugo our waiter.  There were some families with children but I'd leave the kids home.

Before we were even halfway through our meal, we were talking about what we planned to order next time- that's how good of a first impression they made!

We started with a gratis cold app of roasted eggplant and olives in San Marzano tomatoes with the bread basket while we reviewed the wine list. They have a surprisingly small selection of Italian reds but Levi guided us towards the Palazzo Della Torre Meritage and it did not disappoint. We ordered the giant meatball app recommended by so many other reviews, and it was great- robust sauce, ample fresh ricotta, and a flavorful blend of meats. The nightly special app of a grilled porchetta with peppadew vinaigrette, also recommended by Levi, was pretty spectacular too!

We shared the house Caesar, a huge portion with a great dressing but no anchovies, followed by the 24oz porterhouse and a side of the truffle mashed potatoes. The steak was huge, great char, paired well with but did not need the house zip sauce. It was exceptionally tender and immediately absolved me of the guilt of not ordering a pasta dish at an Italian restaurant. The potatoes were a shareable portion with a pronounced truffle flavor and a smooth texture- if you are a meat and potatoes kind of person, this meal will make you quite happy!

Our server brought us a complimentary Grand Marnier creme brulee for our special evening, which was totally unnecessary but much appreciated. Service throughout was attentive and warm. Looking forward to another visit to try the pastas or the 32oz Tomahawk!

TIP: Sit at the bar to avoid a wait, it also has the best lighting. You won't be able to get your Caesar prepared tableside but they will waive the 2-person minimum.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,30,19,4,CmHvm8EjjuIUjzA__7L52A

1661190,2017-08-01,3,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"Having been a frequent guest at The D since they opened, I've always wanted to eat at Andiamo, I listen to a few Vegas podcasts and this steakhouse always gets great reviews. But this place is not cheap, a real destination dining sort of thing, and for many years we went to the strip and ate at places like Gordon Ramsey's Steak, Bobby Flay's place, or Giada, because the prices are about the same as dinner at Andiamo, even though we always stay at The D. This past Memorial Day weekend, my wife and I were playing a few slots really late ""before we turn in"", and she won a $1400 bonus. The problem was this was like 3:30 am and because such a win requires lots of authentication and tax documents, it was 4:15 before we could go up to our room. That was when I made her promise that she would take us out to dinner finally at Andiamo with her winnings the next night. Well, the next night was Memorial Day, it was tricky to get reservations, but $20 tip got us in at 7:30. The restaurant was packed, with white jacketed waiters and wine slingers running all about the small space. Our waiter greeted us, gave us a little spiel, took drink orders, and then brought out the bread and chutney that each table gets. In the time we were waiting for him to return to take our entree orders we were watching the table adjacent to us place their orders with their white-jacketed waiter.
    Before I knew what was going on, my wife grabbed my arm and started saying ""Oh My God, Oh My God"", pointing out the back of the waiter not 7 feet from our table. Unbeknownst to him, a large 2 inch cockroach was climbing from his right hip, across his jacket, to his head, then on to the top of the banquette where the party of six was ordering. We saw the poor diners notice this at this point, the waiter became shockingly aware, and the party was immediately re-seated never to be seen by us again. Shortly thereafter someone I assumed was a wait captain came up and asked my wife what was going on. She told him what we had just witnessed, and he apologized. No other tables near or around us, miraculously, noticed what had happened. 
    When our bill came, we were charged full price for everything, there was no apology from the waiter upon presenting the bill, nothing. Listen, no one expects a free meal at a very expensive steakhouse just because you see a 2 inch cockroach crawl all over the waitstaff and then onto the seating area of your neighboring diners, but to not give us some sort of discount, or sending out a dessert or something, I thought was in poor form. 
     Steaks, delicious by the way, really good. But tainted of course by the insect invasion and total ignoring of our shocking dining experience by Andiamo staff. If they would have even comped our two vodka drinks, I might never had even taken the last hour to post this. Plus, it's been months since Memorial Day, but as busy as I have been I didn't wanna let this one get by without a review.",M1_VCapGLtH6S5BxVjKZ1Q,3,0,2,7Zn7CcNZiKDk9-Obb5jQgQ

The food...
Everything was great but I wasn't blown away by the colossal shrimp cocktail which wasn't so colossal, the white truffle whipped potatoes as I've had way better and the tiramisu which needed more coffee liquor.

My friend, my wife and myself dined there on a recent Friday night.  We shared a bottle of wine and each had a steak - two medium filet mignons and one bone-in ribeye, which my wife said was overly fatty.  For sides we had a plate of spinach (more on this in a minute), a very average baked potato, and some roasted potatoes  I also had a small dinner salad.
My friend had a small desert pastry and a cup of coffee at the end..

Total Tab = $300!!!  Oh my!  Where did these 4-5 star ratings come from???

When ordering, the stuffed shirt of a waiter convinced us to get a bottle of wine instead of the three of us ordering glasses of the same type.  His argument was that you get an extra glass and its a much better deal.  The bottle of wine was $76 - my bad for not asking the price but it turned out to be no cheaper per/glass than by ordering by the glass.  The waiter deceptively upsold that bottle of wine to us.  When ordering the sides,I told him that I wanted a little spinach too and he assured me that three teaspoon-sized portion (no exaggeration) that my friend had ordered would serve us all, easily.  Not even close.  In retrospect, at the prices they were charging I should be thankful that we did not order more spinach!  That plate of spinach would not even feed a bloated rabbit after a three-course meal - It was a joke and I believe they were getting $9.00 for that.  Regret that I did not take a picture of the portion.

I've had steak dinners at Outback Steakhouse that were at least as good and for a LOT LESS MONEY than this place.   It is way overly-pretentious (and also a total disconnect from the dumpy hotel that it is in), mostly average and extremely overpriced.

We were a party of four and were seated at a four top near the bar. The booths looked far more comfortable, fyi. The bread we were served was good but I found the eggplant carponata it came with was way too sweet. Both couples ordered the Ciao Portabello appetizer to share. The ""signature Zip sauce"" was too buttery and not very good. Not sure why it is called Zip Sauce, quite frankly. After we finished them we realized there was no fontina cheese on either of our plates. Our bad we didn't catch this sooner but we decided to let management know. We spoke with Lisa, the manager, who smiled and thanked us for ""letting her know."" We all thought it was an odd response but we let it go. As I mentioned earlier, the bronzino was actually quite good as our main course. We had a look at the dessert menu but decided to pass. We were presented with the check and saw both orders of Ciao Portabello apps were on the check. We spoke with Lisa the manager a second time and suggested it was not appropriate that we were charged when neither of the apps had cheese on them. I suggested she should have taken one of them off at the very least. Lisa smiled again and said she didn't realize the waiter was presenting us with the check and she had wanted to credit us for one of the Ciao Portabello appetizer.

Long story short, there are many, many other better choices for dinner in Las Vegas than Andiamo. The food is mediocre at best and I don't think management handled our complaint in a professional manner. At the very least Lisa could have offered us an additional order of Ciao Portabello and included the fontina cheese on it.

I had such a wonderful time eating at Joe Vicari's.  The restaurant instantly makes you feel at home and relaxed, far away from any craziness downstairs in the casino.

We ordered one of the best tasting Meat Balls I have ever had.  The meat ball was huge, juicy and delicious.  The two of us had a hard time finishing it due to the size - we were also worried that we had two large steaks coming, so we had to stop.

We ordered a bottle of Caymus from their very nice wine list.  -The prices were better than any restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas.  The waiter professionally opened the bottle for us, and left us to enjoy the ambiance.  

Once our main course arrived, we knew we made the right decision to stop before we finished the meat ball.  My Rib Eye Steak was enough for two people and was cooked flawlessly!  We also had a beautifully cooked New York Steak to share with a side of Truffled Mashed Potatoes to put the meal over the top.

I highly recommend this restaurant and will be eating here next time I visit Las Vegas!",o_8sVoYIFnoVun5YY_lAEg,10,7,5,fqBuyhe_CEEezSqEvlAGlQ

2000037,2016-05-26,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"Our first visit to The D Hotel in the old part of Las Vegas and Freemont Street.  We had tickets for the show ""Defending The Caveman"" and decided to have dinner at Andiamo.  What a great hidden find and treasure! The entrance is tucked away and had we not already done an internet search for restaurants in or near the D, we would not have found Andiamo.  Bill was our waiter and was terrific, please ask for him to be your server.

We started with two Grey Goose martinis (perfectly made and chilled with extra olives).  A wonderful basket of breads and hand crafted bread sticks appeared as well as a scrumptious amuse de bouche of eggplant caponata.  We ordered the special, a large bone-in rib steak (caveman sized to go with the show!) and it was big enough to share.  It came with a wonderful side of potato gnocchi with peas and an Alfredo style sauce.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec wine...delicious!  No room for dessert although the desserts on display were very tempting.  In true Las Vegas style, we made it disappear!

Near by tables ordered the Caesar Salad prepared at tableside.  Both the creation and service was worthy.  The salad looked beautiful and sparked other tables to order the same.  Another couple ordered the Lobster Bisque which had an enticing aroma.  Judging by the gentleman's expression as he took his first sip, the flavor must have been devine.  

A great dining room, beautiful, cozy and handsomely decorated.  Old Vegas class, style and quality.  One of the best meals we have ever had anywhere!  Give it a try!",l-BEmd-EoQbotGllqnPSYQ,0,0,5,RQN1tDsV1ne2ikYVsfvqqg

The service was OK. You'll see a theme here, as much of the experience was OK. 

The bread was good. I liked the breadsticks. 

We ordered the house salad, kale salad, and shrimp cocktail. The house salad was a lot of lettuce with a dash of oil and some garbanzo beans. Bland and boring. The kale salad was good and flavorful. The shrimp were OK. The type of shrimp you'd expect at a lesser place. At $5/ shrimp, I want the large, white, flavorful shrimp. They missed here. 

Three of us ordered filets, with one of us adding the lobster tail, and one of us ordered the salmon. The steaks were very good. Cooked properly and tasty. The sauce that came on them is there signature sauce, and it was as delicious as the waiter told us it would be. The lobster tail was very good too. The baked potatoes were of poor quality, but the roasted potatoes and onions were tasty. 

Desserts were OK. 

In a nutshell, this experience was OK. Our bill with a modest bottle of wine was $400 plus tip. We're happy to spend top dollar for a great meal. $100/ person for an OK meal is a bit disappointing.

2045492,2013-10-09,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"My husband and I are ""locals"" (we've lived here about a year now), and we joined 10 other people who were visiting, for a special dinner at Andiamo. We had wanted to try an upscale steakhouse, and were pleased that the group decided on this one, as we've heard good things about it. 
First of all, the venue is wonderful, kind of retro 'speakeasy' type elegance. And its not too loud to enjoy the company you are with. 
Considering how big our party was, I have to say that the service was marvelous. Every order came out in timely fashion (nobody was left waiting while others ate), and every order was correct. Mergim (I hope I got his name right!), our Albanian-American waiter, had two assistants to help him serve us all. Other than being a bit slow to refill water glasses, the whole service was perfect. It was a wonderful, leisurely, conversation-filled dining experience.
Being such a large group, we tried most of the menu items. The assorted meats & cheeses and the sausage & peppers were standout appetizers, as was the assortment of breads. The lobster bisque was ""to die for"", and the Caesar salad was authentic.  I didn't think the little dish of pasta (vodka-tomato sauce over angel hair) that came out between appetizers and main courses was anything special; but the others liked it. The king crab legs were opened by a waiter, so the person who ordered those didn't have to struggle with them.  The steaks came out with a wonderful surface char, and everybody said theirs was done exactly as ordered. Don't forget to order their ""zip"" sauce to dip your meat into! Strange name, but a rich, buttery stock that complements red meat perfectly. Skip banal sides like shoestring potatoes, and go for standouts such as the huge moist meatballs, or the lobster mac-and-cheese (it had huge chunks of lobster meat!). 
We even got a free dessert for the birthday guy (kit kat tiramisu--we all got a bite)! When we split the bill, it came to about $90 a person, including alcoholic drinks. I believe that is pretty reasonable for one of these class of steakhouses, considering all the dishes we ordered. The food, the service, and the ambience could not be beat. 
My only regret was that nobody else in our party wanted to linger for more desserts, because I've heard great things about those too. Oh well...my husband and I will be back for our next ""special"" occasion dinner!",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,1,1,5,I32iJp2vFE9sIDZJqpVVTg

Although it is located at a famous tourist site inside a casino; the chances wearing a formal outfit is very low. My family had two men wearing tank tops and that isn't dress code therefore the restaurant provided them with two polo collar tops. 
    We had two servers for the night sadly I did not catch their names but they were extremely nice and one of which was funny. They seated us and had much patience with two members of our party who were fairly drunk. 
    For starters we were given a dip that was made with different types of oils/dressing and veggies aside with sourdough cheese bread and bread sticks. For appetizers we ordered the calamari, oysters, and meatballs. I am not a fan of oysters but according to my family they say it was really good. The meatballs was the recommended appetizer and I had no complaints about it whatsoever. It broke apart fairly easily but not to the point where it got frustrating. It's a pleasing feature only because that's how you know it's made by hand and it's fresh, it wasn't pre made or anything like that. The calamari didn't have much uniqueness to it but I liked its originality. The breading was perfect and it was not salty at all like some calamari's. 
     As entrees, my two brothers and aunt got pastas. Unsure of what my cousin and mother got, but my dad ordered the ribeye in medium rare and he devoured it! My uncle, the birthday girl, and I for the porterhouse steak; two in medium rare and one on medium. These steaks were cooked to perfection and was so tender it melted in my mouth. My other uncle got the baby tomahawk steak that came with potato gnocchi. The entire table also ordered three sides of mashed potatoes which was also amazing, it wasn't too salty or too mushy, just right. The porterhouse steak comes with a soup and or salad, and my cousin and uncle got the Long Island soup that comes with minced garlic in the bowl and the broth separately where the waiter pours out for you.

You enter through an exposed brick tunnel into a well appointed dining room,  with large booths along the edge of the dining area. If you make a reservation I would recommend of of the booths as they lend to a more private and intimate dinner. 

The wine list is sizable,  but no real standouts. The food is great. They do a table side caesar salad,  delicious,  but if you're a vampire skip this one. I had the lobster risotto it was awesome.

It is tucked away in The D Hotel and Casino, but once you find your way into the steakhouse, it has a beautiful decor with a midwestern chophouse feel.  

We ordered the carpaccio and it was a delicious start to the meal.  We ordered a NY Strip, Gnocci, and their signature Tomahawk 32 ounce steak.  Everything was cooked to perfection and was packed with delicious flavors and sauces for dipping the steaks.

I am a grappa connoisseur and the bar did not stock the traditional italian after dinner drink, but after speaking with the manager he informed me that there would be at least one bottle in stock next week.  They have a top notch staff and I will be returning with any friends or family that visits Las Vegas.

Martinis- tasty and cold 

Shrimp app- delicious especially with the fire sauce.

Capresse- delicious mozzarella, ok non flavorful tomatoes

Large filet mignon medium-rare (split)- great taste that was obscured by almost overwhelming salt. The split was actually a horizontal slice of the meat so we each got a 3/4 inch thick piece of steak. 
Shoestring fries- well cooked, Just the right amount of crunch. But way too salty.

Sauteed spinach- perfectly cooked, not swimming in cream. But way too salty.

Dessert- our taste buds were so over-salted, we couldn't do it, and asked for the check.

Let's start with the service. This is a place where the waiters all wear white jackets and treat you like a friend they really want to impress. Our waiter Miguel was so nice, so helpful, and so funny that I think he has been spying on us for years to perfectly tailor our experience. By far the best waiter I have ever had.

The fresh, warm bread is very good, but the spread they give you to put on it is truly outstanding. We did the tableside Caesar salad for an appetizer, which is like dinner and a show. The end result was the best Caesar I've ever had. Now I understand why this salad became so popular.

We all ordered our mains, but before they came out Miguel brought us all a little pasta course. It was in a tomato cream sauce and was just so unexpected and superb. Andiamo is full of little touches like that and I think it's what makes the place stand out so much.

I had the veal osso busco which was very good. You could tell the pasta was made fresh in house and the meat was literally falling off the bone. I thought the tomato sauce was a little bland, but everything else more than made up for it. My companions all enjoyed their steaks.

Much to my dismay, we had to run to a show so there was no time for dessert. But the next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be coming back.",SAxkrR41VowRhcb4UyE4ag,3,1,5,1yvqArC9oqdk7vsAaSaWDg

From the JUMP your experience awaits you as you transcend through a bricked tunnel threshold that reminds you of your great great grandfather's plantation cellar.

Got us an intimate crescent mood lit corner booth and PHENOMENAL creme brûlée for dessert with an Italian sweet nothing painted in chocolate that we had no idea what it said but it's the thought that counts. Let me start you off with the table side Caesar salad. Our man Jonny is the mythological god of Caesar salad. Julius Caesar himself licked each romaine heart and the dressing was the blood that Brutus drew. It was that good. And what did we get at an Italian steakhouse? Well we got steak. Not just any steak. This bone in ribeye was the best ribeye I had had in my whole life and I love meat. And the Filet my lovely ""wife"" ordered...cooked to perfection. It was medium and it was rare. It wasn't medium and it wasn't rare. It was medium rare. If you eat medium rare steak you know what a feat that is to achieve. Well chef back there at Andiamo's Italian steakhouse?

The restaurant itself have a very nice atmosphere. We were sat in a tall, private, circular booth that would be ideal for a romantic date night. Our server was very attentive and helped assist in pairing a nice glass of red wine to our steak. 

For our appetizer, we had the beet salad (very sweet with yellow and red beets accompanied with a mayo drizzle) and the lobster risotto (not a fan- was bland and missing wine!).
Our steak was cooked perfectly to order and seasoned nicely.
Our server wheeled out the a tall tier of dessert after our main course and we were able to pick and choose instead of looking at a menu. 
Dessert was a light, flavorful, and decadent coconut cake with coconut shreds, whipped cream and whatever else I can't remember... It was heavenly and my favorite part of dinner.

Our waiter thanked my husband for his military service and talked with us a little bit about his cousin who is in the service. Very nice person!!!

Now the food... We got the gigantic meatball as an appetizer and it was so perfectly perfect. The flavor was so damn good and the meatball was juicy with perfect seasoning and texture. LOVE. For entrees we got a seafood pasta and steak. The pasta was amazing and creamy and the tomahawk ribeye steak was....listen. I consider myself a steak connoisseur. This steak was the best steak I've ever had in my life. I am not lying to you. It was cooked exactly how I wanted it (medium rare) and had the perfect amount of delicious salty char crust. I told my husband that I didn't want to keep eating the steak because that meant that I would eventually finish it and it would be gone...lol! I seriously dream about this steak.

Because we had a large group, they wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived.  Do you have any friends that just can't get there on time.  So, we were penalized for the lazy stragglers.

Listen up party people a rule of thumb to be safe should be to look at the hotel the restaurant is located in, in a place like Vegas. There are of course exceptions to all rules . This place isn't one of them.

My friend suggested the place and he's a local so I said OK. The staff service etc. was good but it boils down to what your knife and fork are cutting. Appetizers mediocre, famous meatball mediocre, calamari mediocre . That was at least better than the steaks that were mediocre minus at best. My steaks temp was wrong twice and had no flavor, famous side of gnocchi mediocre all entrees mediocre. Can't get that word out of my head from that meal.

How does a place like this get all those stars? I have a few thoughts . 1. again the reviewers just don't know food . To be honest it's probably true their thoughts are shaped by other reviewers or the media or they want to be part of social media and honestly anyone qualified or unqualified can post . 

2. Many people who eat Applebee's come to Vegas and this is an upgrade for them ,I think, and they don't have a real point of reference, think Peter Lugers.  The other bizarre part is the price is Luger like , maybe same definitely not more but it's an extra tragedy at what they are charging.
3. I can't blame it on food talking heads fooling people to believe just because it's on a show since I've never seen this place on any show. Give them time they are running out of junky places .

To a hungry person, every bitter food is sweet. When the preferable is not available, the available becomes preferable!

Located in the new hip The D Casino just toward the end of Fremont blvd.  parking is $3 bucks per hour after 4 hours validation at the D club.  The parking structure is very tight and you're limited to only certain floors.  I've realized after walking the Fremont Blvd. that there are free parking lots around other casinos.  

The restaurant is located upstairs.  The entrance reminds me of a small tunneling cave.  We were there an hour before their closing time and it was super packed.  I figured  everybody was seeking a good piece of steak as well.  We waited roughly twenty minutes.  So I do recommend making reservation beforehand.  

Moving on to the food.  

For starters we ordered two colossal shrimp cocktail @ $5 each.  Compared to places like Maestros, it was a steal.  The shrimp was big, hence the name COLOSSAL, juicy and fresh.  Very refreshing and nicely presented.  I would not pass on this!!!  We also order a wedge salad but came out as chopped salad.  Omg it was so delicious.  My partner commented that it was the best she ever had.  I personally had better. 

I ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare with their special house sauce on the side.  Good beef requires no sauce is my personal take.  The steak looked so beautiful.  It had the almost perfect colorations.  It smelled delicious as well with the seasonings just glistering at me.  First cut as I see the pinkness I knew and announced to my dinner date that this is gonna be Good!!  The chef also treated me to a homemade vodka sauce side pasta.  It was yummy and, naturally, I consumed it all.  

My lovely and apparently hungry date ordered the Agnolotti and side sausage.  The Agnolotti was stuffed pasta with veal with this super rich butter sauce.  I was afraid for my heart to try it.  She was only able to eat half since it was so rich and just okay tasting.  Now the side sausage she got was actually pretty impressive.  It came with two big juicy sausages drenched in this savory robust marinara sauce.  I remember taking a bite of the sausage and wanting to lick the bowl clean because the sauce was so good.

We finished our meal with a cup of cappuccino that was foamy and good but a tad overpriced.

The service was just okay for a 3 dollar sign establishment.  It wasn't bad, but a wedge salad does not sound any where close to a chopped salad but overall the food made up for it.  

I would come here again if I'm ever in town, but I can't lie, I'm still open to trying Hugo.  I do really appreciate that this place opens til 11pm though.",q8DpClBORerI6CGWIOOfAw,26,24,4,zjiiS7pcZypkS52N5tNsOA
2596707,2014-06-13,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"One of the best restaurant experiences I have had. We had two waiters assigned to our table of 8 - Danny and Miguel. Both very professional and knowledgeable about their food. One of their specialties is their homemade pasta by the Italian chef. For those of us getting entrees not including pasta, a special side dish was presents to 5 of us as a treat to sample. It was amazing. 

One of our party is gluten-free and she was able to pick any of the pasta entrees and just sub the gluten-free pasta. Basket of bread was my lease favorite part of the meal - a little well done for my taste, but the cheese bread sticks were yummy. Homemade olive tapenade plated instead of butter, but butter was pleasantly presented upon request. 

We had a special birthday in our party and they treated her accordingly with song and the most wonderful piece of cheesecake.  Try to save room for dessert.  All our choices were great and the presentation on the plate only added to it.

It is important to me to have access to fine dining when I go out since I'm old and that's what old people do.  When we walked into the restaurant, we were immediately impressed.  It's beautiful.  We were seated in a booth, which I usually don't like, but these booths are great.  They're circular with high backs, providing a lot of privacy and making conversation easy.
We were greated very quickly after being seated, and the delicious cocktails we ordered were served within minutes of our arrival.  This is a pet peeve of mine, so that got things off to a good start.
One of my guests ordered a steak, and the other ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and ceasar salad, and they were both very pleased.  I ordered the fish, which was fileted table side.  I was pleased, too, but I think it would be better if they moved on from butter and used olive oil.  It was a wonderful piece of fish, but butter sauce is too old school, even for a steakhouse.  Perhaps I should have requested the olive oil, but I didn't.
Tony served us, and did a great job.  He was attentive without being a pest.  He brought out a couple of small ""compliments of the chef"" dishes that were great, too.

Waiting staff and servers were top notch and very helpful. Our server Ioan, was charming and it was obvious he loved his job. The food was first rate.

Wife and I love to share at high end restaurants so we ordered three courses to share. Oysters to start. They were very good. I'd say go lite on the champagne provided to pour over the top of oysters, while tasty we found it to be over-powering, losing some of the flavor.  Second we had Caesar salad. Before you wonder why order a Caesar salad when you can get that anywhere, this is 100% authentic Caesar salad and it is prepared table side. Helps that our waiter told an excellent story while preparing the dish. Before the main course diners are treated to a signature bite of pasta that is absolutely scrumptious. Reminded me of one of my favorite comfort foods; tomato soup and grilled cheese. Lobster and Filet Mignon were our main course. We also ordered spinach and asparagus as sides to balance out the meal. The filet mignon was mouth-watering and delicate, but what made it so incredible was a soy-butter sauce that was drizzled over the cut, absolutely to die for. Lobster was prepared just right, not well done by any means. I would recommend both the spinach and asparagus sides to anyone dining here. The balsamic vinaigrette and caramelized pearl onions that topped the asparagus elevated the dish to something you savored. Fans of steamed spinach will not want to miss out either. Being our anniversary we were comped a deliciously delicate tiramisu. Lastly, we ordered two espressos that came with cute rock candy stirrers. Rich coffee that put an excellent cap on a perfect dinning experience.

For couples, I highly recommend asking for a booth, very intimate and worth the wait. Whether you are staying near the Fremont Experience or down on the Strip, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is well worth a shot. It is as good at any high-end restaurant in one of the pricey hotels on the strip.",GwYWC2Ac63xcbq9nvlWQoQ,0,0,5,qoTvEHwtZO0QqX6e2M_htg

Maybe it is the best, except for three things - location, location, and location.  If you happen to be staying downtown, you really can't do any better.  But if you're a local like me, driving downtown and parking at the D Hotel is not the first thing you think of if you're going out to dinner.

Once you get in the doors, though, food, service, and ambiance are all excellent.  I started with the Arancini - a creative idea that was well executed.  Next, I had the lobster bisque, which was one of the better lobster bisques I have had in Vegas.  And then, the bone-in rib eye which was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  The house signature steak sauce was a perfect accompaniment.  I probably should have had the roasted or baked potato - the whipped potatoes with truffles had a bit too much truffle for my taste.  But that's a small gripe and my own fault.

My wife had the shrimp cocktail, the Caprese salad, and a lobster-pasta special, and she described everything as being ""just wonderful.""

The staff was not only knowledgeable and helpful, but also very friendly and chatty.  Our server, Louis, was the very model of what high-end service ought to be.  The room was also very comfortable in an ""old Vegas"" kind of style, and would have been moderately quiet (considering that the place was full to the gills), except for the noise of the casino coming through the doors.

What we ordered

Meatballs - Bomb
Caprese - Fresh buffalo mozeralla from Italy amazing

Dinner

Tomahawk Steak! Huge piece tender, right off the skillet

Bone in Ribeye


Dessert

Tiramisu
Kit Kat Explosion


What really excited me that both steaks didnt have any butter on them, a light rub of olive oil.
Didn't feel lethargic after the meal. Our server indicated that every cow they butcher has electronic identification and they butcher in house and dry age for a long period of time.

We got all dressed up, and the waitress we got was super nice. The food was really good. We got the Caesar Salad, where the dressing is made fresh table-side, and it was delicious. We both got steaks, medium-well. They were a little over-cooked, but most expensive steakhouses can't cook anything above medium without messing it up, so I'm not docking points for that. They were kind enough to bring us out a small bowl of pasta as we awaited our steaks, and the waitress checked on us regularly.
My only complaint was about the mashed potatoes. They're an expensive side, they're dry, and taste pretty horrible, all of which can be attributed to the inclusion of truffle oil. 
Be prepared to spend some money while you're there, my bill for my gf and I (including about 22% tip) was about $140.",QuwFfTmb2LFla0vS3ZbKgw,0,0,4,YXRXd-HMQGYuijva2qmz0Q

Andiamo was a solid spot for me to visit when I lived in Michigan because of the atmosphere, quality and reasonable pricing.  You definitely get all 3 over at The D.  The restaurant has a very small entrance at the top of the 2nd floor which opens up to the dining room.  

We grilled our server on his favorite dishes, trying to find what he thought was ""excellent"" vs. ""good"".  I settled on the Potato Gnocchi w/ meat sauce as it is listed as the house specialty.  While the portion was a little smaller than I hoped, the quality of each potato stuffed bite was really good and the meat sauce was an excellent compliment.

Most of the pasta dishes are in the $20-30 range and are well worth the upgrade from other places around town in the $15-20 range.  The staff is very attentive and is dressed professionally and I noticed a Caesar salad being made table side across the room.

If you are looking for an upscale night out downtown, I highly reccomend it and look forward to trying more of the pasta dishes as well as their steak!",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,3,0,5,eaRBd-DGKhO9h5dcY6bBJA

I live in southern California, yet I make it a point to dine at this place any time I am in Vegas.  We have great dining options in San Diego County, yet we always reserve a special dinner for Andiamo.  What makes Andiamo so special?

Customer service is the first reason that comes to mind.  John was our server the first time we dined here and did a great job.  We had the pleasure of Carl helping guide our second meal here and have made it a point that he takes the reins of every dining adventure at Andiamo since then.  With his knowledge and passion for food and wine Carl has the ability to make our dinner an epic one.  Impeccable service, a great sense of humor and an attitude that makes us feel comfortable and welcome.  The hostesses Roxanna and Elma are always sweet and very accommodating, even when our party is running late.  The manager Ulisis makes it a point to visit with us at least once every meal.

Now for the tasty treats that encourage us to eat until it hurts...

Drinks: Great wine list with enough variety to accommodate anyone.  Bottles 212, 234 and 226 were very good.

Appetizers were great.  The fresh bread with eggplant caponata is a must try.  Over the past few meals we have ordered the imported meats and cheeses (Great with wine), crab and lobster ""Louis"" (avocado mousse ties this together perfectly), steamed mussels (light and just enough white wine and garlic) and sausage and peppers (very tasty with al little spice).

Salads were great.  Tried the table side Caesar (very lightly dressed) and Martha's Vineyard salad (bold flavors).

Entrees have been phenomenal.  I have tried several steaks, and all have been cooked to perfection.  I always pair them with the balsamic glaze and chipollini onions.  I have also enjoyed the veal osso bucco, veal all' Aldo and Sea Scallops entrée.  Lobster risotto, Fruitti de Mare (So much shellfish) and tortellaci have been my wife's favorites.

Desserts are ridiculously decedent.  From the Andiamo Kit Kat to the must try Italian wedding cake. 

Cleanliness: A+

Décor and ambiance was awesome, it's nice to sit in your secluded booth and take it all in while listening to some lounge tunes.

Die restaurant is a bit hidden on the 2nd floor. If you do to know where to go, you will not find it. It is to the right of the hotel escalators. There is a long dark hallway and you check in with the host.

Tip: You NEED reservations! The restaurant is not big at all so even the bar might be full. 

We ordered the bone in rib eye and 2 sides, the sides to cost extra. About $10 a piece.
We ordered the truffle mashed patties and fries (can you say carbs?)

The truffle mashed potatoes were to DIE for. I mean... I did die and went to truffle heaven. Very much worth the price. The fries were very tasty too.

But the meat, oh the meat. ODE to the cow that gave her/his life to provide this piece of herself to carnivore like ourselves. 
We treated the meat with utter respect, we tasted, we closed our eyes, we were in heaven!

If you are looking for a TOP NOTCH restaurant, go here. It is beyond greatness.

She changed how I view a night out with my husband. She has made our special night once a month or so incredible special and happy. Just to walk in and see her smile and happiness makes my entire night and we talk about our weekend the entire month anticipating the next time we get to go again. She is one of the if not the reason we keep going back again and again bringing all our family and friend when they come to visit also. we used to always go from restaurant to restaurant trying new things. Who would have ever thought we would find the perfect to spot. THIS IS IT. The incredible food. entire wait staff and of course Sandy. When you make your reservation you have to request her. She has been there forever and is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. Enjoy, I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.",K4chTpVCtObLB4E0ycbANg,0,0,5,zSeZTpKEKWlbqpM0__DA1w

I can not understand how this place garners such rave reviews. I challenge anyone to compare the steak here to absolutely any other strip casino steakhouse there is no way this diner beats any of those.

Do not enter and continue the scam this place has been perpetuating. Run far away from this place and the casino it resides in. 

Now for the food, I ordered the 20 oz ribeye medium rare and my wife ordered the filet. We had some wait ahead of us apparently they had to raise the cattle then slaughter it before they could prepare it for our dinner. After a good hour after we ordered my wife had the audacity to ask why our food was taking so long when she was admonished that ""it hasn't been very long at all mam"". 

Excuse us for breathing the oxygen inside your  diner but according to all of the history of the universe taking over an hour to cook two steaks to medium rare is a very long wait time.

Now here comes the clincher, both steaks were extremely well done and drier then the Last Vegas summers. Shocked I tell you!

Once again we had the outrageous behaviour of deciding to complain about the plight of our dinner experience and we were quickly threatened. So we cut up the steaks to take pictures but we're asked to leave not before we were once again threatened to pay our bill. I will find any site I can on the internet to share my horrible experience and if it comes to it I will picket this trash place to exact my revenge.",xEPwYdAySEMffMg7S3jXBQ,0,0,1,EtV8CVVy5oe8u3bZyEqmEA

My hubby had the porterhouse. He enjoyed it, however, gave it a 7/10, found it under seasoned. John recommended both entrees, which we took him up on considering we were leaning towards pricier entrees. I figured if he was willing to suggest something cheaper, it was worth the try.  For our sides, we had the mashed potatoes and the grilled asparagus. The mashed potatoes were not good. They tasted like boxed mashed potatoes and had the same texture.

I'm one for giving someone a little grace as the place was packed. To make up for his mistake, our server went overboard from their on out. We had the tossed Caesar salad, made at our table which was a killer. I could have made that my meal, perhaps I should have as I'm on a diet.....nah it's Vegas.

Here is my Hollywood review:

I could not believe that Andiamo's had my favorite white ever!  White Haven Sauvignon Blanc!  Fabulous way to start the meal!  Calamari with marinara for the appetizer.  

We shared the 'made at the table caesar salad', and sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes.   Everything was grand!

They delivered all of our steaks and we were so happy.  Then, I cut into my filet.

I orded it ""black and blue"".  My steak was medium rare.  

Sigh.  Suck.  But, I am not the person to send my food back.  I am so afraid they are gong to spit on it, etc.

Our server, Mergim, heard me say that my steak was over done.  He jumped on that immediately.  

""No, No, No.""  Yes, yes, yes, Mergim said.

Oh Mah Gawd.  They brought out the most beautiful black and blue filet I have had since Mr. TeeJay bbq'd for me in July.

3577035,2015-08-17,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"The best steakhouse I've been to, period.

Andiamo is located upstairs at The D.  It's kind of in an odd place next to the bathrooms and I've been in The D a dozen times and have never noticed it.  I play upstairs a lot and I even go to the bathrooms right by it and never noticed.

Anyway, the setting is really nice.  Very dark, very clean -- kind of gives this ""old Vegas"" vibe but in a modern setting.  Anyway we were seated quickly and given some bread.  The bread was nothing special (Fuego at Fiesta Henderson is still #1 in this category).  Our server, Miguel, was well known to me after reading other Yelp reviews.  He was great from start to end.

We ordered the mozzarella cube appetizer, the 12 ounce filet mignon with zip sauce (split), and sides of french fries and meatballs.  They gave us a small dish of angel hair pasta in a nice sauce -- Miguel said we could not come to an Italian restaurant without getting some pasta.  It was amazing. I don't even know if it's on the menu but I'd gladly order a big plate of that by itself.  There was no charge for this.

The mozzarella cube appetizer was quite good.  A little overpriced for 6 smallish cubes of fried mozzarella, but they were good and the sauce had a nice bacon flavor.  We split the steak and they were nice enough to give us separate plates so we didn't have to split it ourselves.  The steak was awesome, but the zip sauce made it that much better.  I can only describe it as an au jus/gravy concoction.  There was no charge for splitting, which was also very nice!

The french fries were the best fries I've ever had.  I'm usually not a fan of shoestring fries but oh man they were so good.  Lastly regarding the side of meatballs I'll note you can get a meatball appetizer which is just one big meatball with ricotta on top of it, or you can get the side of meatballs which is two small meatballs with no ricotta.  The meatballs were actually rather boring.  

Service was great.  Had people checking on us and refilling drinks as appropriate, and not annoyingly often.   Total bill was only $93.  Even though the bread and meatballs were underwhelming, the quality of service, the huge menu, as well as how good the steak and fries were merit giving this place 5 stars.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,2,0,5,I-JbAZjtObRbEYxNMCvKVA

   Our waiter, whose name was Bart, was very good natured and even okay with us making Simpson's jokes (what can I say, we are fans from the 90's).

You will know what I mean if you go there, trust me.   The D Hotel was a bit dark and depressing with clientele that looked like something from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (no offense to any fans of the D or to Honey Boo Boo...and what does the D stand for anyway? I could get creative, but I will stop).  Eek!  

When you find Andiamo nestled back in a smoky corner on the second level, you walk into an entirely different world.  White linens, romantic lighting, cozy booths, ""Sinatra"" smooth and classy setting.  We had a large party and they rose to the occasion and we were all amazed at the service before any food was even consumed.  

We started with the infamous Meatball and it was pretty good, nothing out of this world, but good.  We shared a few other appetizers that were good as well.  Then the steak came, and WOW!  Everyone at the table stated that this was the best steak they had ever had.  Now, we are Midwesterners, true meat connoisseurs, so this was a quite a moment.  Cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth, like butter...

We've been pretty happy with how The D has been taking care of us, and read some reviews for Andiamo since we were going to be staying there again.  The reviews were pretty positive, including some good reviews from the local press.  Last Saturday, we arrived shortly after 5pm for an early dinner after skipping lunch.  The place definitely has a throwback elegance to it-- think dark wood paneling, tall leather booths, and dim lighting.  We were seated straight away.

We were so lucky to have Joan as our waiter (pronounced yo-AN), a Romanian expatriate who's been in the restaurant biz since his teen years.  For those of you that truly appreciate a real professional, Joan is the real deal.  So much of what made this meal such a great experience was his attention, expertise, and professionalism.  One of the best-- this guy is a treasure.

The menu is extensive, and Joan augmented it with the list of the nights specials; we sipped some Tanquerey and perused the menu.  We got some delicious in-house made bread, served with a great tapenade (a nice change of pace from the usual oil and vinegar or cold bricks of butter).  For our first course we had the calamari (very fresh, lightly fried up and served with a zippy marinara) and the Caesar salad.  

This is REAL Caesar salad, made tableside with impeccably fresh ingredients-- egg yolks, anchovy fillets, the works.  I've found that finding a real Caesar salad is something of a task, and this is the best I've had.  The balance of the creamy egg to the umami-laden anchovy, the Dijon, the Worchestershire, the cheese-- all perfect.  I could eat that salad every night.

We decided on the specials-- Joe ordered the Sea Bass on a fried pea risotto cake, and I got the special cioppino (not the one on the menu).  The Sea Bass was top shelf, beyond fresh and cooked perfectly.  It was a very generous cut of fish, he couldn't  finish the accompanying fritter (though, the impromptu pasta course that came out compliments of the chef before the main courses probably had something to do with that).  The cioppino was stellar and chock full of quality seafood, namely the two large langoustines that were in the center of the bowl.  The langoustines were amazing, and accompanied by a slew of clams and mussels, prawns, crab, fish, and two very important slices of deliciously salty grilled bread for the broth.  Seriously fantastic-- I've not had better.  

We sadly did not have room to sample the dessert offerings, but that just gives us something to look forward to for next time.  We will definately be back, as long as Joan is working that night!  Try it-- after too many disappointing meals on the Strip, we are glad we gave this place a try and found a real gem!",ZFphO2QnjHQdyNghJW_FGQ,2,0,5,bppmO52aJ2_tmtqSqs0ZOg

The room is very nicely done.  I was at one of two tables along a wall that sat two people.  A server came to me and started explaining the specials having told me that my waiter wasn't yet there.  As the first one was explaining the specials, my server appeared.  The first one continued and then they let me study the menu.  In the meantime, a runner brought my iced tea.

I was set to have a steak but when I learned the pasta special for last night was orecchiette, that's what I ordered.  I ordered a small portion of calamari for an appetizer and I got a side of meatballs (2 small) with dinner.

Bread was brought to the table.  It was a nice selection of a cheese brea, salted bread sticks, and some crostini.  Instead of butter, Andiamo serves a very good eggplant caponata with olives for use on the bread bruschetta style.  

The calamari came quickly and it was a good sized plate even if it was a small order.  The marinara served with the calamari was quite good.

The orecchiette was fairly good.  It was a bit too al dente.  There were small cubes of meet and some peas in the orecchiette and the sauce was good.  It did need some salt.  The side of meatballs were good.  Again, the sauce was good.

The server pushed the dessert cart to my table and I went with a coconut cake.  There seemed to be a difference of opinion as to what it was.  My server said it was a lime, coconut cake and another server told the woman seated at the next table that it was Key lime pie.  Regardless, the fruit flavor was very light.  The coconut was the star.

Salty to the point that it makes your face cringe. So i thought it was just me, so i had my friends try it and they said the same thing. Come to find out there food was salty too. Told the waiter that it was salty and his response was"" i never heard of that"" I then proceeded and asked him if he wants to try it and taste all the salt. He said no. But he did not do anything about the fact that our food was salty. His response should of been. Oh would you like us to remake it  or order something different. He did nothing. Our bill for 3 people was $130. For the waiter not doing anything. He did not get no tip. I would never recommend this place.

I ended up here for a work meeting on Wednesday night because the lighting at nearby Vic & Anthony's is far too dim to read by.  I made a reservation for 3, and despite arriving a little late, we were seated right away.  The privacy we requested was easily accommodated by the big booth that basically encloses your group.  The lighting was much better than Vic's and we were able to review documents and discuss work without any interruptions.  We did manage to enjoy ourselves though.  

Now let's talk about the goods.  Service was flawless from start to finish.  Our waiter looked like he stepped out of the pages of a Little Italy tour book.  He was authentic Italian New Yorker and very helpful.  When we asked for antipasto suggestions, he recommended the sausage and peppers.  I would never have ordered this otherwise, and this dish was amazing!  Spicy grilled peppers, onions and homemade sausage.  Had a great spiciness that was tempered by the sweetness of the peppers.  I had the tableside Caesar salad (2 people must order), mainly because I just love seeing anything prepared at the table.  In addition to the fun presentation, the salad was probably one of the best caesars I've ever had.  Instead of chopping up the romaine, you get full romaine leaves which are tossed in the homemade dressing (made right in front of you) and the croutons are very fresh.  Definitely a must.  

For my entrée, I had the 8 oz filet.  It was perfectly cooked, but by this point, I had to box half of it because I was stuffed.  We also ordered the truffled potatoes as a side dish.  I thought they were incredibly rich, but delicious.  Wonderful experience.  At the risk of being struck by lightning, if you are in the neighborhood, I may have to recommend Joe Vicari's over Hugo's Cellar.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,4,3,5,QUHkCeD8xW51u7qNIcB2pg

Service: Fantastic from beginning to end.  Drinks were always fresh, and table was always ready for the upcoming course.  Our waitress was fantastic!  So friendly and very sweet and knew her stuff.   Great recommendations!  She definitely enhanced our dining experience.

Food: They offered a prime rib special and it was one of the best decisions I've made all year.  20+ ounces of medium rare blissfulness.  Prepped and cooked perfectly, best prime rib I've had in 2017 easily.  It's my current screen saver on my phone, but I digress.  We got warmed up with the pork shoulder and it was very tasty.  All the following sides were made with high end ingredients that kept the flavors rich: Escargot. mushrooms, asparagus tips and the whipped potatoes.  Did I mention that the Prime Rib was lovely? Separation anxiety kicking in..

Ambiance: High End old school steakhouse decor with lots of bricks, wood and leather around.  The brick tunnel entrance with runway lights was very cool.  High end utensils and plates made it easy to enjoy the food.  Dimly lit to keep the mood intimate but social.  Noisy because the place is packed but not overbearing.  Great place to start a ""dress up"" evening out.

I'm already looking forward to the next yummy visit.  This is a great steakhouse to celebrate a special dinner and is now a go to for $$$ restaurants in the downtown area.

Made a reservation, arrived at the time reserved and were promptly seated. Not a very large place. Had an old school atmosphere with all of the waiters in white dinner jackets.
As I have been known to do, we started with a few cocktails to help us go over their menu offerings.
Here is what we ordered. A type of Kale / Farro salad. A Wedge salad (for me, I like old school) Frutti di Mare, and a bone-in rib-eye.
The salads were pretty good with the wedge being a bit different from the standard but was still good. On the entrees.......they were just ok. The steak was good but was definitely not prime beef but priced as high as prime. The Frutti di Mare was only ok too. 

This may sound strange but they had the most awesome breadsticks I ever had. They were about as thin as a pencil and had something on them or in them that made me want more.

People here wrote highly of their wait service but we did not experience it. Our waiter seemed distracted and was more interested in a larger group table that he was helping out on.

Andiamo is supposed to be known for their steaks. As such, I should not have had to send back my steak because it was not cooked to the temperature I preferred. I asked for medium, but it came very pink and bloody. It came back a few minutes later slightly better and yet still bloody and definitely not medium. Come on! Really? On top of which, I found the steak and the sauce they poured over the meat to be flavorless.

My lovely wife ordered crab legs and was promptly told they did not have enough for a full order. She opted for a plate which combined a lobster tail and two crab legs-all of which were well overcooked, dry, and we found out later was priced at $105. That was a hefty price for food that is usually prepared better at much less pricier chain restaurants.

Just before our steak, lobster, and crab legs came, we were given a complimentary pasta which my wife sadly described as nothing better than a can of Spaghetti O's. This place, I thought is an Italian Steakhouse.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place.",TJh6-xG-R1W2i020lqr3kQ,3,0,2,3mjjLGqrJ9Nl3txC51neXQ

Bradley, is the general manager. Very proper, cares about his workplace and it shows. Came over to say hi and let me compliment his place of business and of course out main man Danny.


Pete, is a local (yet Hawaiian) guy who just made my night. He wasn't even helping our table. But he saw we needed help and he was there. So thank you Pete.

Every person here is a cog in this great grandfather clock. Jewell movement. I adore this place and I can't wait to come back for another cut of a different steak.

I served tables in various restaurants for almost ten years, so I am very appreciative of great service. We never waited for a drink or refill, and he was always around to check on us. He even offered to take a picture of us without us asking! 

As far as food goes.. I am still in awe of how flavorful and tender my filet mignon was. I am a huge steak fanatic, and I can honestly say that I have never tasted a more delicious steak. I'm not sure what the ""zip sauce"" had in it, but it paired so well with the cut of meat! I was seriously on cloud 9. We also ordered dessert after our meal, and my fiance had asked Jhonny if he could possibly put a candle in it since it was my birthday. Not only did our server bring us the dessert we ordered, he brought ANOTHER dessert with a candle at no charge to us!

I must disagree.  Table side Caesar is great, but too much dressing.  Escargot on mushrooms creates a taste of only mushroom & butter.  Escargot is lost even if u eat it w/out the mushroom.  Veal chop was delicious.  Bone-in ribeye was good, but it was covered in butter & sauce to drown out the steak flavor.  Andiamo needs to learn to not drown their food in ketchup or mayo or go.  It's no fun to eat what u can't even see, so don't drown your food.  Ambiance is good, dark & quiet enough when at full capacity.  One problem is temperature is high & needs to be controlled.

We were actually struggling locating it in the casino and a pleasant young gentlemen in the janitorial crew assisted us to the location. The entire time he was talking about how wonderful the restaurant was and how impressed we will be since it was our first time dining there. We went inside and announced our name and reservation. They gave away our table. Granted we were 12 minutes late, but it is Las Vegas traffic, it is hard to predict what is going to happen when you step into a vehicle. They lead us to the bar assuring it would only be a 10 to 15 minute wait. My fiance was upset and let them know of his displeasure, he had worked at several fine dining establishments and it is a standard practice in most places to hold a table for 15 minutes. They retrieved our group from the bar only 5 minutes later and gave us an amazing table (honestly was probably the best seat in the house in our opinion). The night was saved. 

Service: Our server Miguel was fantastic. His passion for his job was abundantly clear, and he could tell you anything about that drink and dinner menu. He was on top of his game the entire evening. He recommended a few wines for us and gave us additional information on the wine that we chose to order while serving it to us. He even let us save the cork.


Food: My fiance and I split the lobster bisque and it was divine. So much flavor packed into every mouthful. The chunks of lobster on top were insanely tender and fresh. I had the chilean seabass entree, and it was cooked quite well (a tad bit over). I felt the dish was missing a bright note, maybe some citrus or fresh herbs perhaps? Half the table had the Paglia e Fieno and the Tortellaci Guiseppe, and agreed it was fresh, handmade, savory and perfectly sauced. The last member of our group had the veal osso bucco. It was the best dish of the night. Sooooo much flavor and he gave me the bone marrow. I smeared that all over a piece of bread from their complimentary bread basket (the best bread basket I've had in a while) and was in heaven. Best bone marrow I've had to date, hands down.

Wedge Salads with Blue Cheese, sliced red onion and egg are authentic and absolutely delicious. 

Shrimp Cocktail well they are fine, nothing special. 

Escarole with sausage is outstanding

Italian Sausage & Peppers with Marinara base also a big hit at the table. 

Where do things go a little south well the Steaks especially for the price points were disappointing. 

Various cuts of meat were tried
Rib Eye - 
NY Strip
Filet Mignon 
All of them were good don't get me wrong  but there are cuts of prime beef then there are well disappointing cuts of prime beef.   Their char was non existent and they simply did not get the job done and when your are talking about steaks at 60$ plus per steak they better ring the bell. 

With that said sides of baked potato, asparagus and fingerling potatoes with onions were simply fare.    

Complimentary platter of pasta in pink sauce thank you for the platter but pasta was over cooked and sauce ""PINK"" very bland. 

2 tiramisu for the table were excellent. 

Quite a bit of wait between entrees and appetizers, not servers fault as they were TOP SHELF all night.

Service was very poor at first, but picked up after we ordered a bottle of wine. Something to note is the vintages are actually 2-3 years later than what's printed on the menu - hone in, high roller. We finished with a nice port and mediocre creme brulee.

Our group: 11 girls celebrating a bachelorette party. The service was flawless every step of the way. That is nothing short of a miracle when you put a gaggle of hens together and start feeding them extra dirty martinis. 

Since it's not very adult to solely have vodka and blue cheese olives for dinner, I split several dishes around the table. Sharing is caring. We had Italian wedding soup, lobster bisque, portabella & tenderloin tips, lobster-black truffle baked ziti, and caesar salad. A couple girls also split steaks, including the NY Strip with cajun spices special. Holy. It was all absolutely delicious. Note: the caesar has a two guest minimum and is prepared table side. I highly recommend starting your meal with the Italian wedding soup. We all ended our meals with espressos and sambuccas.

So I spent my dining experience sitting next to some dude with his ball cap on backwards....can't make that kind of stuff up.

Service was quick without smothering and our server was very friendly and offered good suggestions on the menu and sides. I had the house salad and it was chopped up very small with a lite dressing. My wife had the wedge salad and it was huge and very good. My mom had the chopped salad and it was a good size and also very tasty. I had the porterhouse and it was cooked perfectly. The strip and filet sides were perfect and tasty. My mom had the filet and asked them to butterfly it as she likes it cooked medium well. Steak was done to her liking. My wife had veal ravioli and they were really good. Sauce was a little rich but very tasty. For sides we had asparagus and French fries. The asparagus had a sauce or something on them, was good but couldn't place the flavor. We were thinking about dessert but they only have 1 dessert tray I guess cause it took so long we had to just get the check because we had show tickets next door.

  Ok, here's my rant (almost pulled one star, but couldn't do it):  I am at a $100/meal, high-end steak house for a nice meal with my family.  We are all dressed appropriately for a night of fine dining.  Why in the heck do nice restaurants in Vegas NOT HAVE A DANG DRESS CODE??!!  It ruins the atmosphere when NASCAR Bubba and his gang pour into the place wearing shorts, wife beaters and flip-flops.  You can't get into many clubs in Vegas with nice sneakers, but this is ok?

While there are several good appetizers available if you are not quite that hungry you still can have a first course of their spaghetti and bread with a wonderful eggplant copanata. The filet mignon, my wife's favorite is melt in your mouth goodness. I can wholeheartedly recommend the ribeye and both become very special with the house zip sauce.

Funny, Hugo somewhat dismissed my question about the Pappardelle with Veal Ragu...""It's just a pasta dish..."" (I ordered it anyway) but he was much happier with my wife's order - the 8 oz filet rare+  with white truffle whipped potatoes.  Both meals were beautifully plated and smelled incredible.  My pasta was delicious and exactly what I was craving - rich, earthy veal stew over homemade pasta.  I needed it after 3 nights of chichi, foodie dinners.  My wife's filet made clear to me what Hugo meant by ""It's just a pasta dish...""  It was absolutely the FINEST PIECE OF BEEF either of us have ever eaten (I knew she wouldn't eat it all)!  It was cooked to complete perfection (which is rare when you like rare+) with a perfect char and barely warm, juicy, amazingly tender inside.  The flavor was AMAZING - just yummy, yummy, yummy beef perfectly seasoned with only salt and pepper.  A truly great steak starts with high quality beef, and I've cooked and been served lots of prime, dry-aged, grass fed, etc. beef...and I will say again, the filet from Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse was absolutely the finest beef we have ever eaten.  The fact we thought so delighted Hugo.  He is VERY proud of their beef and he should be!  You can spend more money on a world class steak dinner on the Strip, but you won't get get a better steak.

From there - everything was perfect.  The service, the food (We had a Porterhouse Steak and the Veil), the atmosphere, and the amount we paid (we luckily had a $100 food voucher provided by ""The D"".  Although that didn't cover the entire bill by any means, but it will still worth it.  

In all honesty - 2 of us could have almost split one meal (although almost everything is al le carte), the servings are that large.  For people with a bit appetite, you'll get along just fine.

4934493,2014-05-19,4,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"I was very excited to try Andiamo.  My friends from out of town were wanting either Italian or American cuisine, so I thought what better way than to try out a new restaurant, in the new downtown area at a hotel with a hip reputation, and why not experience the revolution of new culture downtown!

The Experience - 3 Star - The valet parking at the D is great, attentive and quick. For a small service area with limited space for cars, I find the valets were doing a great job balancing everything.  As soon as you park, you enter the casino and you are immediately hit with both loud music from the hotel's music system and strong whiff of stale cigarette smoke!  Then you are immediately dumped into the video and slot machine area, so there was really no transition from the valet to the hotel, it was just bang in your face with the sound and smell.  I found that to be a bit distracting.  The journey to the restaurant is also a bit like any other hotel casino, you have to wade through the casino floor and interesting signage to get to the restaurant.  

The dancers - 3 star - On our sojourn through the desert of this casino floor, methinks I was seeing an oasis as when you trek past the blinking and ching-a-linging of the slots to the table games, there are scantily cald dealers and table dancing dealers? This was totally unexpected and very cool at first glance.  This brings a certain element on this expedition, yet the vacuous stare of the dancers was kind of disheartening and left me a feeling like when you discover that your oasis is well, an oasis...

The arrival - 2.5 stars - Going up the escalator to Andiamo, you can turn right off the elevator and smack right into the restrooms, or turn left onto the second level casino floor which was odd.  This is a bit of a no brainer to go left to the spacious area.  Again, my navigation skills after the table dancing oasis were very poor tonight and I turned right.  If you were really paying attention, you would find that Andiamo is tucked into a small alley way next to the toilets with tons of toilet traffic.  The good news is that once you enter the brick tunnel entrance, you feel that you are being transported through a catacomb from the loud and boisterous babble of toilet traffic to the enticing smells and taste of the restaurant.  The arrival finally was itself great, the journey was worth the trip.

The service - 5 star - What you get right away upon entering Andiamo is a five star service. From the front reception, to being seated and then by being greeted by your server, this place is classy all the way. We were fortunate to have John as our server and his white tux was reminiscent of the movie Casablanca.  

The food - 4 star - We had a variety of food here.

Appetizers - 5 star The grilled portabella mushroom was awesome and almost steak like  Served with beef tenderloin tips, I really enjoyed this dish. The banana peppers and sausage was one of the most unique and intriguing appetizers. I would highly recommend it. The caprese was tasty, although the rather large slices were, rather large.  Getting mozzarella di bufala is great and this was no exception.

Main Course - 3.5 star - We ordered the bone in ribeye, the Osso Bucco, Veal all' Aldo which was a cut of veal pounded and topped with prosciutto and cheese.  We also had the filet.  I had the Osso Bucco which was  good over a fettuccine pasta.  The look was amazing, the marrow was great, the meat and pasta were good but somewhat overwhelming.  Not sure, but very rich.  Most of us did not finish our dishes.

The sides - 3 star - Tuscan Roasted potatoes and creme spinach. The potatoes were tasty and extremely HOT in temperature. The creme spinach was uneventful. 

Dessert - 4 star - shared the tiramisu, a chocolate cassata cake. Very good.

Overall, an interesting journey and a trek to get there. The food was good, very high quality overall, however, I would say not entirely memorable. The ambiance of the restaurant was very intimate in a way, but with very oddly positioned tables, too close to others, constant movement of servers too near you, and just too busy for an intimate setting. I am so glad I tried the place, i would suggest everyone try it Probably one of the best upscale places to eat in Downtown area. On par with Oscar's restaurant at the Plaza. 

I gave this place a three star overall and it could easily be a 4 star if I was in the right frame of mind perhaps.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,9,4,3,gmWVGbuSDCCghYWZMYDvFw

I dined at Joe Vicari's Friday evening for my lovely friends birthday celebration! We scored one of their stylish, enclosed, chocolate leather booths with dim lighting. The overall service was terrific, our server was fast,  tremendously efficient and kind! Sadly, my food did not merit  4+ stars.
-Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes $25 great portion size, moist and delicious! By far the best item ordered!!!!
-Lobster Bisque $12 mediocre soup with a tablespoon of lobster ""crumbs"".
-Calamari Fritti- $15 meh. 
Caesar Salad $12 the table side preparation was kind of neat! 
-Lobster Risotto $36 I can't recall ever sending a meal back to the kitchen until this evening. My friends and I agreed of all the food ordered this was by far the worst dish ever! The ""lobster meat"" was extremely over cooked and tough. I honestly can't even describe the risotto; it was just that bad. 
-Lobster-Black Truffle Baked Ziti $16 I was way to busy chugging water after sampling my disgusting pasta I neglected to try the ziti. The portion is HUGE definitely shareable. My friend was extremely dissatisfied with her ziti. After a few bites she gave up due to the extremely fishy lobster taste. 
My other friend ordered some special seafood pasta of the day. She loved it and it was her birthday so I guess that's a win!

We have (now) 3 high end steakhouses down here...VVIc & Anthony's, Oscars, and Andiamo.

I've always found Oscar's kind of gimmicky, while I love  V&A's. But this place is one or two notches above.

It has a hip vibe (2013 hip, not 1940s hip). We were greeted nicely and seated immediately in a booth that may as well have been a private room, what with the 7 foot high banquette forming 335 degrees of a circle.

Service was quick and spectacular....observant but not obsequious. Caesar was made table side, and the fresh anchovies gave just the right of bite. The steaks are spectacular..I'm not sure how they age them, and who their purveyor is, but they rank very, very high in flavor and tenderness.

As my wife isn't a wine drinker, I didn't pay much attention to the by-the-bottle list, but the by-the-glass selections were all fantastic. My only complaint is that they had no Zins by the glass, so I settled for a beautiul Cab.

The deserts goiing by on the cart (repeatedly) looked gorgeous, so we had to splurge. We had a creme brulee (let's face it a well done brulee is a well done brulee...there's only so far you can go) a dessert called ""Kit Kat"" which is a homemade, delicious version of the execrable candies, and the most amazing chocolate cake with ganache frosting

Located in the D in DTLV, it delivers a Strip like experience at off Strip prices.

Straight to it, starters.  The giant meatball is very good.  Huge, flavorful, juicy, topped with a tart ricotta and swimming in a acidic tomato sauce.  The carpaccio (everyday shaved beef topped with arugula, an excess of Parmesan and tangy mustard vinaigrette), OK.  The calamari, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside also just OK.

Next up, salads.  The caprese is as fresh and vibrant as any but it's a non Italian salad that steels the show. The table side Caesar is excellent.  Coddled egg, anchovies, freshly grated Parmesan; a classic.

It's not Italian without pasta. All freshly made in house.  The Pappardelle with veal ragu is excellent.  Flavorful and tasting like hours of low simmering created it.  

The main event, meat.  Standard steakhouse cuts.  Decently trimmed, with a mild 30 day dry aged flavor. A tomahawk and porterhouse were well seared, slightly over temp, tender, with only the lightest bleu cheese, nutty flavor.  OK naked but when paired with Detroit's famed Zip Sauce (a concoction of butter, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, rosemary, and cayenne), the flavors of the steak explode.

Standard steakhouse sides.  Good, simply grilled asparagus or roasted potatoes.  

OK wine list.  Focus on Italy.  Prices are fair.  Good service but lacking the energy you would expect from an Italian eatery.

You could tell he's very passionate about what he does and life in general. It's always nice to be able to to enjoy dinner with someone who's so great. 

For the food: 

Caeser salad. They make the salad at your table and it was great.
The meatball. They're known for it and it is worth it. It melts in your mouth and their marinara is perfect.
Bone in Ribeye. I had to get a steak at an Italian steakhouse. It was cooked perfectly with their house zip sauce. Good god alive it was great. I love aged steaks.
The seabass. The risotto it comes with is sooooo creamy and delicious. The seabass was good. We both prefer a little thicker of a filet, but it was still tasty.

Pauly also gave us pasta as a side because he said we ""had to try it."" Excellent.

To top it all off, Pauly brought us creme brulee to celebrate our anniversary. Super sweet of him and it was perfect. I'm not even a fan of creme brulee, but it was so flavorful and creamy.

I can't wait to go back and eat here again. For what this place offers, it's insanely reasonably priced. Excellent service and food. Another amazing place in the books.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,33,19,5,1atm10Qwcf3A7FWH00xIjQ

You will not be hungry when you leave, still have money in your pocket, and have some great service (thanks Miguel).  It has been a week and I am still thinking of the meal I had.  It was the best meal of the week and I am looking forward to my next trip to stop in again.  There were three of us and we had the caesar salad, steaks, mashed potatoes, mushroom and onions, the three steak sauces, and several drinks for the price of $200.  I was too full to eat any of the deserts (kit kat or chocolate cake).  I can not say enough good things about this place.

The bread and tapenade was delicious, a good start.  We went with the portabello mushroom appetizer which came with the zip sauce.  Pretty solid, I'd order it again.

I went with the bone-in-ribeye for my entree.  I will say I was disappointed in the steak by itself.  The meat stand alone felt under seasoned if it was even seasoned at all.  The side of zip sauce saved it, but sometimes it's nice to taste a ribeye by itself and get a sense of all the flavor from the marbling.  The side of cream spinach was average, I'd probably try a different side next time.

We were in a hurry so didn't order dessert but I hear the carrot cake is phenomenal so I'll put that on the list for next time.

I ordered the frutti di mare (pictured) as it was recommended by our waiter and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. They definitely don't skimp on the seafood. And the shrimp were enormous!

I don't know from who or what gave them that honor but the service to us and two or three tables around us experienced the same.  First we were a party of five, and we were easy to tend. I know this because we've gone to other restaurants of this caliber and their wasn't any problems.  At first at thought we were being discriminated because they sat us all the way in the back, but later saw other people being sat around us in the back but then realized that my waiter Jhony, and the hostess were just terrible. We paid $300+ for our bill, so when your paying 40 plus for a plate, your restaurant better be on point.  So we start, my drink was wrong twice from the start, their were absolutely ZERO items for kids in the menu, asked the waiter what was good for kids or maybe they have a hidden menu for kids and it was like pulling teeth but at the end nothing.  When ordering our food, I asked about a Caesar salad for my wife and I; he said because of the salmonella cases from and from the farms that they get it from, he'll have to check and let us know if theirs any.  I looked at my wife and said WTF.  Ten minutes later he's next to our table making the salad not asking us if we still wanted the salad after hearing that the lettuce that they get is from the contaminated farms.  Pretty crazy.......Food arrived and I was okay, no way was it worth it.  I've taken a picture of the receipt, so you can see what we got.  In between our dinner, our waiter started playing the magician game, where he disappeared and appeared later.  The other guy filling up drinks also went into hiatus too.  So, our drinks went empty and we were wanting to eat dessert but by the time we were done eating and he coming back and offered it twenty minutes later. We literally sat again without being talked to or served.  We told him we wanted our check, and that was pretty quick and charging my card was pretty fast.

Service was excellent and for the most part, so was the food, but unfortunately the signature steak was quite a let down.

Once you hang an immediate right at the top of the escalator to the upper floor of The D, you'll walk down the hallway to the host stand where you'll see the dessert cart to tease you and a classic old school dining room with some larger tables in the center and some larger circular booths lining the outside. We were seated in a small two top table that presented challenges for enough space throughout the meal. I would definitely recommend requesting seating in a booth for seclusion and for more space.

We were greeted immediately by our server and given the specials for the evening which included the ""baby tomahawk,"" which is a smaller version of the signature 32 oz tomahawk which I was eyeing but was unsure if I was ready for two pounds of beef, so I was sure the mini version would be more appropriate. Hugo provided excellent service throughout the meal. The only flaw we found was that when our salumi e formaggi board was dropped off, he didn't describe which meats and cheeses were which. We figured it out, but probably someone paying $19 for the board shouldn't have to do.

Along with the tomahawk special and the meat & cheese board, we also ordered the ciao portabella and a wedge salad for starters, the paglia e fieno for the other entree, the peanut butter bar for dessert, three glasses of wine, and an espresso. The portabello mushrooms and my wife's pasta dish were the best dishes of the night. I didn't really buy into the Zip sauce when reading about it on the menu, but it was quite tasty with the meaty, earthy mushrooms.

The ""baby tomahawk"" is where I was most disappointed. At $68 and being a chef's special for the night, I had high expectations, but the steak was a big time disappointment. First, whoever ""butchered"" my cut definitely butchered it. The flavorful cap was non existent, instead the cut was bordered by inedible gristle, not marbled meat. Second, for being dry aged for 30 days, I think I strained my masseter muscle in my jaw trying to chew the meat, especially in the eye of the cut where it was leather like. When I was almost finished, I felt like I was taking a pill and had to wash down each bolus with a swig of cab. It's a rare moment when I leave a few bites of steak on my plate unfinished.

The total for the meal was $199 before tip. I wish I could excuse them and say it was an off night for the steak, but no excuses are acceptable when the steak is your signature cut and the chef special for the night.

It was a Monday night and we didn't have reservations but were able to be seated immediately. Our server Marco was great, very friendly, informative and made great recommendations for our meal. 

We had the Cesar salad for two. It's made table side and a very large portion. Fresh, well seasoned, fresher shaved parm and croutons made for a very tasty salad. 

Hubby had the bone in rib eye with zip sauce, shaved Brussel sprouts with bacon, and I had the frutti de mare. We definitely over ordered because we were barely able to eat half our entree. Hubby didn't even touch the sprouts he was so stuffed. I just ate all the seafood and a bit of the noodles. 

We also wanted to save room for dessert. Hubby opted for the Chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and I had a cappuccino. Lava cake was warm and gooey, not overly sweet and of shareable size. My cappuccino had the perfect amount of foam and I liked the Little Rock candy sugar stick on the side. I thought that was a nice touch.  

Overall, great experience, service and food. I can see why hubby likes this place! Would definitely fine here again the next time we're in Vegas.",XOIe1VSt1PLCZO04jyXDYg,1,0,5,B5olTnmHaXiwMnBRlXTITg

1. Fried Calamari 
2. Medium rare Ribeye w/ the zip sauce on the side

Tiramisu is probably the best I've ever had in Vegas. It's made fresh w/ an amazing whipped cream on the side that's thick!

5529305,2013-10-08,13,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"Going from best to worst:

5 stars:

The service was excellent.  Our Italian waiter named ""Loan"" was totally on point from start to finish.  The tableside Caesar salad (which originated from Mexico and has nothing to do with Italy) he made was a marvel.  He made the dressing from scratch right in front of us starting with the egg yolk, spices, anchovy and everything else after.  It was so cool to watch.  He certainly wasn't modest about his tableside Caesar skills either saying he ""made it the best"" and it delivered!  This is a must order and for $9 a person is a better deal than the other salads on the menu.  

4 stars:

I am a sucker for handmade pasta but we thought ordering a full entree plate of that would be insanely too much food so we begrudgingly went with the lobster black truffle baked ziti.  This was supposed to be a side dish but it was a huge portion easily for 4 people and it was so good!  They definitely didn't skimp on the lobster meat and it made for great leftovers the next day.  

Nutfish Z's great review twisted my arm into ordering the ""Andiamo Grande Meatball"".  Just what I need right?  A meat appetizer followed by an entree of more meat!  The meatball was a little smaller than the size of a softball and was a handmade blend of veal, pork and beef.   It was a little more on the solid side and the sauce with the ricotta cheese topping really was a great blend of flavor.  Nice meatball!  This is not to be mistaken for their side dish of meatballs which is only beef and pork.   

3 stars:

We got a side order of the ""olive oil grilled asparagus with cipollini onions"" which was a nice sized portion compared to most other steakhouses.  The sauce on top was good and I like cipollini onions on pretty much anything including Fruity Pebbles.  

2 stars:

Our waiter gave us 2 surprise plates of spaghetti topped with a kind of tomato cream sauce courtesy of the chef right before our entrees came out.  It was totally unnecessary filler considering we already ordered a pasta dish and I didn't think it was very good.  I saw Ron S's photo afterward with his caption asking if the sauce came from a can.  I thought the same thing!  My wife liked it better than I did.  I know I sound like a putz complaining about free food but this wasn't needed at all and I would just set this aside if/when they give it to you before the entrees come out.  

1 star:

It pains me to even write this but it was the goddamn steak itself!!  I got the bone in ribeye (had plans to go for the Tomahawk after Teri W's great review but they have since upped the price from $65 to $79) and my wife got the filet mignon. 
 
I take my first bite and shake my head kinda like ""huh""?  I take another bite, get more perplexed and then I take a final bite from a different section, turn to my wife and say ""this is not good at all"".  The ribeye was lukewarm at best, dry and wasn't even up to par with the $13 flat iron steak I had at Herbs and Rye a few days before that.  

My wife's filet mignon was good....if you want it to taste like AHI TUNA!!!  She was surprisingly OK with it though so who was I to argue?  Loan comes back, asks how things are and I tell him my problems with the ribeye.  It was as if this quality of steak should have been saved for fools that ordered well done.  It also seemed like the steak had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on the temperature.  Loan seemed stunned by this as was I.  I've had plenty of ribeyes and this was the first time I've ever sent one back.  I've only thought about doing it one other time (N9NE) but didn't pull the trigger.  I would've sent back my wife's filet had I ordered that as well.  

I got the porterhouse instead which was MILES AND MILES better.  It was juicy and beefy where it was supposed to be and the temperature was to my satisfaction.  That was 3.5 stars.  

So in the end, I would still come back here for the Italian fare, Caesar salad, ambiance and service but you might want to stick with Vic and Anthony's a couple of casinos over if you're looking for great steak.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,23,13,3,nuNxx1_88ybqUkKsbvzv1Q
5534281,2015-10-31,0,z45xS0Kc6GpiITwrpkRVdQ,"Located on the second floor of the D Las Vegas, Andiamos, with other locations in southern Michigan is a terrific addition to the restaurant scene on Fremont Street.  Can't actually say it's THE best as I have only eaten at a few, but if you have a chance to eat here, you won't be disappointed.

I ate here with my partner on a Thursday night (10-29-15) at 9pm and were seated in the back of the restaurant at a table for two.  We were greeted by our server Sandy who we later learned had worked at the property since the early 80s.  Through out our meal, she provided excellent service, was attentive, bubbly, knowledgeable (asked her where beef ""tips"" come from), and added a nice touch to our experience.  Thanks Sandy!

For my meal, I actually ordered a salad and an appetizer as I didn't want a filling meal at 9 in the evening.  Plus, with the nice assorted bread basket and caponata, it can quickly lead to an expanding stomach.  The Kale and Faro salad was a real winner with a white balsamic dressing and shaved Manchego cheese; I could eat this everyday. Yum!  Then for my appetizer, I ordered five jumbo shrimp which were placed atop zippy cocktail sauce with a lemon.  These were really big shrimp...probably 6-8 count.  I would definitely order these again and again.  My partner ordered the beef tips with zip sauce; so amazing and a terrific value option($22) if you want to try their beef without spending $50-60 for a steak. Then decided on the wedge salad which he said was really tasty.

Passed on the dessert cart, but noted they had a really great selection of sweet finishes.

I also appreciate that there is additional seating at their small bar at the front of the restaurant; nice option if you are flying solo. Plus, it's a cozy spot to just sit down and relax with a nice glass of wine. Ahhhh...

I look forward to coming back to Andiamos!",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,4,5,5,wxI8PwB38op8RvK6k_q2pQ

But for the prices on the menu, I had expected a far higher standard of quality for food and service. (Btw, this place is located in some hotel called the D which secretes an aroma of old casino smell that is both nostalgic and musty in a bad way...)

FOOD:
Boyfriend and I ordered the Brick Chicken ($32.00), Side Meatballs ($9.00), and Bone-In NY Steak ($43.00~), they also extra charged us an Antipasti Meatball ($11.00) which were bigger versions of the side meatballs. The Brick Chicken while doused in a very flavorful olive oil sauce was overcooked and very dry. Only saving grace to the dish was the portion was big and the vegetables and fingerling potatoes that came with it were very well cooked. The Antipasti Meatballs (Also comes as smaller portion side meatballs) were subpar at best, the texture was weird and grainy, the flavor of meat and marinara sauce were also bland. The side meatballs were tiny (a little bit bigger than dollar coins) and only comes with 2 for $9.00. As for the NY steak, it was charred beyond belief that it just tasted burnt, plus it came with literally just a slab of meat on a plate, no garnish or even some greens to complement the meat.

SERVICE:
All our waiters were very kind and friendly, and were super accommodating to us and our friends I really do appreciate them for their hard work. But for the amount of money we were patronizing to this restaurant, not to mention they prided themselves as a high class restaurant I would expect them to remember to input all our orders. My appetizer of side meatballs didn't come out till we were basically done with our entree, 2 hours later-- they were forgotten earlier. Then there was a miscommunication when we asked where our side meatballs were, one of the waiters had mistakened it for Antipasti meatball and charged us for another dish.

ATMOSPHERE:
It's pretty cozy place with dim lighting and servers in nice, clean white suits serving you. But upon closer inspection some areas seemed like it wasn't well kept. Some of our folded napkins were ripped and tattered when opened, the large curtains cascading down the ceiling were heavy and cumbersome, and it seemed almost dusty as well.

I personally wouldn't come back as I've been to plenty of other high end steakhouses on The Strip that has better professional service, with cleaner and newer facilities/decor, better quality of food for the kind of prices they're charging at Andiamo. :/",6nvUppVogRTTwZCgaYCPjw,4,2,2,lD3ex-dkRdlDMWxBqeY2FQ

The service by our waiter and his supporting cast members was top notch.  Refills frequent, unobtrusive plate clearing and prompt bill delivery all made the experience above average on the service front.

The food.  Meh.  Not even on par with the chain steakhouses.  We had a party of seven and were seated promptly at the time of our reservation.  Two of us started with the Caesar salad, to be prepared table side.  We were in an alcove, with a very large party just outside, so our waiter explained, when delivering the salads, that the table side preparation wasn't possible due to the space constraints.  Salad was huge romaine leaves, sharp, pungent shreds of Parmesan cheese and a very bland dressing, devoid of any identifiable flavors.

Two in our party ordered the roast chcken, which was served in a red wine sage sauce, which they reported to be delish.  The chicken, however, was overcooked, dry and flavorless.  Disappointment for both.

Hubby just got the oysters on the half-shell appetizer as he wasn't that hungry.  Said they were ok; however, later that night he appeared to have gotten food poisoning and was ill the next 24 hours.  Not sure where it came from, but this is a possibility.

Two in our party ordered the filet mignon, with zip sauce.  No idea what is in the zip sauce but it added nothing to the flavor.  For $39 it was not something that was amazing enough to order again.  

I opted for the chopped steak, with zip sauce.  I normally don't expect a huge ""meat eating steak experience"" when ordering this entree, and that's what I got.  There was pieces of gristle ground into the patty, and once I encountered two or three, I was done....grossed out and done!

Can't remember what the last person ordered, but again, it was unremarkable.

As we were with several guests we had never met, I was not comfortable sharing our disappointment with the manager as we left.  I intended to email my concerns upon my return; however, I cannot locate a contact email address for this establishment.

Tipping in England is very low and over 10% by their standard is generous. I have no problem with Carl bringing this to our attention but it could have been done in a much less confrontational manner. Perhaps he could have asked the person who actually paid the tab to speak in private.

The gnocchi with meat sauce was really good as well.  The gnocchis were perfectly cooked.  If you don't get anything else - get the scallops.  Holy crap were they amazing!

I can't say enough how on point our server Miguel was throughout the evening (and how often he made us laugh). He also threw together an incredible Caesar salad, made table side. You heard me right. Forget about table side guac! Once you try this you'll be sold.

Beyond the salad is a menu filled with excellent Italian cuisine and some superb steaks. Half of my family went pasta while the other half chose the cow. I was a pasta man and my choice was ""Paglia e Fieno"" which took egg and spinach linguine and and threw chicken, prosciutto, peas and a white wine cream sauce on top of it. Lovely tender chicken pieces and enough of a balance of flavors that the dish never felt too rich. Mom dined on pasta as well choosing one that included beef tenderloin tips (really tasty) while my sis got a petite filet mignon that cut like butter. Our father rocked the house with a mini (it didn't look mini!) tomahawk steak that was cooked beautifully and was accompanied by some delicious house made gnocchi. We barely spoke while we ate unless we were raving about each dish.

Two other little edible items I don't want to forget to mention, as they make Joe Vicari's stand out even more than it already does. First, the ""compliments of the chef"" capellini in a light tomato cream sauce that is given to all who order a steak. And second, the bread. Okay, the bread was great but it was more the spreading (sorry, I forgot the proper Italian name for it) that comes on the side. Let's just say once you try it, you'll scoff at butter and oil the next time you go out to an Italian restaurant. Oh, and the tiramisu! Once I saw the size of the piece I had to make that happen. Creamy and dreamy and a perfect ending to the meal.

Overall, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is excellent. That's a simple statement and one which is entirely true. Maybe it won't be the cheapest meal you have in Vegas, but you could easily spend so much more on The Strip. Instead of doing that, forget Wolfgang Puck or Gordon Ramsey and take a trip to Downtown to find Joe Vicari. You won't be disappointed.",aGDtObhCNrySrrT2qpljfA,11,11,5,x7R5786lid0rckuqvGBb1Q

The booths are very high so you kind of feel like you are the only diners. Very private. Had a very nice dirty martini as we reviewed the menu. Our waiter (Wayne?) was dressed in a white tuxedo jacket and expertly whipped up our Caesar salad table side. It was very good and kind of fancy since it was served with the romaine leaves left whole. I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly. Hubby had a scallop dish that he enjoyed very much. We had coffee afterwards that was very good; rich and velvety. Idontknow why it's hard to find good coffee in Vegas. Anyway, would have given this place 5stars if it wasn't for Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak which is hard to top in my opinion.

We had the ribeye with the special sauce so perfectly cooked and the flavor, wow!!! Also had the Dover sole, that was just ok but it is a steak house.
The chopped salad worth the parmesan garlic dressing, omg was that amazing! They split our salad worth no extra charge. 
We ordered the meatball as an appetizer. Huge,  moist, tasty meatball with a good dollop of ricotta cheese basting in marinara sauce!! 
I guess the meals come with a small portion of pasta with a delicious creamy tomato based sauce. Very good! It also came with bread and a Olive, eggplant, and caper tapenade! How much good food can one have at a time.  Love this place!!!!

After reading both good & bad reviews about this place on yelp me & my husband decided to take a chance with this steakhouse. I was a little worried me being a african American girl I read a review that said this place was racist against black ppl. Absolutely Not! I got a different vibe from them. My husband is italian & although I did feel like the host at the front door who greeted us upon arrival & sat us down @ our seats was a little weird.  When she told us to enjoy our dinner she only told it to him not me, I mean literally looking him in his face, I almost felt imaginary lol. Idk maybe I was being too sensitive. Then when she sat us down she asked us if we wanted the small table sat for 2 or a bigger table set for 4. We choose the bigger table because the table for two was more for a table of 1 once you have food on it. We had to wait for the table to be cleaned off and set. We saw napkins forks & knives set on the table so my husband asked the lady if we could have a seat now, she then sarcastically said ""glasses"" as if he was dumb for not knowing that. After the table was set we had a seat & the lady apologized for the table not being ready upon our arrival. Our server was very nice & polite always checking up on us. I can't stand when your @ a resturant  & you have to look all over  for your sever. That was definitely not the case here. The food was excellent I got the brick chicken & my husband got the bone in rib eye steak. I'm usually not a steak person, like I don't even like Fogo De Chao.

I love that it's kind of secretly hidden to the upstairs and take a short hallway to the dining room. We had a 730 reservation and were planning for before dinner drinks at the bar but luckily were able to get in right away. It's pretty dark in the restaurant but it makes for that very intimate feel. 

We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and two appetizers, calamari and crab cakes. Both were fantastic and the calamari gets I believe 4 different sauces to choose to dip in. The wine was delicious as well (another bottle was ordered...which we probably didn't need but we were having a great time). For dinner I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was cooked perfectly, and on a bed of risotto! I literally ate everything on the plate! One friend got the gnocchi, and the other the bone in ribeye. They both loved their dishes, and I think my one friend and I were jealous of the friend who got the ribeye, because that steak was on point! I'll get that next time! 

Since it was my birthday dinner I got a delicious piece of tiramisu, and I saved the rest for later to which I woke up at 4 am and ate. My friend got creme brûlée, she didn't share! She ate every last bite!!! 

Last and finally the best part of our meal was our server Todd D. I haven't had a nice sit down meal where you really get taken care of and I wanted to spoil myself for my 30th birthday. He spoiled us from start to finish with the best recommendations and service. If you go to have dinner here please request him because you will be treated like royalty.

For starters we ordered the calamari and crab cakes.  Both were excellent.  They offer a free appetizer of ratatoulli (sp) and it was stupendous.  I really could have just made a meal of that with some of their delicious garlic bread...thin and crunchy.

I had the best filet mignon I have ever had.  If you get a chance to choose a steak sauce, choose their signature ""Zip"" sauce...it's so good you'd want to drink it!  

My dining companions have fabulous scallops, lobster risotto and one diner opted for tortallini.  Everyone was thrilled with their entrees. 

To end the meal we splurged on a decadent chocolate cake and cheese cake that were both excellent.

When I told my attentive waiter Miguel that I was ordering Veal Osso Bucco as my entrée, he closed his eyes, tipped his head back, and placed his hands over his heart almost in reverence at my choice.  And it really was great, rich tomatoey-flavored, fall off the bone Osso Bucco.  One of the very best I have experienced!

But even before then there were other fine moments.  Pasta Fagioli with Ditalini pasta was good but not real hot.  Calamari Fritti was golden and delicious.  Italian Sausages with very soft Banana Peppers and Potatoes bathed in a red Tomato Sauce made for a great appetizer.  Tableside tossed Ceasar Salad with fine croutons, anchovy, egg, garlic, lemon, olive oil, and Reggiano Cheese was simply excellent.  And, later, sautéed Button Mushrooms and Onions and Tuscan Roasted Potatoes also with Onions rounded out a memorable meal.  

A cartful of desserts looked quite delectable.  But, alas, there was no more room.  So, my party of four passed on these tempting selections.

Food: 
Appetizers - Bread and dipping sauce was delicious. My parents, wife, and brother all ordered the Caesar salad made table side.  Miguel took his time, let us know what he was putting in and it turned out awesome. I ordered the grande meatball and it was perfect. 
Main Dish - I ordered the Bone-In ribeye steak, medium rare. Came to the table perfectly cooked to my liking. My wife had the filet with lobster tail. The lobster was delightful and not over cooked. Filet cooked perfect. Mushrooms and Onions went along perfect. 
Dessert - We all sampled each other's desserts. My wife and I had the ricotta cheesecake and it was delightful. My brother had the creme brûlée and it was delicious. 

What we really enjoyed, besides the awesome food, was the fact that we weren't rushed. We sat there and enjoyed the ambiance and each other's company with out being pressured to hurry up and leave. Miguel was a perfect server and host. His knowledge of the menu was superb. 

We will be back in December for the George Strait concert to celebrate our anniversary and we will for sure be headed back to this place. Thank you for an awesome experience!

Scallops were good but there were only 4 on the plate...not particularly big more medium size.  The lobster risotto was the disappointment.

I made a reservation for 630pm, but I didn't really need to.  It was near empty at that time.  Later, it filled up and was bustling.  What it did assure me is seating at a booth, instead of table.  And the booth, ohhhh, had very soft leather to sit on and to feel.

The menu is large format, and 2 pages.  What I noticed is that the prices, particularly of the appetizers and wine, is very reasonable if not cheap.  I got 2 glasses of Malbec for $11 each, and they were like butter, very good.

I couldn't help myself.  Dining with a good local friend, the sky was the limit.  We ordered:

1.  The Gigantic Meatball ($9) - Perfectly cooked and in an amazing marinara, it was the equivalent to 6 or so meatballs.  Paired with the fresh, warm bread, this was an absolute winner all-the-while topped with ricotta cheese.  (4.5 stars)

2.  Asparagus ($9) - Seasoned and in Olive Oil, it was an extremely large portion -- a full stock of thin spears.  (5.0 stars)

3.  Truffle Mashed Potatoes ($8) - Wonderful, with the flavor of truffle.   How can it be bad?  (4.0 stars)

4.  Filet Mignon ($38) - Cooked medium, it was the real deal.  Served with an amazing side of pasta with vodka sauce.  (4.5 stars)

5.  Agnolotti ($22) - Handmade pasta filled with ground veal, beef and pork in wild mushroom-basil crème sauce.  It was like pierogi in a cream sauce.  Excellent.  (4.25 stars)

The service was the kind expected at a white tablecloth type of place, but Raul was a very nice and personable man who could take a joke or two, not stuffy.  While he could do a better job at memorizing the menu, he was first class all the way.

I went during my last trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my best friend's birthday. He had previously been there and had nothing but wonderful things to say (went as far as saying it was one of the best meals he had ever had, so of course we had to try it)! We had to change our reservation multiple times (our plans kept changing due to a long hike, cab problems, etc) and the hosts were nothing but accommodating and understanding! 

The service was great! We were seated soon after arriving and were promptly greeted and the service throughout the meal was just as good. 

As far as drinks go, we didn't order any bottles of wine since we were going out after - ordered vodka drinks from the bar (hard to mess up- and were strong, so we were happy).

The food was delicious! The complimentary bread/breadsticks and tapenade were flavorful and delicious! We started with the ""Andiamo Grande Meatball"" - super tender, with fresh tomato sauce and ricotta cheese - extremely delicious! We got the caesar salad - where they come with the cart and hand make it (everything! including the dressing) in front of you. It was awesome to watch and was delicious for the most part (I got a few chunks of anchovy - my friend didn't - which was unfortunate and ruined the rest of my plate for me - but still overall tasty). (My other friend got a house salad and enjoyed it)

For the entree, I ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast (stuffed with ricotta, sundries tomatoes, and spinach) with a side of onions and mushrooms. The chicken was delicious - although I wished there was more of the stuffing - and the side was just okay. Not bad, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped. The birthday boy ordered the filet with a side of asparagus and loved everything about his meal and our other friend ordered the Agnolotti pasta and enjoyed it, as well.

I let the waiter know that it was my friends birthday and they brought out a complimentary cake (rum cake? Not sure, but we could taste rum and it was absolutely delicious!!) They usually bring around a cart of desserts to choose from, which they didn't since they gave us the cake. I kind of wish they still did (I probably would have indulged in more), but it's probably a good thing they didn't! 

To end the meal, we ordered the espresso! Amazing!! It comes with a sugar rock candy on a stick that you can stir in the espresso and dissolve. Loved ending my meal with this!! 

Overall, great experience! I know my friend will be back since he lives there now, and I think it's highly likely that I will be back when I'm visiting!",cp-rWPVqlGyuroPKoBefYQ,9,2,5,VH6Qr1vf4VL7XCo9iQeuZg

Everything was perfect, my husband devoured his steak and I couldn't help but to help myself to some of his. I had eggplant and I inhaled it lol! I know this place was formerly at LVH but I never went because I knew the family of the former manager and knew they were shady people and never trusted to eat there.
With the new manager and location, this is my new favorite!",6UQlnFvSr5dUJuy0RA-M2Q,0,0,5,Bzy4S3i69dGWjIdE9cLlZg

I loved it all. The tall leather booths, waiters in white tuxedo jackets, hardwood floors, excellent service. I could dine here every day.

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi and it was divine paired with a very nice New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. My mother ordered, to date, the best rib-eye I have ever tasted. It was a party of 25 and everyone's dish looked amazing. I had a taste of the Martha Vineyard salad and the lobster macaroni. Amazing food! So worth the visit.",CScKVOGaZ-kbdJXOgt8l8A,1,0,5,pwGM2dC7pwBLeF3Zseu3CA

     We were seated in a round leather booth table and Todd was our waiter. He was awesome, we had martinis that were perfect, we ordered the tomahawk steak along with spinach, it was cooked to order and served tableside. It melted in our mouths. The dessert was a cheesecake with liquor masserated berries. Yummy doesn't describe it. I would go back for the steak and Todd again anytime. 
    If you want delicious food. Wonderful atmosphere and the. Eggs from an era gone by. This is the place. Not old stuffy. Cool vintage and the casino downstairs has dealers and go go dancers. Just wow!!!!",D224RQ9WRnWmndZJiQ-kAA,3,0,5,oMRzABbac1L9zNnYZdA3bg
