When we asked for more water for a 4 oz cup they said they ""don't do refills on water"" because ""his boss said"". I have never been denied water anywhere. That is ridiculous.",-Hpo7IB6ZeVjRDlgQ9dyOA,0,0,1,-Nx26a1yY4SMieaIm912UQ

1211654,2017-11-03,0,v8KJxkaqdahn90r7chXQZg,"Ordered the beef noodle soup with a teriyaki chicken as a side. Honestly, the taste is not bad, but it would be better if they can add more beef to it. There are only 6 - 7 tiny pieces and that is definitely not enough. The chicken is not as tender as you can get from a restaurant due to the fact that these are pre-made, but the teriyaki sauce kinda soften it a bit, so I think that is acceptable. By the way, this is not a purely Japanese food, it is more like fusioned Asian.",j0TPAWLQdJb4_tzJcpJ21A,0,0,4,ipZz1vDwmsNYsi1rBuCFSQ

Be wary, although this is ""food court food,"" Las Vegas strip pricing bumps up the dollars a little bit more. They have a la carte pricing and also two-entree plates which are the better deal, IMHO. The plates come with your choice between a side of rice, noodles or half/half. Sadly, they didn't have labels on what the food was, so I had to half guess and mostly point. Nonetheless, it wasn't too bad. Here's the breakdown:

I got the two-entree plate with noodles as my side and this chicken, mushroom, zucchini medley which had peanuts and orange chicken as my entrees. MIL got the same two-entree plate with half/half noodles & fried rice & teriyaki chicken & a Mongolian style beef (?) as her entrees.

Both agreed that the NOODLES were absolutely delicious! They honestly don't look like anything special & the veggies were huge chunks, but the flavor was so good! I also enjoyed the orange chicken & the teriyaki chicken was yummy per my mom. Have the say, though, that the noodles make the review..

Don't knock it 'til you try it! I just wish they would put labels on the food so you don't have to guess. And the sizes for their ala carte items are a little small for the prices they charge, but again it's the Strip pricing.",TS5K8k7Rs6KPxv7OUjscrQ,0,0,4,T8Jo1EcLYoBQC5Boneffsw

They started by having me wait 10 minutes for a quick noodle soup. (She forgot about order) I had to chase her down, where is my noodle soup?

The soup had no resemblance to the soup in the picture. Chewy noodles with Tiny pieces of meat. Did not finish both orders, kinda bad.

The mango grapefruit tapioca dessert was a drink thru a straw not to be eaten with a spoon. Just a so so drink with many options around us.

Don't think I will be coming Back here again.",FIYkwZ_OCj5h57wbHnuBrw,1,0,2,Y7FIhZY9FyGCbeIes3YW2w
2458873,2016-08-21,0,v8KJxkaqdahn90r7chXQZg,For a restaurant that prides itself on being fresh the meat was surprisingly cold. If you were to taste the noodles in a blind taste test you would probably assume they were skinner pasta with cabbage mixed in. By and large everything was exceptionally under-seasoned.,VGywO0GcyCg2Qtl4oO34Tg,2,0,1,dsSWAtXIgCeJTU0xviMJmQ

Some vegetables would have been great, but Udon for under $6 is not a bad deal. There's a beef soup as well.

It was served in a plastic bowl, so it turned my friend off from eating it due to her allergy, but I felt it was fine since I had no reaction to it.

The orange chicken actually isn't bad but I did not know that until I tried it. Here's where it started. I asked the little, old, asian lady if i could sample the pork and the orange chicken so I could decide. She said ""only one""... (wtf? How will i know want I want if I've never tried your food?)

Me: ""why's that? I would like to try them both""

Her: -sassy ""only one.""

Me: ""I want to try the pork""

She gives it to me but doesn't shake the grease off and it got on my shirt and jeans.... then I asked to try the orange chicken... She swayed her head with irritation and hesitated to give it to me making me reach way over the counter to accept the sample from her....

So I told her what we wanted. Although I should have just gone else where. And then at the end she gave the two of us 1 fucking napkin, spoon and fork.

1 for 2 people!!

Boyfriend : ""ummm can I have some more napkins and forks""

Her: -rolls eyes, hesitates and sighs"" and gives him some more napkins. 

I don't understand what the hell her deal is or why she is so stingy but that was really rude and upset me. 1 fucking napkin???? 1 fucking sample!?? Smh.

Do you want a sale or not?

As for the food, it's actually not bad. More real tasting than panda.",A85dXZi_XC-tOx9z405ZqQ,0,0,2,jjl_7Hx_Mm9mMfpph7iq8Q
