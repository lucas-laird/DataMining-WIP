The workers are so friendly and welcoming, it felt like I was back in K-town in NYC for a minute :). I asked our waitress a few questions about the menu, and then I saw that they have jjambbong (my absolute favorite). She explained to me that it's different here (not our traditional jjambbong, but similar.. and with udon noodles!). Of course I was intrigued. I ordered it my usual style (as spicy as possible with extra noodles). 

When it came out, it looked and smelled incredible but I knew right away that it will not be anything like jjambbong. There were lot of crabs in it, which you never really find in a traditional bowl of jjambbong but I was more than happy to see them! They were fantastic! There wasn't enough noodles for sure... because I asked for extra noodles, and it did not come even close to cutting the cake. I can't imagine what the bowl is like without the extra noodles..... probably just soup? Anyhow, this dish is a great choice if you like spicy seafood. I will definitely be ordering it again!

I want to return to this place to try other food items but I know it will be hard not to order the same dish I tried :).",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,1,1,4,Pxyos60NIhKxgriMdowi0w

Needless to say, I immediately swerved across a lane of traffic and pulled a uey. We pull up, and yes, there was the almost too good to be true sign: 

ALL YOU CAN EAT BIBIMBAP $8.79

The review could pretty much end there, right? I mean this is a genius creation, but I will share a little more.

2010 Fusion used to be Won Mi. We had pulled up there once before and left because we didn't get a tasty eats vibe. Then, they changed their name to 2010 Fusion Restaurant, and that pretty much eliminated any chance that we would be eating there. The name gives you no idea of what type of food to expect, but at the same time it kinda makes you think you probably won't like whatever they're fusing.

However, have no fear! The restaurant should be called Umma's because it feels like you're hanging out in a Korean mom's living room. The ladies who greeted us were friendly, funny and casual in a way that made me feel like a regular, even though it was our first time. The AYCE BBB is basically a giant salad bar of banchan, aka Misti's nirvana. You get a bowl, throw in some rice, throw on all the veggies you want, take the bowl back to your table and mix it all up with the sauce. Then, you can repeat. The veggies included all the usual suspects: radish, cucumber, spinach, other green things, bean sprouts, mushrooms. 

Plus, it comes with soup! There was a kimchi soup and my all time favorite -- radish beef soup. I did not try the kimchi soup. The radish soup verged on being too spicy, not really in a hot way, but I still found great pleasure in slurping it up. Given that I adore this soup whenever I find it, I was pretty ecstatic. And of course, I chugged several glasses of barley tea. If you have not had barley tea, take yourself to a Korean restaurant pronto. 

My husband was a bit disappointed that they didn't have a way to serve dolsot (the hot stone pot which sizzles up the rice), but I think that is a minor shortcoming. It also took us about 15 minutes to pay because their credit card program crashed, and during this time, we witnessed a frustrated Korean woman cursing like a sailor. So, I may still be on a high from having discovered pretty much what I have always dreamed of -- a place where I can enjoy bottomless banchan and radish soup without having to order BBQ -- and accordingly, I will limit myself to 4-stars. However, there should definitely be more peeps giving this lunchtime bibimbap buffet a whirl!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,13,4,msdtA4frWhZVoJJ-BZi5lQ
