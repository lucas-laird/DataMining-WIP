I am currently placing an order for a staff luncheon, and expecting the same great quality and price.",5imUkwVOxS2XW1y_h5NMaQ,0,0,4,uQoJcMSm1E509lOPPjgDfg
381767,2011-11-25,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,I decided to check out Mama MIa's Pizzeria today after a afternoon at the park with my daughters and I can tell you it is my neighborhood new go to pizza joint!  The pizza was not on the fly and the staff was nice and the place was super clean.  The pizza was piping hot when it got to the table and considering I paid a little over $6 bucks for a 10 inch with a drink included I think thats a steal for lunch.  Try it out you will not be disappoint =).,99Qe7y7GCi9kjTCO7kFlMQ,2,1,5,QeywB520xfVuRtK7kiV-qQ

The pepperoni is cut in large rounds and is a good quality pepperoni.  The crust is so good I could eat that all by itself.  Lots of cheese and that's what I want.  

The owners are very friendly and it's a pleasure to stop in to pick up an order.",JeP9dFFGsfLZKnUmXWx9NA,0,0,5,UcpjWLumvkkaZF_v12ltug

New owner laugh at old owers woes and I am sure have never been in this business before.  My food was void of seasoning and if there was cheese on it I did not notice.  The menu is new and very expensive.  We'
 are very sorry that we will not go again, as Mama WAS a great local place.  I suggest you find some where new.",kc9ngTjNnDC4FZVQAYz4rw,3,0,1,iQdofoH4zQDxAisU26i27Q
1376300,2012-06-16,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"Good pizza for a great price. You can't go wrong with the pick up special, they charge $7.50 with tax for a large pie and you pick a topping. Like another reviewer said no need for extra cheese they aren't cheap with it. Just make sure to call 25 minutes in advance so they have it fresh out of the oven for you. This place isn't fancy but the food and service have always made me happy.",RY-3NLrwyZoleRQUfnoHsw,1,1,3,03KJdDqdGrXdLqhVhsY2zw

The chef actually came over to us and started to explain how he makes everything by hand and the more he went on the hungrier we became. The chef wasn't all talk. The Food was Delicious!! Even the Salad. We ordered 2 pizzas, buffalo wings and Spaghetti. Like I said, it was Delicious!! The service was excellent. The chef came over and took a picture of us and after we ate, he gave us some Cupcakes that he made, for free. The kids loved that part. We would definitely recommend this place. It's very reasonable for a big family like ours.",UzvNUbw6A-aqAfSP6AP5_w,2,1,5,_wV4xgnIDfy3UwvDVjpccg

1976618,2014-05-20,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"This place seems to be under new ownership with the same name- I never would have known if I hadn't commented on their cute pizza clock over the kitchen door, and was told it came with the place when they took over 2 months ago.

Service was friendly. Ordered a large house salad with Italian and a slice of pepperoni to go. Salad was large, but underwhelming- should have opted for a specialty salad, as the mix of iceberg lettuce and peppers with a mostly-straight-olive-oil Italian dressing just didn't really do it for me. It's well-priced for a large portion at $5, and may be much better simply with a different dressing.

Was pleasantly surprised by the pizza- was expecting the kind of by-the-slice stuff that has likely sat out, but my piece was fresh, cheesy, and featured giant pepperonis. The crust was also well-seasoned with a garlicky blend that I really enjoyed, and the sauce was a very savory chunky tomato version that was heartier than what I usually find on pizza. It was quite greasy though, and required using multiple napkins as I ate, making me feel a bit sick toward the end- but it was so tasty!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,3,73rAxbvyR62bPVbi0lEbhg

We have ordered twice from them and both time it has been extra ordinary.  I work close and will be ordering pizza for my whole office to try.",jhZRzRI03McAU4N2z2x6xg,0,0,5,VlVSXICR6-xgAvl0ILyqdg
3141380,2014-07-18,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"So this place always has a sign outside saying they have a ""carry-out"" special of an XL 1 topping pizza so i decided to go ahead and try it out i mean for $7 who wouldn't. Well here is what a good example of ""You get what you pay for"" comes into play. The pizza was first of all way too much tomatoe sauce and then the dough was soggy. When i picked up the first slice of pizza right before i tried to bite it, all the toppings slid right off.. Epic FAIL to say the least lol i couldn't do anything but laugh! Sheesh if i would have just not been lazy and drove the extra half of a mile to pizza hut i could've paid $3 more for a real pizza. Not sure if i'd ever eat here again.. well maybe i would under one conditions.. The toppings stayed in place :-)",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,0,0,4,1UPr4dSPU0ZaS8ceKj9grQ

The prices were more than fair, and the place was really clean. The pizza wasn't out of this world, but it was still good. I would drive across town for this place.

4114314,2014-06-30,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"The store has been sold a couple of times in the past couple years and the new owners seem to have a clue  about good pizza and food prep. If you used to come here and stopped, give them another shot. Previous owner made terrible pizza, but the pie now is back to something you'd come back for. Store usually manned by Doug (owners son) & Mandy, they run a nice, clean place with tasty pizza, wings and chicken. That's all we've ordered so far, but we will again be using Mama Mia as our fave local pizza joint so I'm sure we will get to know the menu a lot better soon.",2E4NBQv6G8UhQfhlMNAg1g,0,0,4,_4Bh0EUq4LQgwFUtuaQa-w
4169980,2014-01-13,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"This may be a moot point, because this place may be closed by the time you read this. We ordered the 11 dollar day pizza, which still features good sliced sausage and has decent cheese and sauce, but the dough now tastes like nothing. But enough with the praise, my wife found the lasagna to feature about 4 sheet noodles sitting in marinara sauce with some meat sauce tucked in between and covered in cheese sitting in a tin tray. But that is not why I am writing this review, My chicken parmesan sandwich was inedible. It featured a breaded piece of chicken jerky that was microwaved to translucence. I called to let them know they had lost a customer, and they said ""Okay,"" with resignation. Please allow these individuals to find work that fills their life with meaning by never trying to eat rubber chicken like I did.",jP6DSjkBCn5GGwGF2SRS8Q,0,0,1,30SNOBQ0yrdnHG36Lf6CYg
4234520,2010-06-01,1,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"We ordered here last Friday night. I was told it would be a hour wait for delivery, so we went and picked it up since I had a hungry husband and 4 year old.  When we pulled it it looks like some crummy hole in the wall pizza place.  There was 4 or so young people outside, so I go in and tell the boy at the counter I'm here for a pick up and my name, he says nothing goes to the back and gets my order. Why he is getting my order one from outside walked in, he is a worker in a dirty workshirt with a pair of tacky overly sized pair of basketball shorts on. In the sitting area they have a huge loveseat that is broke down needs to be taken to the dump with it's caved in seating and filthy cloth. I ordered a large BBQ chicken pizza and lasanga. The pizza looks as if someone took chunks of cheese over the pizza threw a few peices of chicken and some onions on the pizza with barely any sauce, when you take the cheese off it looks as if a paintbrush ran a light coating of sauce that you can literaly see threw.  The lasanga comes in a big take out aluminum pan, the while peice of lasagna was about the length of a fork and the width of 2 fork heads. It took up less then a quarter of the pan. The lasanga was so bland with no taste and covered it a sauce that tasted like it just came out of a can. The meatballs was ok. The best thing about the whole meal was the little tiny salad that came with the lasanga.  On the flyer we got from the hotel says they are authentic. There is nothing authentic about this place. It also states they hav 10 years experience. Cooking at home for your family doesn't count. 

If you want some real Italian food DON'T go here.  

They also spam your hotels and more then likely other places with flyers. I get at least 2 a week from these people on my door.  Spend the money on real advertising.",dp1M8w1HMAlijxdBjl1Q0Q,6,0,1,6P_ISAcvNbIOfqcFMMbHZQ
4656899,2014-04-02,0,b6LH0R-f6cmPT0dOzqkQUg,"This place has some pretty good food. Though the first few time I went it was almost a 30 min wait for 2 slices of cheese pizza. I've experience faster delivery. Seriously. Who delivers fast than that pick up experience? This very pizza joint, Mama Mia. I ordered from them yesterday and they got the same lunch special to me within the 20 mins that they said they would do. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. Were they busy the days I picked up the lunch special? No they were not. Only one customer ahead of me that did not receive a large order to explain the delay nor did they receive even a phone call. There was a time they had no customers in the store ahead of me and got one or two calls after I was there. They appear to have been tied up with cleaning and prepping more than actually fulfilling orders. 

Today I went to call back the co-owner about getting a website since they had brought out the previous owner and took over in the beginning of March and could really use one to boost their business. She was not available and a guy, would not to be mistaken as a gentleman at this point, came onto the phone and had a very rude voice off bat and was very rude when giving his no for an answer. This was after explaining that I am a customer as well. Needless to say that they just lost a customer that was planing to order that lunch special and an order for my upcoming birthday party. 

In conclusion, the food is great. Love the sauce and the quality of the cheese and toppings. They are not greedy with the ingredients that they apply. However, in my case when there is bad service, quality is enough for me to return for long waits and rudeness. So you will receive great tasting food with quality ingredients, but don't count on the best service.",98T20mbVid1ndCV345vJHw,0,0,2,4wMbLNpymJcCMkggOsp7ZA
