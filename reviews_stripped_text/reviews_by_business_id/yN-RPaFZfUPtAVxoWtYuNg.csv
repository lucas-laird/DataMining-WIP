346058,2012-08-07,0,yN-RPaFZfUPtAVxoWtYuNg,"Across the land there is food being made in large, brightly colored trucks with hardly a vegetable to be seen.  This vegetarian girl wanders from truck to truck, hoping to find something to tame her hunger but she finds disappointment more often than tasty, meat-free food.  Until one day, a beacon of light shone by a bar and led her to: Sausagefest.

Ok, I may be a bit dramatic, but it's hella tough for this veg girl to get some meat-free food truck goods.  So imagine my surprise when this meat-heavy Sausagefest truck showed up at Tenaya Creek Brewery and served up not only a veg-friendly sausage- but a vegan one!  And better yet- they had two flavors!

So they may just be Field Roast vegan sausages but that is perfectly ok with me.  They are high-quality, full of flavor, and ready to take on whatever toppings you choose.  

My husband had the Tenaya Creek Special, which had a Sage Apple sausage, sauerkraut, grilled onions, and grain mustard.  The regular version of this also comes with bacon (we of course nixed) and is cooked in Tenaya Creek's Calico Brown Ale.  I'm not sure if the vegan version is cooked in beer too since I only took a small bite of his to try.  It's very good, but I've just never been a sauerkraut fan.

I got the Smokey Robinson (without bacon).  It has a spicy Chipotle sausage with barbeque sauce and grilled onions.  It's also supposed to have cheese, but I think they left it off of mine to keep it vegan which I thought was thoughtful.  Since I'm not vegan and pretty obsessed with cheese, I think next time I'll specifically ask them to leave it on.

The bread for these sandwiches is great- a nice doughy inside with a slight crust on the outside and it's perfect for holding all the ingredients of your sandwich in place.  Also, the fries are a great deal (only $1 extra) and really tasty.  I only wish they offered bigger containers for ketchup.

Don't worry, meat eaters, Sausagefest was popular with everyone I saw, so you should give them a try too.

The employees (or owners?) are friendly, the food is good, and they are veg-friendly!  Peace and harmony has finally reached the land of food trucks!

Note to vegans:  There is a $1 surcharge for vegan sausages.  Also, please check to make sure the bread is vegan before ordering (I forgot to ask).",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,3,4,t7VQ3c4ZZfCWo7mBlcAR7Q

734058,2011-10-13,1,yN-RPaFZfUPtAVxoWtYuNg,"Disclaimer: I'm rating this establishment as a food truck.  Of course it can't compare to certain establishments that offer a dine-in experience, but the food is excellent for the price (You can get a very satisfying meal for less than 10 bucks), so I'm rating it as such. Things such as schedules become really important to me so that I can adequately track down the truck and plan to go if I'm in the area on a particular day.

Review:
Sausagefest.  It's the 1:30AM phenomena that happens to a good majority of clubs on the Strip.  As a straight male, it's when all the eye candy leaves the club, and all that's left in the club are a bunch of drunk dudes that push and shove as they try to find out where all the girls are.

While not a fan of the name of the truck, it's definitely a place that has great sausages.  Oliver says that all his sausages are made by a German shop in LA and has them shipped over. (He's right, I haven't really found any exceptional fresh made sausages from the local meat shops here.) 

But wait, it's not just the sausages, it's the extra toppings that make them even more amazing.

Example: The Bollywood: Take a nice fresh chewy bun, put a sausage in it, top with ground beef curry and raita.  Yeah, it looks like it could kill you, but it gives your tastebuds life.  I assure you that even though it looks like a chilidog gone wrong, it tastes much better than a chilidog.

Other sandwiches I've tried are the Bahn Min (really good, one of their signature dishes), and the Italian job (also good.)

Fries are pretty good too.  They're the skin-on type fries.

Does the food keep well if it's take-out?  It does reasonably well for trips less than 10 minutes (actually tested).  Fries, not so good (but they're pretty hard to keep in prime condition, no matter who's serving them).  They come in Styrofoam boxes if you order it to go.

My only real gripe about this truck is that scheduling is a bit haphazard.  You basically find out about where it's going to be probably 2-3 hours before they're there (if you're lucky you get overnight notice).  Not ideal for planning. (-1 star here.  If they correct, they can earn it back!!!)",zAqfO6-rw1Bjsxu1zmXspQ,3,0,4,xCoxXfBWNFXD4kmrO0Jwug

My husband had the Smokey Robinson, which is a hot link with bacon, cheese, and BBQ sauce. A little too much sauce, but that was one tasty sausage. I wasn't as impressed with my bahn mi sausage. The longanisa was fine, but there wasn't enough of the toppings (cucumber, daikon, and carrots) to give it much flavor. We both enjoyed the crunchy rolls the sausages were served in, but we didn't care for the bland, overcooked fries we ordered as a side.

I'd give this place a lower grade except service was friendly and super fast, and the prices weren't bad for a food truck ($7 per sausage). If you see the Sausagefest truck rolling your way, stick with the Smokey (or maybe the Mexicali, which looked good as well), and avoid the fries.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,3,dhmXvAbcjo9RbIyIxElAbQ

1596464,2014-03-30,0,yN-RPaFZfUPtAVxoWtYuNg,Tried ths food truck while attending Boulder City Beer Fest & was extremely disappointed in the food & service. Have tried this food truck in the past when they have been @ Khoury's beer nights & was impressed that's why I opted to give them a try again. Wishing I would have spent my money on one of he other 4 food trucks @ the beer fest. Got the Baja CA Sausage ($8) & ranch fries($2). Sausage didn't have hardly any flavor. Bun was dried up hotdog bun that when you tried to eat the sausage broke all apart & the items in the bun ended up on your hands. Ugh. Definitely could tell buns were sitting out in the open air all day instead of being in some type of air tight continer. Buns used to be actually hoggie buns. And the Baja CA Sausage used to come with 3 pieces of avacado on to now it's 1 measly little piece & if you want more the charge extra for that. Seriously? For $8 there better be @ least 2 pieces of avacado so that it @ least covers the whole sausage & you can get a piece of avacado in each bite. Seriously dissatisfied.  I've had better sausages @ the baseball park for less money that tasted better & cost less. Ranch fries were nothing special either.  They were cut so thin there really was no potato flavor what-so-ever. Just crunchy hard little fries with so much ranch seasoning on them it made you need another beer. Seeing from other posts it seems they change their prices depending on venue & if there's competition from other food trucks. Seems a little shabby to me. Won't be trying them again. Will give my hard earned money to a different food truck.,uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,0,0,1,qw8r6duBCJG7M74U5fLY_Q

The fries are great! They are cooked like Belgian fries. I like them plain. I saw other people eating chorizo fries and it looked like too much stuff to have with a sausage too. But roll how you want.

The longanisa bahn mi is so spicy. I was expecting sweet, sugary longanisa. It's not the actual sausage that is deadly hot though. It's the jalapeño slices and sriracha. I feel like it was almost too spicy, but I'm weak when it comes to these things.

The polish was pretty good. I only had a couple bites. It wasn't obnoxious with spice or other flavor.

& OK, I'll just come out and say it...I Love Sausage. There...now that that's out of the way.

I caught the truck a while back for the first time during lunch hours just as they were setting up. As far as the truck goes...well, it's a food truck. Not much going on. They hit up the StrEATs parking lot across from El Cortez during lunch hours some days. It's right next to my building which is super convenient for me.

These guys really serve up a quality product. The sausage as previously mentioned is huge. This thing can only be adequately handled by a french bagguette bun.
I opted for the Polish with grilled onions, kraut, and a little fresh onion on top with a good spicy brown mustard and some hot sauce.
Wow. Great black & red pepper flavor to it without being too spicy. Very filling. I don't think I would ever need a combo meal there. Just the sandwich is good for me.
I did get the combo the first time, not knowing how big this John Holmes inspired meal was going to be.
As I recall it came with some fries and some sort of mayo based side. Mac salad probably like most of the trucks do. (Are they co-op buying that stuff?)

The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is that it's a little bit pricey considering I don't want the combo really. I just want the sausage. I think I remember paying $8 for the combo & I wasn't even that hungry at the time.
If you want the fries it's probably right up your alley, but when I'm getting something like this i just want to carry & eat on the go. I don't want the styro container to contend with. I'm gonna hit it up again and see if I can get just the sausage.

the Baja Chicken. Chicken sausage topped with chipotle sauce and avocado.

2732725,2011-09-01,2,yN-RPaFZfUPtAVxoWtYuNg,"Another new food truck on the Vegas scene, this place has some serious potential. I tried them on my lunch break at work, bearing the 105+ degrees, and found the food to be pretty surprising.

Oliver, the presumptive owner, is just your regular American Filipino dude that sounds like a passionate Colin Powell when you talk to him about sausages. He believes in his truck and the food it puts out, and he's got good reason to.  The food is really, really freaking good. 

When I went, they had the Bollywood Dog. I can't quite remember what's in it other than it was a bratwurst of some kind topped with a thick raita and some kind of masala paste or thick sauce. It was unbelievably delicious! The only problem is that i went back to work smelling like masala, and I had to run around looking for mints before I could talk to clients again.

The other special they had was a Banh mi with sausage in it. Again, I don't quite remember what was in it, other than normal Banh mi stuff, but it was also really tasty. The veggies were fresh, and the sausage was tasty, but not in comparison to the Bollywood dog. 

Overall I'd give it another go, the only thing holding me back being that I think their price point is too high. The Bollywood dog came with fries and totaled to $7, which isn't terribly high but high enough to make me wince a tiny bit.

Actually, speaking of Cruisin the Sausagefest, that is exactly what this is, a Food truck, named Sausagefest, cruisin downtown, looking for wiener eaters!  

It is only about a month in business, and when I saw it, it was parked right in front of the wiener cart on Fremont street. I don't think Fabian of the Cheffini's cart liked that. 

In the Sauagefest, Oliver runs the truck, and had his cook heat up the wieners for you. They serve eclectic Asian fusion type dogs, pretty good flavors to mix with that round steak to stuff in your mouth. Like Curry flavored, Italian, Langunisa Banh Mi, or other eclectic ethnic flaves, sauces and ingredients.  

It was pretty darn good. And like most late night food trucks, they get a lot of good reviews, people love them. Why? Because reviewers are usually drunk out of their minds and anything tastes great!

I don't recall what I had, but I just remember that it was underwhelming. After the Ugly Sweater Run, I was hungry and still had my beer in hand so I figured I should get something to eat. After reviewing their menu, I was intrigued to give it another whirl.

I went with the Mexicali ($7) which has a bacon wrapped beef hot dog, chorizo, cheese, tomato, onion, mayo, and mustard. It's served with fresh cut fries. Really good flavor and completely satisfying. I also tried their special, Pulled Pork Fries ($6), made with 12-hour smoked pork, cheese, BBQ sauce, sriracha aioli, cilantro, and onions. Good stuff! I love all the flavors in both selections. 

The dog is pretty pricey, but I'd much rather have this type of food at festivals, etc than stadium food! The guys were also really friendly and helpful with selections. It's a worthwhile choice for a food truck!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,2,4,4,ylZSgBMkl_CvZQruWSuVrA

SITREP

Haha!  And obviously I'm referring to the products of the Sausagefest Food Truck (I hope!).  Meeting some local Yelpers the night before at Yelp's Fremont Street Experience, I had a hankering to go back the next night to Fremont Street and take in more of the local sights since I pretty much stayed put the night before where our Yelp party was.  And boy am I glad I went out the next night.

SETUP

Like most Food Trucks, they employ at best a very random schedule that takes them all over Las Vegas (to maximize their coverage - and possibly avoid violating local ordiances requiring a food truck to not stay in one location for more than 60-90 minutes.

As luck would have it, the Sausagefest Food Truck was making the rounds and I was able to catch it, and grab a great sausage with grilled onions and peppers.  Along with some fries we were looking at only $9.  Well worth it just to have something different and not associated with a Casino buffet for a change.

PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION

The vendor told me that they actually get their links from L.A. and they are delivered to them.  I can believe that since their spiciness rating from my tastebuds puts them on par with some of the best links I've had in L.A. when hitting the clubs their in Hollywood.

I wasn't too crazy about the soggy fries, but that is just one thing mediocre amongst so many things done right.  A solid 4-Star experience.

THE LOWDOWN

Holy crap are they kidding me? All sandwiches were $10? Are we being held hostage here or what? I have to admit the Milwaukee Brat sandwich was pretty tasty but it was not all that large and not worth ten bucks. All drinks were $4 so for a brat and something to wash it down with was $14! If I would have gotten regular or ranch fries it would have been another $3. Yikes!

I forgot what I ordered, but it was essentially a sausage wrapped in bacon, which had a nice crispness to the dog.  This was worth a 4 star.

But we also tried the chorizo fries and it was very dry...not very fresh tasting at all.  All the oil was dried up, and it seemed like a dry topping almost...this is what brought the review down to a 3.  I don't know how you can mess up chorizo, but this wasn't the way I expected it.

I'd skip the fries and go for the other options next time around.  You would probably have a much better experience.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,0,3,Ur3oU2etvZMxWf8_woWD3g

Chicken sausage with onions and green bell peppers on a bun, but just seemed to be lacking flavor.

5915271,2015-12-02,2,yN-RPaFZfUPtAVxoWtYuNg,"This review is a tale of two sausages.

I have frequented the food truck on several occasions at various events like the Las Vegas foodie fest, food truck gatherings (namely at Lees liquor events), UNLV and lastly SEMA. Each occasion has been a 4* event up until this last experience. 

I have always been a fan of the their menu with the longinisa banh mi being my default and favorite whenever we visit.
We spotted the food truck on our way from leaving SEMA to the monorail and decided to take a detour and grab a bite to eat before we left. Being that they were parked inside the convention center for a major event, I expected to be priced gouged. 
For around $20 I got a longinisa banh mi, bacon cheddar fries and a bottles drink. 
The food we got was not the standard that we were used to from these guys. 
The fries barely filled the tray and was topped with lukewarm cheese sauce and burned bacon crumbles. The sausage was equally empty and disappointing as there  was barely any slaw or sauce on the sausage at all. It looked like they were rationing and stretching the food to maximize output. Compound that with the astronomical prices associated with the convention center location, it left me sad and empty; just like my sandwich. They did themselves no favors getting greedy on both ends of the spectrum with the high prices and the substandard misrepresentation of their food. 
I hope that this is an anomaly for them and they represent themselves and their product properly going forward. It's good food when it's done right however for now I cannot put my stamp of approval on the food until we see positive changes. 

Sorry, but it's the honest truth.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,0,1,3,X34qrzx8k0iZoT-g_yCFRA
5983697,2013-04-07,0,yN-RPaFZfUPtAVxoWtYuNg,"Sausagefest made another appearance on the UNLV campus last week.

The menu had some promising choices; I had a hard time deciding what to order.  I settled on the longanisa banh mi and ranch fries. My two girlfriends got the longanisa banh mi (she broke my rule of ordering the same thing in a party!) with chorizo fries and baja chicken with fresh cut fries.

There were two registers open which helped speed along the checkout process. One sandwich and fries set me back $7; so I can't complain too much.  The food came out super quick too.

The ranch fries were super salty, and they were just okay. They were just fries tossed in hidden valley ranch powder. My friend's chorizo fries were good though. Maybe it was the slew of goodness smothering the fries (chorizo, cheese, jalapeños, etc.) but I wished I had ordered those instead.

The sandwich itself was just okay. I didn't think it was that spicy honestly.  The longanisa was overpoweringly fatty and I felt the sandwich was a tad one note.  It was missing the spicy jalapeno kick and salt from the pickled vegetables.  Although I could see garlic chili paste on the sandwich, I couldn't really taste it - and my heat tolerance isn't even that high.

Overall, it was okay. I would probably try something else off the menu if I ran into the truck again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find them.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,0,0,3,ziq9efMnuk1oLZuM0cRzOA
