A few of us arrived early and grabbed a drink at the bar - both of us had higher end whiskey at the bar - prices were fair for what we were drinking. 

We were seated and ordered appetizers and dinner - all food that everyone ordered was great - I personally had the bruschetta with mortadella, the beef short ribs and polenta - all items were fantastic. Others in my group had the lobster risotto, filet and salmon - all of us had the same though - amazing.

Overall the service was great - servers were on top of their game, knowing when we needed something, yet not intrusive. They were even willing to make something that wasn't currently on the menu for one person in our party - their answer to that seemed like it wasn't anything big at all...

Next time I'm in Vegas I would definitely consider heading back to this place...",jM9YePr12W78DZyFq-l-Sg,5,0,5,CyG16kqkLOGgMIhHmqzpsw

Appetizers were great (came out before the wine was poured) but 2 of our entrees did not come out and took 13 minutes to arrive.  Unacceptable!!! for a tab that was over 3000$ everyone was running around like crazy and there was no manager visit to the table, totally unacceptable.  I had the seabass dish and the bed of seafood was cold, didn't bother to say anything because I didn't want the re-fire to take 20min.

Let me also say that I know my way around fine dining establishments (French Laundry, Jean George), so this isn't coming from an inexperienced tourist looking for a plate of spaghetti.  The food itself was adequate at best -not what you expect from the owner of the legendary Spago and definitely not what you expect from a place that charges you $42 for two Caprese salads with mushy tomatoes and a microscopic amount of cheese. And on the note of the pitiful salads, I asked the server if there had been an error as it seemed a little over the top even for Vegas. I could have understood if he had waxed poetic about the buffalo mozzarella coming from a centuries-old farm in Campana or the like, but he simply said that I probably didn't understand that they were HEIRLOOM tomatoes and he laughed and walked away. Oh no he didn't you say? Oh yes, he did. So not only did we have merely average food in a restaurant owned by a 'renown' chef, we get insulted for asking a question? Done and done. I know this is Puck's first try at an Italian restaurant, but maybe he should stick to feeding people in airports if this is how he runs his restaurants. If you want good food in Vegas, go to Thomas Keller's Bouchon. You won't be disappointed and you won't be insulted, either.",WUgPgVvzVPxw0VMfQ8WlxQ,0,0,1,ODBsdpcSrkL9tTnCpY7WHg

Kids - my kids love this place, and any time you can find a place kids love to eat that doesn't have a drive-thru, everyone wins.

Linens aside, you can get out of here w/o breaking the bank as the pizzas are fairly priced and delicious (my wife had shrimp pizza, yum).

My wife ordered the linguine with clams, which was somewhat buttery but not bad. I ordered some pasta with mushrooms and while it was a big portion, I ate the whole thing (think I was pretty hungry).

380311,2013-02-05,7,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"One thing a lot of people don't know about me is that I'm a marathoner. No, not a MARINER. You think I can afford a boat? I'm a poor twenty-something! I said a MARATHONER. A runner! Yes, I am aware that this hobby of mine completely contradicts my semi-functional alcoholic lifestyle. I mean...how does one complete strict training regimen when you pretty much breathe alcohol instead of oxygen? The answer, of course, is by cutting out everything that is both fun and emotionally gratifying for 1/4 of a year at a time. Including alcohol. That's marathon training. It sucks. You stay at home 7 nights a week making sure you've taken in the proper ratio of carbs to proteins to fats, getting a lot of rest, and bumming people out when they ask why they haven't seen you for 10 weeks.

So I went to Vegas to run the marathon in early December. My pre-race carbo-load dinner was supposed to be at...I don't remember where we were supposed to go, but we wound up at Lupo. Our waiter was friendly, but he also tended to forget we were there for long stretches of time...like when we needed to order our food, and then again later while we were waiting for our food. I'm pretty sure for 45 minutes after we told him what we wanted to eat he just wandered aimlessly doing God knows what, and never actually placed our order.

We started with a pizza. Some idiot at the table (probably my mom) said, ""I don't know, guys, I think the mushroom and caramelized onion and fontina cheese pizza looks good."" As if pizza can BE any good without copious amounts of meat on there. That's not true. In my opinion the best slice of cheese pizza can run laps around the best pepperoni slice. Get it? That's a running joke. Because the theme of this review is running.

I ordered the Fettuccine e Funghi di Bosco (wild mushrooms, garlic, English peas, parmesan butter sauce) most likely because I didn't hear the pizza order. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten ANOTHER dish with mushrooms in it. Because I'm such a pain in the ass I asked the waiter if they could add a small grilled chicken breast to the pasta, and he was very accommodating. He even offered to use fancier chicken but I had to kill his fancy chicken dream and tell him basic chicken would do.

No matter the chicken, service was slow. We waited what felt like an eternity four our food. It got so the manager came over and said that HE was going to help expedite our order. We never complained. We were happy just to be there, my mom, my sister and I. It was like we were a family again. A hungry family being deprived of food. The server and the manager just took turns every ten minutes giving us updates. They paid such close attention to us it was as if we were Lupo royalty, only instead of star treatment we received no food.

Finally, two dishes (not mine!) were served cold. All in all it was just a bummer of a meal. Courteous but also tedious. For the price, there are no less than thirty restaurants on the strip I'd sooner return to before I try Lupo again.

I set a personal best with my marathon time the next day. Whether my dinner at Lupo had anything to do with it, I'll never know. Because how the hell does one measure the precise effect one's dinner has on an athletic performance the following day? What am I, a scientist?

It started with the hostess who told me that we would be seated in 10 minutes because they were clearing some tables so we waited. But after about 10 minutes another hostess comes up to the podium and asked another couple if they have been helped, they say no and right away they got seated. Then right after, the original hostess who told me to wait 10 minutes, told us we would be seated shortly, which we were.

But then after being seated my boyfriend and I were sitting there menu-less for at least 5 minutes until I finally made eye contact with someone who signaled to our waiter that we needed menus.

But the lag doesn't stop there, my boyfriend and I had to wait 20 minutes for someone to even take our order. And the worst part is, I had to tell another employer to call my waiter so he could take down our order. But soon after the employee told us that our waiter is too busy so he would take our order instead. I was expecting an apology but received none for the terrible service. 

To top all this off their food didn't even make up for their horrendous service. I ordered the fettuccini and my boyfriend got some chicken lemon dish and both dishes looked and tasted like dishes we could make at home. It was definitely not worth paying $60 for...

Six of us went to the 7:00 LOVE show at the Mirage (AWESOME!). Then we headed over to Mandalay.  We were fiending for something to eat and nothing we came across sounded right.  Then finally it hit me.  Italian.  That's what I needed.  So we found our way to Lupo (by Wolfgang Puck), conveniently located directly across from the Red Square, which was another place we planned to stop by during our trip. We didn't have a reservation (Friday night @ ~10:00) but were promptly seated.  It wasn't all that busy anyway.

After ordering our drinks and meals we were served a couple baskets of bread with duos of tapenade in olive oil and a white bean dip.  Very nice start to the meal.  The tapenade was delicate and salty; the bean dip smooth and creamy; the bread was pleasantly chewy with a nice crust.  The drinks finally came.  I had ordered a passion fruit cosmo.  Hit the spot.

Next came the salads and appetizer.  I ordered Prosciutto San Daniele for us, and the rest of the table got Caesars.  Smiling faces all around.  The caesar had a nice little twist no one had experienced before.  Pine nuts.  It gave just the right amount of nuttiness to the palette.

Then came dinner.  Half the table ordered Penne alla Carbonara, my friend ordered Scialatielli con Salcisse alla Bolognese, my man ordered the Lasagna Verde, and I was feeling the Funghi Pizza.  I didn't try the Penne, although they all thought it was great.  I did try the lasagna and loved that.  I also had the Bolognese and really liked the sauce.  My pizza was good, but was more doughy than I'd expected.  I was hoping for more of a Neopolitan style.  And it was enough for at least 2 people.  I only ended up eating 2 pieces out of 6.

Finally, for dessert I HAD to try the Tiramisu.  It's my absolute favorite and I get it at every Italian restaurant that offers.  Uh-muh-guh.  I think this is my new #1.  It was creamy, dreamy, melt-in-your-mouth, with just enough espresso and liquor that's not overpowering.  Die.

Bottom line: we enjoyed the food.  The only thing that was kinda lacking was the inconsistent service.  When the waitress was around she was very attentive and lovely.  But when she was gone, she was no where to be seen.  We may go back next time we're in the area (that Tiramisu is caling my name!), but there are so many other restaurants in Vegas to try it may not be for a while.",iYUxTRGK6Pk2PueIOmwpSg,0,0,4,r6tuDn6lNECyIuCqTTau-g

The only positive things I can say about this restaurant; Friendly Hostess, Nice Chairs, Cool Ceiling Lamps, and a decent lasagna. I also liked their blue-ish striped tablecloths... 

We got seated by a very sweet hostess. The hostess did her job, but the waiters screwed up big time. We sat at the table for 16 minutes (yes, 16- min sharp) before we got any attention. No menus, no drinks.
After 16 minutes the hostess was wondering what was going on, and pushed a waiter our way. Yes, we should have left...The manager walked by twice, but was to blind to notice a table of 6 with no menus.
Finally got out menus. One menu short, so we shared (not a big deal, but at a wannabe fancy and overpriced place like this  you'd expect them to at least provide enough menus). 
Just for the above, they should have been extremely apologetic, but it seemed like they didn't even realize how gone they were.
Considering this ain't Olive Garden, I would have expected the manager to at least come and apologize for the delayed service... 

The food ; SUPER OVERPRICED for the quality you're getting. My judgment might be clouded because of the horrible service that ruined the mood of our Goodbye Dinner, but I still stand for everything I M writing below- and non of us were impressed by the food.

I tried a little bit of everything. The pizza was tasteless, the bruschetta was soft (supposed to be crispy), the angel hair bolognes came out way to acidic. The lasagna was the only thing that was tasty, except for the tomato sauce. I'd say you're almost better off bringing your own pasta to In'N'Out Burger and ask if they can cook it for you.
If you're good with mediocre Italian-Fusion food, then order to go.  Don't bother sitting down. The service is slower and has less personality than a plastic chair from 1999 at your local DMV.
If Wolfgang himself would have gone undercover at this place, he would been so ashamed for having his name on this restaurant that he would have left the restaurant business and become a sales rep for the paper edition of the yellow pages.
I'm sorry Wolfgang. I wanted to like it, but non of us had a great experience...

There was a large group of us (20+) and we had such superb service...a very attentive staff who made it their mission to be sure every glass was full and every plate enjoyed.  Our table had a wonderful antipasti, calamari rings and caprese salad as appetizers and enjoyed every bite.  The pre-dinner breadsticks are traditional Italian-style...long, thin and crunchy as they should be...a half-dozen wrapped in a cloth napkin, perfect for breaking off and nibbling as we chatted over the appetizers.

I had the bucatoni with prosciutto and pecorino cheese; the waiter said the dish was on the spicy side and that the pasta was prepared al dente (as it should be); it was delightful.  A friend at the table avoids meat so asked for a simple pasta marinara which was served without hesitation; she loved the flavor of the sauce.  Another friend had the Lasagna-Gramma-style which was also very tasty ( i tried a bite)...delicious bolognese layered with cheeses and roasted green peppers instead of the pasta...she tries to avoid gluten, so this was an unexpected treat and quite delicious; I will definitely try to replicate this dish at home...wonderful!  

After cosmos before dinner, 2 bottles of wine with dinner and lots of water, we passed on the cappucinos and tiramisu...but i would wager they were as wonderful as everything else we enjoyed.

I was VERY disappointed with both the service and quality of food. Not only did it take about 12 minutes for waiter to acknowledge our table and then he told us the salads available but never offered us drinks, it then took 15 minutes for my aunt to get her iced tea after ordering it from the very unenthusiastic waiter, and we only got it after I went to host stand and asked hostess and manager where her iced tea was. We had salads to start, and while the Caesar was actually really good, we were never offered fresh ground pepper and even after we asked for it, no one brought us any and we paid 13 bucks for our side salad. The meal came, I had to send my sea bass back. The piece was incredibly thin and overcooked :( Waiter finally acknowledged his terrible service and brought us a free desert which was a wonderful chocolate raspberry torte (the reason this is 2 stars and not 1 actually.) The manager never came over to offer any apologies even after we had to ask where our iced tea was, no pepper, food sent back and waiter ""took care of"" a desert for us. I will NEVER go back, and I am a huge foodie and often return to great restaurants. When spending 160 bucks on a meal (with no alcohal, just food for 3) I expect MUCH better service!

Fettuccine Verde con Funghi di Bosco, Piseli, Prezzemolo e Parmigiano Reggiano
Scialatielli ""Ai Quattro Passi"" con Salsicce alla Bolognese, Basilico e Lamelle di Parmigiano

Everything is compared to my great-grandmother's cooking, and very few italian restaurants in my hometown have made the cut.  I am pleased to announce that Lupo has definitely made the cut in my book!

My guy and I opted to sit at a table on the ""patio"" section of the restaurant which is actually in the hallway of Mandalay Bay.  Some may not enjoy sitting in this section, but I love people watching and the excitement of being a part of the action of the hotel.  Also, no fear of your napkin flying away because you're not actually outside!  We ordered drinks and were quickly given a delicious (and quite large) loaf of fresh, warm bread along with an olive tapenade and a delicious and subtle dip made from leeks.  I found that mixing the two dips on your piece of bread was the best way to indulge!

There are a variety of options on the menu, including several pasta and pizza dishes that are reasonably priced for such a fancy restaurant.  I decided on the bucatini al' amatriciana.  When it arrived, I was amazed at how large a portion I was given.  Usually you hear stories about fancy restaurants providing tiny portions not worth the money, that is definitely not the case here!  My dish consisted of bucatini noodles (a very thick noodle with a small hole through the center), pancetta, a light tomato sauce, onions and pecorino.  This combination of ingredients was simple, but very delicious.  The pancetta made the whole dish have a great smokey flavor.

There was 1 screw up- no one seemed to know we were there once we were seated. We finally flagged a server down after about 15 min of no menus and people strolling past us. Once our server seemed to notice us, however, things went well. 

Cocktails were refreshing and not too strong. 

Grilled octopus appetizer was delicious with just enough sauce, not too overpowering. 

We had the fish and chicken mains which were satisfying and tasty. 

Apple tart with vanilla ice cream for dessert had just the right amount of marzipan for sweet and tart. Flaky buttery crust. A perfect way to end the meal. 

All this and a glass of wine for about $200. More than worth it and a good deal for a big name vegas restaurant meal.

Caprese was also good and the prosciutto was acceptable.

979313,2012-08-03,0,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"I just attended a $90 special prix-fixe dinner party at this dreadful restaurant. It was one of the worst meals I've ever had. It cost us $90 a head for just an appetizer, salad and main course -- no dessert or beverage of any sort. Maybe that would've been ok if the food was delicious but it wasn't special. And the entree was horrible. On top of that, service was slow. We were seated by 8:30 p.m. and couldn't wait to pay our bill and leave by 10:30 p.m.

The meal started with an antipasto appetizer sampling that gave us each one little meatball, a small slice of pizza, and a slice of bruschetta (chopped tomatoes on a small slice of Italian bread). 

From there, we proceeded to the cesar-ish salad, which was acceptably dressed but not amazing. Plus, the croutons were little rocks. 

As for the entree, we had a choice between chicken or a pork chop. The pork  chop sounded like a better value dollar-wise but it ended up being a huge chunk of meat with just a dot of veggie puree spooned into the center of the plate. No one sitting around me finished their main course. I didn't either.  

I'm here attending a convention and am sorely disappointed because the fancy food in Vegas is supposed to be good. If you're at the Manadalay Bay, there are plenty of other brand name restaurants here to try. Skip Lupo. If you're on a budget, there's an all-you-can eat buffet place that costs about 30 bucks, which is probably a good option for a group of people who might have various eating issues. 

Personally, I've had two meals at one of the lower priced restaurants, Red White and Blue, where a hamburger will still set you back $15 to $18 -- but the food and service are good. Check out my review for that place!",Dtdy_XdJHuMcGb1GaTBGrw,0,0,1,8Q5kf6OSVmlDEQwAStqAsg

1025195,2015-07-02,1,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"Dinner on 06.30.2015

So here's the odd thing...I'm giving this place 5 stars and they completely messed up my dinner reso's and were not prepared.  But keep reading and you'll find out why.

For starters, I only decided to eat here because I had a MyVegas reward for a BOGO chef's tasting dinner (retail value $150).  Meaning a friend and I could experience the three course tasting menu for $150 total instead of $150 each.  Not a bad deal right?  Right.  So i called and made the reso and asked if we could add a wine paring to our meal for an additional $150.  No problem said the person taking the reservation and I thought cool, we're set.

Showed up on time this time =), and low and behold they had no clue about the chef's tasting menu and to add insult to injury our server Miguel informed us that the manager told him there was no wine pairing option available.  Hmmmm...something is not right here.

[Now before I go on, take into context my review about SLS customer service.  And take into account the fact that I'd had an amazing meal at Mizumi the night before.  Ok...let's proceed.]

I would have been fine with the fact that they had no clue except for the fact that I had CALLED A FEW HOURS EARLIER to confirm we had the wine pairing with the meal.  Confirm.  They confirmed LoL. 

Anyway when I let the server know what our original plans had been two things happened right away.  He began to panic slowly, something I wasn't quite expecting and then he did what he could to resolve the issue.  If I were a notable guest, maybe a celeb or someone with status in the city I'd probably expect this kind of treatment.  But no.  I'm not those things and the fact that he and the rest of the wait staff tried and never EVER made me or my guest feel like we were putting them out or what not spoke volumes to me.  They could have been rude about it, they could have seemed like it was now a chore to do the tasting menu but they didn't.  At one point my friend laughed and said it seemed like every server in that restaurant knew what happened because they all kept coming by to check on us and ensure we had everything we needed at that point.

GREAT GREAT GREAT customer service.  

Another cool thing was during one of the five, yes five not three, courses that we had was not on the menu. Now, I'm not sure if this was a lie or not but honestly I didn't care.  All five courses were amazing and I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.

So, in summation:

Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars. Miguel...you are awesome
Manager - 0 stars (he's pretty much the only one who didn't seem to care they'd messed up the reso)
Front desk - 0 stars, come on...if I hadn't called to confirm my reso then find out it wasn't taken down was kind of frustrating
Overall - 5 stars.  I'm not letting the bad outweigh the good here and honestly this experience was worth all the hassle.",LD63ZTE4ARkNV3w-2UkGrg,0,0,5,R-vfE2dPV6Wp87NiebAs_Q

1109277,2015-07-17,0,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"There I was, looking for a place to eat; so many options. Where to go, where to go?  A business acquaintance recommended Lupo. So, Lupo is was.

First night was a bust.  Called the hotel concierge to ask about reservations; told none were needed.  Arrived to find out they were fully booked, but I could sit at the bar next to the server station.  No thanks...and what about my guest?  Lesson, when in Vegas, go ahead and get reservations!

So, here we go the second night, yes with reservations.  Lupo in many aspects is two different restaurant atmospheres serving the same menu; seating along the Mandalay Bay walkway to other restaurants and casino, and seating behind a wall giving the feeling of a more intimate atmosphere.  Initially chose the former, but was crazy busy with servers bumping into me, so asked to move to a more quiet location.  Whew, finally set to order.  The service was excellent.  The waiter was not fazed a bit by my request to move and remained completely professional.  The menu has enough items to offer variety, yet is not so overwhelming that you just don't know where to start.  I was impressed with the menu of Italian wines.

Started with the Grilled Bruschetta.  Anyone can make bruschetta, but Wolfgang Puck has done a nice job with this.  The bread had a nice crust, but was soft to the bite; it did not force me to fight with it and get the topping all over my hands, face and shirt.  On initially taking a bite, the bruschetta is almost cool, yet finishes with a nice bit of heat (but not over the top).  We followed this with my guest ordering the lasagna and I ordered the Papardelle Pasta with Bolognese sauce.  The portion sizes were ample, and of course we shared.  The lasagna was good, albeit a bit different from the sauces I am accustomed to.  If you are looking for a lasagna with a spicy and very meaty sauce, this is not for you.  Rather the flavors are much more subtle.  I thought the noodles were a bit soft, but that is for my taste.  The star of the evening was the bolognese.  Sauce was the perfect thickness, just the right amount of meat, and the herbs and spices were well balanced.  The papardelle pasta was an absolutely perfect match for the sauce.  The noodles were broad enough to hold on the the sauce and allow the full range of flavors in each bite.  Because it is house made fresh, it was not cooked al dente, but it was cooked perfectly with some pull to the pasta when biting. Superb!

We finished with a light desert. It was good, but of course the highlight was the pasta dishes.

Make reservations...and enjoy!",U2cNYvPy5EHkBsp-GIsXaQ,0,0,4,RRfBsR-6LEQXDGZXBM6uxA
1124154,2016-08-22,0,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"Restaurants these days cut corners on special occasions. They either don't recognize them or they will put a candle on your cheese plate and charge you for the puddle of melted cheese. Lupo is not that way.
I reserved the table on open table and in the comments section noted we were celebrating an anniversary. Not all restaurants read the comments, or if they do, don't acknowledge it.
Lupo was different. They had us wait a short bit at the bar so they could get our special table ready. They provided us with champagne for a toast. And at the end they gave us a tiramisu to share with ""happy anniversary"" in chocolate on the plate. If that isn't going above and beyond, I don't know what is.
Since not all come here for a special occasion and it is in a geographically favorable location near the Michael Jackson Cirque show in Mandalay Bay, I should comment more on the food and atmosphere. 
For starters, in a place surrounded by casinos, Lupo was an island. When you are on the island, you are transformed. The service was impeccable. The food is fresh. The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted freshly picked from the garden (are there gardens in Vegas? the wonders of flight...). The pasta is fresh as well. We split the pappardelle bolognese and also had the salmon dish. Both were delicious.
Also they serve bread with an herbed oil and a bean spread. Both were amazing.
They have a good wine list.
The tiramisu had freshly made lady fingers. 
This was my second time there. The previous time I had a simple margherita pizza that hit the spot (yes that was pre-Michael Jackson Cirque show).

I started off with a glass of pearfect martini - very strong. It's suppose to be kettle one vodka with pear puree, but it tasted more like either pear goose or some sort of citron vodka! NOT chilled... :(

My boyfriend and I noticed their menu has changed since we've last been here! No more spaghettti!? por que!?

Any way, Appetizer were sorta kinda the same, but a tad bit different.
We started off with Prosciutto San Daniele, Burrata di Bufala e Pepe Nero (San Daniele Prosciutto, Burrata Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Black Pepper) This dish is exactly the same since our last visit, the mozzarella was light and poofy, it wasn't heavy at all. My boyfriend doesn't like cheese, but for some reason, he really enjoys this dish. 

Bruschetta alla Griglia, Purea di Fagioli, Pomodori, Prezzemolo e Mortadella(Grilled Bruschetta, Bean Puree, Tomatoes, Parsley, Mortadella) EKKKK THE best bruschetta i've ever had, however, they skimped us on the tomatos :(

As for entrees, we ordered :
Linguine alla Vongole, Aglio, Peperoncino, Prezzemolo e Olio Extra Vergine di Oliva(Manila Clams, Chili, Parsley, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) The pasta was very el dente, we kinda like ours a little more softer. As for the clams, they were very flavorful, however, I found this dish a little too salty!

Lastly, I ordered the Mezzo Pollo Arrosto con Scarola, Aglio, Peperoncino, Limone e Vino Bianco
(Pan Roasted Organic Half Chicken, Escarole, Garlic, Chili, Lemon, White Wine) Thinking it's the same roasted chicken from wolfgang puck in san francisco! TOTALLY fooled! Nothing like it, chicken was a little dry, but i really enjoyed the veggies that came with the chicken!

We arrived with a reservation on the allotted time - 6pm. The host seemed a little overwhelmed even though we were the only ones that he had to seat at that time.

He told us that we would be getting menus in a minute and left (turns out he wasn't our waiter). 15 minutes later we finally got our menus after the manager noticed we didn't have any. Our waiter - Devin then showed up and took our drink order. And time for another long wait. At that point we were ready to leave -but decided, based on our previous experience to stay. We ordered our entrees - a pizza, fettuccine Alfredo, a mushroom pasta. When the food reached our table we asked for Parmesan cheese. After 5 minutes our waiter showed up with the cheese. 
The final straw was when I simply asked for a refill on my coke and after 5 minutes realized the waiter completely forgot about it. I called over the manager and asked for a refill. She was very prompt and got it right away. She was the only saving grace in the place.

Lupo looked like it had the best menu, nice atmosphere inside,  and decent prices compared to some of the other Mandalay restaurants. We waited about 15 minutes for a table and were seated outside (with a lovely view of the restrooms across the way and tourists walking around the casino- Yuck!). 

The bread with dipping sauces was probably the best food of the night. We started with some calimari, which was average ($16). 
I ordered the chicken breast piccata ($28). It was one of the worst dishes I have ever had. Normally you would expect your chicken to have a nice golden sear coating tender meat inside. My chicken matched the color of the plate and tasted like it had been boiled lifeless in some kind of onion powdered water- truly repulsive! . Luckily I ordered crispy potatoes ($8) to go with the dish, because when they asked if I wanted to replace it with another entree, I passed. 

The kids ordered 3 pizza's ($15avg only one GIANT hungry man could eat one of these); the sausage and rapini, portobello mushroom, and pepperoni. When they brought the pizza's they delivered the pepperoni and mushroom, and a margherita- so that went back right away. My son had to wait another 15 minutes for his sausage pizza to come out. When it finally arrived, it turned out to be the worst pizza we have ever had. The rapini tastes like a combination of a brussel sprout and kale- think bitter seafood- bleck! The sausage was also terrible, bland and mealy, with a jarred spices kind of flavor. We decided to send this back. The kids were super embarrassed that we were sending back a second meal. 

So thank you Lupo for giving me the opportunity to teach the kids that you shouldn't unnecessarily part with your hard earned cash, especially if you have a terrible dining experience (dinner was still $70 plus $10 tip). And that they actually do recover from the embarrassment of their parents sending food back to the kitchen. 

The only saving grace of the night was that the waiter was apologetic and did try to make it right. I just don't know what you are supposed to do when your kitchen is sending out food of such poor, amateur quality.

We sat at the bar. Michael took great care of us.  Made us 4 great Lemon Drop Shots. Chilled. & Heavy. Wife had Kale Salad, I had the Bruschetta Appetizer w/ Ricotta & Soppreseta. AWESOME.

For Entrees, i did what i never do. I ordered PASTA. Bucatini in a marinara w/ guancale and onion and chili flakes and pecorino cheese. Al dente high quality pasta. BEST gravy sauce i have ever had. I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate. Wife said Salmon was off the hook, high level quality.

Here is the great service part. Our bill came out to $136.  I gave them a WOLFGANG PUCK gift card that had $148.40 on it.  Their POS server was down and not reading the Gift Cards at all.  Rather than force me to pay via credit card or cash, the GM Griffin came and said you seem trustworthy and i will take you at your word which i appreciated. Im a restaurant owner from Chicago. I gave them my business card and proof of where i was staying in Vegas and room number.  

Here is the funny part. We were having lunch in Spago the next day and who walks in? Michael, our bartender. He was there to help out with a private event. Said card went through later, no problem.  And thanked me for generous tip.

Our waiter read us the specials, did he say dover sole?  Okay, I had to ponder that option.  We started with the calamari for appetizer and the buffalo mozzarella.  Both were very good, seasoned well.  I did end up getting the dover sole filleted table side and I have to say, it was perfectly prepared and perfectly deboned.   I requested veggies only on the side instead of a starch so it was served with a bunch of grilled Italian style veggies.  My favorite!  Perfect, light choice of a dinner.

I felt the food was good but not outstanding.  I don't know a ton about Wolfgang Puck, but my colleagues told me that one of the dishes he was well known for was raviolis.  So I tried some, and although they were good, I didn't feel like they were amazing, and they didn't exactly fill me up.  I also had the steamed spinach which was of generous portion, but a little chewy.  One of my coworkers had the pork chop which was HUMONGOUS and he said very delicious.  Guess I'd need to go back again and try something else on the menu...

Also, their beginning bread service is a bunch of hard, long breadsticks wrapped in a cloth napkin and handed around.  The logistics of this was messy and rather annoying.  Why not have fresh, warm bread - or at least breadsticks in an easy to pass container.  Also, the breadsticks were so long that most people were breaking them in half.  Maybe just have shorter breadsticks???

All in all a good meal, but not amazing in my opinion.  The service was good and they attended to our group of 9 pretty efficiently.  Looking for a good sit down meal in Mandalay at a ""reasonable"" price, I'd definitely recommend the Tratorria del Lupo.

I opted for the green fettuccine with mushrooms, peas and parmesan truffle sauce. Eh - just okay. I'm not sure why, gain I can't place my finger on why, but it just didn't wow me. It tasted kind of greasy and not at all like parmesan sauce. The portions are pretty small and when you are spending $27 for a pasta, it should be out of the world! 

For dessert, I ordered some lemon thing. I call it a think because I can't even explain what it is (neither could the waiter), it was so nasty that I took one bite and sent it back.

We made a reservation at 5:15, with plenty of time before a 7:00 show. We were seated promptly by the friendly girl at the front. And then it all went downhill.

1) No children's menu. We had two 10-year olds with us, one is a picky eater. I know, what were we thinking, but we were able to find something for them (we thought).

2) Kitchen problems of some time delayed our meals. The waiter finally showed up with a ""complimentary calimari appetizer"". My wife and I ate 1-2 bites, the rest of the party did not want them. So why would you just dump something on the table to make up for a delay caused by their kitchen?? Most places would offer something, or maybe comp dessert. Did not score any points on that one.

3) Food finally arrived. Pasta dishes were okay, not great. Kids did not care for their food. We were all pretty hungry and kids had headaches, so no one really enjoyed the meal.

4) By this time, we had to leave or we would miss this show (in the same complex, so a 5 minute walk). Waiter exclaimed that he was preparing a complimentary dessert for all, but I told him we had to leave. A nice gesture, but we told him up front we had show tickets, so we had to leave.

Lessons learned....... not a kid-friendly dining place. Food may be hit and miss. Was a lot better years ago when we ate here.

Handmade fettuccini with mushrooms, peas, and pea tendrils -- yummy, but it was missing something for me (probably sometime hot). This was the only entree that we ordered. The size was good and the pasta was well made, but it did not blow me away.

I was NOT blown away. The food was good enough, but we had eaten appetizers at a different restaurant before hand. If we hadn't then I would have been sorely disappointed by this restaurant.

We had: 

Lobster risotto which is different from the risotto listed online. It had cherry tomatoes, garlic, basil, and tea. It was super amazing. The risotto wasn't too soft, and the flavor was great. It was a healthy portion as well, not puny at all considering it's a fancy restaurant. 

Pork chop with pork belly. The pork belly was nice and sweet, very much honey-glazed. The pork chop on the other hand was crispy on the outside and looked tough on the inside because I asked for almost well done, but it tasted just fine and not dry with the sauce it came with. 

Drinks:
Riesling - I don't know wine, but supposedly very clean. =] and yummy
Pineapple cooler - pineapple juice with yummy stuff. Very very yummy.

Pat offered dessert but we just didn't have room! It's ok, another reason to come back and try them.

Split a salad (4/5), which gave us good portions individually.  Told them we were splitting it so they split it onto individual plates for us.

Fettuccine Alfredo (4/5) - Looked very good, asked to add chicken, and basically, they dropped an entire chicken quarter w/ crispy skin on top of the fett alfredo,  which cost an add'l $8-10 (can't remember exact number), would have preferred some grilled chicken slices instead of a whole chicken quarter just sitting on top, fett alfredo by itself was very good

Bolognese (5/5) - Whatever type of handmade noodles they're serving w/ their bolognese sauce is what you want to order; this sauce was EXCELLENT and a shame we couldn't take the leftovers cuz we had no fridge in the hotel room that we could use, just a shame to leave that behind",AQxmbuDiToMv2WYtq4Mfdw,1,1,4,WkvUwt4uSM2WjQrNzRTeCw

I was promptly given a table and the waiter took my order diligently. I was able to enjoy a glass of sweet vermouth while waiting for my meal.

They were good so I don't want it to come out wrong. 

For entrees we had the veal chop first which I honestly wish I didn't have to share. It was that good and worth every penny of the 68 dollars they charge for it. Tender and cooked to perfection.  

Our second entree was the sole, this unfortunately had the absolute opposite of the veal. No flavor, very bland and do not recommend. The entire table agreed, I did politely tell the manager when he came back to chat.

Third entree was a pasta with a veal ragout, simple and perfect.  Fresh Tagliatelle frutti de mare  and the right amount of sauce. Lobster meat, shrimp and scallops.. This was amazing.. 

It was my birthday and they bought the table desserts which was a really nice touch. Would absolutely go back...

The broccollini was tasty too and just crunchy, not mushy.  The lasagna was very good with a bechamel and red sauce that  made for a rich tasting dish.  This lasagna was not the crispy kind, but was firm and made with green and white pasta.  The shrimp on the appetizer were cook just right - firm and very tasty.  The desserts were excellent.  The lemon curd zeppoli were hot and freshly prepared.  The tiramisu was creamy and delicious and not overpowered with chocolate.  Getting there around 6 pm avoids the noise and long wait that we saw later at 8 pm.  Only complaint was the rock music in a nice restaurant.

The positive: 
*They make pasta fresh and you can certainly taste the difference.
*The service was very friendly.  

The negative: 
*They told us we'd wait 20 minutes for a table, but we waited well over 30.
*It took forever to get us our food.
*We had to ask more than once to get napkins.  Not extra napkins, just napkins.
*The wine list is not great for such a fancy Italian restaurant
*The roasted beet & arugula salad with goat cheese was awful, and cost $18.

We chose Lupo since we love Italian food and the atmosphere seemed nice. 
Unfortunately, the experience was not. 

The hostess completely ignored us for the longest time although we were the only waiting couple, after which she said that the wait is 1h, although there were many empty tables. The appetizers took a long time to get to us and they arrived along with main course. 
We ordered only 3 items: bruschetta, carpaccio and pizza and frankly I had a problem with all of them. 
Bruschetta had literally 1 cherry tomato cut in half on a piece of bread and way too much cheese which felt more like a grilled-cheese sandwich rather than bruschetta. Pizza was way too sweet and carpaccio was most disappointing of all. It had weird hard strings on top of it which, as I found out later were ""crispy"" artichoke stripes that weren't mentioned in the menu. I think they were supposed to be crispy, but in reality it was absolutely horrible, I felt like I'm eating a fish full of bones that I constantly have to take out of my mouth. I'm a carpaccio lover and I had it in many different places. This one barely had any parmesan, no capers and this weird overdone artichoke which made it the worst carpaccio I've ever tasted. 
I'm a European and I know the food will never be the same as in Italy, but even without high expectations, it was just a sad experience.",X1Dc6fF4haW4eVlCDnxIHg,0,0,1,CMpKKdWXfaTXXiY5ujZVYA

We had a beer, sangria, mojito, and 2 glasses of wine. All of them were fantastic and reasonably priced for this type of establishment.

We started off with the mussels which were juicy, flavorful and served with garlic bread. Although garlic bread by itself was pretty good, I felt like the regular bread they served at the beginning of the meal paired better with the broth. We also ordered a margarita pizza which was great as well. The cheese and sauce paired together very well and the crust was nice and crunchy.

We had the Bolognese and the carbonara pasta as shareable entrees. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauces were delicious. However I like the bolognese better than the carbonara because it had a lot more richer flavor where as the carbonara was heavy. 

To end our meal we ordered a Lemon Souffle which was tart and soft. I really enjoyed it.

Details:  It was just after 9 PM on a Wednesday night.  I was hungry, so I thought I'd try Lupo.  I walked up to the hostess stand and asked for a table.  ""One, please"", I asked.  She asked if I preferred a table or if I would like to sit at the bar.  I asked for the table, please.  She told me it would be a couple of minutes while they ""cleared off a table"", but from the hostess stand I could see at least 10 empty tables, with placed settings and ready to go.

After a couple of minutes, a party of three people came up behind me.  I was still standing at the hostess stand, so I politely stepped aside so those people could talk to the hostess.  She asked them how many.  They said three.  She grabbed three menus and said ""right this way"".  I wondered to myself why those people were being seated immediately, but I said nothing and  continued to wait patiently.

After a few more minutes a couple walked up to the hostess stand.  Just as with the previous party, the hostess asked how many.  They said two.  She grabbed two menus and said ""right this way"".  I continued to wait patiently.

The hostess came back to the stand.  She didn't say a word to me.  She just fidgeted around with whatever was on the podium.  After a couple of minutes, she walked away from the podium, leaving me standing there, still waiting.  I finally decided Lupo wasn't earning my business, so I left.

It is Las Vegas, so I'm sure they get their fair share of obnoxious people that they might like to avoid serving.  However, I was stone-sober, dressed in slacks, a button down shirt and tie.  And I was polite the whole time.  

Perhaps this is a good restaurant if they like you, but if they ignored me they may also ignore you.  If you want to try this restaurant, I'd recommend having a back-up plan in case they decide they aren't serious about your business.",qKf8-wfF95NxGJlGUWuZ1A,4,0,1,C9LUZNUNwIovmudJ1n48og

The atmosphere was very pretty, with the dark woods and leather seating.  Our table - a great, long, high top - situated along the right side as you entered the restaurant, was a bit uncomfortable, though.  The chairs were extremely heavy, making it a bit difficult to scoot into your place. A few of us needed assistance getting in AND out of the seating during the dinner. 

Highlights of our orders included the Black Bass, which got rave reviews from my fellow diner.  My husband had the Eggplant Lasagne and was thrilled with it.  Several in our group ordered the Rib Eye with Arugula and all were happy.  I ordered the Pasta Carbonara, one of my favorite pasta dishes.  Unfortunately, the dish was overwhelmed with the taste of the Pancetta, which normally is well cooked (sautéed??), small in size, with a certain crispness.  This plate had somewhat heavy ""chunks"" of the meat, and I felt the meat was undercooked.  

We did ask the servers to bring a variety of appetizers beforehand, though, and they did not disappoint - Bruschetta, Calamari, Olives, Artisanal Salume Plate.   Desserts were delicious and included Zeppole and Tiramisu.

The wait staff were attentive and friendly, although, a few items did slip through the cracks.   Almost all of the group partook of the wines that were ordered, but an iced tea order was forgotten about, as was another non-alcoholic beverage.   After dinner, too, we were one coffee short with the dessert service.  It was rectified, though, as was the iced tea, earlier.

The overall experience was good, but I think that the service could have been a bit more ""on point"" and also, the Pasta Carbonara fell short of my expectations.",NAQ8YKxuA-zsBKJ6RdBx6g,1,0,4,NnQKFJiJ6RYd3Etip1jjOg

We started with a caprese salad that had little to no flavor.  When my bucatini all'amatriciana it was nothing like the photo..it was not even bucatini...my a homemade pasta mess of a bad and soggy fetuccini.  The sauce had no flavor.   The Italian manager tried to explain to me that is was bucatini all'amatriciana and I could see he was having a horrible time trying to hide the fact he agreed it was not.  I think replaced it with a tri-colore salad that was basically an over-dressed mixed green.   I figured you can't go wrong with desert so we ordered the apple pie desert with homemade gelato that will go down in history as the worst desert I've had.   The ice cream had zero flavor and my friend and I were in shock.  I would skip this!!!,6Fy8DfW3ICQMl70oM67cSw,0,0,1,unYLQBDr-o9i8AeBUhuQgw

To start they brought out breadsticks which my hubby and I gobbled up quickly - we were starving. Then they brought out some fresh bread with a white bean puree spread and a black olive spread. I loved the white bean spread, the Olive spread was OK - a little too salty so I avoided it. 

We both skipped the salad / soup. I ordered a short rib with polenta and veggies - it was excellent. The rib melted in your mouth. They put a little red wine reduction over it and the polenta was perfect. Can't remember what hubby's main course was (mine was so good!) 

I thoroughly enjoyed this meal and recommend this place.

Pro: Romantic and quiet on the inside... hard to believe its in a Vegas hotel.

Moderate prices which is nice but we are talkin' Italian and not steak here.

Good service. We came on a Sunday for dinner and it was slow so we got about 3 servers helping us out.

With it being slow, we of course got seated quickly. There are no booths but there are half booth, half chair style seats. We chose that and sat close to some other people, sort of a con since this place was so empty.

The server was nice enough to take our italian donuts off the check since it was my bf's birthday. Sweet! 

The bf's starter house salad was great and my calmari came with some really good sauce... made me sad I couldn't finish or take it home as we were going out that night after dinner.

The bf's lasagna he says was excellent.

Prices were really reasonable for a sit down dinner in Vegas. We ordered two drinks, two sodas, two entrees, two starters for a check of a little over $100! Not bad! I thought it would have topped $150 but that wasn't the case.

The coffee was excellent. Definitely perked me up for our night!

The servers were kind and kept our refills going. They were pretty talkative and friendly as well.

Cons: The clam fetticcini (sp?) was just okay. The noodles were a little too al dente for my taste and it could have used more seasoning. The clams were small and just okay. 

The breadstick that they gave us was really weird. It was the length of the table and just seemed different but weird trying to break off a piece and crunching it as you are trying to have a conversation, hmm. We sorta left it there.

The service was nice but with food on my plate being hard to eat, I had to give this place a 3.",Njf7ZCmrI0IjX0cKlHQpGw,1,0,3,f6A2o3YDdfXCFl9azmFibg

She was very friendly, funny, and took really good care of us.  Our other server, Brendan, was just as helpful and friendly.

We had a five course tasting menu (some of the dishes were not on the regular menu).  We started with a beet salad with burratta cheese topped with beet chips and balsamic reduction.  A nice and refreshing way to start the meal.

Next was a lamb ravioli served with sun-dried tomatoes and peas topped with shaved white truffle.  very flavorful dish.  I loved the flavor of the lamb in those small ravioli bites.  Didn't taste as much truffle as I expected...but I think the strong flavor of the lamb overpowers the flavor of the truffle.

Next came halibut with garlic aioli on asparagus and chanterelle mushroom.  a light dish.  the halibut was cooked perfectly

Main course consisted of three strips of ribeye steak with parsnip puree, lamb jus, balsamic reduction and rhubarb reduction sauce (which was excellent).  Steak was very tender and had a lot of flavor

The waiter surprised me by explaining to her the different pasta options that could be made vegetarian. Unlike most waiters in high-end restaurants, he was gracious, patient, and seemed genuinely-interested in educating her and helping my guest find something that she would be able to eat -- and, more importantly -- enjoy.

She choose poorly, and ended up selecting a salad instead of pasta. When it turned out that the salad was not to her taste, our waiter promptly removed it. My guest (finally) chose a pasta, which she found delicious. Notably, our waiter waived the charge for the salad.

The graciousness of this service was exceptional. It was generous in spirit. I would heartily recommend this restaurant on this basis alone.

I'd expect to ask for no anchovies or croutons or parmesan (gasp, I would NEVER), but ""hold the chili flakes?""  Um. NO. Sorry. I've said it before and I'll say it again, pepper of ANY kind on ANY salad should be left to the discretion of the person consuming it.

So on the off chance that I'm not in the majority, please ask them to hold the chili flakes on the caesar.

Food was delicious, prices weren't too bad considering this place is nicer than Spago's and prices were about the same.
They had a decent wine list with a bunch of Chiantis and Grigios.
My dish was one of the best, if not the best pork dish I have ever eaten.
A Maple Glazed Karabuto Pork Chop cooked medium-rare.
Wayy too delicious to even begin to describe.
Came with some broccolini and a creamy polenta, I want to say cauliflower polenta.
The Caesar dressing was on point as well.

I ordered the bruschetta - it was fabulous. 

I followed that up with their mushroom pasta dish at the advice of the server who said it was his favorite and it was seriously sooooo fabulous that I ended up eating almost all of it and I was already pretty full on appetizer and bread.

I should say from the outset, I'm not a Vegas fan. I don't like the sensory overload experience. However, I find myself coming here a few times a year. Historically, I stay off the strip and find restaurants in the netherlands of the Vegas metro area. This trip required that we stay on the Strip. I was a bit concerned about our eating options.

Lupo did not disappoint. The house-made pasta, the generously cut meats, the fantastic salads - everything about Lupo is a really top-notch dining experience. We had out 3 year old with us. We ordered a ""cheese pizza"" (not an item on the menu, but the server kindly helped to make it happen) and our daughter did not like the artisan nature of the pie. The server saw her discontent and helped to get a dish of pasta in butter and cheese sauce.

If you find yourself in Vegas and on the Strip (umm, I guess that is a bit of a misnomer statement; as everyone who comes to Las Vegas eventually comes to the Strip) - make Lupo an evening event.

One of the better rewards I was lucky enough to snag in the couple minutes that it sold out in was the 2-for-1 Chef's Tasting Dinner for 200,000 LPs. This covered $150 of the bill (price for one person). 

I have never been part of such a fancy dinner in my life!

The first thing the chef did was check in with us to see if we had any dietary restrictions. Then, as customary, he took our drink orders. We were surprised to learn a glass of wine only averaged about $10 with our dinner. My mom mistakenly ordered a red wine when she meant white, so we switched. The chef then offered to get us a new one, which was super nice of course; but we were fine.

He also asked if we had any time restrictions. We did, as we had the shark reef at 7 pm and a then a show in another hotel. (Our reservation at Lupo was at 5 pm). He was able to make sure we left on time.

I don't know the names of all the dishes, they were too fancy for my vocabulary. I know the first dish was some kind of raw meat, I think a beef carpaccio dish? After that, I don't know the order, only that we had some fish, some delicious pea ravioli, shrimp and vegetables, a pistachio soufflé with raspberry gelato, and a chocolate layered ice cream-like dessert.

Everything was heavenly. The sauces and spices that made the flavoring of all the dishes were the best and most unique I have EVER had. It is no wonder this restaurant is so highly renown and this dinner so pricey! And oh my god, how did he know I love pistachio flavored anything, and soufflés are of course my favorite dessert! He combined them and I was stunned by my tingling tastebuds. It was like they were singing in joy.

Our total came to $183 including the 2 glasses of wine. We tipped $50 taking in account for the $150 we didn't have to pay for... but now rethinking this amount while not drinking, I think we should have tipped more.... like $15 more? Well, next time...

Going to see the new show, For the Record: Baz which is playing across the hall from Lupo, I had the perfect opportunity to finally stop here for dinner.

I was seated promptly.  I was given a choice of inside the main part or their indoor patio style seating.  I chose inside the restaurant to avoid the noise of the people going to/from the parking garage.  

Shortly after being seated, I was brought menus and my server, Miguel, took my iced tea order and it was quickly brought to the table.  After asking a few questions about serving sizes, I ordered the heirloom tomato soup with basil to start, listed as one of the daily specials, and the lasagna verde ""della nonna"" with spinach pasta, meat sauce and béchamel.  For a side, I got an order of lemon cauliflower.

Bread service was brought with two dipping sauces.  The serving assistant asked me about freshly grated cheese and/or pepper, and I got both.  The tomato soup was outstanding.  It was rich and full of flavor.  I highly recommend this if it's on the menu.

The main course of lasagna verde was good.  The serving size was more than ample and the meat sauce was very good.  The spinach pasta gave the lasagna a slightly different taste that enhanced the dish.  The side of lemon cauliflower was very good.  Lightly browned cauliflower with more than a hint of lemon topped with some grated cheese, made for a great side dish.  This was the only thing I didn't finish in order to save room for dessert.

After looking at the items on the menu, I got the mascarpone tart which was accompanied by fresh strawberries and an oval of sorbet.  This was a refreshing end to a good meal.

We were seated quickly upon our arrival with reservation in hand and the server was pleasant and accommodating.  Complimentary bread was brought out with a olive oiI and slightly spicy tempanade.  I requested more bread, but it never came. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and a couple beers which were also promptly delivered.  I ordered the seafood pasta (fancier name on the menu, but I forgot what it was), and it had nice pieces of lobster, scallops, and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  My wife ordered the parpadelle bolognese, and I think I actually liked hers better than mine, and vice versa.  Why we didn't switch plates, I'll never know, probably because we were both hungry!  My father-in-law ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and he seemed to really enjoy it, although he felt the meatballs were a little salty.  Keep in mind, he used to own an Italian restaurant, so to each their own.  My mother-in-law ordered the swordfish which was tasty and came on a bed of chickpeas, which was different instead of something like a rice pilaf or mashed potatoes.  My mother-in-law really enjoyed the bites of everyone's pasta, which means it was really good, because she's not a pasta person.  The prices are a little high, but with the name, and the fancier style setting, you get what you pay for.

This is the second Wolfgang restaurant I've been to in Vegas.  My conclusion is that they're both good but nothing spectacular.  

BUT, I must say that we LOVED the CAESAR SALAD.  Something about the dressing was different and good.  They sprinkle red pepper flakes on top which gives it a nice balance.  My bf and I shared a margherti pizza.  It was good but nothing special.  I did like that they put more cheese than average because it bulked it up a bit.  My bf said that he wishes the crust was crispier.  The long bread appetizer they give you is cool.  You get a white bean dipping sauce and a olive tapanade dipping sauce.  I enjoyed the bean one and my bf like the olive one...I ended up dipping my pizza in the rest of the bean sauce. hmm..",S2WLt6HQEcv48Rgm8cmz5w,0,0,3,drjopYCxlpruDntCx7WsLg

Main course (lamb, pork chop, and chicken piccata) was served beautifully. The pork chop was way under cooked but was sent back without question from our server & returned even better. The pork chop was to die for! Chicken piccata - nothing special or filling. The lamb was off menu special & was a large serving. Amazing with the goat cheese polenta & roasted veggies! 

Dessert was served for the table, complimentary birthday dessert (delicious chocolate/hazelnut mousse I believe) and mini donuts were sent due to the undercooked entree.

Within 3 minutes, a server came to pour us water and we were soon greeted by our waiter, who took our drink order. She had an ice tea and I had an Arnold Palmer. I don't know if we severely dehydrated but glasses were ridiculously small and required too many refills to count. The tea had a floral note and was a highlight of the meal; we both agreed. The prixe fixe was 3 courses. My friend chose a burrata salad, pasta bolognese, and tiramisu. I had the calamari, pasta bolognese, and panna cotta. We both agreed that our pasta course was the best one. The handmade noodles were a standout with the meat sauce. While we waited for our appetizers, we were given bread with a olive oil/olive tapenade that was tasty. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the service was a tad bit on the slow side.

You can taste the depths of flavor in all their dishes. Totally well balanced flavors. They definitely taste everything they make and know exactly how muchthey needed to add if necessary. Kids had stuff off the menu which I think is a challenge for the kitchen, not difficult but can be easily messed up with imperfections of the dish screaming bad flavor or presentation. They respected all the ingredients used in in my children's dish including the prosciutto. My kids had a butter parmasean pasta with a heaping of prosciutto. They just sliced the whole ham over the dishes. Seriously great!!!! So many things to compliment the chefs that cooked us a fantastic meal again!!!!

The ambiance was very NYC. The room had dark wood and the round tables are laid out in a circle around the bar. While Vicki was taking our drink order, another gentleman took our food order. Perfect! Efficient!

I started with the proscuitto and burrata. Hello, is that heaven calling? I think so.

For my meal, I split the Grilled Salmon with another one of the ladies. It was divine. I am glad we split it as the single portion was quite large for me. The cedar flavor really came through in the fish. It had a nice crisp edge and a tender, flaky inside. The flavor was smokey, light, and not fishy at all. It was served with oven roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach. Beware, the spinach has slivers of garlic. Do not eat if you plan on making out later. ;-)

I had the Elderflower Martini - clean, floral, delicious. Yummy.

Arrived promptly at 5pm for dinner service and sat down very quickly as they just opened.  The restaurant is located towards the parking for Delano hotel.  It's the last stop on your left before exiting the casino.

Appetizers - Shrimp scampi (GAMBERI ALLA ISCHITANA).  Not what I was expecting, BETTER.  The shrimps were delivered in creamy white bean puree.  It was buttery and delicious

Dinner - Chicken piccata with Kale and we also had spaghetti bolognese.  Both plates were hearty enough to fill your stomach and tasty enough to satisfy your italian cravings.  We ordered the cauliflower as a side dish (CAVOLFIORI ALLA TOSCANA) and that was sooo good.  Not something I would usually ordered, but WOW.

My friend got some cherry martini which was super strong but still tasted pretty good.

Food: My friend and I split the pizza with sausage and rapini (Italian style broccoli). It was delicious!

He brings us the check with the items we asked him to remove still on there so he goes back and brings us the check the 3rd time.  4th time to collect the payment, without offering to make up for not remembering to bring us our missing food initially.

We started with a Caesar salad and bruschetta. Both were very bland and forgettable. I don't mind paying a pretty penny for the strip, but if the quality if not there it is extra painful! 

The salad was especially bad. It really was the most bland caesar I've ever had. No flavor of citrus, egg yolk, Parmesan, pepper, or anchovy to be found. It tasted like romaine dipped in mayo. It had a few pine nuts thrown in. It had some red pepper flakes in it, which were really strange. Every once in a while I would get a really spicy bight. It didn't blend well with the other mild flavor. 

We ordered lamb shank and sea bass in broth. 
The lamb shank was typical braised (pressure cooked?) lamb and just didn't wow me. Parts were dry. The sauce was good but there was very little of it, and the lamb without the sauce was bland. The kale that came with it was good but I would have preferred it a little more al dente. 

When the sea bass came it had a pretty fishy odor, and not in a yummy fish sauce way but an old fish way. I was scared the fish would taste old, but it was fine. 
The bass was very crispy but the portion was quite stingy. The broth was ok once I got used to the very stinky smell. It came with a few shrimp and lobsters which were ok. the flavor was a bit bland for my taste.

First up is the Ricotta Gnocchi which was out of this world great; It was fully flavorful and cooked with great care.  I know it sounds odd, but sometimes it can be a little overcooked to the point when it almost seems like a rubbery ball of cheese (though anything with cheese is still good).  However, this establishment's version was cooked so well that the exterior merely held the wonderful flavors inside rather than detracting from the overall taste. Definitely one of the better gnocchi dishes that I've had, 5+ stars.
Second on our list was the Green Lasagna.  Now, don't laugh at my naivety (or stupidity) but I expected green to mean vegetarian, so I was happily surprised when the meal arrived at I realized that there was meat inside 0:-).  Overall, the meal was very good as it tasted great and had a smooth consistency like a knife through warm butter, yet firm enough to refrain from spilling out.  It also had a great blend of flavors as their cheese-to-meat-to-pasta ratio was spot on and I also recommend this dish to others, 4 stars.

Being in love with Italian food, I'm always weary of restaurants that come with high praise because quite often they fail.  However, Lupo exceeded my expectations and definitely fit the bill of what people expect from a Puck-staurant.",LPR-Nt6TrLq1P-UDmO-cLQ,1,0,5,WnNkJe5BQh1Vnko9A3hgqw

I ordered the fungi pizza and asked for additional toppings. Was good taste. Bruschetta was good too.

SERVICE: Totally 5 star all the way. Eric our server was fantastic as was chef Tiva (amazing chef and artist) and Kellen the manager. They were all very professional and classy in the service they gave our entire party. These guys know what they are doing when it comes to fine dining. 

FOOD: 
We started with the Cozza Al Medditeranea. The mussels dish. Very good with a perfect blend of tomato sauce and salt and pepper. 

Then we got the Veal Tanado. Very ingesting dish. It's raw veal (like a carpaccio) and it was very good. We all liked it. 

For dinner we got the Beef Bolognese hand made pasta. BEST THING ON THE MENU. So good if you love red sauce pasta. Def highly recommended. 

I got the Scapolini Di Vitello. Very good veal dish. I also recommend this dish if you like veal. Has Caramelized drizzle on the top with cheese and arugula. 

Niece got the Fettuccini Alfredo. Simple and cannot go wrong with this dish. 

Wife got the Ravioli. She liked it and said it was good but preferred the Bolognese instead. 

BUT THE DESSERTS! 

We got all of them! 
Pistachio soufflé:  Best dessert on the menu! 
Zepeli Italian donut: Simple and sweet with some very good side sauces to dip in. 
Strawberry tart: Also good 
Hermoso:  Chocolate cake that has crumbles at the bottom. This was my favorite. 
Lemon budino. Italian pudding. Least favorite. Very tarty dish. 
A variety of different flavored Canoli's. So good!

  Two of our three meals were very good, but the portions were pretty small except for the spaghetti and meatballs. It was an OK portion worthy of getting again.

Come on Las Vegas, fresh house made pasta, perfectly crafted thin crust pizza and an amazing wine list.

Really?

A party of five who is beyond lazy but knows collectively that ""we"" want Italian for dinner. I personally don't have the energy to skip down the Strip to the Venetian and figured eating within walking distance of my hotel would suffice. 

I did a quick check on my trusty iphone Yelp app and found Lupo. The reviews were lackluster at best, but after a hard days work of golf, nap, drinks at the Foundation Room and an amazing caviar appetizer I (we) were in need of something quick and easy. 

From the elevator I was able to secure a 7:30 reservation (and awarded 1000 points by the way) and me and four hungry guys headed over to Lupo. We were greeted by two awesome hostesses who immediately seated us towards the back nearest the open kitchen. Within a few minutes our waiter came right over and took cocktail orders and presented us with the wine list. I did a quick scan and found a moderately priced zin from Tobin James in Paso Robles and before we knew it our drinks and bottle of wine were brought right over.

It was now time to order and let me tell you right here. You cannot get five guys together in an Italian restaurant and not have pizza. We got one to split with meatballs and OH! yes, it was good. Slightly burnt crust  and simple but flavorful toppings, I thought there was no way our entrees could top this.

I was wrong.

My 
Scialatielli ""Ai Quattro Passi"" con Salsicce alla Bolognese, Basilico e Lamelle di Parmigian (yes copied and pasted from the online menu) was amazing! And the portion size was gigantic. It was so huge that after I was finished the waiter looked at me and asked if the dish was ""not to my liking"", because he thought I had not touched it. Trust me, I loved every bite, but the Flintstone plate of pasta was more than any man could handle.

This place is in no way a 3 1/2 star restaurant. Everything from the service to the food is a hit. And as I lay here in bed, I am half contemplating getting dressed and head back down there for seconds.

There is ample seating inside the restaurant for a more intimate setting, or along the restaurant row walkway overlooking the resort.

There is also bar seating with flatscreen TVs for you sports fanatics. Since there was NFL Thursday Night football playing, we sat at the bar.

All of the restaurants in restaurant row appear tantalizing! You can just pick one and would not be disappointed! Dress code can be described as beautiful, business, or casual attire.

Lupo has an extensive wine selection, as well as a full bar! My poison for the evening was the Wolfgang Puck Cabernet Sauvignon  :)

Lupo also has a wide array of salads, pizzas, pastas and other main dishes, including steak and seafood. I had the Caesar Salad and Salmone, both of which were mouthwatering! 

Service was exceptional, however, the bartenders seemed more on the ""professional"" side, and not as ""chatty"" or conversational as some of the other restaurants at the Mandalay Bay, in my opinion. I think next time we will be dining in the restaurant. Otherwise, the food was exceptional! Another Wolfgang Puck winner!

Parking: As with most hotels and resorts along The Strip, there are ample parking at the Mandalay Bay's hotel parking lot, by either valet or self-park. There is also parking at the Luxor, with a quick walk across the bridge through the Shops at Mandalay Bay which connects the two resorts, or also a quick tram ride with Luxor and Excalibur. If you don't already know, most Las Vegas resorts are now charging for parking! Mandalay Bay is one of several MGM resorts so if you are checked in and ask for a parking card, it helps parking and dining at other MGM resorts.",ACevyfccyNxXntWld8hvmg,1,1,4,2jurTAre5goLxg1UEdredQ

The service is slow, even when the restaurant is empty. I like to think it's because they are making everything from scratch. But whatever the reason, allow yourself some time.

The atmosphere is about as authentic as it can be considering its location. The prices are about what you would expect for a nice restaurant in a more expensive casino.

5056804,2013-01-24,2,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"I took my friend here on a Saturday night. After dinner we both looked at each other and decided that this was in the top 10 of our favorite meals. Like EVER. 
We made reservations, and were seated immediately. We asked for a table ""inside"" instead of ""outside"" where you are in the casino area and can people watch. Inside just seemed a little more intimate, and nicer for conversation. We were seated in a booth which was very comfy! Our server Steve was AMAAAAAZING. Like beyond amazing. Here is why. 

After we ordered our drinks (bottle of Prosecco), I asked about the artichoke salad that I had heard so much about, but couldn't find on the menu. He said it was no longer on the menu, but he would ask the chef if they could make it just for us. And guess what - They could!!! Not only was I SOOOO excited (it was AMAZING by the way, and lived up to it's rumors of greatness), but I can't believe he offered. That was going above and beyond of us, and it just made us feel extra special. We also ordered the mussels as our appetizer, and it was another flavorful dish. My friend let Steve know that she only ate fish (no meat products), and he told her that the white bean puree they bring out at the start of the meal is cooked with pork. Once again, exceeding our expectations and letting us know what foods she could and couldn't eat. 

Our entrees were just an flavorful and delicious as our appetizers. I had the lamb chops which were to die for! They were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The cheesy grits were amazing, but knowing I was going to order dessert, I only ate half. My friend had the Branzino (sea bass), and was extremely pleased. She cleaned her whole plate, so obviously she enjoyed it. 

DESSERT - oh Steve, you haven't let us down yet, so what do you recommend? The cheesecake he said. We looked at him like he was crazy. The best dessert you have is cheesecake? Really Steve? Well, we are both fans of friends warm desserts, so we had to get the Zeppole (little doughnuts with caramel sauce). BUT we decided to splurge and get the cheesecake too. OMG - Steve didn't let us down! It was THE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER HAD. And when I say the BEST, I really mean it. It was a creamy dream. It was so flavorful (ricotta & mascarpone cheeses), and the graham cracker crust added the perfect crunch. The Zeppole was delicious too (we ate all 6). 

Should you come here? YES. ABSOLUTELY. DON'T THINK ABOUT GOING ANYWHERE BUT HERE. It was amazing. When you have SOOO many places in Vegas that have amazing food, the good service really stands out. If I eat good food, but the service is bad I won't come back. If the food is good and the service is AMAZING like it was here at Lupo, I will not only come back, but I'll write a review on Yelp and tell everyone I know they have to come here for dinner.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,2,1,5,wwGzdV_fQYQGQ8kkS7fBcQ

I was disappointed that there wasn't any pasta on our menu and/or there weren't more choices.  I ate the chicken dish which was flavorful while others had the lamb which they said, was excellent.  The rest of the entree was sparse.  Outside of the meat, we received a small amount of spinach on the plate, that's it.  I'm not sure if that's how it is or the company didn't pay for anything more.  The service was excellent along with the wines, antipasti and bread sticks.  Overall, the place has potential judging by what we ate and drank that night.

Top props for antipasti, the incredible Zuppa di Fagioli e Farro.  Yep a simple white bean soup.  Creamy from the beans, a subtle heat from the garlic, a hint of rosemary, and acidic balance from tomatoes.  So simple, so good.

For pasta, the Scialatelli Ai Quattro Passi (home made, pasta in a sausage Bolognese) is hard to beat.  Perfectly al dente fresh pasta and a rich, mildly spicy sauce.

Finally, save room for desert.  This foodie actually went with a group of buddies and ordered them all.  The 15 layer flourless chocolate cake with hazelnuts is amazing.  Not overly sweet, not excessively rich.  Perfect with that double espresso.

Portions are very large.  Any single starter or pizza can be a meal in itself.  If possible, share.  The restaurant splits the dishes in the kitchen so the presentation is excellent.

The wine list has become more interesting, packed with unique selections with an emphasis on Italian varietals.   Prices remain are good.  Average bottle price: $50.

Tip:  Use yelp to book your reservation.  It gets flagged for the hostess.  You will be seated at your reservation time unlike others who made reservations by phone or through their site who still experience a wait beyond their reservation.  (Sorry to use yelp this way but time is money in Vegas!)

BTW this is the first Wolfgang Puck's restaurant that I've dined at, and the food, ambiance and service were all great and certainly did not disappoint.

To start the meal we tried to order the famous ""black chicken"" (i.e. popular Hawaiian red wine enjoyed during the prohibition period). After waiting for a while the wait staff came back to inform they went out of it. We went with some Napa red wine instead.

We shared: fried calamari (o.k.), tomato slices with fresh mozzarella and basil (very fresh), mussels with garlic bread (flavorful). The bread stick that came with two sauces (garlic balsamic vinaigrette and white bean pancetta sauce) was crunchy and very long; about twice of the length of a chopstick for good measure.

For our main course three of us ordered the slow braised short rib, which was fork tender and very flavorful; this dish alone deserves four stars. The portion size of my beef was so huge I could only finish half; but not for the two guys.  I had the sauteed kale with bacon bites and the guys had the grilled brussel sprouts as the side. I liked the kale, but can do with a little bit less salt. The guys loved the brussel sprouts. I never knew brussel sprouts can be so popular...

On the menu there are also  lots of pizzas, pastas, and other meat dishes (half chicken, grilled lamb, pork chop, filet mignon, etc.) as well as seafood (seabass, etc.) to choose from. The other lady at our table ordered the gnocchi with some sort of tomato based sauce. The portion was huge and she only finished half the plate.",f92md2NWsZTEUjI7Fr3tHw,6,4,4,fy7RJXiGKWMRBJsbbNJ4sA

i've eaten at probably a dozen of WOLFGANG PUCK's restaurants over the years and only been disappointed twice -- both times in VEGAS -- at his BAR & GRILL in the MGM GRAND and CHINOIS (CAESAR's PALACE) at the forum shops. at the first they were catering a huge after show party for KA and i think they were stretched so thin busboys were manning the kitchen. at the later i think whoever was in kitchen wasn't qualified to bus tables -- about only thing this CHINOIS shares with the one in SANTA MONICA is the name. 

big portions. nobody left hungry. service seemed more frenetic than attentive -- wait staff bustles around like chunks of ice in a microwave but avoids eye contact. it's hard to get their attention. 

loved the bread -- crusty, airy, great texture. thought the white-bean and garlic puree and olive tapenade both fell a little short. 

kid's PIZZA was a little undercooked. because the restaurant was busy, the oven stones did not fully reheat between pizzas and the bottom did not get as crispy as i like. thought the tangy goat cheese and the natural acidity of the tomato sauce made things a bit tart. 

loved the CLAMS and GUANCIALE. sauce was perfect. asked for more bread before the entrees arrived but it never showed. had to mop up with pizza crusts. 

wife, JODI, loved her PASTA but had to ask for parmesan which, with much ado, was grated tableside over her ravioli.

When the fish arrived - it was plenty big for 2 normal-sized adult human beings. Between that and the salad (which was also larger than advertised) we had no room to order dessert afterward.

Reservations at 6:30 and we arrived a half hour early from the art gallery, they took us in 15 minutes early. Reservations are very recommended, but they do serve dinner at the bar. Our waited was very friendly, and about 4 other people also assist with drink refills, and such. The bread was crunchy, but very tasteful with a white bean sauce or olive puree. The menu was good, but their specials are nice as well. My girl ended up with pork belly and pork chop. She enjoyed the belly a lot, but the chop was a little dry and there were no vegetables or potatoes to mix flavors. I went with the special of surf n turf. The fillet was very good, the red wine sauce used was one of the best tasting I have tried. The lobster was as good as the best I have had, nothing extra. My dish came with green beans, and potatoes which were both very good. All in all our experience with the food, and staff was good, nothing over the top, but very solid. 

What I wish they would change is their seating. I hate being out in the ""balcony"" where inside a casino people come right next to your table and look at your plate. They have an extensive wine list, but sadly my girl nor I indulge, and the only other thing to drink is water. Their prices are very fair for what you get at about 35 dollars a plate, however watch their specials, and get prices. The surf and turf ended up being 95 dollars which is more than anticipated with the other prices at a third of that. 

Setting was very nice and romantic if you sit inside. They don't enforce much of a dress code either which was a let down.

1. The portion size is generous. Every single dish that hits the table has more food than you would expect at a nice restaurant on The Strip. 
2. The Server Assistants are the best around. I know it is odd to note the SAs and not the actual waiters, but that is how good they are. Water never runs low. Dirty dishes are never left uncleared. And, they are eager to help you when the waiter is away. 
3. Local perks! If you're a local, you get a free dessert, and I couldn't pass it up last night. We went with the apple option, and it was worth the sugar splurge.

The rigatoni bolognese was unbelievably dry as was the spag bol. The lasagna was really good. The servers delivering bread, water top-ups etc. were great but our main server, not so much. He inquired about my half eaten dish but didn't seem too overly concerned with my opinion of it.

The food was fantastic. The concept of consistency is ever present in Wolfgang Puck's restaurants. There are never anything too crazy, but it is always solid. My friend and I decided to split a few dishes to try everything out. The buratta and proscuitto is decent. I was hoping that the outside of the cheese had more of a consistency. Instead, the whole piece had the feel of ricotta. The gnocchi in tomato sauce is splendid though. The bite sized pillows of potato flour and cheese are heavenly. The grilled octopus is melt in your mouth tender. At this point, I was full, but we keep pushing on. The pork chop and pork belly with apple compote is amazing. So is the osso bucco. Both main items are the best offerings on the menu. I was stuffed to the brim, but dessert was ordered. The cheesecake was light and I could have polished one off in state.

5381913,2011-01-04,1,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"Traveling with friends is about making a series of compromises and since I was going to get my way on our third day in Sin City, I had to be good for the other two days. Day 1 ended with dinner at Lupo by Wolfgang Puck.

I halfheartedly tried to talk my friends out of this place because based on the reviews, I expected mediocre food at best at $$$ prices. I don't mind spending money on food (au contraire, most of my discretionary income goes to eating out), but I want good food in return. Living in NY has made me very spoiled (as if I wasn't bad enough before) and the prospect of spending money on subpar food made me grouchy, but I swallowed my complaints because I knew we were all making sacrifices at one point or another for each other. 

I dislike going to celebrity restaurants where a chef owns a several restaurants because I *know* there is no way that they could possibly manage and visit each one on a regular basis. I feel that they're simply selling their name. This certainly is the case with Wolfgang Puck and with Lupo.

We received two very long breadsticks and two different kinds of dips (white bean and a black olive tapenade) for the sticks. Although I enjoyed the flavor of the white bean dip, it was way too runny as none of the dip clung to the breadstick. In order to get the flavor of the dip, I had to let the bread soak the dip, which then made the bread mushy. The dip needs to be thicker, more like a spread, rather than watery like soup.

I ordered linguine alla vongole (linguine with clams) because I love this dish in general. It was $26 ~ the typical price point I expect for an upscale restaurant. I received was a Vegas-sized platter of food. I was only expecting half as much food (indeed, even if they had only given me half, I would have thought that it was a generous serving). The food was a sad disappointment. The clams were overcooked. I would have preferred the pasta to be a little more al dente. And the sauce made from olive oil was way too runny (like the dips). The quality of the food is entirely unworthy of an upscale restaurant.

The desserts, however, were quite delightful. We ordered the 15 layer chocolate cake with gelato and the tiramisu. The 15-layer cake made of 15 very thin layers of milk chocolate and dark chocolate cake. It had a very good chocolate flavor and richness. The tiramisu wasn't quite the traditional tiramisu as there wasn't as much lady fingers and far more mousse. It was more a tiramisu mousse, but it was lovely and light. We polished off the desserts with much gusto. 

Except for the superlative desserts, I would rate the food as 2 *s. Lupo gets another star from me because of the service. Seriously, the service at Lupo was absolutely incredible and it was one of the best service experience that I've ever had. They were absolutely correct in everything (served from the left and removed from the right); water was discreetly and miraculously refilled without drawing our attention; a beautiful synchronous harmony of waiters, bussers, and runners working together to create a masterpiece of a posh elegant dining experience. Too bad the food didn't match the level of expertise and care given to us by the staff.",jqp5BEMzEUIWTCt6pezS2Q,8,5,3,XF8Vz8rriDLV01zypuT7qg

First and foremost I must recognize the excellent service. Our server Rafael was absolutely top notch. Completely knowledgeable on wines, cocktails, menu items and preparations. Extremely friendly and personable, these are the folks that are worth gold in the service industry. 

Incredible selection of apéritifs and cocktails including Barrel aged Negronis. Ample wines by the glass as well as by the bottle and half bottle. 
Bread service was excellent. Crusty sliced old world style like you'd find in the trattorias of Florence. Olive oil tempanade was outstanding. Fruity and spicy and so fresh. 

Gemberi. Seared shrimps with roasted tomatoes and chilies on a flavorful base of white bean purée. Amazing. 
Beet salad. Roasted red and gold baby beets alongside fresh burrata cheese, garnished with mint. Incredible. 
Burrata ravioli. Homemade ravioli stuffed with burrata and simmered in marinara. So light and fresh and a portion size that won't overwhelm.  

Iberico pork shoulder chargrilled, sliced, and served simply with a side of arugula. Better flavor and texture than probably any steak on the menu. Couldn't be more pleased with this dish. Again Reminiscent of a true Florentine dish. 

Topped of the meal with a shared affogato gelato and espresso served with a side of baci cookies.
I was impressed with the selection of after dinner digestifs, amari, congac, and grappa. This is truly hard to find stuff. Pick one and enjoy.

I've been to Wolfgang's express restaurant in Walt Disneyworld, but I think even that food was more appetizing then what I had in Lupo!

I don't mean to be rude, but this food was in no way what I expected. I came here with my sisters and cousin on a Saturday night, and the place was full of people, the lights were dim, the tables were white and fancy, and then... a waiter came and plopped two bread sticks in the middle of the table. Didn't even say a word. Not even a basket. Just two hard, long, and completely dry bread sticks wrapped in one napkin and placed in the middle of the table. So, my sisters and cousin and I were just wondering what to do with the sticks, and tried looking around the other tables to see if other people had eaten theirs. Many people still had their sticks.

After several minutes of confusion and eating tiny pieces of the mystery bread sticks, we finally received a REAL basket of REAL bread that came with some garlic sauce and balsamic vinegar + olive oil. That was much better, but still not as good (I thought) as the bread I had in Maggiano's. Weird.

So, we ordered our food. Let's just say, it was hardly worth the price. Here's what we ordered (I'm condensing the names because those names on the menu were in Italian and ridiculously long):

- Halibut ($31): Gah. Overcooked, or something. Definitely was more bland than I expected. The fish was placed on top of a bed of sloppily put-together tomatoes that were sauteed (I'm guessing) with onions and other things. Together, it tasted worst than something I could've done at home with the same ingredients. In fact, the sauce under the fish was watery, and way overcooked. Hardly in tact and the pesto sauce? Ah! Didn't even taste it! NOT worth $31! Look at my picture for how terrible the plating was.

- Salmon ($30): Best thing I tried. The salmon was pretty good -- I liked the extra crunch it had, but I wasn't sure if that was on purpose or if it was a bit overcooked. Tthe side potatoes were just that: side potatoes. Very salty, no herbs -- just like french fries that weren't cut into fries yet. Eh.

- Fettucini with truffles (Mushroom pasta) ($26): The fettucini was undercooked, lathered in oil and topped with salt. It was paired with truffles, but that didn't make up for the extremely unnecessary amount of oil it had. Had an odd mix of flavor that did not want me to eat any more than the few bites I had. My sisters agreed, only finishing the plate because of its expensive price.

- Shrimp risotto ($29): Perhaps the item I disliked the most. The risotto was way too creamy and buttery, and did not pair well with the shrimp. I do admit, though, the shrimps were good. But, yeah, I couldn't even eat three bites of this. Just did not like it (except for the shrimp).

I'll say this, though -- the service was pretty good. My sister blew out the candle on our table, and it was replaced instantly. We always got water refills, too. But, it was weird because a different person always came to our table. Different waiters. In fact, there were only waiters, no waitresses. Either way, I think service was decent, but the food just was not worth the $94 total plus $10 tip that we paid.

Thank God we had a 25% discount by showing them our tickets from The Lion King show! I would hate to pay full price for this!

Do not come here if you're looking for good eats (unless you greatly enjoy oil and salt)!",RPgHIlmwH0F-mlg6Ny42og,1,1,2,s2-pa35CCSmlMwTfEgBOYQ

First of all, I must say the service here is GREAT!  The servers made sure you had everything you needed.  Even though it was a busy night, the servers did not disappoint.

The food was delicious!  I really recommend the ""Scialatielli Ai Quattro Passi"" pasta.  It's a thick pasta, kinda like really fat spaghetti with a bolognese red sauce.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was tossed and combined with the pasta perfectly.  The portions was huge and was definitely sharable.

The grilled pork chop and honey glazed belly was very good also.  They usually cook the pork chop to medium, which is a little rare for my taste.  I would ask for medium well or well.  This dish could be a tad sweet with the glaze and the apple marmalade.  But overall, the flavors combine nicely with the saltiness of the chop and the sweetness of the glaze.  The chop can be a on the fatty side so beware.

The ""Salsiccia & Broccoli"" pizza was on the bland side.  The home made sausage had a mild flavor which didn't work too well with the pizza.  The Rapini/Broccoli was more bitter than I expected.  This was the only disappointment, though I'm sure the other pizzas have potential to be yummy.  

If you still have room for dessert, you must have the Tiramisu.  I usually don't like tiramisu made with lady fingers because it's usually dry.  But this was one of the better tiramisu's I've had.  It had the right amount of coffee flavor, richness from the cheese, and sweetness from the chocolate glaze.

There is a special appetizer plate that isn't even on the menu, but thanks to the Yelp photos we knew what it would look like.  Why isn't it on the menu??  It's awesome!  Olives, parmesan cheese, soprasatta, ham, and a make-your-own bruschetta with lightly grilled bread, chopped tomato & pesto mayonnaise.  I was a little disappointed at first because it seems like caprese salad is no longer on the menu, but just ask the waiter if the special appetizer is available & GET IT.  It's really good.

I got the minestrone soup & it was fine, but the highlight for me was definitely the Amatriciana pasta.  Sure, you can make pasta at home, but my pasta never came out like this!  It's slightly spicy, with *perfectly* cooked pasta & prosciutto.  If you can't decide what to get, this is a very safe choice.

The front desk hostess was very accommodating and didn't give us any grief for being a walk-in... We were seated in a matter of minutes and had a very friendly waiter explain the night's specials... The breadstick that was artistically wrapped in a napkin and arbitrarily placed on our table was kind of a weird but a welcome touch, until the real bread and olive oil/white bean dip showed up...

 order of steamed Manilla Clams with a spicy broth.. It was quite tasty and packed a spicy punch.. The portion was quite generous as 
well... So far so good until we polished off our clam appetizer and had to wait nearly 30 
minutes for our entrees, which were not quite
 worth the wait....I had the seafood risotto and my GF had the veal with asparagus and gnocchi. The risotto was very fishy and didn't
 taste quite fresh.. My GF's veal was tender, but not very tasty.. The gnocchi was just awful and poorly executed... Not good at all!!! ""What the Puck Wolfgang""...!!

5870311,2009-11-23,0,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"In early July I selected this restaurant as the venue for a corporate event. We selected the Semi Private room that was supposed to seat 75 people for the dinner. After signing the contract I was notified the the room could in fact only seat 60 people because they had recently remodeled and now the chairs were bigger. This was definitely a problem as our RSVP list was growing. They could only accommodate  a larger group with an additional room which would increase the F&B minimum. On top of that, I was told that they could not do a standing reception and a dinner in the same area even though when I spoke to the banquet director initial I indicated that I wanted a cocktail reception prior to the dinner. The whole event was turning into a big mess as the F&B was going up and up. It was very frustrating working with the banquet team. 

However, when I got on site it was totally different experience. By that time our RSVP list had grown to 80+, way more than I had expected. Although we did expect a significant drop off, we could not count on it. I ended up meeting with the banquet sales manager and she was extremely helpful in solving the space problem. She provided me with several solutions without exceeding our budget too much. I am really glad I spoke to her before the event because everything turned out great. 

The staff was extremely helpful. After dinner one of the waiters even helped me carry something back to my room. My only comment would be on the food. Trattoria Del Lupo is a Wolf Gang Puck restaurant and I expected amazingness. All I got was typical. Nothing impressive. We were however, ordering from a fixed group menu so maybe I missed something.

In all fairness, we dined around 5pm on a Monday, but it is spring break...there were two other tables filled in the whole restaurant. By the time we left around 6:30, there were about 7 tables seated with parties. Not super busy but staffed plentiful. Our waitress was Annamarie. She liked us at first but I think she hated us by the end of the meal. 

Food: we hated almost all of it. At the end of the meal, I asked my son: ""what was your favorite part of the meal?"" His response: ""the Shirley temple and the complimentary sourdough bread."" YIKES! 

What we ate and our thoughts: 

Antipasti platter ($28): meats were fresh and it was one of the best things we tried, but how do you go wrong If you serve some fresh prosciutto (it was a bit fatty but not as salty as I am used to), 4 shaved slices of fontina cheese, a few olives,  & three pieces of soppressata?!? It was a nice assortment of meats, only two cheeses and some hard toasted sourdough slices. I think $20 max is all it's worth, but oh well.

The steamed mussels ($21) in the spicy tomato sauce: it wasn't spicy at all and it had an amazing flavor...but it is NOT spicy so the name is deceptive. It's the only thing we ate that we would recommend. 

The beet salad: ($17) UGH! I presume, fresh beets with a little basalmic and some buratta cheese in the middle (it was the constituency of regurgitated cereal or oatmeal, I would say-I didn't care for it. I prefer the firmer buratta or mozzarella). I hated the salad, actually. I forced myself to eat it because beets are good for you and I didn't want to complain, but I honestly didn't care for it AT ALL.  

Frutti di mare pasta ($36): worth $12. Sparse pieces of fish in a red sauce over a generous portion of long noodles with slivers of red bell peppers. SOooOoo overpriced. 

Margherita Pizza ($17): cooked very unevenly and overlooked, I think. See picture below. The mozzarella was hard-it wasn't nice and stringy cheesy-style. It was hardened from overcooking. And I don't care if it IS a wood burning oven, none of the pieces should be burnt like this. 

Overall, I honestly can't recommend this restaurant at all because we didn't enjoy much about it. We love Areola-right across the way, also in MB. The aged humongous rib-eye that they shave off the bone right there table-side is to die for. I am Italian and I love pasta and the like, but this just wasn't good and certainly not worth the price. 

Also, it's majorly NOT kid-friendly. I would never recommend bringing the kiddos here. Nothing kids would care for, not even Alfredo sauce. The hostess recommended buttered noodles with salt and pepper. Ok, that's .33 cents for a kid's plate that they will probably charge $15. No thanks! Kids drinks are $4.50. Everything about this place just isn't for kids. If the food was good, I honestly wouldn't care about the price because we wanted a nice meal and when you want a nice meal, you expect to pay.

In a group of four women with very different palates, Italian is usually the easy choice since we all enjoy pasta and some good Italian wine. However, the pasta dishes at Lupo sounded so heavy that we instead ordered a couple of the flatbread pizzas. This turned out to be the more economical choice since they were the cheapest items on the menu and turned out to be large enough to split between two people. We did also make the mistake of ordering the bruscetta to start with but none of us could stomach the white bean paste that was the base so this appetizer went mostly uneaten.

If I were rating this place based on the food I would have to give it two stars (and that's being generous) since this neopolitan style of pizza has become so common that I can truly say that I have ""experienced better"" at nearly half a dozen places. Also, the decor was a bit boring and it is one of those restaurants that is open to the casino so you can see all the tourists walking by and have to talk over the din of the crowds which I absolutely hate. However, I am giving them an extra star due to the wonderful service we received. Our waiter was fantastic. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and graciously answered our questions without sounding condescending. I was also very impressed that he was able to recommend a wine that went perfectly with my artichoke and goat cheese flatbread (a difficult pairing, I think) and a delicious cocktail to my sister when she simply described what she was in the mood to drink without being very specific. As you can tell, we were mostly there to drink and socialize rather than eat and he let us linger at the table for almost an hour after our food arrived, continuing with the same attentive service but with absolutely no pressure to leave even though it was a full house in the middle of Saturday night dinner hour.

As for my family, they didn't get sick since they got different dishes but their food was not flavorful. 

We didn't get any bread at our table until I requested it and it arrived later after our food had arrived and we were  halfway done. 

We asked for more bread since they had given us four small slices for five people -- when the server brought us he bread he said ""this is all I have,"" without apologizing. 

No one ever came to check on our table even though there were plenty of servers standing around in the corner talking to each other... 

Overall, it was an awful experience - there are plenty of great restaurants on the strip & this one is one to avoid. 

This place did not meet the standards for the high prices they charge. The extra start is for the restaurant itself looking nice & the hostess.",kP27F2Y1Q6LQwT3xXCVXcQ,1,0,2,81cnDYQaNEM3Jom5y-pQkQ

Disappointed was the word for the evening. We ordered green salad that was over dressed-the pizza was bland and not hot and the main dish of chicken piccata was so salty that it had to be returned. The waiter presented a remake that was tough and bland. They deducted it off our bill but the experience had already taken place. Yes very disappointed that we would not go back.

The homemade, very long breadsticks with the olive tapenade was a great starter. I could have been happy with that. I had the linguini with clams and a calamari appetizer. Very, very good.

Generally, they rank from extremely reliable (bistros) to outstanding (Cut).  One problem is that WP has set the bar high.  So, what would be good Italian fare elsewhere seems a little disappointing for a restaurant with WP's name on it.  The salame plate was average, the homemade past was thick and heavy with a decent sauce, and the desserts were nothing to write home about.  WP needs to drop by and kick this place into shape.",YlL9t4Jg1D8J5iBkbcFeXg,0,0,3,2SJO9VH6obCMkEQLc2AKJw

5945575,2015-11-23,4,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"Extremely poor service from the waiter.  All other front of the restaurant staff were professional from the Hostess to the Busboy to the Food Deliverer.

Diners expect more from a restaurant when you are paying over $100 per couple.  I expect a friendly greeting from the Waiter not a ""Are you ready to order?""   With that kind of opening I asked ""Are there any specials for the day?"" knowing full well that there were none.  Gave the idiot a chance to redeem himself by giving him an opening to describe the menu.  Answer.. ""No"" and nothing else.  Strike one!

Meals completed without one visit asking how the meal was going.  Strike two!

Ordered a bottle of sparking water.  The Waiter had opportunities to fill my purposely empty glass when he walked by.  Nope..but he poured wine for the table right next to us when their glasses were empty.  Strike three!

I think Vegas must be having problems finding well trained Wait Staff..this guy would not survive in any other fine dining establishment in a big city.

As for the food, we were satisfied with the quality and presentation.  Just disappointed with the poor wait service.  Note..I should have complained but my Sig Other said not to cause a scene as we needed to head off to a late show.

5947629,2011-12-21,0,oaqbLDW3wNqkynlnp4mvlw,"Lupo is great and can be an affordable dinner option if you stick with the pizzas.  The pizzas are great for sharing, but if you are like me a love bringing food home order your own pie.

Pizzas we've has so far:

Margherita: Always a solid choice and very delicious. This was my go to entree until I tried the Patate e Pancetta.  Lupo holds the #2 spot for favorite Margherita Pizza (#1 being Settebello.)

Funghi: There are big juicy slices of portobello mushrooms on every slice.  Yum.  

Polpette di Carne: It was okay.  It tasted okay, but did not blow me away. The meatballs overpowered the taste of the pizza.  If you like meatballs, then maybe this is the pizza for you.

Patate e Pancetta: By far my favorite.  Great texture and super filling.  The potato and Gorgonzola combination is very satisfying and the pancetta breaks up the creaminess of the cheese.  

We frequent Lupo often and the service has always been great.  The staff is very attentive to your needs.  Maybe one day, I'll venture into the pastas.... if i ever get tired of the pizzas.  Maybe....",YG54z87sI6jQTjaqW14Emw,1,1,4,xqMyD7JgC0Yil0_c9QWrTg

If you can't get a table then sit at the long bar and you can order from the same menu.

Pizza options are always good to share and you can order pasta dishes as half portion as an appetizer before your main courses.

Some of the he favorite dishes: calamari, burrata, about half dozen pizza options, spaghetti with meatballs, gnocchi, bucatini, salmon, halibut, pan roasted half-chicken and the beef for two.

Then, I was told that happy hour prices were only at the bar.  What??? When my waiter arrived, he was quite apologetic, and made sure that I got my wine at the happy hour price.  It was smooth sailing from then on.  The food was great! I had the tri colored salad and chicken piccata with angel hair pasta. I was truly too full to try any of the yummy looking deserts. I was really grateful to have a waiter who turned what could have been a two star review, or worse yet...a walk-out, into a four star review!

I can say that after my meal there, I understand what all the talk is about. The dishes I ordered were flavorful and interesting without the pretense that some restaurants of this class have. 

The service was exceptional.
I was a bit difficult, having walked in with no reservations and asking for a table. They tried to seat me at the bar, but I wanted none of that. So they did their best to accommodate my need for a private table. Despite my out of the way location, my server, the manager AND one of the people who services tables came to check on me several times throughout the meal. I was not forgotten. 

I ordered their prawn starter, which exploded with flavor. You could tell that even the broth that they used as a base to their sauce was made with love as each bite had layers of flavor that came out. Garlic, seafood, herbs, the sea, acid.  It was great.  Just heavy enough for a dinner starter but light enough for the summer heat. 

I asked the server for his recommendation for my entree, expecting him to give me one of the pricier meat or fish items. Surprisingly, he recommended the mushroom ravioli - almost half the price of the most expensive dish on the menu. I took his advice and was very happy that I did. The ravioli was al dente, obviously made from scratch. The filling was rich but not sickeningly so (I tend to get overwhelmed with the richness of the stuffing in ravioli but this was just right). The ravioli was topped with fresh mushrooms - wild crimini, porcini, and another one I couldn't figure out. 

The next time I come back, I will make room for dessert. Thanks for a great experience!",60OhUP904CWpFUOWKdI1gg,1,1,4,0Iup1JCkQFGbAlquQ7KH9g
