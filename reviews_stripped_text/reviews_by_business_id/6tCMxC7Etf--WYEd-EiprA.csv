I got the taco combo which came with 3 tacos of any meat of your choice, plus beans and rice. I got the carne asada tacos with cilantro and onions and the salsa and they were great! I love tacos and I especially love trying out new places for tacos and their tacos were delicious! The lady working there was really nice as well and the service was awesome. I'd definitely come back here again and maybe try their other stuff.",ljimARMl97LDgyp531aYwQ,0,0,5,eDUfnMNOMhX1PeM0yZ0iVw

710836,2016-05-01,0,6tCMxC7Etf--WYEd-EiprA,"This is a new little spot that is off the grid. I am always rooting for the little guys so I was happy to see that this little spot opened up. 
Here we go.....
Stopped in real quick to grab a menu. It is a very small menu. Not just small meaning not a lot of choices, small in like it is physically small. No explanations on how the choices are prepared. Example: Burrito. That's it. Hurrache, never had one, just thought it was a shoe. I had to look it up online to see what it was. I like to know what I'm ordering. I went to the website ( happy to see they have one) and still no descriptions.
Decided to give it a try because I really want them to strive. People put a lot of hard work into opening a business. Word of mouth is the best way to get business.
Pros: 
They deliver! I always wondered why Mexican food places don't deliver. This is a plus.
The place is a cute little spot. 
It's clean with lots of seating.
Plenty of easy parking.
The people working were nice.
Prices are comparable.
The food has a nice presentation.
I don't want to dwell on the taste of the food cuz' it is just my opinion of preference.
My main gripe is the hot sauce (salsa). The red sauce tastes like it is a ketchup base. The green sauce had a back taste that threw me off.
The food itself wasn't bad, just needed a little more flavor that good hot sauce could help.
We ordered a flour tostada. It ended up being taco salad-like (not a complaint). More lettuce would have been great. Got it with shredded chicken. It was good. The chicken had a different kind of flavor. The beans were good.
Breakfast burrito. When I ordered it they didn't seem too sure of what came in it so they asked me what I wanted in it. Egg, cheese, potato and bacon. What bacon?? Scrambled eggs. French fries aka potatoes? Ok, I can deal with that. Seemed more like an egg and potato burrito with a pinch of bacon. Again good tasting salsa would've helped.
3 taco combo plate comes with 3 tacos(choice of meat) rice, beans and a drink (canned soda). Chose fried pork. No complaint. Decent. Good salsa would have been a good topper.
Carne Asada wet burrito. I didn't taste it, but was told that it was not something he would try again. He said it was bland. No real flavor.
Not sure if I will ever go back again. I was really hoping to like this place. I'll have to stick to my old faithful when wanting Mexican food ( which is a lot).
Again, just my opinion.
Try it. It might be a place you've been looking for.

At ur first glance you may think the prices are high and let me tell you i don't go buying high priced food anywhere an i can say this place is not expensive at all it is very much worth the money the food is absolutely delicious and you get a pretty big portion.

2428502,2016-11-12,0,6tCMxC7Etf--WYEd-EiprA,"Best mexican food Ive ever had in Las Vegas. I ordered the carne asade taco combo that came with beans, rice, gauc, three tacos and a regular sized drink. The carne asada was tender and well seasoned unlike the carne asada cooked at Roberto's or Don Tortaco. The guacamole was *fresh and the beans had great flavor. My fiance ordered carne asada fries which were amazing because they didnt taste like traditional Vegas carne asada fries. The fries didnt come with beans or guacamole. They came with cilantro and two different kinds of cheese, it reminded me of a Philly cheese stake but on fries. We were pleasantly surprised and plan to return here as soon as possible. 

pros: 
*free refills 
*food is cooked on spot and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get your food.

Never been when it was Tostadas and Tacos, but the new management and place is definitely worth 5 stars.

The staff was really friendly. The place is really clean with an A grade.

The food was really amazing and very fresh. I ordered the taco combo with carnitas. And they were some of the best I've had. My girlfriend had the same but with carne asada, and it was just as good. The combo was served with rice and beans. Also we ordered some chips and salsa. The red mild was ok. My girlfriend had a different one. Cant remember what it was exactly but it was spicier and she really enjoyed it.

Definitely give this place a shot if youre craving some tacos. Only downside is they don't offer lengua tacos!",ADcxnafmRy9MuX6lq9K65A,0,0,5,iAa57xeN1Ze787SBqAnwog
2959505,2016-06-18,0,6tCMxC7Etf--WYEd-EiprA,"Finally got to try this place after stopping by a few times when they were closed! Menu selections are similar to those at Robertos but a much smaller menu keeping it more authentic in my opinion. Food was pretty good for my first time. My kid got a wet bean, cheese, & rice burrito that she said was delicious. My boyfriend got 5 rolled chicken tacos with guac. The guac was very lemoneyy but super good and the tacos were big, puffy, & fried just right. I got a carne Asada quesadilla combo with rice and beans. I will say that the rice could use a bit more flavor but other than that, food was great. Not greasy like I imagined. Did have that home cooked touch as if it were cooked in your grandmas kitchen. Service was great. Super friendly and answered any questions that I had. My only complaint is that I didn't care for the green or red salsa, the red was a little too tomatoey in my Opinion and the green was just kind of bland... But Will try again for sure!

From the minute you walk in, you feel confident that you are going to get some good food. 
It is a super clean and friendly environment. The ordering is easy with large menus on the wall (pictures too). 
I think it was the picture on the wall of the chimichanga that sold me. I got the Asada, and when it was presented to me it looked exactly like the pic on the wall.
It tasted AMAZING!!!!!
Everything is made fresh with quality ingredients and you can taste the difference in the food here and some of the other large chain taco shops.
I am a huge fan, and will be returning very soon!

Yes, they could use a little salsa, but I added some and they really filled me up.  Beans were good (a little spicy, which I love).  Rice was just OK but I love that they add peas and carrots and corn to the rice.
