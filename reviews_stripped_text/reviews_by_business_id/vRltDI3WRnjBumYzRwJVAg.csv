Also, this place makes everything from scratch -- dough, sauce, sausage and meatballs. They even bake their own bread for the sandwiches.

They do NY Style, and really good deep dish.

I was truly shocked at how much awesome you can fit into such great value.  You can get a slice of pizza, a drink, and a salad for FIVE BUCKS!  I mean how often can five bucks get you anything anymore and yet still be enjoyable?  This place had great pizza slices that were just what you want in a walk and enjoyable place, I highly recommend getting the salad and it comes with a great serving of cheese bread.  I will return to this place again and maybe even call ahead for takeout on one of my cheat diet days.",LjDSVQGLLiOO7NCfvmV_MQ,2,2,4,OTDwMmDQHgHE66IOqTElyg
