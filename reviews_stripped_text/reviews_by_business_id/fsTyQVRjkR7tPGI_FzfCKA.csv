First, the girl taking our order at the counter showed more interest in her coworker and what he was saying (not work related), then taking our order and receiving our payment.  In fact. she gave us a view of the back of her head so she could better hear what the plans of her coworker was.  Once that part was over, we walked away to look for  table.  The tables were dirty.  We had to clean one in order to sit down  We waited and waited for our order.  When we looked over, the employees (all 3 of them)  were huddled together, one leaning on the prep counter, to talk about who knows what.  I heard several times from the girl about her ""office"" and meeting up to chat.  
We finally received our order.  The curly fries tasted like cardboard, the fried onions on our brisket sandwich were stale.  Just gross!.  I'll never go back  Ever.

As you can see in the picture the places was almost empty, stuff stacked all over the counter and signs saying they are out of lots of things like arby sauce?  we ordered four things and all were wrong.  Tried new brisket sandwich waited 15 minutes it came out cold, in a box the top of the bun was half off the sandwich there was only the equivalent of 4 pieces of meat a little dab of bbq sauce and four tiny little pieces of fried onion ring. OMG are you kidding me for almost 6$!  Not anywhere near the representation of the picture advertised I would say this is false advertisement! It was cold too!  The other sandwich was their new big brisket with belly bacon, it also was cold, it was greasy, it was very cold yukkkkkk!  Most of it went in the garbage.  We had a classic supreme medium size, they must have been short on meat because it was not more then a classic size of meat, terrible piece of lettuce leaf shoved in it, the meat was warm but the sandwich was cold.  Super disappointing for my favorite arby sandwich.  Did I say the lettuce omg it was so bad, inedible big leafy thing!  We had an order of potatoe cakes they must have been sitting someplace for 20 minutes, they were also cold, limp and uneatable.  I went to complain at the counter. nobody was there after standing there ten minutes we left.  I will not go back to this location again.  20$ spent on something not worth eating most of which we threw away.  I want my money back!",QeWsVAIDy1GPlCg14QWYsg,0,0,1,PQH-02KitTlq7zYYuGvw5Q

Unfortunately, I have to give this particular franchise 1 star. The service is achingly slow and they appear constantly understaffed and overwhelmed.

I can say different for the gyro. Disappointed. It's not the mediterranean gyro that I expected. I chose the beef (choice of beef, lamb (?) or chicken). On all the gyros I have tasted, the meat is always grilled. This one looks like it was just boiled. If you eat it by itself, it's bland. The sauce tastes just like mayonnaise. If you don't eat it right away, the 'bread' gets soggy from the sauce.
