Geo was easy to work with throughout the planning process also. He even let us know where we could taste the tacos before committing. Great customer service and great food!",nKRa_BdtGsHYzXY-BZ-9MA,0,0,5,94kv5E0aYw_7kKYXs6ruYA

He showed up early, and he was super professional and engaging with the guests at the party.  The food was very fresh, tasted amazing, and portions were plentiful.  Despite my hungry friends trying their best to eat everything Geo made, I still had food left over for about a week.

Will definitely use him again!",BfQ3oakLRQCy-sahtgIZHA,0,0,5,08-FWugkXo5YESsjFdZS_Q
1256480,2018-03-06,0,hfgcYtGziLl5bGbc89BTkQ,"Geo was catering an event we attended last week. These tacos were bomb dot com! We had 3 options to choose from: Beef, Chicken, and veggie (or you could get wild and have him serve all three on a taco). My favorite was the chicken, but all tasted great! Everyone was satisfied with the food and portions. Geo brought all the condiments which were fresh and the options were plentiful. There were three different salsa's, all which brought different levels of heat, but delicious. The food was served quickly. Geo was even accommodating to our special request of cheese taco shell (which I highly recommend). Would definitely recommend him to cater your next event!!",STxhzIJC0q_iXrNrg8vZzg,0,2,5,CiaXNcGc13lVs4zRZhXHaQ

1956803,2018-02-18,2,hfgcYtGziLl5bGbc89BTkQ,"These are, quite possibly, the best tacos in the world. As a tacophile I can honestly say that I've had a fair share of tacos in my life. The surprise I had was insurmountable when I realized that I had just eaten the best taco I have ever had in my life - and I'm an extremely picky eater.

The depth of flavor and the finish on the palette was as close to nirvana as a person can get in this world. Every single taco was made with love, and to impress; and it did!

Thank you Geo for such a wonderful gastronomical experience!",2nenJvfqRo6WSbyrcR4IAQ,0,0,5,qubYU5jOdB2Mbyb5L9Y7GA

2496681,2018-01-09,0,hfgcYtGziLl5bGbc89BTkQ,Geo made booking the event so easy and the pricing was also easy to understand. They followed up prior to the event and showed up a few minutes earlier than scheduled. I was throwing a surprise party for my wife and they didn't mind parking away so she wouldn't see the truck. Not to mention the food was so delicious! They even let us keep the leftovers. I will definitely use them again and refer them to all my friends.

He showed up early to set up, even brought materials to ensure oil did not leak on the ground (super considerate!). He was a pleasure to work with, always ensuring guests had whatever they needed and was quick to  serve food. 

We did the tacos and quesadillas, which were delicious! The condiments were fresh, and some were definitely very spicy! I would HIGHLY recommend him for events, and we're trying to figure out which event we can have next to bring him out again.",sdPU1PjCXkZz515x-JcUeg,2,2,5,syMDc6PY0m0cL7UrSKvAyw
