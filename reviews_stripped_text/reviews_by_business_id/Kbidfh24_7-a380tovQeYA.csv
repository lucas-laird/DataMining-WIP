1893065,2014-09-05,3,Kbidfh24_7-a380tovQeYA,"In an unassuming and rundown plaza, a new pupuseria popped up this summer. I put off visiting but once I finally did? Mindblown.

In addition to pupusas, they have a menu of Mexican meals with seafood and grilled meats. Pupusas are the star though, and they're great: got the queso camarones (shrimp) and queso frijoles to try (beans), and both were ample sized, well-priced, and stuffed with toppings. Salsa and slaw on the side, salsa is practically a puree but flavor is awesome- not too acidic, not to spicy, perfectly balanced. These are pupusas I'd get again, and it's rare for me to say that.

Also opted to try some stuff on the appetizer menu: there's a yucca frita dish with pork (can't remember the exact name), served with a chopped salad and more salsa. The yucca and meat were crispy, could have used a tiny bit of seasoning but I was pleased that they weren't greasy. Cut of meat (small chunks) was very fatty, but I think that is specific to the dish not an error on the part of the kitchen.

Lastly, I tried the tamale elote con crema- basically a corncake wrapped in a corn husk, made with masa flour like a tamale. This was not my kind of dish, as it had a sweetness to it and I don't like sweet corn. Not a bad dish though, and texture was good.

Pupusas are $1.50-3/ea based on toppings, and again, are of good size and are amply stuffed. Yucca app was about $8 and portion made that fair- plus it's a bit rare to find yucca in town. Tamal was maybe $2? Food easily could have been a lunch or two, total price was about $15 with tax.

Here they use what  most of the places use, big red beans. Not the same flavor but it was ok. The place doesn't have a good presentation. More ghetto style. They don't keep it up but that is ok. I came in for the food. The girl at the counter I believe she was from Colombia and the waitress Mexican which gave me a second thought. Nevertheless, food was good. They give you a good portion.

The reason why I went several times to try this place is because the food was good. But those bad smells gave me a warning signal. So I went to  different restaurants.",UCVpTNGDXFItFP5pgCdcrQ,0,0,2,99LBd8V48couiK5LleH4IQ

3451181,2017-03-22,0,Kbidfh24_7-a380tovQeYA,"We found La Bahía by referral. We were searching for nacatamales (sic) which are delicious plataño leaf wrapped tamale-like specialties emanating from Nicaragua. It's difficult to find these menu items in Clark County. One restaurant on Maryland Ave. closed and La Cosana on E. Flamingo modified its menu such that the nacatamales were apparently discontinued. In fact, kudos to that latter restaurant because they refereed us to La Bahía on W. Charleston Ave. I called La Bahía to confirm if they indeed carried the item. To my pleasure, the lady confirmed they do. She asked that I call in advance the day of the desired purchase to ensure they had them in stock. On Sunday Mar. 19, 2017 we called to order the nacatamales. When we walked in we were greeted and so we decided to try a meal there before simply buying and leaving with the nacatamales. If the nacatamales are anything like the meal we had while at the physical restaurant, then it is certain we will enjoy the nacatamales we bought and brought home frozen for a later date and an enjoyable meal. The price is very reasonable as well. Finally, the staff, especially Wendy the server was terrific & sweet. She indulged me while I practiced my Spanish and gave my spouse a few sampler beverages until she found the one desired. All-in-all, it was a great, festive and delicious experience.

3737464,2015-03-02,1,Kbidfh24_7-a380tovQeYA,"Bahía Centro America Restaurant is the place to go to get your fritanga on in Las Vegas. 

What is fritanga? I'm glad you asked... 

A fritanga (pronounced--free- tan- ga -- yes, roll that R ...) is the common name used for restaurants that make authentic home-cooked  Nicaraguan foods in an open-air/street food type of environment. The staple foods at a Nicaraguan fritanga include: Gallo Pinto (rice and beans), carne asada (grilled meat), tostones (fried sliced green plaintain), platano frito (fried ripe plaintain)/maduros (sweet plaintain), yuca, queso frito (fried cheese), and a cabbage salad. 

I was raised on fritanga on my many visits to Yambos in Miami, Florida (look it up) and on frequent trips to Nicaragua. The hubs and I hunted this little charmer down to fill up on fritanga goodness.  We ordered.....

Dine In...

(2) Fritanga de res (gallo pinto- rice and beans, sweet plantains, crispy plantain chips, fried cheese, cabbage salad, and carne asada- skirt steak) for $12.99 a pop.
 
(2) Cacaos ( a sweet chocolaty milk drink that has a more bitter taste than normal chocolate milk since they use real cacao bean shavings/powder to make it)

And To Go..

(1) Salvadoran 'quesadilla' cake (sweet dessert corn bread/ pound cake hybrid that is often found in local panaderías in El Salvador)

We were very happy with this unassuming location. Let me be clear: There are no frills to this spot and it is not '5 star' dining.  However, the food was legit, authentic, and cooked with care. The fritanga was  good and the hubs really loved the flavorful steak. I gobbled down my plantains, gallo pinto, and queso frito lickity split. Our plates were licked clean in no time. This was a true sign we would be back. We even grabbed an El Salvadorian treat to go which we will enjoy warmed up with our coffees tomorrow morning. Our server was sweet and we had a good experience.

Note- rating is focused on food and service. The location and decor is a bit underwhelming-- I still will return for the food.",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,10,5,3,3cOwBXTU0wSR9GiQ4H54dQ

I have to say these were the best pupusas in town. I've been to pupusas places that really skimp on the filling, but these were perfectly filled. The tamale de elote and platanos were also on point. Will definitely be coming back.

Like I mentioned, I didn't dine in so this review is mainly about the food. However, the woman that took my to go order was polite and helpful. She didn't seem too bothered by the fact that I didn't speak Spanish and that my pronunciation of some of the menu items was sub par. 

Also, I think they have live music during the evening because there was what looked like a small stage in the corner. I didn't get to experience that, but if you stop by for anything definitely go for pupusas.",aGsTtGmvIFYS24US0aK8LA,0,0,5,PgRPa4L5YiBRfPFa6nPENw

Unfortunately, they were out of quite a few things he wanted, but we enjoyed the dishes we did get.  Service was slow with only one waitress caring for everyone by herself, but she was very sweet.  The 2 TV's played a soccer game and a classic soap opera, which made everything feel more authentic.
