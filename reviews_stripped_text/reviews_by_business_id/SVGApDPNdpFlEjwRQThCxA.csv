- GREAT, friendly and fast service. There are always 3-4 people coming by your table and refilling water/soda/beer/chips/salsa/bean dip! They are on top of it!
- Fresh tasting food. A lot of Mexican food around town (and elsewhere for that matter) taste like it's been sitting around for hours waiting to be served. This almost always seems fresh.
- Fair prices! The prices for items and combos are great! Great happy hour too.

I recommend the rancho style tacos and (of course) the fajitas!

I hope people support this place and keep it in town. This is a hard location for businesses to prosper it seems. SUPPORT GOOD BUSINESSES!",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,3,1,5,sT3Qz_Kv6LKIXWOAwsbJLQ

The place was quite full, understandably, so we opted to be seated in the bar rather than wait. Our mistake, good meal in a noisy chaotic environment, bit of a shame, took some of the enjoyment out of it. Fortunately the food is as good as it is and made it worth while.

Ordered the Steak fajita, looks good, but doesn't taste good. Meat was tough to chew. Flour tortillas were stuck together, beans and rice regular. If your looking for ""real"" authentic Mexican food. This is not the place. Driving North a little or the Eastside can find you close to good Mexican food. Also, save you some money as Juan's can be a bit pricey. Wake up.

Chips and salsa and bean dip were all great. However 3 of a party of 6 ate the Shrimp ceviche; all three ended up with food poisoning and not only battled that miserable issue but were also forced to call out from their jobs while they recovered.

The food is always delicious no matter what you get but what really makes this place shine is the impeccable service EVERYONE gives. Love the unlimited fresh chips, salsa and beans they bring out when you sit down. You could probably get full on just those but save some room for the main course! Highly recommend the 1-3 item combination plate where you can have a choice of several items plus soup, rice and those yummy beans.

I got the shrimp ceviche appetizer. Big mistake... it was not good. It lacked flavor, and barely had any bits of shrimp but plenty of cucumber. The waitress brought my boyfriend his beer but told me they needed to change the keg for mine. That is fine but she forgot and I had to remind her twice. My boyfriend and I shared the gringo tacos. I didn't know ""gringo"" meant flavorless ground beef with lettuce and cheese. Overall not a good experience. I felt very deceived by the overwhelming amount of good reviews on this place.

Great food - I had the mulitas and my wife had the enchilada de mole.  Both just outstanding, and way too much for us to eat.  (That's what take home boxes are for!)  Our server, Hernan, must have been telepathic - whatever we needed appeared before we could ask!

125369,2016-06-06,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Very good Mexican food, I would come back again.  Let's start off with the Chips and Salsa, you get bean dip and salsa.  It was good.  They carry Tecate in the bottle and that's my favorite beer period.  They give you Fideo soup (it's a tomato based soup with angel hair pasta) as a free appetizer.

I ordered the Steak Fajitas and shared it. It was great.  I took the advice of another Yelp user.  If it's in the name, order it.  I was not disappointed.

One of my other family members ordered Carne Asada and it came out a little dry and bland.  I've had that problem before with other Mexican restaurants so it's not that big of a minus.  Ideally, Carne Asada should be cooked well done and still come out flavorful and not dried out.  

One of my kids had Chicken fingers and fries. The fries were a little over cooked. But as I usually say, you don't go to a Mexican restaurant for chicken fingers.  But like most smart Mexican restaurants, they put that on the kids menu for the kids who aren't craving Mexican food at the same time everyone else is.  I will come back again and try some of the other items on the menu.  Order the fajitas if it's your first time, you can't go wrong.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,1,0,4,hAdUd9yxSfnLEU6SFC8UFg

The fajitas are amazing - I have always loved fajitas but hubby was never a fan until we came here!  Now whenever we come here we share the most delicious steak fajitas we have ever had.  What I really love is that you can get grilled veggies instead of rice and beans.  Their pico de gallo and guacamole that comes with the fajitas is fresh and delish too.

I love the grilled jalapenos and onions that come with the delicious salsas and a basket of chips when you come in.

What gives this four instead of five stars is the chips and tortillas - they are not made in-house.  The chips can be on the stale side.  I'm also not a fan of the soup that comes with the meals but no biggie - more room for fajitas!

However the warm, friendly and attentive service more than makes up for store bought chips.  Most of the time Juan himself comes and checks on you and service has always been terrific!  We love this place!",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,2,0,4,4eXAkq-_KGaHXTD9iQT4dw

The entrees (steak fajita salad and veggie enchilada) were bland and mostly, well, whatever a good synonym for bland would be: tasteless, flavorless, dull...beige. It's basically Mexican food for people who like Mexican food but don't like all the flavor and spices and all the other stuff that makes Mexican food worth eating. At least the steak was stringy and the choice of vegetables was odd. (Who puts broccoli in fajitas?) 

I will say this in Juan's favor: True to their name, the fajitas were indeed flaming when they got to the table. But once the flames were extinguished so was our enthusiasm for the food.",yzc8WrbHJq9q2IJvGwl4mw,0,0,1,XekYHcKMIf0JWBHGDcHdJg

They brought us chips , salsa, bean dip, and a plate of chilis and onions right away and man were they good. The waiter gave us plenty of time to order and were very kind to my children by telling them good job. Our meals all came with sopa and it was delicious. They constantly brought us refills and asked us if everything was okay.

When the food came man was it delicious. It was a big helping and I couldn't even finish it. My kids enjoyed playing with the drawing pads they allowed them to play with which was a good change from the cheap coloring books and crayons they usually get from restaurants.

After the waiter Omar came over to my son and was kidding with him buy handing him the bill and saying ""what's your name?"" to which he replied.... ""Jimmy"" and Omar said ""oh jimmy I heard you have a lot of money and I was told your gonna pay the bill.""

We all had a good laugh. When he took it, he looked in and saw the money and was like ""ooooh Jimmy your rich look at all this money.""

I ended up having my son give the tip so he asked what the waiters name was and he said Omar. Then my son was like I do have a lot of money and here is your tip. We all laughed again. 

It was a very pleasant experience and you get a ton of food prepared wonderfully for a good price. I recommend going and I will for sure go back. The staff is friendly and courteous. And one of the waiters kept humming and singing Mexican songs which brought back memories. 

Hope this helped and I'm telling you....everyone in Vegas should try this place.",IWDjvGc9ZGTp97s9ys9k2w,2,1,5,gJ3fxDu3lbPY2NsAC0R8aA

Out of all the places in Las Vegas to pick for Cinco de Mayo food, drinks, and music, we picked this one based on YELP reviews.  We were first time visitors.  We will definitely return very soon!  

We arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people.  By the time we left, we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  Drinks aside, we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  We ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp.  It is more than enough for 2 people.  My hubs and I made 7 fajitas from the meat.  We can't speak to any of the other food.  OH WAIT!  Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert.  A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries.  It was DELISH!!  

We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler.  Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town.  Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   Our server was very friendly and the service was great!

The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.  They were very good!  

This is a place worth visiting!  Good food, good drinks, good prices, and good service!  Locally owned.  Flaming Fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,4,5,5,bMQPELbOG7Y1QWtd9E9U5w

Chips were good and we couldn't stop eating the salsa and bean dip.

They're famous for the Flaming Fajitas so the mixed chicken and beef were the choice.  In a word, excellent.  Big portions, all the options included (sour cream, pico, guac) along with rice and beans or veggies.

Not only was the food great but service was very attentive including refills on everything from drinks to chips and sides.  We rounded it out with the sopapillas and consensus was, this will be a repeat too.

Rolando our server was excellent. He'd visit with the kids and make them laugh.

Service:  The food was really good but the service was ridiculously slow.  We came here for my coworker's birthday so we have a large party of 11.  I understand that with a large party food sometimes take longer to come out.  However, it is not a reason to make the lunch a 3 hour event.  We looked around and saw that they were a bit understaff so we were a bit patient with waiting.  I was the only one in the group that ordered a margarita because a lot of people said they were great here.  But they managed to forget my drink, it was even harder to wave someone down to remind them.  Alas, I never got it. I'm just going to assume that it was never in the system.  With all the waiting and how long the meal was, one of my other coworker just got up and flagged down the waiter to get our check and paid the bill so we didn't have to wait for split checks. I don't even want to imagine how long that would've taken.

Conclusion: I would tell people to try this place but please only do it when you know you do not need to be somewhere after the meal just because you never know when you can leave.",2C-IiqBdp0eFtMZ3LKJIrg,2,1,3,UwRcgRY454XDsFzmF-JgGg

523937,2016-08-31,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"I was recently referred to Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina by a friend who was being continuously unimpressed by the taste of the Mexican food in the Las Vegas area.  I found this a little disconcerting being that Las Vegas was essentially a border town of the old west and as the west expanded, Las Vegas continued to maintain the southwest flavor. 

Nonetheless, it was a trusted friend, who had turned me on to some other fine establishments, so I decided to give Juan's a try and see why they were set apart from some of the other Mexican favorites in Las Vegas. 

Upon entering Juan's you see that the Cantina is set aside to the right.  As much as I enjoy a good Cantina visit, I was here for a lunch date and proceeded into the regular dinning area. Inside the dinning area, I was immediately welcomed with the laughter and good graces of a table of about ten people enjoying a birthday luncheon. 

As my friend and I were seated, we were greeted by a team looking to fill our drink order and who promptly brought chips, two salsa bowls (green and red) and beans to the table. I thought this was wonderful, so many restaurants just bring chips and salsa, but then there was more, there was a small dish of onions and sliced jalapeno peppers.  All this just to get us started.  

After looking over the menu and the waiter stopping by a couple times, just to make sure he didn't miss out on our desire to order, we made our selections.  My friend ordered the beef taquitos with veggies and I ordered the chicken fajitas with beans and rice.  

I don't know if our conversation was just that good or if the service was that prompt, but it seemed like no time at all that our food arrived.  As my friend was served her taquitos and veggies, I knew that I had missed out on a change of pace from the beans and rice, the veggies looked grilled and tasty.  

The fajitas were wonderful though, the perfect lunch portion served with three corn tortillas, the perfect amount of chicken and the right ratio of green/red peppers and onions.  All three tortillas were used and there was still a small of chicken left over to munch on.  I really didn't eat the beans and rice, not due to anything wrong with them,but mainly I was sad that I hadn't opted for the healthier veggie option.  

The chicken was tender and juicy, with the veggies grilled to the point of almost burnt, just enough to bring out the flavor and the unique flavor that is expected in a fajita dish. 

I would say that I am not sure yet that Juan's is better than any other Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, I believe I need to further explore their menu, but I would say that it is as good as some of Las Vegas' other premier Mexican restaurants. 

I would also point out that my friend and I stayed an visited for about an 45 minutes after completing our lunch without ever feeling rushed to leave.  I felt the manager and staff were very attentive to our dining needs. 

I would certainly recommend Juan's to anyone looking for a relaxing Mexican style lunch in the southwest side of Las Vegas.",p7YdXcQC8Jinl0OWsNxafA,2,0,4,be3V7yRUoTQf0e_8qK_bGQ

I've been coming to JFF (Juans Flaming Fajitas) for over 3 years now (sorry this is my first review). Before I had even visited JFF I had this image of a robertos type place and oh, was I wrong! It is very spacious, family-style restaurant and it can seat parties of 20-30 (I've been to 3). An authentic feature is that they make their own tortillas in the restaurant while you're dining. 
I have brought every family member, friend, coworker, and even my dog to JFF. Yes...you can dine with your pooch on the patio (just let them know before hand and they'll let you and your pup in the side entrance). I have never heard a complaint about the quality of the food, the presentation, or the pricing from any of the several affiliates I have introduced to the JFF family. I often get invites from people I brought to JFF asking me to join them there because they are now JFF (Juan's Frequent Flyers). 
About a month ago I was entertaining family on the strip and while chatting it up with a bartender at a well know Mexican restaurant, she actually mentioned JFF as the best place for locals!

We are very pleased we did and found our new go to place for fajitas.  We ordered beef fajitas for two.  Chips, salsa were include, along with grilled peppers and onions.  The peppers and onions were a great treat and a nice touch that I had not had in other Mexican restaurants.  Fajitas were served tableside and flaming.  Nice Touch!  We were next in fajita heaven, could not have asked for better beef fajitas, nicely cooked, great flavor, tender beef.  Everything was very good; the soup that came with the meal, beans, rice, guacamole, and salsa.  The portion is big and had extra for take home for another meal.   The service was outstanding.

They have a huge selection and lots of weekly deals such as happy hour and lunch specials. 
If you're going for lunch I would highly recommend their steak fajitas, it's delicious and a large portion size for the price. 

The service there is excellent and they are always busy still making sure each table is taken care of.

Ambiance was nice plenty of booths arrived at approximately 5:15 PM seated within Five minutes, which was a surprise due to the line. the patio area was large and numerous people were enjoying their meals seated in the patio which had misters also they have huge welcoming bar area. I ordered the shrimp fajita and my other half ordered grilled fish tacos which were incredible with home made Corn and flour tortillas. i also ordered the fajita Nachos for happy hour $6.95 which was an incredibly generous portion. Shrimp Fajitas were great not to be forgotten is the Fire presentation for the Fajitas that arrived at our table. Omar was a warm and wonderful waiter who could not have given any better service. Jose the bus-boy was extremely attentive and ensured that all of our needs were met without having to request water or napkins.Jose needs to be promoted as a server as quick as possible.

Happy hour is from 5:00 PM until 7:00 PM so worth the visit you will not be disappointed also the prices were quite reasonable for the size of the portion. Who has happy hour on Saturday? very rare! Juan's offer a happy hour which you will enjoy.

I was so excited about Juan's and our experience i almost forgot to mention the bean dip and salsa with the best grilled onions and grilled chili peppers.     

Omar and Juan thank you for a great experience and your exceptional service which is uncommon to have it all.

992560,2013-05-29,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"A few months ago, Flaming Fajitas was only a month old, we stopped in for dinner while my sister and nephew were visiting. The five of us were eager to try the newest restaurant in the neighborhood. You'd think Las Vegas of all places would have great Mexican, and while it does have a couple gems, it really has a poor showing overall. However, Flaming Fajitas has brought some heat to the scene. I mean that quite literally. 

 I love spice. And Flaming Fajitas delivers. I love the plate of grilled onions and jalapenos that gets you started and the salsa is quite tasty. This is often the weak link when I dine out, but it fresh, bold and well balanced. The staff aims to please and they were more than willing to accomodate special requests made by our group. We were started with delicious fideo soup. Then, a short bit later, hot plates piled high with food swirled around us. I ordered the tacos al pastor. However, what was presented before me was not tacos al pastor. I don't know if the kitchen made an error or if they prepare them differently but these had no lingering flavor from chilies, nor a hint of pineapple. Whatever it was, it was decent, but fajitas is the name on the building and it's what you should get here. 

My brother went with their signature Chicken Fajitas and there is quite the presentation; far more showy than any fajitas I've seen before. Usually you can hear them sizzling, but these are actually set on fire tableside. 

The fajitas are excellent. So much so, I took my husband the following night we shared the steak and chicken fajitas for two. The chicken is far better than the steak. I noticed they also offer pork. I will try that next visit. I also prefer the corn to the flour tortillas.

1024844,2018-01-21,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"I took my family ice skating around the corner from this place. Family decided this should be the place we filled our belly's with after. 
Figured with all the great reviews we would be getting some great food. 
One. Let me say that the hostess at the front is a 5 star. And the ambience in the restaurant is a 5 star. But what else I experienced there means they receive a 2 star overall. 
Our waiter wasn't the greatest. When we started ordering he kept trying to up-sell everyone to one particular dish. I don't didn't catch on to it until after he left the table and we realized that my teenage daughter ordered something he said she should take instead of what she wanted. 
When the dish came, I looked at it like ""she ain't going to eat this."" One. It was freaking massive. It was fit for 4 people. Not a 115 lb teenager. Two. I had realized that was the same dish he tried to upsell me on and that I said no to. Why the hell was he trying to up-sell us this particular dish? Was it because it was more expensive? Was it something he personally like? I don't know. But I would figure when someone says that they want something specific just let the order be done and let it be over with. There's no need to upsell.
Noticing the commotion on our table, another waitress came to the table and asked if everything was okay. I explained the situation to her and she said she would take care of everything. At that moment the other waiter came back to the table and asked if my daughter would like what she originally ordered instead. Interesting Lee, he knew exactly what the dish was and did not even have to ask her he said he would just bring it right away.
Now I'm not no food kinda connoisseur but I do love food! But I cannot under any circumstance understand what the big hype is about this place. This is not authentic! And I mean not even close! I mean all I had was tacos. And even that was not good. How do you serve a not good taco? Me and my wife and my youngest daughter ate maybe half our dishes we weren't exactly thrilled with the flavors. My oldest daughter the one who was up sold and then got the dish that she did one scarfed all her food down but I think it was more out of thinking she was satisfying me in some way rather than enjoying the food.
The rest of our evening they're followed with a thousand offerings of refills of our drinks even though we constantly said no the offers would not stop.
And oh joy, much to my delight a $75 bill 4 Non authentic food. I'm sorry but I was not impressed.
This is Las Vegas, there are way too many authentic places to get this food then to come here and pay $75 for something that did not taste good at all.
Again, this is just my experience I can't say that that is the experience of everyone and I'm sure to some their food is great... just not to me.",gKT4yKNDmo80DXtIjyYMsw,1,0,2,kiatOLvi9XHUnHTEvEQBtQ

I've found a couple of good ones, including taco shops, but I still was searching for one like back home, San Diego,  CA.
Today a co-worker texted me asking if I had plans for dinner.  When I didn't she suggested we get together and try out Juan's.  It had been highly recommended by a neighbor of her whose boyfriend is a chef.  So she figured, must be good!
And it was really good.  
I had the carne asada taco plate and the meat was cooked perfectly.   Just like back home at my one of my favorite restaurants.  While the tortillas were not made on site, they tasted close to it.
The beans and rice were just like I like them.
My friend had the fajitas and said they were also really good.
Before you order, they bring the chips out with both salsa and beans.  I had never seen beans brought before with the chips, but it worked out really good.
The service was perfect from the staff.

1141539,2016-11-22,1,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"They have the BEST Mexican food in town. Period. There's no argument or debate, the rest are terrible. I know, I've tried them all. Originally from Southern California, Mexican food is not only a staple in my life, but it's also my favorite. 

The low down: 
Viva Mercados USED to have the greatest food, but they closed. Flaming Juan jumped onboard and kept the recipes and food alive in this new location and name. Viva Mercados eventually re-opened in a new location, but the food is awful. Like seriously terrible. 

Bottom line: 
Flaming Juan (yes I realize that's not the name technically, but this is MY review lol) has done a great job at reviving an almost lost and the ONLY decent Mexican cuisine in this dust bowl of a valley. 

Favorites:
Complimentary Fideo soup, green chicken tamale, fajitas (any kind), avocado tostada, happy hour specials, and anything with carne Asada. 

The staff is usually very kind. Especially Juan (waiter, not manager), and Amanda. They're the best waiters. 

* disclaimer *
they've recently changed their bean dip and they need to change it back. It's missing something, maybe the pork it used to have, I'm not sure but that's the first sign of bad news if any.",Km9CX0_3IgYpI9Q22a2XIg,4,0,5,m54fCpFqRXdewn485xOWWA

Thank you Yelp..never would have found them without you!

Best experience in any restaurant EVER no matter the cost, country or nationality!  From the moment we walked in at 3:15 in the afternoon we were treated like long time customers (that tip very good) It was truly amazing.  The hostess girl at the front desk was so sweet and so nice and our server super nice, helpful and FAST... my only caveat is to be careful with the roasted peppers that come with the chips and salsa...Very HOT! Whew! but I recovered fast...  We arrived in time for happy hour and were happy to see red wine for $4.50 a glass and decided to do 4 different happy hour treats from the special menu.  We do this from time to time at different restaurants as we eat our dinner early so we don't go to bed with a full stomach.

When the food came we were shocked at the size of the portions! they were huge and each came with very generous portions of avocado and sour cream.  We had the fajita nachos and fajita quesadillas, shrimp cerviche and something else I don't recall.  Every thing was delicious and full of meat.  The cerviche was delicious, cool, refreshing and with lots of shrimp and avocado in it.

The red wine was tasty and everyone (including both the manager and the hostess) came by to see if everything was OK, at which time we gave them a total thumbs up!

We ended up packing up enough for us to have a light lunch in a day or two.

I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Excellent experience!",OtoCNQSiG-xHf35lUsolNw,2,1,5,vBC42Io11hRfjzIhAseicQ

That might have been because it was a long weekend but it was fine as our part of 7 got seated immediately. From the moment we walked in, the service was really friendly and excellent.

They give you bean dip, salsa, and chips to start. The chips were okay; the salsa was good but pretty spicy, and the bean dip was a nice alternative to the spiciness of the salsa. The drinks are really reasonably priced (like $5-6 for margaritas and less for beers) and looked good although I didn't order anything. The menu is pretty extensive and has a ton of options. Everything we ordered looked awesome and what I tried was really good. They light the fajitas ""on fire"" which is a nice presentation. More importantly, I tried some of my mom and brother's fajitas and they were really well seasoned and perfectly cooked. My cousin had one of the platos, shrimp with the mojo de ajo. He liked it a lot but I found it way too spicy. 

I had the enchiladas de mole. I liked my dish, but I found the mole sauce a bit disappointing. I think it had peanut butter in it did not compare to other mole sauces I have had. A bit too heavy and sweet, but it was alright with sour cream and I liked the chicken inside it a lot. 

Based solely on my dish, I would probably give this place 4 stars but I think it definitely deserves 4.5 based on the other stuff I tried, and I round up because of the service. They have a little stage so I assume they have live music from time to time and their happy hour looks good also.

1479645,2015-08-09,1,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"The tableside guacamole is the bomb! The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was lively. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. You must try the Parrillada De Mariscos.

I might have been in a review funk when I wrote my first review of this place. I thought it was strange that it had so many great reviews when I just couldn't seem to see past mediocrity.  I am glad I gave the place another try. My previous experience is leaps and bounds different from today's experience.

As soon as we stepped into the restaurant, the owner greeted us. Our server Amanda was very knowledgeable about the food. She made our guacamole at the table to our liking (e.g., jalapeños, onions, cilantro, salt, pepper, tomatoes). She also waited for us to try the guacamole to ensure we were happy, which is part of my definition of exceptional service. The chips were fresh, light, and crispy. Together this was a great beginning to our meal. 

Amanda then made some recommendations for entrées.  I love when servers take the time to make recommendations or ask if there are questions about the menu. All too often I get servers that approach the table and ask, ""Are you ready to order?"" or ""Have we decided what were going to have?"" as though they are in a rush and we are just a number. I definitely believe that good service involves finding out what your customers want - and then making recommendations that you personally know will make their experience a lasting one. 

The Parrillada De Mariscos for two was her recommendation since we both felt like seafood with a Mexican flare. This is a sizzling fajita style fish platter with scallops, white fish, shrimp, onions, and whole roasted jalapeños.  I wasn't courageous enough to bite into a whole jalapeño, but the flavor seeped into the seafood adding just that right amount of temperature and flavor to the combination of seafood. Plus, some color on top of all that sizzling yummy seafood whiteness was definitely well needed. 

The tortillas were offered in either flour or corn. We were able to watch the tortillas being made fresh in the corner of the restaurant. The restaurant also has flowers throughout in beautiful vases. 

Dessert was heavenly fried ice cream. I have had Mexican fried ice cream before at other Mexican restaurants, but this was scrumptious. The corn flakes seemed to coat the French vanilla ice cream like a puzzle. Then it was lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with whipped cream - and yes, a maraschino cherry.

I will come visit again!",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,1,2,5,CbMTJxFUVYIQGAvIqXjBzw

1513648,2017-04-24,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant. We have been going there for a few years now and have never had a bad experience.
The food is consistently good, the service is great. Staff is friendly and service is fast and friendly even when they are very busy. (and they can get VERY busy at times)
We love their flaming fajitas (shrimp and/or steak) and the fact that you can choose between rice and beans on the side, or fresh healthy veggies, which are NEVER mushy or overcooked.
Some of our favorites are the Beef Taquitos, the Table Side Guacamole, the Shrimp Ceviche and those wonderful roasted Jalapenos and onions they serve for free when you first sit down. 
Portions are big, we always end up eating too much, but food is just so good you can't help but stuff your face.
Margaritas are fantastic too.

Salsas were flavorful and the sautéed onions and chiles were delicious!  We think these were poblano and not jalapeno chiles - very good!  We had green chile and steak picado and both were very tender and yummy!  You can tell that the owners have put some thought into their menu choices and the ingredients they use.

I was recently recommended and was shocked at the good reviews and how I never heard of this place before! Came here on a Saturday night and boy, it was packed! The wait for 2 was about 20 minutes. We walked out for 10 minutes and came back. We started realizing many groups who got here after us got seated. Roughly about a total of 30 minutes I checked with the hostess and realized our name was called way long ago (when we stepped outside in the first 10 minutes of putting our name down). The hostess quickly apologized and sat us down immediately. 

The vibe is so cool, almost like you're in little Mexico! You get complimentary chips & dip, grilled peppers/onions and soup. We ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas for 2 which was way more than enough for 2 people! Everything was so fresh and delicious! Totally worth the hype.

The GF and I split a delicious chicken fajita quesadilla.  Looking forward to trying a flaming plater of meat and vegetables in the future.  Alas, a majority of lunch consisted of $3 dollar margaritas.

The service was at times a little slow, but the server would make up for it with his friendly demeanor.

1598441,2014-12-31,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"There are a ton of really high reviews here, and I love mexican food so I was excited to try this place out, but my experience doesn't reflect a similar experience. 

The chips were okay, kind of thin and tasted like some cheap supermarket chips. The salsa and beans were alright, not special but not bad at all. The non-custom standard guacamole was really good, but that was about the only thing I had that could be called really good. 

My main meal was the flautas combination plate with grilled veggies. The veggies included broccoli which was absolutely ruined. It was grilled fast on high heat, which ended up just burning and charring the florets, and that's a very bad flavor to add to broccoli. The flautas themselves were okay, not special, I just kind of ate them until I was tired of them and didn't take home any leftovers. I feel like that's almost worse than giving me bad food. At least make me have an opinion about it, right? The shell was also cooked a bit too much, so was hard to cut through.

The wife was also unhappy with her meal, I forget what exactly she got but the tortilla it was wrapped in was super soggy on the bottom and not all that pleasant to eat. 

The staff, however, was great. They were very attentive and treated us great. I'll definitely give this place a second chance for sure, if for no other reason than to try their custom guacamole option made table-side.

I want to first point out that the service here was great. Our waiter came back to see if we needed anything and even brought more then 1 bean dip and salsa for the table without us asking. Most of the time you get a tiny cup to share with a group of people but these were decent sized salsa and bean dips and requesting more was no charge. I didn't care for the salsa and it was thin. The bean dip was good and liked by our table. A cup of Fideo soup was included with the meal and it was really good. For dinner I had a 2 item combo. Chili Relleno, Cheese Enchilada and of course rice and beans. The beans were good because it was probably the same bean dip we were eating previously. The rice was dry and nasty. My plate was swimming in red sauce and some of it was soggy. The relleno wasn't great but I did enjoy the enchilada, soggy and all. This plate could have had less sauce so you could get more flavor from what was under it. My wife and a friend had fajitas and I ended up eating a couple. The meat was tough and chewy and the vegetables weren't even cooked. My wife is also in love with avocados and was not pleased with their guacamole at all. Maybe we came on an off night because this appears to be a popular place and the restaurant had plenty of customers in it.

Thanks to Terri R who made reservations days in advance. Once we told the hostess who we were they immediately took us to our table that already had  menus, place settings, plus we each had our own chips, bean dip and salsa already set on the table! I had brought some cupcakes and the host offered to store in their refrigerator as well. What nice start!

Menu featured their signature Flaming Fajitas, with choice of beef, pork,chicken or shrimp. You can do an individual order or a combo for two which included your choice of 2 meats. The latter being the better deal at $25.95. The extensive menu also included combination plates, vegetarian dishes, specialty entrees, tacos and enchiladas.

Mr. B. got an order of tacquitos for appetizers. It was an unexpectedly huge order too.  This alone could be a meal. It sure was plenty to share with our group. The complimentary bean dip was my favorite side. The beans whipped smooth and delicious!  It was quite addicting.
  
So our orders of the flaming fajitas were presented at the same time. All three were lighted simultaneously right at our table. Flames shooting a good 3 feet! You could even feel the heat! (http://instagram.com/p/jGA9r1jSB9/ ) It went out like a flash and charred the fajitas perfectly. The beef was tender, well marinated, good southwest flavor and seasoning. Grilled onions and green peppers were right texture as well. We each had our fajitas in sterno heated griddles that kept our fajitas sizzlin throughout our meal.

Service from beginning to end..MUY BIEN! Great teamwork by all staff. They were not only gracious enough to store my birthday cupcakes, little did I know my awesome friends also had a birthday cake for me which they not only stored but they provided the candles and brought out the cake lit up and sang HBD, maracas, sombrero and all!

Atmosphere was festive and family friendly. Large dining area, can accommodate large groups. The bar is in a separate section. It's also cool place to watch sports with tvs around the dining area.
 
So summing it all up:

The chips and salsa arrived, we ordered and the food came shortly after. I got the tamale and burrito combo.  The tamale came with green sauce which was pretty good.  However, the beef burrito with the red sauce was extremely salty.  It was probably the sauce which probably came out of a can that did it.  It was so salty that the next few hours I had a raised heart rate!  I am healthy that wasn't the issue.
The service was very good and polite but attendants asked one too many times how we were doing.   Another thing I thought the utensils were too cheap and fit for camping.   You would think they would have better ones.   Since they do lit the fajitas on fire next to your table, the place tends to get smoky as will your clothes.  It would have been a better experience and the rating better if only they wouldn't put a ton of salt on the food!

1721262,2013-07-02,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Finally a solid Mexican feast that can fit into my low-carb lifestyle! Skipped the chips and salsa, but ate the grilled onions and peppers that come with it! Those peppers have some heat to them. What a pleasant surprise!

Ok, so I read a few reviews that said the food is not spicy at all.  I lean toward my food extremely spicy. They happily brought out a dish of habanero sauce but gave warning to use very little, since it was extremely HOT!!! I think I was more amused as they watched the ""little lady"" (ME) douse my food in it and eat ALL of it. Love that they have the option of grilled veggies instead of rice and beans.  

I will say the carnitas was a bit dry and not the best I've had, but was fine with a bit of salsa and hot sauce mixed with all the veggies, it was more like a nice Mexican stirfry.    My husband got the ""flaming"" steak fajita, which is impressive at they brings it out a sizzling cast iron pan with a flame under it to keep it well...sizzling.  My husband enjoyed his feast of  fajitas with surprisingly flavorful rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, and  corn tortilla.  Guess what? We were pleased our food was not drowning in cheese, nor was needed or missed.  However, these servers were nice and attentive and I am sure they would have brought some cheese out if we requested.  

I am sure to be back, nice service, decent Mexican food (finally!).  The Cantina looks entertaining as it is big lined with tvs, has a full bar, and even an outdoor area,  but it was empty since it was just shy of noon on a Monday?  Luckily they also have 4 TVs in the dining area too.   The drink specials look decent, affordable, and even tasty. 

My one negative, is that I am not a fan of ""rustic"" aka cheesy Mexican decor and this place was dressed just like that...however, I focused my eyes on a 26th seed beating Serena Williams at Wimbledon.   Awesome that they had it on!",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,0,0,4,EZtoy-bnnymnZa0hbutjkA

1733991,2014-01-21,7,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Thank you, Shirley B, for choosing Juan's Flaming Fajitas for your birthday celebration. If not for you, I probably wouldn't have made it to this place. I also probably wouldn't have developed an obsession with homemade flour tortillas, either! Yes, it's that good, and I can't stop thinking about it...

Okay, concentrate Suzy. Let's write about the other awesome stuff:

Service.
The water/sodas were filled continuously throughout our meal. Endless warm chips, salsa, and delicious bean dip were replenished quickly. Too quickly! Food delivery was speedy, too. Shirley B & Terri R both brought outside desserts and the staff was more than happy to supply the candles we forgot (oops!) and present it with an enthusiastic birthday song and sombrero for the birthday girl! Awesome, friendly, and efficient staff!

Value.
I don't frequent Mexican restaurants very much, but I think it's a great deal. All entrees include unlimited chips/salsa, fideo soup, choice of vegetables or rice/beans. Our party ordered the infamous fajitas. Get the combo if you're sharing, it's definitely worth the price. Even the other items, such as the big bowl of pozole my boyfriend ordered was only $4.95. 

Food Taste:
I've had the shrimp fajitas. Big shrimps! My party loved them and Chad S loved his carne asada burrito. We've returned back a 2nd night and we ordered the Dulce De Leche Fried Ice Cream. Yum! We have to go back to try their Sopapillas, for sure!

Homemade Flour Tortillas. (Yes, it's that good)
I've been a deprived girl who hadn't been exposed to authentic tortillas very often. From now on, I'll be comparing future flour tortillas to Juan's. And yes, I know, if you're eating authentic Mexican food, you're supposed to be eating corn tortillas. But I can't help it, I love them! Served piping hot, it's so delicious that you can just eat it by itself. Or with a bit of their bean dip. It's worth the drive just for these. I'm planning my next trip there as I write this...

There's TVs to watch the game, decently clean restrooms, and has a very festive atmosphere like most good Mexican joints. Come here for your next fajita fix. But bring me back more tortillas. ;)",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,16,15,5,CUvcSSZnBg9zI1zd9b56iQ
1735872,2015-12-02,24,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Had to check this place out with such a high rating!

After a fun filled day of adventures we were starving driving back into Vegas so I went into my bookmarks and decided we were going to finally come here. I have to say this place is doing it! Lots of people waiting to be seated when we came in and when we came out. That's always a good sign!

It's crazy loud. Lots of celebrations going on everywhere and tons of tv's all around playing multiple games. I wasn't into all the tv's and it made it feel somewhat of a sports bar and the decor wasn't my favorite either as it was a tad on the commercial side. It reminded me of visiting the super touristy spots in Mexico that I didn't enjoy too much. But everything else was great.

The service is very friendly. The food was delicious & filling, especially if you're extra hungry and the best part was the older gentleman walking around singing Spanish songs with his guitar. What a nice touch! Also ~ all Yelp check-ins receive 15% off! Thanks Yelp! 

We of course had to try the fajitas and they are cooked in front of you sparking a fire that warms the entire room and I had a cheese enchilada with a hard chicken taco that were very flavorful. Everything was great and it's definitely a very fun and energetic place. Expect a possible wait time as this place is very popular.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,38,34,4,nj_RQMqLxeAkgtvB8FQieA

Interior of restaurant is nice and service is polite but painfully slow.
Complimentary chips, salsa, and beans stave off hunger, but after half an hour (and being one of few tables, early on a weekday), no one had been served. We let the staff know we would need to get our orders to go, and it still took an additional 15 minutes until we were brought our food and checks.
No one ordered anything more complicated than tacos, burritos, and a chicken breast. We were never given an explanation for the delay. 

CHILE RELLENO: overly battered but tasty, not spicy, quite cheesy.
GREEN CHILE PORK BURRITO: wrapped in a flour tortilla, dry, more like an enchilada than a burrito. Didn't care for this.
Side of GRILLED VEGGIES was an odd assortment of broccoli, cauliflower, and squash- considering this is a Mexican restaurant I kind of expected onions and peppers, maybe mushrooms and squash, so it was an odd but tasty.

Restaurant entrance has several posters with their daily specials, and they also offer a HH and MNF specials. Seems like the fajitas are the best thing to get here, given the name and the fiery presentation.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,12,3,Pbopp9H1gVBEatCXxvvexw

With my favorite Mexican restaurant closed and only mediocre experiences at others in the area, I turned to Yelp to see what was new. 

Juan's was sort of on the way to the Orleans Arena, so I talked Mom into stopping there for lunch on the way to the Wranglers game. We parked right out front and headed in. Mom immediately noticed a giant jar of peppermints--a sure sign of a restaurant that cares about its patrons. We were seated promptly in a booth (always my favorite) and delivered chips, salsa and bean dip. YUM. Shortly after, complimentary vegetable soup with a tomato base. TWO YUMS. 

As far as options go, there's something for everyone. Several vegetarian dishes were offered. Mom picked the tamale and I ordered the enchiladas, which came with your standard delicious rice and refried beans. It all seemed pretty healthy, my enchiladas stuffed with zucchini, broccoli and bell peppers--unusual fillings, but I liked the mix. 

Everything was clean, including the bathrooms, and large screen TVs were scattered throughout the dining area featuring sporting events. The manager (owner?) stopped by our table for a chat and gave us the history of the restaurant and the building (formerly a BBQ place--my father would be crushed.) 

Service? Super important to me, and spot on. All in all, an excellent experience. Can't wait to go back!!

Edit: totally forgot about the onion/green pepper relish. SO GOOD. I don't usually like onions, but I ate as many as I could stuff in my mouth. They also appear to have wifi for guests, but I don't know how to get the password.",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,6,3,5,SGgFRMSLehdeNNiJp432Tw

I have never felt like ""VIP"" at a local restaurant but as soon as we sit at his table he treats us like we are family friends.

We recommend the table side guacamole (extra spicy) or shrimp ceviche for apps.  They also serve sautéed peppers and onions with their complimentary chips and salsa. 
For main course the list goes on and on!  You can never go wrong with the fajitas of course, chicken and shrimp combo is our go to. 
The Guadalajara special is a MUST! We get this more often than the fajitas.... it's perfect to share after a basket of chips, salsa, & guac! 
The parrillada, carne asada a la tampiqueña, marisco adobados, and the parrillada de marisco are all delicious choices!!

I've been here I think 3-4 times so far, and I've tried the Fajitas and enchiladas, both were as good as any place I have ever eaten.  One of the things that I really like about this place is the chips n salsa they serve as appetizers.  The chips come with usually 3 or more types of salsa which are all very good, as well as comes with bean dip which is also very very good.  The atmosphere here is really nice.  They will often (usually at dinner hours) have a man playing Mexican guitar music while walking around the dinning area which is nice.  I have also been extremely amazed at how quickly the food arrives.  Normally with any Mexican restaurants, my family is able to go through 3-4 baskets of chips before our main course arrives, but here we are getting our food right around the time we finished the first basket.  Now this may depend on how busy they are, but so far I have never experienced a long wait for the food.  I will say the one downfall I experienced (which really isn't a negative on their part), is that we had to wait a long time to get seated due to them being so busy on one occasion.  This was around the dinner rush time on a weekend, so the line was all the way outside, but still it was worth the wait and I can understand why so many wanted to eat there.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,0,0,5,Q8mvz-diy_PXYADfYdfuig

Many of the items that came to the table were not made in house. The chips were not fresh, some store bought variety. The salsa, despite many other reviews, was not fresh and pretty spicy. The margarita was the worst margarita I have ever purchased. The mix they use is super sweet and just plain terrible (and probably old). I tasted very little tequila and even less lime, odd for a drink that consists mainly of those two ingredients. It was so sweet  that my girlfriend couldn't even drink it (and this went completely unnoticed). 

I ordered some of their ""Flamin' Fajitas,"" and was not impressed. It reminded me of something you could find at Chili's. The flame they give you at the table, while fun to watch, is terrible to taste. The protein was cooked beyond well done- chicken being super dry and steak being very tough. 

I will say the service was pretty good.   The manager did notice our apparent dissatisfaction with the food, but at that point we knew we were not coming back and did not even bother explaining everything we found wrong with our visit.  

Overall, it was not the worst meal I've ever eaten, but our experience was no where near five stars. 

And on an unrelated note about Juan's, the font on their menu is horrendous. It is childish and ugly, I think they should change it. However I will not be returning to check.",M_kGB4i9xBVU1RejkmD0zQ,3,0,2,HNjadCHSsutrAcz_x5US_A

We came here on a Saturday around lunch time. There was a wait for seating, with a few customers ahead of us. So we opted for a table at the bar where we were promptly seated. 

The server quickly came to take our drink order, which consisted of a water and a small house margarita on the rocks. The margarita came out quickly. Overall, the service throughout our meal was swift & friendly. 

Complimentary chips with 2 types of salsa (red and green) and beans quickly followed. I enjoyed the red salsa. They also serve complimentary grilled jalapeños and onions. Awesome!  They were a bit salty, but I like it nonetheless. 

We ordered the chile Colorado and the flaming chicken fajitas. Both came with sope de fideo soup (noodle soup). The noodles were thick like spaghetti and there were small bits of tomato. It was okay - not my favorite version of the soup. 

The chile Colorado was okay, nothing outstanding. The flaming chicken fajitas were set aflame table side-this is what sets this Mexican restaurant apart from its fellow competitors. When I order fajitas I like 2 things 1) flavor to the meat and 2) a selection of veggies. Most fajitas have bland meat, requiring me to lime down my fajitas. These fajitas weren't bland, which I was happy about. They came with red & green peppers and onions. Not overly zealous on the veggies, but I like when I get red bell peppers so yay! for this.

We got there a little before 7pm and were able to order off the happy hour menu. We got the queso, which was good but more cheese than 2 people should eat in one sitting.

For my entree, I got the 2-item combo (I love a combo!) with chile rellano and chicken enchilada. I enjoyed both, especially because the chile rellano wasn't heavily coated with batter. Came with soup, which I liked so much I also had the hubby's portion. For dessert, we ordered the fried ice cream which I liked. Ice cream is a combination of 3 flavors (I think caramel, vanilla and chocolate?) and was still very cold inside the deep fried batter, but the batter was chewier than I expected.

My overall experience was good. The only thing that dampened it was there was a large projection screen in the bar, which was showing the hockey game and the table next to us was overly loud and obnoxious with their hockey commentary.

Don't be discouraged if you see a huge line though as it tends to move pretty quick. There's been a few times where the hosts told me it'll be a 30 min wait but in actuality it'll be closer to 10 min. 

You get complimentary chips and three different dips. I can seriously finish a whole basket of their chips because they're that good! For entrees, I usually get the steak fajitas protein style with romaine leaves (instead of tortilla) and side of steamed veggies (instead of rice and beans). Gotta balance it out after eating gorging on those chips. 

Servers are always friendly and there's never been a long wait for the food to arrive. The bus persons are quick with clearing your dishes and making sure you have everything you need.

The chips came out warm accompanied with salsa that had just the right amount of spice and a bean dip that reminded me of my long lost favorite Margaritas Cantina (at the old frontier casino), so of course that alone will bring me back! 

We ordered the fajitas for two people for $25 (a steal in my book) and there was more than enough meat and veggies! The meat is so tender and flavorful that I didn't really even need all the fixings.

2029914,2018-01-27,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"3.75 stars. 

Because of past experiences with other large party-friendly, expansive ""Mexican"" menu, margarita-obsessed restaurants (*cough* El Torito, Acapulco *cough*), I almost dreaded having dinner there. 

I expected watered down, over-saccharine drinks, bland meat, weak salsas, and to eat my weight in tortilla chips.

What we got were surprisingly good margaritas (even the happy hour one I ordered for the first round, nicely charred sizzling meat and juicy shrimp, and a trio of dips to include two tasty salsas and a dip bean that ensured I would still eat my weight in tortilla chips. 

Let's back up to the margaritas. Happy Hour margaritas are usually 99% margarita mix and have no strength. They're also usually some ridiculous price like $2. The HH drinks here come in at around $6 on average, but actually have some body to them. I was surprised to find that even the flavored selections didn't wuss out. That said, on round two, I opted for a full-priced spicy watermelon margarita. It was an extra $2 well spent. 

The food exceeded my expectations. A first timer should definitely order the flaming fajitas. Aside from the name of the place practically telling you to, you should do this if for nothing else than the sheer spectacle that is the meat arriving on a round custom ""JFFC"" grill. Said grill is then set on fire causing an eruption of flames at such heights that I wonder how many servers have lost their eyebrows as part of regular dinner service. Come on, man. It's in the name. 

My husband and I ordered the combo fajitas for two and opted for steak and shrimp. Oh, yeah. If you have an eating partner, are a greedy face, or like to eat dinner leftovers by yourself for a few meals after, get the combo. It just looks cool. Bigger is better, right (yay, 'Murica?). 

My only squabbles on the food would be that the number of shrimp provided and the sides. The portion of shrimp provided for maybe 2.5 per fajita if you used 3 tortillas for the meal. As for the sides, if you're going to the tex-mex, gringo-leaning menu, then cover the beans in cheese. Smother those things. Yeah, yeah. I know I'm Asian and well on my way to lactose-intolerance, but I love my cheese-covered beans. 

Aside from that, service was just okay. I didn't get the impression that our server cared much for us, but perhaps it was because it was a Thursday and he was as over the week as the rest of us. He gets a pass. 

Based on the scene when I arrived, I would suggest making reservations. When we arrived at about 5:15pm, the lobby area was packed and wait times were at around 25 minutes. Luckily for me, this experienced was skipped thanks to folks from our party having arrived early to snag a table.

Anyway, does this place suck? No. Is it like the El Toritos and Acapulcos of the world? It's a better, upgraded version. Is it the best Mexican food in Vegas? Not by a long shot. 

But I'm not mad at it.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,3,0,4,u4o1k6QJbfkrOG-rBy_QMw

This is some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. It beats Lindo Michoacan, Benito Michoacan, and even Border Grill in my book. Factor in the price and it's a triple threat. 

I'm pretty sure this restaurant truly has some of the best fajitas in the valley. The meat they use is very high quality, their produce is fresh, and everything is spiced to perfection. It also doesn't hurt that you get a show with the meal when you order the fajitas. 

Their chips and salsa are awesome, served with salsa, refried beans and grilled peppers and onions. Because the wait staff is on fire (badum ching) they keep them refilled too. 

The only thing that keeps this place from being five stars for me is their chile verde. It's good, but not great. The pork has been a little bit fatty at times and the flavor could be a titch more complex. I know its the base for verde, but I like my chile verde to taste like more than just tomatillos. It's still good though.

When the fajitas came.... FIREEEE! They put on a cool fire show with your fajitas and it's comes so hot and sizzling! The one person fajita was more than enough for me and my girlfriend. The rolled tacos were okay and kinda greasy. 

Actually will come back for more fajitas!",w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg,4,2,4,k6_gT0NAzLsgGnl-LHpuzw

You feel welcomed the second you walk through the door. The outdoor patio is fantastic to hang out in during the cool and warm months. Be careful because the second you sit down food is being delivered. 

Before ordering, Juan's gives you a delicious basket of chips, salsas, fried peppers, onions and a killer bowl of Mexican soup. Try not to stuff your face with them because the items on the menu are deeeeeeelightful. 

I have been here a few times and ate burritos and tacos, which are amazing, but the last time visited I ordered the flaming fajitas. Can you say NOM? I can!

The meal was lit on fire at our table just before serving which makes the dish really fun. It tasted wonderful too. 

Throughout my meal I was happy to see little flaming flashes out of the corner of my eye of others who ordered their fajitas. It's like a flaming party up in there!

Juan's has a fun happy hour too. The drinks are great, the service is great and who doesn't like their food lit on fire? I know I do!

The Bar has video slot machines which were Tight with a capital T and even though I sadly kept loosing money, I still was happily consuming tasty drinks and Chips and Salsa at happy hour prices.

The House Margarita tasted (Tony the Tiger) GRRRREight, so was the Modelo Dark Draft served in a large chilled glass with a lime slice that I swilled down with great lewd gusto.

The Chips and Bean dip was decent, but what really shined was the red and green Salsas. The best I think I've had in Las Vegas since being a San Diego transplant many years ago...so I ate all that was put in front of me and even asked for some to go.

I ordered a large Albondigas soup to go as well with all the trimmings which are generally sliced Limes, Spanish Rice, chopped onions and Cilantro and crushed red pepper, all Muy importante preparaciones for an anticipated hangover the next day. Si Si Senor!

What I actually got, I discovered to my dismay after Greedily opening the bag while hungover the next day and looking for my cure...was a large Fideo Soup instead and more Bean dip rather than Spanish Rice ///sigh x@#&%!! at least the chopped Onions and Cilantro and limes were there, but Sheesh!

Need say more its all in the name of the restaurant. I never ordered the Flaming Fajitas. I felt like constant bonfires going off every five mins looking around the restaurant. So really hard not too order the star or show stopper but thankfully bunch of us so got too watch the show up close. I heard about looked and smelled great everyone said that it was really good. 

What I did order was the Carne Asada Burrito. I loved it! The portion size is huge. I know its mexican restaurant so that really should not come as shocker. I felt like you got nice portion of rice and beans. Not only the size but everything on the plate had great flavors and really really good. The Carne Asada meat by itself was fabulous! The thing was the burrito was packed with meat more meat and went with the red not green chili.  The meat was nice, moist, well seasoned, and use base carne asada any style taco, burrito, or whatever be in Carne Asada heaven. The rice and refried beans had nice flavor. Sometimes go mexican restaurant taste very bland or feel like out of can. I felt like both sides freshly made each day. The guacamole was nice. 

The chips and salsa start up with highly ADDICTING. The chips were nice, Hot, fresh and crispy. The salsa too the warm bean dip. Be warned might want too take it easy on the chips before your meal. No room for entree.

The service was awesome. We brought in two different desserts from outside businesses. They still more then happy too keep them refrigerated in the back until we finish with dinner. Missing candles they found two candles for us. The whole they never raised stink eye about us bringing outside stuff. The staff guess birthday they sing happy birthday and the birthday person gets too wear sambrero. We slowly but in time we all showed. I felt like they never rushed us too turn over our big table. Never empty glass of beverage or chips on our table the whole night. They more then happy too split our checks. Talk about reasonable family friendly prices.

I had the chicken taco and chicken enchilada. They were certainly adequate but not extraordinary. My sister had a ground beef taco and her feeling was the same. I thought the sauce lacked a kick and anything that might make it really stand out. 

The decor was pretty much standard and the place was a little loud. 

I will say that the service was good. There was a line waiting and I was with old friends catching up. I thought the fact that we had overstayed our welcome was well-handled.

One might think, ""Hmm fajitas - doesn't that usually mean dry chicken and stiff steak?""
(at least that's what I thought) but I've been proven wrong time and time again at Juan's. Juan's fajitas are the benchmark of fajitas. It's almost as if the meats/proteins come out slightly rare on purpose, knowing that they will be the perfect temperature in about 30 flaming seconds, or the time in which it takes to assemble your first fajita and nab a first bite.

If you like fajitas, you will LOVE this place.
If you don't like fajitas, try Juan's and you will understand why fajitas exist.

2302949,2016-11-17,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"I have to start with the fact our waiter was in some mood the day we went. Our service was not ideal, our drinks were rarely refilled, and he just, in general, was not nice. However, even though I was seriously underwhelmed by the service I didn't take any stars off for that - everyone has a bad day! We sat down 30 minutes before happy hour ended, and he would not give us happy hour pricing. So I guess my advice would be to finish your meal before happy hour ends! 

So, without considering the service, this place is three stars. The food is alright. On the sampler platter, my quesadilla was underwhelming, to say the least. It wasn't toasted on the outside, which is how I prefer them, but even adjusting for that the cheese might as well have been from a can. The chips that came alongside it with refried beans were better, but the taquitos were basically flavorless. Shrimp cocktail is usually the saving grace of any Mexican eatery for me, and this was my least favorite in Vegas. It wasn't bad, I still ate it, but it wasn't good. If it was my first time having a shrimp cocktail in this style, I probably wouldn't have bothered to try it again. 

If a friend wanted to try this place, I'd go back, but I wouldn't choose it on my own.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,6,5,3,lPrq7s19LbWvlcJ9K-j1cQ

2311800,2015-05-17,1,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Trying to figure out exactly how, and why, this place is so highly reviewed. Honestly, it feels like a Mexican version of Claim Jumper. Portions are too large for an average-sized diner; hence, both my date and I felt guilty for leaving such large portions on the plate.

I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were sub-par. It's never a good sign when a restaurant uses baby shrimp in their dishes. This means the shrimp is either frozen or purchased cheaply in bulk. Not a lot of flavor in the shrimp but the sauce was pretty good.

My date had the taco salad with chicken and claimed it was okay. Like other reviewers stated, there's nothing necessarily ""bad"" about the food it just seems like your run-of-the-mill place. Nothing remarkable. That said, by the time I finished one taco my date's tostada was getting quite soggy. It was kind of gross.

So, I can't imagine returning unless it's for happy hour when a mariachi band is playing.",tmBG-7YrsbXTTZECLHSDtA,3,0,3,hOhmYbLgtIf3nQNF0SPl5g
2318840,2013-11-13,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"THIS place has shot straight to the number one position in my ""best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas"" list.  There are a number of reasons as to why I think Juan's is #1 but for the most part: the food is fresh, cooked perfectly, unique, and consistently delicious; the service is probably the best I have experienced at a Mexican restaurant; their alcoholic beverages are nice and stiff (unlike most watered-down drinks at similar restaurants); the decor is actually really nice and comforting with great booths and TVs strategically placed around the whole restaurant; and, last but not least - the waiters and staff are AMAZING. 

Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to our table within seconds of being seated. I really, really enjoyed the flavor and spice level of the salsa - it was unique, tasty, and definitely did not come from a jar.  The bean dip was great too. 

I ordered fish tacos my girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas en Tomatillo after our waiter highly recommended she try it.  

Before our food came, our waiter brought out some complimentary soup.  I'm pretty sure it was pizole or fideo, but I could be wrong. Either way, it tasted amazing and I actually finished the whole bowl. I never like the soup at Mexican restaurants, but the broth was so flavorful I found myself slurping up the entire bowl. 

My fish tacos were pretty good - the fish was crispy and flaky without that soggy-ness that often comes when you do not eat the fish fast enough. I enjoyed them (although they are no Phranks!).  The REAL winner were the enchiladas. Ohmygod I have never tasted enchiladas so delicious, creamy and unique. They had onions and white sauce and cilantro and chicken and cheese and it took everything in me not to finish the rest of my girlfriend's meal when she left the table to use the restroom. I highly recommend this dish. 

I will be back ASAP to try the flaming fajitas. The table next to us ordered some and all I could hear during the remainder of our meal were variations of ""mmmm, ohmygod, did you try this? damn this is good.""  

Also, we ordered a couple of Coronaritas, which were made with top shelf tequila,  and they were cheap AND fantastic. 

I wish I lived closer because Juan's has a great happy hour and Mexican restaurants never have great food AND great service.  Juan's definitely gives all other Vegas Mexican restaurants in this price range something to be scared of ... because they all need to step up their game.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,6,2,5,nj7iqG9rFNmxUtZTLBslWQ

I understand that this is the same general staff from Viva Mercados (rip) , that is why Ihave given this place many tries now.  The food is very very bland.  Meat has no seasonings or so it seems.  They put on a go show for the  fajitas, but the fajitas are barely average.    Mole sauce is better then some in town, but it still tastes out of a jar.  Tamales are sub-par, tacos...well who can f-up taco, their tacos were good.  Chili verde was aweful but not great.   I could go on and on.

However, they immediately offered to put more avocados in it to balance out if we wanted.  The fajitas themselves are great.

Plenty of parking, short wait for the rest of our group to arrive so I had a mango margarita at the bar. We were seated immediately when our party arrived and the parade of deliciousness started arriving starting with the chips, salsa, and received beans. I'm not sure if some in our party requested grilled onions and jalapeños with the chips and salsa or if it's a regular thing that comes with, but do yourself a favor and order it! We also got the table side guac which was great. The highlight, obviously are the fajitas! Tip: if you're getting an appetizer, soup, or multiple baskets of chips and salsa, order the fajitas for one. It comes in a Dutch oven type pot with a burner underneath and they literally light the thing on fire before placing on the table(fire out before hitting the table but burner underneath still lit, so watch little hands).

It was my mid-week birthday dinner and we felt like we wanted to try somewhere new - so I turned to my fellow Yelpers.  Mexican is one of my favorite cuisines (along with everything else it seems) and when I read all of the stellar reviews - I knew I had to try Juan's.

We arrived in time for Happy Hour which let us try two different types of margaritas at a super reasonable price, the house and the Don Julio.  I found the mix a bit lacking in depth of flavor and thought that the house margarita might be watered down - but one sip into my second, and I realized these babies pack a punch! (Also evidenced by the pitcher-sharing table of seniors next to us who were getting into increasingly loud, contentious political conversations in the table next to us. Apparently I'm not the only person that gets sassy on tequila!).

The gratis tortillas chips were fresh and crisp - the salsa and complimentary bean dip tasty!  (Note that their regular bean dip isn't vegetarian - but you can request a veggie version! Love that!) The complimentary plate of grilled peppers and onions was delish as well.

We ordered the shrimp fajitas for two - with two different set-ups - rice & beans, steamed veggies, flour tortillas as well as corn. The best of all worlds and a great way to try a lot of different items on the menu for first-time visitors. When I missed taking a shot of the flaming of the fajitas - our waiter flamed them a second time for me - nice of him!  They don't skimp on the shrimp like some restaurants that serve fajitas in town - here they made up the majority of the meal and were good quality - nice and plump and perfectly cooked. I have to say, the side of veggies was really great - I don't know what they do to it, but it has some really great subtle additional flavorings in there.

I had jokingly mentioned that it was my birthday at some point, and the staff surprised us with churros with chocolate sauce and whipped cream - served up with a hearty version of ""Happy Birthday"" and a paper tiara with a sombrero on it at the end of our meal.  Awesome touch, you guys!  

Overall, had a great time.  The service was great and friendly, the food terrific, the prices super reasonable during happy hour. We'll definitely be back!",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,5,2,5,6uRhAw7EJwr3vtmb2ye4Yg

The wait ended up being only 20 minutes or so and inside we went. We were brought chips and salsa fairly quickly and within 5 minutes of sitting down, we ordered our drinks. I ordered a Mai Tai and it was amazing. It was strong and tasty and not expensive. Then a few minutes later, the waiter returned to take our orders.

I also asked for a side of cheese which is an extra $1.50 but holy mountain of cheese Batman! They do not skimp you on anything. Now, the food. No lie- THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS I'VE EVER HAD! Ever! The flavor was on point. There was no one seasoning that overpowered another. The portion sizes were good as well and the food that I took home for leftovers was devoured the next day and let me tell you, it tasted just as good reheated as it did the night before. As we finished up, we noticed it was close to closing time, but no one rushed us. We were able to enjoy our food and take our time. When we got our bills, I was so impressed by the total! It was less than $40 for both of us. For good drinks and great food? That's unheard of! I will be singing Juan's praises to everyone, because it was that good and I look forward to returning as soon as I can!",UAkH7Y9oc3pUN7_CXe0BSg,0,0,5,RanPHtqNhhnV84nxw7oxjw

Two kinds of salsa and a bean dip come with chips when you sit down, as well as grilled onions and jalapeños. All of which were very good and a nice touch compared with most other mexican restaurants.

Ordered the civiche as an appetizer which was very fresh.  The main course combination platter of a Chile Rellano and chicken flauta was very good.  The star of the show were the steak fajitas.  Outstanding taste and the steak was perfectly marinated and cooked.  Flour tortillas were obviously made in house.

2508537,2014-01-12,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Had heard and read a lot of great things about the eatery - and since our family is a big fan of Mexican food, we were eager to give it a try. 

Didn't have to wait long for a table, despite the fact that the waiting area was crowded. Once seated, chips, salsa, bean dip and a (kind of weird - what do you do with this??) plate of grilled onions and jalapenos were promptly delivered to the table. Our drink orders were also taken. Then, the ""chip guy"" inquired whether we'd like more bean dip, and quickly brought over an additional four bowls. Seemed a bit like overkill, but OK. 

But then, nothing ... for about eight minutes. No one came to take orders. Our waiter noticed (finally) that we were ready to order, but said he'd be back in a moment. We ordered chicken tacos off the combination menu, a kids' enchilada and chicken asado tacos. All came with bowls of fideo soup, which was on the bland side (and mine was hardly warm). 

We also ordered the queso fundito appetizer. Don't bother: It's a lump of melted cheddar (not in a good way, but a stringy, difficult to eat way) with a few tomatoes and onions mixed in. Thank goodness it was discounted for happy hour (as was the strawberry margarita we ordered - good price, but nothing to write home about) or I would have been REALLY disappointed. 

Overall, the quality of the entrees was just OK - much better than the salsa/beans and queso, thankfully. I just wasn't as blown away by the flavor as I'd expected to be based on all of the terrific things I'd heard. The food was pretty run-of-the-mill. The service from everyone (with the exception of the the chip guy, who was top-notch) was spotty throughout. 

Will we return for another meal? My spouse answered that best: ""If Lindo Michoacan is ever REALLY busy, this place could be an acceptable Plan B. But Lindo's never THAT busy"" - in other words, we likely won't be back.",ETm310CbrUN9MJ5is7_gaQ,1,0,2,yGY0JAImKZz2nA19DqS1cQ

Ordered a margarita and unfortunately it was very weak and probably the worst one I've ever had. Barely tasted like alcohol at all but hey maybe I've just been getting some good margaritas EVERYWHERE else I go (including some pretty crappy chains).

Chips, salsa, beans, and jalapenos/onions to start. Great! The salsa had a nice spice to it. The jalapenos and onions were a pleasant surprise and tasted wonderful. I don't like beans but for some reason I liked these and ate more of them than anything else.

For mains I ordered a steak/shrimp fajita combo. Worst thing about it, WAY TOO MUCH FOOD! I guess that's not a bad thing but I did feel bad for how much I left. Every piece of it from the meat to sides were very good. The tortillas ended up getting very dried out since they were just brought out wrapped in some paper. This is something that should be figured out since it does take a while to work through the tortillas.

We did really enjoy the chips, salsa, and onion chile slices however we did not receive amazing service like most if the reviews. They took ten minutes to get our waters and soft drinks, and the pina colada my dad ordered was pretty much ice chunks and milk.

Happy Hour specials are beer, wine and margaritas for under $4-$5.  Apps range from $5-$10.  

Sat on the patio which was really nice.  Started with Peach and Mango Margaritas.  For food we ordered the JFFC's Nachos, Queso Fundido and Shredded Beef Taquitos.  Food and drinks were great.  By the time we left we tried all 5 of the flavored margaritas and loved each one.  Can't beat the price of just over $5 (+.55 for flavored).  Service wasn't the best.

2628886,2016-03-10,4,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Holy crap! like the name of the place says thier fajitas are flaming! Located close to Tropicana and Fort Apache in the same center as In n out burger. When you come in you can go right which is a bigger dining area or go left which is their bar area which also has ample seating. 

They got TV's by the bar area so you can watch your sports (golf was on...?) this area is pretty tight so impossible to get bad service in my opinion because staff is always walking by you, they really can't miss you.  

You start out with noodle soup which I enjoyed, wasn't spicy. I ordered the steak ranchero, basically a steak with melted cheese on top. Comes with rice and refried beans. I enjoyed my meal but was thinking maybe I should have ordered the Fajita. Ellen F. ordered it and this guy rolls it out on a cart and whoosh! sets it aflame. 

Wifey ordered it for one and aside from eating my steak I was able to pick at it as it was more than enough, they also have an option for two. We ordered margaritas and we're with my parents, they had booze to and some extra sides. All in all with Steak a Fajita for 1 and Fajita for 2, booze for four people it came out to about $81 with the 15% check-in coupon from Yelp. 

Word of advice if your going to a place with the words flaming Fajita in its name, have the Fajita. As you want regret it, next time I'll try the shrimp Fajita.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,9,6,4,0JY-FRUIXnyb6PzG8CzXww

Had a carne asada burrito with green sauce from the one item dinner and two margaritas during happy hour. Everything was really decently priced and margaritas are a steal during happy hour. They give you chips, salsa, beans, grilled onions and jalapeños (and soup with your entree) before your actual meal so before you know it you've eaten your weight in chips and when your actual food comes out you're on the struggle boat trying to finish. All good though. I finished. Came at a cost but had to do it. 

Btw, you come out of the restaurant smelling like their flamin' fajitas so make sure you've invited everyone you needed to because people will definitely know you were there and will be bummed if you ""forgot"" to invite them.",exrhmN7te3DWgay2m6fZBw,0,1,5,nG4-eoXGUk7wtXfiIL3G_w

Check your credit card statement with your receipt!  I went there for the first time a few days ago and gave a generous tip of 30 percent. I checked my credit card statement and noticed the restaurant charged an extra $22 in addition to my bill plus tip! I called three times and explained what happened. I was told the owner was the only one who can help me out so I left 3 messages. I was told the owner would call today but when I waited all day and didn't receive a call, I called again and was told the owner left for the day.

They started us off with chips, beans and salsa. Their green salsa is really good.  And they give you a plate of sautaide jalapeños and onions. We ordered a lovelady to drink.  We ordered the chicken fingers and fries for my daughter. My boyfriend asked the server if they had carnitas as an option for a chimichanga ( it's not an option on the menu) and she said yes, so he ordered that with rice and beans. I ordered chicken mulitas. They start you off with video soup. 
 The beer was good. Served in an iced glass. The kids tenders and fries were great. My mulitas were really good, but they're hard to eat. It gets a bit messy. My boyfriend took a couple bites but didn't like his chimichanga. The carnitas weren't what he expected. They were a bit dry and weren't the shredded soft kind hes used to so he didnt eat it. He let the server know and sent it back. She asked if she could get him something else but he declined. When we got our check we were still being charged for the chimichanga even tho he sent it back. He talked to the manager Mimi. Her answer was, "" you should have asked for the shredded carnitas."" She made it clear that she believed she was right and the customer was wrong. She came to the table and offered 50% off the chimichanga meal. I asked her why if they had two types of carnitas it's not on the menu ot wasnt mentuoned by the server. She was very quick to say that other restaurants do it different ,but they have two types. Again i asked, if you have two types why wasn't  it mentioned. She said she thought 50% was fair because we also had chips and soup. I asked her why she was arguing with me if all i was asking was why if theres two types of carnitas it's not mentioned upon ordering. She mentioned  that she still believed that 50 was fair but that if we wanted off the check she would take it off. She walked away with the check and came back with it off our check. We don't go to restaurants to get a free meal. We go to have an experience and try amazing food. A customers feed back should be most important to a restaurand and it's managers. We didn't apreciate Mimis attitude. I loved everything else about the restaurant but vecause her unappreciative and rude attitude, we will not be back.

It also happens to be about two blocks away from my home, so maybe that has something to do with it. This is a fantastic lunch spot and I've been here about 20 times in the last two years. It's a pretty large place between the restaurant and cantina side so if there's wait it usually isn't too long. I work from home and have often just came here for lunch where I almost always get the shrimp fajitas for $11 and leave stuffed. This can be attributed to the fact that I eat way too many tortilla chips because the warm bean dip they bring when you sit down is addictive. Service is usually pretty good here and I've never had a complaint about the food either. Perhaps the only thing I dislike about coming here is that it's in a busy shopping center next to In-N-Out so parking can suck sometimes, but it's not really a big deal.",8dOqtvJubv4nUcl04XFU1w,0,0,5,GZIm0szi1fCOoUWiw4ke9w

Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!

So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entrée comes out. 

So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place ""Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina"". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sautéed veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it. 

As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.

So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,30,23,5,JECzerq87aHFTAFjsAW8QA

I loved the steak fajita and the california burrito was also really yummy and unique. The churro dessert was very good as well. They also provide you with so many complimentary appetizers like fresh tortilla chips with multiple dips and they will give refills on chips or dips. We refilled our refried bean dip about 3 times because it was so delicious. They also provide a complimentary soup which was reminiscent of noodle soup with chicken broth. We went home with full bellies and lots of leftovers. 

The service here was amazing. We came in 7pm on a monday and it was packed with a 25 minute wait. Somehow we were seated in only 5 minutes and our servers came by very frequently always refilling our drinks and dip and chips.

As soon as we sat down the chips hit the table along with a bean dip and fresh roasted peppers and onions. Right off the bat the service was excellent and we never had less than 3 waiters hovering around for our every request. We all settled in with drinks before ordering our dinners. I went with the Guadalajara special, I got a large piece of Carne Asada topped with scallops and shrimp covered in a delicious brown sauce of some sort.My Carne Asada was a bit overcooked for my taste, but the seafood and that sauce were simply amazing. Everybody got different things including my niece who went with an order of the Taquitos. Her Taquitos were huge enough that they made a meal  for herself and her girlfriend.

It is so perfectly blended that you cannot taste the tequila. As for munchies, we were given an endless supply of chips, salsa, and refried beans. Yum.

As for our entrees, they were ridiculously good. We both live in San Diego, so our standard for Mexican food is relatively high, but I would come here in a heartbeat, if in the area again.

There's not too many Mexican places I can rave about, but this place is. And for those who think Lindo Micochan is So Great - first of all, that place is terrible and Both times I went, service was lousy and the food was not only over priced but not even that good. Anyways! 
My friend and I walked in on a Friday night with no wait, around 8pm. We were brought to a booth with a friendly hostess and no more than 4 minutes later we were brought chips with bean dip and salsa. Both were good. 
Then a few minutes later, we were brought Fideo soup! That was unexpected even though it comes complementary at some places. I have to say, I'm not huge on this soup because nobody ever seems to get it right and I've tried it at a few places. This was by far the best Fideo soup I've ever had and was impressed already. 
Our waiter, Amanda, was So Friendly and pleasant along with being helpful with the menu, it was very comforting along with the great soup and chips so far.
I got the chimichanga with shredded chicken which came with a generous portion of sour cream and some guacamole and pico. I also got a taco with shredded chicken on the side with rice tortilla, fried. It was whoa! Ask for the house salsa with the taco or whatever you get and I recommend mixing in a little tapatio sauce. You'll be happy you did. 
Great portion sizes too! All that and my friend got an enchilada burrito with veggies on the side. I can't believe they serve veggies on the side. That's unheard of, and I'm not talking about a few peppers and onions. No. It was broccoli, zucchini and cauliflower that filled 1 half of the plate and had really nice seasoning on it and it; so good with the salsa too! All that for $28.

I saw this place every time I was going up or down Trop (we live nearby) and always wondered how it was.  Our friend told us she loves the place and we had to try it.  Ho-leeee Mo-leeeeeeee.  Their food is amazing. Authentic Mexican (we're from San Diego - we KNOW Mexican food).  I would go on and on and on about their food, but suffice it to say, EVERYTHING is beyond FRESH and DELICIOUS.  They start you off by not only bringing chips (which by the way are really good - not greasy, light and always fresh and hot), they bring you the salsa, some beans and a bowl of fideo soup.  If you haven't ever had fideo soup, you haven't lived.  It's so easy to scarf down those chips, so be careful!  I order the fish tacos - and I swear they make their own tortillas. I keep meaning to ask every time we're there.  If they don't - they're the best corn tortillas you'll ever eat in a restaurant.  My husband usually orders tacos, enchiladas, or burritos, and he's always loved what he's got.  Never one complaint about the food. And I'm picky.  Especially with Mexican.  I grew up eating it in Tijuana.  

The best part?  AWESOME wait staff.  Never have to wait for refills, always checking on  you, and always very very pleasant.  

Definitely check this place out if you've been curious. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",7Z4BAnL79cdsMgRnZwQCBw,3,3,5,BpQpQDqmHP7Esn26cOJjrw

I ordered the mole inchelada which I could tell the chicken was pre-cooked and overlooked. Why are you guys wasting sour cream and lettuce? Nobody eats that, I could of gotten an extra enchilada for what was wasted in lettuce. I went with a party of five, I can tell the cook needs major improvement you can tell that none of the food is fresh. And for the price per plate I rather go to Denny's. I don't see this restaurant open when their lead is over. The
Ambience is dead boring, the manager took the waiters check which I don't approve of because I have worked in the restaurant business. The place can use a touch up, and I can save the owner more money Nd put more quality in the food myself. The French fries and chicken fingers my kids for we're just plain crap they didn't even eat them because it was so gross.  Cut back on the waste, fix the lighting. Have some Mexican music playing, make me feel like I'm in Mexico for some real Mexican food. Not some microwaved feel dinner, no offense.

The chips and salsa are excellent and bean dip is super good!
The service was outstanding. Several workers checked on us throughout our meal and were very friendly. I can't wait to go back.

As soon as we sat down, we were asked for our drink orders and were served a complimentary chips and salsa/bean dip. All of that happened even before we can open the menu! It's a bunch of different servers working together. I think that's one of the things that made this place stand out for me. We have one server who took our orders but there were a bunch of other people working around making sure our drinks were filled, our dips were not running low, the used plates were out of the way, everything they were on top of it!

The food was excellent too. I got shrimp fajita that came with a side of rice, guacamole and beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. I was excited to see them light it on fire! It was surely entertaining! If you order the combo on a Tuesday night, instead of paying $12, you only pay $10. The portions were huge and the sauces they provided were abundant. For two people, it was definitely a feast. We made room for desserts and ordered churros. It was sooooo good. Maybe because I have been craving them but seriously, with a little bit of whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, those churros were melt in my mouth good.

My husband and I stumbled upon Juan's when we were going to in-n-out (who they share a parking lot with) and knew we had to try it - we are so glad we did. We were quickly welcomed by the host, who I believe is the owner, seated quickly, and had the best first experience - our server explained the menu, made suggestions, and was just a pleasure to be around. Every single one of our experiences since then have been just as awesome, or better. The service is always spectacular, fast, and everyone working always acts like a team. The last time we came on a weekend, they had a full mariachi band and chorus of singers - the atmosphere here is warm and comfortable, but also lively and fun... It's like they're welcoming you into their home. That's how great this place is.

Now the food - yes, the tacos are amazing. The chips and salsas (they have several- just ask!) are fresh and tasty - but they live by their name. The fajitas are where it's at!!! They have a great deal for fajitas for 2 - we always get chicken, and they are truly the best fajitas we have ever had. It's a huge portion and we always have leftovers. Plus we love when they come out, pour the vodka over the grill, and light the flames - what a presentation :) 

We're completely in love with this place and it's hands down our favorite mexican place in Vegas. Highly, highly, highly recommend!",jHN9V2Wr54ItVRrLBRaJQw,3,2,5,T-XyK1e9ZyKHXeepplhLag

3131343,2018-05-24,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"I am extremely disappointed in my experience this evening at Juan's. My husband have enjoyed coming here regularly since moving to Las Vegas. Their Queso Dip is one of the reasons we like it so much. Tonight, we were having friends over and decided to order their queso to-go to bring home and share. Upon arriving, the to-go waitress brought out a very small cup in a brown bag with nothing else. When I asked why there were no chips, I was told ""chips and salsa are only complimentary for dine in guests"". I reiterated that I ordered the Queso ""DIP"" and was expecting chips to DIP in the dip. She again said that ""chips and salsa are only complimentary for dine-in guests"" but she would be happy to ADD chips and salsa to my order. Let me be very clear, this was not a small side of queso that we ordered, it was an appetizer listed under appetizers on their menu. If the queso is not SERVED WITH chips it should not be listed as an appetizer but as a side instead! The to-go server did not see the problem with an appetizer of queso with no chips and ensured me I could ADD salsa and chips. I had no interest in adding additional food to an order I expected to be complete with chips. She did not offer to bring only chips, only that I could add them with salsa. 

In the past, the same to-go/host has greeted us. She's not friendly. The service staff is usually much more friendly. But, we go for their food. After this experience and the disappointing fact that because I'm not DINING in this evening I will not be given chips with the queso ""DIP"" appetizer I ordered to go, we will not be returning to this restaurant. Juan's is not the closest Mexican Food Restaurant to our house, but we've enjoyed the food. After this experience with their host / to-go person, we will find a different restaurant to frequent. 

I want to give zero stars for this evening alone, but I don't think it's fair to the kitchen staff to not at least be recognized for the food we've enjoyed in the past.",6C7zGfmJpIsWq2hy2_CDjw,0,0,2,pMnuJwUa_FMr1BGnQy43qA

Here are my issues: Their service sucks! 

We ordered their namesake- Flaming Fajitas. This was our first time here and I specifically wanted to see the flames. The person who brought the cart over didn't say anything. He just lit up the food. I had my back turned and was engaged in conversation. I happened to turn around as the flames were lit and had to get the attention of the people at the table to watch the 7 second spectacle. If this was the only issue, it's not a big deal. But it wasn't. 

Here's the main issue: The fajitas are served with a plate of rice and beans. I barely ate one fourth of it before the waiter asked to take it away. I would understand if my plate was empty but it wasn't. I informed him I was still eating. About 5 minutes later, he stops by and asks if I want to box up my food. I had another uneaten plate on the table which I was going to eat after I finish my fajitas. However, I felt rushed so I said ok to a box. I guess I'll just eat it at home. He brought the box and I placed it at the corner of the table so I could finish my first plate. He came by another two times to clear out dishes while 5 of us were still actively eating with no empty dishes to clear out. Dishes that my family were still eating from. We basically were being kicked out of the restaurant. We were not even asked if we wanted to order dessert which we were planning on doing. We were in the restaurant at the table for about 35 minutes from start to finish. I don't think that's too long of a time to be kicking people out.",rnu6_8XdSxyz0bcohkbgjA,1,0,2,9CWA8OOiHsuj61N0JV7yaQ

The chips are served with two kinds of salsa.  I only had the red, which was great and perfectly spiced.  They also served grilled onions and peppers to go with them, which is a nice touch.   I had the combination steak and chicken fajitas.  They were great and flavorful.  They brought them out sizzling on a cart.  And then they pour something on them and light them on fire. It is a neat presentation.  They serve them with soup (which I opted not to have, because I felt like it would be too much food), your choice of refried or black beans, rice, guacamole, and pico de gallo, as well as choice of corn or flour tortillas (I got the corn).  And the tortillas are made there at the restaurant.  It was awesome.  My only complaints are that the rice and beans were lukewarm.  It was alright though, because I put them into the fajitas anyway.  They brought the tortillas a couple of minutes after my food, which they probably were fresh from the oven, which was nice, but they probably should wait and bring everything at once.  The worst thing is that it is in the same parking lot as a crappy In-N-Out Burger.  I almost got into a wreck twice, with people trying to get to In-N-Out.

The bartender who's name is ""Juan"" (not the owner) can't multitask to save his life. I waited 15 minutes and he never even acknowledged me or said hi or anything at all. There were only two people at the bar and I was one of them. He just stood back there making drinks pretty much staring straight down not caring about anything else. I asked to be moved into the restaurant because of terrible service in the bar and then on the restaurant side my order was taken immediately by my waiter as it always is on my visits. Customer service goes a very long way in my book and unfortunately that guy has none. They might want to tell him to step his game up or get rid of him.

UPDATE: I was served again by that same bartender last week and he was on point and very helpful, so maybe the first day he was just having an off day.",ReEsgGUwwHG5616YbjAjAw,1,0,5,Sem_FvwiMIL6KMeXW5UKAA

3357730,2013-11-03,2,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"First I would like to give you a short history on my relationship with Mexican food so that you can fully understand how genuine my review is.  I was born and raised for 17 years in Los Angeles, where I was treated with fantastic Mexican food on every corner.  I moved to Las Vegas and worked in construction for 10 years, surrounded by Mexicans and their wondrous food.  I learned to appreciate everything about authentic Mexican food as well as learn their language.  The problem, there was no good authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas.

I have tried almost every restaurant Las Vegas has to offer, and I can tell you now, after visiting Juan's almost 10 times, there is no question that Juan's is the best.

You are always greeted at the door with a smile.  If there is no wait, you are quickly seated and if you don't like the table, the host/hostess is more then willing to switch you to the table of your choice.  The bussers  are always quick to respond to your table with chips, salsa, bean dip, and a plate of sauteed jalapenos and onions.

The salsa is the closest to Los Angeles style restaurant salsa I have found in Vegas.  My wife caught me eating it with a spoon yesterday.  Yes, it is that good.  The bean dip is the best I have ever had.  I can't explain to you what that really means, just know that Mexican food is my absolute favorite and I love my bean dip.  My wife loves to take the onions, dump them in her bean dip and eat them with a chip.  The flavor is pretty mind blowing.  I prefer to take a jalapeno, and put it on every chip dipped in beans.  If you like spicy or jalapenos, give it a try.  Beware because they staff will continue to replace the bean dip and salsa and attempting not to stuff yourself on these delicacies is a difficult task.

Juan has 8 beers on tap.  8!  For a Mexican restaurant this is quite unique.  I have sampled the Dos Equis, Negro Modelo, Victoria, and my wife's Budlight.  The draft is always fresh and the prices are amazing.  Their happy hour runs from 3-7 every day throughout the entire restaurant.  A 22 oz fresh draft for $4.50 is hard to beat.  Every Mexican brew is served with a lime.

I am usually almost full by the time the entrees come around but I try to find a way to fit them in.  I have enjoyed every item on their vegetarian menu, their flaming fajitas, their carne asada, and all their entree's have been excellent.  Their flaming fajitas have a great presentation and the portion size is rather large.  There is one restaurant in Las Vegas that beats Juan's just in the Fajita category and that restaurant is called Leticia's.  The reason is because Leticia adds mushrooms and zucchini into her fajitas.  I had to find a solution for this because my wife is a Fajita snob and I didn't want to go to a restaurant that lacks in all other categories because their fajitas were ""better"" (according to my wife of course).  The solution was simple.

""Could we add mushrooms and zucchini to our fajitas?""  we asked.  ""Of course"" was the reply.  And so, our love affair with Juan's has continued and my wife gets the fajitas her way, every time, and they are excellent.

This restaurant is the best Mexican food that Las Vegas has to offer and I would put it up against any place in L.A, anytime.  To all my friends that haven't had a chance to partake in Juan's, make time, you are missing out on life.

P.S.  If the staff makes any slight mistake, which most restaurants would shrug off, you will be treated with free churros and whip cream.  Pray for a mistake because they rarely make one.",cMZVJdi_fKG7rp1no_2ZvA,7,2,5,TnMMgtIclFfE02C9R6DpiA

When I looked through the menu I noticed a vegetarian section and was impressed that they notified vegetarians that their bean dip was not vegetarian and that there was an option of vegetarian bean dip. 

I ordered a vegetarian burrito with no cheese, cauliflower, and sauce. The burrito I got was literally just a bunch of vegetables wrapped in a tortilla with no beans inside. There were beans on the plate and another portion of vegetables, including cauliflower. 

The vegetables were good, but I was a little disappointed. I was expecting something like a portion of black beans, rice, and some veggies inside the burrito, but that's just not what it turned out to be. 

My boyfriend order the California Burrito with chicken and thought it was pretty good, but not amazing. One of our family friends also did not think the food was that great. His grandma seemed satisfied with her shrimp fajitas. 

The waiters were very nice though! They put a sombrero on grandma's head and sang her happy birthday, giving her little churros with a cherry and candle. They also brought a ""shot"" (looked more like a glass but it probably was watered down) of tequila out per her request and said, ""ready?"" She said yes and they held it to her mouth and had her chug it, no warning. It was pretty funny.

I'll give a 5 star review if I feel the food/service really warrants it.  Well guess what, today I'm giving a 5 star review. Several co-workers of mine recently came here and raved about the place.  So today, I decided to accompany them again and check out this place for myself.  Before you know it, there was group of 10 heading here for lunch.

When we arrived, we entered into the lobby and there was no host or hostess to greet us. However, 45 seconds later, we were welcomed by a gentleman. I said that we had a group of 10. He told me that the wait will only be a few minutes while they set up.  We didn't wait more than 4 minutes to be seated.  Immediately, a few servers came over and gave us chips/salsa and took our drink orders.  I explained that we would like separate bills and the server advised that we they cannot split 10 of us. I then asked for a compromise (5 on each bill) and he agreed. He even apologized to me when I was leaving for the inconvenience. I explained to him that I understand the policy and thanked him for splitting the bill.

Our orders were promptly taken and we were provided updates on our food by the server. Meanwhile, our server along with his help, refilled our drinks, and constantly kept our chips/salsa bowls full.

When I placed my order, I asked for french fries instead of beans and the server without problem said that he can sub the fries for the rice and beans. I was very happy that he allowed me to make the swap.

The food came very fast and it was delicious. I asked for cheese and ketchup for my fries and the ketchup was given to me 20 seconds later. Talk about efficient. These servers were right on point. I ordered the steak fajita and it was perfect.  

When we finished, the server processed our payment quickly and thanked us all for coming.  I will definitely return here as a result for the great food and superb staff. I hope the owner reads this review and feels proud that he has such a great team.  Feel free to send me a private message for more details on my dining experience.

Their service is PHENOMENAL! It was jam packed busy and someone was always helping us at our table. If the server wasn't there, someone else was attentive to come by our table and ask if we needed anything. They are on top of the way they run things here so don't worry, no matter how busy it gets, they have enough people to attend to you.

We could see he took a great pride at what he did and really enjoyed his workplace. The owner (or manager, I was not sure) was constantly checking on us making sure everything was to our liking and there were no complains from our side. We used to go to Mi Lindo Michoacan a lot for its Queso Fundido, now this place can easily compete with them. Got a pitcher of margarita made with Corralejo Anejo only for $28 and that's some good stuff!!! Bartender recommended Steak and Shrimp Fajitas and that's what we got for an entree. When the food runner brought it to us he actually flamed the cast iron skillet. Great presentation! Now the flavor was....WOW!!!
Shrimp were so fatty and juicy and steak had nice charr, just the way we like it. 
They told us it's going to be a great fiesta for May, 5th with mariachis and drinks specials, so we will do our best to make it there ( we are in the middle of moving).
Thank you gentlemen for taking such a great care of us! We will be back soon and I would highly recommend it to fellow yelpers!

Came here for dinner with some awesome peeps, Anthony (always fabulous), Cathy and Mark. The company was great. We always have a fun time. 

The service was good, above average. However, $15.95 for beef, chicken or pork fajitas seems high to me. ($1 extra for shrimp). For a combo it's $25.95 (again a buck more for shrimp). The side of guac and sour cream wasn't enough (I mean is there ever enough sour cream? Me thinks not). The fajita's tasted OK. But, for a place that specializes in them, I thought they'd have more wow. They serve horchada which I love. And even that didnt impress me. It tasted weak and strong on cinnamon. 
They do serve complimentary chips, salsa and beans. I happened to like the beans, but the salsa wasn't good. I wouldn't say it's expensive necessarily, but it's certainly not cheap food.

3517564,2014-06-14,2,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"A fun, lively atmosphere, solid food, and good service make this one of the better Mexican restaurants in town. The top item to try is the one they're known for -- the flaming fajitas. It's a tableside show of high flames that kids will love. The beef and chicken fajitas for two is the way to go. Portion sizes were large enough that two of us had some left to take home. 

Their guacamole is plenty good as are their margaritas, which they have several to choose from. Try a two item combo if you can't decide what to get. I opted for a chicken tamale that had a masa texture that was somewhat thick and gummy, but the flavor was solid. The al pastor burrito was filled with chunks of smokey, deep flavored pork. To finish the meal we tried their churros -- unfortunately too oily.

This place doesn't try to redefine the cuisine, they just do a solid job of executing typical Mexican-American fare at decent prices in a great atmosphere.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,4,4,x6r2j2WzmYpriYcEJj2bEA
3519519,2013-12-22,16,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"I finally tried out JFF! The parking lot was packed when we arrived, so I worried we might have to wait long for a table. Nope! Just a couple minute wait and we were on our way. Soon chips, salsa and bean dip were at our table. They also brought a side of grilled veggies! The salsa was alright, but could have been thicker for my preference. The bean dip was very good as were the chips. Our server mentioned they have excellent guacamole made table-side. The guac sounded good and I would be the only one trying it so, I asked for the small side priced at $3.95 on the menu. The small side of guacamole was not made table-side so I didn't get to choose any of the ingredients that went into the guac. It was just brought to the table already prepared. I didn't like it at all. it was just bland mashed avocados with way to many tomatoes in it. I would have liked some onion, jalapeno, salt and maybe even some lime, but I wasn't offered any. The kicker for me was when my food arrived and there was about the same amount of the same exact bland guacamole on my plate that I paid extra for prior. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered the other, but the server also said it would be made table-side and to my customization.

My friend and I ordered ""Combo Fajitas For Two"" priced at $25.95 with beef and pork. This comes with a cup of ""Fideo Soup"" that is out of this world yummy. The soup really packed some delicious flavor. One thing that impressed me here is that a lot of the time when you order fajitas somewhere it usually is just meat and tortillas, but they actually gave a small side of sour cream, bland guacamole, pico de gallo and you can choose flour or corn tortillas. The meal also came with rice and beans that were very good. The fajitas were so-so for me. The meat is thicker than I am used to and was a bit tough and the bell peppers were still to raw and not cooked enough. My hubby ordered his own combo plate that had Chile Relleno and a Cheese Enchilada and thought it was good, but nothing to write home about. There were major hits and misses with the whole meal. Our server was very friendly and checked on us often. It was worth at least giving it a try! Will I come back? Not anytime soon, but I can see giving JFF another shot at some point maybe with a coupon.

(grilled onions and jalapenos were also provided.) while it did take a little time for the food to arrive we had fun enjoying the atmosphere and the kids liked watching them make fresh tortillas. we of course ordered a flaming fajita plate, which was impressive and delicious but the rest of us couldn't resist ordering from the happy hour menu, which was impressively inexpensive and incredibly filling (maybe partly because you can almost eat your entire dinner with the bean and salsa dips?). they also provide complimentary soup, which is like a tomato-based soup with rice (the kids loved it), and we all left with to-go boxes! they do have tv's all around tuned into sports if that's something that you're into but a slight draw-back since we had young kids and a couple of the tv's were showing a pretty graphic boxing match.

The Chef and Wait staff are equal to none and by far the best in Las Vegas. Most of them have worked together for  many years for an established Mexican restaurant that suddenly closed about a year or so ago . The Chef has been doing his thing here in LV for many years and is one of the best. Juan's has everything going for it including some of  the best food salsa and Margaritas north of the boarder. This is also a Dallas Cowboys bar and has great deals on appetizers on game days and nights. Juan's is a great addition to the Mexican restaurant scene in LV.

3623041,2015-05-11,2,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"I feel like I need to visit this place a 2nd time to give it a good sound review but I really don't know when I would get an urge to come back again. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and although it's only 5 minutes from my home, it has taken me at least a year to finally make the trip. It might be because I've pretty much given hope on Mexican food in Las Vegas and rather just wait till my trips back to Texas to satisfy my cravings. Well unfortunately Juan's Flaming Fajitas has not changed my outlook on Mexican food in this city.

They provide salsa and refried beans with a basket of chips for you to snack on while you wait. I really liked the salsa but I wish it was a bit more spicier. Or just spicy in general. Kudos to them for being on point with switching out our baskets as we were close to running low on chips. 

I think these places are smart to provide free chips and salsa because it almost makes you lose track of time of how long your food is getting to the table while you're snacking away, this trickery didn't work on our party though! It took quite some time for us to finally get our food and when it did, 2 of the 4 dishes were already cold leaving it unappetizing -- cold burrito with hardened cheese and soggy fries in the middle? No thanks. 2 of the dishes down, and leaving one of our friends running to the restroom right away. Yikes.

Luckily I was on the (somewhat) winning side of the order. I ordered the Taco Salad which wasn't bad, but how do you really mess up a taco salad anyway? And it sitting out too long doesn't affect it too much, only made my lettuce a little wilted but didn't completely ruin my meal. My friend ordered the fajitas and although it's pretty cool they have it at high flames next to your table, I honestly think it's just for show and does nothing really special for the dish itself other than warm it up again. They then place this giant cauldron with the fajitas sitting on top of it in front of you, taking a large amount of space with little room left for the other people at the table or even (large) side dishes like your beans and rice. 

The prices weren't terrible and it seemed as clean as it could be. I don't think this place is an ultimate failure, we just didn't have the best first experience. Sadly it's the first impressions that matter the most right? So I have to confidently say that it will be quite some time till I feel I can go at this again.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,7,5,3,BfSbb5vTFCEWEDzlVWciWw

Lunch Specials FTW!!! I thought that was pretty neat that they had the options to choose 1, 2, or 3 items to make a combo. Ironically, I'm not a fajita person, so I ordered the Chimichanga & Rancho Style Taco ($10.49)

I wish I enjoyed the Chimichanga more, but it had a bitter/burnt/smokey taste that I'm NOT a fan of. And it was soggy vs. crunchy =(

The taco, rice, and beans were good though.

The service was superb and is what'll bring me back. They were super busy & food took a little longer to come out (during the lunch hour). But, their servers & staff ensured we were okay.",Kq_Cg-INSv4i8wNo1kDF-w,2,3,4,nPd62F5zth_8eVTT7Sc_2Q

3652399,2015-08-17,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"My wife and I are new to Vegas, and after an underwhelming return from our google search for good Mexican food, we decided to try Juan's out.

The restaurant is nice enough: good appearance, well decorated and thought out, everything appeared clean inside and out.  Be prepared for a tight parking situation if you arrive during the lunch hour.  When we went, Juan's was not busy, but its already narrow parking lot is situated right next to a popular In N Out location which can make things a bit tricky around that time. Not a real problem, however.

I enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa.  The chips weren't served warm but they were fresh and tasted quite good.  The salsa was enjoyable too.  It was a pretty standard house salsa but I didn't mind it at all.  Most Mexican restaurants offer free chips and salsa when you dine in, but what I really appreciate about Juan's is there unique addition to this tradition.  They also bring out a bowl of refried beans (very tasty), and a plate of roasted Jalapenos and sauteed onions to the table.  Honestly, I love snacking before a meal, and im a spicy food fanatic, so these complimentary offerings really speak to me.

I can't say I enjoyed the rest of my experience as much. My wife ordered a steak fajita burrito and I got a two-item lunch combo with a chile relleno and an enchilada.  The presentation was decent, but there were no stand-out flavors.  Enchiladas are one of my favorite things in the world to eat and I've got to say that Juan's take on them are just sort of average. I liked the relleno a little better, but it wasn't great.  The meat in my wife's burrito was pretty good but she didn't like her meal, overall.  I'll admit, it's a little unfair to visit a place with ""Fajitas"" in the title and not order a fajita platter to try on our first trip, so maybe we'll try that if we ever return.

Juan's serves pretty decent Mexican food, the place is clean and the staff is friendly.  I didn't hate anything, but nothing really left me wanting more.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,2,0,3,-uXVLmsrRTNoZDZCXdecNg

Located right next door to the In N Out drive thru (on West Trop.) Juan's is a legit Mexi restaurant. Food was very good especially their Fajitas...go figure! 

Free chips and two types of Salsa and a great bean dip!!!

Great ambiance! Great bar ( killer patron Margs!)! Their combo plates are legit too!

Service was super friendly and helpful. Table side guacamole is cool!

Juan's also has an amazing happy hour every day and daily specials (each day is different so check out their website). The day we were there it was 15% off for Veterans ( That is Awesome!!!! Thank you!!!)

The appetizers are very tasty with good fideo, grilled onion and jalapenos, and salsa and beans for the chips. The table side guacamole is also good a good choice. The only detractor is the chips. I thought that they used to make their own tortilla chips but the last few times they were underwhelming and bland. I don't know where they got them but I would much rather have true tortilla chips. 

The meals taste great and the portions are plenty big enough (2 piece combo fills me up and you can add another item still). I've enjoyed the fish tacos and carne asada burrito (red sauce) among other things. The taco salad with grilled vegetables is another highlight for me. On birthdays they will humiliate your friend by throwing a sombrero on and singing their version of happy birthday so that's an entertaining plus ( they get a super sweet churro dessert for being a sport).

Everything was delicious especially their famous Flaming Fajitas. I opt for the steak fajitas and enjoyed every bite. The meat was well seasoned and wasn't over cook but consistent and flavorful especially the grilled veggies and I was surprised with the portion size for a single serving of fajitas.

My sister and I shared a Flan for dessert and didn't regret it, because it was simply amazing especially since we had one in awhile. The soft texture and not so sweet caramelized sauce was perfect.

Our server Noemi was very friendly and energetic like the majority of the employees including a manager on staff.

Arriving on Tuesday afternoon, the place was packed.  The hostess recommended I sit in the bar area.  Unfortunately, the table they sat me at was right by the door going out to the patio, so cold air would rush in every time they opened the door.

I ordered a house margarita, which was pretty good.  Chips and 3 types of salsa came out soon after.  The salsa was mild.

I ordered the flaming steak fajitas.  It came out 10 min. later, I was still working on the chips and salsa.

One observation about the fajitas, is that they didn't have a lot of seasoning to it.  Besides that, it was some good fajitas.

My waiter Sebastian was very accomadating.  Other staff members stopped by the table to see how I was doing, I was never left alone.

After looking at the menu for awhile, my wife opted not to have the fajitas for two but ordered the chicken azado Vallarta style--salsa Española with capers, banana peppers, and olives.  I ordered the flaming fajitas.  After all, it's the name of the place and that's why I stopped.

We were brought chips, salsa, bean dip, and a small dish of grilled onions and one half of a grilled jalapeño.  Standard fare except for the grilled onions and jalapeño.  

In a short time, our dinners arrived.  Mine was flamed near the table but far enough away for safety.  The fajita pan is a high pan with a circular top.  The chicken, peppers, and onions were nicely grilled and the flavors were very good.

My wife's chicken was good, and it was a very large portion.  I have leftovers for dinner this evening.  It was one whole chicken breast.

Not finishing her meal allows my wife to justify dessert.  I need no justification.  We shared an order of fried ice cream that was very good.  The crust on the outside was tasty and the ice cream was nice to have on one of our 100 degree summer days.

Service was excellent.  Multiple people came to check on iced tea refills, was it OK to remove dishes, anything else, etc.  One of the managers (owners?) came by and chatted and made sure all was well.  He asked if it was our first time at the restaurant.  He explained some of their current promotions.

I normally would have given Juan's a 3 star rating.  However, the service and the appreciation shown for patronizing Juan's figured in my upping the review to 4 stars.  I appreciate when businesses give good service and are glad that you stopped there given all the choices we have in this city.  I am a fan!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,8,4,k_lVyd1aYO1yafF68A9ILQ

The chips and salsa were fine, in fact, the salsa was actually pretty flavorful. The fajitas were very enjoyable, but the accompaniments left a lot to be desired. The refried beans creeped me out a little, and my wife reported her guacamole to be quite watery at the bottom. They just didn't seem very fresh.

I had a pretty strong-ass Patron margarita, too. Although - and this sounds totally lame - the balance was a bit off. The tequila overpowered the rest of the drink. I know - that's the dumbest thing ever to complain about.

There was no seating at bar either, so we had to stand, but bar tenders were quick and friendly. They have happy hour EVERYDAY! The margaritas were like $5 and cheap beers. The margaritas were not watered down. I had the Pina Colada flavor, and it had sweet pieces of coconut and pineapple. 
I also had a spicy watermelon that was not on happy hour menu, but only $9 nice flavors and strong. 
Our waiter was really nice and took our orders pretty quick. Then we had the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. The bean dip is sooo good, but no free refills. 
2 other staff members came by to check on us throughout our meal and even apologized to us for the long wait.
Our food was delish and tasted homemade. Beans were creamy and full of garlic flavor. My fave was the chile relleno. It was stuffed with cheese and had a nice crispy coating even with the delish red sauce on top.

4053210,2014-01-13,10,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Happy Birthday, Tita Shirley B!!  

For now on when I think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas, I going to think about Shirley B's Birthday celebration. It was Shirley's pick to come here.  And when people asked her why Juan's for her birthday, her response was ""because it's MY birthday"".  I agree with your choice, Tita.  Juan's was a great dinner.  

One thing I love about fajitas in general is that you can chose to make it a high calorie meal or a low calorie meal.  It really all depends how many fajitas you plan on demolishing and what you put in it.  But Juan's is more than just their infamous flaming fajitas, right?  Sure it is.  At Juan's there's a huge selection of Mexican dishes and by the looks at everyone's orders around the restaurant, the dishes are definitely hooked up.  Review their menu...you got burrito options, taco concoctions, salads, nachos, ensaladas, soups, chimichangas, and of course, fajitas.  But before I even talk about their main dishes, I have to mention their bottomless tortilla chips.  My goodness, it should be a crime that these are bottomless.  The chips didn't even have a chance.  After multiple chip refills (i.e. 9 basket of chips), I came to the conclusion that their tortilla chips are addicting.  I swear, they should rename this place to Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Tortilla Chips.  Just saying. 

Everyone on our table, with the exception of Chad S and Mr B (aka Shirley's husband), got the fajitas.  I didn't try Chad's Carne Asada Burrito, but was able to sample some of Mr. B's Steak Taquitos.  The taquitos are bigger than most. It's was more like a mini-chimichanga if you ask me.  Terri and I shared the steak & chicken fajita combo (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=l3lS7rPzGYQukY10aqTMSQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ).  This is huge, feeds two, and was served flaming.  Yup...this was one good dish.  Both the steaks and chicken were seasoned, properly cooked, tender, and fresh.  Hard for me to describe, but their fajitas is pretty much as good as it gets.  

As for their service, I thought that it was pretty good considering how busy the place was.  The restaurant is decently sized with the bar on one side and the main dining area in another.  Both had one thing in common...tons of TV's from every angle.  Yeah buddy!!  Not missing sports at this restaurant.  Our server was Juan.  No joke.  We had Juan, not THE Juan, you know the one.  He was great and treated us like we were his only customers.  It's like Juan on One.  Hah!  All joking aside, Juan was great.  By the way, there's 3 other Juan's working here too.  I bet you can't find that anywhere.  I wonder if I go to Mel's Diner would I find 3 other Mel's.  I bet not.  

Juan's allowed us to take our own desert, which consisted of Hello Kitty cupcakes and an Niner/Hello Kitty Birthday Cake.  All for Shirley B.  Juan and the staff at Juan's brought the deserts to our table while singing Happy Happy Birthday to Shirley B.  

Overall...fajitas and a lot of sugar with friends equals a great time.  Happy Birthday, Shirley B!  Go Niners!!!

Every meal I have had at Juan's was been for lunch, they have numerous lunch specials daily, including a $3.75 lunchtime margarita.  We always sit in the bar area and get fantastic service. 

Every item I have ordered has been fantastic, I especially enjoy the chicken flautas. And I LOVE that you can get steamed veggies in places of the beans and rice as a side, at no added cost.

I came here when this was Buzz, and Juan has really transformed the place.  Looks like a legit Mexican cantina.  Juan himself greeted us at the door and sat us at our table.  3 big screen tvs are visible in the dining room.  Always good, especially during the NCAA tournament (if you are not a Kentucky fan like myself).  Negra Modelo on tap = Sunday Funday.  Although I am a Lindo fan, the chips and salsa at Juan's are much better.  So is the fideo soup.  We decided to split the flaming chicken fajitas because it is the namesake.  Because I will always be 10 years old, I was overly facinated with the tableside flaming fajitas (see pic).  In addition to the show, the fajitas were great.  Came with the aforementioned fideo soup, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, cheese and tortillas.  The only thing I wasn't wowed by were the tortillas, but when your BFF is a latina rockstar and her fabulous momma hooks you up with decilious tortillas, your standards can be pretty high.

The veggies are really good and the seasoning is tasty. Best of all, the kitchen uses high quality meat and it shows. If you don't want beans and salsa, they'll sub a very hearty portion of garlic butter vegetables that are really yummy! 

The tableside flaming fajita show is a lot of fun for kids and adults. It's a neat gimmick. I do think the portion size on the fajitas for 2 is a bit small; you are better off paying a little extra and order your own fajitas. 

The chips are pretty good and the salsas are tasty. I really like the bean dip, it's my favorite. The service has always been absolutely amazing. Out of the few times I've dined here, only once did it take a super long time for our food to come out of the kitchen. I don't know what was going on, but it took over 30 minutes. Usually they are pretty fast, making this a great spot to grab a quick and healthy meal before going to a movie, out shopping, etc. 

I only have two criticisms for the place: 1, make the portion size on the ""fajitas for 2"" a bit larger and 2, I wish the kitchen would serve homemade tortillas. The tortillas are so bad I usually ask for none to be brought to the table.

Once we were seated everything was great. No complaints whatsoever about the food and honestly the best horchata I've ever had.

Two things I think could be improved, one: check on your tables a little more often (everyone was extremely friendly and very accommodating, I just would have liked to have my drink refilled w/out having to flag someone down) and second: the lights were very dim and the ceiling fans were going a little slow creating a very odd effect of making all of us dizzy; had to walk to several tables before finding something acceptable to dine at.

Four people in my party ordered the fajitas which was a sight to see when they came out. They literally lit the skillet on fire and flames were jumping! After a bit the fire went out and we were served. 

I had the flautas which I usually enjoy at other Mexican restaurants. I ordered it in a crispy flour tortilla with grilled vegetables instead of beans and rice. I was surprised that my order was really good! Although they had large servings, I took home my leftovers and had them for lunch the next day. 

The reason why I can't give them the full 5 stars is, as I don't speak Spanish, some of the waiters spoke really fast English and I could not understand them. Additionally, I felt like attitude was given from one person serving us, who I think may have been a manager. Not cool. 

Overall, I would probably eat there again if someone I knew wanted to go. I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, but I would definitely like to try other items on their menu.",Nbrtdj-ODs-UBCALhYg-AQ,0,0,4,PZPbNtaLKQ0U-NRoNa6XNA

As usual, Yelpers were right on the money, this place is FANTASTIC!  Can't recommend it enough - if you're craving Mexican, go to Juan's and you'll have a great meal at a perfect price!

I honestly enjoyed every single thing we ate - the chips (fresh), the salsa (perfect), the soup they automatically serve before your entree, the fajitas, the dips, everything.  I will say it was all slightly on the salty side - but I *love* salt so that's right up my alley.  We ordered the chicken fajitas for 2 and, along with the free chips and salsa, and the tomato-based soup that comes out first, it ended up being 4 meals for the hubs and I.  Well worth the money.  And again, it was all so, so delicious!

The hosts and servers were all super friendly and helpful and everything was brought out quickly.  We honestly don't have a single complaint - except that we didn't go here sooner!  We'll be back very soon to try some of the others options like the quesadillas and enchiladas and I'm already looking forward to it!",p0xGJ_-QMWF8Bp6uCC1j5g,0,1,5,JANZLTqSKIXzYF1w7qxw1A

1.  Excellent chips and salsa ready as soon as you sit down.  Do yourself a favor and put those onions and jalapenos they provide on a chip and dip it in the salsa for a flavor explosion in your mouth!

2.  Super fast and friendly wait staff.  Their ""refreshing drink"" game is on point.

3.  Decent Margaritas for a reasonable price.  The $5 house margarita is an excellent 12oz cocktail.

4.  Mariachi Guitarist!  Spanish guitar helps with the digestion!

5.  The Food is excellent.  The steak fajita is the best I have ever had with juicy and tender steak.  I also enjoy the pageantry and presentation that comes with ordering these flaming fajitas.

6.  FRIED ICE CREAM.  I have always been a fan of the dangerous idea of dropping scoops of ice cream into boiling oil!

For starters, Juan's replaces the mundane chips and salsa from every other restaurant with a medium salsa roja, salsa verde, and bean dip. Both salsas had an appetizing kick, but the verde was my personal favorite. 

As I wandered in around 12:30, I found their lunch specials for $9.99 chicken fajitas. Served with the typical accoutrement of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo, the fajitas were incredible!

You guys delivered on food, customer service and deliciousness. This is my second time visiting Juan's and both times I have been impressed.

On my first visit I ordered a yummy chicken chimichanga with rice and beans and a 16 oz draft beer. The portions are so big that I had plenty of food left over for lunch the next day. 

On our second visit my fiancé and I ordered the smothers steak, and shrimp fajitas for two and oh my oh my. Each person get their own plate of sour cream, guacamole, rice and beans and a choice of flour or corn tortillas. If you sit close to the kitchen you can see someone making fresh tortillas while you wait for your food. I also order a strawberry house margarita and it was delicious. They have all different sizes but I opted for the 12oz and it was perfect. Amanda out waitress informed me that the house margarita is popular because it is in the happy hour menu so it is ordered more, but her favorite was the top shelf margarita. (I'm trying her suggestion on my next visit)

I love how as soon as you sit down someone is there to take your Drink order and give you complementary chips, veggies, bean dip and salsa. I am unsure if soup comes with every meal but the two times that I have visited, I have gotten yummy soup.

The menu has a ton of food options and a great happy hour menu as well as lunch menu.

Service was really attentive from the start. We decided to order the mixed fajita (chicken and beef). We both got Fideo soup and it was pretty tasty. The flaming fajitas part was entertaining but I think what matters is the food. The chicken and beef were tasty and moist and I even ended up eating onions with it and I don't like onions.  I asked for double rice instead of the rice and beans on the side and they gave it to me like I asked! The tortilla was a thicker type kind of like the type you get at Taco Bell, but other than the tortilla everything was delicious.

I've never been here, but I went onto Yelp and searched ""Mexican food"" and this place popped up. I'm glad it did because the food was DELICIOUS! I ordered Enchiladas which were fire!

4234386,2014-04-24,13,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeños. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed ""now that's service!"" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive.

When a restaurant first emerged in this space when I first moved here, there have been at least 2-3 restaurants that have tried to win over the hearts of the locals in the Southwest, but unfortunately they did not succeed. So when we first walked in and saw how busy the place was (there was even a wait!) we were quite surprised!

We were seated within the quoted 10 mins and the moment we sat down, we saw why the word ""flaming"" is in their name! As you can see from the photos, their fajitas are literally shooting out flames up toward the ceiling! They're quite delicious, I guess the flames add a flavor only a flame can add :)

Also on the menu: Table side guacamole, raspberry margarita and a coronita. Good, bomb, and meh. I'd definitely have the raspberry margarita again, damn thing tastes like juice!

4293847,2014-06-21,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"This is another 3.5 star situation for me. But because of a few things, it just feels more like a 3 than a 4. 

My girlfriend and I went here for their happy hour (3-7 daily), and since I love margaritas and very infrequently get them, I was excited about their margarita on happy hour. We got there and we ordered a margarita, a daiquiri, the quesadilla, and the nachos. 

On the happy hour menu, they have a bunch of apps which looked good, but we were sticking to cheap and the nachos and quesadillas were listed as 3.99. 

My margarita was... Bad. It was a house margarita, and weirdly enough I had the exact same experience at a NYC restaurant with their happy hour margarita. It tasted like toilet cleaner. I guess when they pre mix a huge batch for happy hour, it's easy to mess it up. I told the bartender and he switched it out immediately, I don't know if it was because it was good service or because this happens a lot. I barely finished my sentence and he was making me a new fresh one. 

The quesadillas were very very good, and we had agreed to get chicken on it instead of just cheese. I figured ok. At 3.99 we could take the upcharge for chicken right? Well unfortunately he failed to mention that by adding chicken it was no longer the happy hour menu item, so it was $7 dollars. Not a big deal, but was expecting a little bit less. 

The nachos were... Very bland. They had way to much bean on it and it honestly canceled out the cheese taste. It was covered with cheese but you barely tasted it, and nachos without cheesiness are a waste IMO. 

Overall, I liked my second margarita a lot, the daiquiri was pretty good, and the quesadilla was delicious. The manager also checked with us as did the bartender multiple times to make sure things were OK, so clearly they care about service. However, with that bad first margarita and very mediocre nachos, I just can't give this place a four at the moment. Will go back to try again!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,4,1,3,ROW1vrtrBM_oD4XzCobH0g

Came on a gorgeous Sunday evening, hoping to sit outside and enjoy the weather. The patio already had a large party there and our group was large too, no sweat, we can sit inside. 
The restaurant is fairly large with a sort of divided dining are, a patio, and a bar that's separated. I like that it accommodates what ever type of night you're looking to have.
Now the food! I absolutely LOVED the shrimp and steak fajitas! I typically don't order steak unless I'm at an actual steakhouse but took a risk and it paid off! The steak was tender, not at all chewy and had wonderful flavor. The shrimp was great as well. Perfectly cooked with flavors of pepper and onions it was cooked with. I really enjoyed watching the server torch the fajitas, a nice touch that adds flare to the dining experience. 
The fajitas are paired with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, and freshly made tortillas - corn or flour. You're able to swap the tortillas for romaine wraps, as well as rice and beans for steamed vegetables. Great option for the health conscious. I personally would not sacrifice the flour tortillas for a few calories, they were delicious! Oh, the fajitas also came with a little bowl of soup! I really did not need it as, the table tortilla chips were pretty good and kept me busy while waiting for the food.
Another star of the show for me were the margaritas. ON FIRE! I had the raspberry margarita that got me buzzed, followed by a shot of tequillaaaaaaaaaa, then a pina colada margarita... The Pina Colada Margarita was my fave, perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I look forward to having it again and again :)

Finding it wasn't easy, the parking area is kind of poop but we found a good spot, luckily.

Bus boy was polite. Our waiter didn't really come check on us very quickly. Complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip was pretty good. Soup with meal -- the step kids loved it. 

I ordered the taco bowl. It's my go-to since I'm not huge on Mexican food anyway. Food took it's time getting to the table, drinks weren't re-filled very quickly. Different waiter delivered our food but eh, at least it came. My chicken was dry and my bowl was soggy to start. The 1 out of 3 kids enjoyed and devoured their enchiladas and the other two just whined and played with it. Neither one could explain why they didn't like it. So it could just be picky children being picky. My guy ordered the fajitas and the waiter bringing our food forgot to bring the tortillas. It took another 10 minutes to get the tortillas and by that time we were ready to go.

The food is clearly great. We ordered the chicken fajitas - they were juicy, flavorful, and the spectacle of the flames made them even more enjoyable. (One other thing to note: one order was requested to be well done, and the other wasn't; the restaurant did an excellent job of cooking those two and they even came out at the same time). The free soup was good, too. I was definitely a big fan of the salsa since it didn't have huge chunks in it and it also had a little kick. 

But, the main selling point of this place was the customer service. Every staff member we interacted with was kind and attentive, bringing the sides/condiments we needed with no wait. We never even had to ask for water refills or extra tortillas; they were always on top of things. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in how our experience was, as well.

Just as we thought it couldn't get any better, our waiter returned with a complimentary churro dessert to commorate our first visit!

I got the carne asada chimichanga, the meat was very good, I just didn't realize it was going to be served smothered in sauce,  which ruins my favorite part, the crispy shell. But it was still tasty.
My boyfriend had the fork fajitas,  and the meat looked dry, but it was actually very tender, and full of flavor and not dry. He loved his meal!

The problem came after we were seated.  The service was slow at best, and it took about an hour before our food arrived.  They did keep the chips full so it didn't seem horrible. 

Today, we can't seem to get rid of the flaming fajita smell!  It's all over our sweatshirts and jackets and has even defeated a good spray with febreeze!  I thought maybe it was just me, but my son, who lives in his own home, says he has smelled like Mexican food all day.

4436018,2018-03-08,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,Went for the first time this week and had to get the fajitas for the experience. Wonderful display and great conversation piece. Couple of things threw me off though. 1 the size of the plates in comparison with the size of the table. I was so uncomfortable trying to find a place for everything (and squished next to my husband) and that's with two couples ordering only 2 meals to share! The second thing- I ordered veggies as my side with the fajitas expecting veggies I could add into the fajitas? Corn? Additional peppers? Something? But it was steamed cauliflower broccoli and carrots that reminded me of Marie Calendars. Just unfitting for the restaurant lol,_ijyPpSVoZwu6pko7-Ucxg,0,0,3,DIL-uy37p_1UT_kxkuy4ig

4484657,2018-07-01,1,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. With all the great reviews, I don't know why it took us so long to get around to going here. 

We sat in the bar area, which was less crowded than the main dining room. Our waiter, Alex, was right there waiting to take our orders. I try to stay away from mixed drinks these days, but the wine availability is very limited. So I decided to have a small (12 oz.) margarita. Because the kind of wines I wanted wasn't stocked, I was treated to HH pricing and my choice of tequila. It was the best margarita I've ever had, by a landslide. Not too syrupy, just the right amount of ice, and the slice of lime in the bottom of the glass kept it flavorful to the last sip. Next time I won't care about the wine; I'll just go straight for the hard stuff.

We ordered the flaming fajitas for two - chicken for my husband, Mr. Cluck, and shrimp for me. I was so happy to learn that we could have regular or black beans, rice or - be still, my heart - steamed veggies, and could choose two of those in any combination. I swear, in my next life I definitely WILL be a vegetarian! The veggies were a mix of many kinds, and fresh and unadorned, just as I like them. The black beans didn't taste like they came out of a can. The tortillas were the lightest I've ever tasted, which explained why the complimentary tortilla chips were light as air, too.

Those tortilla chips were accompanied by a dish of grilled onions and jalapeno strips, and two salsas and a bean dip. When I tried the bean dip I thought I tasted lard. I asked Alex, and he confirmed it, then asked if we wanted dip without lard. It was replaced before I could blink.

To top off the fabulous service and food, the background was my beloved Mariachi music, making me yearn for the good ol' days, when I was in school there for three summers and then visiting the country often twice a year. Juan's is that authentic, and I look forward to another visit very soon.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,2,5,SQImb0aX6dc2d56XEfTtTQ

Drinks were served promptly and the meal was out quick. My friend and I did the 2 Fajita share with chicken and steak. We also ordered a few drinks. The white queso dip was phenomenal. After a little bit of time, the manager came over and asked for us to move and be reseated to a different location within the bar. I have never, at a restaurant, been asked to be moved to another table after a certain time. Now, we were comped a $5.00 off next visit on the next meal, but after being asked to move, my friend and I promptly left the restaurant.

Im in town for the week and I definitely plan on going back before I leave. I have to try those flaming chicken fajitas.",TJThC4_fVEL3InuH1IrmpQ,1,1,4,uwC53oSQ8D-Z7pVCcTfSxA

The service - server was friendly, professional and helpful. It's like she knew us when I asked her if we should get the two person fajita or the single portion! The manager took time to check on every table in the restaurant which was much appreciated.  He followed up with our table at least twice.  What fantastic hospitality!

Our server suggested the single steak fajitas for both of us since we weren't too hungry.  We ordered it protein style with fresh romaine wraps and in addition we ordered shrimp ceviche and the churros and scoop of ice cream.  Gotta have balance! 

The fajitas came out blazing hot. The food runner lit it and it bursted into flames... hence Juan's Flaming Fajitas.  The steak was juicy with a lightly charred exterior and it came with caramelized onions and peppers.

The shrimp ceviche was alright.  We honestly had better.

The churros were .com So get that with a scoop of dulce de leche  ice cream if you have space.",gtEjMgcW74ZcG0zzMctmKg,0,0,5,pQ3_3mdBJfREK7AfJelRZw

But the 3rd visit puts Juan's back in 4 Star territory. And there are two key reasons for those stars. Our server, Omar provided great service, and then there's the steak. The OMG, melt in your mouth, cooked to perfection steak tacos that my wife ordered. It was so good she shared some with my son and I and it got a unanimous vote of approval. One bite and we gave each other ""that look""... the smile that comes from when you order something and it exceeds your expectations and is just amazing! 

Parking was a bit of a pain as always but the wait was super short, the front door staff actually paid attention to us this time and then when Omar took over we were well on our way to a good experience. 

Try the queso, and don't ignore the plate of jalapenos and onions they bring out. Dip those jalapeno slices in the queso and you'll be hooked. I'm also a fan of their fish taco. It's one of the few that's not overly cooked or more batter than fish.

4744386,2014-04-21,1,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"After coming here a few times, I think the best time to come here is during happy hour, which goes from 4:00pm - 7:00pm daily.  Some of the highlights:

Import Draft Beers: $3.50 for 16oz or $4.50 for 20oz
Well Drinks: $3.50
Margaritas: $3.50 for 12oz or $4.50 for 16oz
Fajita Quesadillas: $6.95

Come in during happy hour, and for around $20 or so you can have quesdillas, free chips and salsa/beans, and three drinks.  Not bad at all.

Outside of happy hour I've had their fajitas: beef, chicken, pork, and shrimp.  The fajitas are decent, but not necessarily something to go out of your way for.  The fajitas for two combo is about $25, which really can be enough for three people if you keep snacking on the chips and dips.  Again, not really good enough to warrant going out of your way for, especially since they close pretty early.  Fridays and Saturdays they close at 10:00pm, the rest of the week they close at 9:00, so unless you're in the area you'll want to be sure to come here early.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,6,1,3,lDSL5q-sZgjt3sGv0TOZvw

4783076,2018-02-14,1,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Food just tastes better here. Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina is at the top of my list for Fajitas and Margaritas. The tables always start off with chips, two salsas, and sauteed onions and jalapenos. It's always fun to try the different combinations of each or just pile them all on and enjoy. Their Steak is  always tender, Shrimp are never overcooked, and the Chicken has never been dry. I'll have to get back to you when I try the Pork. The little flambe show is always entertaining and the char on the veggies and proteins from the sizlling hot fajita grill adds a great smoky flavor. It comes with their rice, refried beans and all the sides you would expect so you know you won't be leaving hungry. 

I always enjoy their Margaritas whenever I get a chance. They pair so well with the food. I'd have to say my favorites so far have been the Mango, Peach, Pina Colada, Raspberry, and Strawberry. All the fruity combinations have me feeling like I'm drinking candy.

Their Happy Hour menu is no joke. You expect portions to be smaller like other restaurants, but what we got looked like a full order. Juan's Flaming Fajitas has given me more for my money on a happy hour menu than any other place I have been to. 

Service has always been friendly and attentive whenever I have visited. I look forward to visiting again. Save a little room for dessert!",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,2,1,4,p-M6N_Abxb3jNQ0mBL7iAQ

It can be hit or miss depending on who you get and how busy it is, but if you are not quite happy or if there is a something amiss they do not hesitate to try to fix it. Luckily, there were no big issues, just a misunderstanding with our fajitas for two. I wanted the shrimp cooked separately and not mixed in with the steak fajitas.

Typical long wait on a Saturday for a known good restaurant. 45 mins- 1hr.

Hostesses were friendly.

Our waiter Omar was EXCELLENT!! He took care of our table with exceptional sevice. He was on top of everything. He checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything else , asking how are meal was and we never had to worry about our drinks being refilled. Service with a smile, professional, and extremely efficient. 5 stars for Omar.

The live music by the gentleman playing guitar was awesome!! We really enjoyed that. :)

Restaurant a bit too smokey for me. Yes, it's because of ALL of the flaming fajitas. Hence the name ""Juans Flaming Fajitas"" I know.  I smelled like mexican food the whole way home. If I come back, I will request the outdoor seating if it's available. ;)

Unfortunately, the food was too salty for my liking. The soup and my steamed veggies were packed with sodium I'm certain. I was unable to finish either. :( 

Fajitas sadly the same. Too much salt. MY goodness! My suggestion- I would have liked the option to salt my food myself, if at all. 

Ambiance was ok,  service was fantastic, dinner was clearly a miss, dessert  (fried ice cream)  was a hit though. That's how I arrived at my solid 3 star rating.

Alot of great things about this restaurant on Yelp. Based on service I would recommend. Definitely give it a try. You can decide. When you do, maybe leave a review. :)",kl_yCsj4ESbUphmpCfVvRA,61,49,3,Qm9j-aeoEhMEazCpDk09Hw

I was next-door getting my car fixed and noticed this place across the street it's always been one of those places where you drive by but never stopped and eat at. It was my best friends birthday so I suggested this place being that we both love Mexican food. Upon arrival we were greeted by 2 really friendly hostesses. I asked if they had happy hour and they said yes from 3 to 7 and it's not only in the bar area like most restaurants its everywhere you sit which is a plus. They have a bar as well as a patio outside. The restaurant had a very authentic Mexican feel, I loved the ambience. I was really surprised with their happy hour menu there were so many choices! The margaritas were amazing and only four dollars for a 12 ounce or five dollars for a 16 ounce you can't beat that! I ordered the piña colada margarita on the rocks and my friend had the blended mango margarita both were amazing and just the right amount of alcohol. I like how they offered complementary chips and three different salsas some restaurants charge extra. I ordered the steak quesadilla and I was so shocked at how big it was two people definitely could have shared it! My friend ordered the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and she was scraping her plate at end it was so good. I informed the waiter that it was my friends birthday and he made sure to bring out a complimentary dessert and they sang for her. Overall I loved the experience at Jauns the service was quick everyone was professional and friendly and very attentive. They have one of the best happy hours I've ever seen I will definitely be back!",y4xrOPXEB75lJaLjr7Rtaw,43,25,5,uZBYa2O4lDKz3MkwtJcCwg

   Its off on the west side so people from the strip over have to travel a bit but let me tell you ts worth it. They share a parking lot with some other businesses that are not open at night so plenty of parking. Oh did I mentioned its next to an In and Out? 

   The restaurant has to seating areas the bar and the main dinning. The bar looks a little dark compared to the main dinning but looked inviting also. We sat in the main area, let me tell you its a bit of show with flames shooting up from almost every direction.. They ignite the fajitas table side with a nice shot of tequila.  I myself have not tried them but they look fantastic  and smell wonderful.

    The menu has lots of options and will cover just about any ones taste.  They start you off with chips beans and 2 salsas, one green ( which I preferred ) and one red (this on was a bit bitter to me ). But both tasty. 

    The staff is very efficient we did not have to ask for a thing. they kept us filled on chips and drinks and food was done in a timely manner and served very hot. The staff continued to check on us to make sure everything was on par. The food was fantastic, good flavor and you can tell not bag and box seasoning. Portion where large we had enough for a second meal at home the next day.

   Juan's has become part of my top five in Las Vegas closer to the top of that list. I can say with confidence I will be back many times in the near future.  

     If you get a chance to be in the area of Juan's I highly recommend you pay them a visit.. you wont be disapointed",r2wK-bxWTIRTupmbOcrEWg,1,0,5,t4PURjUbf4s0k78b6ErTcg

4919846,2018-03-26,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Oh my goodness!  Delicious carne fajitas!  I came here due to the reviews and it did not disappoint.  We arrived around 4:30 and there were already parties waiting to be seated.  Luckily my friend had arrived earlier and had already secured seating.  The service and food was great.  The carne fajitas were tender enough I could cut them with my fork.  The flour tortillas were very moist; sticking together in the tin foil(not a bad thing).   The salsas provided with the chips were delicious. 
 One of them looked like a roasted version and it was my favorite of the salsas presented.  The only item I would say that I ordered that I did not finish was the refried beans.  To me they were good, but on par with my other favorite Mexican restaurant beans.  You can feel the heat coming off the fajitas when they flambé them table side.  There were a couple of times when they would be serving other customers nearby and I was concerned that one of people in my party would have her hair ignited as she used a lot of hairspray and the flaming fajitas were very near her!  Luckily, she stayed flambé-free.  I wish the tables were not packed in so close together.  You have to maneuver carefully so as not to bump into people seated as you attempt to get to and from seating.  I realize they are popular so they pack in as much seating as they can, but it makes for feeling like you are also dining with others nearby.  I was too full to try a dessert; a good reason to come back.  There is covered patio dining.  The parking lot is challenging as the spaces are packed in like the seating inside the restaurant.  These 'challenges' however will not deter me from coming back.  I've been here once and anticipate returning.",Cfwvos6oFlDquGiI2Qy1gQ,0,0,5,PNFluwvqa2uV0C9WIrklJA

haha I have been wanting to try this place just because the pictures look so darn cool! Coming in I knew that we just HAD to try the flaming fajitas I mean if it's in the name of the restaurant then you should probably try the dish right? HAHA Walking into the place it's your typical family run Mexican joint nothing fancy but it was very clean and colorful. There is a full bar and patio area to the left and then the main dining room is comprised of both tables and booths.. I even think they have a little dance floor area. 

We ordered:
-Table-side made Guacamole: ($7.95) They make it exactly to your liking so if it tastes bad it is your own fault!
-Chicken & Beef Flaming Combo Fajitas for Two: ($25.95) I don't even like fajitas but these were so good. Good quality meat and you gotta love the little fire show that you get.. I love that the plate is indeed sizzling and pretty much stays sizzling so your meat/onions/peppers stay hot! 
-Combo comes with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, rice, beans or you can substitute the rice+beans for VEGGIES yay.. I love how they bring 2 separate plates of these instead of 1 to share between the 2 people! Combo also comes with a choice of corn or flour tortillas (6 total!)
-Complimentary Fideo soup which is like a tomato based soup with some noodles.. was a little salty for me but I still liked it!
-Complimentary Chips, Salsa & Bean Dip: The chips were mixed with the standard yellow chips and red and green chips.. served warm but not oily.. The salsa tasted fresh and was not too spicy and the bean dip was a little too salty for me but still tasty! 
On the menu it says the first round is on the house but that they charge after that.. They asked us if we wanted a refill and I said yes but they didn't charge us so maybe it's 1 per person? 

Awesome friendly service from all of the wait staff.. Food took a little bit longer than I had expected but I didn't really notice since I was too busy munching on chips.. I told Juan I found them through Yelp and he said Yelp has really helped them.. I definitely recommend trying this place out.. If you don't like fajitas they have a bunch of other items (no a la cart items though) & they have a daily HAPPY HOUR 3-7! 

HOT TIP: print this coupon before you go.. I forgot to print mine so they didn't accept it but oh well haha: https://mobileapp.moneymailer.com/IcfV2/getIcfImage.aspx?im=sat&o=7ACFE9EB-ADE7-4468-B58D-244231566823&di=&t=HOTPDF&p=F",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,14,9,4,L6nmxeS0zsFX-Tx_k-NVrw

Service - 5/5

Food
There are a variety of mexican selections from nachos, tacos, and burritos etc. I decided to try the Carne Asada Burrito which came in a huge portion with rice, beans (substitute with veggies) and guacamole. The burrito was very filling for the price, if you don't eat too much, two people could have shared the burrito. We ended up with a lot of to go.

Prices
The Burritos were all about $12.95. In my opinion, it was a little bit pricey for a casual lunch.

Service
The service was great. They also have complementary chips and salsa for us which was great for us when we were talking and waiting for the food to arrive.

Overall
The food was good and met my expectation. The price was a little bit pricey so unless you want to spend $10+ for a burrito, might want to consider ordering something else or sharing with a friend. Otherwise highly recommend for some tasty mexican food when you want to avoid the fast food places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle.",sCb9265DeUJLDIcvs03Owg,1,0,4,pry7Zj8MP257vxYdKuZqAA

Chips, and bean dip are good. Salsa is a bit mild, but has a good flavor.
Fajitas were bland, but flaming as advertised and somewhat burnt.
Rice was stone cold and they forgot the tortillas.
Corn tortillas are store bought just like the generic brand at Food4Less back in the day.

The service:
We were seated right away.
Our server seemed interested, but never checked on us until long after the food arrived.
The server delivering the food was in way too much of a hurry to even care to check that the order was even correct. So we waited until finally someone came over to check.
Then, they kept interrupting while we were trying to eat just to keep apologizing. 
I get it... you're sorry... are you trying to make me leave?

This place is new and there's not much decoration, but there's enough.

I love love love that they have a vegetarian section in their menu.  The menu has 6 different vegetarian plates.  I ordered the vegetarian fajitas with no sour cream or cheese and it came out flaming and on fire.  It was a pretty cool presentation of it.  The servings are big and I was full after eating 2 fajitas. My bf ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and he said it tasted good.  We both had leftovers to take home for tomorrow.  I also our love our bill and how it $20 for the both us!!  It's hard to eat out at restaurants nowadays for two people and pay $20 for the meal.

This place also has happy hour from 3pm-7pm.  If I can remember correctly, the happy hour menu has nachos, fajitas, and something else for like $5.  They also have alcohol for happy hour too.  I think this place will give Frank and Fina's and Lindo a run for their money.

The only problem is  this restaurants in the same parking lot with in and out burger. That makes parking measurable. So don't expect to rush in eat and leave. It's going take you 10 minutes to find a parking spot. But it's worth the wait. There's usually always a waiting list. Not very long but weekends tend to get busy as heck.

Our favorite thing to get here are the fajitas. The shrimp and steak combo hits the spot every time! Fajita platters come with a side of rice and beans as well as guacamole. Of course it wouldn't be called Juan's Flaming fajitas without the fire show that accompanies it. It's worth getting it every time just for that lol. Portions are huge and very shareable. 

Also worth noting is their happy hour everyday from 3-7. Plenty of food and drink options and a perfect place to just relax and unwind after a crazy week or day at work. It's a suitable place to have a get together with friends or to celebrate something. Reservations for large parties recommended obviously, they don't really like splitting checks but they'll work with you if you do it in groups.

Unfortunately, in every Mexican restaurant in which I've eaten, the fajitas cost twice as much as the combo plates, so I've been eating combos because I get 3 selections, and they fill me up.
What separates this place from the other Mexican restaurants are the fajitas.
They are reasonably priced, AND the portions are bigger than most other places, so for me, it's the best of both worlds.
I can't fault them for being on the other side of town, so I'll just eat my combos closer to home, and when I'm in the mood for fajitas, I'll drive the extra 15 or 20 minutes and go here. It's worth it!

A fun, lively atmosphere, solid food, and good service make this one of the better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. 
The food is delicious, seasoned and well prepared. 

I ordered the staple dish which is the fajitas, the flames was cool but I was more interested in how it tastes. 
The pork fajitas tasted excellent!! 
Succulent with a kick because I added jalapenos to it. 
The portion is enough for two people to eat and for $17 that's a bargain.
My friend got the chicharrones, I sampled a small amount and it was amazingly flavorful.

This place also great for happy hour, $5 margaritas and $3.50 for domestic beers. 

The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to make the experience fun.

My husband loves the chicken enchiladas with red sauce but my favorite is the Mulitas!!!! Although I prefer the lunch portion because it's a HUGE serving and I can rarely even finish one!! No worries, you can always take the leftovers to enjoy later at home!!!

I ordered the vegetarian fajitas, but was dismayed when I was offered a side of rice. As a precaution, I asked if the rice had any meat in it or if it was cooked in a meat based broth. Indeed, it is cooked in chicken stock. Okay, why, then, was I offered it if I ordered off the vegetarian section of the menu? 15 minutes later, I was brought a complimentary appetizer soup. Again asking the same question, I was told that this, too, had chicken stock in it. Hmm.

My suggestion to Juan: please tell your staff to not offer meat-based items to those guests who order off of the vegetarian section of the menu. Or, offer them, but indicate right then that they are made with meat-based ingredients. 

When my entree came out, the pan was barren and a couple veggies that were listed on the menu were not served. And the taste was nothing to get excited over. There are two other Mexican spots in town that have delicious veggie fajitas, and these ones just left me yearning for more.",5746cvWPCA6PNorA_cSEIg,2,3,2,mP1PsOv6k2mP6_VXKTSReQ

Once I walked in the I was greeted by the hostess and found my friends immediately. We ordered margaritas off the happy hour menu. They make a mean margarita! Then we had the fundito cheese to start along with warm tortilla chips and 2 types of homemade fresh salsa. The fundito cheese is basically a flavorful cheese melted on a hot ass grilled plate. It was DELICIOUS!

Once we placed our entrees, we were brought out a small cup of hot fiedo soup. It was the best fiedo soup I've ever had. 

We HAD to order fajitas at a Flamming fajita's restaurant! So I see the fajitas coming out way. Once they came to the table the waiter ignites the fajitas on FIRE! It smelled so good. My friend ordered the steak fajitas. The meat was so tender and had such an amazing seasoning on it. I recommend the steak or beef opinion. Then to finish off the night we ordered the fried ice cream.

Ambience: Fun but a little loud and smoky a bit during to the fajitas on fire. 

Quality: 10 out of 10. Great flavor and so tender!

Price: Very well priced. Between the 3 of us each of us paid $23 bucks

Service: The best. Very attentive without being too attentive.

The restaurant is huge and provides the perfect setting for a variety of purposes. There is a spacious dining room, perfect for families and date-nights.

We had to go with the flaming fajitas for two, and we decided to sample beef, chicken and pork. They are happy to split up the meat. We were told by two separate employees that the meats are marinated for 48-hours, and I believe them. All of the meats were tender, juicy and flavorful.

Location was in a strip mall and parking was a little tight but once we got into the restaurant it felt nice and cozy ... it  was split between a full bar section and full dinning with TVs and Mexican decor.
 Comfortable seating and when some restaurants are uncomfortable when packed, it was actually nice.

Menu was an excellent selection and a great variety of many options from tacos, enchiladas, burritos and chimichangas to some very ethnic meals.

We were greeted by the best waiter we have had in a long time, Christian was on the ball, had excellent recommendations and was so very friendly, he made us feel like fast friends and regulars.  

We ordered our typical order for a new place to make sure we like the menu, starting with a large Guacamole for the table that accompanied beans, salsa and tortilla chips, then for entrees, 
Chicken enchiladas suiza style, 
California burritos (one with steak the other with chicken), 
One taco al pastor 
and a kids meal with a cheese quesadilla and fries.
All meals came with Fideo soup and rice and beans
.
Ok, so now that I told you the order, let me tell you how amazing the food was.

Now, if you follow me or have read some of my reviews, you know that I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food and so I have to have my friends who love spice be my testers to make sure I can handle it.. sadly the salsa was a fire maker for me (see wimp) but I could handle the beans (ha ha ha) and the guacamole was delicious and fresh and the hint of lime was perfect.
Just make sure you don't eat too many of the chips (you will thank me later as the portions are huge) the fideo soup comes next,  and it was a very light, tomato and noodle broth that was a great pallet lightener from the guacamole and beans (and those that can handle the salsa )

Then the meals came out 
The Burritos were huge!!! We have enough left over for breakfast and lunch and the meat was so tender and juicy and full of fresh flavors.
The taco al pastor did not disappoint, we all tried each dish and couldn't say which was the best but I did love the chicken enchiladas with the corn tortillas and the creamy sauce, I could only eat half.

We did see many tables order the ""Flaming Fajitas"" which looked and smelled amazing, (another must try for our next stop).
We sadly did not have room for dessert but will be back and start with dessert then.

We were not disappointed at all with anything, the service was excellent from our waiter Christian (who we will ask for again!!) to the service help staff keeping our drinks topped and table cleared of empty plates..and the hostesses were on the ball to make sure we got a great table.

I always order the same thing which is a combo of a beef burrito and chicken taco. The burrito is flavorful and juicy. The chicken in the taco varies a little each time though and can either be juicy or quite dry, but when it is dry I just put salsa on it and it is fine. The staff is always super friendly and quick. 

I've seen at least two other restaurants fail in this location, but Juan's seems to know what they are doing because it is usually pretty packed.

I am giving it four stars rather than five because the drinks are very inconsistent. Sometimes the apocalypse drink tastes great and other times it has so much alcohol I can't even drink it.",Sqd6-nf0gOnMAkE5tPS-FA,0,1,4,2_3_CChJVy2aXc1V93W9nA

I have heard a number of good things about this place so we decided to try it out. During our visit I had the chimichanga and an appetizer. A number of people around us ordered the Flaming fajitas which seem to be very popular at the restaurant. I guess it was very popular because it was enough to feed two people off of one entree. When I got my chimichanga the carne asada was overcooked therefore making it dry and less flavorful. I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to this place but, I feel that if I do I should do as everyone else and order the Flaming fajitas. However, on the upside their Margaritas are amazing and they come in a multitude of flavors for you to try.

My husband and I share the Guadalajara special. It's carne asada covered in melted cheese with shrimp and scallops on top, sitting in a spicy white sauce. It is magical!  We've also split the carne asada a la tampiqueña and that is in a red sauce (not spicy at all) with shrimp on top and an enchilada on the side. Also, amazing.  The kids split the carne asada on the kids menu and it's a good amount of meat for a child entree.

So as we're driving into the parking lot of the Flaming Fajitas I quickly pulled out the Yelp app and checked some of the reviews. Norm K. recommended the flaming fajita so I decided then and there that that's what I'm getting. 

Immediately upon sitting down, a waitstaff came over to our table and laid down a plate of grilled onions and jalapenos, chips and salsa. I absolutely loved the grilled jalapenos and the bean dip that came with the chips - so much that I asked for extra servings of jalapenos! 

The flaming fajita serves two people. We shared that and had plenty of leftovers. Normally I find that beef served at Mexican restaurants are always on the tough side. But at Juan's Flaming Fajitas, the beef was very tender and flavorful. 

Over all it was a great experience! I will sure to come back to try out the flan, more grilled jalapenos and more flaming fajitas!",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,6,8,4,20Urg9Y7yypEksEBr47sPA

We were given a bowl of chips, salsa and refried beans. They have the usual fare: ceviche, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etcetera. Since they call themselves Flaming Fajitas, we got fajitas (and a few drinks). The service was friendly but not that efficient. 

Shrimp and Beef Fajitas:
You can get portions for 1 person or 2 people. Honestly, the portion for 2 was big enough for 3. You can get flour/ corn tortilla. You also get rice, guacamole, and salsa. I didn't really taste what was 5-star worthy about the food. To me, it was just ordinary and nothing different from all the fajitas I've had from other places. Ok, so they bring a cart by your table and you can watch your food go up in flames (well, not really) but that's about it. 3/5

Horchata:
When I'm at a Mexican restaurant, I have to have horchata. Their version was a cross between Mexican horchata (distinct cinnamon taste and sweet) and Spanish horchata (bland). 2.5/5

Mayan Apocalypse:
Amaretto, vodka, Citrus Cruzan, Midori, triple sec, sweet and sour, Southern Comfort and cranberry juice. Tasty but strong. This was the best thing I ordered. 4/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,6,3,_s689MOFxVrDxzu6FmVwPg

It just so happened that I had bookmarked Juan's a few days earlier and deciding to to put my faith in my fellow Yelpers, we headed over... And once again, my Yelp compadres, you did NOT disappoint.

As soon as my mother and I opened the door we were greeted. This is a large space, with a separate bar and patio area (which pleases me because I don't have to sit near children - no offense to you parents out there). We were seated at a table and were greeted within 15 seconds. Needless to say, the serve was on point all night. My iced tea was never more than half full the entire night.

Chips and salsa and bean dip came out immediately, quickly followed by grilled peppers and onions.Then we got a cup of the sopa de fidello.  Being the avocado lover I am, I had to gets my guacamole on; Juan's make theirs table side with fresh cilantro, tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions. You really can't mess up guac, it was a total win. Fresh to death. 

My mother and I wanted to see what these Flamingo Fajitas were all about. We ordered the fajitas for 2 (priced around $23), steak and chicken combo. It came with a side of rice and beans, as well as more guac (there is no such thing as too much guac), pico de gallo, and sour cream. The fajitas came out, our server set the tray done and lite that bad boy on FIY-AH! It was awesome. The fajitas were then placed on the table and we devoured them. The meat was perfectly season as were the onions and peppers. DELICIOSO!!! Some of the best fajitas I've ever had. This entree actually served three and we had left overs.

Some tips: Unless you're dangerously hungry, an entree should be enough for one person. We got an appetizer, entree and drink, and boy, were we filled. We ended up taking a lot of to-go.

The food itself is awesome though. What we had:

House Margaritas ($3.50 during happy hour from 3pm-7pm. Felt like a generous portion of tequila. I like.)
Juan's Sampler (Tasted great, but wow did it fill us up.)
Combo Beef & Shrimp Fajita for Two. (Great flavor and very tender. Comes with a good portion of sounds. They even light it on fire before they serve it, awesome.)

  Pulling up to the location sucks and the parking lot is a nightmare due to In N Out burger sharing the same parking lot with them so make sure you plan ahead. Inside the waiting area isn't that larger so patrons are forced to wait outside the restaurant with no added seating while you wait for your seat.

  Food is rather tasty and for what it is you'll be happy. The guacamole was super fresh, cold and seasoned well; as were the salsas they place on the table. Fajitas are really good and they're highly recommended.

 Service was decent but could use some more training on table maintenance to ensure you have a full beverage, clean plates and utensils.

5483790,2017-06-24,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"THE FOOD LIVES UP TO THE REVIEWS!

They are a long way from my house, almost 40 miles round trip. Which is why we waited so long to try it. Nothing fancy or like interior authentic, just really good food and plenty of it.

The chips and salsas are tasty but the grilled onions and jalapenos take the whole amuse bouche (sorry don't know the Spanish term) to another level. The Sopa de Fideo reminds me of Texas in the 60s.

The shrimp ceviche was so fresh tasting and a huge portion. I will need to tweak the Margarita Martini a little to get it where it needs to be but they have Bohemia; absolutely the best Mexican beer by far and harder and harder to find Outwest.

My GF ordered the Chile Relleno. Now a short discourse on that dish; it should be made with a Poblano chile that has been roasted and peeled NOT deep fried and peeled. An Anaheim or long green is too mild and somewhat insipid tasting, deep frying leaves the pepper al dente. Even though picadillo is also traditional filling, I prefer cheese with a thick but fluffy batter. A light red sauce and some queso leaves you with a 9 out of 10 relleno!

I had the green chile burrito enchilada style (an homage to the Jungle Club/El Jardin) and a cheese enchilada (because I am from Texas). The enchilada sauce was darker than I usually like, a little bitter but really tasted homemade and the enchilada was great!

Rice and beans are well above average and the service was excellent. $60.00 for 3 beers, a $9.95 Margarita, a huge appetizer, and 2 combination plates. Living La Vida Loca!",6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,0,0,5,ZDaKGnK-lhmLos8uk2qtrw

From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you walk in the vibe is quite nice. Definitely the look and feel of an authentic Mexican restaurant. Was a little disappointed that three TV's had the US Open on and not one had on FIFA Women's World Cup.

The place was semi-busy even though we got there when it first opened. They have Coke Zero too so that made the visit that much more awesome. Both Mom and I ordered the shredded chicken taco salad. They came back in less than ten minutes. Now that's fast! But, I have to admit I was skeptical with it coming back that fast. The server mentioned it was a simple process, that's why it was so fast. That didn't help matters for my skepticism.

It was actually pretty good. At first, the taste was not what I was used to. The chicken tasted a little funny, at first. But after a few bites, I couldn't stop eating! Overall it was pretty darn good. And they serve chips, refried beans, salsa, onions and jalepenos while you wait for your food. Good thing because I was starving!

I will definitely come back to try something else on the menu. Until then, four stars. Have to explore the menu. As far as customer service, it was extremely good. And they do not rush you to order or pay, for that matter. Great spot!",dnv5UpldAE6UITDcMleLVA,1,1,4,1BWiy8AcsHhzZyb5gdf9DQ

5512917,2017-05-19,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"By far the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas and I was born and raised here. This place blows Lindo Michoacán and Bonito Michoacán out of the water.

I ordered the lunch special and opted for the carne asada burrito and the chicken taco. I've never had carne asada this good. Tender, juicy, hot, with just the right amount of spice as to not overpower the meat. The chicken taco was also delicious and juicy. My wife chose the chile relleno and she loved it as well. She kept saying the word authentic (She was born in Mexico City) and that this tasted like a meal her mother and grandmother would make. The only downside to our visit was we got so full that we didn't save enough room for desert and we wish we should have because they looked amazing.

5517487,2016-03-07,2,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"After a nice afternoon strolling around Spring Mountain Park, I was feeling margarita-ish. My husband actually utilized yelp and Flaming Fajitas popped first on the list. Since we were in the vicinity...Flaming Fajitas it was.

Upon entering the hostess was on her way to seat a couple before us, but made sure to let us know she will be right with us. Right with us she was because we were immediately seated into a large booth that accomodated these minions perfectly. Booths were high enough so when the 2 year old decides to abruptly stand on his seat he isn't looking over into anyone's way or making eye contact with the people.behind us.

As soon as we were seated, it seemed like we were instantly served freshly fried house chips, salsas, and their bean dip. They also brought a small.plate of grilled jalapenos and onions. In which to my surprise the jalapenos were sweet and not spicy. I'm not accustomed to the non-spicy jalapenos. I thought it was a nice touch as that isn't something we typically see when eating at a Mexican restaurant as a house offering. She then brought out a couple cup size bowls of their fideo soup. Which was awesome because we I ended up feeding it to my 10month old...twas a good tranquilizer. Lol.

They serve their happy hour menu daily from 3-7pm. We came in close to 4 and the place was just filling up. It's a nice restaurant that offers a 21 year and over section, and even patio seating. 

I quickly found the house margarita on their happy hour menu. You can choose between a 12 of a 16oz for $4.95. I think the 12oz is for a dollar less. I didn't pay attention because I was looking for the largest size I could get at a deal. 

Honestly, I wasn't expecting their house margarita at a happy hour menu price to be potent. I kinda don't expect that anywhere. I will say that their house margarita was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it to taste better than alot of margaritas ive tried. I can't imagine what their top shelf margaritas taste like! I would have to return without the kids to find out. 2 16oz glasses of their margarita later, and I literally could of drank 4 more to probably catch a thorough buzz. It did, however, fulfill my taste buds for that margarita crave. Since I had the kids, coming from a quick hike, and bound for the mother-in-law's house...I suppose it was a good thing the drink wasn't doused in tequila or else I'd be heading to the in laws drunk. Not a good look. Lol.

Anyway, with the chips and salsas...they were super quick to refill our chips and dips. I love how they offer a nonspicy salsa for the kids. They certainly weren't afraid to serve those up. I even told my husband if they keep refilling our chips, bean dip, and salsa...I don't even think we'll order actual food. 

Which is kinda what happened. My kids just wanted taquitos, which to my excitement was on the happy hour menu. Lol. So I ordered one beef and one chicken in which each plate comes with 4 taquitos cut into halves. So in total...you have 8 pcs to pick at. I had to try them, and thought they were pretty good. There was certainly flavor in the meat.

The husband and I decided to share....we'll what else, a Flaming fajita. You have the option of ordering the Flaming fajita for one or two. Because I wasn't that hungry anymore after all the chips and salsas I had been chunking down...we opted for the one and decided to share that. 

Our orders did not take too long to come out. Perhaps I didn't notice because the chips and my margarita was distracting me from keeping time. When they bring out your fajitas....they literally flame it up infront of you. Our waiter, Hernan, fantastic by the way! He drizzled some kind of oil and lit that sucker on fire. And voila, Flaming fajita right before your eyes.

Overall, it's pretty standard. The service was wonderful and homely at the same time. Our waiter counted our 4 boys, plugged in the 5th child girl spill...the lady who kept cleaning our table off always took the time to stop and play with our 10month old the way an aunt would. When our 10month old would fuss she'd come by with crackers...so that was real thoughtful. 

We certainly had a great experience. The meats in the taquitos and the fajitas (husband chose pork, btw) were definitely moist and not bland at all. The service completely made it a 4 star experience. We would certainly come back.

Definitely recommend if you are in the vicinity. Kid and stroller friendly! Although, I'd say just leave the stroller in the car just so it isn't in the way, unless, they can seat you in booths that have lots of aisle space. Also, working buckles on their highchairs! Thank you for that!

P.S. Always check-in each visit as you get 15 percent off your bill. Shibby!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,4,3,4,ouNOBHM51Q4S_Y_eJECr8Q

The guac was amazing...no need to go for the table side-their house guac is so worth it. 
And even with all the amazing food, the best part about this place is the service. Few times have I experienced such excellent service in a restaurant. Everyone was attentive, polite and nice.

We ordered a alcoholic drink which was the Micheladas for about $8-9 can't remember?

For our final entree we got the fajitas for two combination of shrimp and steak. They do live for their restaurant name for ""flaming fajitas"" as it put on a fire show infront of our table as they served it. It came with your choice of rice and beans with pico de gallo for two. The meats were not bad but not the best I ever had. Overall the service was great always checking on us, and the environment has a good warm welcoming feeling.

5650929,2014-03-17,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"First of all, I would just like to point out the fact that this place has not been open very long. Maybe a year or two, max. I remember it being a barbecue place, with that said, it has more reviews than other Mexican restaurants I was looking to take my husband to for his birthday. So, to me it says something that a place that hasn't been established long has so many great reviews. 
Service- everyone there is very friendly and go above and beyond. Example- we brought our 17 month old and after seating him a lady brought out a drawing game for him to play with, this ended up being a lifesaver!!!!! I also saw her bring one out for an older boy, as well as the standard coloring paper and crayon. Everything came out very fast and was a pleasant experience. 
Food- the chips, bean dip and salsa were good! They literally bring it to you as your seated! The sopa de fideo is so tasty even my picky toddler gobbled it up!! 
My husband and I both ordered a 3 item plate, chicken tacos, beef flautas, and cheese enchilada. The beef was shredded and moist and oh so tasty, I didn't make it to my taco, but it was generous in size and my husband said his was great. The enchilada comes with red or green sauce, which to me can make or break the enchilada. The green sauce was very good and so was the red. The portions are HUGE so expect leftovers. We ordered the churro, even though the server recommended the fried ice cream, now I wish I had gotten that. The churro wasn't really anything special. Not something is get again, bit hey, I don't typically have room for dessert at a Mexican place, so it doesn't knock off any stars in my book.

I have had Juan's bookmarked for a long time, but haven't made it because it's on the other side of town from me. Well, the time finally came and my boyfriend and I were craving fajitas.

We waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is amazing because this place is HUGE and it was very busy. The staff is all super friendly and everyone we encountered was amazing.

They have a lot of options on the menu, beyond fajitas. We ordered the queso dip to start and went to town on the chips and salsa (big mistake!). We then decided to share the steak fajitas for 2, which is SO much food. I love the presentation - they wheel up a cart to your table and set your fajitas on fire. Pretty cool. Each person gets a plate with beans/rice and sour cream/guac. This was way too much food for us and we ended up taking quite a lot of it home.

I have a theory that there is always room for ice cream, so of course we ended the meal with fried ice cream.

1st visit: I had the chorizo tacos ... Excellent!
Rice and beans were good, too
I was especially impressed with the fideo soup ... very tasty broth.  I don't usually like fideo [Lindo you better step up your game]

Service was excellent ... I came after work, and got no grief for asking for a booth even though I was solo. 

I'll probably give 5 stars after trying a few more items!!

2nd visit: less than 1 week later, I'm here after a hard day's work. Happy Hour ... YAY!

Enjoyed the HH classic margarita on the rocks. Today, I tried the Juan's sampler which included taquitos, nachos & quesadilla with sour cream, and guac ... Again enough food for two meals.

Chips were great and not greasy, I love the complimentary grilled veggies and they even tossed in fideo soups for both my son and I (it usually only comes with an entree at other places and I ordered the app nachos and he the kid's meal). Service was really exceptional. Omar waited on us and there was also another lady that really took care of us. Drinks were filled without being asked and dirty plates were taken away without being noticed. I had mentioned it was my first time and Omar brought us churros at the end of the meal! 

Food was great and portions plenty. I ate about a third of my nachos and the kiddo didn't finish his kids meal either. I really digged the environment,  decor and murals too. Considering this used to be a no-frills BBQ place, they really amped up the Mexican theme. The flaming fajitas tableside really added to the fun of the whole place and we enjoyed being wowed when others ordered it.

I really like that they have a vegetarian menu, but last time we were in there, the waiter told us the fideo is made with chicken broth (I knew that) and so is the rice (I didn't know that). I mostly don't worry about stuff like broth when it comes to Mexican food, but I do think they need to either tell people or get it out of the rice, because it's a little misleading to call it vegetarian when it isn't. On the other hand, I did ask Juan once if they'd ever consider tofu or fake meat for the fajitas and he told me if I brought some in, they'd try it in ours.

That's a really nice touch that you don't see often as an alternative to rice and beans (they have refried and black beans). As everyone has said the chips and salsa/bean dip that arrive moments after you are seated are excellent. We heeded everyone's advice and held back so as not to spoil our dinner.

First pyromaniacs will love this place! The name ""Flaming Fajitas""  is well deserved and quite frankly and understatement. When they bring your Fajitas out the server ignites the dish and the flames shoot 3 to 4 feet into the air! 

The food was top notch fresh and flavorful. The only negative experience of the entire night was in relationship to their cheese dish I ordered to go along with my chips. It had to be cut with a knife and fork and couldn't be spooned up by a nacho chip. It had great flavor but I won't order it again as it was to much effort for chips and dip.

The wait staff was great, drinks were never more than half empty, the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip was similarly filled whenever they appeared low. We had one main waiter but he was getting help from everyone else on the staff and he was helping out the other waiters and their tables. It would appear they are a highly functional unit that wasn't worried about sharing their tables tips. Simply stated it was a true pleasure to dine here.

You could read that and guess it was a slow night but no, there was only one maybe two empty tables in the entire restaurant.

The flaming fajitas for one ($16) are definitely big enough for two and the one for two ($30) is easily big enough for 3. We had steak and chicken both were flavorful. They serve it and set it on fire at the table. Today we had three of us and each had three fajitas off the one for two. Delicious! I only wish it wasn't so far away. But definitely worth the drive!

5913650,2015-08-07,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"We were meeting some friends for lunch and we asked them for ideas. They chose Juan's and I am glad they did! Located just west of the 215 on Tropicana they are easy to find. We were immediately greeted and sat in a large booth. 

Within seconds our waitress arrived for our drink orders and chips, salsa, bean dip and grilled onions and peppers were delivered. The latter is a nice touch that I have not seen before. I went with the shrimp fajitas (lunch size) which comes with rice and beans and all the typical sides. Our friends ordered the queso fundido which was excellent. 

When the fajitas are delivered they set them on fire (hence the name Juan's ""flaming"" fajitas). The shrimp were cooked well and came with plenty of grilled green and yellow peppers and onions. The service throughout the meal was excellent. We were always offered more chips and salsa and our drinks were filled.

The only downside for me was the guac didn't seem like it was made fresh and the cast iron skillet had a lot of oil in it making it a little greasy. Besides that it was a great lunch.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,0,1,4,22vmtjaiTPuQkMs7NhaWDw
5915265,2013-05-10,2,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Quick tip: If the restaurant is called Juan's Flaming Fajitas, you should order the fajitas. 

We came here for our Cinco de Drunko dinner celebrations without any high hopes or expectations. All we were looking for was a Mexican restaurant near the house where we could partake in the national drunk day! Man we hit a jackpot with this joint!


We ordered flaming beef  fajitas (for one) and 3 combo plate (carne asada, pollo asada and carnitas) all tacos.

We got dinner and a show with the fajitas! I'm usually not a big fajita fan because every time I get them the meat is usually dry and rubbery.  Their meat was moist, juicy and full of flavor! (insert gay joke here) The peppers and onions were cooked just right as they still had a little snap to them. 

The tacos were decent in both taste and size but could not compare to the flaming fajitas! This place is called Juan's flaming fajitas not Juan's flaming tacos so order accordingly. If the tacos had the same pop as the fajitas this place would be a 5* without question. 

The freebie chips and dip were decent. They provided warm beans along with the salsa. One surprise was they provided grilled chilies and onions with the salsa! The chips were nothing special and probably of the bagged variety. 

Very friendly and attentive wait staff. We never had to ask for more chips and salsa or to have our water refilled. Our waiter was quick to point out that since it's cinco de drunko that the best bang for our alcoholic buck was the beer margarita since it was only $1 more than a standard margarita. SOLD! No need for up sell here my friend..

I think that we found a new place near our house to get our Mexican and margarita fix.!",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,2,3,4,d4fSDW0-TDUDmPj6uusoQA

5916766,2017-09-10,0,SVGApDPNdpFlEjwRQThCxA,"Top notch Mexican food just 20 minutes off the Vegas strip.  My lady and I were tired of the over priced and underwhelming options on the strip, so we swung out in the rental to hit a few desert parks on the outskirts on Vegas, hitting Juan's for dinner on the way back.

Juan's did not disappoint.  We sat in bar area, as main dining area was full.  Waiter took drink orders immediately after we sat, then after offered good suggestions on the menu items. Another waiter brought a big bowl of chips with 3 different salsa, some melted cheese, some beans, a plate of fried onion, and a plate of nice hot peppers, a nice damn little meal by itself.

An appetizer of ranchers taco's was 6 excellent tortillas fried crispy filled with shrimp.  We both had Jalisco style platters, she had steak Monterey style, loaded with peppers. onions, and monterey cheese, myself the chicken poblano, a deep, dark mole sauce with sesame seeds.  Both came with a cup of soup, beans and rice and were more than ample sized, that we had take out to drop in the cooler for a morning snack in the desert.

Fairly priced, superior customer service by the wait staff and great portions of real hearty Mexican food and non watered down drinks make this a must stop anytime I am in the Vegas area.",PySf4XWYZ0Luyj58YVQ2-Q,5,0,5,YaWiKY14pHF1fOlOFX4fDA

They turned away 30 customers. Unbelievable! What a poor decision by management to do that. We even asked to order ""to go"" and eat out on the patio so their precious servers wouldn't have to walk outside. The hostess staff was extremely rude and screamed at our group that they don't serve on the patio! Meanwhile, they do have one table out there getting service. Your service SUCKS! Keep turning away loyal customers and watch your sales dwindle.

Free chips, sauteed onions and peppers, and soup!

I ordered a taco salad... I asked for no rice and they offered to replace it with steamed veggies. I was very happy.

They were able to make a dirty martini and it was only $5.50 which is half of what I was expecting it to be (grey goose vodka too)

The service was very good. The workers were definitely hustling... Very quick to refill water, chips, and take away finished plates. 

The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my boyfriend asked for the steamed veggies too, but was given rice instead, and some of the chairs were cheap and looked like they belong in a cafeteria.",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,1,0,4,WUsh-de1JLcDy8hX9AOfBw

We arrived around noon and the place wasn't busy at all. We were seated in the bar area and given the full menu as well as their lunch specials after our drink orders were taken. The lunch specials were all very reasonably priced and they all include a soft drink or iced tea. I decided on the steak fajitas with corn tortillas and my mom chose the chicken mulitas. Both came out quickly and of course the fajitas were flaming as promised. The first attempt didn't work out, so the server had to go back get some more oil to stoke the fire, literally. Second times a charm and they were certainly flaming. The fajitas were good. I don't typically order fajitas, but these were solid. I wish they were a little less well done, but all the flavors were right and the portion was generous. I enjoyed the entire meal.

The best part about Juan's is the fabulous service.

My Margarita was great.  The Chicken Flaming Fajita and Cheese Quesadilla were both very good.  The Chimichanga was not as crunchy as we're used to (that's part of what we used to like about it) and we got the regular one, which tasted like they just boiled the chicken in water and was VERY bland and gross.  The chicken that came with the Fajita was grilled and delicious.  Our waiter suggested we should have gotten the Grilled Chicken (Pollo Asado) Chimichanga instead and then it would have tasted better - wish they had recommended it back when we asked what Pollo Asado was!
