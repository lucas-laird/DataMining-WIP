Get passed the velvet roped elevator, sky rocket paste the penthouse and open those doors to the weird east asian looking statues with too many arms etc, and you know its the House, just with lower lighting. 

$65 ($55 for members) buys you a 35 day dry aged (not in house), CAB (exclusively pre-Prime inspected like), Bone in, 16 oz Rib Eye steak, grilled to your order... Now I don't know what was weirder, the fact that this 16oz, clearly was mostly beef - because the bone was more like my thumb bone than the L or shank bone I'm used to, OR that because the bone was so small, that I was looking at a 16oz cut of meat that was Chicken Fried steak thickness... well I waste my words, the taste and the mouth experience was one of the best from any griller I've ever had.

If you're ordering the naturally slow dry aged meat, request there be no sauce accompanying it - even if their waiter described ""better than A1"" dressing... or even crusted, even though I love me some blue cheese on some beef... because of this, naturally speaking, grilled correctly, still purplish, that beef's texture is like smooth sashimi, butter knife slicing, only light salt and pepper touched, juicy, invigorating sweetness, to almost pierce your taste buds... and yes that was the meat sections - fat is room temperature butter smooth, taste locked in, the only topping you should have with each bite... I can still taste it.

Don't need support for this experience. Had them, don't remember them because of either the $20 beers per bottle, or the still vivid imagery of that meat. That's what she said.

COVER: $30 according to the website, but I'm not sure what we paid, because the bride-to-be booked in advance.

DRINKS: Because we booked in advance, we had our own tables and alcohol served there. Along with ice water! There were plenty of glasses for our 12+ group. Nice.

AMBIANCE: Zen buddha lounge theme entering the lounge. Pretty empty inside room with bar and plenty of couch seating. Walking pass that we eventually made it outside to experience a fascinate view of the strip. It was not overly crowded. People looked relaxed and enjoying the night. It was rather warm though, being outside and all. Wish there were misting units. The crowd was lacking younger college undergrads, sluts, and creepy grinding-feel-you-up guys - it was more of the young professionals place. Your IQ might even go up here.

OTHER: The manager (or equivalent) was attentive enough to introduce our party to our waitress. 

MUSIC: Lots of Top 40 Hits (there was no way to escape ""Moves like Jagger"" in Vegas) and highlights from decades past. The volume was fine where we were.

I actually had the pleasure of being a guest DJ in the Temple of Boom room.  So awesome to see a classy joint like Foundation Room support local Electronic Dance Music.

All the previous times I had been to Foundation Room I only knew of one DJ area which is the main area by the bar.  There you typically will hear Top 40 Club music which is perfect for the tourist crowd.  Just outside the main area there is a killer patio that has an amazing view of the Strip from high above the Mandalay Bay.  There is seating out there with bottle service available and it's a great spot to either grab a smoke or have a conversation without having to raise your voice.

But lets face it, I'm loving Temple Saturdays because of the Untz Untz Untz beats they bring.  There is an additional patio area that features some great House Music.  Pat Schoolastra is the resident out there and the man behind Nightlife Guru.  He has been in the game for a long time and knows his House music.  This is real House Music folks which you rarely get to see in a club on the Strip.

The Temple of Boom is the room I was able to guest DJ in and I was stoked to see this room being put to good use.  The music you find in this room is the cutting edge sounds of Electro and Dubstep.  I even had the pleasure of seeing Teenwolf Remix drop some Moombahton here which is the latest EDM genre to hit the scene.  Vegas is becoming the EDM capital of North America and it is nice to see Foundation Room embracing the local talent.

Few other things worth mentioning are all 3 areas have their own bar with reasonably priced drinks.  Also it is smooth entry as long as you're not wearing shorts, flip-flops, baseball caps, or sports attire.  Big props to Nightlife Guru for Temple Saturdays and much love to Foundation Room for giving them a shot.",QYagsl80cr0MAmFEu9SfRw,2,1,5,_F6wSijZteDpd2j9qqW1lg

There was a separate bartender for guests, as well as a DJ spinning for us.  The security was polite but firm with those who tried to wander over to our area.

The outside balcony needs no decoration because it towers over the strip and provides you with the most magnificent view in all of Vegas.  Seriously, it's amazing.

The restaurant also provided buffet style dinner for all the guests and the manager came out on more than one occasion to make sure that everything was going well.

We had been to the Cat House at the Luxor the night before for a welcome party and I know that the bride had a really bad experience with the management there, so she was extra appreciative of the attentiveness of the staff at the Foundation Room.

I can't speak for the prices of the drinks, since it was open bar for us.  However, if you're looking for cheap drinks, you're better off sticking to a college town than coming to Vegas.  Everything is expensive!

Chicken Flatbread - Tasty but way too much carbs for me, I'd like to try the duck breast next time.

Pinot Noir Mac Murray - a nice value wine. Not tannic and very smooth.

For me, the atmosphere of this place is what puts it over the top. The entire lounge has a very sophisticated Asian theme. The walls are upholstered in red and orange patches of mirrored Indian fabric. The doors are heavily carved and you'll see Buddhas here and there. The couches and chairs also provide comfortable places to hang out. The balcony offers an amazing view of the strip. 

The DJ was very good the night we were there. She played great music and kept the volume loud enough to keep the party going without making it so loud that you couldn't talk to the people around you. 

Surprisingly, the drinks are reasonably priced for a lounge like this. The bartender also remembered what all four folks in my party were drinking. I am sure she was thrilled we drank round after round between our arrival around 11:00 PM and when the joint closed down at 3:00 AM.

He was super nice and said he'd be there the rest of the night and to come find him when we want to get in. So.. we did, we left ROK over at the New York, which was pretty fun - and made our way back to Mandalay. Found the guy and he walked us to the door man and said 'have fun!' well, the door man - his name is Demitri, didn't even look up to smile he just asked for our ID's and 10$ ... it was about 12:30am by this time. I'm not a pre madonna but i'm also not going to pay 10$ at midnight when i left the club i was at before where i got in free. You ladies know how great it is in Vegas cause everywhere is free.. so we went back to find our guy and he walked us up to the door assuring Demitri it was OK that we get in for free. Demitri went off - telling us that no one is getting commission for the 3 of us to get in, and throwing it in our faces making it seem like we're robbing this guys job. I looked at the other guy who had been helping us and he was SO nice and again, assured Demitri it was OK for us to get in and he didn't care. I wish i could have gotten the nice guys name, but i was sure to get Demitri's on my way out because that is no way to treat people, especially ones who are paying a lot of money to stay at their hotel AND on alcohol once we got up there. 

Fortunately the view was worth the harassment but i can't say i'll ever recommend someone to go there unless they want the door man to put up a fight with them or pay to get in when you can get in for free pretty much anywhere else!",zrJaNzaDrvlBIO0gQA26ew,2,1,2,XUThgsdp5sva30ySNmlgPg

Once you are through soaking it in, the Foundation room can be a pretty happening place depending on the day.  We were lucky enough to be invited to a vendor party in a private room that was absolutely beserk and spilled over into the main room once the event ended.

I came here several nights ago for dinner, and it was ok, nothing great. The food isn't bad, but compared to the price, it's not worth it. I guess if you want a quieter place to dine, and you're a member, then sure, it's ok.

I ordered the horseradish crusted, rib-eye steak. Again, it was good, but not great. I would have much rather have had a steak from Mesa Grill.

For sides we ordered the mashed potatoes, and something else, which I can't even remember, that's how insignificant it was.

The service and ambiance are great though. As everyone has pointed out, the view is spectacular. I'd come back for drinks at this particular Foundation Room, and skip the restaurant. Come to think of it, you can just go to Mix, at THE Hotel for drinks and an even better view.

A coworker of ours put us on the guest list, so not sure how hard/expensive that would have been to get in. I was a little put off at first by the crowd... wasn't expecting an older, 40ish type crowd, and the area seemed small since there were a few private tables/sections that took up half the space. The view from the balcony was amazing, but too cold for us to stay out there to hang out. Claudeen worked her charm and we were able to walk around and get a tour of the back/VIP rooms thanks also to our boy Ralph. During the tour, we proceeded to meet some friendly brothers and their friends that just wanted to dance and have fun. So of course, we obliged and had a great time... lots of hilarious pictures ensued. We also randomly met Dean Roland from Collective Soul, nice guy and his friends were funny and just enjoying themselves. Unfortunately, I'm not a social butterfly, so I couldn't keep up.

The other nice thing was that the place was carpeted, so wearing heels all night wasn't as painful with the padding. Music was okay, we usually prefer hip hop, but we had a great time either way and got to request a few songs. Most of the guys we met that night were super nice and gentlemenly. I noticed though it seemed like there were more guys than girls. And at least it didn't feel like they were staring.

We got a round of drinks and headed to the balcony to check out the view.  Just as we stepped in to the balcony I got stuck in the foot with something and grabbed my husband.  It was a piece of broken glass that's cut my foot.  Ouch.  I looked down at my feet it was blood all over my sandals.  A bouncer popped up out of nowhere and checked me.  He called for a
""Medic"" on his headset.  He had to call 2 more times for the ""Medic"" bye that time it was blood dripping on the floor.  The medic came took my over to a take a seat.  Bless his soul he wasn't prepared for the amount of blood that my foot was dripping.  He had one bandaid, a thing of saline, and a pack of gauze.  The ""Medic's""hand was shaking.  I looked at my best friend who is in the medical field to care for my wound.  She pressed on my food to stop the bleeding and to make sure it wasn't any glass in my foot.  She told Bouncer with Gloves, sorry I meant to say the ""Medic"" to get more gauze and more bandaids.  She cleaned the wound with the saline and bandaged me up.  
The Medic got us a round of drinks for the inconvenience but never filled out a incident report.  Later that evening we stopped at our hotels security to get more band aids and gauze because the wound was oozing.  They asked us why we never took pics or had a incident report filled out.  To be honest we didn't think about it.  My foot hurt and was sore for the rest of our visit which totally sucks since you have to walk a mile inmost hotels in Vegas just to get a coffee.  
Now that I am home I was still having issues with my foot so I went to my Dr.  she cleaned the wound which does look like it was getting infected, she gave me antibiotics and a lovely tetanus shot!!!    She asked me why I didn't take pictures of the glass, my foot when it happened and all the blood and my answer was it was all just a accident by irresponsible drinks. They dropped their glass and never told security to clean it up.  The other reason was we were more concerned with stopping the bleeding.  My girlfriends husband was feeling faint since he doesn't do well with blood.  The bleeding was so bad that the white on my sandals were covered in blood.

There is a special elevator close to the hotel entrance to access the place. We visited the Foundation Room as a group and invested in bottle service (4 bottles) which I had arranged the previous week. The executive VIP host who helped me set up our party was terrific. He was very friendly, accommodating and did a great job explaining all the details around ensuring our event was super high quality and fun for our group. I didn't feel like their only intention was to take as much cash from me as possible, they seemed legitimately interested in ensuring we had a great time at a reasonable cost. Cheers to social media...they all understand the power of the online review.

The Foundation Room offers a large outside terrace overlooking the strip from a distance, probably 1 of the top 3 views of Las Vegas. During our event, we were assigned our private server and bouncer. Our server was very precise, respectful and kept the drinks flowing, even during some of the group craziness. She wasn't over pouring and being reckless with our high-priced booze. Our bouncer at one point removed some guy from our area (who was trying to sneak drinks from our bottles). He was also available to escort girls in our party to restrooms and basically was available to take care of any unique needs beyond serving drinks. He also ensured one of the girls in our party was ok after she started getting a bit too wasted. He was respectful and handled the situation appropriately without dragging me or the group down.

I'm used to bottle service in Vegas being not as accommodating and certainly more expensive. I'd guess I paid about 30% less than I would have at one of the night clubs (which was not our preference anyway). Our group did want to dance, but we also wanted to relax, be able to speak to each other without yelling and be in an environment that we felt was exclusive and friendly. Our table area had a dance podium in front of it, so when the venue dancers used it, it was somewhat exclusive to us.

I've also been to the Foundation Room with my wife only, without the larger group. Still felt exclusive, exotic, warm and sexy (sounds more appropriate than ""romantic"") Highly recommend this place.

Like the Foundation Rooms in New Orleans and Las Angeles - the decor is lots of dark wood and comfy places to lounge.  What is different is the view.  They have a wonderful outdoor patio you can access off the lounge or the restaurant.  The restaurant is very subdued with dark wall panels, high ceilings and large windows.  It has a very elegant atmosphere.

The lounge has a dark wood bar with comfortable stools and you can look out to the patio and the great view.  There are several rooms you can relax in, have a private diner, or wander out on the patio to enjoy the view.  The patios are the one place you are allowed to smoke...which can dampen the enjoyment for non-smokers.

They have a good wine list but fairly limited to what they serve by the glass in the lounge.  The drinks are tasty and are the price of most upscale lounges in Vegas.  

We have never gotten a bad meal in the restaurant.  You can linger over your meal, because they never seem to be trying to hurry you out and I don't remember the restaurant ever being crowded.  But bring your credit card or winnings from the tables because it is not a cheap meal.

We have also gotten appetizers at the bar.  Nice spot to start out your evening ...especially during the work week because it won't be packed.  And you can't beat the view.

If looking for an interesting spot to share drinks and conversation with friends, enjoy a million dollar view of Vegas and maybe catch a live music performance - this is it.

As the guest list line was longer than the general admission line, we hopped into the general admission line instead. With less than a 5 minute wait, our names were checked off the list and we were on our way upstairs. Hint: Being on the guest list doesn't mean you won't wait in line - and possibly a longer than if you weren't on the list. Tip: If you are on the guest list and that line is crazy long, just get in the regular line.

Upon making our way upstairs, we wanted to see the view. The little outdoor area with the view is quite small and way crowded. Perhaps there are some other better areas to the Foundation Room, but we didn't see those. We just saw the little rectangle of a balcony. The music was thunderous, of course. There were reserved / VIP booths along the wall and the ledge. It was a complete wall of people standing between the wall and the ledge. You can't see, let alone appreciate, the view unless you have a VIP booth along the ledge. The standing crowd inhibits all sight of the view.

Needless to say, we found it to be a frustrating and not enjoyable experience. Again, perhaps there's entire areas of FR we missed that are nice and pleasant and have a great view.

Luckily I had a connection to get us on the list, so can't really comment on cover costs.  The bouncer at the bottom of the elevators was cool to us and we got in pretty quickly.

FR was actually smaller than I thought it was going to be, but then again I think there may have been some other (private?) rooms that just weren't open the night we went.  The VIP couch areas take up a good amount of floor space in the main bar area (especially if people are dancing in the free space).  But the view is great from the balcony and the drinks aren't too expensive.

For the most part I enjoyed the crowd.  A couple of groups in the VIP couch areas who seemed to be having fun and were an attractive crowd.  A handful of cougars on the prowl, and your complement of single guys and gals with their eyes constantly scanning the crowd.

The decor is very Zen with a large Buddha guarding the entrance to the club once you step out of the elevators and some great wall decorations.  The combination of serene decorations and mellow music made for an enjoyable couple of hours.

I'd recommend people to check it out.  It's not wild and crazy like some other Vegas clubs, but that's part of the reason why I liked it.   More low key, mellow, loungey, than your typical over-the-top Vegas style club.

After getting out of the elevator, I couldn't help but gag at the decor in this place. It screams old boys club (which is what it was originally). However, for the amount of hype this place builds, I was hoping for such much more! Not some tacky, gaudy restaurant. 

And I have a pretty sensitive nose, so maybe it's just me but the place has a very distinct scent to it... which I'm not sure I was loving.

We're seated right away -- mostly because the entire place was dead with the exception of one other party. Servers were prompt and helpful with our every need. Then again, for the price I was about to pay for dinner... I expected no less.

I ordered the baked scallops while my boyfriend ordered a new york strip steak. We both decided to share the yukon mashed potatoes. 

I'm salivating at the thought of the juicy baked scallops and can't wait for them to come. I'm expecting something savory and delicious. I wanted something that would stamp out my hunger and leave me satisfied.

When they came, I was obviously excited.

HOLY SALT! I nearly spit my first bite of the scallop out of my mouth. I couldn't believe how salty it was. YUCK.

Boyfriend's steak looks delicious. I wish I had ordered it. He obviously chows down with no issues.

Our yukon mashed turned into another salty side platter of herb baked potatoes. Not sure how yukon mash turns into baked potatos, but okay. They were salty as hell.

All in all, food was NOT worth it. 

The view? FABULOUS. 

Overall, never going again. You can get much better meals and experiences at other Vegas restaurants.",nvy_iLAKfNoMHPBEj8QhFw,0,0,2,ew7DZnRz47njTqe0vu8HCA

Maybe it was the sad go-go dancer, dancing up a storm while nobody paid attention, or maybe it was that there was nobody really around to pay attention. 

I dunno.

I just know that it seemed really desperate and really boring while we were there.  I'm sure that on nights where it's packed, it's a much better atmosphere, but, damn.  It wasn't on that night.

Restaurant:
They changed their menu from the last time I dined here. It is now based around small plates and appetizer size foods. A la carte meats and cheeses, oysters, and other treats. They have a few large items that I have not tried yet. My wife and my dining plan is usually to try a bunch of small stuff and share.

In an age where restaurants seem to be cutting back on the size and diversity of bread baskets, this one is wonderful. Four types of bread and a trio of butter. The short rib with spicy kimchi is unique and tasty, and spicy. The chicken lollypops are chicken wings elevated with two delicious sauces. The pork and prawns which lacks any discription on the menu is two large bacon wrapped shrimp and a slaw. Can't really go wrong with something wrapped in bacon.

My only real problem is that my oysters seemed to be shucked with a hammer. They were very fresh and tasty, but there were substantial shell bits in most of them. On a related note, I was at a party in the lounge that was serving food and the shrimp pot pie I had (although very good, and in the cutest little cast iron skillet you've ever seen) was also full of shell. Keep an eye on the prep work guys and I'll be happy.

The Club:
I'm kind of like an old person here. I don't go here late very often when the DJ is going and it has more of a club feel. It is a great place for the view and it's nice to bring people from out of town up here for a little bit different experience. Most of the time the bartenders are very cold and not too worried about you. The drinks are a couple dollars more than downstairs at Mandalay Bay, but the 20% off member discount helps. They also hand out 2-for-1 coupons in the casino that are good for well drinks and domestic beers that help out with the cost as well.",ZWTR80zMUGlfcYMjTSQm0A,3,1,4,XCEAWf8tC6TF9mIRjOEf-Q

Soft music played in the background as we sat down on cushy-comfy couches.  Our friend had formed a friendship with the mater'd and we were treated like royalty.  We enjoyed two bottles of their newest champagne (served in wine glasses with ice and mint leaves), enjoyed the tiger shrimp wrapped with bacon as a appetizer, and took photos.  For dinner I had the roasted chicken while hubby enjoyed rack of lamb.  It was his first time eating it and said it was amazing.  I tried a bite and it was!  Our friends ordered several sides including truffled mac n cheese, which I tried and enjoyed.  I was very satisfied with the meal.

It was the first stop on the list, and the best part about it is the view.  Amazing balcony view from the top of Mandalay Bay.  That definitely makes it worth the trip.  However, do NOT think you will be dancing here.  They do not allow cameras in the club itself.  It is very dark, with dark wood panelling and dark wood bar.  Dimly lit.  There are lounging chairs and couches, and two go-go dancers that dance on small platforms.  Although we enjoyed a good drink, we witnessed that security would approach any customers that were dancing and ask them to stop.  Only the go-go dancers can dance.  The customers just stand around, or lounge on couches.  So, go, take some great pictures outside on the balcony, and then leave.

LOCATION: There are no signs directing you to the Foundation Room as you're walking around in Mandalay Bay. Elevators are located on the backside of the guest elevators and right in front of the escalators that lead you to the pool/beach.

INSIDE: You take an elevator to go to the top and once you get there, the place is pretty dark. The restrooms are right next to the elevator. There's a section for dining in, but we just walked over to where the bar and balcony was. There was plenty of seating (I think) but the place was so packed, we didn't want to stay. Can get a little claustrophobic if there's a crowd.

BALCONY: View is pretty nice! Smoking is allowed outside on the balcony, so if you're not comfortable with that - don't stay out there so long.

We took in the views, took some pics and headed back down. Maybe we'll come back and check this place out again another time?",0zZk826vbqYCx_yV8WGvtw,6,1,3,iQ9Pc4MUSIM_enWTKiXSGw

The place is definitely cozy and welcoming, and while I'm not sure of the guestlist situation, the fellow at the elevator just nodded at us as our group announced itself and ushered us right in.  

As it was the middle of the week, the place was pretty calm and not overrun by pretentious twits, which was just perfect by us.  Good drinks with an excellent selection, and a bartender that also sold us cigarettes and cigars made it very difficult to want to leave.

Okay..that's subjective, I've only covered three continents out of six. The seventh doesn't count for obvious reasons unless I'm trying to break some sort of record. Top Gear South Pole, anyone?

This lounge knows classy. The management and the founders behind this place know what's tasteful in terms of decor, and they know what kind of crowd they're catering to. 

When you walk in right after exiting the elevator to get up here (rooftop of Mandalay Bay. If you watch a lot of music vids, you've seen this place) you'll notice a very impressive looking Buddha statue. Ask any of the hostesses about the story behind it!

The cocktails here are made VERY well. There are go-go dancers in the center room, and you can land a table or a private room with advanced reservations. They also have an awesome cigar menu at lounge prices (a little more expensive than a typical cigar lounge).

Probably the most breathtaking part of this lounge aside the decor and the vibe of the place is the view you get here that you just can't get anywhere else on the strip. Walk outside to the patio where you can see the entire strip and its lights at night from the south end all the way up to the north.

I've made this lounge my go-to spot for all my friends and our Saturday nights.

Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. The promoter told us that all girls would get in for free and will receive drink tickets. He also mentioned that the boys will have to pay $20 but not to worry as it comes with free drinks - lies!!! Our boys paid their fee but never got free drinks. 

Ambiance: lively and poppin but crowded. It was set up like a lounge but since there was no way you could sit unless you paid at least $800 you have no other option than to stand on the walk path. People were dancing on the pathways so it was like a club with not dance floor. The outside area is the same. There's a nice view but good luck squeezing in there to take a picture of the view. 

Drinks: the drink tickets were for a bubbly champagne or a vodka drink. They serve it in a small cup with lots of ice. I was surprised as to how much vodka flavor was in my cranberry vodka. Others would probably feel like, "" yes they hooked it up with the alcohol"" but It didn't taste right. Drinks were ridiculously priced.

No video recording... No video... No recording... No 15-second Instagram footage. FYI. I kept getting caught trying to film my friends and I having fun. That rule was a bit odd.

Can someone explain to me why the security/bouncer guys have to get my attention by lightly pinching the inner part of my arm?! Gross! Please don't touch me. Tap my shoulders. That would have been more respectful.

Overall, not my scene. If I wanted to go to a club I would go to a club... Not a lounge such as this... But I wanted to go to a lounge... and this lounge did not meet my expectations.

The view is stunning, it adds even more sex appeal to this beautiful lounge. During the winter heat lamps are provided but who needs those when this environment is perfect for getting warmth through drinks and body heat ;-)  

I've been coming to Foundation Room for many moons now since I'm anti club kid but I need to occasionally entertain out of town guests. Foundation Room is owned by House of Blues and use to be available to members only. I felt privileged when I was invited to join the events in the past but now this gorgeous lounge is available to all to enjoy. I almost dare to say it's a unintentional best kept secret in Las Vegas. The crowd isn't young 20 something's, it's more 30-40's so you won't see little ladies having their hair held back in the bathrooms because drinking is a new thing to them. The dark romantic ambiance plays well with my soul, way more than the uber mega clubs on the strip. 

It's not just a lounge mind you there is a fine restaurant here also. I really won't touch much onto that because it was years ago when I ate there and my memory is fairly faded about that night. I do remember drinks were abundant, stiff and I was all smiles and sunshine that night. I will just assume my food pleased me other wise the libations made the food extremely palatable.

Despite $5 waters and $9 ""cheap"" beers, the music makes it worth it.  Admission is expensive, and unless you're either a) female - and can get $10 passes wandering through Mandalay Bay, or b) willing to grease the hand of the doorman (then he may give you his card and you can get this $10 priority admission for your local crew), you'll likely be asked for $30 at the door.

As a ""local lady"" in this town I can generally get into most clubs for free, but it's worth it to me to pay the $10 and go to the Foundation Room for our girls nights out.   The most compelling reason is THE MUSIC.  The DJ generally plays a great mix of hip hop, dance, and rock music from the 80's through today.  The variation is welcome compared to most clubs only playing the most contemporary music (regardless of the quality).  Second, the volume of the music keeps bringing us back!  You can actually hear each other talk in this club!  There's no doubt the volume is loud enough to get lost in if you wish, but even inside you can still understand what people are saying to you and ask your friends what they'd like to drink and hear the responses.  Plus, if you want a break from the boom-boom, just step outside on the balcony.  That brings us to the third plus, the balcony!  A smashing view of the Las Vegas Strip from the southern tip looking north.  If you're lucky enough to be there on a stormy summer night I highly recommend watching the lightening float across the clouds and crash on the surrounding Vegas mountains.

Of course there are drawbacks.  Drinks are expensive, and if you're not a rich looking guy the female bartenders will mostly ignore you.  The crowd seems to vary from spry young things to middle age male gawkers.  But, it's Vegas, what do you expect?  I've never found a lack of interesting people to talk to, and I welcome that I can actually hear what they're saying while booty-shakin' to some hip-hop that brings back college memories.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,6,4,4,vqTz_lJ3mUHWWzgn1wrU-w

The lighting is dark, the walls are all upholstered with patchwork, and you're met with an enormous glowing Buddha. 

The room for the reception wasn't ready yet so we waited in the bar. The server's came around asking for drink orders and they were very nice and helpful. Shortly after we were directed to the room where the reception was. Similarly to the bar, the reception room had an amazing view of the Las Vegas strip and the mountains that lie behind. We were served light hors d'oeuvres- things such as baked brie with crusty bread, a vegetable platter, vegetarian sushi, hummus, and chocolate covered strawberries. A server walked around with bruschetta, ahi tuna, and duck skewers. All of the food was very good!

If you're that worried about what you pay for a drink then keep playing your 5 cents per hand video poker and let the casino drink girls bring your beverages for tips. 

The view is great! Because Mandalay is at the far end of the strip, you get a full view of the casinos and lights, including the airport. (If you feel daring, you could always try and claim one of the private jets is yours in a pickup line).  All in all, the place is a more private area.  Yes, on Monday nights the public can get access but otherwise it is for members only.

If you have the opportunity to go, it's worth the trip and the price of a few cocktails. Just don't show up in shorts and tennis shoes or they won't let you in.",Ei6VvLWS8jwknKmHSGLoUQ,0,0,3,ygDVmSCaant5GB2Qpb8FoQ

On 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay you will find this hip & elegant lounge aka ""The Foundation Room"" ! I couldn't have selected a better place to be my 1,000th review on Yelp! Whoo hooo! 

The Foundation Room has been from what I've heard an on and off members only establishment, however when I clarified if this was still something in place with the hostess at the entry of the club she explained that ""non-members"" are granted entry only if they have reservations for the Dining Room. Also, for the ""non-members"" If you are interested in going beyond the Dining Room and into the lounge area you may do so, just as long as it's after 10:00 PM. 

Prior to my most recent visit I've had the pleasure of taking one hell of an elevator ride up here a time or two before. Each time I've visited this place there has always been a memorable moment created! My girlfriends were visiting from Atlanta, GA and brought me along on one of those wild and crazy Nightclub Crawl Party buses and this place was on the list! Go figure with that though because the spot to meet was actually at Mandalay Bay, so of course we would kick off the night of fun here! 

After waiting not too long in the VIP line, we were finally granted access and went through the normal security check and lead to the elevators. It's almost like a nirvana when you take a step off the elevator into this hidden gem of a lounge. Dimly lit, you will find one center bar that has some of the most nice bartenders I've ran across in Las Vegas. The drinks are priced at the normal of what cocktails are usually in Las Vegas so no complaints on that. They have something called ""Nibbles & Sips"" hour Sun-Thu from 5:00PM-8:00PM so I encourage you to check that out. Music has always been great so I'm sure you can find something that will be played you can hit the dance floor to. 

Last but not least! Make sure you take a step out onto the wrap around balcony and soak up that incredible view of Las Vegas! This view actually in my opinion has to be one of the best if not the best that the city can offer you. I'm sure there will be plenty more opportunities that I will return and I can't wait!

Upon check in at the hostess stand we were escorted to the lounge and would be called when our table was ready. A peak into the restaurant reveled many available tables but maybe their policy is not to seat guests early and also help increase the lounge beverage business. The lounge has plenty of interesting art and a great view of the strip from the outdoor patio. At 6:30 the hostess escorted to our dining room table. The dining room also has an patio with an outdoor bar. Live music begins later in the evening.
The artwork in the dining  room is also interesting. However, the room is tired and needs fresh paint and cleaning. Dust is obvious on some of the light fixtures and the light fixtures above the wall art could be better positioned so they are not skewed.
Our server was Amanda and she was assisted by Otto. Both  were attentive and knowledgeable of the menu Otto was especially talkative and entertaining. 
Both of us ordered from the Restaurant week menu. 
The crab cake appetizer consisted of two large patties topped by apple fennel slaw and surrounded by an apple mustard sauce. This dish was light and flavorful. The slaw added a nice crunch.
The 6 oz Filet of Beef was tender and cooked as requested. The baby carrots and cippolini onions were a perfect complement.
The Shrimp Thai Curry main course was described as spicy by our server. It delivered fantastic flavor with a pronounced amount of heat. The large shrimp were served in curry along with eggplant, cilantro, mint and Honshimeji mushrooms. A separate bowl contained a large portion of jasmine rice. I highly recommend this dish if you enjoy a spicy experience.

The molten chocolate cake includes two chocolate ganache truffles, and two raspberries. The truffles just melt in your mouth. The cake could have had more molten chocolate.
The calvados apple bread pudding with vanilla Ice Cream included a side container of warm sticky pecan caramel. When poured over the pudding it just melted the Ice Cream and soaked into the pudding. Just delicious and very rich.

The Foundation Room is more a 4 star than 3 because the food and service out shine the need to freshen up the space. Refurbishing would help improve the the overall experience.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,4,aDgWA_30b-VPqAkCp6fH4g

For my birthday this year, my boyfriend wanted to surprise me by taking me out to dinner somewhere special and he would not tell me where. Apparently, after sifting through menus all over town, he settled on Foundation Room.

While I'm told the main course menu is delicious, we just stuck to eating tapas style and ordered a bunch of appetizers to split. Of those, the Fresh Shucked Oysters and the Duck Confit are of particular note. The oysters were fresh and not overpowering. The Duck Confit is pretty much one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was so soft, flavourful and just melted in my mouth.

The service was impeccable and our waiter was one of the best I have ever had in my life. He was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, especially the wine list. I really appreciated how ""real"" he was with us. Usually when you are torn between two wines, a waiter will upsell you to another more expensive bottle, or try to sway you to choose the pricier of the two. Our didn't. He told us his honest, unbiased opinion of both bottles to help us make a decision without any underlying motive. That is always appreciated. 

To top off a fantastic meal, the restaurant gave us a wonderful plate of complimentary desserts for my birthday and even gave us a deal on the check! It was one of the best dining experiences I have had in this city and I will definitely be returning soon!",ZD3_a2-bcugIQfh_0rWqIQ,7,1,5,VagMushr-zyjSC8u_x3p5w

The music is nice, but definitely not something you would dance to. A lounge in the truest meaning of the word, there are several cozy sofas and fireplaces to lounge around, along with a balcony with a lovely view. They have some private rooms as well.. Mostly an older crowd, and a great place to meet a friend or colleague for a few drinks.

First off, I have to say ""WHAT A VIEW!""  and second, ""WHAT A VIEW"" . . wow, unparalleled unrestricted  views of the Las Vegas Strip that cannot be beat.  

The Foundation Room is kind of hard to find.  You have to take a super secret velvet roped elevator to the top.  When you step off that elevator, you are transported to a very sophisticated  ultra lounge with middle eastern/asian decor. Its dark and serene.  Plush couches/seating surrounds you.  Step up to the bar and get your hands on a drink, then head out the doors behind the bar to the patio to soak in the view.  After enjoying a drink outside, head back in to the five star restaurant for some fantastic dining. 

Your waiter will start you off with a complementary bread basket with a broad assortment of breads, even a soft pretzel type of bread which I really enjoyed.
We ordered some appetizers: Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, Oysters on the Half Shell, Cheese and Charcuterie tray.

Now for the entrees, we ordered Osso Bucco, Horseradish Crusted Steak, Lamb, Braised Mushrooms, Truffle Macaroni and Cheese and Grilled Asparagus, all of which were to die for.   Dessert had some interesting choices: Lemon Olive Oil Cake, Apple Bread Pudding and Molten Chocolate cake.

This place is located inside The Mandalay Bay hotel and you can conveniently park at their parking lot (Paid!). The Foundation Room is a rather small place that is divided into an outdoor/balcony area on one side and a club/lounge area on the other side which makes it pretty interesting. Unfortunately, there is very little room to dance so don't count too much on that... 

The best thing about this place is definitely the view. If you stand outside, you can get a view of the whole strip.

The drinks are good and service is ok, except when the place gets very crowded late in the evening. It can be hard to get drinks then. One good thing about this place is the decor/atmosphere which makes it pretty unique in Las Vegas. Expect to pay $12 for most drinks event though girls can sometimes get free drinks tickets.

Mostly because of the decor..We are Indian and didn't like how there were statues of Hindu Gods used as decoration. I myself am not very religious but I still have respect for others beliefs specially since some members of my family are Hindu. You wouldn't use Jesus Christ on a cross as decoration in a bar or club, then why have Hindu gods in a place that serves alcohol, plays loud uncensored music, and has scantily clad women walking around? I want people to understand its not the music, girls, or alcohol im against, This is Vegas and all of that is acceptable here and I always have fun with all three. BUT religious decor just doesn't belong in a bar, lounge or club. I liked the other decor but we all felt Mandalay Bay should have held out on the statues of gods and deities. Some of the statues we saw are similar, if not the same as, ones we see in Hindu temples, so to see them in a setting like this was weird and offensive.

Later in the evening we found out that there were other rooms.  We then ended up going to the farther room (if I had turn right) which seems brighter in lighting and better crowd.

I am digging this place. The night we went it was a Sunday night and the place was full but not overly so that you can't walk around the place. Lots of comfy leather chairs to lounge on, good music and a full bar that won't keep you waiting. The inside has dark and rich tones, lots of framed art- from the odd to the strange, decorated ceilings and lots of things that catch your attention. I like that they have some private rooms that is ornately decorated- seems to be a harem styled room-swags of cloth, rich decoration and lots of gold and reds. That night they had a burlesque performer...very fitting for this place. 

The main attraction here is the view and the lights of Sin City. The view is spectacular...amazing. I heard the Foundation Room seems to be members only but once in a while, they do open this place to the public. If you can, go...it is nice change from the big clubs on the strip and the views will have you appreciating vegas a lil bit more.",v6J_GeMsl6XTT-ZsV6ApHA,5,4,4,jFVxVJvvax9AiSW4TOSj7A

It took almost 90 minutes from the time we got there until we got our food. When it did come, the fish was overdone for one guest, the steak was underdone for another, and the rest was just ok. They had run out of iceberg for their wedge salad which we were told about before we ordered, but they also apparently ran out of romaine for the Caesar as well - which we learned of when it arrived with baby lettuce. I get it's a first world problem but when the prices are high - so are the expectations.  That said the asparagus and tempura cauliflower were great.

I was recently in Las Vegas for a Bachelorette party, and the Foundation room was her dinner pick. The restaurant hostess was nice enough (maybe smart enough) to tuck us away in a private dining room where we could be as loud as we wanted. There the decor was outdated and kind of strange, but the views overlooking the west were to die for, especially as the sun when down.

It happened to be Restaurant week in Vegas so a few of us ordered from the 3 course Prix fixe menu for $50. The feedback from that was: the salad was ok, the steak was delicious, and while it tasted good, everyone was too full for dessert. I went rogue and split the truffle mac and cheese and the caprese salad. They were good, just wish the mac and cheese was a bit more truffle-y. Drink seemed to be the highlight of everyone's meal and they were average in price- $7 for a Beer, $15ish for wine and a cocktail.

The Bachelorette's future sister in law who couldn't make the trip was nice enough to order us a round of drinks and dessert from back home. The servers kindly orchestrated that fun surprise. But overall, service was a little slow. It was nice to not be rushed, but we were often wishing they'd walk by so we could order another drink and by the end we were just sitting around and waiting for our checks. 

After dinner we went to the night club next door. Awesome view of the strip- pictures just don't do it justice! While we enjoyed the DJ's music, we left around 11pm to go to our next destination.

While a couple of friends and I (both guys and girls) were waiting for the rest of our group in the Mandalay Bay casino we were given free passes for admission to the Foundation Room. I should have known there that they were desperate to get people in the door. My friends and I used the free passes to go up to the Foundation Room and wait for the rest of our party there.  

I read some reviews before going, so I expected an older, more laid back crowd which was fine by me. What I didn't expect was to see people in flip flops and jean shorts. I understand not having a strict dress code, but at least have some. Yes, the view is really nice of the strip and the decor is pretty cool inside. It is a decent place to go to have a drink, in an intimate setting. In the end, I guess I was just put off by how ""exclusive"" it was touted then to see a whole bunch of people there in beach wear who got free passes.",j-IY7uy0sXhPDhVfLw5sQQ,3,0,3,j-MfT-9KO0FBu9g0CMthJQ

It was only 9:30 so the husband and I walked around and dropped some cash in the casino. We made our way over to the entrance around 10:30- no line, just a few guys that worked there. We walked up to the dude working there and I inquired about the hosted bar. He says ""we aren't doing that"". So I ask why they would give me a wristband that clearly says Ladies hosted bar from 10pm-12am and he repeats ""we aren't doing that"". So I ask if we can just both get in for free since this is clearly a bait and switch situation. He looks at me like he does not know what that phrase means. The husband says something ""polite"" and we leave. 

Bottom line- I am rating the door experience only since I refused to pay for a hustle like that and you can get a great view and great service at Mix. You can also get a great view of the strip from the Voodoo Lounge. There are way too many great places and views in Vegas to deal with crap like that.

1.) Atmosphere: probably my most favorite thing.  The crowd is usually of an older age (30s - 50s) so it's not one of those BOOM BOOM clubs with 21 year olds going crazy and tripping off of something.  It's very classy and lounge-y here.  Around 10 PM, it becomes more of the nightclub environment and they take some of the bar stools away and some performers come out with shimmery, gold costumes.  The performers do choreographed dances, come out on stilts, and wear some weird 12-inch long fingernails which gives a burlesque type of feel.

2.) The View:  You are up on the 64th floor at the end of the Strip.  You can see down the entire length of Las Vegas Blvd.  Definitely a show stopper and a must see when visitors come to town.  It will make you look super cool to out-of-towners.

3.) The Service:  We've had the luxury of getting bottle service a few times, and the service from the door, to the host, to the bouncers has been top notch.  There is one bouncer in particular who I like the most.  I don't know his name, but he is hard to miss: a very tall, muscular, bald, Black man.  I once got caught in the crowd on my way back from the bathroom.  This gentleman saw me trying to squeeze through the crowd, took my hand, and personally led me through all the people back to our table.  On New Year's Eve, our host Wade went above and beyond to treat us well.  He walked us out onto the patio to a VIP area to watch the fireworks away from the crowd.

4.) Membership Perks: If you are a member, they have special events a couple times a month.  They are really cool.  Once they had a Kid's Night In and you got to bring kids up to the dining area where they had face painting, caricaturists, and balloon animals along with ""kid food"" like hot dogs and sliders and a s'mores station.

There is a restaurant but we were just there for drinks.  I would like to go back sometime as I am sure the dinner views are gorgeous.

3859567,2014-10-20,6,ruWTngdiC68O9la27hvvHw,"First, I would like to start off this comment by stating that I only post on Yelp if it's really good, or REALLY bad. This, my friends, is unfortunately the latter.

The short version of my post: Foundation Room tried to play us for fools and ruined our dining experience.

The long version: (which I hope you'll read because it's quite ridiculous)

To start things off, my girlfriends and I ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. Nothing fancy, just a $50 bottle that we were already planning to order more of (get Vegas started off right, right?!) So we order the first bottle and this is where the fun begins...

Instead of bringing out the bottle and doing the normal wine presentation that you're used to seeing at a restaurant, she brings out a tray with four pre-filled glasses that each look as though they have one shot of wine in each glass. She sets them down in front of us and leaves. My friends and I (who are no strangers to wine) just stare at each other in disbelief. She calls this a glass of wine? Where is the rest? There was maybe three sips in each. Maybe. Now, I know we didn't order their top notch bottle and I didn't expect their in-house sommelier to pour it, but I did expect to at least see the bottle and I did expect to at least receive the entire contents of the bottle that we were paying for and not just a portion of it. Everyone at the table knew instantly that there was no way we were poured an entire bottle of wine (unless, of course, it was the World's smallest bottle of wine.)

Now, since we had no proof that she didn't pour us the entire bottle (since she never brought it out to us and it was pre-poured in back) we ordered another bottle for our husbands and asked for new glasses. We also asked her for the bottle to be brought to the table(uncorked) and a presentation. Our waitress obliged. She came out with the new bottle, corked it before us and filled up the new glasses in the exact amount she did with the first four original wine glasses. And guess what, surprise surprise, after pouring the contents in equal amounts as the first round, there was still HALF A BOTTLE left remaining on the table. So our little experiment worked and proved that she did in fact completely scam us on the first bottle ordered--by filling our glasses in the back of the house and trying to pass it off as a full bottle.

We were obviously bummed this was happening, especially given the reputation of the restaurant, so in order to remedy the situation and not cause a scene, one of my girlfriends pulled the waitress aside in the hallway and told her we knew what had happened and that we just wanted things made right. The waitress completely agreed, apologized for the situation and told my friend she'd make sure it was taken care of. 

Foundation Rooms remedy: Two complimentary desserts (which we didn't order) and instead of charging us for a full bottle for the first bottle, they charged us for four individual glasses of wine instead.
 
Now, why do people order bottles of wine instead of individual glasses of wine at restaurants? Because it's cheaper and you get more, right? So aside from the desserts we didn't want, their solution was to actually charge us MORE for the wine than what we had originally asked for. My blood pressure was through the roof at this point. The dessert was a nice gesture, but we didn't ask for it. I was completely fine paying full amount for the second bottle since we actually were able to enjoy it fully BUT BY GOD I wasn't paying anything towards something we didn't order, weren't able to enjoy and were just outright cheated on.

I gestured the waitress over, pointed to the four glasses of wine by the glass listed on the receipt and simply told her ""Mam, we did not order four glasses of wine, we ordered a bottle of wine. Since you and I both know we did not receive a bottle of wine, I would like these glasses of wine we didn't order removed."" 

Our waitress nodded, and without hesitation, FINALLY fixed the situation.

We travel to Vegas three-four times a year and needless to say, I do not recommend The Foundation Room and will not be returning. 

I hope you find this review helpful and that Foundation Room improves their manner and poor service.",n2YqgORal8MgpsDvco_8SA,11,5,1,jx8O4vevJ9SsnG5pHRfjlg

He offered us some 2-for-1 drink passes at Foundation Room.  When I inquired about cover, he hemmed and hawed and eventually said he could walk us in.  It was a few moments of confusion at the door, as I don't think he was supposed to walk in 3 guys, but it worked!

We made it up to the bar with minutes before 10pm, when the 2-for-1's stopped working, and we got a round of drinks.  $18 for 2 rum & cokes and 2 beers.  OK prices, but we wouldn't be sticking around for a full priced round.

3966787,2014-08-26,7,ruWTngdiC68O9la27hvvHw,"*** Review for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***

The Foundation Room has been a place I've wanted to try for awhile and when I saw it on the Restaurant Week listing, I made my reservation for 6 PM.  While the elevator indicates it's on the 63rd floor, it's actually on the 53rd because this hotel does not use floors numbered in the 40s because of the superstitions of some Asian gamblers.

Greeted at the podium, I was told to go to the bar area and they'd come and get me when ready.  I took the time to explore the bar area and its eclectic mix of art.  It's really fascinating, funny, and very comfortable.  I also went out on the terrace to enjoy that marvelous view of the Las Vegas Strip looking north.  Soon the hostess came and got me and led me to my table on the west side of the room.  She gave me the option of sitting nearer the terrace windows but I was fine where she first took me.  Since the sun was still up, the shades were drawn but I still could see the peaks at Red Rock Canyon and Mount Potosi.  Later, the shades were raised for a great evening view.  On to the food.

Bread service was a nice basket and it was accompanied by a tray holding three dishes, one with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, one with garlic hummus, and one with sweet butter.  The hummus was great.  I'd rather have salted butter and there was no salt on the table.  I'll bring a fast food packet(s) with me in the future.

It's really a four course RW meal.  Everyone gets a Foundation Room salad with red wine vinaigrette dressing, teardrop tomatoes, and pine nut brittle.  The pine nut brittle sweetness was a nice counter to the tart vinaigrette.

Next, I chose the chicken tikka skewers served with pineapple ghost chili jam.  The chicken was marinated in yogurt and curry.  The chicken was marvelous with a great spice flavor and the jam was extra spicy which gave this appetizer a real zing to the beginning of the meal.

For the main course, I got shrimp and grits.  The shrimp was served with a chipotle sauce, again spicy and wonderful, and there were jalapeño rings with the dish.  The grits were very good.  This was another winner!

For dessert, I chose the molten chocolate cake.  It took awhile to make but that was OK.  More time to enjoy the view.  When the cake came, it was accompanied by some vanilla bean ice cream with fresh raspberries and two chocolate truffles.  There was little molten to the cake but it was good.  The ice cream was very good and the chocolate truffles were, too!

Service throughout the evening was good.  I was surprised that both a busser and the server left my empty Sweet 'n Low packet on the table but other than that, service was attentive.  

This was an excellent Restaurant Week pick!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,9,4,b6IqyVk64VxrHUemQhe4ug

4072802,2013-04-17,0,ruWTngdiC68O9la27hvvHw,"We were introduced to this place by a good friend during my recent trip to Las Vegas. My friend was able to get my date and I into this place for free ($30 charge normally). Our reservation was scheduled for 7 PM so we arrived at approximately 30 minutes prior to our reservation. This allowed us to hit up the lounge arrange which arguably has the best view towards the Las Vegas strip. For the view alone and the pleasant lounge area, I'd strongly suggest you come here. The day after, my date and I went to Bubba Gumps on the strip. That is where I looked across towards the Mandalay Bay and realized how high this lounge area is. Amazing! 

Now, the decor inside was dark (intimate) but I'd say some of the interior furniture and decorations were outdated, thus the dark lighting? Not sure. The service was excellent. Our dinner started off with a complementary bread basket which I can always appreciate. I requested that bread be warmed up and the server complied with the request. My date's Martini was accidentally spilled, the server kindly brought out another Martini for us. Major points for that!

Food: We started off with a Ahi Tuna Snap Pea Salad and an order of their Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. Personally, not impressed with either dish. The server noted one of the specials of the night which was a 22 oz. Porterhouse steak which we ordered. but yet didn't realize that it was a $72 order once we received the bill. Being that the 16 oz. T-Bone steak was listed at $55, $72 doesn't sound so bad especially since my friend was able to get us a $100 gift card and a bottle of '09 CA Pinot Noir from Sonoma County which was totally was unexpected. Bonus for us. The sides we ordered along with the steak was the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese and the Grilled Asparagus which were excellent and strongly recommend. 

Being that Vegas hotels nowadays charge for items such as internet access, club entry, gym and/or pool access, etc., with the view alone, $30 is entry fee is not such a bad deal. I'd say, if you've never been, go and at the very least, enjoy the fantastic and very unique view towards The Strip. $$$-$$$$ for food so be prepared.",iAT6Ah-N7QWd6XbafVYSsQ,3,0,4,QViRAGLP7OjL7xjcHl-Exw

Anyway, it was a nice meal and a good time. We had fun and the view is gorgeous. I'd go for drinks, but I think there are better places (for the same, if not cheaper) for the amount of money you're spending.",b0fp-eS8_MKTg4tcZsCNqQ,2,0,4,OFysZjii5pI2gWfow9D4Dw

We made reservations for Saturday evening and checked in at the counter on the casino level. We were led to the elevator and up to the very top of Mandalay Bay. The vibe up top is very unique and is best explained by looking at photos. 

To begin I ordered a glass of Merlot and my husband ordered a Cucumber Chill. I was surprised to find that there were many reasonably priced wines by the glass to choose from on the menu. The cucumber cocktail was delicious and refreshing. We were also brought a bread basket with a couple of types of bread including pretzel. Alongside was hummus, oil, and butter. 

The Foundation Room Salad for me and Caesar Salad for my husband. Both were large portions for starter salads. My salad had Bibb lettuce, other assorted vegetables, and a delicious vinaigrette. My husband enjoyed his Caesar as well.

I enjoyed my Center Cut Filet very much. It was well seasoned and juicy. The Pomme Puree side was creamy with a lovely butter flavor. My husband ordered Pan Seared Diver Scallops and really didn't enjoy this dish. He thought the scallops were a bit rubbery and generally not the best scallops he's had. 

The finale for the meal was the highlight for me. My husband pretended to be healthy with a generous serving of Fresh Berries. I enjoyed the Calvados Apple Bread Pudding and wished I had saved more room. This was one of the most delicious desserts I've had in awhile. The bread pudding was delicious, but the walnut caramel sauce put the decadence over the top.

Our waitress was very friendly and warm. She made us feel very welcome and the amount of times she checked in on us was just right. The man assisting her was on top of filling waters and clearing plates as necessary. They definitely met my service expectations for a nice restaurant.

Overall, the restaurant lends itself to a nice plate for a date night or peaceful meal with friends. Check out the lounge down the hall after dinner for one of the best views of The Strip!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,8,3,4,ajNpMYsAJ9kjhIYMPx4Xnw

This club is AMAZING! I know this analogy might sound lame, but if you were ever a fan of the Osborne's... you might just like this place. Being at this club reminded me of partying at the Osborne's house. There were even fireplaces and couches... OH SO COOL.

WOW, WOW, WOW is all I can say.

Amazing view and a brilliant place to enjoy a proper cigar after 10:00 PM (due to local laws). 

The drinks are expensive for non-members ($15 - $26 each) and the cigars in their humidor are just mediocre, so I recommend going downstairs to Davidoff to get a proper smoke (which can bring up - just don't light up in advance). I enjoyed the La Spann specialty drink I had there even if it was a bit overpriced.

I got a wonderful tour by the manager, Steve, and this place is brilliant. You definitely feel like you are Robin Leach living in the lap of luxury.

The membership fees are very expensive, but might make sense for certain businesses who want to wow clients in the area. 

There does seem to be a large number of non-members in attendance which diminishes the value of the membership. However, I'm thankful as I'd rather pay the $30 to be able to visit than to be required to have a $1500+ annual membership.

The view from the balcony is simply the best I've seen in Vegas (but The Hotel at Mandalay Bay is roughly the same view). 

I didn't try the food and I wasn't there for the live entertainment. 

It was very crowded after 10. It's also a sausage fest so expect to see a lot of middle aged men in large groups and very few women.

The waitresses were terrible and inattentive unless you have table service and are ringing up $1000+ plus bills on booze (which is very easy to do). 

The membership doesn't make sense for me since I don't get to Vegas much, but I'd love to go back. It was definitely the highlight of my trip and a pure joy.

It's a great place for business networking as there were a lot of influential business people here, so that may be another reason to invest in a membership if you travel frequently to Vegas.",VZA9wvxLyzueaqJOlNrlAw,0,0,5,I9_omxa0zR9qK5Vreg99tA

First off if you don't know where Fountain Room is good luck trying to find it while you're in the casino. Ok I'll just tell you, if you are by hotel registration it is right behind you. There will be a host stand that will send you up the restaurant. 

We went to dinner a bit late. Reservation was at 8:30pm. There were two other tables seated so place was not busy at all. Service staff was great and attentive. 

Food on the other hand was a different story. We started off with crab cakes and they tasted like they were frozen and thawed out then frozen again and fried. Definitely had a store bought feel to them. Was not tasty whatsoever. 

Then our salad followed. Typical Caesar salad, not special but highly over priced. Only thing good about this was I asked for a side of anchovies and those looked extremely fresh. Still had a good silver color on them. 

Next was entree. We ordered braised short ribs and truffled mac n cheese. Usually short ribs fall off the bone and this one did not. Was still soft but not the melt in your mouth type. Still had to put some effort into cutting the meat which is not good. Also there was not too much flavor to the dish. The truffled mac n cheese tasted like they blow the air from the truffles onto the mac n cheese. Top layer had the smell of truffles but once you got past that it was nothing but a simple bowl of mac n cheese, definitely not worth the price.

Last we had the pear tart for dessert. Dessert came out cold and didn't have the sweet and savory taste it should have.

Couple of things 1) If ""locals"" are free, why did my friends who are local have to pay? 2) When did it become socially acceptable for ppl to see a girl get finger banged in her butt? 

I know #2 intrigues most of you so let me explain. There were these 2 ""girls"" (should be more like whores but whatever)  who were sitting next to the door all over themselves. BTW a guy was there too. So OK they're making out whatever, but when you start seeing one of the girls spread eagle and start getting fingered in the butt, that's just nasty. I don't care how horny you are, you do not, I repeat, do not need to get fingered in the butt in public. That grossed a lot of ppl out, obviously. Made me and the group leave the bar for a while.

The other big reason why I now think this place suck is the management. The guy who let us in the last time is now a huge d*ck.

Of course my friend tried to protect herself by putting her hand out but the manager said she was shoving the door open? WTF?! 

We weren't even there for 1 hr. None of us were drunk but got kicked out for ""slamming the door"".

It might be safe to say that the foundation room has the best view of the strip in Vegas. I'm a view person, I love a good sight to see, so this weighs heavily with me and it's why I keep going back. 

They play decent music, and it's more of a lounge feel than a club. They also have bottle service and tables outside overlooking the strip which is definitely the way to do it. 

Inside is a little dingy and dated, but that's like he whole point so it's fine.

1. Slowness. It took about 30 minutes before a server asked what we'd like to drink.  And the saddest part is that this was before rush hour! Every other drink order came 20 minutes too late.

2. I was trying to nibble off of my salad on the very edge of the ""coffee"" table because it was full of other massively-sized plates - no room left for anything else. My pricy salad became a floor accessory.  The server so kindly took my plate away but offered nothing in return - no redo, no discounted new salad.

3. We had two members at our table, and in the later night we ended up in a reserved space where we were pretty much secluded in the worst way possible: No service again.  The reason, they claimed: The reserved space is for bottle service only.  $500 bottle of wine is normal in LV, I get it. But on this fine night, not one of the 6 people in our group wanted wine.  But, in order to get anything else, we had to walk out of the reserved space, go down stairs, go to the bar, and order ourselves.

4788747,2016-03-09,1,ruWTngdiC68O9la27hvvHw,"""Antithesis""-A Review of Foundation Room, Las Vegas, Nevada

One night while recording my GoPro pilot television show, I utilized the word ""antithesis"" properly while still piss drunk.  My ability to manipulate the English language, while inebriated baffles me.  Nevertheless, a literary antithesis emphasizes elaboration through the contrast of opposites by parallel structures of the contrasted phrases.  Usually below the surface of ground, the lowest part of a building, wall, or other structure can be defined as a foundation.  However, when it comes to Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada, located on the sixty-fourth floor, the Foundation Room is the antithesis of foundation.  

Exiting the elevator, the Foundation Room nightclub experience transforms into a surreal, almost heavenly atmosphere.  Unfortunately, my iPhone6s broke from jumping into the pool at Wet Republic, so I do not have any photographs.  But if I recall correctly, the décor infused Asian Indian culture while advertising hues of amber and magenta, which mirrored the Mandalay Bay reflective ambiance.  The lighting and music volumes were both perfect, neither too loud nor too soft.  Likewise, the bathrooms were spot on point for a nightclub.  Most importantly, good-looking attentive, and competent bartending staff quickly mixed our drinks immediately.  

Up until this point, I thought the Foundation Room was a pretty good nightclub, and then the dancers came out.  They were fantastic.  Typical of any Vegas club, they were better looking and better dancers what I saw in Chicago during the winter of 2015 at Shay and Underground.  Slowly but surely, my first impressions of Foundation Room were becoming better and better.  Then I travelled outside and my breath was literally swept away. 

Being born and raised in the Chicago land area, I would like to say the view from the sixty-fourth floor rivals that of the John Hancock Signature Room on the ninety-fifth floor in Chicago, Illinois.  However, you are outside with the wind blowing in your face and it is VEGAS baby!  The view from the Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, Nevada is the best place to drink on the planet.  In fact, I told Hot Blonde Chick #2, ""You see this town?  One day it will be ours!""  

Then some crazy British chick came by and attempted to ruin our moment.  She said something about Americans being overly capitalistic and money driven or something.  It was VEGAS.  With her slutty outfit, she was obviously throwing her boobs into my face.  Therefore, I eloquently informed her, ""The top button on your blouse is undone.""  

You will never believe what she did!

She completely ripped her blouse open, exposing her bra and bare chest.  Realizing her embarrassment, she punched me in the face.  Then her friends escorted her away.  My girlfriend and I laughed before returning to our own world, discussing our plans.

LOOK, if you're looking for a place with thousands of people crammed into an obscure tinny space with loud over bearing music, then Foundation Room is not the place for you.  

However, if you are in search of a great place to chill and gaze out over the beautiful city of Las Vegas, with the window blowing in your hair...

If you are in search of an awesome place to grab a table and a bottle of champagne...

If you are in search of a Cosmo and some dancing with plenty of room, then Foundation Room is the Las Vegas nightclub right for you.  Hell, I would rebook Mandalay Bay, just for the pools and Foundation Room.  This is coming from an Aria and MGM whore.

Anyway, at some point that weekend, some fat bald old guy complained about not being able to get into Foundation Room.  Now, I don't know if this was true; however, at Foundation Room, Hot Blonde Chick #2 and I were recruited to enter.  At Foundation Room, we were given free entry due to our astonishingly good-looks.  At Foundation Room, we were given free drink tickets.  For a late twenty and early thirty year old Vegas voyager, that is amazing service.  That is why with all the clubs in Vegas we returned time and time again during our six-day stay.  If you find my review biased because of this fact, then that is your opinion.  However, clubs want good-looking people because it is good business.  

If you are a fat bald old guy, then you should probably workout, not go clubbing, or have money.  The fat bald old guy is the antithesis of the owners' desired patronage demographics, the foundation of their service.   If you are the antithesis of the foundation, then there is room for improvement.  For the last year, whether it has been Virginia Beach, Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago, or Las Vegas, Foundation Room is Brdman and Hot Blonde Chick favorite nightclub.",IhYWUL5MT7WXBmctJmdYJQ,0,2,5,yZ-G-kLN1VAMtAoibrKQ6g

Why only three stars? I've been here twice (the first time on a Friday night), but this review is for the last visit on a Sunday night.

Then we had to deal with the bitchy female bartender. She ignored me for a good five minutes, despite the lack of customers. She was too busy talking to her male friend at the end of the bar. She made my boyfriend's martini completely wrong, and took her sweet time doing it. Thanks for the hospitality.

Then we went outside to sit on the balcony, and it was full of dirty glasses and cocktail napkins on the floor. Only one heat lamp was working, and other patrons were freezing and complaining.

The hip hop from the 90's they were spinning got boring fast, so we left. Maybe it was just their B team on staff that night, but that is not the type of experience I go to Vegas for.",ptYMVF9IjRsNRTji6-pd2A,7,1,3,ou1C7Q-VYDYcnAM52Pmiew

We came here last night for restaurant week. For $50 you get a 3-course meal.  I chose the crab cakes for my appetizer, the 6 oz. filet for my entree, and the molten lava chocolate cake for my dessert.  

The crab cakes were two per serving and they were pretty big. They didn't have too much breading and had a slight crisp on the outside with large chunks of crab on the inside. They came with a slaw that complimented the crab cakes perfectly.

The steak came with a gorgonzola cream sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about the steak with that cream sauce. The steak was perfectly cooked to how I ordered it and it tasted so amazing with the sauce. The seasoning was just right as well. Other than Joe's Stone Crab, this is one of the best filets I've ever had.  

The molten chocolate cake was good. It didn't blow me away but maybe that's because I was stuffed by then.  

The other time I was here we also ordered the mac and cheese and again, one of my FAVORITE mac n cheese's at fancy restaurant ever.  I crave this meal!

Went there last weekend with my best friend and guess what, it was neither hard to get a reservation nor was it that incredibly expensive.  I was in the room all day in the morning for the shooting of a show, and this guy there kept telling us how exclusive this place was, members only, and pointing out that celebrities have their own cubby by the entrance with the the type of alcohol they like to drink.  I called, made reservations, I was exclusive too.

When I called I did get asked if I was a member, I said no.  The girl asked ""how did you hear about us?"" and I said someone told me about it.  That was it.  

They do have a dress code for dinner, no tennis shoes, no hats.  Business casual they called it.  However, you can wear jeans.  At the bottom, there were like 3 bouncers, all who melted into puppies when I told them I had a reservation.

The service was GREAT, and they appreciated a little humor.  The food was fantastic.  I had some sort of seafood dish which was spectacular.  My friend ordered the lamb, which she couldn't finish, so we took a medallion home.  I ate it cold hours later, and it was still fantastic!

The views are, of course, spectacular.  You can see the entire strip.  However, I was taking pics with the Canon EOS 7D and one of the bouncer guys said ""I'm sorry, you can't use that camera up here, it's too powerful"".  Uh...what?  No clue what that was about, but apparently you should just bring one of those little point and shoot cameras that every drunk girl in Vegas has.

Yes, the view is absolutely fabulous.  With the Mandalay Bay Hotel being at the south end of the strip, it gives you a fabulous view looking up the strip.  And yes, we took a picture up there too.  With a view like that, who doesn't? While enjoying the view, you also meet the most interesting of people who are happy to invite you to party with them, and I do mean 'party' in all ways Vegas can be interpreted.

The music was okay, and the crowd was interesting.  There was a variety of people, in terms of age and genre.  I can't say the same about the ethnic card though as there wasn't such a diversity at all.  We checked out some of the smaller rooms and danced a bit.  I wasn't too impressed by the cow who tripped over her drunk self while apparently trying to dance sexy and in the process stuck her heel into my foot. (And of course, I was wearing open-toed shoes.)  It wouldn't have been so bad if she apologized or excused herself, but she was so drunk and embarrassing that the guys around her were having a 'good' time with her.  Odds were they were both trying to figure out who gets to take her home 'cuz you know she was going to go home with someone, it was just a matter of who.  (If I were them, they both should have negotiated and both gone with her!)  

The ladies' room gets crowded as everyone is in there fixing their make-up and you're bound to find someone, anyone kicking back with the restroom attendant.  I wasn't sure if it was a guest or a cocktail waitress, either way, she was just sitting in there chatting it up all night long. 

It's not that crowded on a Saturday night because you do need to be on the list or a member.  Monday nights are crazy because that's when they open up the doors to the public.

Walking into Foundation, it was almost reminiscent of Disneyland's haunted mansion with a hint of elegance and class. It has 2 separate rooms, one with a bar and more of a bigger lounge area and another private room, while the other had more of a living room feel to it. There was even a fireplace. The furniture is very regal and lush and there are candles lit to complete the serene ambiance. The dj that night played good music pleasing to the ears and soul. It was nice not to hear the usual ""to the window, to the wall!"" type of music. 

The best part was the amazing view. The balcony overlooks the entire strip so get those cameras ready if you love taking skyline view pictures! The balcony also has couches and standing tables to bask in all it's glory. 

This is a good place to check out, if you like the social, let's talk and have drinks kind of scene. I went for a Project party, so my friends and I got in free. I read that this place is very exclusive and ""very VIP"" which in Vegas means you need connections to get in.

Upon entering after the elevator ride up you walk through dimly lit halls to get to each room of the floor. It's decorated beautifully in rich wood and classy dark structures. There definitely is great ambiance. 

The best part I must say along with other critics is the view! It is an absolutely stunning view of the city. Great place to relax and have a drink. We had free drink coupons, but obviously the drinks aren't the best deals you'd get in town. 

The vibe was totally different when I had came here for the dub-step show. Obviously there was a different crowd and the room was a bit small to be having such loud bass playing all night. Other than that, the couches are luscious and the workers I had come across weren't all that bad, but could be a little friendlier in my opinion.

Not too cohesive in my opinion.  The view was out of this world, though.  Amazing.

For the party, it was great.  The Foundation room offered a full bar and a few signature cocktails for the evening.  I got the Peach and Elderflower Collins the entire night.  Bombay Sapphire, juice of a half a lemon, St. Germain and peach puree.  It was delicious and trust me, I'm NOT a gin drinker.  This drink was amazing.

There's more to the Mandalay Bay than Rum Jungle (gag!) you ask?  
Yes, there is and it's called the Foundation Room.  And once you've experienced it you'll find yourself setting the bar high for any other lounge in comparison.

We were staying at the Mandalay bay for the weekend & were looking for a place that had a UFC 196 viewing party. They offered $25 general admission for the standing room or $200 to spend on food & drinks for up to four guest at a table. Solid deal considering you'll be there 3-4 hours & $200 to split four ways is nothing.

Initially we were annoyed because the doors were suppose to open at 6 but there was an issue with some of the host being late that escort people up the elevator to the 64th floor so things were delayed half an hour. While waiting in line we talked to some people that have been there before & they assured us that the food will make up for the little delay we were all going through.

On the lounge side serve a limited section of the menu, it may seems a little pricy but it was worth every penny & I'm not the ""foodie"" type of person that typically defends expensive food just because it taste good.

Imagine my disappointment, after getting onto the VIP list with the help of a local connection, but it's the truth.  (The Foundation Room is open to the hoi polloi on Mondays, or else there wouldn't be much point in reviewing it, would there?)

Okay, yes, it does feel pretty awesome when you walk up to the unobtrusive podium in the lobby, murmur your name to the hostess behind the desk, and get waved through the ropes to the single elevator.  There's no need to punch buttons, because it only goes one place - straight up to the Foundation (ironically, located at almost the very top of Mandalay Bay).  

When the elevator doors open, you're greeted with the kind of quiet, plush elegance that tells you you really don't belong.  The club consists of a series of rooms branching off to either side of a main lounge.  From the lounge, you can also reach the restaurant and the balcony, which really does have a stunning view of the Strip - the best in the city, if the hype is to be believed.  It's pretty spectacular, and so the balcony is always crowded with people wrestling between their desire to gawk and their desire to look cool and jaded.

And yes, the decor is not only tasteful but actually beautiful - romantically dim lights, opulent Indian and Asian art and decorations, and exotic wood paneling and carvings.  Smaller, private rooms off the hallways are reserved for private parties, but a quick peek revealed low, plush couches and more elaborate furnishings and art.  

The main lounge is where the bar is, but good luck muscling your way up to the front and getting served - and if you do, you'll find yourself paying $12 for a small drink that's mostly ice.  Yum.  A second, smaller room has another bar and (at least the night I was there) a complimentary hookah table set up on one side, with three hookahs bubbling away in different flavors.  Bowls of plastic-wrapped disposable mouthpieces were set out, so you'd just grab one and get ready to puff - an uncharacteristically free bonus in an otherwise insanely overpriced place.

The music wasn't anything super-special - muted trance-house with a vaguely Asian flavor in the lounge, and more hip-hop in the smaller room.  But everyone is too busy looking hott and being way too cool to actually want to dance, so all there really is to do here is silently judge each other's outfits and suck on your expensive ice drink.  This is okay for about an hour, but then it gets old fast.

I'm glad I went to the Foundation Room for two reasons: to see that magnificent view, and to have my illusions about exclusive members-only clubs demolished.  Yeah, it's posh and people are probably wearing outfits that cost more than my annual salary, but you'll have way more fun slurping $2 beaker shots and dancing to disco at Gay Corners, where everyone's allowed in.

The entry line was short and we waited less than three minutes to get in. Once inside, we headed straight to the bar to get our drinks. At this point, I was getting pretty wary because to get free drinks, you typically need a wristband or drink tickets but we had received nil. I approached the bartender and asked about the open bar for chicks and she rudely responded ""You need drink tickets"".  Okay, where do I find those? ""Go ask the hostess"". 

We made our way back to the hostess stand, where I was ignored for what seemed like ages. Finally the chatty employees realized someone was standing in front of them. I asked about drink tickets and again, was met with rudeness. ""The host at check-in downstairs was supposed to give them to you. You have to go back down."" Well, this sucks. I contemplated simply leaving. Back down the elevators we went. I had to wait in line AGAIN and asked for drink tickets this time. We got 2 each.

I texted the promoter and told him about all this BS, and he actually contacted the manager of Foundation Room, who texted me back in minutes. He told me where to find him and once I did, he apologized and then gave my friend and I 6 more drink tickets. That almost made up for the debacle I was made to contend with.

Now that we could finally relax, we meandered around the small lounge and got to enjoy the view of the city. It is jam packed out on the balcony, so good luck finding a spot! The music is deplorable and was mostly outdated pop music. I'll admit the vibe was pretty cool - there was an eastern theme going on with statues of Buddha and elephants. Later in the night, women came out dressed as belly dancers and danced on top of platforms. The crowd is mostly older. I wouldn't describe Foundation Room as a lounge because when it's hard to walk around and make conversation, you're no longer considered a lounge, you're a friggin club. 

Worth a Return Visit?
The promoter and the manager were the saving graces of my experience at Foundation Room. Had it not been for their swift corrective actions, I would've wrote Foundation Room off forever. Even so, coming back is a big maybe.

Famously known as the lone occupant of Mandalay Bay's 63rd Floor, a Restaurant-slash-Nightclub that remains one of Sin City's lone proponents of a dress-code demanding Business Casual or better, it is within the hotel lobby that guests will find elevators behind a velvet rope, the ascent fairly quick to a space designed to impress and staff clearly hired as much for their looks as abilities to seat and serve.

One of eight such venues across America, the recent hiring of Chef Corey Miller from Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM promising upcoming menu changes per a middle-aged male waiter, it is after passing by statues of Buddha and other Deities that guests are seated in a room of polished wood with a balcony offering a panoramic view of Las Vegas Boulevard, a ""guest-list"" and/or cover charge apparently the only way to assure admission after dark on busier nights.

Priced significantly higher than House of Blues Restaurant or recently introduced B-Side, Happy Hour in the spacious Bar offering some good deals Sunday through Thursday while the current Restaurant Week three-course offers over 25% off a collection of longtime signatures, it was with Strip-priced Cocktails deferred that a Bread Basket appeared featuring five options alongside three Dips or Spreads, the fact that some were still warm a nice touch though only the Ciabatta lightly speckled with Olives and Crisps spread with Red Pepper Hummus proved worth more than a single taste.

Playing mid-tempo Pop overhead, the lack of Blues or even Rock telling as much about Foundation Room's target audience as a menu loosely rooted in the South but otherwise nondescript American 'Steakhouse,' it was with ""Salmon and a Salad with Dressing on the side"" tourists seated on both sides that Foundation Room's ""Jumbo"" Lump Crabcakes were presented, the adjective in reference not to portion but the chunks of sweet Crustacean that showed well without much binder beneath a fairly basic Apple and Fennel Salad.  

Decidedly curious about $40 Shrimp and Grits, ""My Cousin Vinny"" quotes about *Magic* Grits seemingly the only explanation for such a price, it was perhaps predictable that neither portion nor presentation outperformed what one gets at Yardbird for $28 or down South for $15, the fact that Shrimp were well cooked but largely overwhelmed by spices and salinity also worth noting.

Excellent in terms of service, both the Waiter and Runners present without being obtrusive and always quick to clear plates or refill Water, it was after Chef Miller toured the room checking in on guests that Dessert was presented, a small ramekin with bubbling Berries at the base and Custard-soaked Cubes of Bread beneath melting Peanut Butter Ice Cream definitely the night's highlight while ""fresh baked"" Cookies that arrived no more than five minutes after ordering were probably better described as ""warmed-to-order,"" the flavors just fine but texture medium-crisp from edge to center and none as noteworthy as the Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream that is sweet yet subtle and one of the better scoops in Sin City.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Undeniably a concept more about the scene than its cuisine The House of Blues Foundation Room offers an experience well-suited to tourists and something 'fancy' but accessible, though with so many great Restaurants at Mandalay Bay and Rivea offering a better view at a similar pricepoint there seems little reason to book a table rather than just stopping in for Ice Cream or a Drink at the Bar.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,2,3,vlmRBCJekyfCcKv39qH1Qg

The crowd here tends to be older, I would say 40-something is the median age. Tons of plush seating and the walls are covered in tapestry. Foundation has a very middle eastern feel to it.

Seated at the very south end of elegant Las Vegas Blvd, you see all of the high rises as well as downtown Las Vegas. The patio is always stuffed with older gentlemen, suited up, and puffing on cigars (it's that snazzy kind of joint).

The music varies from night to night depending on the DJ (most, in my experience tend to be Top 40 to 80s genre of music), but I have never heard house or hip-hop dominate a night.

First and foremost, the view from their balcony is absolutely the best thing about this place.  It offers one of the best views of the Strip you can possibly get.  My date and I got free tickets to go up and enjoy the place.  It has a really cool vibe to it, as well.

But, unfortunately, my date was Completely ignored by the bartender when he went to get a drink.  He stood there 20 minutes(!!), with a $100 bill in his hand, all the while trying to get the guy's attention and watching others get served.  Finally my date told him he was the worst bartender he'd ever met.  Best part: the guy didn't even react.  Wow, Foundation Room.  Way to not impress.  Bottom line: go for the view.

By mid-meal, it was right up there with the worst service I've ever received. The birthday boy was bummed and I was pissed that he was bummed. 

To add insult to injury, the check arrives (early-- we just wanted to get out of there at this point) with a 20% gratuity added. I found the maitre'd (who never so much as glanced in the direction of our table all night) and told him that I wanted the gratuity removed so we could tip what we felt was appropriate for the horrible service we received. This dude had the gall to argue with me about it-- telling me that they add that gratuity specifically so that ""people like you won't stiff our waitstaff"". I told him if he wanted us to pay the bill and leave without making a scene, he would do as I asked. 

Long story short, the gratuity was removed, I tipped Shawn less than 10% and we split. Evening ruined. Thanks for a great time, Foundation Room!  :P",A2dh9q7eP-48bCk1P3PI7w,0,2,2,YW5OXnaO5SlvMFIfQsy8Qw

No really. In Vegas, where the average skirt length is 8"" and the cup size is a D, I'd say the Foundation Room somehow attracts people who are a TINY bit more conservative, which is all you need, because it IS Vegas after all, not church. 

And for those of you who do want a little more sin, they have 2 dancers dancing around in their bikinis, just because. 

And we did get really stiff drinks, they didn't cost me a kidney, the view is spectacular. It's almost worth walking to from the other end of the strip! And on hot summer nights, I have a feeling the outdoor area will be even more popular than ever - smokers rejoice and congregate. 

I also really love the outside bar with dance area - it's not too big and not too small, and there are sectioned off areas for VIP's. Maybe if your feet get too tired someone will take pity on you and let you rest there, then feed you Moet to cool you off.

I was initially worried because our group consisted of 4 males - me being the only female.  Nevertheless, we had no problems at the door (not even a cover), and up the elevator 50 floors we went.

Foundation room is very aesthetically pleasing, as it is decorated in an old-world gypsy/indian/bhuddist theme with lots of lavish fabrics and oriental rugs.  It was a pleasure to wander around from room to room and explore what each had to offer, and every room offered amazing views of the sparkling city.  The rooms are all located off of a long hallway, each one having a different musical theme.  We spent most of our time in the hip hop room and out on the marvelous balcony. 

The view, people.  You look straight down the strip, with the huge Mandalay Bay sign at your level just feet away in all its glittering glory.  The balcony is quite large, and there was ample seating for everyone.  

The only negative thing that happened here was how some racist douchebag made a derogatory comment towards a woman right in front of us.  He would have been a real downer if it weren't for the fabulousness of Foundation room that made up for his idiocy.",4k9-LoufKfGflVzQfmkrdw,1,3,4,Ne63849wcdpxg1mzGObaow

I was kind of drawn to this place due to the reputation it has for the view - but I think I missed the view. From the Restaurant itself, it's not really that fantastic. I had to have been in the wrong spot. It was nice, don't get me wrong, but not breathtaking. And, I do want to mention the incense smell when you step off the elevator...it reeks. To me, all incense reminds me of urinal cakes. Don't ask me why, don't try to rationalize it...but it does. And that's not what I want to smell whilst eating. 

To the food - I started with a Caesar salad, which was fine. Pretty normal - a thinner than expected dressing, good greens, good cheese...oh, and what made it worthwhile? A giant cracker made entirely of baked cheese. Amazing. Worth ordering just for that. 

My entree was a New York Strip, supposedly dry aged even though the menu didn't note this (and I would think would do so if it were true, as that's a selling point). The steak was well cooked, nice grill crust, nice and juicy. A little tooth, but nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, my first and last bites were best, as those delicious end pieces have more of the salty peppery grill crust. So maybe they could amp that up a little bit. Along with it came some nice kale and a white cheddar au gratin, and the steak was topped with some coarse mustard ale butter. That butter was a really nice surprise, and I think it probably made the meal. The tangy mustard wasn't harsh, but was a great accompaniment for the savory au gratin, the slightly bitter kale, and the salty steak. Cut through what might have been a kind of uniform tasting meal. I've not seen mustard like that used as a sauce on a steak, but I applaud it. Without the sauce, this is probably a 3, but with, I think it's a 4. I didn't leave any behind. 

Service was good, not rushed (even though dining alone, I'd almost prefer to be rushed out of the place - what else do I do while I'm waiting for the next course or the check?). They do offer your choice of white or black napkins, which is a nice touch. And the price was reasonable for a good steak, especially when it comes with a few little sides rather than just being meat on a plate. Definitely worth a visit.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,4,0,4,h19tlOX2nVK11iVlAiUT3w

It was very dark, rock and roll, with a bit of an osbournes feel. It smelled like incense. Inside the bar there's about 4 sections with couches and chairs which you can reserve, and there are two private rooms as well, away from the bar and the music. The bar and dancefloor are a bit small but the music was fantastic. On a Monday night, we had a crowd in there that was unreal. By midnight it was so packed you could barely get across the room.

"" it's the Vegasinc Women to Watch 2012 awards"" says Wifee. 

Women to watch I muse, Julia Roberts?, Madonna ? Who? .....surely not a Kardashian I hope. But this is Vegas it's probably a Hilton?

Alas, none of the above, it was a ceremony honoring local business women, usual suspects including Dawn Gibbons ex wife of some ex- someone.

So arriving at Mandalay Bay, I'm disappointed the Valet guys are grumpy and don't seem to really want to park your car. "" Where is The Foundation Room?"" I politely ask the grumpy munchkin, ""There's a sign by the elevator"".

Inside, no obvious elevator so we wander around an almost empty gaming floor until we find the correct one. Front door, turn left towards the shops.

Private lift to a very high floor, unusual room, decorated like I picture Genghis Khans private boudoir. Fancy carpets, Buddhas, cool art. 

More grumpy staff behind the bar, is it because everything is comped? Don't know but grumpy no less. Outside there is a cool large balcony with a view worthy of the price of admission. 

Because it was an early award thingamabob there was little in the way of food, some cheese and chocolate covered strawberries but free Martinis , that's ok! 

A maze of a place and after spending a couple of hours there I am still not sure whether The Foundation Room is a restaurant, club, lounge, combo or merely HQ for grumpy staff.

Our group was in the Mandalay Bay/Delano, so it was a no-brainer to provide this experience with ease.  Not having to worry/plan for multiple taxi's/uber to go somewhere else along the strip was priceless.

The Foundation Room, if it isn't clear, is the House of Blues VIP / Club.  The entrance inside the Mandalay Bay is very nice and feels exclusive.  A hostess ensuring your reservation, and a security guard.  Once you pass, your headed in an elevator direct to the 63rd floor.  Exit, and head straight to another hostess, and your led to the bar area (if you chose dinner, until your table is ready).

I love the feel of the bar, which has an wonderful textured ceiling, very hindu-temple / mosque-like.  Then, boom -- you get a glimpse of the view, and you can step outside to the patio.  Wow!  An amazing view worthy of a selfy and tons of pics.  Because Mandalay is at the end of the strip, it's a unique viewpoint because you can see all of the strip, and certainly, at that height it's tremendous.  Later, as the night goes on 10pm-ish, it's filled up, and features go-go dancers.  It gets quite loud, so earlier 8pm-ish is more my style.

Our group of 10 were led to a back room for dining.  The room sat 80-100, a nice size, not too big and not too small -- perfect.  The menu allowed for us to find great things to order for unique drinks, delicious appetizers, and tantalizing entrees -- mostly in the seafood and steak variety, with a southern twist.  We ordered the Jalapeno-Cheese Cornbread [$10, 4.5 stars], the Shellfish Tower appetizer [$90, 4.5 stars] and my main, Shrimp & Grits [$40, 4.0 stars].  All in all, very good.

Service was outstanding.  I'd definitely go back sometime, not often, but in the every 2-3 years rotation.

A couple of notes:
==============
1) You can't see any live music from the Foundation Room, which is located at another location downstairs.
2) In no way compares to the experience of the Hollywood Foundation Room, now closed/defunct.  It was a better dining experience, and you needed to be a VIP or member to get in (or a friend of a member).",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,13,15,4,eB84x83jFKnX22d_c77nWA
