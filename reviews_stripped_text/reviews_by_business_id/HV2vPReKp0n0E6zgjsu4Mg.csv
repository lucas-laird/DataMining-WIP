The restaurant side is totally sealed off from the bar & pool table so smokers won't interfere with your meal. It has its own entrance from the street so you can bypass this altogether if you want. 

The bar side is a bit dark. Decent sized bar.  Refrigerators the size of the wall clearly display the various bottled beers they serve.

If I didn't live across town I would actually hang out here. Its a cool joint, good food. Fun place to come to after work & chill. Definitely a locals spot. Everyone is friendly. Doesn't get better than that in my book.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,3,5,K9iBd0jwfoQ6mmCCFFfTmw

872320,2014-07-03,0,HV2vPReKp0n0E6zgjsu4Mg,"First Yelp review....hopefully this inspires the whole city to try this new taco spot!

Garnachas just opened, and that is apparent in how clean and organized this place is.  They have a bar and a restaurant which is cool, a cold Dos Equis and tacos is always close to perfect.  Along with a perfect location on Valley View in between Sahara and Desert Inn, this place is destined for success. 

So I walk in the bar entrance and was immediately greeted by the owner.  Dude was cool without putting on his ""welcome new customer"" spiel.  He shows me the menu board and explains my options. I decide to get 4 different tacos (pastor, carnitas, chicken and braised beef"") along with rice and beans.  Bottled Coke is an automatic! Garnachas does the line different than El Gordo or Taco Y Taco.... Its more assembly line which allows you to ""build your own"" on top of your taco. Service was fast and friendly.  All of the tacos were hot and moist and had a ton of flavor.  Topped with Jalapeño salsa, i could've eaten more than the 4 but I showed restraint.  The only thing I would change would be the rice, it was kinda of plain and just hasn't as good as it should be.  The owner thanked me for the comment and said was going to have 2 different kinds of upgraded rice very soon.  

4 tacos, rice and beans and a bottled Coke was $12 bucks.  Leaving full and satisfied.  Free chips and salsa bar is also a nice touch.  Keep up the good work, I will be a regular for sure!!!",x2PZyTgaTY2Vw84-Wc5gNw,6,2,4,OneSAJCOyxRSLFbwbIYfQg

This was some of the best Mexican food that I have ever had, and other places at the same price point do not even compare To Garnachas.

Plus they cooked everything fresh.  Took a while, especially when they had to do different meats for each taco.   Very friendly and fresh and tasty.  Will definitely return.

As for the guy complaining about the service... I'm a little confused.  The place is clearly the kind of restaurant where you order at the counter and take your food back to the seating area, not a waitress table service place. This seems pretty obvious and clear, so if you sit down and wait for service you might be a little disappointed.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,4,1,5,7P1PLoy6tAwe7kjKQpfZUw

Anyway, sometime later, my friend orders a beer and that too takes a while. We decide to bounce and ask for the check. Again, a long ass wait.

I asked her if I could get something else as there was nowhere for me to dump the liquid (I don't throw liquid in the trash) and she handed me another cup and also complained she didn't like the piña. Lol. 
The food took a few minutes and I took it to-go so I didn't check it before I left. When I got back to work and opened the container I was kinda disappointed that it was more of a ""wet burrito"" style which I'm not too crazy about.

My challenges with this place is that my quesadilla was so greasy that even with going out of my way to keep it from staining my clothes (and face) I was unsuccessful. I also saw no sign of the promised roasted green peppers in line juice.

I will give them a pass on this as it was about 4 pm and i think they just didnt realize that it needed to be made again. I mentioned it to the lady and she was very professional and apologetic.

For all of you that are looking for a good Menudo after a long night in Vegas this is the place to go!",OpwsnXLy397Uc608dwmaNg,0,1,4,ZgA1Yf3GaMUYyOwoBKV_Pw

My family of 4 waiting forever for wack food. We were the only people in the joint! They charged $4.50 for side beans and rice. (Not a full portion) pathetic. Food is a joke. All the 5 stars are liars or don't know what's up.",fd5qqTYrcsrlXCGOe8ebTA,0,0,1,igD9NsUmT60slPZIDt4Hvg

That really hit the spot. Friendly staff and clean simple decor. Definitely worth a visit. No te lo pierdas!",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,5,jkaildVi6Ka_MuqDCrRafw

I got the Garnachos Nachos with carne asada and it was the best nachos besides the ones i fix at home. My friend got a torta and couldnt even finish the whole thing, she loved it. We both will be back and i cant wait to try the $1 tacos!! YEP I am a fan.",LSw5J-mDFXr75jmYmRnWow,1,2,4,FikUOIUcExspuuNt5jOeNg

We had the chicken enchiladas, al pastor huarache, and a chile relleno.  All of it was excellent.  Great green sauce on the al pastor huarache and enchiladas.  Want to go back and try the pambazo.

The gentleman working behind the counter was very friendly and answered our questions about the different dishes.  Restaurant was spotless.

Will definitely we going back again to try some new dishes.",FKzFdEF3UjkGJOm4LZkx2w,0,0,5,wQ636fvabqwKvDspqiP9KQ
