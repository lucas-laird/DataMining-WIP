But since when does it take 25 minutes to make 6 freaking chicken tenders ?! At 20 minutes I asked the cashier how long it takes to cook chicken tenders, she said 5 minutes.  5 ? So why was I still standing there waiting? It took 25 minutes.  I work in the food business so I understand when it is busy etc, but there was no one else there when we ordered. And someone who came in and ordered after us, got his food before we did.  Unacceptable. 

Speed of service is ridiculous, my boyfriend didn't even get to eat his food because he had to go back to work.  

Extremely annoyed.   I am not blaming the cashier.  I am blaming the cooks who kept yelling out ""it's burnt"".  And obviously poor management.  No one from management came to apologize or see what was going on.",NPNgrVURNstd7GgtzQcEpw,0,0,1,CXXkPiYHX4Ex7Hmjigru3g
2654627,2018-03-05,0,hJApSwheuQhctflM4fAhYA,I absolutely HATE this Popeyes!! Do not go here!! They never want to give you all dark meat.  They keep saying it has to be mixed and that is absolutely not true. The customer is always right but this Popeyes doesn't know the first thing about customer service at all!! Go to the one on Bonanza! Much more friendly and value their customers,17Uvpp4KLrQxKQuaTedJfQ,0,0,1,2kvv8lPMDgKD23V-XiX8oA
2884420,2018-05-12,0,hJApSwheuQhctflM4fAhYA,These pictures says it all and no I didn't order dark meat. This place is utter disgusting and have poor customer service. I repeat do not buy here. Old chicken and had hair in the food. The employees do not wear hair nets when preparing food,9QMbCXVHBbBjIuNoPHZ30A,0,0,1,Y8wchLNv6TXzgC9U9bgSdA
3230801,2018-05-23,0,hJApSwheuQhctflM4fAhYA,"I can't emphasize enough how TERRIBLE the service is here. I arrived and all employees, manager included looked like they HATED being there. 
Didn't greet me at the counter, order was wrong...simply terrible. Tables were dirty...employee looked at me and acted like it was MY fault that my order was wrong. A bunch of stuck up little Mexican girls. I am usually very please with Popeyes and spend thousands of dollars a year here. I will never come back.  
I think every job is respectable but these ladies work at Popeyes because they simply don't have the capacity to do anything else. Bunch of dumb good for nothing girls. Not even serving food. If the owner reads this...PLEASE consider hiring better staff or knocking some sense into your lazy staff sir/madam. 

Really might work for the type of people in the area but for someone who expects good customer service...this was simply a horrible experience.",0q2FtT-tMXI4JCJMn6YA4w,0,0,1,Ht8aglyoBYBTIJbvlG1oEA
