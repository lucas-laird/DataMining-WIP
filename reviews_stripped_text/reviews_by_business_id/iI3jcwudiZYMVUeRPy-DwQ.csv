It's not true what they when the sequel is not as good as the original. Better parking and not as hectic as the other location this one will be my go to. Now I don't have to dread every time I get a curry craving. 

Definitely try the takoyaki: warm, soft and delicious. Took me by surprise and made the perfect pairing to my spinach curry with a side of pork katsu. And don't think their level of spicy is on par with other restaurants, I love spicy food and normally get the max rating but I was pleasantly surprised that this had a kick.

But I am just really disappointed this time. We decided to eat at the restaurant and ordered the curry udon, chicken katsu, and the shumai. ( our usual order) So we ordered and sat down and waited for our order.. there were maybe 2 people ahead of us and 15 minutes later our shumai comes out.. and seriously it looked a little dark, but we just assumed it was maybe cooked too long so I took one bite and it's cold inside.. I called the girl over and said I'm sorry but I think these have been re-fried and they're cold inside.. the girl apologizes but picks them up and loudly says to the cook ""hey you, cold shumai"" in front of everyone as she took them away. Now our udon is out and it's delicious, no problem there. The chicken katsu was good too. But here comes the new shumai.. and I swear it's the same just re-fried again.. if I'm upset at the fact my food looks re-fried and cold inside, you don't RE FRY MY OLD RE-FRIED food. I took one bite just for the hell of it and it's still COLD INSIDE. so we didn't even eat the shumai.. so disappointing. ALSO, I get that this joint is kind of a fast food place and it's more casual, but it's really discerning when the cashier is just out and about chatting up with some friends who came to visit.. as we were trying to put our dish away into the bin ( which was full ) and we looked at the cashier chatting away and she just stared at us like.. what? .. so we just dropped the dishes inside and it looked like it was going to spill.. so, thanks for the udon and katsu, but please try to not re fry your food and try to stay a little more professional.

My friend had ordered it by app previously and scheduled for pick-up at 1130. I had arrived a few minutes before 1130 to the food was still being prepared. For the most part, everything was prepped and ready on time. Only downside is i wish they would have double bagged the bag with the 3 curry udon. One bag was kind of weak which caused one of the handles to break and drop on the ground. Luckily the containers are fairly sturdy so minimal sauce was loss. On the bright side, everything was nice and hot (also the reason why i didnt carry from the bottom because it was HOT). 

The udon was a bit overcooked (not sure if it was due to the travel time to pick up some drinks at a nearby place or it was overcooked originally. Otherwise, typical japanese curry.

The curry itself, was just OK. It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It's good to know that now I have curry as an option on this side of town when I don't feel like cooking, but nothing WOW about it. I got the chicken katsu curry, and I really should have gotten it spicier. It may make it better. 

As for the service, again, it wasn't bad. The food took a bit of time to come out and I felt like they could be slightly more efficient but who am I to judge. 

Overall, not bad. Not great, but definitely worth another visit to try the spicier version of the curry.

** UPDATE: I went back and got the spicier curry (level 3) and it was just enough spice. It's borderline too spicy for people who can't handle spiciness well.

The meal was surprisingly pretty good. The meal consisted of rice (brown or white) the curry sauce and one piece of chicken. Considering the rice is a pretty big portion and the amount of sauce they give you takes up half the container, my only suggestion is they may want to consider serving more than just one piece of chicken. When all the chicken was gone I was pretty much just eating rice with sauce. 

The spicy daikon is a nice touch to the meal as well. 

Be careful when picking the spice because though it goes from 1-10, 5 & 6 is still pretty spicy. This coming from a girl who carries hot sauce in her bag, orders everything extra spice and loves to just casually munch on jalepenos.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,3,1,4,l8WotdyMZHTOXTXLy24-4g

Honest never knew they even had express location or second location. Thankfully my yelp nation notice! So picked up on it from other yelpers check in. I read up on it and was like sweet closer to my house need go check it out. I am always paranoid when it comes to seeing multiple locations of one restaurant only because there times expanding can lost the whole reason why people loved it. Curry Zen the quality was spot on just like my first experience. Truly Curry bliss and bring me back to growing up in the 808 going get ono curry action. The curry by itself stands out for me. I could just have a bowl of base curry on top of two scoop or many scoops of rice. Curry heaven. Add the chicken katsu (they have more options comes to protein) perfect! It nice golden brown, perfect crispy panko crust not greasy at all, and spot on cook nice moist and hot on the inside. You can add lot of different things make your curry your own curry action. I keep it simple went with vegetables. The spicy level went 3. I think 3 has nice kick. They go up higher believe 10. I also ordered gyoza. It was delicious. The pork filling was awesome. It was fried perfect. You get five per order and the dipping sauce solid. 

The inside is lot different then the other location. It not so much restaurant restaurant set up but more of express pick up or to go concept. Not that many places sit down. The interior is pretty bland not much decor. They do have on television that can watch sports or whatever on at the time. Make sure you check out the speciality board off the side from the regular menu.

2360816,2015-02-08,4,iI3jcwudiZYMVUeRPy-DwQ,"Alright if you know of Zen Curry you probably already know they're probably one of the better Japanese style curry we have in town, than again that's only my opinion based on a slim selection I've tried. My favorite at least. This location is a bit different from the other location but nothing to serious about. 

First the price for the curry spice level shot up. It's no longer free for levels 1-5 and 20¢ for levels 6-10. It's 20¢ for levels 1-5 and a nickel more for every level higher. So if you wanted a 10 it's now 45¢ extra instead of 20¢.

Second their express mentality. You now have to place and pickup your order at the counter and you find an open seat or take it go. I would find an open seat before you order if its not slow. You're food is now served in a to go container instead of a non-disposable plate. They started using those styrofoam containers but the last couple times there they were using some plastic containers. I'd rather have it on a plate especially if I'm dining in. Instead of each table having a full assortment of toppings and spices to add to your curry theres just one used by everyone. The most you'll get in terms of customer service is when your at the counter or if you need more water, if it's not to busy they might come to your table. Thats about the only difference. The food taste the same to me and besides the spice levels prices the prices look the same.

The curry sauce is delicious on its own. I like it HOT. At this location I've gotten spice level 5 and a couple of 8s. It made me sweat a little but didn't put my mouth on fire it was just right. Next I'll probably go with the 10 or see what's the hottest they'll make it without killing the taste. The curry can be served with a nice selection ingredients. You can throw some vegetables in it or various meats, chicken, pork, beef, sausage, and even spam. There's also other items which I've never had here yet.

Honestly I wished price was a little lower and the meat portions was a little larger but they've grown on me and I like it, not amazing but good food.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,11,8,4,9_ttkvaQ8xSI1tDT-GusMg

I see similarities, but the katsu is soft instead of crunchy after being fried. the rice is watery. they present the curry in a narrow, bowl-like, oval plate which leaves less space for food. The sauce seeps into the rice, and I don't like so much sauce at once. It depends on you, how you prefer to eat curry. at the original zen restaurant, the plates are larger and it is much more satisfying to eat curry with. more room, less mess, and overall better presentation. love zen, don't love the zen express though :(",iZwoTW2DoMRNtpAYqChIFg,2,1,2,8vPl19QuiC1v6r_pZWeIGw

Your Katsu order comes with white rice and you can choose brown rice for a healthier option. They also have smaller sizes if you just want a single portion (perfect for lunch for 1).

With your order you can also customize the spice level to fit your tastes. I usually order 5-7 which is pretty spicy.

I believe its homemade as it had lots of flavor and compliments the dish very well. I will definitely be coming back here real soon!",UHHraFRu5NKvZqIHp2O02w,0,0,4,qEEpNriiVcYRVrnNu17RNg

Service and pricing gets five stars! I usually order to go, and they always get it on time. Every time I've gone, whoever was working the register was always really friendly and helpful!

Adding on extra toppings doesn't break your wallet, so feel free to add on. My favorite meats/mains to get is calamari, croquette, and hamburger. The hamburger is too bomb  The sausages are good too, but you only get a few so it can be kind of disappointing. 

The actual curry is just okay; this is where the Spring Mountain location wins. The actual curry taste isn't as prominent and the spiciness can be inconsistent. Sometimes my spice level is a 6 but fees like a 2, sometimes it is a 3 but feels like an 8. The flavor just gets kind of lost in all the heat.

2934860,2017-06-24,1,iI3jcwudiZYMVUeRPy-DwQ,"Aye baby, it's simple. This spot is almost as good at curry zen and I think the prices are almost identical. The only inferior thing is the katsu. It's not as juicy, but(t), when I got the spice and the curry and the spinach and the eggs on there, I barely notice. I really had to examine it by its lonesome to notice. 

If you never been to a Japanese Curry spot the closest thing I can compare it to is a spicy, savory (not sweet) hearty gravy. Early on i kept it simple, but, if you see anything on the menu that you might like, get it. It'll only enhance your pleasure. Scrambled eggs might seem random, but I like scrambled eggs and I like it even more with curry and rice and spinach and tomatoes. 

I'm a spice lover with a strong tolerance so, to me anything above a level 5 isn't worth it cuz I don't notice that much difference in intensity. Levels 1 through 5 are all the same additional charge so I just chill at 5. 

Also, strongly recommend the croquette to any potato lovers. It looks like a hash brown but it's more like a lightly breaded, crispy mashed potato. I usually go during lunch. I recommend that if you're pressed for time you call ahead, even if you're dining in. First time, I went it was empty. Last time I went, it was Friday.

I went and ordered a chicken katsu curry, then noticed they had level 1-10 spicy. The spice I am accustomed to in Japanese Curry is more of a slow, developing burn rather than the customary immediate heat of Thai or Mexican food so I played it safe and ordered level 7. The plate was delivered to my table pretty quickly, piping hot. I dumped half a jar of the red pickled radishes onto my plate, spooned the curry evenly over the rice and katsu, and dug in. I was SOOOO glad I only got a level 7. Don't get me wrong, the 7 wasn't super spicy, however, served over chicken fresh out of the deep fryer, it felt more like a 10. The curry was heart, hot, spicy, and very good. I think my chicken was overcooked just a little bit, but you won't notice if you soak it in some curry before each bite.

I'm not usually a fan of curry, but Curry Zen may have changed my mind! Generous portion sizes, affordable menu options, and varied sizes made for a really good first experience at this restaurant. Even if curry may not be your preferred food, you may find something that surprises you.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry with corn and cheese.

CHICKEN KATSU CURRY (4/5)
- HUGE portion size
- Spicy level 4 wasn't unbearable at all
- Not a lot of variety in flavor, but curry sauce paired well with meat
- I enjoyed the corn, but the cheese was a little much?

The cashier and staff were very nice. He brought our meals out to our table and asked if we needed anything. At first, the sides were forgotten on my meal, but that was quickly fixed.

What's to love? I am finally getting to understand the differences in different curries and Japanese style is my favorite. Curry is not created equal. I have ordered it where it is a gelatinous glob, this was really nice. They do have a  1-10 scale and I insisted on a 5. We have all been there where we like heat and every place is a little different. They are not playing with the heat so a 5 is hot! It is better to go lower then add if you want to feel the burn. 

What I loved, when you order the rice, sauces or meats you can adjust the amounts for each addition. So if you are watching your carbs you are not tempted by the 300 cal scoop of rice that you may have to throw away. What was awesome, the price is adjusted instead of having to pay for food you might throw away! This is genius in my book! I also ordered a small salad and did not have to pay a large dollar amount for a simple salad. That too is great!

The dining room was very clean and that is a good sign. My future outing will include a trip to the restroom because if it is dirty I am not staying!  My only mini dislike and it is personal, I hate seeing a bus tray in the dining area. The space is so beautiful that it takes away from the beauty.

I ordered the chicken katsu curry with a side order of takoyaki. The portion is pretty good for the price, so you can't really go wrong with that. The only thing that sucks is that when you request some red pickles, they only give you a small portion instead of having them at the table in a container where you can serve yourself to your heart's content. Takoyaki is a hit or miss because the outer shell was crispy the first time I ordered it, but the second time it was kind of doughy :(. 

I'd say give this place a try if you are craving for some Japanese style curry while you are in the Vegas area. It isn't as good as Curry House or Coco Ichibanya, but it is better than some of the other places I have tried.

It is located in a small plaza so parking might be tough depending on the time you get to the restaurant.

They give you different spice level options from nothing to lava hot.  Of course, you'll pay a little more for a spicier curry.

I always order the chicken katsu curry, fried gyoza, Shirakiku ramune drink and if they have it this curry pastry thing (it's pretty tasty.  It's kinda like an India samosa).

I'm basic and normally just always get the chicken katsu curry and it's sooo good. Be careful when choosing spice levels!

3948082,2017-12-30,1,iI3jcwudiZYMVUeRPy-DwQ,"AUTHENTIC JAPANESE CURRY!!! FINALLY!!!

I lived in Tokyo for three years and loved frequenting this curry restaurant there called CoCo Curry House Ichibanya. It was the first time I had Japanese curry made from scratch and it was amazing. Who knew curry could taste so good!

It's been ~ten years. Ten years longing for the spicy oh-so-comforting curry with that perfect warm side of naan. Of course I've made curry at home, but it's just not the same.

Thank God for Curry Zen!!! This place satisfied the relentless growing craving I've had since coming back to the states. The curry is savory, but not too heavy -- flavorful, but not overpowering. It's perfect.

I like really spicy food so I got an 8 and thought i could still crank up the heat. But my boyfriend --who also likes spicy food got a 5 and said it was perfect. Up to you. They technically go up to 100. Haha, next time I'll try the 10.

Also-- the Tonkatsu here is really great. Fried food is on point.

My only problem though-- which is why this is a 4 and not a 5 star review is that the food came out at a warm temperature. I prefer my curry coming out piping hot! (:

Still- the best curry I've had in the states. I'll just have to ask them to heat it up a little more next time. Worth it.",KBFQWewJglDvFbCww_UQWw,3,2,4,vAOtg_Uz5mUB2qcYiB5CUA

4002718,2018-03-27,1,iI3jcwudiZYMVUeRPy-DwQ,"Ordered the Pork Katsu Curry with vegetables and white rice, takoyaki balls, and the mango cheesecake for lunch. 

This is my first time eating at Curry Zen (via Uber Eats) but I probably won't order from here again.

First of all, I only ordered the Pork Katsu Curry because a few reviewers favored it over the Chicken Katsu. 

Big mistake! 

If I had to do it all over again, I'd order the Chicken Katsu or Sausage Curry, not only because they're cheaper, but because the Pork was so dry, it was absolutely inedible without the curry sauce. 

Second of all, the curry lacked a complexity of flavor. I did like it. Loved the heat, but I wish it was a bit more balanced. Pretty good but it was definitely missing something. 

Third, everyone raves about their takoyaki balls, but I didn't like them. It could just be my palette, but I didn't like how mushy and fishy-tasting they were. If you mushy and fishy, they are right up your alley.

Lastly, my favorite part of the whole meal was the Mango Cheesecake. Yum!! Other reviewers complained about how small the cheesecake was (and yes, it's small) but I thought it was well worth the price. It had little mango chunks inside that were so good. The cheesecake had a quality taste to it - all in all, very delicious. 

Ranking of the meal:
#1 Mango Cheesecake
#2 Curry Sauce with Vegetables
#3 White Rice (perfectly cooked, no issues)
#4 Takoyaki (eh..)
#5 Pork Katsu (Yuck!)",0ym7uySMBr-MrwCjps1rKA,1,0,2,fyHJ0vndaErwX-9qNJl50g

4107083,2015-11-17,6,iI3jcwudiZYMVUeRPy-DwQ,"I'd given up on finding good ramen on this street after hearing so many disencouraging things about nearby Omoide. I guess I was wrong to lose faith.

Curry Zen Express is an outpost of Japanese Curry Zen on Spring Mountain that appears to serve most if not all of the same products. However, it is to-go oriented, as evidenced by the lack of ""proper"" dinnerware. Everything is served with plastic disposable bowls/plates and utensils, even if you're eating in. That's not a big deal as long as the food is good and the condiments are sufficient, both of which certainly are the case.

I saw Curry Pan ($2.00) on the counter under a clear plastic cover. Having read words of praise for this item from the original restaurant but having never tried it before, I had to order one now. They offered to (re-)heat it, which I eagerly accepted, and it arrived at the table warm and fresh-tasting. With a crunchy breaded exterior and a savory veggie curry filling, it's not lifechanging, but it's a yummy appetizer / side dish that you should try at least once.

Instead of going for the traditional curry, I went for the ""new"" curry ramen ($8.95), which I later realized was on the other menus as well. Still, it sounded like a great idea on a cool, windy day, and the curry broth proved eventually to be every bit as flavorful and spice-filled as their signature curry. I again struggled with the #3 (+$0.20 for levels 1-5) out of 10 heat level, with sweat almost dripping from my head at times. It's a tough life with that spiciness sensitivity (#firstworldproblems), but it's fortunate that I don't have to pay more for the higher spice levels.

As for the other components, I was happy enough with the firmness of the thick noodles, and I enjoyed the various veggies in the bowl too. I did suffer a slight disappointment upon noticing that the pork comes as thinly sliced portions of meat that have absolutely zero relation to pork belly, much less chashu. Judging this dish as a ramen, it's good but not the best. But as a curry dish, it's a very good variant. Just make sure to add fukujinzuke (the red-colored sweet pickled daikon) to add some necessary depth of flavor. This complimentary condiment complements the curry the same whether it comes as a thinner ramen broth or the thicker standard form.

I will certainly be back to Curry Zen Express soon to enjoy their curry with rice and protein. Judging from the curry flavor of the ramen, I'm almost certain it will be the same quality as the original. Furthermore, this location does have a key advantage over the other one: it's across the street from the unparalleled Gelatology and a block away from the best-in-town Brew Tea Bar.

As faithful customers before the original location was remodeled we were surprised in the differences yet understanding that this location seems to be meant for take out rather than dine in even though they offer dine in. It could be that they just opened and will upgrade things later. 

***It's hard not to compare locations but the food is exactly the same and the prices are the same which we were very happy about.***

Differences: When you walk in you aren't greeted with a direction of a table or take out at the counter. More of a stand there and figure it out feel. You do need to order at the counter regardless. They have what would typically be on each table in a bar form (raisins etc). I was not happy dinning in to receive a plastic container to eat out of and plastic forks however, I did not receive styrofoam so that's a plus to previous reviews. *Even at their smallest they offered dinner dishes and silverware. Since you've already paid, if you want dessert you'd need to pay again so I think that's a negative for business. Once you're done dinning in you'll need to clear your tray, discard trash etc. understandable for an express feel.

A few months ago I went in to eat and I noticed a sign which notified customers they would be increasing prices, which I believe is acceptable. However what I believe is unacceptable is that the quality and quantity has changed and gone down!

When you eat in now, they don't have the pickled ginger available for you to grab from. You need to ask, and when you do, they give you a small spoonful of it. When you order to-go they don't give it to you in the order like they used to. 

The biggest disappointment is the amount of curry they give you!! They hardly give you ANY CURRY. Their portion sizes used to be much bigger! How can you charge more then offer less curry?

Yelp/ChowNow made it easy to order online.

Perfect. It will take about ten to get there. The order was ready when we arrived and we were back home just as quick.

I'll say that the prices are higher than I'd like, but the portions are filling. More importantly, it was delicious. The spinach really added some nice depth to the overall flavor. We'll definitely be trying that next time we make curry. I actually preferred my chicken katsu over my girlfriend's pork katsu. They are both great though.

Food: the taste was alright, my issue was that they barely give any curry and charge 3.25 for extra curry, how can you call yourself curry anything if you are going to be a jew about your curry????

Spicy: I got a level 1 and I couldn't finish, way too spicy, yet my wife got a lvl 3 and I was able to eat hers, I think they need to work on their scales.

Customer service: excellent super nice everybody lt made me feel very homely.

Local: as long as you sit as far away from the restrooms you are fine if not you will be smelling poop coming from the horrible sewage.

Their spicy levels are extremely intense and I love spicy food but their spicy level 3 was already pretty hot for me (so just be careful when choosing your spice level). 

This place is more ""express oriented"" rather than restaurant oriented so you have to go up to the counter to order and you have to get your own water. They don't have a soda machine and their water is just out of a water dispenser. So don't expect anything special. But if you're in the mood for curry or for something quick, I would definitely recommend coming here.",rYnHybeEX8U22M3waYztLg,1,1,3,I0XqsxPzlWWTGbuEUtn8AQ
5518148,2016-09-30,4,iI3jcwudiZYMVUeRPy-DwQ,"Yes, I know that this is Curry Zen EXPRESS. And yes, I know not to expect the same quality of taste as the branch in Spring Mountain. However, that does not mean I should be expecting any less inconsistency. 

Yes, my problem is the consistency. Why is it that when I order a meal with another, the sizes of our chicken significantly differ? Why does one get Katsu that's fried perfectly golden while the other is burnt around the edges?

I know the flavor won't taste exactly the same, and perhaps the sauce might vary from time to time, but the qualities that you can keep under quality control should stay under quality control. If not, then that's just giving Curry Zen a bad name. 

And why is it that whenever I go, there's this horrible, horrible odor coming from out of the bathroom? 

Yes, this location is close to my home, but is it worth it? Perhaps if you enjoy mediocrity. 

I say 2 1/2, but I'll round the score to 3 for their convenient location.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,8,6,3,wcEGZFMzr5jnqVtComQUFQ

Nonetheless when I first heard that they were going to open a location near my house, I was ecstatic. With that being said, I have really high expectations for this establishment. All of my expectations were reached!! Ambience, customer Service, etc. 

Something I'm not a fan of is that fact that they don't have proper plates or utensils. BUT I do understand since it is an EXPRESS restaurant. Another one, which I think might be a personal problem, but the curry just doesn't taste the same. Still pretty great! But not the same.

Zen Curry Express is one of my favorite places to eat! I always get the chicken katsu, small rice, and regular curry portion at a spice level of 4. If I go to a 5 it feels like I went up to a 7! It's deliciously paired with the ... ugh I always forget how to say it (the red pickled radishes and white onion root... ryokyo ?) sorry! The location is always clean, food is hot and fresh.

The 2 girls I usually see are really nice and they always remember me. The staff is overall super friendly and it's always a breeze every time I visit.

Food is great; I could eat just the curry over the rice any day. SO GOOD. I always get chicken katsu. The regular size's portion is too big for me personally, so I almost always get the small size curry with chicken katsu.

They finally made a Curry Zen closer to me, so now I get to avoid all the traffic down Spring Mountain *fist pump*

Anyways, besides the upgraded interior and new location, it's pretty much the same thing. The menu is the same and spice levels are the same.

You would think that after eating tons of spicy ramen I'd move up from a 3, but unfortunately I can only handle a 3 *cue sad music*

Also! Don't forget to order some takoyaki while you're here. It's mini balls of octopus which is a lot more delicious than I'm letting on.

A few months ago when I was there, food was great but the staff who took my order wasn't nice. Yesterday I dragged my husband to this place because he doesn't like curry but I wanted katsu with curry. We arrived 10 min earlier than the opening time and the door was half opened with a chair holding the door. I was just trying to see from outside if there is any one already waiting inside. Then the same girl came out giving me a bad attitude and she seemed to be super annoyed with me showing up 10 min earlier than opening time. I wasn't forcing to get it or I wasn't mad that they didn't take my order. If she would explain in a nice way, I could wait in my car. But she just let me in and I sat down to wait till their opening time. As soon as she let me in, she locked the door turning to the kitchen still showing bad attitude. Then a little kid appeared in front of the door and checked to see if the door is open. Again, she seemed to be super annoyed with those kids and the family who showed up early. I heard she was saying something to another staff there when I was sitting in the dining area. The place is not big so... My face turned red and I couldn't stand any more, stood up, unlocked the door, and left. 

Restaurant is in a service industry. Customers don't deserve to start a bad day because of the server's bad service and attitude when they are trying to spend a quality time with their family and with good food. I'm not coming back to this place. 2 stars are for the food I tasted last time. I'm not coming back to this location.",Az_1cFSlrWBA1g-qpntWnQ,5,0,2,Do2mJGP5UoCZPgpUUuZdCA

The portion sizes are pretty good. The price point honestly can get a little expensive. You start at $6.95 and just go up from there. 
I ended up getting the grilled chicken curry($9.95), added spinach ($2.50), and an egg ($4.50). Easily $16. 
I don't really have a frame of reference for another similar spot to do a price comparison. I would consider this fair for what you get though. 
I'll be back on a day I'm hungry. I'll even ask for a box to put the leftover curry in (because there is so much of it) and I'll definitely make some rice at home to finish it off. 
The mix and match possibilities are endless.

I'm glad that they have Curry Zen Express on this side of town, and its not too far from my house. This place is not as good as the Chinatown location, but it is good enough. For the most part the curry tastes the same, but sometimes I feel like there is a bit of sweetness in the curry. I dislike that because I really don't think curry should be sweet, LOL.

They have all the main toppings that I like - Chicken Katsu, Kurobuta Sausage, Beef, Spam, and Steamed Tofu. If you order take out, I suggest calling in your order because sometimes the wait can be long. Also, you may want to request to have the curry on the side. Otherwise, they just pour the curry in the plastic to go containers along with the rice and toppings. The first time I ordered take out from here, I didn't know that they don't pack the curry separately (they do at the Chinatown location). When I got home, the rice was kind of soggy. 

Service is always friendly and parking is not a problem. However, the one complaint that I have about this place is that 50% of the time, they don't have any brown rice! Its like they always make just one batch of it and call it a day. Please get an extra rice cooker and make more brown rice!
