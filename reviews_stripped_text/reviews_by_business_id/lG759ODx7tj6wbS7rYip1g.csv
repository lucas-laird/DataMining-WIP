I've dined in about 4 times and each time it was pretty slow inside but unlike the other reviewers, we had very quick service.  Actually, my entree came out while I was still eating appetizer & soup so I was kind of sad.  lol.  

I LOVE the decor.  It's not over the top, pretending like we're actually IN Thailand, but it's dark & sensual & usually very quiet, a great place to take a date.  The staff is super friendly and actually speak English too!  

I am vegan (no meat, no egg, no dairy) and I order all kinds of special dishes and they never mess it up.  My favorite dishes there are Pan Fried Glass Noodles, Galanga noodle curry & Pad Si Ew.  The sticky rice is AMAZING too!!!  LOVE GALANGA THAI!!!  :)",1sVC_xVc9aTzyYPLL39AZg,1,1,5,dYO6YUGdxJub4MnjOuYLsw

Food was mediocre and was served without serving utensils. When we requested serving utensils the woman was displeased that we even asked for them.

The roti canai was amazing, as well as the Panang and drunken noodles.

I love coming here and relaxing and listening to the off-beat jazz or satellite music they have.  It is so much different than the ""busy"" atmosphere of Pin Kaow.  And way cheaper too.

I also love the $5.00 lunch special!  I think a lot of the reviews who say it takes forever to eat are really, really hungry.  I'm in and out of here in 30-45 minutes.

We all ordered something different from the $12.95 dinner special, which offered an appetizer, soup, and entree, and desert. Coffee/Tea also included.

We chose the satay, the pot stickers, ragoon, and fried tofu for appetizers.  Very small sizes, really just a taste, but won't complain as the soup size was good and the dinner plates were full size.  Only thing that I wouldn't order again was the tofu.  Pot stickers were great.

Soup, they offer a couple different, basically a coconut and a spicy soup, both what you'd expect from a good Thai place.  Lot's of lemon grass and very good.

Main dish we had pad thai, yellow curry, peanut chicken, and one other thing I can't remember, except they were all good.  Spiciness levels varied greatly as I order a 4 (out of five) which was less hot than a friend that ordered a two and she couldn't finish due to heat.  Desert was coconut pudding and cream, sticky rice and ice cream and a banana eggroll thing.  All good, but I'd stick with the coconut thing.

Can't beat the price and the quality and flavor was a good as Pin Kaow for far less money. Unlike other reviews we had zero problems with speed of service, but this seems it could be the case during the busy lunch hours.",88jEmtSKSqzlREzKIVsd7A,0,0,4,9BAvv2Ja3BabMVc-z8ntpg

You're presented with a regular menu first which doesn't list the lunch specials that they have but has a wide selection of food. So I ordered to-go from the lunch menu here, which is a pretty good deal. It ranges from like 6-8$ depending on what kind of meat you choose. 

If you do so, I would suggest getting items that have noodles in them, as you seem to get more food entree-wise. I got the Pad Si Ew with chicken and Kung Pao beef. Both came with a spring  roll (I think they call it a Thai egg roll or something though). The Kung Pao came with rice as well but the Pad Si Ew didn't which wasn't a big deal to me since there seemed to be more food in there anyways. 

They do their spice level from 1-5 and since it was my first time I requested a 2 for both dishes just to be safe. I generally like a mild spice so a 2 wasn't bad. 

Overall I think it's a good place to try but I'm giving 4 stars because there was significantly less food in the Kung Pao beef than in the Pad Si Ew. But all in all a good place to eat and I would come here again!",_IckLY5lTT2eolJKCURX0A,1,1,4,t5A88gfzzNEYYTyBzvs1tg

They delivery and so far have never had any issues, brought me a free Thai because they felt it took to long, even though I had no complaints.   My go to dish at any Thai place is the basil chicken dish, chicken is ground not chopped which allows the meat to soak up more flavor of the delicious spicy savory sauce.  The dinning room is very tiny maybe room for 15 people, so I think they survive on delivery and take out.  Prices are very reasonable service has always been great,  However if your looking for alcohol they do not offer any.

The prices are great and the food is well prepared. I especially love the Galanga Curry, chicken satay, coconut soup, crab rangoon, ginger chicken, etc. I could probably keep listing, but the items listed above are my ""must-haves."" 

I do not like how stingy they are with the rice and if you ask for more than the single scoop, they charge $1-2 extra. The service is extremely slow, as they only have one server at a time and she is there EVERY SINGLE day. 

This is a Mom & Pop shop, it's close to my house and easy to get to-go food from. I will keep coming back as long as they are serving food!

They even have asian deserts and beverages such as boba and mocha ice cream, perfect for those of you that have a sweet tooth!

The place is kind of small and sticks to its description of ""hole I  the wall"" but is very charming for its size. It's a perfect hang out spot for a small group of friends after a long day of activity. 

My experience as far as service was awesome sadly I forgot the name of the waitress who served me but she saw that while I was waiting for my dish I had already finished the ""green tea boba""  beverage that i had ordered and offered me another one, on the house!!

I have never been so uncomfortable eating somewhere... it was incredibly awkward. The bill also had a bunch of numbers all over it and stuff crossed off like a large algebra equation.

It was average at best. The food wasn't bad. But it definitely wasn't  the best. The papaya salad was a little bitter because the papaya was a little too raw (?), the pad see ew was a little soy saucey, and the Tom yum soup was a little too sweet for my taste.

1697709,2017-11-28,2,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,"I would say this is my current favorite Thai restaurant and a frequent go-to for take out. My review is based solely on the food since I have not dined in and have always opted for take out. 
The portions are generous and price point is reasonable enough to make it a worthy option for take out. 

I love their chicken wings; crispy and marinated to perfection in sweet chili sauce. I do believe they have basil sauce option for the wings as well, but have yet to try it. Chicken Satay Skewers are also a great ""appetizer"", but the portion is so large that simply ordering that and a cucumber salad can be a complete meal.

 I am a Pad Kee Mao fanatic so it goes without saying that it is my frequent go to. They are very generous with the protein and the dish is not comprised of 95% noodles, onions and peppers like many I have tried before. I am a fan of the shrimp and chicken but they do have several other meat options as well as tofu if meat isn't your thing.

 I also enjoyed their Grilled Plate with pork, egg roll and fried rice...it is a pretty straight forward dish, but a great filler when you are doing family style dining. 
We are also fans of their Panang Curry with duck (extra $5), although the up charge for duck is higher, they are very generous with the portions of duck and meat is of higher quality. Lastly. when I am in the mood for something lighter Pad Woon Sen with chicken is an excellent, light yet refreshing option. Since my pregnancies my tolerance for spicy food has gone down immensely so I have become a weenie when it comes to spicy dishes and usually opt for 1 or 2 which are just right. Thanks kids for the acid reflux so severe that led to GERD. You are a gift that keeps on giving.
 I do plan on exploring more of the menu, but it appears I have found a dish I enjoy to suit my mood and craving at that time.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,9,9,4,a6NwFuNLDz1w8AyHr1o9zg

The service is attentive so no issues there before AND after the food is served.  They have 5 levels of spiciness.  So I asked for a 1 on the spice level for my chicken curry and swear my dish was hotter than a co-workers curry.  So what's the point I suppose.

I am staying at the Worldmark by Wyndham resort on S. Las Vegas Blvd. for the week, not exactly in the main action here in LV, and didn't feel like going out or cooking in tonight.  Checked on yelp and found this restaurant is close by.  Easily located their menu online (google searched: Galanga Thai Las Vegas menu), as well as lots of other sites with positive reviews, so decided to give it a shot.

When I called & asked if they deliver here, the (very nice) lady on the phone asked someone else & found out they do.  So I ordered one of the dinner specials--for about $13 I got:

Edamame as an app
Cup of the tom kha gai (chicken coconut soup)
Chicken panang curry entree
Coconut rice pudding for desert  

(Yes, I am in a coconut mood!  Lol)

Added in a thai iced tea (they packaged the ice cubes separately!! What a thoughtful touch!!) and then the $2 deliv charge, and it was still under $20 for delivery!!  And better yet--they estimated 40 min but were here in 20.  And the delivery guy was really nice, too.

I truly can't believe how delicious EVERYTHING was.  I wish this place was near my home in the SF Bay Area.  But I will be back to Vegas, and likely back to this same resort, so I will do this again.

Roti kanai- fried bread with a red curry zucchini carrot dipping sauce- the dipping sauce was not the traditional roti Kanai sauce. It was more of like a thai red curry sauce. The bread also wasn't ""roti-Ish""- it was more like oily fried flat bread- Not recommended 
Tom kha soup: onion, green bell peppers, shrimp, green onion, mushrooms in a sweet coconut broth- Very sweet and non traditional. The soup was very very sweet and not like the sweet/sour/spicy soup that is normally served- Not recommended unless you like things on the more sweet side  
Side rice: 1.99$- quite large portion 


Most people were dining out and in the span of 30 min- there was about 6-10 take out orders on a sunday night. Like I said, the dining area was SUPER small- sat about 30 people (which seems like a lot) but isn't because all the tables are crammed together and there is about 1 foot of space between you and your neighbor table. Kinda uncomfortable for me.
Also they seem very short staffed because there was only one lady working in the dinning room doing both the seated patron as well as the take out orders. SHE looked STRESSED out! Poor thing!

Will be returning for the peanut curry spicy crispy pork!!!!!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,4,2,4,uieN1Gt3zacGpjP-mPxmpg

The food seemes to be the typical Americanized Thai style food that you find in Vegas.  I will say that the atmosphere of the establishment is very cool though.  The interior decorating was very modern, mixed with some Thai decor.  Jazz music played constantly, making me feel like I was eating in some trendy corporate restaurant.   But enough of that, let's get to what really matters, the food!

The thai iced tea was ok, but a little watered down.  Thai iced tea is about the only thai food that I like sweet, and this was a bit lacking.  I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and sticky rice.  The sticky rice was very nice in the curry, but this was about all that I really liked about this dish.  The curry was the typical ""Pin Kaow"" curry; overly sweet and without any flavor that sets it apart.  

For dessert I had the sweet sticky rice with mango ice cream.  This was like eating candy; it was way too sweet.  The presentation was nice though, with the sugary cream sauce covering the plate and the rice in the middle, with a single scoop of mango ice cream on top.  Nice looking, but way too sweet.

I didn't finish any of the dishes, they were just too sweet.  The service and the atmosphere were nice, but Pin Kaow clones are not the type of Thai restaurants that I prefer.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,4,0,2,cjcWFITdxxbFhHE0dlTVXQ

3212216,2011-04-18,2,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,"Thai me up and take me to a different Thai Restaurant. The price and the decor are the only things going for Galanga. 

The RJ Food section gave them a cover story review and romanticized about the DIY Thai Iced Tea so since I am junkie for Thai Tea I had to experience this. The presentation was original with the tea iced cubes, but when I individually smelled one of the ingredients it smelled like nail polish remover. Ugh. Maybe my smeller was off so I continued making my tea combining all of the ingredients and it was a fail. I didn't enjoy it and spent most of my meal trying to make the damn tea taste better. FAIL. 

Now for the food, the only thing going for it is the price. My lunch was $4.95 and came with soup or rice porridge which fell flat in the flavor department. Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back. It wasn't so bad that I spit it out, but it was just boring. Nothing should be boring about Curry especially when you order it at the highest heat level. The sauce lacked thickness and spice. It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off. This white girl likes it spicy! 

The conclusion to this story is just because a restaurant looks good and the RJ raves about it doesn't mean shit. I will gladly spend double the price for authentic Thai then come to this fancy shmanzy crap hole again.",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,3,2,2,Xa0pcsjhqd-IG8ZzVEFjeA

First, Galanga Thai Eatery is located about 5 minutes south of the strip on Las Vegas Boulevard. They do have some parking spots that they share with the other businesses around it, so it can be difficult to park at times. The place itself is very small so it can also be hard to find seating at times.

One thing that annoyed me is that there is no bathroom inside the restaurant. After asking the staff, I was told to use the one at the car rental place at the other side of the strip mall!

We had the sweet and sour chicken (which came with a bowl of rice), and the Tom Yun shrimp soup and they both tasted good. Service was really good and friendly. Our food also came very fast, so fast that it almost made me a little suspicious...

Galanga is so tiny that there's not even have a bathroom, which is the one glaring inconvenience you'll encounter when dining in. (You will have to go about six doors down to a car rental place.)

The service: My bf and I stopped in a little after lunchtime. It was fairly empty, but then other parties started getting seated and the phone started ringing, so the poor lady was spread too thin. Though clearly understaffed, she worked hard to juggle everything and luckily, everyone was understanding. 

The food: I got the PAD SEE EW with TOFU... Sorry to say, but it was bad. Biting into the tofu pieces sent water squirting and the sauce was too heavy, almost bitter to the taste. Probably the worst pad see ew I've had. My bf got his usual YELLOW CHICKEN CURRY, which was surprisingly good. I was worried that everything would be horrible given how things were going, but the curry was the saving grace. His only complaint was that there's too many onions and he mistakenly thought they were the potatoes. (The last one is totally his fault.)

The Thai egg rolls were mushy on the outside which was also disappointing. My Pad See Eww was also too salty and I again tried to add sugar but it still didn't help balance the flavor. I ended up throwing everything away and just making my own masaman at home.

4137814,2010-12-30,0,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,"Found this place on Yelp- but actually it was after we drove to Miko's Izakaya to try their ramen but sadly read on their door that they open at 4:00pm (Open for lunch please!!!!) that we drove across the street and I recognized Galanga from Yelp. The BF is always down for Thai- it's the kid that we had to convince to eat there- thankgoodness they have Yakisoba (that won the kid over).

This place is located right near Von's (the Von's that Flavor Flav frequents) and when you walk inside it seems very clean with the right amount of Thai decor. Against one window are shelves with various Thai canned foods, Thai sauces & Thai pickled items on display- interesting!!!

Now to the food, my daughter right away ordered her plain Yaskisoba with nothing in it just noodles (the waitress seemed very confused by this request...) The BF and I each ordered a lunch special- his was chicken yellow curry and mine was shrimp & veggie stir fry with ginger sauce. My daughter's yakisoba tasted weird but she was happy so I was happy- I just thought the Yakisoba had an unusal aftertaste and not like Japanese Yakisoba at all. The BF's curry was good and my stir fry was O.K. nothing special. My scoop of rice turned me off, it seemed like it came from the bottom of the rice pot- i hate that!!! Both lunch specials came with soup &  one appetizer - I got the egg roll and he chose the cream cheese crab rangoon- both were good but too small.

I don't know how it will be with  the regular dishes but my main complaint is that too little food is given for a lunch special. The food was tasty but we were still hungry leaving this place. The soup that came with our meals was what we thoroughly enjoyed. We did have to send back our Mango and Peach ice teas in exchange for water as they were just too damn sweet - i love sweet- but this sweet was too much.

Their mango sticky rice is enough to write home about and their coconut rice pudding was delicious. Two stars for food and another for service!

I wish there was a bit more to it, but there's a noodle tom yum I guess I will try next time. 4/5 stars for the tom yum. I also ordered sticky rice and beef larb, which are my absolute favorites as far as Thai food goes. The larb was just ok at first and the more I ate the less I liked it. It tasted like they did not use extra lean ground beef and didn't drain the fat properly, and as a result, the juices were thick with fat. There also wasn't enough lime juice. I was sorely disappointed in the larb. 

I'm not writing it off though. I want to go back and try other things before I give it a real judgment call.

  But I am posting a quick review just in-case they open up elsewhere.

  I'm a big fan of Thai food, especially Mussamun (aka Mussaman) Curry.   I like it really spicy, and constantly try it at different Thai restaurants in the hopes of finding one that is able to both provide the 'heat' that I like, without it overwhelming the other curry flavors.

  With that in mind, I tried Galanga in early January, getting a couple items for take-out.   While the Pad Si Ew was OK, it's always the Massaman Curry that I use to judge the place.

 I ordered their Massaman Curry with Tofu to be very spicy, and when I got the order home 20 minutes later & sat down to eat it, it was NOT at all similar to the Massaman Curry I've had hundreds of times from dozens of different Thai restaurants all over the country over the years.   Clearly to me, something was WRONG with it.

  While every place might do Massaman Curry a little different, it's always had the same basic taste that people expect when they order it, much like if you order apple pie somewhere, it should basically taste like baked apples.

  But with Galanga's Massaman Curry, it had a very different & unpleasant taste that permeated the dish.  I thought maybe the tofu had been soaked in pickle juice, or that something had fermented before being cooked.

 While I do not know for sure what the problem was, I've thought about it over the weeks & the assumption I've come up with is that because I wanted it very spicy, the idiot at Galanga chose to save time & effort by dumping a bunch of Sriracha sauce into it -- that's exactly what it tasted like.    I'm no chef, let alone a Thai chef, but I don't think Sriracha sauce is a normal ingredient to Mussaman Curry, and based on my many experiences with the curry elsewhere, is certainly not used to provide the heat.

   But whatever the case may be, that curry I ordered from Galanga tasted utterly horrible, and I do hope the place is shut-down, but even if not, I'll never go back there.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,1,ast1rI_3_JdfPqr9qeQ7VA

5860006,2009-05-21,0,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,"About a 4.5,the only Thai food  I've had that was better ,was in San Fran off of Geary in the 80's,at a place that has long since closed. 

Lot's of style and creativity in the dishes (soft shell crab salad is the bomb) and,with the Galanga style curry, makes for a ""check this one"" out if you like well prepared Thai. 
 
One other outstanding thing I've noticed,is the tenderness of the meats is consistently high in all of their dishes.
I've been to many Thai places where the pork is  tough,chewy and dry in their curries.
 
This may be good or bad,but they have no liquor license,so it is BYOB.
But the good part is they are in a strip mall next to an Albertson's and you have a good variety of wine and beer to choose from with no corkage fee at the restaurant.

Probably the best Thai I've had in LV.",rt7gmCNCALr8bqQPluxeOQ,0,1,4,VdbAvFr6CD_5jDsfeciSpQ

5920706,2017-12-29,0,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,Worst fresh roll over. The roll literally had 1 piece of small shrimp.  The shrimp was sliced in half to appear as two pieces. That $5 fresh roll cost about 35 cents to make. It was the most disappointing roll of my life. The only thing that is worth buying here is the curry.,WC3QRTwChpJXiGNbN7mGUA,1,0,1,UpKh1AurdszLs9JyX4VifQ
5929404,2009-04-22,0,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,"Just had lunch at Galanga, and I was really surprised.  The interior is really modern, with some custom lighting, interesting seating, and good ambience.

The lunch special was 4.95, or 5.95 with an additional item. 

I got the pot stickers (additional item).  Even though they were not really pot stickers (they were steamed dumplings), they were EXCELLENT, served with a spicy soy sauce that went great.  

I then ordered the galanga curry.  It was amazing good.  They don't ask you about the silly number systems that other Thai restaurants use. I hate guessing what the optimum spiciness is at Thai restaurants.  I am not a cook, you tell me! The waitress asked if I minded a bit of spiciness, and I said that it was expected.  This resulted in a perfectly spiced curry.  There were delicious, fresh Chinese eggplant in the curry, and the sauce was good enough to drink.

I know it was only one meal, but this may unseat Pin Kaow as my new favorite Thai place, especially when you consider the price of lunch!",5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,0,0,5,DM9apazQ1S2dynmQcr5wUg
5937062,2018-02-16,0,lG759ODx7tj6wbS7rYip1g,"Food was horrible but at least edible.
Would I come back to this place to eat? - No
The service was ok, she was nice, but did not really follow up. 
Almost everything we ordered, there was something wrong with it. 
The beef jerky was hard.
The roti was super oily, the curry dipping sauce was ok though, and my kids really liked it.
Calamari was horrible- although edible- maybe we were just really hungry... this ""Golden Calamari"" was really disappointing though, there was uncooked flour in the batter, it seemed like they just mixed a bunch of flour with water real quick for the coating, it was lumpy and had no flavor. 
Nothing really stood out with this place, at best food was bearable, I definitely can't recommend this place nor will I come back.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,1,0,2,G7E7gYbckBwQNvBn5i_sTw
