Newsflash instead of pushing us away should give us discounts to drive up your sales",UYzUB1jLTMHatYN7_ypt-Q,0,0,1,hfxKb6_jHJc5_ELdgyAa3g

I gave them 4 stars for being in the ghetto or I would give it five. The manager was very helpful and the new layout is much better. Tuesday and Thursday are deal days.,z7QqaZ06ZWJrA7VdNws5TQ,0,0,4,ITGWMdBgifauhwIw_oAD0A

3000003,2016-03-14,1,d9N9po3OjG4AjyxOylFnmQ,Seriously the worst Del Taco in town. I've been to this location prob 20 times and now drive to a different store further away. I get shorted food almost every other time I've gone though the drive though.,egloSm9_5IaxShz9aX1-bQ,1,0,1,jwDSsaGPOdBqKeZxAhxsow

3985060,2017-02-07,0,d9N9po3OjG4AjyxOylFnmQ,Tonight poor experience. Three burritos extra with not my order. Patience on my part with the on duty server. Still my order was not what I wanted. One taco and one soda correct. Thanks.,5cxk_eDtMKHU7YOnZHzzsQ,0,0,1,oIP9zCkAFXSxiRS3Mz_QrA

But, I love their very cheap prices, and I'm addicted to churros, so sadly, I'll go back.",Cap3bkEK4rFnMl44i61BIg,0,0,2,JHf4jbU9PkKXRXLpk4q9vQ
4365349,2018-01-06,0,d9N9po3OjG4AjyxOylFnmQ,"Sorry, but this particular location at 2:30pm was pitiful. All the tables in the restaurant needed wiping, no plastic forks or knives in the bins and they were running low on their sauces on the tables. Had to stand up so many times to get stuff they were out of. Even their iced tea is in the back counter.

Drive slowly in their parking lot as there are a lot of confused, wandering and slow cart pushing people around. Felt relatively unsafe here.",UrQw8IyTOAAlokN-SMK3_Q,7,4,2,htZXrR4DBAXr8JecbtfW5A

Huge upset burritos were nothing but cheese and they sprinkled berly any meat on it will never go back took for ever on my order really bad service also full of bums place is smelly!!!

We decided to try them since we don't have them in nyc. Biggest mistake. It was our last day and we decided to have dinner there. Big mistake!!! I had the shrimp taco combo platter, which I assumed it came with chips like in the picture, I guess not. Rice was a weird consistency, it felt like plastic, the taste was super bland. The retried beans tasted old and the portion was super tiny. I felt sick instantly after trying my refried beans, which is not good considering I have stomach issues and was boarding a plane in 2 hours. I don't even remember what kind of tacos my boyfriend had but the avocado was already turning rotten and he also got sick instantly, and his stomach is a brick house. We didn't even finish our food, we literally ate our tacos and left. NEVER AGAIN!!! It's not wonder they were empty and Taco Bell is growing. I will never betray the bell again. 

Also the bathrooms were disgusting, I literally opened the door and didn't even walk in it was so bad. I had to hold it and drive to a casino to go. 

Bottom line, if you like fresh food, decent portions, and a clean bathroom, don't go here.",Yi5BxmlOg5N4l87FPFSTXg,0,0,1,-A4h21BQsgM8EPRUC3cZSA

No slot machine in the Las Vegas Del Taco ?

Come on ! who you trying to fool ? ! ?

I know behind closed doors there is some sort of strip club next to the tortilla deep fryer, I saw the reflection of a stripper pole. No bright lights or loud circus noises...WTF ?

I though I saw a midget dressed in the American Flag running around in the parking lot, but it was only my imagination...",pWmYLOVanVa37Ay-V9CeZA,0,2,3,jFkcr81yk_MmANMf4ZVGXw
