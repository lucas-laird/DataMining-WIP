I recently discover that their chain restaurants r also as popular. I had the pleasure of eatin there today. Kimberly was my waitress n I had a lengthy conversation with her. She was also from the bay area. She made my dinning experience at MC even more memorable! Thank u K! 

The chicken pot pie I order was huge n baked to perfection! The shrimp avocado appetiser was great as well. It came with the best chip I have ever tasted. I also finish my meal off with a slice of the famous MC pumpkin pie!",o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,2,0,5,okWJoXzGYKoDLSLuHvoouw

I haven't been to a Marie Calendars to eat either since the one on Decatur closed. Well, I am very happy we decided to come tonight. The food was just so so but Denise our server was phenomenal. I've been to fancy places to eat and don't even get the service that we got tonight. Denise was so attentive and made sure that we were always taken care of throughout the night and she was very sweet as well.

1151566,2017-01-18,0,o0OZwd1boPVWsmu6G4YL5g,I haven't been to this MC in years as their food and service was past their prime. In other words boring and dull. Today I felt like some comfort food and thought of MC's. I wasn't expecting much. What a surprise to find great service (you rock Lee) and good food. I went with the traditional turkey dinner. The turkey and stuffing were spot on. Plenty of it too. The veggies were amazing. Crisp to perfection. Let's not forget the pie;  German Chocolate pie to die from! Someone at this MC is paying attention. Good food and great service allows you to charge more for a dinner out. It sure was worth it to me. Well done Marie Callender's!,vLAYtY8GWMBkDLrLW7wu7Q,0,0,5,VfLQvsHDyXOh1fUJF9aUKg
1720459,2014-10-14,0,o0OZwd1boPVWsmu6G4YL5g,I give it 3 stars for the pies. The desserts were very good with a wide selection. The regular food menu has a quality only slightly better than Dennys or IHOP but the prices are MUCH higher. The cost isn't worth the quality.,Yq9TPm0y8Q-ACPAt4OB6jg,1,0,3,W5QerEdAxZNomUzZeSBVSQ
1732040,2017-07-19,0,o0OZwd1boPVWsmu6G4YL5g,Marie's pies are amazing let's face it. The lemon sour cream is amazing and any pie you get is going to be amazing. The tri-tip dinner looks really good on the picture but the tri-tip was soggy you could tell it wasn't cooked to order and the chicken that went with it was one of those cheap processed IQF chicken breasts. We decided to get a Caesar salad because it was happy hour. Worst mistake ever! It was already made so it was soggy with hardly had any dressing on it and like three croutons and barely any cheese. I could have gone to the grocery store and gotten the Dole Caesar salad kit and been happier with it. Then instead of getting macaroni and cheese or something else as a side I got this horrid coleslaw called almond coleslaw but there were no almonds to be found. It tasted nasty. They don't know how to do loaded mashed potatoes either they were very Bland mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of bacon and cheese and green onions on top of them. The waitress did a good job I didn't want to complain to her because the way the food tastes isn't her fault. It's the restaurant and these fly-by-night cooks that don't know what they're doing,TzSfSBL7hjjacEEb-YUN7w,1,0,2,aEj2AJiKxAVTw7TGQhutnA

Visiting from Seattle, we'd heard of Marie Callendars in grocery stores, but we had no idea she had her own restaurant. We were just looking for IHOP, haha. But we stumbled in here because IHOP was literally packed. We sat down tentatively and the waiter immediately asked us what we wanted to drink while we looked over the menu. So many options! And the prices weren't bad at all, either, which made me happy. When I ordered my French toast, I was given these huge slices. And my scrambled eggs were perfect. My mom ordered a muffin too, and literally couldn't finish it because it was so big. I think by price, portion size, and service, this place is fantastic. We did go on a Tuesday morning so maybe that helped us too, but I really enjoyed this place and am kinda bummed there is no place like this back

Of course, we didn't see it until after we finished our dinner. Our waiter, Sergio, brought out the manager as he went to go charge the credit card that my boyfriend so kindly provided, despite the fact that we shouldn't have had to pay and we wouldn't have since the manager would have taken care of it had Sergio not been so efficient.

This particular Marie Callendars is located in a pretty sketchy, old part of town surrounded by empty buildings and odd shops. I had no idea it was there. The restaurant needs a serious makeover. It just felt stale and almost dirty even though there was no noticeable dirt.

 I had my heart set on one of their famous pot pies but persuaded by our waitress to go for the meatloaf sliders, which I order with mashed potatoes. While we waited for a food, we were served complimentary ""cornbread."" I hate cornbread. As a fat kid, I was often told cornbread tastes like cake, but their's actually does! It was pretty good.. for cornbread. Our food came out pretty fast. The bun, grilled onion and cheddar, and mashed potatoes were yummy. The meatloaf was nothing to write about.. bland, but not terrible. We couldn't leave MC without a slice of pie. I ordered warm peach pie, and I'm happy to report that it tastes just like the kind you get in the freezer at Walmart.

Would I return? If someone else was buying.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,2,0,2,z9SjflkUMksQ5NJcGXb_2A

We were greeted with a smile and promptly shown to a booth. It's hard to beat their soup and salad bar lunch. The potato cheese soup is a meal in itself along with some warm cornbread. The salad bar offers fresh veggies and chunks of real turkey. My buddy decided on a Parmesan club that looked might tasty. It must have been, as he devoured it. The iced tea was fresh and the service was good. I haven't been to this location in a while and wasn't disappointed.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,1,1,4,lDUANsbKFjSMPJcFTl64lQ
3447521,2014-11-27,0,o0OZwd1boPVWsmu6G4YL5g,"This was my second visit to this restaurant for dinner. The first time I ordered an entree but added the Salad Bar for $4.99. I found I liked the Salad Bar better than the entree itself.

When we (my mom and I) went tonight we got the salad bar, sodas and we each had a piece of pie. Just the salad bar itself was $12.99 per person. The piece of pie was close to $5 each.

Yes the food is good, but in my opinion it is not worth the cost. Will I go back? Eh, Maybe. Mom liked it so if she asked to meet there again I would probably do it. On our first visit the waitress was great, the second time -- well, not so much. I did not leave her a tip.

Within 2-3 minutes we decided and she was semi cold/rude as she packaged our pie. Seriously could have gone to Costco and got a pie at half the price with better customer service. Disappointed in Marie calendars. Hire better employees, or you'll lose a lot of business.

Also ordered that night was hot wings and a side of fries, a turkey sandwich with avocado, and a chicken finger sandwich.  None of us had any complaints.

I like to come here with my Grandpa, because he loves the potpie, and everything else I tried has been good. 
This time I decided to try the Mahi Mahi tacos.  These were really good. I did ask for the pico on the side, since I'm not a fan of raw onions. They spiced them perfectly and even though when I first looked at them, I thought the pieces of fish were on the small side, the turned put to be the right balance of fish to taco ratio.  Any bigger would have overpowered the taco. 
They served tortilla chips on the side that were great, and a good (but nothing to write home about) rice pilaf. 
I was too full get pie, but Grandpa got pumpkin with extra whipped cream.

Service was a lil clunky today from our server, Leo. He was sooooo sweaty it was grossing me out-like it was dripping off his face. I'm sure he can't help it but keep a towel with you or somethin bro before you drip that in somebody's food. 
They brought my husband the wrong order. He didn't say anything. ..he just ate it. I had to ask twice for ice cream and my pie was cold.  
The coffee cups were so dirty and while refilling our cups they spilled coffee on my husband's phone.

I ordered my desert which was an Ice Cream Sunday of some kind. Took a spoonful..and YECH! Nasty nasty Nasty! Turns out when they made the whipped cream? They used SALT instead of sugar! Seriously! Talk about nasty! But wait thats not all! As one of my friends was eating their dinner? They found a surprise in their food. A human fingernail! Yep! A fingernail! Now we reported these issues to the manager. He did confirm that yes, ALL the whipped cream HAD in fact been made using SALT. In regards to how the manger wanted to resolve the issue? He threw up out of the restaurant! Seriously! That was his solution! And yes, he made me PAY for this food as well! Now how did someone confuse salt for sugar in their kitchen? Is beyond me. And why would someone be (apparently) trimming their fingernails in an open and operating kitchen? Is also beyond me! And to get confrontational with your customers because they complain about these things? Is also beyond me. Point to my story?
