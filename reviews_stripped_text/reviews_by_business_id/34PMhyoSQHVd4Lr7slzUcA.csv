They had a sour taste and left a weird taste in my mouth. Will never eat there again. I called to get a refund for my nachos and still the manager made me drive all the way back to make sure I hadn't eaten them.

The amount of the meat and toppings is a joke, they use just the corner of the spoon to scoop, maybe a third of the spoon if even that much. There more expensive also, the burrito bowls is more than a dollor more and when you pay extra for gaucamole you expect to actually get an amount you can taste in your food...Chipotle  gives a full spoon!

I was so excited that this location was opening as it is less than 5 minutes from my house! I went there very often at first, but it quickly started to decline in quality. The chicken is very fatty and the beans rarely taste fresh. The lettuce is commonly brown and chopped way too large. I was beginning to be turned off towards Zabas completely. Until I was in Henderson visiting a friend and she suggested we get Zabas for dinner, so we went to the location on Silverado Ranch Pkwy and Maryland. It rekindled my love for Zabas! It was so fresh and the chicken had no fat! It was heaven in a bowl. 
So this leads me to believe that the Durango location needs to pay more attention to detail and to ensure that their ingredients are fresh and of great quality like the other locations.

Anyhow, everytime I've been here, it has been clean and with all those windows is always bright and feels cheerful to me. So I give them a (5/5) for the ambiance. :)

Service is mostly good but then again I've never come when it's busy.  Actually it never does seem busy even if I do come at normal dinner times. I guess that's a good thing for me! Lol. But it off the numerous times I've been here.... There have been a few times with bad service where the staff was just very inattentive. (4/5)

The food to me is very much chipotle style. U get in a line and you order what you want and then u get to watch them make your dish.  Overall it's a decent place. The flavor of the chicken is off and on.  Sometimes it is so very flavorful and other times it's a little on the bland side. I guess it depends of who is seasoning it and grilling it. :/. There have been a few times where they have run out of ingredients at around 7 pmish.... Not sure how you could run out of crispy taco shells.  They have also run out of brown rice on occasion.... So minus 1 star for not stocking food items properly. Minus .5 star for inconsistency.  The Zalapeno balls are yummilicious! I get them everytime i go. It's got a crispy skin and the flavor of the jalapeno mixed with the potato is so delicious in the creamy center!! (3.5/5)

3482812,2017-04-08,0,34PMhyoSQHVd4Lr7slzUcA,"BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY! 

I used to be a dedicated Chipotle addict. I once ate at Chipotle over 80 times in a single year (yes I kept track). But one day, I decided to try Zabas. I'll never go back to Chipotle again.

For those unfamiliar, Zabas essentially does everything that Chipotle does, but better. You have your standard choices of a bowl, burrito, tacos, the usual. Where Zabas starts to impress is their protein selection. Just like Chipotle, they have chicken, steak, and barbacoa, all prepared in essentially the same way as Chipotle. But brace yourself, because Zabas has SHRIMP and FISH! This means, you can have shrimp tacos, fish tacos, or a specialty that they advertise, a ""surf and turf"" (steak and shrimp) burrito. It's phenomenal!

Another thing that puts Zabas over the top is that they offer POTATOES! Both regular and sweet potatoes that can be added to any dish. And it doesn't cost extra! It may not seem like a big deal, but this added starch and texture really takes a burrito or a bowl to another level. If you're lucky enough to get them fresh out of the fryer, it's orgasmic. 

THE BEST THING ZABAS HAS TO OFFER IS THE CILANTRO PESTO. OH MY F***ING GOD! This is the greatest sauce I've ever had on anything, ever. I'm not over-exaggerating. I would drink this s**t by the gallon. If you love cilantro and lime, you're doing yourself a massive disservice by not ordering it. I always ask for extra, and I have zero regrets. 

Overall, considering the prices are almost identical to Chipotle, once you try Zabas, you will see the light and become a devout follower like myself. I would give them 10 starts in Yelp if I could. IT'S THAT F***ING GOOD! Do yourself a favor and have a meal worth remembering today. Eat Zabas!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,5,4imM24OT_BpoEsk6snmBGQ

The boyfriend is a big meat eater and he always gets double steak and chicken in his burrito, which they are happy to charge for. He always has to ask them to add more,  to which they always seem super annoyed. I get their queso (which is very yummy) in my burrito, which they are also happy to charge for. The last time i ordered it they barely put any on there,  and i asked for a little more, which was granted with a scowl, and barely added more.  At the end she charged  me twice for the barely - there queso. All together with a veggie burrito,  a double meat burrito,  one large drink,  and chips and queso the bill was nearly $40.

4265494,2015-12-23,2,34PMhyoSQHVd4Lr7slzUcA,"This place looks like Chipotle, but they've got a few other options like fish tacos and nachos. I got the bowl with shredded beef which was alright. The red salsa, I probably asked for four scoops thinking it'd be like chipotle. But it is actually  3x spicier. Yeah, I'm sweating from my nose right now thinking and talking about it because I was in for a surprise when I took a bite of my burrito bowl. So, that's an FYI for ya if you like spicy red sauce. 

The fish taco was oh Kay. The fried codfish was awesome, but the sauces in the taco were just average, and I especially wasn't fond of the tortilla. It's bought apparently, and you can tell.

Service was good, restaurant is clean. I was passing by and starving so I gave it a shot. 

I'd give a solid 2.5 stars for this place. Would I come back? I guess I'd rather go to a hole-in-the wall or taco truck. $3.45 for a taco is quite pricey when it tastes just OK. The question comes down to chipotle or this place, as that would be a fair comparison. 

I think the shredded beef was delicious and possibly tastier. The portion was a bit smaller, and price is competitive. I'm kinda sold on chipotle's red sauce, so that might tip me over a tad bit. But if you're looking for some quick fish tacos in the area, I'd give this place a shot.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,3,2,3,iooDdNJyMx-xz652yAN8-A

As I'm speaking the girl kept putting in the wrong ingredients.  She tossed the bowls over to another girl who did not understand English and obviously could not speak a word of it.  The new girl couldn't understand red sauce.  The third girl working the register came over and finished off the order. (still incorrectly)  When I asked for the special celebrating 9 years in business, I was told I had to have the printout.  I had left the printout in the car and I was on a lunch hour and didn't have time to go back and get it, much less hold up the line.  The girl behind the register would not give me the special even though I frequent this Zaba's a lot and have been a good customer ever since Zaba's opened in Vegas!  

As I was telling my daughter what happened she mentioned that last week she had been overcharged but was on her lunch hour and said nothing.
