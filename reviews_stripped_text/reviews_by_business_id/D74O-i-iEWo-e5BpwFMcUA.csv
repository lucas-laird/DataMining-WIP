They have this some kind of smell that you really don't enjoy  what your eating because the inside takes over the whole place. I a m not sure what kind of cleaning chemicals they used but that need to change it right now. we go to another location right by fort Apache & Flamingo. The sad part is we live next to this one. Honestly waiting for it to open now heartbroken because we have to drive further. Please figure out what that smell we would gladly come back to eat at your location. 
Thank you.. We like this place by the way.",xjdf8Iwqg8ZUYncuA574UQ,0,0,3,saVizjsHqRrGTjhcGOXObQ

Awesome food - same as every other location (except Durango and DI - hate that one) and great staff.

ONE SUGGESTION!!! -- Turn down the volume on your drive through speaker. The neighbors (houses behind you) are WAY too close for you to be that loud. If I lived there, your speaker would be missing by now. (kidding) (no I'm not)

Also, love the carnitas plate...always a generous portion along with the great beans and rice...as good as spending a fortune at Via Mercados, (A place that used to be very good, but now just a step up from Taco Bell, and it's never under $80. For our family of 3 (no liquor either!!)

Well when I first pulled up to the window the IDIOT say give me one moment.  Ok fine maybe he was still assisting someone, finishing up counting, or whatever it was that he needed to do I was ok with that.  Then the IDIOT comes back and say 
""YES""?  I said excuse me are ready to take my order or are you ready to help me now?  The IDIOT says yeah go ahead.  I placed my order for my food and pulled around to the window.  He never came to the window but I could hear him talking to someone else and sounded like they were making my food.  When the IDIOT finally comes to the drive thru window with his ugly angry face he gave me the total and gave me my bag.  Took my card, charged it, and then handed me back my card.  He never asked me if I wanted condiments but I see in the bag he has already given me green salsa.  Perfect now can I have 1 more to go with my food since you  already assumed that is the one I wanted.  He then says there is some in the bag I said no I want one more.  So the IDIOT with his mean ugly face went and got me another one and slammed the window. 

Never a thank you, have a great day, or anything else you need.  This has been the worst service I have ever received in my entire life!  You have taken a job to where you have to serve people and their needs when they come into the business that you are currently employed.  I don't care what kind of mood or day you are having you need to put on that face and do the job you were hired to do!  Period and no ifs ands or butts about it.  I hate when I receive horrible rude service from anybody and I always give what I would like to receive.  

I will NEVER EVER come here to this Roberto's again and will try the one a little further down on Fort Apache.  I know if I call and talk to the manager it will be in vain cuz they probably could care less anyway so I'll put the horrible service I received from the stupid rude ugly IDIOT I received today.

It's the third time this non-customer service trained employee keeps making a bean, bacon and cheese burrito order into been, eggs and cheese and continues to try to have me order potatoes instead of bacon and argues with me about something so simple. He heard my order clearly,repeated it, but is stuck on continuing to make my order a bean, egg and cheese. When I pull up to the window he reaches for my money and I ask him first about my order. He said he can't make it.

She's the nice one and knows how make this an in and out pleasant process. This guy whoever he is needs to stay away from taking peoples orders cause he has no clue. To top it off he said that Roberto's does have cheese, bacon or beans and cannot make the burrito, wow. Those ingredients are majority of everything they put together just in various orders. Ridiculous & just pathetic. Crazy thing is when I first ordered this 2 years ago he took the order and put it together. Regardless if my order is not on the menu because it's been made time and time again. Such a frustrating experience that has me not ordering from Roberto's ever again. Even after seeing them make the news for having roaches and a unclean locations I still supported them.

Now I've been to other locations before and was not at all impressed with their food. However, at this location, the food was actually good. I'm not exactly sure if it was because I was super hungry so anything would have taste good to me at that time. Or it was because the food was actually good. 

The wait for my food took longer than I would have expected. I was sitting in the restaurant for a good 15 -20 mins before I received my take out. I was going to eat there at the location, however there was some ruckus going on outside.

3134560,2017-11-19,0,D74O-i-iEWo-e5BpwFMcUA,"I wanted something for a fast breakfast and thought of coming here since we live off Hualapai Way. The first thing I dislike about this location you can't watch them grill the food (like the Rainbow and Sunset location).  I ordered my usual bacon breakfast burrito and came home to find they put french fries in my burrito instead of the cubed potato from off the grill.  So I called and told them there's a mistake, I think the young man with glasses that took our order answered. At first, he was apologetic.

I said Hola and handed him the takeout bag.  He brings it to the back to the cook and then he's looking for me and I had stepped aside out of courtesy of other customers.  He looks for me and I approached the counter and says there were potatoes in there, I said yes but there FRIED.  He starts raising his voice at me, sticks his chest out and says, ""That's how they come!"".  My heart was pounding at this point, I felt he was being completely rude.  I didn't even get a chance to explain anything, he was talking over me.  My boyfriend walks up from behind me after he parked the car.  He asked the young guy WHO he was talking to with an attitude? This kid says I don't ""got"" an attitude in a calm soft voice, shakes his head and then ROLLS HIS EYES.  I said to him you just raised your voice to me, nothing for an apology. He escalated the situation for no reason.

All the customers are starring by now and so are the employees.   I'm glad my boyfriend came with me.  I honestly can't have long french fries out of the deep fryer because I have a corn ALLERGY and that's why my food had not been eaten. I take my allergy meds to avoid the hives and being hospitalized, I take it very seriously.  The cooks at the other location have always cooked the food in front of me on the grill and it's cubed/square potatoes, not long french fries. They just tried to cut corners and that would have been a big mistake.

Anyway, a young lady employee whom I've met before sees what's happening, she de-escalated the situation by returning our money since he couldn't handle speaking to me like a normal human being. This place is always hit or miss, I just rather not bother coming here when they raise prices and tried embarrassing me in front of other customers. We ended up going to Cracked Egg at Rainbow & Sunset for a real breakfast $4 more. Leave your attitude at home. There are 5 other BETTER taco shops in a 1-2 mile radius, there's no need to make me feel so little!

UPDATE: I didn't notice until now the receipt on our end table says his name is Rolando.  Alejandra was the young woman who helped us.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,3,0,1,lQggas2ArAvvoTGjPE0SKA

The rice was bland as well so the entire burrito has no flavor. The nachos were full of meat but the very little cheese they placed had not been melted so it was minimal cold cheese. Yikes I've eating good quality Mexican food and low budget Mexican food and it fell way short of that sadly. If you really are craving Mexican Tacos take the Trip to Tacos el Gordo. Those lack nothing at all, if you want simple Mexican or Nachos and I mean real nachos go to Tacos la Mexican on Durango and Mt spring road, other then that I truly don't recommend this place the soda machine was good and their side set ups was nice but truly this is not Mexican food Mexican food has flavor.",sL860YoTntXh5XvuYsWxVA,0,0,1,Rxj0jadebj17UzzIkVligQ

All because of that one older guy's terrible attitude at the drive through window. We live across the street and have been coming to this place at least twice a week since they opened. My husband and I were here the other night around midnight and again late last night at 1am. We usually just brush off this old guy's bitterness, but two nights in the row was no longer ok. This location have made a couple of mistakes here and then but we didn't mind too much because they were honest mistakes. We have been coming here since they opened and usually have a smooth time. The other night, we ordered a Taco Salad with no meat nor beans (my usual) and a Machaca Burrito and two carrot bags. He rolled his eye and smirked. I didn't originally know what for but whatever, he can stay miserable as he wish. We got home and realized he only gave us one carrot bag. I guess that was what the eye rolling and smirk was for. We were also surprised to have receive a very burnt Taco Salad shell. I thought I'd try it out to see if it's still edible anyway and maybe I could save us some time to drive back, I didn't want to deal with the guy again to ask for a remake honestly. Too bad it was not edible and I really had to return it. So I drove back for a remake and asked the guy politely because I didn't want it to get even more difficult with him already having a terrible attitude. He refused to remake it and gave me a refund. That turned out to be a total waste of time on my end after all. Again, I brushed it off. The next night (last night) as if I haven't learned my lesson yet. I told my husband I wanted to go back and order it because I started to crave it. We pulled to the drive through, same guy asked for our order and I ordered it again: Taco Salad with no meat nor beans. Guess what happened this time, the guy started talking smack IN SPANISH saying we're back again. First of, EVEN IF YOU COVER THE MIC ON YOUR HEADSET, IT DONESNT MEAN IT MUTES IT. Second we are not Chinese like you said. YES WE DO UNDERSTAND SPANISH, maybe just a little BUT ENOUGH. These recent experience have made us decide to NEVER come back until that guy is replaced with someone more deserving of the job.
