This place has got the closest thing to real Italian Pizza that I've found in Vegas. The Roman style is just that- crispy and perfect flavor. Their ingredients are quality which make the price a bit higher than your normal pizza place. BUT this is NOT a normal pizza place!
The service is spot on- the most adorable Italian female server (forget her name) she is perfection! Ensuring your experience is pleasant with her Italian hospitality.
Oh and did I mention the wine- get selection!

I can't wait to go back again.  Service was super attentive, friendly, and beyond knowledgeable.  Rocco (our server) dazzled us with his Italian accent, and answered every question we had.

The wine list isn't huge, but it's small and imported.  We had an amazing bottle of Chardonnay, but not before we sampled almost the entire wine list (note to self the $26 glass of Chardonnay is a $5 sample for next time) because we were unfamiliar with a lot of the wines.

Picante pizza with the Neapolitan crust and a caesar salad was outstanding.

59944,2013-03-26,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,We've been hearing about this place for some time so one Sunday we ran in to get a to-go pizza and were not disappointed. The bartender was friendly and took our order after giving us some great recommendations. We ordered the Bianca al proscuitto cotto on Roman crust  as well as the Tricolore salad both were outstanding. While we waited for our pizza (only about 10 minutes) the bartender provided us with water and great conversation. When we got home we could hardly wait to dig into the delicious smelling pizza. The grilled onions are the perfect accompaniment to the proscuitto and the Tricolore salad was perfectly light and delicious the robiola cheese was out of this world.

service: the service is wonderful. the waiters know the menu well and are welcoming and attentive. 

food: i have been a few times and have yet to try something i don't like.

mozzarella bar: delicious appetizer, great to share. i have tried the delicate cheese and the soft and creamy. i definitely recommend the soft and creamy. for the side, i have tried the olives and roasted tomatoes. i recommend the tomatoes, they go very well with the cheese. it also comes with bread, which seems to be a neapolitan crust baked with cheese. ($12.95)

margherita pizza: tastes like a very good margherita pizza, but a bit plain compared to the other amazing pizzas they offer. ($12.95)

bianca al prosciutto cotto: ham, fontina cheese, caramelized onions, oregano and aged balsamic. the aged balsamic coats the onions well and creates a delicious flavor pairing. the cheese is a bit strong (so beware people who do not like blue cheese and other strong cheeses). ($14.95)

tartufo: black truffle, parmesan crema, fontina fontal, roasted cremini, over easy baked egg. they bring out the pizza with the over easy egg intact, break the egg table side and then spread out the egg over the pizza. the pizza does not have a strong truffle or egg taste. it tastes like a pizza very well covered with good tasting cheese. ($20.95)

piccante: tomato, mozzarella, sopressata and fresno peppers. the sopressata is an italian salami that when shaved finely and cooked on a pizza tastes a lot like a very fancy pepperoni. combined with the fresno peppers, it is my favorite pizza. ($15.95)

chocolate pizza: save room for the chocolate pizza. chocolate sauce drizzled over the neapolitan crust, topped with strawberries, hazelnuts and vanilla gelato. it sounds overly sweet, but the chocolate is quite delicate.",6umPk0KOhYqwGYH00XzXbg,3,4,5,q31TXMgM-6EACWFDATAu9w

Great way to start a night with family or friends is with the appetizers and progress as the time allows.  Nice atmosphere.  Pizzas are great and with the roman or neopolitan styles everyone gets what they want.  

Adequate wine list as well.

190014,2011-03-07,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I went for the first time on Friday night with my boyfriend and our friend.  2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, mozarella, a salad and a pizza for $74.  The price point was too high for our taste.

The place has a cool vibe.  We sat outside, under the heat lamps, and had a laugh over the bright orange plastic chairs, which reminded all of us of the chairs in elementary school.  The dark wood, which so many people find ""modern"" is straight out of the late 60s, early 70s, especially with the ""burnt orange"" chairs.  My aunt's fridge was the same exact color.

The service was awesome, as one would expect it to be in a new restaurant.  Everyone was VERY knowledgeable and helpful, which we greatly appreciated.

We split the panzanella salad, which was fine, but certainly not spectacular. We did all appreciate the freshness of the ingredients.  

We then split a classica mozarella bar with the artichoke hearts.  The mozarella was good, the artichoke hearts were completely underwhelming.  The quantity of them was sad, sad, sad, and they were very lightly seasoned (to put it mildly, we found it bland.)

Last, our pizza.  We had the Prosciutto e Rucola on the Neopolitan crust, as was recommended by our server.  The crust was the perfect blend of crunchy and chewy, the prosciutto was plentiful, and the flavor was, well, pretty bland.  There was so little smoked mozarella that I don't think I even had a bite of it on my slice.  

We contemplated desserts, but with only 3 choices, and none of them all that appealing to us, we decided against it.  

We were kinda bummed by the lack-luster performance, as we frequently walk to Rachel's for breakfast and lunch, and Hokkaido for dinner, and we were excited to have a cool place to hang out and eat some tasty food.  But the reality is, for the price and the mediocre food, I don't see us going there again any time soon.  

I much prefer going to Nora's on Flamingo and Jones for salad, pizza and wine.  Their food is superior, and I don't leave there hungry.",SnJtzOlG9cbjmfI27nJjiw,3,0,2,s5I4RvbzCku7kLzw5pDhlA

291782,2012-12-05,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Really good Italian food!  The restaurant is on the smallish side but modern.  I can only speak to a few items on the menu, but what I did eat was ridiculously good.  I ordered the semolina gnocchi as my main meal, although I think it's actually an appetizer.  It wasn't as creamy as other gnocchi I've had, but that was actually okay; it was subtle and rich at the same time.  The bacon wasn't overpowering, smoked just right, and really complemented the truffle sauce.  

My friend and I each ordered the wine flights.  I had the Sangiovese flight, which included three glasses of wine (not full glasses mind you) of Sangiovese varietals.  The neat part was that the glasses were placed on a horizontal paper corresponding to the name of and information for the wine.  It was fun to try different wines without making the commitment to one particular glass.

My group actually ordered the mozzarella ball, the Quttro Formaggi pizza, the Prosciutto e Rucola pizza, and Speck pizza.  I unfortunately could not eat the pizzas or mozzarella ball, but they looked and SMELLED soooooo good.  The general consensus seemed to be that the Quttro Formaggi was the best pizza (or at least according to my husband).  

To top it off, we had the dessert pizza and chocolate lava cake.  I'm not a fan of chocolate lava, but the dessert pizza was pretty good.  It wasn't too thick, sweet, or overwhelming...you know, the kind where you have to have several gulps of water or other drink to wash it down.

Overall, a great place to eat and drink!",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,0,0,4,uEjuULZPQLrTpxvNw4veRQ

346054,2012-07-10,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Due Forni had been on my radar for some time and I couldn't wait to try it.  As much as I thought I was going to love this place, I have to say that I was sadly mistaken.

Let's start with the service.  Our waitress was friendly but probably annoyed once she realized we weren't going to be spending the big bucks like a lot of the other patrons of this restaurant.  She tried so hard to upsell me to get a glass of wine that once she discounted the price I finally caved.  I got it more or less so that she would quit asking.  Other than that, she was friendly enough and attentive.

My husband and I had thought about going the one appetizer and one pizza route (to not be pigs), but when I saw that there weren't any vegetarian appetizers we decided to just get two pizzas.  We ordered the Margherita Roman style (thin and crispy) and the Quattro Formaggi Neapolitan style (chewy crust).

Our pizzas came out quickly and looked really good, but after a few bites I wasn't very impressed.  For starters, I'm not sure if it's the cheese or if they add olive oil, but our pizzas were dripping in grease.  The Roman style was a little too crispy for me (and I love thin crust) and the Neapolitan was soggy in the middle.  The flavors of the Margherita were good, but the Quattro Formaggi could have used a little less cheese and maybe some type of sauce to break up the flavor.

Despite thinking we were going to leave full and with leftovers, we ended up eating it all and had room for more.

While the two ovens is an interesting concept, there are other places I'd rather get a pizza that cost less, and more importantly, tastes better.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,7,2,2,xCSmKcemgsES2cwS3PJBxw

359860,2014-10-24,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Selfishly I love the fact that much of Summerlin seems to forget about this restaurant because it's on the south side of the area. I am always blown away that we can get in and get taken care of so well anytime we want. They keep a simple menu since everything that needs cooking gets baked in the ovens, but the menu is fantastic. The semolina gnocchi is one of my favorites in town, and you can't go wrong with the pizzas. All that being said: if it's a mushroom soup day, don't pass it up! It's perfection.
It has a very cool atmosphere without being cheesy. Spaghetti westerns play on the televisions and Edison bulbs dangle in just the right spots. They have a couple of amazing drinks that are made in house that can't be beat (ask for the cremecello for a shot of sunshine in a glass) and a solid wine/beer selection. We generally luck out and get one of the same three servers each time, and they give some of the best service in town.

The Naples-style pizza wars are clearly in full effect here in the Valley and Dui takes it. Neapolitan pizza, done as well as Due and Settebellos do it, really shows how terrible most of what we get handed as ""pizza"" really is. 
So- the pizzas here (Neapolitan style still my favorite) are just great, taking me back to my first time in Italy. Start simple your first time and then explore the more complex pizzas. The main dishes they prepare in the ovens are really great so don't be afraid to try a special. I have had my pasta be a bit greasy,  but generally excellent.

We ordered the Caesar salad which was ok. Reminded us of pre made salad you get in the supermarket. Very bland, needed black pepper. The speck pizza sounded great on the menu, but it was hardly that. We had it roman style and we could hardly cut through the crust and to pick up the slice and biting into it was a disaster. The prosciutto was so much that it all came off of the entire slice in one huge bite, leaving you with a  few mushrooms and dates on a basically a cracker. My husband's wine was corked and he sent it back. They apologized and gave him another glass, but we were turned off after all of this. Service was attentive, but scripted and slightly annoying.

We decide to start off with the Tricolore Salad.  Plenty for two to share, the salad was light and crisp, and not overdressed.  The avocados were omitted, perhaps an inventory issue.

For our entree, we chose the Due Forni pizza - Roman style.  The crisp twelve inch pie was exceptional.  Fresh buffalo mozzarella generously topped with homemade sausage, fresh bacon, and garnished with a lonely yet aromatic basil leaf.

When I asked for water, she glared when I refused her suggestion for imported water which came at a higher price. She brought our main course before we'd completed our appetizer of creamy mozarella with freshly baked napolotana bread and roasted artichoke. Might I add,  it was the most unique and delicious italian appetizer I've had to date. As the quattro fromaggo pizza arrived, I was lured in by the bubbling dough perfectly toasty with a meld of cheeses atop. I hesitantly put my appetizer aside for a moment to dive into this delightful pizza. Heavenly. I had put my issues aside until the server committed a third offense at the very end. After charging our meal, she returned the receipts to the table for signatures. Apparently we didn't sign fast enough as she stopped by several times to see if we'd signed. When we finally signed, she rushed over to take the receipt.

I live in Green Valley so although the location is rather far it is literally right off the Town Center exit so not too bad on time. I should probably hit the Flamingo LVAC then take the next exit for pizza here. (: 

We ordered the crudo, carpaccio, prosciutto and caramelized onion pizza roman style, and the chocolate pizza. For two people we were rolling out of there. 

Very very delicious. I love my ceviches, pokes, tartares and crudos. This one hit the spot with yummy yummy olives in the mix. 

Fun take on carpaccio, although I will say the balsamic glaze was used as a decoration and the rolls didn't have much punch to them alone. There wasn't enough of the decorative glaze to sauce up all the pieces adequately. 

The pizza was super delicious. I've never had Roman style, very crunchy.

And after all that, they brought out the chocolate pizza. Died and gone to heaven. Perfect balance of chocolates, hazelnut, chewy dough and strawberries. Yum Yum Yum. Do not forget to try this. 

Next time I'll certainly try the cheese bar. 

Due Forni also has an enomatic wine system, like Hostile Grape and Noras. It's not uncommon in the valley. One of the benefits of this system that many people and establishments underestimate it its preservation of a bottle. On Due Forni's wine BY THE GLASS list you can find prices in the $60 range because the Enomatic system can preserve that bottle for a long enough period of time to sell the entire bottle by the glass. Some people may think it's a ridiculous price, however its about quality. Instead of buying a entire $200plus bottle you can try just a glass. I read a couple reviews on a different site that were really harsh about this and I'm just not sure they understood. Prices of values of wine can also vary greatly from year to year, just because you think you saw a particular estate on sale at Lee's for $30 a bottle doesn't mean Due Fornis is putting the same year/bottling in your glass for $60. Be an educated consumer if you want to throw around complaints like that. 

I also am a fan of classic italian cocktails and Italians love their spirits and liquors as well as their wine. Perhaps a larger portfolio of classic italian cocktails and the spirits they require might be a nice addition.",neAk3G8IC9Sdj6isy8GeJQ,5,3,5,M2NpIZOGBFzTXNHIjUiNKA

642672,2012-04-19,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"We live a mile from Settebello & LUV it (but the owner's always been a little off-putting).
Good foodie friends were in town, and recommended Due Forni, so off the 4 of us went (2 red-blooded Italian-American sauce-snobs in tow) for a late lunch around 3pm Saturday.

The design is a little trendy and a little masculine, but overall very tasteful. I love the orange accents (hand-spun water glasses) and the stunning lighting, as one other reviewer mentioned. The patio was too warm for the 112F heat, but would have been great at another season. If I'm nit-picking (which I always do), the decor & atmosphere might be a little schmancy for the location, but it wasn't uncomfortable.

The menu is the perfect size, not too much choice, but everything looks amazingly tasty. They have recently added a separate ""lunch menu"" but we didn't want to go that direction. We really wanted to try a little of everything, so we ordered the following & ate everything family-style:
- Mozzarella Bar (all 3 cheeses) with pesto, artichokes, & prosciutto
- Polpette (turkey meatballs in sauce)
- Octopus salad (can't remember the name, and it's not on the online menu)
- Pizza Romana: Prosciutto e Rucola
- Two hearty portions of the fresh-baked thick-crust dough with a light sprinkling of light olive oil
- mixed-in: sparkling water, iced tea, a glass of red wine, espresso, and a couple Americanos

My husband is crazy-picky about his Italian food (even pizza); I'm a little easier-to-please. We were both completely smitten. Everything was fantastic! Some notes:
- smoked mozzarella was too smokey for me, but I H8 smoke. The stracciatella was heavenly. The bed of arugula was my favorite accompaniment.
- Turkey meatballs were my 2nd-fave (2nd to the pizza itself). The sauce was incredible, and the texture was unreal. Even my husband (also a meatball snob) was impressed. A definite-recommend.
- I skipped the octopus, but the balance of the salad in which it was served was excellent.
- I can't even begin to write words that would do this pizza justice. Hands-down, the best pizza I've ever had. Even better than Settebello's Capricciosa because of the crust. Thin, cracker-like-yet-soft, melt-in-your-mouth...the PERFECT canvas for amazing toppings. I truly cannot pick a ""favorite"" aspect of this pie...not too complex, not too simple...you get the point.

BTW, I'm *shocked* to see all the ""this place is way too pricey for pizza"" reviews. Nearly every ingredient is imported from Italy, and it shows (& tastes like it). It's not like you're getting Papa John's. It's gourmet (I hate that word), artisan-style pizza, on a whole different plane than regular pizza places. Yes, it was pricier than the $7 lunch pizza at Applebee's, but not at all the same animal.

Given that, it was a bit of a pricey lunch. But, I can't argue that the value is there - without question. And, combined with the atmosphere, it would be a great ""date-night"" spot.",7EqszlEMGOBQxZTeveRXhw,3,2,5,ShfCDI-kv_81r3IV6Uvz6w

686918,2011-03-05,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"3.5 stars. The atmosphere is nice and modern, which I appreciate. The food was very good. 2 of us shared a tri-colore salad and a pizza margarita. We decided to see how they handled the basics on our first trip. The salad was good, top quality ingredients, but maybe a touch overdressed. But since that's really a matter of personal taste, I haven't dinged them for it. The pizza was also great. Nice chewy crust (we had neapolitan style), and like the salad, it's clear they're using top shelf ingredients. 

We both had a beer at the bar while we waited for our table. I had a moretti from the tap, and the keg kicked as the tender poured it, so I only got half a glass. But after they changed the keg they brought me a glass full to the brim. Much appreciated, with service it's the little things that matter! Speaking of, the service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. Although after we were done eating it did take longer to get our check than it took to get the food out. (Because the menu is so simple, the food comes out lightening fast, btw.) The portions aren't huge, so we weren't quite full after splitting a salad and small pizza. So... Dessert! We ordered their dessert which was just whipped ricotta cheese with honey and chopped pistachios. Wow! I didn't expect it to be so good, but I'd recommend it to anyone. Again, as with their entire menu, simple food with great ingredients is all you need!

So, the reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price. We had two beers, a salad, a simple pizza, and a dessert. I think our bill came to around $50 (incl 20% gratuity). That's probably at least $10-$15 more than we would have spent at Settebello (the only other pizza restaurant in town worth going to). But at Settebello, the salads are much, much larger, and I think the pizzas may be as well. So for the money, I have to say Settebello is the clear winner at this point.

When I went there, they no longer served it. I asked if they had duck pizza and the guy just said no. 

We went there without a reservation. The host asked us if we had a reservation, and then seated us because there was availability. As we were walking to our table, the host walked over to us and asked for name for the table. I just thought that was odd. Maybe their system is weird or something. 

The waiter described a few things to us. We ended up ordering the daily lasagna special which was a short rib lasagna and due forni pizza. The lasagna came out and looked pretty small for the price. The sweet short rib and lasagna fusion did not work out! It wasn't that great. The short rib was good, but it's just not meant to mix with lasagna. The pizza was decent- nothing special about it. In fact, I feel that the crust was a bit burnt in some parts.  

The service was really superb here. The waiter came around a few times to ask us if we liked our food. He refilled our waters a few times.  I actually hate when people refill my water all the time because i feel like it's a waste if I don't drink all the water. So, I told him I didn't want it refilled.

The location of Due Forni is really great.  Right off the 215, in a quiet strip mall, it's an easily accessible location.  I was really surprised though because the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night.  Good sign.

We ordered the Quattro Formaggio (yeah, I hate myself) with Roman-style crust (thin and crispy crust) and the Bianca pizza with Neapolitan-style crust (thick and chewy).  To dull the pain, I ordered a bottle of a grenache/syrah wine mix called Cashmere ($48).   I really enjoyed the Quattro Formaggio, the simple flavors of the mozzarella, ricotta, etc, went really well with the light Roman crust.  I would definitely order this again (well, not for awhile...).   I wasn't a big fan of the Bianca pizza, however.  The heaps of salty ham overwhelmed the taste--not a good thing since it was slightly cold and tasted like pre-packaged deli ham.  Bleck. Both pizzas came out lightning quick, though!  Don't worry about a long wait here.

Because we were slightly drunk (yup, drank the whole bottle), we decided to order the chocolate pizza for dessert.  Talk about a decadent, rich ending to a meal.  Neapolitan crust, chocolate, nutella, hazelnuts, strawberries, vanilla gelato, etc.  Very good, but I wouldn't recommend it if you order pizza as an entree.  I felt very crust overloaded.

Overall, I enjoyed it more than Settebello.  Pizza, obviously, isn't my thing but I think this place is one of the better spots in town.  I'll definitely go back for some wine!",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,2,1,3,_rBTzQ0H8ZGjAAwWm1Ychg

975764,2014-09-08,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"This rating is 4.5 stars, but I rounded up instead of down since it was my first visit. I've been trying to get my husband to  Due Forni for a month after getting recommendations from friends/colleagues about great local pizza places in Summerlin. I even purchased a Groupon and was finally able to get him to go last night. We had been to other local pizzerias and have been disappointed, hence my husband's reluctance. 

We were both surprised at the location -- Due Forni is about 5-10 minutes away -- an easy drive up the street from us and we had no clue it was so close. Another surprise happened when we walked in the door - seeing a familiar friendly face in Xavier, the manager, who greeted us warmly. He and my husband used to work together, so another plus for Due Forni. 

DF's has a nice outdoor patio, however, the wind was picking up, so we decided to eat inside. It has a nice cozy atmosphere, with cool Edison bulbs dangling on the ends of wires from the ceiling and flat screen TVs in the bar and main dining room, playing spaghetti westerns - which I had no idea what they were until Alex told us. Not sure if that's my cup of tea, would be cool to see Sophia Loren movies, or other Italian related movies, like Big Night, that would make a more pleasant back drop than cowboys dying on a flat screen...just my personal opinion.  Could make a diner lose their appetite. And while the lighting was cool, it was a bit dark and there wasn't additional ambient lighting on the table. My husband and I each had to use our cell phones to read the menu, which also doubled as a place mat. 

Despite the odd movie selection, the food was fantastic.  My husband and I each had a starter. He had the Beets Salad with basil pesto, arugula, goat cheese, toasted pistachios and fig vincotto. His salad, seemed to be the perfect starter size, whereas my Spinach Salad came out in a huge bowl.  It seemed to be an entire bag of spinach with fresh cherries, roasted walnuts, cabra vino & a light herb vinaigrette for $9.95. It was quite tasty and had some amazing mozzarella bites in it, however, it could've been a bit smaller and the high-sided bowl it was served in was a bit awkward when I wanted to rest my knife and fork between bites. There were a few fresh cherries, which had a nice sweetness to break up the bitterness of the spinach, although I wish there had been a few more, as well as candied walnuts. Instead there were a few roasted walnuts which had fallen to the bottom of the high sided bowl. The bowl was a wide funnel shape, so I had to keep tossing my salad with my knife and fork in order to get the other tidbits which sunk to the bottom of the bowl with bites of spinach. I think if they reduced the spinach salad by a third and served it in a lower bowl, added candied walnuts and a few more cherries to be more in balance with volume of spinach, and also add a few more pieces of mozzarella, it would be perfect.

While the salad was good, I didn't want to eat the entire thing so I could save room for my main, which was the Tartufo pizza on Neopolitan crust (recommended by our waiter since the pizza has more substantive toppings). Thee Tartufo was well worth its $20.95 price with its black truffle, parmigiano reggiano crema, fontina fontal, roasted cremini, over easy-baked egg was melt in your mouth good. The cheese was perfectly melted and gooey, the black truffle was delicious and didn't overwhelm the cheese or the roasted mushrooms and the egg was a surprisingly delicious touch. The crust was definitely far better than the pizza crust at Settebellos, which was soggy and wet. The Neopolitan crust at Due Forni was the perfect combination of a light chewy interior with a crispy crunchy exterior. I normally don't eat the crust, but with this pizza, I made an exception since the texture was amazing and was perfect to sop some of the truffle oil on the other slices!  My husband had the Daily Lasagna, which was ham and cheese. Something that I would expect in a sandwich, but not in a lasagna, and while it was good, I probably would've opted for a different meat, like a spicy Italian sausage to balance the creaminess and richness of the cheese. It came out bubbling hot and smelled AH-mazing and the cheese and the béchamel was spot on. 

We didn't order dessert, however, Xavier sent out a complimentary bread pudding, which was delicious, but we were both so full from dinner that we only had a few bites. My husband and I both liked their wine list and that all of the wines they serve come by the bottle as well as the glass, which is an unexpected nice touch. The service was fast, the wait staff friendly and the overall experience was enjoyable. I just wish I had taken pictures to post with this review, but we were so hungry and it smelled so good, we didn't even think about taking photos until we were almost done! We'll definitely be back so I'll definitely take pics next time. I want to try the Prosciutto Panino, it sounds delicious.",ov5Uuxy9OEkR2Tj14Lageg,1,0,5,YOhj0LzT8rVsP4UiLVWtww

992602,2012-03-28,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"We tried Due Forni for dinner during Restaurant Week. It's a good thing restaurant week supports a good cause, because it was not worth $65 for two. Not in the slightest.

We started with eggplant caprese: Roasted Eggplant, Bufala Mozzarella, Basil Pesto. It was very good. I want replicate this at home, but make it a sandwich.

Next, the husband dug into his Calzone: Turkey Meatballs, Mozzarella, Ricotta, San Marzano tomatoes. The dough was very doughy and bland. The meatballs were better than expected and I really enjoyed the freshness of the marinara sauce. I used it on my pizza.

I had Pizza Speck: Smoked Prosciutto, Bufala Mozzarella, Roasted Mushrooms, Fresh Parsley neopolitan style. Baked at 900 degrees for a chewy crust with crisp exterior. Only it wasn't at all crisp and bland as could be. The center was soggy and it tasted like it wasn't cooked thru. The prosciutto was tough to bite and it was a mess.

Dessert was more successful. Frank enjoyed his vanilla gelato and I liked the savoriness of the Sweet Bufala Ricotta, Toasted Pistachios, and just a hint of sweetness from the Artisanal Honey.

I've read review after review that sing the praises of Due Forni and I wanted to love it, but I didn't. We agreed that we'd only return for dessert on a hot summer night. If we could give 1/2 stars I would in this case because it was really only the entrees that were so disappointing. At the same token, they were the entrees.

Those are the key points to my wonderful time at Due Forni. We went to grab a bite and watch the rest of a football game. 

The meatballs were good. I liked the seasoning they used. My salad was great too. The pizza though, oh man. I wish I could remember which one we had exactly.  Maybe the Bianca...cotto one. I am unsure, but it was very good to me. Its a different type of pizza. I cannot really compare it to other places that have general pizza. Its unique. I do feel that there are better types out there, but it was not bad at all to me. 

Now, my favorite part... the WINE! I love wine and their flight deals were exquisite. We ordered two different flights, so 6 different wines, so amazing and a decent price for sure. 

The bartender was very informative about the wines and he was very polite, talkative with us. I like that in a bartender. Very engaging. I really hope he is there the next time I go.

They were discussing the roots of pizza as being a thin wood fired oven crust. It looked so good I decided to go on a quest to find pizza Napoletana in Vegas. I found Due Forni (through Yelp) which is about 20-25 minutes from the Hard Rock Hotel and casino. Upon arriving to the restaurant my wife and I were greeted by the host (manager) and seated right away. I knew we were in the right place upon smelling the amazing exotic aromas in the restaurant. The waitress came to the table right away and gave us a full explanation of the menu and wines. She was extremely friendly and helpful (which is rare in restaurants today). They were offering a special on a flight of three wines. The wines were excellent and $35 was a great deal considering one of the wines is about $180 a bottle.

We started off with Stracciatella (soft and creamy) mozzarella and prosciutto san daniele. WOW! This mozzarella was so creamy and buttery and topped with a little prosciutto, YUM YUM! Next we had the Panzanella salad. This salad was composed of toasted pistachios arugula, onion, tomato with balsamic vinaigrette. An awesome combination of flavors; Intense onion and tomato and then smacked with a toasted pistachio over vinaigrette, yummy! We couldn't decide which pizza to choose but finally agreed on the Due Forni pizza Napoletana style( light chewy/soft crust crispy exterior). This pizza had san marzano tomatos, bufala mozzarella, home made sausage, bacon, and pequillo peppers). Holy smokes! What an incredible pizza. The delicious pizza had a woodsy crust crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. The homemade sausage full bodied flavor, incredible. The combination of all of these ingredients made for one of the best pizzas I have ever had in my life.  I would definitely go back to Du Forni the next time I am in Vegas.

1056000,2016-05-01,2,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"We've been to Due Forni many times over the last few years. It used to be our go-to pizza place but the last two times we've been, the food has been very bland and the service less than steller. We walked in and asked to sit outdoors but were told a large party had just left and it would be a 30 minite wait because they had to clean and set the outdoor area back up. So we agreed dining inside was better. We were seated in the bar area, at the table right next to the entrance (worst table in the house), despite the dining area being only half full and the tables more interior in the bar area being empty. But we decided to just go with it. About 10 minutes after being seated, we ordered and watched as a party of four came in, requested to sit outside, and were immediately taken outside and seated. WTH?? I was annoyed to say the least but we let it go. 

We ordered the Margarita pizza and penne bolognese. When I've made bolognese at home, the sauce is rich, deep in favor and you know it's hours and hours of labor. This bolognese lacked that depth of flavor and tomatoeyness. The pizza was just plain awful. The crust had no discernable taste. None. I can't help but think they totally forgot to add salt. The sauce, too, was bland and was more like chunks of tomato taken from the can and thrown on the dough as opposed to a real pizza sauce. I don't know what's going on at Due Forni.

1255689,2012-01-30,4,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Due Forni where have you been all my life?  Quite possibly the best pizza I've had in my life. Comes in two styles Neapolitan and Roman, hence the name Due Forni or ""two ovens?"".  Excuse my poor italian. :)

Here are the descriptions of the two crusts you can select for your delicioso pizzas:
Neapolitan: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=U9bozWCAPoMsgD6A2KAgDA
Roman:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=4TSahuQoDAsDA4PC8B1jNQ

To start, we had the Semolina Gnocchi which had smoked bacon, peas and black truffle sauce and it was so delicious.  Every single bite was savory and amazing.  Seriously it's addicting, you could eat that dish for dayyys.  

Here's what it looks like: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=eT9UIn-4wzxAYPnGMzAtOg

Then we ordered two pizzas:

Prosciutto e Rucola, Roman Style: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=deH14nj-XsuXJswDmSV-8w

And, Tartufo, Neapolitan Style: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg?select=O-tyy_7TCsHzNgwJLO99nw

Both pizzas were tasty, the prosciutto was fresh and melt in your mouth amazing.  But the highlight of the evening was definitely the Tartufo.  This is the ""Egg Mcmuffin"" of pizzas people.  

The Tartufo came out and it looked so pretty with a nice over easy egg perfectly sitting in the center.  Then it our server brings out his spoon, cracks the egg and smears it across and around.  I was thinking to myself, ""NOOOOOOOO, what are you doing to my pizza?""  Not realizing that if he didn't smear it, every bite wouldn't have egg in it..

Took a bite and BAZZZINGA! amazing!  It was like a taste bud orgasm.  It was like a party in my mouth. It was like drinking from a fountain of truffle goodness.  It is pizza heaven!

My buddy and I literally were blown away by the amazing pizzas and gnocchi.  The front of the house manager is super nice too.  He walks by every table and chats up a story definitely giving the place a home-y feeling to it.  Its very trendy with a wide selection of wines and they have a sample that you can try. I think it was 3 6 oz pours of 3 different wines for $30? i'm not exactly sure on the numbers but my friend and I were definitely here for the pizza. 

It is a shame that Due Forni is way out on the west side in West Summerlin but if you get the chance to try this place definitely do.  It was a foodie experience i will never forget and when i'm back in LV again, i'll be back for more TARTUFO!",lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg,6,7,5,01wIao7tbpOoN0KQsg7lPQ

Gigantic pieces of fresh homemade croutons, house prepared Caesar dressing and a nice little touch- Pickled capers, the bomb!!

First time pizza, the dough was good the toppings missed the mark. The prociutto was laid in long slices across the pie making it sloppy and difficult to eat. the sauce was unimpressive and the pie wasnt even sliced. Do they really expect you to eat pizza with a fork and knife??? Ok so the menu looks like they might make good food so i tried the braised rib dish with ""creamy polenta"".....there was nothing creamy or polenta about it. The meat was cooked properly but the sauce was on the sweet side the vegetables were laughable and the polenta was just abominable. A teaspoon of corn meal beaten with some water over a flame does not make POLENTA.

1345655,2011-10-28,1,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Upon my 2nd visit here, it's time for a review!

Let me start by saying that being a native Chicagoan, I've really grown to appreciate very thin, crispy crust pizzas over the past few years.  Not that a great 4"" deep pie isn't still wonderful, but not what I crave.

With that being said, Due Forni pizzas are fantastic.  Top quality fresh ingredients, awesome crust, perfectly cooked every time.  I especially love the margherita pizza.  The basil tastes like it was just picked in the back garden.

I really like the style of this place too.  The modern touches and always some spaghetti western on the TV.  Who would have thought a little Clint Eastwood would compliment fine Italian food so well?

Service deserves 5 stars here!  The staff is awesome.  Very friendly and on top of everything.  You'll never need to ask for a refill of your iced tea!  And they keep their distance if the table is in conversation.  I hate ""interrupty"" servers.  (I know that's a made-up word)

Now for the sad news...one star away from perfect because of the little flies and gnats that were bothering me.  Maybe something in a plant they had.  I'm sure this was a fluke.  I may revise this after another visit if the wildlife is under control.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,1,0,4,1lV2xdMJPfKBJSdIw3TG8g
1351017,2012-04-17,4,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars for a number of reasons: First, they have great pizza and I find it better than Rocco's which I used to think was the best in Vegas. Second, we had some sort of cheese platter with various dips, can't recall the name, but what great appetizer. Third, I'd never heard of it and my son, who was in with his family from Brooklyn found it. He thought the pizza was better than the old Queen Pizzaria on Court Street in Brooklyn Heights, where he was raised and raised on pizza and I have always thought Queen was the best. Fourth, we went with his children (4 & 1), who were, and I say this somewhat proudly, remarkably well behaved, and they couldn't have been nicer in accomodating them. Fifth, I'm definitely a regular customer now...try this spot, it's wonderful...and the service couldn't be better.

If I were to have a criticism, it would be the same as for so many restaurants in Vegas these days: Why is a television necessary? However, it was unobtrusive, the Clint Eastwood ""Good, Bad...whatever"" notwithstanding.",o5WZkkTuNwMvDhfYuzT-5A,4,4,5,aquv65wXPfAbOAgFuffKng

Great wines - both in price point and selection - giving diners a choice of Reserve wines or a less expensive experience. We need both and they have accomplished that.  I had a table of 10 ladies last night and they accomodated us giving us a choice to sit inside or their terrace-like outdoor area.  Pizzas, Wine, Appetizers and accomodating a Vegan guest in our group was great. Alex and Bobby visited our table and checked in to be sure we were wanting for nothing and Chelsea is teh sweetest and incredibly professional yet easy-going.  The wait staff in general is great.

Each pizza was great, and none of us could agree on which was the best. The three we ordered were: Due Forni (Neapolitan), Bianca al Prosciutto Cotto (Roman), and the Tartufo (Neapolitan). My only knock I have is that the Neapolitan pies were a bit soggy in the middle. Other than that, all of the pies were bursting with flavor. The Tartufo may be a bit rich if you do not mix it up with some other selections. The service was great, as two different managers came by to check on us, and both had honest opinions and helpful recommendations.

For a unique pizza that you cannot get anywhere else is the Tartufo -
Truffle confetti with a cracked egg and that is spread throughout the pizza.  So by the time it gets to your table, you will see a marble of yellow and white painted and then drizzle with white truffle oil.

I love the thicker crust Neopolitan. It is soft and has a wonderful flavor. Some crust has a yeasty tang, this is perfect!!!!
We also had the gnocchis. Dont think the typical potato and flour combo, think a fatter short noodle. They toss them in a sauce with smoky bacon, peas and cheese. SSSSOOO tasty!
We couldnt choose what dessert to pick, so we orderd the chocolate pizza and the sweet ricotta. Amazing for both!!!

We have kids and have limited time for our dates and almost always default to Due. You can get in and out if you need to, but the atmosphere is fantastic for marinating a Friday night.

PROS: 
1. The pizza is true italian style pizza, thin chewy crust cooked in a 700* oven. I can't say enough.
2. Very clean inside, including bathrooms. This is huge plus for us with anywhere we go to eat
3. The beer menu - If you know your beers you are gonna salivate. Mikkellar, Evil Twin, Urban Family and Jolly Pumpkin are staples and always rotating, not to mention unique limited one offs that make guest appearances. The beer menu is half the reason we go.
4. The Patio - In my opinion its the best in Summerlin. Its airy and open and amazing on a day with good weather, and YES they do have heaters for night.

CONS:
1. My only con is the wine prices. I'm not a big wine drinker but when we bring friends they always gripe about the prices of the wine and I tend to agree. I've never asked about a corking fee but if you're a wino it might be worth calling and asking about ahead of time. 

RECS:
1. The octopus is cooked the way it should be - TRY IT, even if you dont like octopus they do it amazingly well
2. Prosciutto Pizza - Its amazing, just do it.
3. Beet Salad. I have hated beets ever since my mom forced me to eat them as a kid. However, due to this salad I have rekindled a broken relationship with an overlooked root vegetable.
4. Affotago for dessert - If you like coffee you are gonna thank me for this one.
4. Did I mention the beer?

We arrived late, around 9:40pm (they close at 10pm) but the host and sole waiter were as sweet as ever. I did not feel rushed in the slightest, but did try to be conscientious because I can only imagine how annoying it is to wait around on people when all you want to do is go home after a long day.

Our order:

-Beet salad
-Buffala mozzerella with roasted tomatoes
-Due Forni Neopolitan crust pizza
-Speck Roman crust pizza

Yum! Everything was very tasty. My favorite was the buffala mozz with roasted tomatoes. The mozz was creamy and beautiful, so good.

The beet salad and pizzas were all very good, but my only complaint was that the speck pizza was a bit soggy in the center. Perhaps it wasn't cooked all the way through? When I picked up a slice from the pizza plate to move it to my single serving plate the crust didn't hold up, it started to slip downward and the toppings began their slow slide down until I rushed the slice over to my plate. However, the taste was fresh and I really did enjoy the meal.

I came here on a Saturday night with some friends. Molly was kind enough to make reservations for us because some reviews mention that it was an absolute must. That was not the case. The restaurant was about 3/4 empty. 

It is a very elegant restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. They were patient with us while we waited for out fourth person to arrive. In the meantime I opted for a Moretti beer, he brought me a Hefeweizen (about $3 more). I can't speculate on whether this was intentional or a simple oversight, but it still annoyed me. We started off with a Capraccio appetizer (thin sliced prime beef, arugula, pine nuts, parmesan, cremini mushrooms, black truffle) - for $11.95 it did nothing for me. It actually was fairly tasteless even though I was hungry.

We then opted to share three pizzas --Due Forni, Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto, and Prosciutto E Rucola. That was roughly $50 worth of pizza alone. Had it been as amazing as people rave it to be I would not have minded this price tag, but it was not. The neapolitan crust was still too thin and hard without too much flavor. Everyone had piles of crust left on their plates and that says a lot. When Molly and I go to Settebello for our neapolitan pizza fix, you can bet your life there will not be a drop of that pizza left. 

For the price, this place just isn't worth it. The service was fine, the food was adequate but overpriced, and I would not go out of my way to dine here again.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,13,2,3,edC1Dvxnd9WhH6WLB_mXvg

I noticed people from my neighborhood here and a couple neighbors posting pics here, and due to it's location I can see you might only know about this if you do live local. The decor makes it look like a trendy restaurant and I love the lights, very cool. Upon entering we were warmly greeted which was appreciated, and once I sat down I was given the menu and someone brought waters.  My husband arrived and sat at the table and the second he arrived the waiter asked if we were ready to order. My husband did not even look at the menu yet. When I said we need a moment, instead what we got was no attention at all, and we had to flag down another waitress to help us because our waiter was too busy. There were 2 waiters for about 10 tables full of people and they did not seem to be able to handle it. 

On to the food, we ordered the beet salad (great taste but not enough arugula. Its nice to have a bite of arugula with every bite of beet, but if you do that then you have about half a plate of beets left with no arugula. The Tartufo pizza was excellent (but pricey $20.95). Our meal was big enough to share if you are not that hungry. 

The service was lacking here, we had to flag down the waiter for our bill, water, to ask for more arugula, and they did not come and ask how the food was once. Considering others mentioned how great the service was, maybe this was an off night.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,0,0,3,jFvDkLMF6M6XLOpvYmmnBw

Pepperoni Pizza, soft crust: made with quality ingredients and everything    you would expect.
Brasato Pizza, thin crust: might not be something you would think to order, but you should.

Our server upsold us on the sweet bufala riccota dessert (with honey and pistachios) in turn we ordered americanos. See what I am saying? All around smooth and pleasant dining experience.

1865260,2014-05-07,1,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Four or possibly four and  a half stars for the pizza quality, which is what you come here for anyway. Went in today at 5:30PM and dined on the patio- it was a gorgeous and breezy day, perfect for alfresco wine and pizza with my guy before he went off for the night shift.

Had difficulty selecting a wine, server suggested a flight with three of their reserved wines in smaller pours. Sounded good, so we went for it and really enjoyed the presentation with the printed descriptions of each glass as a placemat. 
First wine was light and to my liking, second was my guy's favorite- fuller bodied and reminiscent of a cab, but the third was overwhelmingly acidic and we did not drink it.

Ordered the Miala Bolognese pizza, romana style, at our server's suggestion (pork ragu, san marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, basil, caramelized onion, clabrian pepper)- very hearty with just a bit of spice, amazing cheese. Roman style crust was thin, crispy, and crackly, but still firm. The combination of tomatoes and cheese and crust was spectacular- made me very curious to try the margherita.
Unfortunately the pork was on the dry side, but it was still surprisingly flavorful and did not detract from the other elements of the dish- kind of an impressive feat. Pork itself was also notably not fatty, getting it's flavor from quality.

Then we got the bill- just under $20 for an artisan-style pizza with high quality toppings, not bad. But the wine flight, not listed on the menu or mentioned in price by the server who suggested it, was a surprisingly high $36, for 9 oz- only 6 of which we even drank. Had I known the flight was equivalent to three entire glasses of wine, I would have chosen from the menu and had one large glass of a wine I DID like rather than merely sips, and leaving an entire glass behind unfinished.

It wasn't until I pulled up the business page on Yelp that I noticed we were there smack-dab in the middle of happy hour- from 4:30 to 6:30, FYI, and yet no one we interacted with, from the bartender, to the host, to the server, ever bothered to mention it or drop off a menu of their featured specials.
Not sure what is to blame for this oversight- would have much rather had the goat cheese appetizer and a single glass of wine with my pizza, had I known about the HH specials or the actual price of my wine flight. This should be mentioned when suggesting it to other diners in the future.

TL;DR: Pizza is sublime and delicious, star subtracted for lack of transparency with pricing of wine flight suggested by server.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,2,3,JvER4ICVMDvXcPpPKPpu7A

The menu isn't huge but it's definitely well-rounded and offers a lot of unusual, interesting choices.  Here's what we tried:

Spinach salad ($8.95) -- this was the perfect size for 2 people to share.  The spinach greens were fresh and came loaded with great toppings like walnuts, orange segments, garbanzo beans and salty slices of ricotta salata cheese-- an interesting and delicious combo of flavors :)

Due Forni pizza ($15.95) -- SUPER good!! You have a choice of pizza crust style and we chose the Neapolitan, which is thin and chewy.  The crust actually reminded me of pizza I had in Italy, which is very hard to find! The toppings were fabulous too -- homemade sausage, fresh mozzarella, bacon and roasted red peppers.  FYI, the pizza was only 12-14"" in diameter so if you're super hungry, you should probably order your own pizza.  

Ricotta drizzled w/ Honey & Toasted Pistacios ($6.95) -- this dessert was creamy and delicious and felt decadent without being too heavy.  The ricotta was incredibly smooth, not-too-sweet and when combined with the honey and pistacios...WOW!! 

Overall I was really impressed with this place -- the food was wonderful and uses high-quality ingredients that make the dishes special & memorable.  Service was great throughout; our server was very knowledgeable, polite and attentive.

1939640,2012-09-25,9,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Scratch one off the personal bookmarks. 

Been meaning to hit up Due Forni for quite some time. Heard about it from my yelp social group who had nothing but good things to say about the place. Highlights seems to focus more on the braised octopus dish that's so tender it's not like any octopus you've ever had. Well...i've had a lot of octopus and i do enjoy octopus...CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!!

 - Polipo 
The revered octopus appetizer...The description on the menu honestly does not do this dish ANY justice. How much does the menu description downplay the epicness of this dish? Well it's kinda like calling a nuke a typical explosive...it goes boom things get fucked up u know how it goes...

Whoa where do i start...Okay first impression was the smell that hit me. I was confused at first because it sorta had a fish sauce smell and i was raised around fish sauce. Seeing the greens in the bowl and the smell of fish sauce my mind already determined what this was going to taste like. Not saying this is a bad thing it's just from my prospective my mind was playing tricks on me based on what the senses were collecting. Imagine seeing the lid pulled from a plate of steamed veggies and you smelled steak...kinda like that...confusing

Anyway first bite of a piece of octopus it was just...WOW it's tender. Not too salty and was well balanced with the dressing of the small salad. I gotta be careful with this dish in the future because it may just raise the standard for my future octopus experiences.

 - Speck Pizza in a Neapolitan 
Very nice and well balanced. Only thing i hated about it was the difficult of getting enough prosciutto with every bite. Not exactly a pizza friendly ingredient but...what ever..file it under First World Problems. Very balanced and i enjoyed the layers of flavors from the order of toppings, to cheese, to dough. 

Noticed half a slice in that there was no sauce. My first reaction to this was 'well...why not?' then i started to realize that adding a sauce would have added another layer of flavor and it was just perfect without it. 

Apart from the cheese, i was thoroughly impressed with the crust and dough in general. Granted it's not as crispy as i'd like it but it did have a fresh taste to it as well as a decent chewy texture. There was no discarded crusts at this table we ate it all.

Overall the ingredients are just top-notch. I dont know exactly where their cheese comes from but i'd love to brush my teeth with it.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,9,7,5,u4DfDVfy_5mVij4AqKm7uw

The table shared the Bucatini as well, but I can see myself ordering it for myself on my next visit; it was delicious!
We ended up doing dessert here too, as there was French Toast Bread Pudding (which is, imo, one of the most beautiful string of words in the English language). Served in a still-hot skillet alongside coffee, it was the perfect way to round out a successful first visit.

Polipo - braised octopus over greens; nicely cooked and tasty, the octopus was neither too firm nor too chewy

Polpette - turkey meatballs; not as flavorful as we had expected, but decent

Caesar Salad - decent, but nothing particularly special

For entrees, we ordered 3 pizzas, Neapolitan style:
Due Forni - our favorite of our pizzas, tasty and delicious, with perfectly crispy, chewy crust

Tartufo - some found it a bit too ""eggy"", but if you enjoy the flavor of black truffle and egg, it's delicious

Margherita - this pizza classic was very nicely cooked and enjoyable, although for one person all the cheese slid right off his slice

For dessert, we ordered:
Chocolate Panna Cotta - very rich, very chocolatey, very delicious

Ricotta with Honey and Pistachios - a mix of savory and not-too-sweet; not for everyone, but tasty

Deducting one half star for the prices:  A typical casual meal includes 1x app, 1x pizza, 4x glasses of wine and 1x desert + tip and puts us at $100 to $120 bucks every time.  Overall everything is just overpriced.  I feel like I should be getting a more upscale experience for this level of spend.

Deducting one half star for the consistent short pours on wine.  I've been here 3 or 4 times and seeing a place branding itself as a wine bar but serving small pours is just a bummer; especially @ an average of $15 per glass.  Nora's and Vintner bar does better here for you winos out there.

Overall the place has a great vibe and superb food so it's hard not to go back (and we will).  If it were just a little more reasonable we'd dine here more often.",3nVaTBpC-Rz0KIBreSN-CQ,0,0,4,uuFfSGJJlZRdsOGVUJ6bDg

Anyway, we came here during lunch and it wasn't super busy with a private party or anything, but we had to wave down the waiter for our waters to be refilled and for the check.
The food was very good. I ordered my usual Mozzarella Bar choices, soft and creamy mozzarella and prosciutto with the soft and warm bread and it was more filling than you'd think.
I had the spinach and pecan salad and that was so so, as it wasn't as tasty as I'd thought it would be.
My daughter ordered the white pizza on the soft and crusty bread and that was fresh and piping hot with a bit of tang from the soft cheeses and salt from the mozzarella.

2206250,2011-08-29,3,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"The Skinny: Some delicious dishes like their lusciously umami semolina gnocchi, or the subtle smoky tang of their Pizza Bianca were undermined by other dishes (3.5), Service/Ambience: uncomfortable wooden chairs, some small service issues although the server/hostess are friendly (3), others like the decor, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly come to play at this pizza joint (3.5).

I'm conflicted about Duo Forni. After visiting this establishment 2 times (my hubby 3 times), there appeared to be significant difference between the two visits.

The dark decor has its charms. Large plasma screens replay The Good, The Bad and The Ugly on a continuous loop. The spartan decorative lightbulbs hang from the ceiling while two large pizza ovens dominate the open kitchen area. FYI - the wooden chairs are not kind to the tush. 

A couple of weeks ago, we came for dinner with a friend and indulged in a great meal. We had their spinach salad, semolina gnocchi, Pizza Bianca and Duo Forni pizza. Several weeks later, we came into try their seasonal specials of foie gras pizza and sausage rapini combination which were not nearly the same quality as the first visit.

Of note, the hubby preferred the Roman crust which is cooked at a higher temperature but for a shorter period of time. I have to admit, I'm conflicted about describing the crust. The first time, it was great - light, crispy yet with a little bit of chewiness to provide some substance (in a good way). Second visit, the crust was significantly denser and not nearly as delightful.

Same experience with the spinach salad. First experience - wonderful sweet, savory flavours melding together. The addition of chickpeas, orange segments and nuts made it a complete dish. It was well dressed and seasoned. Second time round - although there was more spinach and condiments compared to the first time, the salad lacked flavour while the orange tasted a little odd.

The semolina gnocchi here is more pasta-like than your typical potato dumpling gnocchi. However, the accompanying sauce was rich and umami-ish. The smokiness of bacon paired with the sweetness of peas was a great combination. The bit of truffle was the icing on the cake.

Pizza Bianca had a great flavour profile - acidity of balsamic, sweet caramelized onion, salty prosciutto. Again, that first visit, the crust was superb. The Duo Forni pizza was just okay for me - I found their sausage to be a little too mild for my tastes and I wished there was a little more basil.

Flash forward a few weeks and a more disappointing experience.

Hudson foie gras mousse, peaches, caramelized onion was not such a great combination. There wasn't enough foie gras in the mousse to taste the goose liver while its beautiful luxurious texture became grainy/soupy on the pizza. It may have been preferable to serve the foie seared and on the side/on top. The addition of all the moist ingredients made for a more soggy crust.

The rapini/sausage/pine nut pizza fared a little bit better with the crust however was lacking in flavour. Although we did substitute the blue cheese for fontina, the dish definitely needed some salt. The sausage was too mild for our tastes while the pine nuts left a burnt, bitter taste due to the high heat in the oven.

In addition, we had a couple of small quibbles about the service. 1) Our table on the second visit was dusty and had crumbs on it (we could see the outlines of where the placemats were removed), 2) an empty plate was given to us with a hair on it (although it was quickly replaced when pointed out), 3) we had to put our leftovers in a box ourselves (you would expect an upscale casual place to at least box up your leftovers... I hate to mention competitors but Grimaldi's (similarly priced pizza joint) does it.). As I said, really minor stuff because overall the staff is great and they try hard to please.

Overall, considering both visits, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars review. For the price, the food is probably a little expensive given the quantity. One would expect a $16 pizza or a $10 salad to be a wee bit bigger and to have more toppings. Regardless, it's a great addition to Summerlin area.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,6,4,3,5M_vHkTLUtv5edxxqZwdCg
2223155,2014-03-16,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I was exceedingly pleased by our dining experience at Due Forni. Both doors were opened for a grand entrance. We requested to be seated on the outdoor patio. We were instantly greeted by Katherine, who introduced herself as our server for the evening. She gave a brief description of the night's specials. The diver scallops and oxtail special was quite tempting, but we had a tsste for napolean style pizza. We started with the Panzanella salad, which was served swiftly. The description didn't excite, but boy was I impressed and wanting for more. We tried the Maiale Bolognese at Katherine's recommendation. The pizza was made to perfection and the pork was so tender, it melted in my mouth. I kept noticing a wooden board being served to several tables with bread that looked delicious. Katherine told us that it was part of the mozzarella bar. A definite must try next visit. We finished the night with the Sweet Ricotta. Again, something I would not normally order, but bf was taking charge of the ordering tonight. The desert was delightful. It looked like ice cream, but it was not as cold. The honey added a perfect sweetness and paired well with the salty pistachios. The service was A1 from start to finish. Even on our way out, staff held the door for us and wished us well.

From skewered dates to gnocchi to the pizza (prosciutto e rucola; Due Forni namesake pizza), I can't select a favourite item.  I've only had the Neapolitan crust and will try the Roman crust next time.  (The former is baked for 90 seconds at 900 degrees, resulting in a light, chewy crust.  Roman crusts are baked at 500 degrees for 3 minutes, resulting in a thin, firm crust.)

2261663,2011-03-12,2,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Really cute restaurant on Town Center near the 215.  Nice décor.  Our server was really enthusiastic and, at one point, did an ode to sea salt that I cannot do justice.  

We had the tricolore salad ($9.95) which was very light and refreshing.  I believe they added some pears to the salad, which was nice.  We also tried the mozzarella bar ($10.95) where you pick one mozzarella and one side.  They have three different kinds and we went with the classica and the anchovies as our side.  Don't get the anchovies unless you are serious about anchovies.

The great thing about this place is they have two different types of pizza, which is rare for gourmet pizza restaurants.  They have pizza ovens for both Roma and Neapolitan.  Figure out which one you like before you go.  Roma is thinner crust, kind of like Grimaldi's but not as greasy.  Neapolitan is thicker crust, like Settebello.  We prefer Grimaldi's so we went with the Roma Due Forni pizza ($15.95) and it was really, really good!  It comes with tomato, mozzarella, sausage, bacon, and pequillo peppers, which are roasted red peppers.  The mozzarella had a good, slightly smoky flavor and the bacon and sausage were delicious.

They offer Moretti on tap ($5.95/glass) and have a good variety of bottled beers.  They also offer all wines by the glass and have an enomatic machine behind the bar.  Our red wine was served warm so I think the enomatic machines are reserved for the more expensive wines.  Some of their wines cost $50 a glass.  We had the Educated Guess Cabernet ($13.95/glass) and the Suri Barbera ($11.95).  Very good wines but I just wish they were served at the right temperature - slightly cool.

The dessert menu is pretty cool (see pic) and they have a chocolate pizza that I would like to try.  We had the tiramisu gelato and it was very delicious.

They are open until 11pm on the weekends, which is pretty late for Summerlin.  We usually don't make it out until 9pm to eat so it's nice to eat somewhere that isn't trying to close while we are eating.

I'm so happy this place opened in Summerlin and I can't wait to come back!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,8,9,4,_kanaxbtwVlIkIbUF2sffQ
2261991,2012-09-10,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"There's an uneasy feeling about this review, I don't know why...  Maybe a guilty conscience for betraying our all time favorite Settebello?  I mean, Settebello has everything; great location, supreme Pizza and great service, our loyalty runs deep and strong.

However, the need for exploration trumps loyalty (and we really wanted to see how good the Pizza really is).  We started convincing ourselves that since it was Summerlin, it wasn't cheating, we had to go since we were 'Food Bloggers', we needed to branch out and explore possibilities, we can't be tied downright now, no it's not you..it's me.... really... Sheepishly and incognito, we snuck over to the other side of town to scope out the competition.

And we were ready to hate this place, how dare they even try to make pizzas in this town when there's Settebello's? We turned the corner and found a full parking lot, a good sign.  The facade was your usual non-descript Vegas dessert beige with little adornment except for the signage.  An enlarged, covered seating area laid empty, due to the hot summer heat.  I was already committing myself to be unimpressed..

As it turned out, the inside revealed a beautiful restaurant; the design modern minimal, stylish with all the current fixtures du jour, but still casual enough to feel comfortable...I was really impressed with the entry service; the Maitre'D was impeccable, congenial and polite and really set the experience on a very high note (remembering my name and repeating throughout the meal)

The restaurant is divided into two sections and area with a Bar designated for Adults, and a main Dining Room area that includes families.  I thought that was a nice touch and very in tune with their customer demographic.  I was really starting to enjoy this place!!! 

As for cocktails, a light summer drink on the menu that had caught our eye was the Hummingbird: 
St.Germain Elderflower liqueur + Prosecco + Club Soda.  The floral fragrance of Elderflower quenched our thirst, while the dry, bubbly counterpart left a refreshing finish!  

What Due Forni had that differentiated themselves from other Pizzerias was their Mozarella Bar: with several choices of cheese and add ons like Roasted Tomatoes and Basil Pesto, it was hard not to fall in love...

We ordered the Classic Mozarella + Taggiasca Olives + Roasted Red Peppers with oven fresh Bread.  Man, was the Bread good!!! The soft creamy texture of Mozarella alone is orgasmic, but spreading the liquid cheese all over Bread makes it close to Nirvana (the place, not the band....that wouldn't particularly pleasant)... Oh, and the sides are a nice touch.

The Pizza selection at Due Forni, compressed and distinguished to a T, you had two style choices for each Pizza: Pizza Napoletana, a traditional crust bread with a chewy bite, and Pizza Romana, a thinner wafer like crispy cracker, each pizza cooked in a different oven (thus the name: Due Forni - two ovens).

And as the main event approached, the anticipation was palpable!  my palms started to sweat, could this be better than I expected? We were advised to order the signature Due Forni: San Marzano Tomatoes+Bufala Mozzarella+House Made Sausage+Nueske's Bacon+Pequillo Peppers, our helpful server gently pointed us out to choose the Neopolitan style with this order.  On a side note, some of the Pizzas are white (no Tomatoes) so be sure to ask before ordering so that you're not surprised when it comes out different than you expected.

And when the Pizza came out, it was beautiful!  The proportions of toppings with the bubbly bread was visually magnificent.  And with our first bite, immediately the Home made Sausage stole the show!  I could have just that forever.  The Pizza itself, well it was different than Settebello's, the chewy crust was  for sure softer and fluffy, it all comes down to personal taste at this point, because I thought the Pizza was pretty fabulous!!! 

We had a great dining experience at Due Forni, the service was excellent; our serve was ever so elegant and thoughtful from start to finish, we couldn't have imagined that they would exceed their expectations...  By all definitions, Due Forni has won us over, we loved the drinks and appetizers, would love to try more that they have to offer, and also try a Pizza Romana in a different style. In the end, we will always have our favorite, but now we have another reason to hop on over to the other side for a great time!!

2288599,2011-09-23,1,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I must admit I'm thoroughly impressed. I need to put Due Forni in the same sentence as ""Napoletana Pizza"" so if others searching for a great neopolitan pizza in the Summerlin area, as I have been for the past few years, do an Internet search, Due Forni shows up.

For years, Papa Lou and I have been trekking to Settebello for our fave pizza, but I think Due Forni will satisfy my love for Napoletana pizza just fine. The crust was perfectly charred, soft and chewy. My husband ordered the Due Forni pizza on the Roman crust, and although the toppings were plentiful, they were not overwhelming at all; in fact, the sausage was delicious. The crust was light and crisp, but I much prefer the pizza I ordered with the Napoletana crust. I prefer not to muck my pizza up with toppings and go for the Margherita....and the fresh ingredients did not disappoint. 

We completely indulged and ordered the tiramisu gelato and sweet bufala ricotta with pistachios and honey -- OMG - it was un-freakin-believable! The ricotta was so creamy and delectable I would return just for that and that alone!

Undoubtedly Due Forni is a place I will return to soon!",-HAHTQeOzHX5TCDb7qs9Yw,3,1,4,AbLEPi3y5udtDqDbIyZaIg

2367798,2012-03-06,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"It gives me no joy to write this.  I wanted to like this restaurant, but I gave it two visits and left unhappy both times.  The ingredients are fresh and the decor nice, but the service is bad and the food is disappointing.  The ingredients are fresh and high-quality, but the preparation seems lacking.

Food:  Last time, we had the soft mozzarella board, which was decent.  Not amazing, but not bad.  My girlfriend had Polipo (octopus) which she said was fantastic.  Not chewy at all, and very tasty.  We shared a Tartufo pizza (mushroom and truffle), which I cannot recommend.  The truffles and mushrooms were overwhelming.  Too much of a good thing is not good.  This preparation has a raw egg over the top, which is supposed to get cooked by the heat of the fresh pizza.  Ours ended up runny and raw.    

Tonight, we had D's Bees and the Boston for cocktails.  There were 6 specialty cocktails and we had two, but they tasted suspiciously similar.  Neither were good and we left them both untouched.  Management took one off the bill, which was very nice.  For our meal, we had beef carpaccio (which is a unique preparation of the dish), which my girlfriend thought was light and ""interesting"", but entirely forgettable.  We ordered a Margherita pizza, again with great ingredients and cooked well...but bland.  The branzino is one of the best pieces of fish I have had, but after eating it, I was hungry.  The Manager recommended desserts, chocolate gelato w/ bacon on top and ricotta gelato with pistaccios on top.  The ricotta was bland and decidedly ""not worth the calories"".  The chocolate gelato was good, but nothing special.  

The General Manager was so enthusiastic and friendly, that he got in the way of our server, who was already undertrained and left alone to flounder.  He was so busy ""bullshitting"" that he failed to notice that he was talking to unhappy customers.  It was a classic example of thinking about what you are saying, rather than observing or listening.  And this was after he noticed we did not like our drinks.  When we talked about the drinks, instead of apologizing and moving on, he defended the cocktails and made as if we were at fault.  He did, on a positive note, bring over a type of gin that he thought we should sample.  It was interesting, but had little to do with our meal.  Honestly, this place is so close to what I want a restaurant to be, that it hurts.  By being so close, this failure of a restaurant becomes more frustrating.

The pizza, the pizza is SO GOOD! And my absolute favorite was the Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto - they just pile on the ham like it's going out of style, a way a pizza should be made. And I definitely can't complain about the others, they were also good, just didn't make the top favorite. I will say that they do have a gluten free crust, but I didn't have a chance to try it. 
We also had an assortment of the mozzarella bar: you can't go wrong with this. They offer three types of mozzarella and 6 complimentary sides. The Gnocchi - never had such small pieces of gnocchi - cute and delicious!!! 
For dessert, they served chocolate gelato with bacon and I have to say I love both those things, just not together. And then there was this delicious chocolate, nutella pizza dessert thingy that was to die for. It totally made up for the bacon chocolate gelato for me. 

Other things to note:
- the pizza place is super cute and has a very rustic chic feel to it. 
- What I didn't get to try when I was here was any of the wine. They have quite the selection, and for this wino alone, I'll be going back. (as well as ordering a Bianca Al Proscuitto Cotto pizza)

I don't like olives, but they really worked with the octopus well. The beet salad at other restaurants are usually arugula salads with 4 or 5 pieces of beets. This salad had a heaping amount of beets on it and was so good! The pesto and goat cheese worked very well with it. We got the Due Forni pizza which was delicious as always and also the Maiale. THAT was amazing. It had pork ragu on it and had a bit of a spice kick, which I loved. So flavorful and delicious. 

I knocked off one star for the service. The manager who walked us to our table was very pleasant. Our server was Sergio, and while he was decent, it seemed like we were a bit of a bother to him. It took a while to get our drinks and check, and I never received the Coke I ordered. Also, in the middle of eating our meatballs, he said, ""would you like some of our house made bread to go with that?"" We said yes. We get the check and see that we were charged for it. I'm sorry, but if you're charging for the bread that you OFFERED us, shouldn't you tell us that we're paying for it instead of us just finding it on the check? Don't get me wrong, it was good bread and I don't mind paying it, but it's the principle. Don't offer something unless you let them know it's not complimentary. It was bread, not an actual dish.

We were looking for quiet conversation over wine and light fare, and Due Forni delivered on both.  Since we weren't really familiar with many of the wine labels they carried, we took a ""risk"" on a new-to-us Pinot Noir from CA and a recommended Rose -- both were lovely.

We started with the STRACCIATELLA, an artisan platter of creamy cheese, housemade pesto, warm bread, and olives -- incredibly delicious and a generous portion.  We followed that with two of the salads: the ARUGULA with pistachios, tomatoes, and white balsamic dressing, and the MIX GREENS with brie, figs, pecans and a white balsamic dressing.

2593078,2012-01-13,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"As far as pizza places in Las Vegas go... I think we can all agree that they are lacking in general.  This restaurant is no different.  The pizza is...OK.  The big claim here is that there are two types of crusts available (although only one size).  Neither is winning any ribbons of excellence, but the choice is nice.  Also, there is a distinct lack of toppings.  Not the choice of toppings, but what arrives on the pizza, especially the sauce.  Sadly, they have confused rustic with sparse.  They seem to be aiming slightly for gourmet but were highly inconsistent among those that arrived at our table.

The second time I ate there (both were with groupons) I had a steak-dominated salad.  It was very good but really could have used more of the actual salad portion.  But this place isn't really bragging about anything but the pizza....  It doesn't make sense when it seems the other dishes are where the effort lies.

It is nice that you can choose to eat inside or on their enclosed patio.  This gives them big points in my book.  The first time we ate outside and had one server (lunch) and it was great.  The waitress was great.  The second time we went in and ate inside and had three different servers hovering over us (lunch).  It was overkill and kind of creepy toward the end.  It was odd, but perhaps just a consequence of over-staffing at lunch.

Lastly, the decor here is far nicer than the strip mall outer shell lends to.  The spacious bar is very well done and I hope to visit for dinner.  I just won't be ordering the pizza.",Wa_dytXjCuUri4CJsKSd3w,1,0,3,gQv6faByGCVzveAz0QhS6g

The prosciutto and arugula pizza would appeal to individuals like my husband who like sweet finishes to savory dishes.  The meat pizza on the other hand... I kept thinking what is wrong with this joint? My pizza is soggy!  But then I came across an article on Serious Eats about a recent trip to Italy.  

Apparently, Neapolitan pizzas are really meant to be eaten wet.  Yes, WET. There are 2 types of crusts served here in Due Forni - Roman and Neapolitan.  We ordered the prosciutto one in Roman crust, and the meat pizza in Neapolitan crust.  The tomato sauce in the latter order really consumes the thin crust of the Neapolitan pizza, thus making it wet and soggy.  Maybe I need to be serenaded by the Italian coast and culture before I really get into this stuff.  In the meantime, I'll stick to my dry pizza or the other items on the Due Forni menu.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,1,2,4,wNNtqzJvDAc9GG68l-EKrw

The waiter was a patient kind person, we had about 12 people that couldn't make up their mind on drinks and asked the same questions over and over again and he answered the questions over and over again.  

We ordered some appetizers since it was happy hour and they were all good. Some of my colleagues ordered the pizza and it was crispy, thin and full of flavor.

Here are the dishes I tried:

Mozzarella Bar with sliced prosciutto, artichoke hearts, creamy mozzarella with their soft chewy bread.  It was really good.  However, since I was sharing the dish, the prosciutto was hard to pull apart, it looked like it was just one big slice of cured meat.  However it was really good.

Polipo (octopus) salad, the octopus was tender and moist.  I would have been happy to have this as my main dish.  One of my co-workers said that if she knew it was octopus, she wouldn't have tried it.  So since she didn't know she said it tasted like perfectly cooked chicken. 

Piccante (sopressata) pizza it was completely filled with lots of thinly sliced sopressata (salami) so it was a little too salty for me.  Even though it had some thinly sliced bell peppers, it still did not kill the saltiness.  So once slice was enough for my blood pressure. 

Polpette (meatballs) appetizer.  It was flavorful and tasty, a definite must try with their delicious well seasoned marinara sauce. 

Margherita pizza was good.  Nothing special that you can't get at another New York style pizza place.  I rather use the $$ for another order of the Polpette (unless you are a vegetarian).

Tartufo pizza was very interesting.  It had mushrooms and egg.  All I can say is that it was interesting.  If I had to get this as my entrée, I would have regretted it.

3031911,2015-07-20,5,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"We popped in for dinner one night after the gym. It's located in south Summerlin off of town center, across from the gardens park. The restaurant itself has a great feel. It's pretty casual and comfortable. The music... Well that needs some help... Really weird melodies playing on a Monday night:/ 

We were greeted at the door by a very friendly and well dressed older man. I'm assuming he is the manager. He held the door and sat us promptly. We opted for patio seating and I was so glad we did! The patio is covered with fans to help keep it cool. The seating was comfortable and the tables were sturdy. 

Our server was nice. He told us about the menu and went over the beers and wines. I ordered a red blend, nothing fancy... Still tasty though. My boyfriend and I opted to split the beet salad (made vegan) and the veggie gluten free pizza (also prepared vegan). I'm not one to complain... But... $4.95 extra to prepare a small 8inch pizza gluten free is just a tad bit pushing my limits. Our pizza was around 23.00 dollars after tax. It was pretty delicious though. I would order it again... When I want to splurge on pizza. The veggies were fresh And the dough was not overly spongey or crisp. We did mention sharing the beet salad... And they split it for is on two plates (nice gesture) ;) It was really good. One of my favorite beet salads thus far... The pistachios added a great crunch. Our friend ordered a chicken Caesar salad. It was a pretty standard portion... Not very difficult to mess up... He said it was good. 

The server gave us our bill without an itemized (something I really despise). I like to look over everything on the tab. I can not tell you how many times I've been over charged, under charged, didn't receive add Ins I was charged for, and auto grated on tabs I would of really just never questioned without the itemized. If I could knock half of a star for this... I would. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely be back.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,8,7,4,k_6SN3yLQ5fGmidv0WL0tw

We happened upon this establishment quite by accident. Turns out, its absolutely the best pizza restaurant I have been to in this city. Service is excellent but not too formal, pizza is traditional and simplistic, the appetizers and dessert you should make a separate trip for. 

The wine selection is limited to a few dozen nice varietals, one section in the $50ish per bottle range, and the other in the $100ish. Again very simple and saves you from having to browse through pages and pages of hundreds of different prices and types.

They appear to have two large, real pizza ovens which you can see through the glass partition. We had a simple Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto which was fantastic, a bowl of decadent Gnocchi  and the Chef's platter. Nothing fancy; simple, perfect, delicious.

We plan on stopping by happy hour and just trying the mozzarella bar. Will report back with more

3066019,2013-05-16,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"The service here was fantastic!  In town for work, I came in for a relaxing weeknight dinner.  Everyone was on it -  the extra friendly host, my charming waiter and the bartender who went out of his way to wish me a nice night.  They pay attention to details here, even the waiter who was new and shadowing my waiter made sure to turning the label of the water bottle in my direction after pouring.  Its SO nice to be taken care of...

I ordered the roasted beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios on arugula to start and the Neapolitan margherita pizza.  I am a huge fan of beets, so I was thrilled with the generous portion.  The goat cheese was nice quality, too.  The pizza was good and had a nice char from the oven.  My waiter nicely explained to me that this style of pizza is made with dough that has a higher water content, so the middle tends to be wetter.  It wasn't the best Neapolitan pizza I've ever had but it was tasty.  And is pizza ever really bad?  

Food was 4 stars.  Service was 5+.  I've had much more expensive dinners in this city that weren't half as good.  The wine list looked nice.  I didn't partake but a table a few down from mine seemed to be having a great time enjoying some nice bottles of red.  

I liked the outdoor patio (it was cool enough to sit outsice) but the bar was packed, too.  It looked like there were some good spots to have a beer, get dinner and watch a game.",c26yrPWMX8KIkcDp2gdqrQ,2,2,5,j0TFXQTx5_TVPX43vX7qgQ

3092540,2012-02-13,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"So my wife has recently had her Jones on for a return trip to Due Forni and I felt this past weekend was the time to make it happen. We had made our first trip to Due Forni in September of last year based on a tip we had received during a doctor appointment and fell in love with the place immediately. Unfortunately, we hadn't made it back until this last Friday evening and the experience was even better than the first time.

  We were met at the door by the same guy that seated us on our first trip in and I turned to my wife and said, ""This is one of the guys we were talking the last time we were here"".  He overheard me and replied that he remembered us. At this point I was ready to throw the bullsh$t flag until he said to me, ""You were wearing a Grimaldi's Pizzeria shirt the last time you were here"". Wow!! Then he proceeded to tell us where we sat (at the bar) and recited part of our order! Are you kidding??!! Anyone that is that is that committed to knowing their customers has my business for sure. This gentleman, Alex, then took us to our table in the outdoor seating area. 

  Our server came over and took our appetizer order; the Mozzarella Bar with stracciatella style mozzarella and basil pesto. The creamy cheese was the perfect complement to the pesto and pizza crust that is part of this wonderful plate. This was truly a great start to an excellent meal. We also ordered the wine flights which came with a half glasses (about 4 0z.) of each Dolcetto, Barbera and Nebbiolo. The girls loved the Dolcetto and quite frankly I was a fan of all three. I will warn you that the Nebbiolo is a very full bodied, oaky wine. If you're a pinot or lighter zin drinker the Nebbiolo may put you in a head lock. You've been warned.

  Dinner was what it always is for us at a place like Due Forni; Neapolitan style margherita pizza. Just like our first time at Due Forni we were very pleased with our dinners. The crust had the perfect char that you would expect from a good Neapolitan style pizza, sweet San Marzano pizza sauce and just the right amount of Bufala mozzarella and basil. As we devoured our pies another server named Adam came over to check on us. I recognized him from our first trip as well and asked him if tended bar part of the time. He said he did and he remembered us as well from our previous visit. Again, I was quite impressed that we were remembered.

  We finished dinner with two of the same dessert we had before; chocolate gelato with crispy bacon crumbles and whipped bufala ricotta with toasted pistachios and honey drizzle. And once again, any description I would try to give wouldn't do them justice. The sweet creaminess of the chocolate gelato contrasted by the smoky, savory bacon works perfectly together while the fluffy whipped ricotta and toasted pistachios are a little slice of heaven.

  I know this review is a little long, but I really believe that Due Forni is a must try restaurant for anyone that enjoys great food.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,6,4,5,HE6k0COByY8r2SU1IEj4fg

With two dining areas, a full bar and outdoor seating, Due Forni has locals and those who are in the know coming back for more. The Cannoli was seriously the BEST Cannoli I have ever had. The filling was so soft and creamy and the outside was a perfect crunch. YUM! The wine selection was decent and we noticed lots of different parties coming in; a group of guys watching a game at the bar, a couple sharing pasta over a date night and a small group of family meeting a new boyfriend for the first time. I can see why this place is a favorite for locals. The décor is quaint and cozy. They have wine bottles , soft lighting and art on the walls. The menu is Italian and they offer two types of pizzas, a thicker crust and a flat bread. All the menu items were freshly prepared as we expected. I will come back.

We all wanted water and got terrible service after the waiter found out we weren't buying alcohol.

She had to say ""What?"" to get him to use his words and ask if she needed a box. Then, to top it all off, he brought out an ice cream for the birthday girl without asking and then charged us $3 for it. Food was decent, not the best pizza I've ever had.

The pizza was very good with real tomato sauce, fresh Mozzarella cheese (sliced, not shredded) and basil leaves on top.
That was a small sized pizza for what we usually get from other pizza places and I paid $14.00. Some might think it's a bit pricey for a thin simple pizza and might still starve after they eat it.

My entire meal was unexpectedly great. From the service, to the outdoor patio area, to the great beer menu, to the great tasting food. I can here wanting a solid artisanal pie in town for a reasonable price and my expectations were pretty mild. I hadn't heard much about Due Forni so I came in blank, but I was impressed I have to say. 

They have about 8 different pizza options, about half being vegetarian, with either Roman or Neapolitan crust. They have about 4 salads, 5 appetizers, and a few other main dishes as well. Then they have a mozzarella platter for a starter. So pretty limited menu overall but all very good. We had the mozzarella with a few sides and a spinach pizza. Then we had about 4 drinks total. The wine list is nice and reasonably priced. The beer list is actually very good and there's some rare beers on the list from Chicago and the east coast that you definitely won't find around town. In the high end for beer prices but that's what you get in Summerlin and rare imports.

The beer and wine selection was great and the servers were all nice.  We started with the panzanella.  Honestly, not really a panzanella.  It's a salad with a lot of croutons, panzanella is supposed to be dressed so that it starts to soften up a bit.  It was a good salad and we enjoyed it but panzanella it was not.  Then we had the mozerella, straciatelli style.  My favorite part of the meal.  It was like the inside of a buratta mozerella, extremely gooey and delicious.  Plus it comes with basically a fresh baked pizza dough to slather it on.  We got it with the artichokes which were kind of  boring and bland, but I didn't care because the mozerella was so good.

Next we ordered the gnocchi.  It is semolina gnocchi so if you are used to light fluffy gnocchi this is not what you are looking for.  It was tasty, not super interesting, and very heavy.  Next we ordered the Neopolitan style pizza with ham, fontina and carmelized onion.  The flavors were good and the crust was nice but for a relatively small pizza, the crust was rather large with all the toppings gathering in the center.  Made for some tasty first couple of bites and some boring last few bites.  Plus the pizza wasn't very good heated up the next day.  

We had a good meal, it was fun, but the end of the meal we were left with a semi bad taste in our mouth.  The server, a few times through the night tried to sell us some wine and beer that he liked.  I thought he was genuinely impressed with these products and he never really said the exact names of the product so I wasn't sure how much things were going to cost but I didn't imagine that he was selling the most expensive glass of wine to me without explaining that that's what it was.  I didn't say anything but when you think you are drinking about $15 of wine and end up being charged for $40, it's a little unsettling.  I guess I need to remember that not all servers are truly looking out for the best interest of the guest.  (especially since I told him I really didn't want a chardonnay and that's what he insisted on me having.)  Too bad, I don't know if we will plan on going back there, not that the food wasn't good, there are a lot of other places I would rather go.",WEXkES4QG-INtrBMtdFyBQ,2,1,4,PA1-wMRAEfnI9GNter_ZbA

The servers give you the old fashioned respectful treatment, which always feels nice. I came here with my girlfriend during restaurant week for dinner and we enjoyed the nice weather outside.

We ordered the stracciatella and the Insalata. The straciatella was a rather unusual dish I must say. I know that mozzarella and tomato salad is a thing that they do out there in Italy, but the addition of ricotta cheese and the melding of the cheeses into some sort of strange paste was a bit unusual. My insalata kept it simple-- greens and tasty olives with a traditional dressing.

My girlfriend ordered the spring chicken and I went with the rib pizza. The pizza was, if anything, a bit too meaty. Lots of yummy arugula and some mushrooms as well. I think I would have liked some marinara sauce with it to weaken the meaty taste of the ribs, but it still tasted pretty decent the way it was made (and the leftover slice I heated the next day in the oven was actually quite nice). Very filling for a Neapolitan style pizza. The chicken was solid-- tender potatoes, seasoned vegetables, and tender, salty chicken. We gobbled it all up without a problem.

Dessert really impressed me. I had the pistaccio ricotta with honey and my girlfriend had the Bourbon caramel panna cotta. Both are EXCELLENT creations. I think the ricotta is a better choice for the more sophisticated palate-- the ricotta is only lightly sweetened and this is complimented by the saltiness of the pistachio and the drizzled honey to create a most pleasurable display of complimentary tastes on the tongue. The panna cotta is a better choice for one with a stronger sweet tooth. The combination of the gelato and the caramel in each bite creates a most soothing sensation of creaminess to balance the unfathomable sweetness of the caramel. Both desserts were promptly and quickly finished by us, the patrons. 

Pleasing atmosphere, good service, and a decent amount of wine for under $10 make this place a winner and well worth a return visit.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,1,4,Q90Hlr9bio7ZLL3sXGSTFg

Obviously their speciality is pizza and they do it right with either thin crust or the traditional neapolitan crust. The authentic italian ingredients and flavors make for truly delicious pizza among other menu items such as the pollipo(octopus salad) and delicious entrees. They also have specials that you can incorporate into pizza if you please. Throw in quick, attentive, knowledgable servers and reasonable prices for Summerlin and this place is a must. 

I may be biased here but that doesn't make the food any less delectable. Eat it and don't forget to thank the drop dead sexy sous chef!",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,3,3,5,wbXwqqBQK2kH64PMpM05MQ

Not sure what has happened between now and July of this year but we had outstanding service and no flack at all was given because we did not have a reservation.  We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. The wine was delish.  Food was prepared perfectly and arrived in a timely fashion. Our waiter was attentive but never pesty and he had great suggestions all night.  We ate, we drank, we conqured! 

The pizza is not your typical Pappa Johns or Grimaldis, and if you come into this establishment with those expectations then you will be disappointed. This is pizza made the Italian and European way. It's not laden in sauce.  You'll find arugala, sweet red peppers and fresh bufala mozarella cheese as toppings.  It is an absolute crying shame if you don't order wine while dinning, it's a crucial part of the meal. Due Forni is out of the box, gourmet even and sure to please the most sophisticated of palates

Appetizer: 

Polipo...""Braised Octopus and Mint Vinegarette?' I asked hesitantly as I read it off the menu.  But it was sure to be one of my favorite dishes of the night.  I did not taste Mint at all in the dish, which in my opinon saved it! The salty and crispy Spanish Octopus tossed into a lighlty dressed arugala and pepper salad was just brilliant! Please don't leave without trying it.  

We definitely made the mistake of ordering too much food.  You can easily share a pizza and have just enough room for dessert.  But instead we each ordered our own pizza, bottle of wine, appetizer and dessert! Yes, big fatties tonight.

Pizza:

Hubby ordered a Roman style, Due Forni pizza and I ordered the Tartufo pizza Neopolitan style.  The Due Forni pizza had great flavor.  Loved the homemade sausage.  I also loved the little red peppers too.  It's perfect for someone who appreciates a hefty meat lovers pizza. I can't begin to tell you how rich and decadent my Tartufo pizza was!  The rich parmesan crema on top of the fontina cheese mixed with roasted mushroms, black truffles and the baked egg that gets broken on top is beyond incredible. I know it sounds unusual but to say it's delicious is an understatement and the neopolitan crust was soft enough to sop up the yoke just like a good breadstick! 

We rounded out the night with a bottle of Volare(RED) to accompany the food and dessert.  We then finished up the night with the dessert on special.  It was a pancotta with ice cream and cherries with a balsamic drizzle.  We used our groupon and waddled out the door and fell into a lovely food coma on our couch afterwards at home.

+ I loved the Bianca al prosciutto cotto Neapolitan pizza ($14.95). Plenty of cooked ham, fontina, caramelized onions, oregano, aged balsamic on top of of chewy crust with just the right amount of char and crunchiness. 
+ Our kid had a cheese roman pizza and the cracker-like crust was light and crispy.
+ Panzanella salad ($9.95) - arugula, tomato, onion, toasted pistachios, croutons, balsamic vinaigrette. Large enough for two to share. Loved the croutons and pistachios.
+ Beef carpaccio ($11.95) - thin sliced prime beed, arugula, pine nuts, parmesan, black truffle vinaigrette. Six slices of beef rolled up with the other ingredients inside and shaved parmesan on top. Really good flavors. Only negative were the light brown spots on the beef. I didn't get sick, so it's all good.
+ Loved the long list of wines by the glass. They're dispensed from enomatic machines.

+ Covered patio area with heat lamps and windows that they can open or close depending on the weather.

Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The ""Neapolitan"" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the ""Roman"" had a crust that is thin and crispier. 

Since I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the ""Quattro Formaggi"" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni.

Tartufo. My hero. The tartufo pizza is one of the richest pizzas one can have: truffle Parmesan crema pizza with an over easy egg sitting on the top. When it comes out to you have to take the back of a spoon and equally (or not so equally) spread over the rest of the pizza. It's creamy, cheesy, smooth. 

The unsung hero on the menu is the carpaccio, stuffed with arugula and pine nuts, drizzled with a truffle vinaigrette. A must order while you are there. Another great dish was the smoked pork belly, a slice of thick bacon sweet and succulent.

After calling a couple places in the area, Due Forni was the first that said they would be able to accommodate our party with no concerns and no additional wait. One might think that this means business was slow, but far from it - there were plenty of other customers there for Sunday brunch/lunch.

Service was great and attentive; no one seemed to run out of water during our meal. We had plenty of appetizers, all of which arrived at the table piping hot, and everyone was raving about the quality of the bread. For entrees, the majority of our party ordered pizzas (all were pleased with their choices), and some ordered gnocchi (rich, but the menu description makes that clear) and octopus (fantastic).

We had a little mishap during our lunch (a member of our party screamed in fright for reasons completely unrelated to the venue), which I think would have easily warranted some irritation, but the staff was really gracious and checked in on our guest to make sure she was okay.

(octopus appetizer), The Tagliata(skirt steak with spinach, goat cheese, and tomatoes to start, and we split the special pizza of the day, didn't get the name, but it featured Bresola(air dried beef), Cassatica Cheese(a very creamy mozzarella), spinach, evoo, and onions.(Neapolitan Style)

The Polipo was very soft and tasty and the tomatoes, capers and olives complemented
the octopus well. The skirt steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and went well with the spinach, tomatoes and goat cheese. Our pizza was the best tasting pizza we've had in a while, I'd order this one again, and I think it replaced my former favorite, the truffle pizza. Crispy chewy crust, well charred on the bottom, the bresola had a nice saltiness,
the cassatica cheese tasted more like a gooey brie, the fruitiness of the evoo, and the sweetness of the onion made every bite very enjoyable.

For dessert, we order our usual, Creamy Buffala Ricotta with Honey and Toasted Pistachios AND I just had to try their new addition-Chocolate Gelato covered  with Nueske's Applewood Smoked BACON !?!?!?!? The Ricotta is always a winner, but WOW!
this bacon made me feel like I was at a luau, because it tasted EXACTLY like Pipikaula, a popular smoked dried meat you find at luaus and Hawaiian food joints...Perfect contrast of sweet and salty with a little smokiness to it. Definitely try this if you're adventureous...ALOHA!!!!

3647656,2013-12-15,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Let me start by saying that we used to go to Due Forni at least once a month. The pizzas are not the best thing ever but they are really good and we like the atmosphere. Last time we went though we had a horrible experience.. I ordered the chef special for the night which was Scallops. I love ordering their specials from time to time if I don't feel like pizza and they are always very delicious. This time though that wasn't the case - the scallops were horrible, only barely seared on just one side and tasted sour and undercooked. I cut one in the middle even though it didn't really look appealing and when I tasted it, I was really disappointed. The waitress saw my face and asked if everything is ok, to which I explained to her the scallops were undercooked and tasted bad and she apologetically took them back. The manager/host or whoever the new guy was at the door came to our table a minute later  to ""apologize"" by LECTURING me and rudely explaining to me how scallops are cooked and how they need to be undercooked and so on and if I wanted them cooked more that what they were, he can't guarantee their texture and they will be gummy. He seriously talked to me in such a demeaning manner, like I have never ever tasted a scallop in my life and I have no idea what I am talking about by sending those back. He wouldn't even let me say a word to explain myself. Of course he offered me to order something else and was trying to sound nice but the tone he spoke to me with was overall very disrespectful. I love scallops, I eat scallops often, I have had them in restaurants in LA, NY and many other places - point is I know what scallops should taste like and I know what a perfectly cooked scallop is - those just weren't, if I am paying $28 for that dish I expect them to at least be seared on both sides! I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, I was going to just order something else, but the rudeness of this person (who I have never seen there before) was so appalling to my husband and I, that we will never return to Due Forni again because of it. Being so called regular customers, as we live close to the place, and getting treated in such way for no reason, we have no willing to go back there ever again..

3715394,2011-04-17,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"A very pricey pizza place.  I've said before in another review that I have a hard time paying a lot for Italian food, and this place is expensive.  We paid over $50 for a pizza that was on the smallish side, an app, and 2 drinks.  It's a pizza place; $50?!?

Drinks: They have a full, but limited bar.  My husband wanted a Jack and Coke, but they don't carry Jack.  He ended up getting a Bulliet and Coke, which came in a very tiny glass.  Even though it was tiny, it was a pretty strong pour, I gotta give them that.  I had a very nice glass of wine for around $11, so not bad.

Food: Beef carpaccio for an app.  It is rolled like a sushi roll and the meat is sliced thicker than other carpaccio I've had, so you could really taste the meat.  I very much enjoyed it.  After, we ordered the Due Forni pizza.  It was $16 and I was a little dismayed at the small size of it when we got it.  More dismayed when I started eating it and there was hardly any toppings; it was a lot of dough.  That's some expensive, bare pizza.

Service: Overbearing!  The moment we walked in, we had two people greeting us with plastered on smiles from both sides of the restaurant.  When seated, a guy who I think was the manager came over and talked forever about every menu item and the ingredients in each one.  Let me look at the menu and if I have questions, I'll ask thankyouverymuch.  But the kicker was when my husband's drink was finished...3 different people asked if he wanted a refill literally within 30 seconds.  Too many hands in the cookie jar if you ask me.  The waitress was also very pushy when we declined dessert and kept insisting we try something.

I think I'd come here to sit at the bar and have some drinks, but I wouldn't spend that much money on the pizza again.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,4,0,3,drlLRzgjkTHIN9ArpET-NA

The neapolitan crusts aren't done right. They're not gummy and too crispy to truly be the neapolitan way. I shouldn't be able to pick up the pizza and eat it with my hands...I could here. Definite ""meh"" there. The flavors were alright, but I expected to be absolutely blown away from all the good reviews. Not so.

The appetizer we ordered (you'll see Ms. Dana's review is posted near mine date-wise; we went together, obvs) was pretty bland and food, as we all know, should not be bland. 

I guess I just don't see the hype. I'm glad that I had a KNPR reward gift for being such a good liberal and donating to the station, because I would not make the drive for this place if I hadn't had some incentive. It's not that special.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,3,2,3,-OoX4YD3im9o1999zNO_lw

Groupon had a $10 for $20 deal so I thought ""what the heck"" met my friend Kevin P so we could do a yelp challenge. As we entered, the host asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and the place was pretty empty so I thought it was a bizarre question. So he replied ""oh well,  is it ok if we seat you on the bar side"" sure that's fine, until he sat us down in a very small 2 person table next to the window away from everybody, not sure if he thought we needed alone time or what, but there were plenty of other tables open. Awkward.
We started out with the Polipo app, which was the highlight of the meal, braised mediterranean octopus, arugula, pequillo peppers, taggiasca, mint vinaigrette. Absolutely phenomenal. For our pizza, you have a choice of Roman style or Neopolitan style, we went with Margherita pizza, Neo style. Again, this is hard for me to review because I just can't get into the ""wet"" crust, all the ingredients slide off when you're eating! If I came back, I think I would try the Roman style and try out the Enomatic wine dispensers, they have 40 different wines to try, which I could pair with that octupus app.

Update:

If there is one thing that drives me nuts when I'm eating is when servers whisk away your plates the minute you set your utensil down. I like to take my time and enjoy my meal and if I'm having a good conversation, I don't like to be made to feel I'm being rushed.

I started off with the Chef's Platter and the calamari. Both were divine. The cheese and meat provided on the platter paired well with the spice in the sauce and bread. The pickles were great as a palette cleanser too. The calamari was unlike any calamari I've ever had, but it was still fantastic. For an entree, my girlfriend and I had the lasagna and a prosciutto pizza. The prosciutto pizza was awesome! I was surprised with how great it went with balsamic vinegar. The lasagna was cooked to perfection and loaded with flavor. Our server, I believe the gentleman's name was Brad, he was excellent.

For starters, we shared the appetizer polpette, baked turkey meatballs in tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.  The meatballs were excellent.  They were juicy and the tomato sauce billed on the menu as San Marzano tomato, was also very good.  It made a nice dish for sharing.

This was the first time in years that we have gotten pizza.  I know that's almost un-American but it's true.  We ordered the quattro fromaggio with bufala mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, and fontina cheeses.  The pizza made 4 large slices and was almost the perfect size for two people.  I had to bite the bullet and finish more than two slices but we all have to make sacrifices.  We ordered it Neapolitan style.  It was a treat!

A little dessert never hurts the ending of a meal and we ordered the sweet bufala mozzarella with honey and pistachio nuts.  A small size but just right for two people.  A nice ending to a good meal.

Service was excellent.  Matthew had a good sense of humor and was a top notch server.  I mentioned to one of the owners (?) that the Groupon worked the way they hoped.

Three straight visits, twice with reservations and when walking up to the podium they automatically seat us on the right side.  The last visit I asked if my friend and I can sit on the left side and we were told that's the family side or whatever.  But they sat us on the left side, against a corner wall.  I made reservations for 9pm but it wasn't busy.  

We ordered the polipo but it was lazily made this time around, it wasn't as good as my first visit.  There was about three 2 inch legs tossed in the salad, last time they were cut to bite size and seasoned well.  We did the mozarella bar also, that was good and filling so be warned.  The weird part was when we ordered appetizer and pizza I thought the server was going to space out the order but nope, they all came out at once.  Maybe we just had a lazy server that night.  So when the manager placed the pizza down next to the appetizer I had to let him know this doesn't make sense, he agreed and apologized for his server.  He took it away and corrected it, so I don't know if you want to bring that up to your server when you eat here. 

One of the pizzas we had were the bianca prosciutto which was drenched in balsamic.  It sounded good on paper and to me slightly less balsamic would make it better.  The other pizza was the vegetarian, guess who ordered that?  Not me.  But it was good on the harder crust.  If you had the vegetarian on the soft crust the pizza would bend easily and you'd probably lose some of the toppings on your lap.

My favorites are still the Tartufo and Due Forni.   Maybe I should quit experimenting with the other pies since they don't compare to these two for me. 

They have outdoor patio seating and the inside still has that nice comfort vibe.  The right side is the bar area with TVs and the actual restaurant bar.

This place has only been open a week but it was hoppin' on a Wednesday night. 

The food was good! Some things were just underseasoned.  After we added a little salt, it was very good. I'll definitely go back.

Dined as a party of 5.  We ordered the panzanela salad, beef carpaccio, gnocchi, tartufo pizza, due forni pizza, prosciutto e rugolla (sp?) pizza and the chocolate pizza.  4 glasses of wine, a beer,  and an iced tea. Bill $160, so $38 each person with tip.

The panzanela was our least favorite.  The bread/croutons were too crunchy and the cheap tomatoes a dissapointment.

The gnocchi was perfect! lovely, truffly, and al dente.

The carpaccio was very good, nice portion, pretty presentation but needed salt.

The tartufo pizza was excellent in theory but, once again, just needed salt.  

The prosciutto pizza was great and the balsamic added a sweet surprise.  Due to the nature of the prosciutto, this one was salty enough and tasty!

The due forni was a great balance of flavors with a generous amount of sausage.  We had this one the crispier roman style.  It was very good.

As a non-dessert lover, even I thought the chocolate pizza was magical! One chocolate pizza is easily enough for 6 people. it was perfectly decadent without being too rich or too sweet.

Nice selection of wines by the glass for fair prices.  Same for the beer.

Cute inside. Modern and welcoming.

The service was excellent without being obtrusive.  We had no less than 4 people check in with us in a very sincere fashion.  The owner stopped by.  They thanked us when we left too.  Always nice!  Our server was friendly and made good suggestions.  

A nice addition to Summerlin.  I'm confident they'll do well.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,2,3,4,4ctsT3ppAufjJ0SQZ-Walg
4054943,2013-01-15,5,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"As real and authentic as it gets!!  As good as it gets!!

Terri R and I were planning our next meal together and when she found out that I haven't had a good pizza in at least 3 years, she gave me a choice of 3 different places out here.  Not knowing where to go (remember I haven't had a good pizza in awhile), Terri suggested Due Forni.

When it comes to pizza in general, you have your branded commercialized choices (i.e. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc), NY Style, Chicago deep dish, and the authentic stuff.  Due Forni is the authentic stuff for sure.

Their easy one page menu, descriptions of the pizzas, and the pictures from other Yelpers immediately reminded me of my last visit in Italy.  I even knew what to expect; a thin crusted, a little runny, and a very tasty pizza that wasn't overwhelmingly saucy. If I got anything different, I would be disappointed.  

We chose the Quattro Formaggi which consisted bufala mozzarella (cheese from water buffalo milk), ricotta, parmesan, and fontina fontal (cheese from cow milk).  Your crust choices are Napoletana (cooked in their 900 degree oven, result is a chewy crust with crispy outside) or their Romana (cooked in their 500 degree oven result is a thin and crispy pizza).  We got the Napoletana and it was simply delicious.  The pizza was just what I expected and exactly what I've experienced in Italy itself.  The inside decor, seating, and colors even reminded me of some restaurants in Firenze.

Service was great and the waitress took the time to give me, since I am the noob here, a detailed description of everything on the menu.  She also reminded us that we can add any type of topping on our pizza of choice.  Authentic pizza without the European prices equals a perfect a deal. 

You really can't go wrong with Due Forni if authentic pizza is your thing.  If you enjoy the Americanized branded pizza, Chicago Style or New York Style, then Due Forni may or might not be for you.  But if you ever experienced a pizza the way it's suppose to be made and loved it, then Due Forni is a can't miss, a must try, and as good as it gets.  Visit again or bookmark it, you can' go wrong.

PS: Thanks Terri R.  Pizza slump cured!!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,13,8,5,Ntwvf957sDGXkE55dqAQSQ
4057837,2011-05-03,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Grimaldi's is still my favorite pizza in town, but Due Forni is a solid second.

The customer service here is excellent!  I recently branched outside of my usual Grimaldi's (Eastern & 215) and tried the Rainbow & 215 Grimaldi's location.  The customer service was terrible, so it was a welcome occurrence that everyone in Due Forni went out of their way to make sure my friend and I were taken care of.  No doubt, it was dead on a Sunday at lunchtime, but still, it was much appreciated.

My friend and I started with the Due Forni caprese.  This was incredible.  Please see the photo if you don't believe me.  Buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and a spicy sopressata.  Great flavor, just enough spice.  Mozzarella was fresh and yum.

My friend and I split a bottle of wine - Nero d'Avola.  Good wine, particuarly for the $32 price tag.

She ordered the Margherita pizza and I ordered the Picante.  We both chose neopolitan style. (Two choices of crust, chewy or crispy).  I had never tried sopressata before, but apparently I'm a huge fan.  The picante pizza also contained the spicy meat and I loved it!  Very good pizza with a spicy kick.

The happy hour wine is DELICIOUS and ice cold (the white, anyway), and the service at the bar was great. We had the beet salad with pesto, arugula, and shaved drunken goat, bacon gnocchi with truffle butter (very carbonara-esque), prosciutto pizza with fontina, balsamic glaze and caramelized onions, and the chocolate pizza- which was covered in powdered sugar, strawberries and Nutella. 

I can barely move right now from the indulgence but it was worth every bite. Everyone we met who was working was awesome. Very social and friendly but not over the top. 

I am from San Francisco and have been missing the food culture that SF is known for- every little bar and restaurant is outstanding.

4094652,2011-02-13,5,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"First, I want to say thanks for opening a great pizza place near me in the Southwest. It's right off of the 215 and Town Center. It's next to Hokkaido and Rachel's Kitchen. 

Next, the restaurant is very cool looking with a covered outdoor patio. I'm sure they are waiting for the weather to get warmer but they have heat lamps out there so they can use it now... hint hint =) 
The interior is sleek and urban with orange and brown accents that match their logo/theme. The restaurant is split into two sides, the dining area and and the bar area. I like this because there is a separation between both which has a different vibe for each. Dining area is much more family feel while bar is casual cool wine lounge with yummy food. OF course the centerpiece are the two pizza ovens in the kitchen area. And if you are wondering, that's the kitchen... that's it, all open. Isn't that crazy?
And you can if you want, stand up at the glass partition to watch them make your pizza. I watched them for a bit and that's when Chef Carlos said hi and told me about the open kitchen. 

I just got off work and was hungry so I went straight for the good stuff.. the pizza. There are two kinds of pizza: Neapolitan or Roman. I was like, what is Roman style. Apparently, it's like a cracker crust. I will try next time. I ordered the Picante (cuz I like it spicy), and added garlic and an over-easy egg. I love pizza places that add egg to the top of the pizza! Well needless to say, the pizza was amazing and spicy. The Sopressata, red peppers, garlic, San Marzano tomato and egg all worked together. The crust is thick enough to hold the toppings and probably a couple more. I usually dip my remaining crust in olive oil and I ended up pouring the olive oil all over the pizza - some good olive oil. 

Next time I will need to try the app, esp the Carpaccio, Gnocchi, Scampi the Mozzarella Bar, and of course more pizza. Ciao!",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,13,10,5,nSBDDY565g332uQrqRpFNw

Jazzy music playing throughout, maybe a bit too loudly, but it helps drown out the chatty diners & drinkers.  There is a PATIO!!!!  Yay!!!   Just a bit too hot today.  Unless there's a kids menu you can ask for, I can't imagine many KIDS would enjoy this place...pizza maybe, but they looked pretty fancy-pants.   Maybe call ahead & ask if that's your situation.  

drinks - tons of WINE choices, few were recognizable to me, so I need to study up.    Prices range from $6-$17/glass.  I had a $6.95 red blend (that hubs abandoned) and it was perfectly fine.   The prosecco is sweet....& really the only sweet wine on the menu.    Ditto on the BEERS (not the sweetness part).  Only corona light was a familiar sip.   An unusually high assortment of APERITIFS & 2 tawny ports (a 10 & a 20 year old).   They were out of the 10 yr port so I tried the amaro modernegro (I think I got it right).  It was citrusy smooth with a flippy finish that didn't linger too long.  I'd order again.  

FOOD---panzanella SALAD doesn't look like much, but it's awesome!    Just enough dressing to flavor the tender arugula & not drench the crazy crispy bread.  

The Caesar salad was ""good"" per hubs.  When I asked him if he'd order again, ""maybe"" was all I could get.  I didn't taste it so take it for what you will.   

The GNOCCHI is to-die-for!  We both agreed on that!   Gnocchi is a nice consistency.... not pillowy dough like you sometimes get.   More along the lines of pasta consistency & skinny.   So if you're looking for the doughy, yeasty, clumpettes you usually get, adjust your expectations & you'll enjoy. 

The LASAGNA is fancy-pants.  Tonight's selection was braised buffalo.   Another ""good"" from the food ""critic"".  Really he prefers home style, chunky, cheesy, slathered in sauce layered between over-cooked noodles so what showed up in its cute little cast iron dish really wasn't what he was expecting so it was an uphill battle from there.   I can tell you though.....he cleaned his plate!

Desserts weren't all that enticing to me.    We split the bread pudding.   Got an ""ok"" from the food ""critic"".   I'm not a bread pudding fan, so 2 bites was more than plenty for me and I'm probably not a qualified bread pusding judge.  

If you like bread with your meal, it can be ordered....but it's not on the menu.  

Service -- Sergio was a gracious server....even when the ""critic"" ordered a $6 glass of wine after asking for a recommendation.  And then shockingly didn't care for it & drank my prosecco.  

Overall, a little more ""work"" in deciding what to eat & drink.  But we'll definitely be back.   Only 4 stars because the ""critic"" didn't enjoy it as much as me, bread wasn't offered, desert was average & the loud-ish music.   Maybe we can up it to 5 next time.",FISzlNZgrFylvgX3Nl_a5w,1,1,4,LT_MciF0ERQckP4vCTIr1g

While their pizza smay not be the best in town, their apperizers and mozzarella bar are the bomb! Literally every item is wonderful; you'd be remiss to not try at least one item. When I go we usually order a bunch of apps and maybe one pizza. 

I read an article where John Curtas raves about their roasted branzino, making the most out of their super-hot oven and supreme quality offish. I have yet to try it but it sounds delish.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,1,1,4,HfPhQ0wHLMa9dXhzqxmqow
4271868,2013-08-01,3,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"After reading all the great reviews about this place and buying a Groupon or it, I was stoked to finally give it a shot. I love pizza and anywhere I can find good pizza is always a plus. 

We were seated promptly, served our waters and given menus. I was looking around the restaurant and noticed that EVERY SINGLE person was white and that we were the only minorities. So in my head I thought ""great, now they are gonna be racist and not serve us cuz we aren't white."" Not true at all, we received amazing service!! My friend said I was being a bit paranoid, which may have been true. Our server did take a while to finally take our order, but it was dinner time and the place was packed. 

As an appetizer, we opted for the polpette (turkey meatballs in marinara sauce.) A little too heavy on the breading and not enough turkey meat. I liked the meatballs better at Dom De Marco's, but they don't use turkey so you can't really compare them fairly. It crumbled easily, but the flavors were good. The waiter suggested bread to dip in the marinara sauce. That was an additional $3, but the bread was warm and soft, so I wasn't mad about that. 

As for the pizza, I wanted to be a little more adventerous than a margherita, so we ordered the Bianca al prosciutto, which had ham, caramalized onions and balsamic vinegar. I took one bite and hated it! The crust was soggy, ham was way salty and balsamic vinegar should only be used on salads. My friend thought it was an ok pizza, but only had one slice. We told our server, who then informed the manager of our disappointment. I used to work in the food industry so I know that it's an insult to send back food and I'm by far not a picky eater at all. I'm Filipino and we eat some weird stuff, but I just couldn't do the pizza. The manager offered us a different pizza, but I declined because I was full from the meatballs. The manager was very polite and understanding and said he would take the pizza off the bill. 

Our server had a worried look on his face when he offered us dessert. I ordered the chocolate gelato with bacon pieces and he assured me that it was a good choice. The manager who spoke to us earlier personally brought over the dessert and said it was on the house. Nice!!! Our server came back to explain that the bacon can be too overwhelming if eaten alone and to make sure that the spoonful had a good amount of gelato. He was right, but the dessert was delish!!

Our bill with the bread, meatballs and dessert was only $14. Since the service was excellent considering my dislike for the pizza, a hefty tip was deserved. I think I'll just stick to the margherita pizza next time.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,2,2,3,yIoK_w6W4J52p2KTeCHCoA

Feeling adventurous we went with the Roman style pizza which was pretty good, perhaps the best I've had ... in Vegas. But we are spoiled, in Brooklyn we lived near a Niçoise style pizzeria with crusts so thin, I wondered how the sauce didn't seep through. But I promise I must try the Neapolitan very soon. Be sure to try their desserts, they're simply amazing.

4451793,2013-03-15,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I've had Due Forni on my list for awhile. When I noted they were participating in Restaurant Week 2013 I knew this would be my time to go since it is in a completely different side of town from where I live. 

There were some pros and cons to my experience which leads to my decision of rewarding the A-OK rating. I mean, was it terrible? No. Was it great? No. So I have to go halfway.

Pros: 

- Delicious Sweet Bufala Ricotta - complete with toasted pistachios and artisanal honey. Honestly my dessert was the best part of my meal. It was savory with a bit of sweet and the perfect portion for a dessert to end your meal. If anything, I'd come back specifically to have this dessert item.

- The restaurant dutifully upheld RW menu and brought my friend and I everything we ordered. The waiter was bland, but not discriminate against us when we informed him we would be dining on the RW menu (I've had this experience at other places). 

- Although service was indeed slow and our waiter was incredibly scripted and boring he did not push wine or an upgrade of our meals, which I was afraid of since I have noted in other reviews patrons felt as though they were being upsold during their whole meal, which is annoying, of course.

- My friend and I dined outside on their patio which is always a nice alternative if it's available and not 100 degrees outside.

Cons:

- Insalata with mixed greens, artichokes and olives was underwhelming and I had to spit out two pieces of artichokes that had the hard exterior still on them.

- Oven Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and Spring Onions. I could not stomach the onions, one bite and I knew they were not being eaten. Maybe it's just my personal preference. The potatoes were the star of the dish. I might as well have just asked for a plate of starch, rather than having the chicken, which albeit had an interesting flavor, was so small I couldn't believe I was done with it and still hungry. Also, I can make better tasting chicken in my own kitchen. A lot better.

- Service as stated above was bland and seemed extremely rehearsed. 

- Menus are paper and placed in front of you during the entirety of your meal. Perhaps to remind you just how much you are paying for your authentically mediocre Italian food. Paper menus are silly and honestly a slap in the face to most people who believe in being enviro friendly. What is so hard about laminating and reusing?

Lastly...

So I did not have the pizza, which is their forte, of course, but I was quite disappointed in my experience. Also, I noted the chicken I had was not even on the actual menu. It seemed odd to me - did they just make up this dish for RW and slap it on the dinner menu, or is perhaps on the lunch menu? Either way, it's an odd thing in my opinion.

Would I return? Only if I was specifically invited by someone. I would never return on my own volition.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,2,3,d1XCAXjUttWnuWo3jm8bzw
4457830,2014-12-15,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"There was a Groupon for Due Forni, and I had to jump on it. I mean, who doesn't love discounts and most importantly, pizza? My boyfriend and I ordered the the Panzanella (arugalla) salad and the Neopolitan style Maiale Bolgnese pizza. The salad had a nice crunch from the ground pistachios, and the tomatoes were sweet, fresh, and juicy. 

The pizza here is definitely not your standard take-out pizza. All of the pizzas here are 12 inches. The dough is light and chewy, and it tasted a slight bit like sourdough. Nevertheless, as a big fan of crust, I gobbled it right down. The pizza was slightly wet when picking it up, but it didn't seep through the crust. You definitely have to use two hands to eat it or use a fork. 

Overall, the experience here was pretty good with friendly customer service. Without the Groupon, I think the prices are a bit steep. If they lowered their prices a little, I think I would be more inclined to visit again.",9FT7TtB8S4u1PwjkZmizkw,2,1,4,z3g3HFksqdfuB8XS1VUadA
4463801,2013-04-03,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I had been here before and was slightly impressed the first time, so I figured I would give it another go. This time, I was going for their ""Restaurant Week"" lunch menu. Our server, Brad, seemed overwhelmed with the Two - Three tables he had. My water glass was empty until 20 mins after my order had been taken. The manager had to stop by and fill it up after seeing me fiddling with it. He came by once, after my order was taken, and said, ""dont worry, I didn't forget about you guys"". 

For my app, I ordered the ""Stracciatella""(refer to pic), which had some good elements, but once 4 out of the 5 elements ran out, it was just a whole bunch of cheese and oil left over. In the appetizer, there were three tomatoes, one crustini, a few leaves of basil, two slices of sopressata, around 6 oz of bufala mozzarella, and oil. There was just WAY too much creamy, bufala mozzarella compared to everything else.

For my lunch entree, I ordered the ""Oven Roasted Short Rib Pizza""(refer to pic), which was delicious.. at first. After a while, once again, there was just way too much oil. I liked the short rib and arugula combination. Even the crispy bread withstood the watery sauce that was coming from the short ribs. After a few pieces, it wasn't appetizing or enjoyable.

For dessert, I received their ""Chocolate Gelato""(refer to pic) which was good. Silky, smooth, and decadent, just the way I like it. 

Overall, the meal was so-so, but the service was below standards, for not only people that are in the industry, but regular guests as well.

I ended the meal with some chocolate ice cream sprinkled with freshly cooked bacon. The idea was creative but I thought the bacon should have been cooked longer.

If they made the bacon crispier they could even go a step further and cover the whole ice cream with crunchy peices of bacon .

4533473,2013-01-25,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I looked forward to trying this place but I must say I was disappointed for the amount of money you spend. I think everything is way overpriced and they are probably trying to make up for the high rent in this pricey area. 

The place was somewhat crowded on 1/10/13 but still plenty of tables available. When the host seated us he asked us for our last name which I thought was an odd thing to ask? The waitress appeared to be new as she fumbled over some of the menu items but she was polite and prompt. 

The first thing I didn't like was their offering of table water-- the emphasis on bottled water and no of course the water was not listed on the menu. We should have just asked for ice water which of course was not even offered. We got suckered into a bottle of spring water. 

We ordered a salad that was amazing, not sure the name but it had pistachios mmm mm! Boyfriend and I prefer to order gluten free when it is available and were thrilled to see it was an option for a pizza crust. No allergies but would prefer when it is an option over wheat or white flour. We ordered gluten free for $4.95 extra... as a margarita pizza. 

While I appreciate the restaurant's effort to offer a gluten free option... I have to admit.. it is REALLY really bad. Just.Don't.Order.It. Do yourself a favor and go to Sammy's if you want gluten free pizza.

We told the waitress how bad the GF pizza was and she took it back and let us order a different pizza. We went with a four cheese regular crust. (dont recall actual name of pizza but I think it was a white pizza and we asked they substitute the white sauce for red pizza sauce with fresh mozzarella and basil). It was good but nothing amazing. I appreciated them getting us another pizza without any hassle. 

Boyfriend wanted dessert so the waitress brought out mini cannolli which was not officially on the menu. I didn't have any, but he didn't like them, they were too crispy. Then again no cannoli has impressed him since he had one fresh in NY. Will we be back, probably not. It was not worth the money in my opinion.",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,1,0,2,88YBfiMEnWB6kIrlUWiaWg

4620572,2011-03-21,2,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I've been looking for a place that cracks an egg over pizza. Thanks to Debbie N's review, that place is Due Forni.

The name means Two Ovens in Italian. When I walked in, the owner showed me the two ovens, which are both on full display from the dining area. (I just assumed he's the owner because he seemed very welcoming and grateful that I chose his establishment). On this occasion, I was just there to pick up a take-out order, but the interior is very classy. There is a bar area on one side with a dining area on the other.

We decided to go with the Tartufo because it's the one with the over easy baked egg. The other ingredients are black truffle, parmesan crema, fontina fontal, and roasted cremini. I didn't realize it at the time, but based on the menu description, I guess we had the Neapolitan style pizza. Each of their pizzas can be ordered Neapolitan or Roman. That's why they need two ovens. The Neapolitan is baked at 900 degrees for no more than 90 seconds whereas the Roman is baked in a 500-degree oven for 3 minutes.

Although the egg was extremely undercooked, the pizza was oh so good. It is certainly an expensive pizza if you look at the size versus the price ($20.95 for the Tartufo), but the ingredients were high quality and the crust was cooked to perfection. We paired that up with a Tricolore salad, consisting of farmers market greens, taggiasca olives, artichokes, avocado, and white balsamic. Wow was this salad excellent. Great flavor throughout with (again) high quality ingredients and a reasonable price ($9.95).

We began with two specialty cocktails from their menu, the ROMAN GODDESS and HUMMINGBIRD. The Roman Goddess had fresh blood orange juice, Elderflower liqueur and what I think was Campari? The Hummingbird had Elderflower liqueur and topped with Prosecco. A right amount of sweetness with a little bubble; refreshing. I liked both! The menu is extremely vague and my only peeve was the almost equally vague description offered by our server. I asked what other ingredients were in the cocktails and didn't receive a direct answer, twice. At least the drinks were good!

{ Appetizer }
STRACCIATELLA: Fresh Bufala Mozzarella cheese with fresh basil, grape tomatoes, and fried Sopressata. Everything was so flavorful and fresh, very harmonious as a dish. Wish they would put more than two thin slices of Sopressata though!

{ Entrée }
MARGHERITA PIZZA: San Marzano Tomato, Bufala Mozzarella, and Fresh Basil. This pizza featured such simple, but quality ingredients that made it so delicious. SHORT RIB PIZZA: Braised Short Rib, Bufala Mozzarella, Roasted Cremini, and Wild Arugula. The short rib was really good, but as a pizza, not my favorite (also, it was salty). Both were Neopolitan-style (900 degree oven, 90 seconds) and it creates a beautiful and chewy crust on the pizza.

{ Dessert }
SWEET BUFALA RICOTTA: Toasted Pistachios and Artisanal Honey. Delicious! Light, just enough sweetness, and the pistachios added a necessary texture. BOURBON CARAMEL PANNA COTTA: Vanilla Gelato and Toasted Walnuts. Yummy! I love panna cotta and this did not disappoint. Luckily, it's a relatively small dessert since it's very rich and sweet.

Service was fabulous and refreshingly, personal!

The pizza is so delicious.  They have 2 different ways of cooking the pizza - one that results in a chewier crust (Neopolitan) & another one that results in a crispy crust (Roman).  I always stick with the Neopolitan Margherita pizza - the combination of the chewy crust, yummy sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese & fresh basil on top makes for the perfect pizza for me.  

I've gotten the lasagna a few times - it changes daily based on the chef's liking & ingredients available.  It's always hot, fresh & fabulous.

I also get the caesar salad on a regular basis which shouldn't be so spectacular because let's be real here...it's a caesar salad BUT the fresh romaine, shaved parmigiano reggiano, herbed croutons, creamy garlic vinaigrette & some fresh ground pepper is so good.  The fresh ingredients they use really make a difference.  

The drinks I've had so far are decent.  They have a lot of different wines, beers, cocktails & each waiter/waitress is more than happy to suggest the perfect pairing for your meal.  

The desserts are fabulous - they change their bread pudding flavors & the gelato they pair it with regularly & they've never disappointed me.  We've also had the cannolis which were very good.  Make sure you get yourself a coffee drink before you leave as well!  I get a cappuccino with dessert each time & it's delicious.  Not bitter whatsoever & perfect amount of foam.

I love pizza! And what I love about Due Forni is they completely thought out of the box when creating their pizzas. We ordered the Tartufo with the truffle creme, mushrooms, and the fried egg. The crust was bready, but not in a bad, raw dough kind of way, while the bottom was a tad crispy. All of the ingredients had a fresh taste. The garlic bread on the appetizer menu may have been the best I've ever had! It was so fluffy, not greasy and heavy like most. Our server was knowledgeable about everything we asked him about on the menu, he even made suggestions based on our likes and dislikes. I will say the drinks are a bit overpriced. My husband ordered bourbon (Bulleit) their selection was lacking. I really wanted a sweet white wine, but was advised that what they had probably wouldn't suit my fancy. No biggie, there's a bunch of mixed drinks to chose from.

Spouse, M, and I have now dined here five different times. 

The pizzas have always been stellar, particularly the Neapolitan style. This place is UNIQUE, in that they have TWO pizza ovens, brought in from Italy: a Neapolitan and a Roman! The styles of pizza crusts are completely different. TRY BOTH, but I'll stick mostly to the more traditional Neapolitan.

They have also been quite good with non-pizza items.

This time, tho, there were a few misses, thus only 4 stars. WHY DO I ONLY REVIEW WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS! Sigh.

I'll start with the PROS. As I said, the pizzas are stellar. I have to say, of all of the Neapolitan pizzas offered in Las Vegas Valley, this place serves my second favorite crust and topping. (My fave so far? DOCG. A close third place? Settebello.) At their Super Bowl party, earlier this year, their ""lamb chop lollipops"" were INCREDIBLE. Perhaps the best lamb chops I've had in this country. (The best lamb I've ever had? Karoo Lamb, only available in South Africa.)

Now, the CONS, IE the problems yesterday. They have an octopus dish, grilled and served on a salad. The critter was overcooked, so it was tough and not was flavorful as I would have liked it. I didn't say anything, I probably should have. Also, all of their salads can be a little overdressed, but I have to say that the content of the dressings is always spot on. Next up, M thought it rather weird they would serve a cheese bread with the wonderful mozzarella+item platters. I did too, but it didn't ruin it for me. And lastly, WHY do the wines-by-the-glass prices have to be so high? I understand, their wine list is truly astounding (they currently have a GEORGE Pinot Noir by the glass, that's fantastic stuff, and rare to find on a WBTG list), but drinking there is always exorbitant, we ALWAYS wince upon the arrival of the bill. (FOOTNOTE: You can get a TASTE of any wine for 20% of the glass price, so I got to try 2 sips of that GEORGE yesterday. YAY!)

So I would say, GO HERE. GET PIZZA. I think we've tried every pizza, they are ALL fantastic. Get the lamb chops, if on the menu. Bring extra cash for the drinks. And enjoy.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,3,1,4,JF9M9UqyFMXpgFeM0X3oGQ

4848137,2014-06-29,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"This place has really gone downhill since it opened.

My first few visits, I was so excited to have a pizza place of this caliber on my side of town. I was worried that it was never very busy and am surprised it has lasted this long. Even though everyone talks about how great it is, there never seems to be anyone there.

We got busy with life and stopped going for awhile. When we returned, we were as happy as ever with our pizzas but also got the branzino, which I normally love but thought it was just OK.

With the current pizza invasion, we hadn't been to Due Forni for nearly a year. I like the nearby Settebello better and was even considering Custom Built Pizza but wasn't in the mood for the fast food setting. Since there was a Groupon, we decided to save and give Due Forni another chance. Normally I don't buy Groupons for places I've been before, but I was having a hard time justifying the price when there are other spots nearby that I like better. This visit was a mistake.

First, the host, who I think is the owner or manager, seemed annoyed that we wanted to sit inside. Whatever, he seated us. Our waiter was very strange and had a confusing attitude. I ordered root beer, and he didn't bother to tell me it was bottled. This wasn't a huge issue, but every restaurant I've ever been to that only offers bottled root beer has made sure to inform me of this before serving.

Next, we ordered a Roman margherita and Neapolitan tacchino pizza. He upsold us on a salad, but I was hoping he would do that anyway so no problem. After taking our order, he returned promptly and said, ""Roman margherita and Neapolitan tacchino, right?"" I confirmed this.

Soon after, he was breaking the egg on my husband's pizza. Tacchino pizza has no egg, so I re-read the menu and saw he had served tartufo, not tacchino. I told my husband, so he asked the waiter who then whispered in his ear, ""Sir, I heard tartufo."" My husband said he had ordered tacchino, and the waiter told him to just eat this one, and if he doesn't like it he'll replace it. WTF?

First of all, I know he didn't hear ""tartufo"" because he came back and repeated ""tacchino."" So either he forgot between our table and the kitchen, or the kitchen messed up and he didn't want to deal with it. Second, how can you tell a customer to just eat what you gave them? These two pizzas have nothing in common! Plus this pizza is $4 more, so now he was charging us more for something we didn't want. My husband's a pushover and likes both kinds of pizza, so he just went along with it. I didn't argue because I'm on medication that could make me lash out at anyone who gives me the wrong response.

My margherita pizza was disappointing as well. It tasted like it was made on a Saltine. While they always describe the Roman pizza crust as being cracker-like, I've never had it actually taste like a cracker.

Unhappy with the food and service, I doubt I'll be returning here. I find it outrageous that a waiter would tell someone to ""just eat"" his mistake without offering to replace it with the correct order in addition to charging the higher price. I used to go all out to get people to come to Due Forni, but this goofball along with the higher prices for lower quality food have put an end to that.",1bLbofVz5HEVZNhXJI0M_g,1,0,3,uCVIffQloKlVkY-jun4C0w
4885579,2015-02-01,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"We tried Due Forni tonight on a whim as we found it on Yelp. We thought we'd try something new and maybe experiment. Unfortunately, I should have asked more questions of our server prior to ordering. My husband love the prosciutto in the mozzarella bar appetizer. I loved the mozzarella and bread in the same dish.

 After that it just went downhill. 

I ordered mushroom ravioli and when it came out it looked like someone poured brown gravy all over perfectly good raviolis. I tried it and it was just an overpowering mushroom puree. I mean I really tried to like it. I wasn't going to say anything, but our server, Juan, who was so sincere and tried his best to help us, called me out on it right away. ""You don't like it, do you."" he said rather than asked me. He immediately offered me another pasta dish. I told him, ""Hey, maybe I should have asked you more questions. I thought I was ordering a basic ravioli with marinara sauce. It's my fault for not asking,"" I said. He looked confused. I said, ""I feel really American right now with expecting kind of a basic Italian dish."" I even apologized for not liking it because that's how crazy I am.

So Juan offered for me to try to gnocci with cream sauce that normally comes with bacon. I don't eat pork so we left the bacon off of it. It looked good when he brought it out as my husband was packing up his partially eaten Speck Pizza. My husband loved his pizza by the way. Unfortunately, the gnocchi was so plain it was just not a hit. I felt too bad to say anything to Juan because I could see he was sincerely trying to make it right. He looked like he took it personally that I didn't like the pastas. I even went so far as to let him pack up the remainder of my dish knowing I wasn't going to eat it.

The atmosphere at Due seemed fun and kind of chi-chi. There were lots of yuppie types sipping wine and cocktails. My husband and I just wanted a romantic, hearty Italian dinner, no frills. It just didn't seem to work out for us tonight.

But, hey, you win some you lose some. You never know if you'll discover a nice little neighborhood gem unless you experiment. Like I said, my husband loved his prosciutto and his pizza with even more prosciutto on it. I'd stay away from the pastas, thought.

When I said something, she explained that ""it"" was small so she thought we would want them together. I don't know what that means either.  Then as we tried to enjoy the chocolate pizza we had come for, she whisked away our plates & silverware even though we were clearly still eating.  The food is not worth the bums rush.

He brought out three pizzas instead of two because he was not paying attention to anything we said.  We let it slide and tasted all three.  A four cheese dealy, and thick and thin crust Margherita pizza. Got both styles of pizza.  The thin crust was ok.  I'll say about a C minus.  The thick crust was tasteless.  The crust had no taste, no yeast, sauce was some kind of undrained tomato that made my New York Style pizza watery and soggy.  Imported tomatoes are great but you have to drain the liquid off them.  You would be miles ahead using one of the California tomato products which actually has some flavor.  Waiter asked us what we thought of the pizza and we told him it wasn't good, he ignored our comments.  This place knows nothing about making a real New York style pizza.  I can't believe the good reviews.  The crust needs some longer working times to develop some flavor.

I say this because I know the restaurant business and the hardship a low review takes on the ownership, so I rarely write negative reviews. But - wow.., my meal last night was bad. Let's start with the pizza... All I can say, is stay away from the Roman pizza. It is ""thin"", kind of, but very very chewy. Not exactly an attribute you would praise or wish for with your pizza. On top of that the chefs heaped a mountain of cheese... it was terrible. The pizza look closer to something coming out of Chuck E. Cheese, then an upscale eatery. The chefs quite literally don't know what they're doing when it comes to pizza. I discovered one of their main problems when leaving. They keep their ovens floor temperatures at 150 to 200°. What that means is it's not hot enough to cook pizzas properly. It's too cold. The dough has to sit in the ovens a long time, hence drying it out. A legitimate pizza oven floor has to be between 400-800 degrees, depending upon the style. We kept our at 650 for Roman and Neapolitan styles. Secondly, in pizza, less is more. My advise is to get skilled guys in the kitchen who know Pizza and dedicate one of their ovens to doing it right. Everything else was meah.

First, off the staff is excellent and knowledgeable about the wine and the food.  In my opinion dining out for specialty pizza should be set up for sharing and having tastes of many items.  Unfortunately, I find the menu lacking in small plate / appetizer options to accompany the pizza for group dining, unless you want heavy cheeses and meats to on the side of pizza, it doesn't flow.    

Additionally, I think the Kitchen has made a rookie mistake with the San Marzano Tomatoes.  Imported Italian Tomatoes are intended for the purpose that Chef will slice open each tomato, extracting the seeds, then crush, puree or hand squeeze for the base of his sauce. My personal irritations are from the misuse of the product.  The tomatoes are a canned product, meaning they have been processed and are a ready to use base for making a sauce with one's choice of herbs and spices.  The intention is not to serve in place of a fresh tomato.  They are not making pizza sauce but instead serving them raw and unseasoned straight from the can on the pizza.  

What a shame when there is so much potential to make a great pizza sauce and really make a name for themselves is the niche business of upscale pizza, especially since they have mastered awesome pizza crust, something that is virtually unheard of in Vegas.  I would give 5 stars to both crust styles they serve.",kpC3LTST5-1qX86XB__5FQ,0,0,3,xDnkSWBDeMBc7mBhizXsoQ

Started with the Smoked Pork Belly. It was a little odd because it seemed like the pork belly was a big piece of fat. I've had a few different pork belly appetizer dishes from various restaurants and cuisines, but none seemed that fatty. It was smokey as the name states, which I'm usually not really too keen on of smokey meats, but for this, it worked. It was served on a wooden plank with greens and blueberry. Odd combo, but I didn't hate it.

We also ordered the Due Forni pizza and the Daily Lasagna. The Due Forni pizza was good, but there was some really odd flavor in it that I couldn't make out, and I wasn't crazy about it. However, the Daily Lasagna was top notch. It was a bechamel sauce with sausage inside and CHEEEESSSEE. Wow, that lasagna killed everything else and allowed that visit memorable.

5028825,2012-03-29,1,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"""Due Forni Pizza and Wine"" has unique pizzas and a variety of wines on its menu. It has attentive serving staff and comfortable ambience (in a weekday afternoon anyway). Its bar appears quite inviting. The enclosed patio with very large windows is nice, though facing only the relatively quiet parking lot by S. Town Center Dr. The menu is the same for both lunch and dinner; its prices a bit high for lunch, especially the wines, but OK for dinner.

It offers two kinds of crust for pizzas. My wife and I tried the thin/crispy type with speck. It had a rugged presentation, but its PROSCIUTTO and crust were delicious in every bite. The Caeser's salad was also excellent. Our glasses of red wine ($12.95/glass) were excellent but a bit too pricey [Wine prices vary from $8-$15/glass for average wines, and $20-$50/glass for the more exotic].

We were there in a late weekday afternoon, thus, only a few tables of guests there. Our attentive, friendly server told us that the restaurant got busy usually after 6pm.
- No, Due Forni does not offer special ""Happy Hour"", but does offer $5/glass of selected wines from 5-7pm, as well as ""Wine Sampling"" at 20%discount per glass.

We finished our meals before 6:30pm that evening, so we did NOT see any ""Happy Hour Type"" of crowd typically swarming at popular Roy's, Kona Grill, or Gordon Biersch around 3-7pm. The manager came over to ask us, quite sincerely, how we enjoyed our dinner - a very nice touch. We liked that. Yes, we plan to give Due Forni another try some weekends, when there will be a larger crowd.

In Short:
- If you like good pizzas, nice but slightly more expensive wines, and QUIETER ambience, say, for a late lunch/early dinner, then Due Forni is worth a try. But, if you prefer a more exciting (happily noisier) atmosphere of the happy hour with good food/drinks, then there are other better places than Due Forni.

You can still get the pizza Due Forni is famous for (like the Tartufo), but the other dishes on the menu are what you want to focus on. My recommendations are the chef's platter (with cheeses like a cheddar with an espresso rind that was crazy-good), the gnocchi (with a truffle crema) and the cioppino (with fennel in the broth that made me realize I need to cook with fennel more at home). I missed out on the pork belly this time, but I'm definitely looking forward to it on my next visit.

The beverage menu is also extremely notable, with many selections of wines and beers that I never see on any other menu (like a pale ale made in Italy that was the best Italian beer I've ever tried). The whiskey menu is also very deep with selections from Arizona to Denmark. 

Overall the food and drinks were outstanding, the prices were reasonable, and the location continues to feel comfortable and inviting from the patio in front to the bar in the back. I should also mention the servers and hosts were all extremely friendly and knowledgable about not just the food but the wine as well (something I always watch out for).

Also, the degree of service was very consistent, even with the 6 staff members we had encountered. Thank you.  And please keep it up. 

After work today, I rushed to make it in time for their happy hour, which ends at 6:30pm - and yes, I made it.  I basically ordered 4 out of the 5 dishes they had available on the HH menu. The first one was the vegetarian flatbread with penne basil, roasted sweet cherry tomatoes, and parmegiano reggiano (the cheese might negate the vegetarian label, though) - very delicious, to say the least.  We also ordered the meatballs, which were quite good; but I wouldn't say they were the best.  Their prosciutto wrapped dates with goat cheese were not as sweet as Firefly's, but might rival it both in quality and as an overall side.  I wanted to order another plate of it, but got full too quickly.  Their oven baked goat cheese dish was very simple, too, with house-made bread and a lightly fried mixture of bacon, goat cheese spread, along with some thinly sliced apricots.  The chef also decided to give us the fifth and final happy hour menu item: the Gnocchi, on the house, which has a bit of a lovely spice, along with their sausage.  I was very surprised that the chef did that.  I guess the chef wanted us to try the whole HH menu, which is a pretty great list.  

I did, however, want to try their oxtail soup that I had read about a few weeks ago.  Sadly, they had removed it from their HH menu.  On a happier note, this led me to check out the other dishes from their regular menu.  We ended up getting the Due Forni pizza with the Roman style crust.  And I have to just thank them for making an amazing concoction of a pizza. The meat, the sauce, whatever was put in there made it so delicious. And the crust - the crust! It was crispy and light, just how it was intended.  After everything I had eaten here, I didn't even feel like disgusting and gross, and regretting what I had eaten.  Perhaps I didn't eat as much as I thought I did or maybe the food just wasn't of the greasy type. 

Overall, I had a wonderful experience here.   I cannot wait to try out the rest of their menu.",K536-wsQXCN7bZaPM0RDng,2,0,5,yN58XdnEhEtUMuAHzHmhcg

The pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.

Tried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive ""stuff"" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).

It's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect ""octopussy"" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).

The mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.

50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  

Bottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,25,20,4,TieKS3gFmylbbpkKVXzLlQ

We came here on Friday night later, so the place was kind of emptied out. 

For their menu, they seem like a semi nice/casual dining. The seating is casual. 
They have a good wine selection, but the food selection is a tad smaller. 

So we tried: 

The Lasagna on special. It was an odd one. It was braised short rib with squash and zucchini. It didn't sound good at all, but the waiter insisted. Honestly, it was really good. We were both pleasantly surprised. 
I had the Tartufo pizza. Because - truffle. I love truffle. The smell, the taste. It hits my spot. Whatever that means. :)
It was delicious. And I was even hesitant about the egg, but if you are--DO NOT BE! It was quite the topper for this delectable dish. 

The waiter was super friendly and very knowledgeable. Maybe a little too knowledgable. In the way that he went into crazy detail about the food. But, he was super passionate about his job. Which is a great thing. 

Overall, I would love to try it again and have other dishes. It's just a little further for us. But when you have good food and booze, it's worth going a little out of your way.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,24,16,4,4bvqlHNvrgqCmmgEf9_kJw

I had the Neapolitan Margherita. 

It was similar to Settebello in the fact that it tries to imitate authentic Italian style in a wood oven, but that's where the similarity ends (As I gave Settebello 5 stars).

The sauce had a good flavor as I don't like a real strong acidic pizza sauce and this had a delicate flavor. 

Cheese consisted of the basic gobs of mozzarella. 

The dough was a bit over-baked and you could taste a burnt bread flavor in every bite coming from the bottom due to it being left in the oven about 30 seconds too long.

Waitstaff was friendly.

This is a swanky pizzeria...nice setup, great service, friendly waitstaff.  Prices are fairly high IMO, but since this was a restaurant week menu, the value was definitely there!

Started off with the Stracciatella :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/due-forni-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#72Gs4xMnE-j2j731VEdzVA

Which has fresh basil, tomato, and sopressata. The wife really liked this, but it didn't do much for me truthfully.  A bit soupy with the cheese...dunno, not for me.

The Caesar salad :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/due-forni-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#buDRCJqIstPhsIAkybXy3w

Consisted of Romaine hearts, herb croutons, parmesan, garlic vinaigrette. Good flavors here...got me to eat a bit of it, and I hate lettuce!

Entrees!  Short Rib Pizza :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/due-forni-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#VEV0RNGNULv34WGTWH_CVw

Made of braised short rib, bufala mozzarella, and roasted cremini. Good, but not quite mind blowing like I thought it would be!  I had really high expectations for this, but what I got was a mushroomy pizza with a lot of ""juices"" sitting on top...kind of runny and watery, albeit a decent pizza overall.  I guess I am not a big fan of this style of pizza, since Settebello didn't do much for me either.  So take this part of the review with a grain of salt.

However, what WAS mind blowing was the Panino!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/due-forni-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#LJ88OvtQpSqszMYYGnFt2w

Which is braised pork belly, fontina, and caramelized onions. This was amazing! Super fatty, oily, and delicious!  Too rich for the wife's tastes, but I absolutely loved this!  Highly recommended!

And last but not least, Dessert!

I really like choco gelato, but the PC blew it outta the water, and I scraped out each and every little bit in that cup!  If I make it back here again, I will order this 100% for sure!

Most of the pizzas here are $16-20, so they are a bit spendy.  But since this isn't really my style of pizza anyways, I would be hard pressed to return, just to order the sandwich and Panna Cotta again lol.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,3,3,4,WUBs0zH5ktEInEocq368Nw

The husband proclaimed it the best in the world, which may be an overstatement, but we got the play by play on its preparation. First, they only use Spanish octopi because the fishermen in that fine country immediately coat their catch in salt creating a more tender product for everyone to nibble. Then, it arrives at Due Forni where they marinate (I am afraid that might not be the correct word exactly, but...) it for a substantial amount of time, and then prepare it with love.

I'm sure I'm missing out on part of the magic of this restaurant by not ordering the egg-goo pizza, so perhaps this would be a 5 star review if egg-goo was my thing. 

The decor of this place was awesome - chic, clean, and modern. Service was quick and polite. We ate here on our lunch break so I appreciate good service when I'm trying to dine quickly. 

We settled on the gnocchi and the prosciutto pizza . The gnocchi wasn't dense like most gnocchi I'm used to, but was utterly fabulous. The bacon was divine and the peas and light sauce were perfect. YUM. 

The pizza was pretty damn good, but I like Settebello FAR better. The crust was very similar, but I found the cheese/topping ratio at Due to be off. I didn't really taste any cheese, but my pizza was covered in tons and tons of proscuitto and salad. I will say, ounce for ounce, you're getting a ton more meat on the pizza here, but it was in obnoxiously huge pieces there were impossible to eat without cutting. But then cutting the meat ended up making the entire pizza fall apart. Settebello just holds together better. Also, I love the Carbonara pizza at Settebello featuring a FULLY COOKED (and goo free egg!). Additionally, the prices at Settebello are much better. I felt like I was eating good pizza dough with tons of meat and salad on it here. The balsalmic on it was tasty, but just added to my meat salad feeling I was getting. Truffle oil and more cheese would have served this pizza well ! 

I do love Italian style pies, so I'm pleased to have another option in Vegas. Don't miss the fabulous pasta, this place has many exciting options besides pizza !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,8,7,4,3topbsxRpB6kxgRrT1Kb2g

Once deemed worthy of a trip from the Strip by Rental Car, and since opening and shuttering a second location in Austin, Texas' loss is Sin City's gain as Carlos Buscaglia is finally back full-time to focus on Due Forni on Town Center Drive, the product never really suffering in the interim, though likely to benefit with one of the city's most underregarded Chefs now spending less time in transit and more creating new plates or spending time with his family nearby.

Now celebrating over six years making Summerlin's best Pizza, the signature two-oven format spinning out crispy Roman or pliable Neapolitan Pies with the sort of char that has more than once made patrons assume them to be wood, it was actually Carlos' Instagram shots of two new items that enticed a party of three to escape the rain on Saturday, Brunch just past eleven o'clock finding the restaurant quiet with only Chef Buscaglia and one server present for the first half-hour.

A place equally accessible to children as it is traveled gourmands, the well-priced Wine list frequently cited by local Oenophiles as one of the city's best deals, it was briefly after seating in front of a Television showing Sports that an order was crafted, the restaurant's eponymous Pizza cooked up crisp with a light char but good foldability quick to arrive with a sauce of pure Tomatoes plus a little seasoning providing the backdrop to smoked Bacon and aromatic house-ground Sausage.

Speaking with Carlos about new ideas, the possibility of Meatballs becoming Bovine-based soon prompting an order, one questions that direction given the deep flavor and springy texture of a current rendition made from Turkey, the unannounced  decision to charge $3 for puffy Pizza-bread to soak up the Cheese and Sauce understandable, but something that should probably be included even if it needs to be figured into the hot skillet's menu cost.

Taking a look at one of the Brunch plates, a smoky Short Rib Hash finding shredded Beef ever-so-slightly crisped next to diced Spuds and Caramelized Onions beneath two over-easy Eggs, those looking for something new are encouraged to consult the Happy Hour menu, the description of ""Smoked Pork - Garlic Bread, Calabrian Peppers, Onion, Melted Fontina"" doing no justice to a skillet of Garlic Knots as soft as Parker House Rolls topped in glazed Pork Belly and a dollop of Cheese blended with bright heat plus onions cooked sweet and soft.

Tempted by more food, but knowing better than to overdo it with plans for dessert, Due Forni's monthly Bread Pudding achieves a new level of success by way of the ""Memphis Mafia"" clearly created with The King as an inspiration, the lightly browned top slowly melting a ball of Gelatology Vanilla Gelato into custard-infused Bread intermingling with Pecans, Peanut Butter Cups, Bananas and Bacon.

****1/2  Limited only by its kitchen and nearby clientele, the former featuring only the ovens plus a simple stove while the latter is notoriously renowned to line up at Bonefish Grill or PF Changs, Due Forni continues to shine with the sort of creativity rarely seen even in the Strip's upscale Italian eateries with the bill tallying nearly half the cost.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,5,IKj5WwjKw2CriQ7FMSDBjA

On our first try here, my husband and I were on ""date night,"" in other words, ""sans enfants.""  We started with the Chef's Platter of meats and cheeses.  We were very impressed to hear the server reciting every item on the platter with ease, from how she pronounced it (well, what do I know, I'm not Italian) to knowing the origin of each item.  Pretty good!  We commented on our journey we once had to Henderson (no, not a region of Italy, just the other side of Las Vegas) to Valley Cheese & Wine, in which we had sought out some specialty meats.  Surprisingly, the server knew what we were talking about and suggested we try  their selection!  It's always good to know that your server is well-versed with his/her menu.  PLUS!

The pizza was amazing!  Melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Roman crust or Neopolitan crust, your choice!  What really stood out, in my opinion, was their Panzanella Salad, made with arugula, onion, tomato, toasted pistachios, etc. with a light balsamic vinaigrette!  Just the way I like it!  The other stand-out-in-the-crowd item came from their dessert menu!  Lord Have Mercy!  You must try their Sweet Bufala Ricotta, rich ricotta with honey and pistachios!  Good Lord!  It was amazing!

Lastly, we took a stab at Due Forni a second night, this time with the children.  Gotta admit, unless your kids have a worldly palate, they won't be as impressed as the adults are.  They did enjoy the Chef's Platter, but as a suggestion for pizza?  Stick to the Due Forni pizza, tomato, mozzarella, sausage and bacon (all exquisite ingredients), minus the oregano and peppers.

Then we moved onto dessert and got the chocolate pizza. It had good flavor but was nearly impossible to eat. I guess I don't like their pizza crust. I make better crust at home. Their crust has no flavor. Ill give it another try in a couple weeks to see if my opinion changes.

5373777,2012-01-07,2,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Hospitality looks to be a fundamental aspect of their business, because my friend and I got fantastic service from entry to departure. We entered the building to find no one at the host podium, but the bartender greeted us. Not too long after, we were not only greeted by one but two people before being guided to our table. Brief introduction of who our server would be, water filled, and suggestions were made. Ivan, our server, was attentive yet knew when lay back. It reminds me of a fine dining atmosphere without the over the top prices.

We began our meal with the Pulpette ($9.95). An order of these turkey meatballs came with six golf ball size pieces. The meat was tender and moist, but nothing spectacular. The San Marzano tomato sauce was the opposite. It was my favorite part, making me wish I had bread to sop it up. Instead I just used the spoon. I shared a little before the rest went into my mouth.
 
The proof is in the crust. As my least favorite part of a slice of pizza, it tends to be the first portion to be devoured. Although I still ate my pizza backwards, the crust was completely enjoyable. We got two pizzas made Neapolitan style. If I must eat crust, it better be chewy instead of thin and cracker like. The Tartufo ($20.95) is pricey, but justifiable after the first bite. Well maybe fifth, since I eat mine crust first. The egg that is broken and scrambled at the table adds a sense of showmanship that was appreciated. The Bianca De Proscuitto Cotto ($14.95) was my friends favorite. The ham and onion combo was nice, but the balsamic was unnoticeable. When it was time to divide leftovers, there was no mix and match, we just went for our preferences. The good thing about Due Forni is that they do have pizzas for any palate. 

If you saved room for dessert, definitely get their signature Sweetened Ricotta($6.95). Thing of the filling of a cannoli in a cup. The creamy cheese is sweetened with layers of honey and sprinkled with toasted pistachios. Decadence without chocolate. Who knew that was even possible.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,4,4,ISGVdbby2jxf7SiKb3NmNA

We sat out on the patio since the weather was so nice for a spring evening.
Our waiter was pleasant and was happy to answer questions. My husband and I didn't want to fill up or have leftovers since we were going out of town in a few days. So we decided to split the Due Forni Neapolitan style. It was good, just nothing special. The price was high for such a small pizza. I think I'll stick with my current favorite Grimaldi's.
We split the Bacon topped Chocolate Gelato for dessert. It was good but felt like it needed something...we decided either caramel sauce or pretzel crumbles would've done the trick.
Since the restaurant wasn't too busy we hung out and talked at our table for a while after we ate. The waiter was awesome and continued to make sure our water glasses were full.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,2,0,3,V6xwOegK-t12pZK81dhhJQ

The prices are what really brought down their rating for me.  My wife and I spent $60 for lunch having only one pizza, one pasta, and one glass of wine. That's an expensive lunch.

Pizza was perfectly charred from the oven just how I like it.  The kitchen did a terrible job at cutting the pizza so each time we tore off a piece all the toppings fell off into a messy pile.  The pizza is good, but like I said it's a bit pricy and there are better places out there.

We had the gnocchi which was amazing.  We got the one with bacon, peas, and truffles.  I would come back for just this dish.

I had a glass of one of their cheaper reds, I didn't want to pay too much for glass of wine at lunch. The one I got was terrible, but for $8 the wine should be palatable no matter where you go.

It's the best pizza in Summerlin which is convenient for me, but I would rather take the long drive to Settebello for good pizza.",KlD2U69cqxi01TelonOtxw,6,1,3,loMxhkuhWS4fBNzNbBEoSg

When we got the bill the prices we're off by $6.00 on one drink and $2.00 on the other. When we asked about it, and let the bartender know the web site information we saw, her reply was ""yeah, they JUST changed the prices yesterday and they haven't updated our web site yet."" I pressed it slightly to see what they would do and she just said ""yeah, there not really anything I can do.""  Didn't offer to talk to the manager or even a real apology about the mix up. A gentleman walked up to the bar and he appeared to either be a manager or shift supervisor to some degree. I mentioned it to him and he said the same thing about the recent change. I was fine paying it, but it was amazing to me that there was not even the slightest attempt to make it right. I'm not sure if web sites are considered ""advertising"" but, if they are, this was certainly misleading. The website should have been updated before the price change, not after. 

The food was not bad but not great. We ordered calamari and a pizza. The calamari was good, but the bread that came with it was burnt on the edge. I broke the burnt part off and write it off as not a huge deal. When they brought the pizza out there were three sections around the crust that were really burnt. The bottom had several burnt patches as well.

Short staffed, invisible management, poor kitchen communication with front staff.

After talking to the waitress, she promised me she will fixed it.  Well.....they put it back in 800+ degrees oven...and cooked it more.....hellllllo??????   You burnt it on top.......!......and the bottom......I could not believe it.  I refused to it ...and returned it...and ate nothing.    Management needs to do some major retooling and training of kitchen staff.  Also, waitress....did not have a system to allocate the actual items ordered.  Put a number starting with a seat...and go around....and don't come to the table saying ""pizza Margarita???""...waiting for the customers to raise their hands.  Come on!  My son waited 20 minutes for his soda.  You brought an extra appetizer.  My wife got a regular pizza and was supposed to get a gluten free.....and the cherry on the cake?....you also did not remove the ""returned uncooked pizza"" from the bill.

The wine selection here is absolutely delish! If you don't know too much about wine, ask your server, they never steer you wrong!

The pizza was actually pretty good though.  I chose the Bianca Al Prosciutto Cotto.  It features cooked ham, fontina, caramelized onions, oregano, and aged balsamic.  I don't get pizza featuring prosciutto often but this one was pretty good.  The caramelized onions was a nice touch.

The roman margherita was just ok. We weren't crazy about the crust but I think that's just our preference. Will probably be the one and only time we get roman. Glad we tried it though.

They import their tomatoes and mozzarella. The mozzarella is ""mozzarella di bufala"" or water buffalo mozzarella brought in directly from the capital of mozzarella - Campania! You absolutely MUST get the mozzarella ball (get it plain with a side of prosciutto - the taste is so incredible by itself without any of the extra toppings they offer). The pizzas come in two different crusts (roman and Neapolitan). Neapolitan is traditional Italian pizza preparation. Fabulous! There are two wood fire ovens that bake the pizzas and they were also imported from Italy.

Due Forni is off-Strip located in a small corner in Summerlin and is a must go! It's my absolutely most favorite restaurant in Vegas and not just for the food but also for the service.

Atmosphere 5/5: The atmosphere of the restaurant is modern with some TV hung on the wall. You feel to be in an upscale environment the minute you enter in the restaurant which is great for a restaurant outside the Strip.

Food 5/5: I tried the Carpaccio which is served differently to the regular one we're used to eat. The meat is rolled around some mixed green and nuts. The idea was great and the meat litterally melt in your mouth! We ordered finally 2 different versions of the Pizza, the  Neapolitan and the Romana. The  Neapolitan Pizza has a thicker and more spongious texture while the Romana has a thinner and crispier crust. I would go for the Romana if you're looking for something lighter and tastier. The Speck Pizza is phenomenal and the prosciutto is Delicious! We also had the Due Forni and it was excellent as well.

The carpaccio was uniquely delicious the prime beef smooth and soft. We also tried the Panzanella salad again wow! We found this place because we wanted to try something different, but it blew our minds! And the Wild Boar lasagna woa!!",Q9ktbNoBStmQVl3JiwVIGQ,0,0,5,y8vd8GDwPbyKsPKDY5sYWQ

We order the 4 cheese pizza & proscuitto pizza. They were both excellent and came to the table quickly. We shared a mixed green salad which had a wonderful light dressing. The wait staff & owner were both quite attentive. We will definitely be back.",y71hcTCUYm9YjSEKlWhZBg,5,2,5,ismgbL8h1cmn2XkbB1-BrA

5891152,2013-04-09,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I love Due Forni. It is such a great place: food's amazing, customer service couldn't be better and the restaurant has a really laid back atmosphere that really makes you feel welcome.

There are plenty of wine options at really affordable prices. Don't be shy to ask server for advice. 

Due Forni pizza -Romana- is my favorite. There are a lot of comparisons with Settebello, also great- but IMHO what sets Due Forni apart from competitors are wine options and appetizers, including the truly superb  mozzarella bar. Not to miss!!

Ps- Try the chocolate and bacon ice cream!! You will be surprised.",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,0,0,5,zqI4N-HfoPPhMjHP71RpBA
5893306,2016-05-05,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I'd been hoping to try this place for quite a while, and finally dined solo during Happy Hour on a HOT & slightly windy day! Not to be beaten by the Vegas weather, I dined on the patio.

The bar inside was busier than the patio & dining room but I liked the enclosed  patio with the open windows better. I started with the mixed greens with pickled seasonal fruit, which this month is kumquats! Very tasty those kumquats, and they should have more pickled fruits in a salad. That would be awesome!

I also had the Due Forni pizza, Neapolitan style, which is a thicker crust. It was a very good pizza and I liked the bacon more than the sausage on the pizza. There were plenty of toppings, and the red peppers were OK, but hot peppers would be a great option instead! It's a quality pizza, and at $17 I'm not sure I'd come back & get another pizza. I ate half of it, opting to take the rest, but could've finished it all in one sitting no problem. I had a glass of white wine which was good and $5 at Happy Hour. 

The complex this place is in seems like a neighborhood center, which may explain why it wasn't busy. It's not the best location. Due Forni has been open 5 years, and though Downtown Summerlin is close, it's a nice little neighborhood spot.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,1,4,npmi7JGw5LoF1oYeN7lGSg
5918841,2012-01-05,1,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"I missed the Yelp Due Forni party awhile back, but finally had a chance to drop by and check out their specialty pizzas.

The menu is pretty simple. Two styles of pizza crusts to select from. I personally enjoyed the chewy Neapolitan crusted Tartufo pizza, but I can live without the raw egg that is broken at the table and spread over the pizza, which didn't have sufficient heat to cook the scrambled egg.  But it is still safe, it is pasteurized.

The surprising part of the meal was the organic Mint Camomile tea that is on the 'dessert' menu. I had it with my pizza and it basically cleanses my palette after every sip.

If you enjoy watching games (football and basketball) with a few good slices of pizza, this is a good spot to drop by.

Alex, I believe is the owner or manager was very nice. He spoke to every customer that I could see seated on the side of the restaurant I was sitting at (bar side).  It definitely had a positive contribution to the dining experience.

And if that is not enough to convince you to check out Due Forni, I overheard that MOF Chef Jean Philippe (of Jean Philippe Patisserie) also drops in for pizza from time to time.  As well as many of the French chefs that works in Las Vegas.

5931534,2012-01-16,0,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,Went to this place with MG for dinner.  The food was pretty good and the service was outstanding.  Attentive but not overbearing.  We started off with the mozarella bar with prosciutto.  Pretty damm good...Then we had the margherita pizza which was good; nothing great.  Had some prosecco with dinner and some sparkling water after the meal.  Best part was dessert: gelato.  Yummy!!!  Bill came to about $80 with tip...Would definitely revisit...,43JU_n9LO7sr8N-8hNcs3A,0,0,3,6gKYZ_LLiN8MvPfIBS1uhA

I'm short and we were sat on a HIGH table and I felt like a little kid. Food was overpriced with average portions and a ""fast food"" atmosphere with a high end attempt at ambience. If I just wanted a pizza I may go back but not really my choice for an ""upscale Italian meal"" at the prices they charge.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,1,0,3,mUU97OOltvYjVoLHdeX88w
5948337,2011-07-02,1,bPcqucuuClxYrIM8xWoArg,"Well, if you want a great pizza, fresh salad and great atmosphere, Due Forni is a great local spot in Summerlin!  
 Started of with a Moretti on draft! Refreshing!! Then orderedtheTricolore Salad. Fresh, light and delicious! Now for the pizza. The Margherita was the choice. Mozzarella, tomatoes and basil. About as simple as you can get. Neopolitan crust!!! Crisp, yet chewy, the way pizza crust shoule be!! Yummy yum yums!! One pizza was just enough for two people. I should have ordered two! Next time, I look forward to ordering the Tartufo, truffles and a baked egg on top, and the Due Forni, with their homemade sausage!! 
 Over 25 wines by the glass, and a great semi enclosed patio, Andy and his staff have it going on!!! 
 Till my next visit.....

I was first caught off guard by the unique ingredients and amazing wine and beer list. I decided to be adventurous and try something I normally hate and I was not only pleasantly surprised, I was in love. The staff was friendly, the food was amazing, and the dessert was even better.

We finally made it here for a lunch today. I ordered the gnocchi lunch while my fella had the Due Forni pizza neopolitan style. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. I also ordered the fresh brewed iced tea, mmm. All the food was beautifully presented and was incredibly flavorful.

My fella was close to declaring this his favorite pizza place in town. It's definitely a tie for second to Grimaldi's with Settebello for me. I can't wait for another trip here, next time for dinner.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,6,5,FuL0wcEwBwMRKe2RNy59eQ

The staff is very friendly and not snobbish at all, which seems to be a problem at other restaurants of this quality. I even had a manager come to the table to suggest some food items and a very good whiskey (Yamazaki.) 

If you do go, you can't go wrong with the beet salad. I get it every time I go. 

They have an excellent selection of wine and some very good beers which I don't see many other places.",5KzS8xgVJHOY1_L5XcraaA,3,2,5,hMpiC9BGv8X4aom4dXN16w
