There have been several Vietnamese restaurants at this location over the years, but Pho Kitchen is a new restaurant with a new owner. Pho and Bahn Mi are both great.

Also have tried their Pho satay which was also delicious, a different taste from typical Pho. Their egg rolls are also good. Only flaw is menu inconsistency, otherwise it's a five star Viet restaurant. What I have pictured is a rice plate-- com suong (pork chop) with egg.

The egg Roll are sooo... good , and the BBQ pork so flavorful ...Yummmy.

The owner daughter is so sweet , so friendly , very nice and when you received the good service it makes your dining wonderful.

Pho Thai- noodles were just right! Soup's flavoring was delicious!!

Pork vermicelli- Crispy egg rolls were yummy. Sauce was a bit bland. Pork was great! Wish there was a bit more though. 

Customer service- ok. Not the friendly smiles you'd expect but they were prompt.",7jLbsvtBHy43r_68JDfEbQ,1,1,4,-mLU9DLoHkuMJsn8rWl8Lw
1829560,2017-10-02,0,E2inSSpEOeOnC1reFPC2-w,"A bit disappointed with this place due to the good reviews it has received thus far. Pho Kitchen is in the same plaza as the Greenland Market, next to Lee's KBBQ.

I walked in to a nice, clean open restaurant. The worker asked me how many and I said take out. He walked to the counter and held out a menu. I thought he was going to give it to me but he just stood there looking at me with the menu out. I walked over to the counter and took it myself. I then ordered #24. He said ""do you want egg?"" I replied saying ""it says it comes with two eggs with the rice dish."" He looked at the menu closely with a frustrated face, mumbled and scribbled into his pad.

When my food was done he just stared at me from the counter. When I looked over he said ""ready"" and walked away. Once again, I had to walk over to the counter to get my food. Ok so service isn't the best but that is commonly found in a lot of Asian restaurants. Now onto the food and let's see if it makes up for the lack of service:

The eggs were too overcooked for my taste. There wasn't enough meat for the amount of rice given. I generally get more meats at other Vietnamese restaurants. The meat itself wasn't too bad but still mediocre. 


I wanted to like this place, as it was conveniently close to where I work, but I will not be returning.",vS4AxqL42Y7r741YOJ62_A,2,0,2,yW7wZFGALYCUi8UGvE10oQ

3833983,2017-09-10,1,E2inSSpEOeOnC1reFPC2-w,"Okay, years ago we loved this place under different owners. When they sold we gave them 2 chances and said we would never come back. New owners and management have resurrected a gem. We were heartbroken when Pho Vietnam Grille closed. We have searched high and low for that quality and flavor. 
We have finally found our new go to Pho joint. The broth was delicious before putting any condiments in it.  There was no trace of MSG. I flush if there is.  There was no trace of the cloying greasy flavor of cheap restaurant Pho. The veggie option was filled with fresh veggies that are normally not as diverse. I loved it. My husband had #7 combo Pho and he was very happy. We have been searching for a place this good for a long time. We have tried many places once.  This is one we will come back to over and over. 
The Bahn Mi was really good. Not great , is just really good. The BBQ pork in it was delicious, just a little too much mayo for our taste. 
It opened my sinuses  and seared my throat. I felt like I was coming down with something when we came in and felt great when we left.  Pho is my favorite cure for a cold. It works almost immediately. 
The prices were very reasonable. We got out of there under $25.00 and we had to take home half a sandwich and 1/3 bowl of Pho. Service was friendly and efficient. Table next to us was boisterous and loud until their Pho came and then silent. Eating good food soothed the chaos in the dining room.",5HjilK4MaY1XGzhx6EWzLQ,2,1,5,nKuRysBcAYXfoGqBLn2TtQ

Pho Kitchen offers one of the better bowls of chicken pho around here. The dark meat used is tender and not dry (which is how pho ga tends to be). Savory broth. 
Good amount of pho noodles. My boyfriend always gets the pho with beef balls and rare beef and says that it too is delicious. 
Interestingly quiet restaurant but don't let it deter you from trying their food.
I haven't tried any of the other dishes- just pho! Too good to try anything else, but there are several more noodle and soup combinations offered.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,2,1,4,qxuH6rGzSmVuX6hq86YHCA
