The octopus, grilled feta, and beet salad were spectacular starters. The medium rare lamb was divine. I can't spell or pronounce the dessert we ordered, but it was extraordinary. I rarely write yelp reviews, but this dining experience inspired me. As a native New Yorker, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find such authentic Greek flavors in vegas.

We started with the octopus grilled and roasted organic beets that was laying in a mound of dandelion Greens called Horta.  I was transported back to my Greek roots the minute I ate the beets and Horta.   Horta being a staple dish in my house growing up....my mother would go into the fields and pick the most delicious greens for us.  I had the Tspoura (grilled sea bass) that was cooked to perfection and my other half had the Colorado lamb chops that were fabulous.  Our friends had the roasted chicken with potatoes and her husband had a pasta with shrimp dish.  I am so looking forward to returning to this fine restaurant.  The service was perfect as well as the atmosphere.

1167807,2017-11-22,1,mvLdgkwBzqllHWHwS-ZZgQ,"First off all, I'm reviewing this place coming from not only a Greek family first generation... but all Greek food has to compare to my mom's, which coincidently is better than anyone else's moms food and that's just the truth.

That being said, I've been in vegas almost 20 years listening to people recommend Greek places like ""hey try that place behind the gas station"" or ""this one place had great Greek food... the chef is Korean so it has a Korean flair..""

Anyway after so so so so so many disappointments in this town, my spirits have been lifted finally, and I found honest to goodness Greek food. I'm going by the soup and how the chicken was prepared, the breads tsatsiki tomato coffee and galactobouriko. All were quite good to excellent. My favorite soup the kotosoupa was $6! (You hear that Milos you robbing overpriced bastards charged me $28 for a crappy tomato) and way I digest.

For those that complain about the service sometimes, it wouldn't be a Mediterranean restaurant unless you get a little attitude back for your stupid requests or questions so that's a plus here!

Were they out of a dish tonight on my first visit? Yes. Am I gonna leave a negative review? No! That's also a really good sign. It means they ran out of a dish they prepare by hand or take care to make it perfect for your enjoyment and if they're out that's fine, I'll check back next time.

Things are meant to be, I got stood up on my date and this place was her idea. So I got something good out of tonight, my new favorite Greek place!

You don't need to dress up, but don't come fresh from the gym either (like I did my first time), there's a more formal feel here from the white table cloths to the demeanor of the servers. 

Their standout is the grilled octopus appetizer, which I consider a must-get item despite the high price ($16) because it is so fresh and tender, comparable to Milos on the Strip. Their lunch specials include a pita sandwich (get the pork) for something hearty and several light salads if you're not too hungry. Some items, like their kolokythakia (fried zucchini) are only available on the dinner menu, so multiple visits may be necessary to try all the good stuff.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,31,22,4,51EmoR77arrMFVJYnzDiYg

The restaurant is very small, but the tables are nicely spaced so you can have a private conversation even if there is someone at the next table. Based on the rave reviews on Yelp, we started with the grilled octopus app. Great choice. We also shared the horiatiki salad. Lots of tomato, cucumbers, feta (really good feta!), and peppers in an oily dressing - delish!!! For my entree, I opted for a dish who's name had 16 letters in it (garidomakaronada). Alex was kind and tried to teach me how to pronounce it without any luck whatsoever. Basically translated to shrimp with pasta and red sauce. Outstanding dish. My wife went with a different dish that also had about 10 letters but translated to a more diverse seafood dish (lots of mussels and clams in addition to shrimp) over pasta with red sauce.

The food was good, not great (especially for the cost), but service is definitely lacking. 

While I understand smaller restaurants can't always accommodate seating requests, it's unacceptable to refuse one customer's request, then accommodate the very next customer behind you. 

We arrived on time for our reservation (which at first they weren't able to find). They seated us at a small table in front of the kitchen. We asked for another table and they said this was the only one available. But the couple behind us arrived 30 minutes early for their reservation and they were seated at a 4-top in the corner (we were both a party of 2). Huh? I thought there weren't any other tables available?? 

We sat for almost 10 minutes before a server came to take our order. 

To start, we ordered the scallops, octopus and zucchini. The zucchini was my favorite - fried, thinly sliced and served with tzatziki. For our entree, we split the seafood pasta (mussels, shrimp and scallops). Besides the zucchini, everything was good, but not special enough to make me want to come back.

Our experience started off rocky, but if the food blew me away, I'd give them a second chance. This was not the case.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,5,1,2,CfW2oNTsqWwiLXfV39jbhA

Which dish will I be coming back for? The GRILLED OCTOPUS!!! It was so tender, flavorful, and among best! This is a must for grilled octopus lovers! Portion wise, it made it a great value too!

My next favorite was their organic beets on a bed of horta (boiled greens seasoned with evoo and lemon juice) topped with garlic mashed potatoes. It was hearty, nutritious, good for the heart as well as your tummy! Another great value and a must if you like BEETS!

The BF enjoyed his grilled chicken pita sandwich, which came with a side of hand cut fried potatoes. He said the chicken was juicy and he loved the tzatziki sauce! I tried some of the fries and it was delicious. For their sandwiches, it can be served with both the hand cut fried potatoes AND a side of Greek salad for the price of $14 including the sandwich. Again, a great value.

We were super hungry so we ordered the full order of their Greek salad (Horiatiki). It was refreshing and a great finish to our meal. 

This is a casual restaurant with an upscale feel because of the white table cloths and cloth napkins vs paper napkins. Good for dates, business lunch or special occasions. They can accommodate large parties if you make reservations in advance. They are on open table and I was able to book a reservation on my mobile app.

Environment - does not look or feel Greek except for a few old movie  photos in dark frames on the wall. Window air conditioner is used to cool the very small( 12 tables) eating area . Yellow and green decor looks tired and dated . And to top it all off there is no bathroom on premise - you have to go outside and use the single co-ed stall - with no air conditioner - cooled with a fan - very much like a rural gas station .
Menus are brought out on clip boards - which could have been cute if they are nicer but these clipboards looked like they are from the dollar store 

Food was not bad but do not bother ordering appetizers - we had the skordalia and I am not joking there was less than a cup on the plate - they also low balled the serving for the salad and calamari which were both priced way too high for the amount .

My son and I had the gyros- and we are Greek - Greeks do not typically use pork in their gyros . My husband had skewered meat- again pork which is not the usual meat for a kabob . Tables also did not have salt and pepper or condiments on them . We would have had dessert but are heading out for some at another place instead as we are so disappointed with the value of our meal and the overall environment .

As people who really love Mediterranean food we were hoping this was going to be our new Greek place but it's won't be . we are sticking with the Greek Bistro in Henderson as our go to place for great Greek food and a much more reasonable  price outstanding service and better serving sizes .",xA3X1dy9kR1bDh4GZZEMrA,1,0,2,4p-Ysc3X0CREJaSzmD5tCA

By far the best octopus I've had in Vegas. Nice, tender, and a good flavor. Unfortunately the octopus is an appetizer, so it wasn't as much as I would have wanted. As for my main course meal, I went with the sea food spaghetti which consists of scallops, clams, and shrimp. Absolutely blew my mind how good the food was. Really high quality and great taste.  The only con is that the food is on the pricey side, so expect to spend a lot because the food is so good you'll want more. The serving sizes aren't the biggest either, but i managed to get full somehow. All that said, this is a really good place to enjoy some high quality Greek food.

The food was excellent, another level or two above the normal vin ordinare Greek restaurants in this town.  The Gyros is perfectly cooked pork (on the crispy side), not the smushed meat concoction you get at other Greek restaurants (which isn't really bad).  This is a level above for Gyros, accompanied by bread slices, great tzatzika sauce and seasoned fries.  The grilled octopus was similarly excellent, as was the salmon.  They do serve wine and beer and the Greek Chardonnay we had was very nice.  This is a small but very clean and well-appointed restaurant.  The vibe is quite European and the service was very good-attentive but not smothering.  It is nice to find a hidden jewel occasionally and Elia qualifies, having been open only 3 months.

The pita thick and hearty and fresh.  The rest of the pita sandwich was good and filling for the price of $8.  And being a formal Greek, restaurant, we were served some free bread and oil as an appetizer.  Really good bread - toasted and crispy - perfect for dipping.  I was hoping for a lunch special as other Yelpers had spoke about, but a fantastic pita sandwich for under $10 is definitely solid at a nice place like Elia.  

During lunch, there was literally no one else in the restaurant but us . The place is tiny already but felt even smaller with us as the only patrons.  Service was fine but he seemed a little annoyed at us ordering lunch food rather than entrees.  Weird part was the outside bathroom - clean, but not in the restaurant proper which is atypical for sure.  In and out in less than 45 minutes.

Things I had...

Tzatziki ($6)... tasty and refreshing yogurt with pieces of cucumber sauce. I ordered Tarama but Tzatziki came out. It's all good.

Grilled octopus ($16)... Must order this dish! So tender and not salty like the other Greek joints' grilled octopus. Small portion. Like someone here said, I could eat 10 orders of this dish. It was that good.

Souvlaki ($6 each)... Chicken and pork skewers. They were perfectly cooked. Moist and flavorful. Pork one was a little too fatty for me. 

Horiatiki ($16)... Large sharable salad. Simple tomato, cucumber, green pepper and onion salad. Feta cheese was good. 

Tsipoura ($29)... Whole grilled Daurade royale. Not many places offer this fish grilled. Tasted very fresh. Simple lemon EVOO and salt pepper seasoning but super rich flavor. 

Both waiters were so attentive and friendly. (From Greece)
The bathroom is located outside of the restaurant. Was not air conditioned when I went in. It was like 110 degrees inside, lol.

Make a Reservation!
They serve Greek beer & wine (YAY)!
It's Dee-Lish!!!!!

I am sooooo happy to finally have a great Greek restaurant that offers linen service and doesn't make you eat off plastic plates or out of tin foil circle pans!!!!

Service is familiarly phenomenal.  They treat you like you are a long-time friend of the family.    Responsive to every request (except ketchup for the hubs and I don't blame them for that....i woulda ignored that cray-cray request too!!)

Cannot say enough good things about the food.  Complimentary bread is grilled & crispy in all the right places.   Saganaki...simplistic & yummy!  We had the cabbage salad (could easily serve four) which was exactly as described uand exactly what i expected with a basic vinegar/EVOO ""dressing"".  I love cabbage so was happy, but if you aren't a cabbage lover, stick with the classic greek salad.  I had the grilled octopus appy as my entreé.  The octo was grilled to perfection with some char here & there and amazingly tender. It was a huge portion (especially compared to other restaurants) and shareable....unless you're me.  I shared exactly one tasty kibble and was selfish with the rest!!   Warning tho....if you don't like onions, stay away.   You could probably ask for it without them, but.......

Next came an order of horta, greens with EVOO, that was quite fresh though I could not tell you what greens were used.  My wife ordered what turned out to be the best farm raised salmon dish she has ever experienced.  My Colorado lamb chops were cooked to medium rare as requested and accompanied by lemon potatoes. The lamb had none of the funky flavor associated with Australian lamb and proved to be tender as could be.  Will we be back?

You begin with smoky grilled bread and Greek EVOO that is fantastic by itself or good to utilize with their many small plates.

Tarama ($6): Cured fish roe purée/dip
Grilled Octopus ($16)
Calamari ($12)
Roasted Feta ($10): Baked feta, tomato, serrano peppers
Kolokythakia ($12): Pan-fried Zucchini
Pork Souvlaki-Entree ($18)
Garidomakaronada ($25): Jumbo shrimp, spaghetti, tomato sauce

Seriously, everything is delicious. I'm just trying to make it through their menu! I recommend all the dishes I've had! The pasta was particularly outstanding and of course, the Grilled Mediterranean Octopus is a must. It's dressed with the usual EVOO, fresh red onion, and parsley, however, it's missing the beautiful capers. I'm assuming this is a preference of the chef or owners?

Their Pork Souvlaki is the BEST Pork Souvlaki I've had outside of Greece. The pork is really tender and the flavor is on point. The entree version is accompanied by grilled pita bread, Tzatziki, fresh tomato and red onion, and Greek fried potatoes. Everything is wonderful. The potatoes (Greece's version of fries) are the most true rendition of Greek fried potatoes in Vegas and they're so good!

This is already on my rotation of favorite restaurants! They also offer Lavraki (Mediterranean Seabass) at market price and I look forward to trying it as that was one of my favorite dishes to eat at Milos.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,11,8,5,8fAP5nescAZ_d1xPlbHhMg

As soon as we walked in, there really is no reception area.  We waited for a minute or so before a gentleman appeared and begrudgingly seated us.  There was no smiles or any kind of welcoming emotions throughout our time there.  

There were about another four tables of twos while we were there and there was only the man serving the entire restaurant.  The food was slow and ordinary and our drinks were empty at times.  But most importantly, we felt like an inconvenience to the server.  The icing on top was that this is not a economical meal.

I personally tried the octopus appetizer.   It tasted fresh, in a light EVOO  marinade.  For an entree I chose the gyro dinner.   It is not your traditional gyro meat; it reminded me more of shawarma as it is prepared fresh.  The meat was very tender not overly spicy.  What it lacks in space, it makes up for with delicious food.   Some may consider it a nice date spot.  While others might think it's not classy enough.  They use fabric tablecloths and put candles on the tables for dinner.   I would say go for the delicious food,  then decide from there.

Trusted Vegas Yeeps told me to check this place out.  Defectors of Vegas' most impressive Greek restaurant, Estiatirio Milos brought some of the restaurants great dishes here for all to enjoy.

Lunch features a wide assortment of outstanding starters including the incredible grilled octopus almost identical to that served at Milos for a fraction of the price, and an assortment of pita sandwiches and salads.  Dinner, replaces the sandwiches with a wide array of grilled proteins.

For starters, simple, get the grilled octopus. Extremely tender, a hint of bitterness from grilling, A generous pile along with slivered raw red onions is dressed in a peppery Greek olive oil, splashes of red wine vinegar.  Outstanding. Also, do not pass on the kolokythakia (pan fried zucchini with tzaiziki for smearing).  Another dish, straight from Milos, an ethereal thin, crisp batter surrounds finely sliced zucchini.  Oh so good. Other great starters include a great, tangy, blistered slab of uncrumbled feta over roasted tomatoes and Serano pepper's, and an uber flaky, an ungodly good saganaki (crisp fried molten block of kafalograviera cheese), and spanakopita (spinach and feta pie with cross made of flaky phyllo).

Standouts mains:  lavraki (whole grilled Mediterranean sea bass) and paidakia (grilled lamb chops). Both straightforward, no puff and fluff dishes.  The Seabass, perfectly grilled, aggressively seasoned, a drizzle of Greek olive oil and fresh lemon is all that's needed to round out the dish. The lamb chops, grill to temp, again, simply dressed with peppery olive oil and served with a side of lemon scented roasted potatoes.

Very nice selection of Greek wines.  Reasonable markup.

Service is very friendly, i.e. Greek taverna friendly.

Order a bottle or two of wine, enjoy some lamb, and always have the Windex at the ready!  Highly recommended.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,23,23,5,QHuEBC5Wq4D_D4OVKXDy-w

The ""Grilled Octopus"" was my primary reason for coming and it totally delivered!  The super tender, tentacles with the addition of EVOO, red onion and red wine vinegar was superb.  I made an oath around the 3rd bite to order it every single time I go here.    

""Roasted Feta"" featuring a block of oven baked cheese over tomato and hot serrano peppers arrived sizzling on a skillet and was a total cheesegasm.  I had no idea feta could be prepared like this as it was kind of like a tender, more robust paneer.  The pan fried zucchini known as ""Kolokythakia"" lived up to the Yelp hype; luxurious veggie chips with a cool, thick tzatziki yogurt dip were addictive as hell and all magically disappeared.  

There were many other starters we considered including the saganaki (fried cheese), calamari, and the mussels.  We almost opted for a six starter, no entrée meal, but so glad we didn't!  That's because missing out on sharing the whole grilled seabass would have been a goddamn shame.  Wonderfully grilled, simply seasoned and then drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice let that beautiful fishy flesh shine; fantastic for $30!  Yet another solid spot in SW Vegas!!!!!

First visit was on weekdays lunch. Second time was weekend. Their food was good, their atmosphere is okay. 

One of popular menu Grill octopus taste was amazing at the first time, but the second time was salty and taste was not same as first time.

On my first time, I FOUND A HAIR ON MY DISH. I don't remember exactly food name, it was kind of wrap sandwiches. I wore the cap that time and I found it on my last bite. I told our server, Of course they can't charge me this kind of shitty food but I can understand sometimes they can do a mistake. So I just want to let them know about some hair was on my food and said generously. However the server didn't apologized to us and just said their cooker doesn't have any hair. I felt so uncomfortable to call other server, and he tried to give that food for free. i rejected their offer and they gave us 2 deserts on the house. But it was not tasty and I left more tips for the deserts cost.

On my second time was on weekend late afternoon. The last time wasn't good experiences but I want their octopus. Weekend food menu was over price, and waiting time after we order was so long. Even our table seat first but we got an appetizer after later table. Also we got the main at the same time with appetizer and the sever told us this food supposed to be go other table(later one after we seat) Until this it was okay, the octopus was salty and not taste same as last time. My gyros plates was served with small amount yogurt sauce and I asked them is it possible to get more this sauce when I left 1/3 amount of food. They gave us some big portion of sauce(almost 4 times amount as on my dish) and they CHARGED ME $7. If they want to serve the exactly same portion that on the menu, they should let customer know about there's an extra charge!

Overall my experience

Their try to run a homemade greek food, taste was okay but over price over all.
Around 10-12 small pieces octopus legs, onions and olive oil is $16. Their wine is $12 per glass, it was not that differences with other wines that you can get $7 wine per glass on other restaurant.
Their attitude was not bad but they need to learn more how to care the customer.
