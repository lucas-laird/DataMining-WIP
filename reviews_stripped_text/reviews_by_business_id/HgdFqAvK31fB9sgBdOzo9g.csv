11008,2016-08-09,1,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Good food, but their customer service is less than professional.  I walked in with a friend for brunch.  I stood in line to order and she went to sit at a table.  There was a guy ""policing"" the seating and told her that she couldn't sit down until we had ordered our food.  There were 3 parties in front of me, so he made her stand to the side of the counter in the hallway leading to the bathrooms.  Seriously???  So we turned around and left.

So we gave the business a second chance since, like I said, their food is good.  We arrived at the restaurant at 2:45p.  When we got to the counter, the lady/owner said they close at 3:00p, so we would have to eat outside while they close up the restaurant.  I reminded her that it was only 2:45p and she said they start closing at 2:45p so they can be out of the restaurant by 3:00p.  Again, seriously???  (Mind you, under normal circumstances, I wouldn't mind eating outside, but in Vegas in July/August, no one wants to be outside more than they have to be).

We will no longer be going back to give our business, based solely on their lack of customer service.  I can honestly say that I've never come across a small business that cares so little about  customer business/service.",TedS4QG2aj5BCAQ-LOIiCA,4,2,2,ebvE28UStAvwMX1h4EUu6w

My first time I had the Greek, probably my favorite now. Huge crepe filled with chicken, ricotta cheese, olives and other stuff. It filled me up.  
Definitely have to have their mimosas because some of the flavors are fresh squized juices. My favorite is definitely blood orange mimosa. 
Second time I had veggie crepe. It is smaller serving and tasted just ok. Probably wont order that again.

There could be a wait to be seated and maybe a little longer for your order but they haven't disappointed yet. Order ahead, take it to go, but for mimosas you have to stay.

127456,2013-01-20,5,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"This was a bad idea. Shame on you people for leaving such glowing reviews to this totally ordinary place. 

Plus: The sweet crepes were made with fresh fruit, whipped cream on the side. The dough was thin and fluffy. The savory little Italy one had watery marinara sauce inside the dough (surprising). 

Minus: No taste to speak of. There was the dough on one hand, the cream on the other, etc... Just like having them next to one another on the plate. The little Italy was difficult to pick up due to watery composition. 

Service: there was a waiting list (10 minutes). However the older customer manager guy forgot to mention that the outside area was open too (nobody was sitting there) so we waited in the cramped place by the restroom for a table to open. We were in a hurry and don't like drafty noisy dark places - minus one point. We ordered 5 crepes (4 sweet, 1 savory) and we got only 4. Again, hurry so we did not have time to order/have made another. Minus one point. Ordinary food - minus one point. 

This place might be at the top of the list for the Henderson customers (friends or relatives of owner?) but it's a total waste of time for anyone else.

128771,2014-08-28,1,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. 

Not only is it overrated, but over priced and run by the most rude people. 

My first mistake was going on a Saturday. My girlfriend say the overwhelming, yet over zealous, reviews on Yelp and wanted to go. Upon entering we realized they were packed! We waited in line for a while with a family behind us that we made small talk with. We got to the counter and that's when it started, our horrible experience. It's a Crepe place, right? Well, anyone who has had crepes before knows they are not very filling. Seeing their menu, I was confused as to whether or not they had a full crepe meal. Second mistake: asking the owner/chef a question.

 The owner was running the cash register when we went to place our order and I asked a simple question: ""Do the crepes come in a meal?"" Seems like a simple question to which there should be a simple answer, nope. The reply I got was ""I don't understand your question. I have stuffed crepes..."" So I asked again, this time I explained myself. I wanted a meal, with eggs, bacon, hashbrowns...something other than one, thin crepe. The reply I got was much worse the second time around. He asked, "" What does it say on the menu? Read it to me."" And that's when my jaw hit the floor. Did this a**hole just ask me if I could read?! Did he just insult me for entering his establishment?! Am I going to jail for putting this mans face on a hot skillet?! 

In disbelief, I ordered a number one and did not walk out like I wanted to. My girlfriend wanted to stay and continue our nice (until now) Saturday. We ordered two crepes and a mimosa flight. The bill came to over thirty dollars! I not only paid for NOTHING but paid to be insulted. Then it took 45 minutes to get our food. The meal was only two crepes and watered down mimosa's. We were hungry within an hour after eating and pissed that we had to wait so long.  Not worth it. The family that had ordered behind us were still waiting for their food when we left. 

This place might be trendy, and have neat decor, but it's small, doesn't have A/C (IN VEGAS!!), and is very over priced. Don't bother.",AWgQDSkqB2rQTcfBxKChtA,5,0,1,_zZVPxwopICu3ZkdfgdPTg

146189,2012-03-04,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"""They're just really thin pancakes."" No, they're not. This place takes crepes to a whole new level. 

Going in first thing to hit me was the decor. Everything works together. If this place wasn't done by a pro interior designer, then the owners have a promising backup career in case the whole crepe thing doesn't pan out (knock on wood!). Everything's black and white with pink/fuchsia (sorry I dunno my colors, I never got those huge crayon sets as a kid). It's super classy and cute. They also have two tvs on the food network, and another smaller one hooked up to a camera above the cooking area so you can watch your crepe being made. 

I shared half a Sonora crepe and half a Greek crepe. The crepes themselves were perfectly done, thin and light and almost melt in your mouth. I think I liked the Sonora better, it was super savory and filled with carne asada, smooth guacamole and gooey jack cheese. The Greek was literally a Greek chicken salad in a crepe. It was super fresh from the spinach and tomatoes, with a nice saltiness from the feta. I was stuffed and decided to pass on a sweet dessert crepe today.

For my drink I got a white peach mimosa. The sampler trio is super duper popular, but I've had it enough times to know which flavor is my fave. They also have a ton of fancy sodas that I've never heard of. I'm tempted to try the ginger beer, but the mimosas are just too good to pass up. The mimosa was served in a neat flute glass and was sweet without being too sweet.

It's all the little things, all the attention to detail that shows in the decor/crepes/drinks  that gives this place five stars in my book.",kYAZadWY7QXGtzo648VUOA,0,0,5,Erg2ETO8Th4wW9FHNtWUmg

They make me feel like family coming over for lunch/ brunch. if you want a damn good crepe this is the place . This place is only open in the am and usually packed on the weekends.

Now I have read the reviews online  and I will say the  putting my name on a list and standing while waiting for a table does not bother me at all.

Anyway, on the last day we finally found this Gem.

Their selection was great; everything looked delicious, we couldn't decide. We decided to add strawberries to the Monkey crepe, and leave out the Chicken in a different crepe. When we asked the waitress/clerk if these alterations were possible, she laughed it off and said Of Course! She immediately offered to substitute two other ingredients into the crepe because we took out the chicken. Let me say that again; in exchange for removing an ingredient, she offered completely on her own (as if it was a no-brainer) to add TWO additional ingredients to make up for the loss. I guess with these people, take away one, add two, for free. Sweet!!!!

The crepes were fabulous. Delicioso! The cooked them from scratch, and it was quick.

So at this place, you order your food at the counter, take a seat and they bring out your food. Since they were so busy and had no available seating, the man suggested that we wait to order our food until we had a table, which makes sense. We were offered two spots at their largest table where we would share the table with other customers, but we passed up on that. We waited about 10 minutes until we had our table and ordered.

It was Saturday and it was crowded. On entering the cafe we were drawn to the counter by the owner who said ""Come on in!""  I must admit first timers suffer a bit of confusion on seating, ordering and being relegated to a narrow hall to wait for your name to be called. We had some trepidation on how long this process was going to take but it was perhaps 15-20 minutes and we were called. By then we had ample time to look over the menus given us on arrival and were seated at a decent sized table. The crepes were exceptional and they didn't take that long to arrive. We ordered the Rosarito and the William Tell along with the Mimosa sampler. We shared them and couldn't decide which we liked more although one was spicy and one sweet.  I've gotta say this is a hard place to bring little kids.  It's crowded, some of the seats are high and it's just too loud to be a family type dining experience.  The cafe is small and the noise level is a distraction but you get used to it.  We were so amazed at how good the food was we were planning our return before we left.  Prepare yourself to be patient and wait if coming on the weekend but it's worth it.  BRAVO! they do crepes.....and only crepes right.",C_UHThhNaZgU1b7pfGn0eg,0,0,5,V9n868lwKw75v03GFJvE5g

My brother had regaled me for years with stories of delicious crêpe carts on every corner as far as the eye could see. But alas it was not so. Out of maybe 6 or 7 places we stopped at, only one was worth coming back to, and when I did return (the next day actually) they were closed. ""Seriously?! On a Sunday?!""

I came home utterly devastated. More so in commiseration with my wife, an avid crêpe connoisseur,  for whom the word ""crêpes"" had been number three on her list of reasons we needed to see Paris. 

I would never have imagined that we had a place that served Crêpes, better than any we had on our travels, and that it was right down the street at Crêpe Expectations.  

I recommend you try one savory and one sweet, like the berry crêpe with lemon custard along with the egg and bacon crêpe. I forget the names. Also, since it's cold out, I believe you can sub a soup for one of the side orders. I didn't see it on the menu and there might be an additional cost, but I saw a few people order it and their reaction seemed favorable. Also, while your at it, treat yourself to a flight of mimosas, a sampler of three glasses of champagne with fruit juice. As I recall, the Pineapple mimosa was my favorite of the three I last ordered. 

( I could not help myself from writing this review as if I were some kind of fancy gentlemen. But honestly this place is good tasting, high quality food, and they work hard to provide the best service they can, despite the high volume and small space.

I often take my daughter here to have brunch & every time we come in I'm truly amazed at how Lou greets every customer as if they're the first customer to come in & it's his first day opened with his brand new sparkling business! Often if you go to a business and its towards the end of the shift you will get this almost robotic insincere greeting but with Lou that just doesn't exist. You could come in 5 min till close & Lou will greet you as if it's 5 min after open!  I really wish I could give this place infinity stars because that's what they deserve! Each and every staff member is so positive and full of the greatest energy. A happy staff makes for happy customers. I always take the time to observe how the staff treats not only the customers but each other from the owners to the dish washers they are really a team effort & I couldn't be happier with the service they provide me each time I come in.

708663,2015-03-12,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"There are seemingly two kinds of crepes that you can get.  The first is the kind that comes from the Crepe Shack - these are acceptable, in as much as they are packed to the gills with sugar (so of course they taste good) and not much else.  The consistency is bland and you will be hungry 30 minutes later.  The second kind of crepe is what you can expect at Crepe Expectations.  It's a perfect texture with fresh, filling ingredients.

To get the negatives out of the way: this place is super cramped and always busy.  It can get  crowded and confusing if you've never been.  Often times you will be helped by an awesomely nice gentleman who will secure you a seat while you go wait in line and order your food.  This is not a full service kind of restaurant - if you want to be waited on hand and foot, go elsewhere. There are servers will who bring you your food and ask you if you need anything else and that's about it.  It's very close quarters eating.  We always end up sitting at the family style table right in the middle and have very little issues with it.

On to the excellence: the food is incredible!  The crepes are cooked to perfection and the flavor is out of this world.  We've had The Monterey, The Crepelet, and the Ana Bananas Foster, among others, and they all were delicious.  Portion sizes are perfect.  You don't leave hungry and even have enough leftover for a little snack later.  The menu is varied and there's no shock value with the pricing.  The cucumber and lemon waters are a nice way to complement your meal.

While looking on Yelp for breakfast eateries today my wife found Crepe Expectations.  Wow! What a great little place this is!  The owners did a terrific job with decor.  This is a very intimate spot with half booths on one side and high top tables on the other.  Coffee and water are self serve from the small beverage bar, I didn't mind as it is a very short walk to refill.  There was no self serve soda fountain, I assume that was behind the counter someplace, didn't bother me in the least.  There are also a few tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining as well.  Back to the interior, there was a large TV in the dining area showing the Food Channel.  I don't know if that is standard or just for today.  By far the more interesting TV was the smaller one over the register displaying an overhead shot of the chef making your crepe!  Very novel idea!  Now, down to what you all want to know....the food.  Full of flavor, it had a very fresh taste as though it was all organic food, no preservatives.  I don't know if this was the case but it sure tasted that way.  The portion looked small but the crepe was packed, I was pleasantly filled with my breakfast crepe.  On the side we had a choice of cottage cheese or sliced bananas.  While not a fan of cottage cheese, I took the banana....again, I enjoyed this part of the meal even though I didn't think much of it at the time.  Overall, Crepe Expectations exceeded all of my expectations.  We are going back later this afternoon for a dessert crepe...maybe I will do an update.  One last thing, the hours are very limited...they close at 3 pm so  don't plan on coming in for a late dessert.  A great place to eat and I am looking forward to my next visit.

Arrived at 9, quickly got a seat and checked out the menu.  We shared a savory crepe (egg, sausage), followed by a sweet (Nutella, Strawberries, Bananas).  Both were Gluten Free, and both were amazing.  Talked to the owner a bit, mainly about the bucket of Nutella they used - and she told us about how Nutella will soon be distributing their magic chocolate elixer in piping bags (in addition to jars).

The food and ambiance were so good, we went back the next day.  Got there around 10, and it was packed - we were lucky to find two available seats.  By the time we finished, there were about 12 people in line waiting for a seat.  On this trip, I had the Elvis - Bacon, Peanut Butter, Caramel, and Banana.  Yum!

For those that are gluten intolerant:  They really, really, *really* try to keep their gluten free food gluten free, and you can watch every step of the process.  However, the woman running the gluten-free bakery next door who's Celiac said that they aren't perfect, and she can't eat here.  I suspect it depends on how much gluten you can withstand - odds are, there's very, very little included, but this place wouldn't be certified gluten-free.

The food is AMAZING.  I love the Rosarito, which has delicious chorizo and homemade guacamole.  I'm also a fan of the Grand Turk, which also incorporates the guac.  Most recently I tried the Bomber, and was impressed with the flavor of the meatball.  It's got some good kick!  Ana has some serious culinary talent!  I recommend going with a friend, as I can't eat a whole savory crepe and have a dessert crepe too, and it is a shame to miss out on the dessert crepes.  When I went with a friend we shared the Frisco, and it was out of this world!  The lemon curd is perfection.  I can tell the ingredients are quality, it really makes for an amazing product. 

I should also mention, the staff is very friendly.  They truly appreciate your business.  The decor is beautiful (check out the bathrooms, very pretty) and I enjoy lingering after my meal with a nice cup of coffee.   There's a nice patio seating area, which is great for people watching on the weekends.  You get a very nice dining experience, and the price is not hard on your wallet either.

859672,2018-01-07,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Crepe was tasty but the restaurant is not a place to dine alone. 

I love crepes and this morning I was in the mood for some - *both* savory and sweet. I went here b/c of the good reviews and it started out pleasant enough... A gentleman was standing outside and welcomed me in as he took me to my table, a nice corner table by the door which I said to him was ""perfect."" (I have a sensitivity condition so generally when I go out to eat, I prefer sitting away from the bustle of people). As soon as I started to sit in my chair, he changed his tune and asked me to sit in a middle table at the banquet wall on the other side of the room. Mind you, he was the one who took me to the original corner table so it was extremely disappointing to have him change his mind as I was sitting down. I don't like banquet seating - and especially not being squished between other tables so when he asked me to switch tables I decided to just take something home rather than put myself in an uncomfortable situation. 

I went to the counter to place my order (a sweet crepe with pears, goat cheese and honey which had quite a decent amount of filling) but as I was standing watching the chef's create the crepes, they asked if I wanted to sit in the side corridor while I wait. It was a long, dark corridor where I'd just be staring at a dark wall three feet in front of me. Not interested!

I travel for business all around the world, and have MANY relatives in Paris, so I appreciate a good crepe when I can find one. I also find that the true test of a good restaurant is how well they treat me when I'm dining alone. Do they give me the same quality of service and attentiveness as with larger tables or do they ignore me and/or treat me different b/c they think one person will not spend as much as a larger table. I was quite hungry and had planned to eat two crepes in addition to libations but the disappointing treatment made me shorten my order and my visit. Their loss. I actually thought the crepe was quite tasty and the person who gave it to me put a dollop of whip cream in a separate container without my having to ask - so that the heat of the crepe wouldn't melt the whipped cream.

What's even more disappointing is that the person seating people put a couple at the table I was originally going to sit at - two people who could have just as easily sat at the second table he wanted to move me to... Next time I'll find somewhere else to enjoy a crepe.",-9R1ETuc2CBaxRP4zg2iUw,1,0,2,FzBctm3jyLAcM0ymdIpByA

926252,2011-06-09,1,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"I love crepes. And surprisingly, this city is lacking in the crepe department. The only place I knew of was the little window in the Paris hotel. I am glad to see a few more crepe establishments open up, and I am even more glad to give them a try.

One of those new places is Crepe Expectations. I had great expectations for Crepe Expectations (ha-ha). And overall, I'd say they met most of them. The decor of the restaurant is nice and modern and the outdoor furniture is pretty comfy. There is even a flat screen above the counter that displays an overhead view of your crepe being made!

I hit up this place with a friend. Here's what we had:

-the Greek - a crepe filled with the typical greek items such as feta cheese and olives. The grilled chicken was a little dry and tough, but other than that, the rest of the crepe was delicious.
-the Caprese - the classic salad wrapped in a crepe. The pesto sauce on top was a nice touch.
-the Mimosa Trio Sampler- you get to choose from 5 flavors: classic orange, lychee, passion fruit, pomegranate and white peach. The lychee and the white peach were my favorites.

Today, the special was a chocolate covered strawberry with the mimosa trio sampler for $2 more. The one crepe and the mimosa sampler brought my total to a little over $20, which I thought was pretty pricy. I guess that's what happens when you add a little bubbly. But if you go and get just a crepe, they are reasonalbly priced anywhere from $5-$10, depending on how fancy you wanna get.

Crepe Expectations has a large variety of breakfast, savory and sweet crepes in addition to beer, wine, bubbly, coffee and tea. I can't wait to go back and try some more, especially the banana nutella crepe I was eying this morning.",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,3,2,4,B0DF4zom7x5jWnqd9s9i9g

Inside, it was a little cramped, which is why it's hard to get a reservation. However, there happened to be a table opened, so we got there by a good chance.

To order, the customer must go up to the cashier like at a traditional café, and then the employee gives you a number and then you sit down. The wait for us was decent, not long, but not short either. (About 15 minutes)

The crêpes itself are worth the wait, though. They're huge and can easily be taken to go as well. They offer many options, savory, sweet, and breakfast. I usually have my crêpes with their jasmine tea and honey. It's such a refreshing treat to have any time of the day!

It's clear that every detail is addressed, from the way the owner talks with customers about where they'd prefer to sit (and then chats about their favorite items!), to the little bowl of sea salt hand scrub in the bathroom, to the cucumber- and lemon-flavored water. The crepes themselves remind me of the ones in France- very light, fluffy, slightly crispy at the edges, buttery, absolute perfection. I usually order the Caprese (tomato, mozzarella (the good kind), homemade pesto, and you can add chicken which I do), and then share a sweet crepe, like the Nutella with bananas and hazelnuts. The whipped cream must be homemade because it tastes incredibly fresh, light and fluffy, and isn't overly sweet or artificial-tasting. The iced tea sometimes takes a few extra minutes to come out, but it is worth it for a delicious cup of fresh-brewed tea poured over ice! The service isn't SUPER fast as this isn't a huge chain, everything is made fresh when you order it, and it is definitely a popular place, but it is prompt, efficient, and always friendly.

They started breaking down at 2:30, carried away the self-serve drinks, swept, closed out the till and set chairs on tables well in advance of 3 pm.  Then at 3:08 pm asked us to leave.  So basically, this place should state their hours are until 2 or 2:30, but not 3 pm. We arrived before 2 pm, expecting to have a little over an hour for our meal - we did not expect to be promptly asked to leave at 3 pm.  Both good food and good service are necessary for a thriving restaurant business.  If you don't love it, don't do it.  And if you want to close up early and ask customers to leave,  perhaps you should build ejection seats into the chairs so you can get rid of those pesky customers finishing up their meal as soon as possible.",piF8b360S3g5oCX0kOSYjQ,1,0,3,r2po4sDpnm9lsJ9IYT2uZg

My friend had the William Tell with apples, caramel and whipped cream. The apples were hard and the caramel flavorless. Besides the food being just ok, the host was so rude I would never go back. 
We walked in and he asked how many and sat us at a table. We were waiting on a third friend and had told him there were 3 of us. We hadn't been there more than 3-4 minutes when he told us if we didn't order right away we would have to give up our table!! I'm not sure why he sat us since he knew our friend wasn't there yet if that's how they operate. We were told there were people waiting. (I'm still not sure why their money is better than mine) However, there were 2 open tables. We did as we were told and quickly ordered and left our friend to fend for herself. She came before we finished ordering and added her order. I've never felt so poorly treated in my life. I felt they were doing me a favor by serving me a meal I was paying for. This is a strip mall, not NYC. It's a restaurant. for dining. This would be a place to visit on the way to the airport or when you are in a rush, not a place you would like to enjoy your meal and have a conversation with friends. I felt like at anytime my plate was going to be taken from me-Lucille Ball style-and I was going to be sent out the door! (Times up, get out!) I guess we didn't understand the ""rules"".

The atmosphere and decor are pretty depressing, tired looking and in need of some interior design. We ended up eating outside and it was fine until I tried to refill my coffee. The sliding door didn't work and I had to walk around the tables to get back in. Also, the table where the coffee is set on is way in the back where people hover, and I had to walk around tables again just to return outside. Bad planning. 

The crepe itself was pretty good but nothing to speak of. I ate The Frisco. My first thought after my food arrived was ""that's it?""  One measly crepe for $7.50+tax. I could have easily eaten 2 more. The filling was just blueberries. I was expecting them to be prepared a little bit more elaborately, like a compote or some sauce. 

Lastly the bathroom. The women's was fine but my husband said the men's was filthy, comparable to a gas station bathroom that hadn't been cleaned in a year.  

After eating here I wished I would have had the crepes at Paris hotel's buffet instead.",K0GGrlVclaoKS_CG8uCPrg,1,0,2,vy3q-YRNKloS0wAUJildtA

The seating is weird. If you go on the weekend when it would busy, you have to go to the counter and let them know how many people you have, and they won't take your order until you're seated, which has its pros and cons. 

The owner is usually working the register and he's awesome - he'll make great recommendations based on what you like or are in the mood for and he's really personable.

Only four stars because when it's busy, it's a bit of a long wait. That being said, DEFINITELY worth it!",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,1,1,4,kDWzZCXqBQ5V9BFJTJdcbw

My husband's crepe was soo delicious! We both loved it! Mine was good too but lacked a bit in flavor. I kinda wished I the one my husband got, lol. He also got the watermelon juice and loved it! I got the mango mimosa which was also delicious but I thought it was going to have juice in it with the champagne. It was more of a champagne with mango flavor.

The staff is extremely friendly and very attentive to every customer. The owner actually works the cash register and if you can't decide from the many excellent choices, he'll offer a suggestion.  

As for food, I've tried a few and loved them all. For the savory crepes, I've tried the Sonora, the Caprese, and one of their specials, I believe it's called the Clucker. The Sonora is like a Mexican burrito, with a crepe instead of the tortilla. When I said that, the owner responded with, ""Yeah, like a burrito, but better"" and I totally agree. The meat and guacamole were well seasoned and the meat was still very tender. The Caprese was also very good, I loved the pesto! The Clucker was filled with chicken, chorizo, and some cheese and it was super flavorful. The chorizo gave a nice little kick and the chicken was still very moist. All of them were packed full, you definitely get your money's worth, in quality and quantity. 

The one sweet crepe I tried was the Frisco and it was mm mm tasty. The lemon curd was not too sweet or too sour and there was just the perfect amount of it, not overpowering the crepe or the blueberries. Also, that bad boy was FILLED with blueberries. There had to have been at least an entire 4oz package of blueberries in that thing!

Each of the savory crepes came with a side of soup or salad, although the Clucker, since it was considered a breakfast crepe had the choice of banana too. When I first ordered, I asked for the banana, but quickly changed my mind wanting the salad, and the owner said he would just tell the staff. When my food came, it came with the banana and I said I changed it to a salad. The waiter just threw in the salad on top of the banana! Seriously, really great service here. 

I can't wait to come back and try more of the crepes, if only they were open a little later. Not a big morning person, but I will make the effort to wake up earlier for this place, and so should you!",-LEJFq5RC0rQAG831uYRKg,2,2,5,NnxJ1V2_4hAqraGqHoC-yQ

When we finally got up to order the gentleman at the register took a whole order without even saying excuse me or anything. We had been waiting for a couple minutes and the phone rang and was first in line before us. As I looked around the place just looked like it hasn't had a deep cleaning in months. Walls have splatter, trash on the ground, stains on the ground, just dirty. After placing my order I went to the restroom. The restroom was just as bad if not worse than a gas station restroom .. my guess is it probably hasn't been cleaned in months ! There were what could possibly be pee stains on the floor, trash on the floor, stains on the walls. In short I was completely disgusted. After my bathroom experience I walked and noticed the door to the kitchen open, trust me I understand it can be hard to keep a kitchen clean but it was the same as the bathroom. I saw a collection of dirty towels in a basket (and I believe these are the towels they use to wipe up the crepe mix from order to order) but it made me wonder on the cleanliness of these towels. As I'm sitting there waiting for my food (which by this point I was thinking I might not eat) I look over and see one of the ""chefs"" wiping his sweat off  his head with a napkin for quite a while as he talked to some customers sitting in the crepe bar area. I continued to see if he would go and wash his hands after but he didn't and proceeded in serving plates and bringing plates out to other customers.

The Avalon was my personal favorite. I felt that it was a great blend of sweet and slightly tangy with the pear, walnut, and goat cheese combo.  

I expected the crepes to be small, but they were actually very filling! I think the part of the dining experience that impressed me the most was when we left the restaurant. The host actually remembered our names after only meeting us once! Made it feel like we'd been there forever even though it was only our first time.

I always add turkey and I highly recommend it! For a sweet crepe, I'm addicted to ""The Avalon"". This one has pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey. They offer different fun flavors of mimosas and you can order a trio to taste a few. The coffee is excellent! I always get a White Mocha and in the warmer months get it iced. Yum yum yum!

I chose The Greek ($8.50) with a side of fideo soup, The Avalon ($7.75) with a side of cottage cheese, and an order of Guava juice ($2.50). The Greek is a savory crêpe which has grilled chicken, spinach, feta cheese, tzatziki yogurt, kalamata olives, red onion, and tomato. The Avalon is a sweet crêpe which has buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and honey. For The Avalon I did ask for peanut butter filling and was charge an extra 50 cents, but when I receive the crêpe there isn't any peanut butter. I had to reach out for caramel sauce just to sweeten it and add more flavor. Both crêpes are good but it's not something I would enjoy as a daily meal. I'm more of a soft and fluffy pancake type. The fideo soup and guava juice are probably the only two items I like the best. Overall the service is friendly, I like that the server is attentive.

It's located in an unassuming, newer shopping center with an eclectic mix of restaurants, offices and stores.

The staff we encountered all provided prompt an friendly service.  
Now for the crepes...  In theory I like savory crepes, but I never seem to be able to pass up the sweet ones, so I ordered The Frisco with flavorful blueberries, lemon curd, fresh whipped cream (NOT from a can) and powdered sugar. The crepe itself was light, thin & perfectly cooked. The lemon curd & plump blueberries were divine!  
My 'savory' husband ordered The Little Italy with pepperoni, mozzarella & a tomato-basil sauce. It also came with choice of soup or mixed greens salad. He went with the soup and it was all very tasty. For drinks we just opted for the complimentary cucumber and lemon waters which were very refreshing , especially when mixed together.

We got to Crepe Expectations on Saturday morning, so of course we were expecting it to be busy! There was a line out of the door. The restaurant is set up where you order your food, then (if available) find a seat. There were no open seats, however we didn't want to place an order to go. There was a waiter going through the line asking who was placing to go orders and who was wanting to eat there. I informed him we wanted to eat there, so he told us to get out of the line and wait. We waited for around ten minutes, then he came back and told us to get back in line? It was very confusing. I noticed he had done this with a couple other people as well. After we ordered we were told to wait again for an open table. Unfortunately it was cold outside so we didn't want to take an open table outside. After fifteen minutes we got seated, and we were seated right by the kitchen. Right next to our table was a drip coffee section, people who ordered drip were advised to come ask for a cup and get their own coffee. I noticed everyone who was trying to get their coffee were very confused as to what they need to be doing. They would try to get someone from the kitchen's attention, but everyone in the kitchen were so busy that no one was available to get the customer's cups. 

We got our food, and it was great! I do understand why everyone raves about the food. We got a couple crepes that looked great and were enjoyable to eat. It was also neat to see the chefs making your crepes! However, it was not worth the unorganized trouble that we went through. 

This restaurant would benefit from changes that need to be made! It looks like they recently changed locations, so maybe what they were doing worked for them at their previous location, but with the current location and set up of the building what they are doing definitely doesn't work. The main suggestion I have is setting the drip coffee station at the front and the person taking their order gives them a mug and directs them to the drip station right next to them. Another suggestion I have is to possibly allow people to sit down before taking orders, if they are staying and not placing an order to go. The order process was very confusing and even the waiter trying to keep it organized was all over the place! With a few adjustments, I could definitely see myself enjoying my experience here more.",mu4XvWvJOb3XpG1C_CHCWA,4,2,3,tPKmlii9e5n6V167W-8uYQ

I'm not a big crepe eater but I always seem to love them. I am especially fond of sweet crepes with fresh fruits inside and whip-cream on top.

Visited this place on a whim since I was staying close by in Henderson at the Green Valley Ranch.  

Ordered a lunch crepe with turkey and avocado and a dessert crepe with lots of berries and an extra side of bananas.  

Everything was delicious and I will definitely come here again! I'm giving them five stars because BOTH of the crepes were outstanding and that usually doesn't happen.  Usually one crepe is better than the other but both of these crepes were delicious and fulfilling!

What's more is I appreciate good service and friendliness from the staff, and I have to say that I felt right at home at this place. Lou, the owner, came over and asked us how everything was and made sure we were enjoying the food.

Aside from the food, it's a nice eatery. The decor was nice. The only downside, and the reason it lost a star from me, was the fact that they are not open during hours that normal working people would be able to enjoy the food.

Since we said no, the waitress explained that we could order at the counter, seat ourselves, and the dishes would be brought out to us. She was very friendly!

We ordered the Rosarito (chorizo, scrambled egg, cheese, and guacamole) and Berry Delight (strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries). The Rosarito came with a side of bananas or cottage cheese, which wasn't listed on the menu, so I was a bit unprepared to make a choice at the register since I was sharing it. Anyway, I ordered the cottage cheese to go with my crepe. The sweet crepe didn't come with any side. You do have an option of adding on potatoes, but I figured the portions might be too big to finish if I ordered it.

My first impression of the crepes was that it was huge, so come hungry! The Rosarito crepe was okay. I picked this because it seemed to have a bit more fillings than some of the other offerings under the breakfast crepes. The chorizo was about dry, and tasted like ground beef to me. I didn't notice the egg in his crepe too much and only really noticed the other ingredients, especially the chorizo. They gave a fair amount of guacamole so that was cool, but it wasn't really seasoned, and seemed like it was just smashed avocado. The Berry Delight was also just okay. I liked that they gave a lot of fresh berries and didn't skimp, but the strawberries were a bit sour, and for that, I wished there was more whipped cream on the side or powdered sugar. I'd probably opt to get a sweet crepe that has a bit of a filling (think other crepes with goat cheese or Nutella) than just fruit inside. If you want to try multiple crepes and are in the company of friends/family, I recommend splitting up different crepes to sample. Basically I had my main savory crepe and my dessert crepe!

Overall, the crepes were fair, I wasn't super impressed to make another trip back out. However the service was good, and this place seems pretty popular even on the weekdays.",2KJ5BExMxBhcZUwZVGHrWg,1,2,3,crIrtGnrJ-xjIACOIq6Tjg

My husband and I were both in the mood for some fresh delicious crepes and had zero desire to walk to the Paris hotel and casino. I looked up crepes on Yelp and was really impressed with the 4.5 star rating. 

This is an adorable little place nestled in a strip center with a ton of other restaurants. They have a nice little seating area outside, the interior isn't too big. We ordered the Monterrey breakfast crepe with bacon, eggs, peppers, cheese and chilies, the Crepelete with Swiss, eggs and thick smoked ham and the Monkey with Nutella, sliced bananas, whip cream and chocolate drizzle. Each crepe was totally different and delicious. They were generous with the fillings and  given a healthy dose of cheese. The Monkey was super good and went perfectly with the other crepes and my coffee. They have a camera over the crepe griddles so you can see them make each order. The eggs are even made to order, no scoop out of a warmer here. 

They offer fresh cucumber and lemon water to drink along with a variety of mimosas, beers, soft drinks and coffee. There is even a mimosa flight! 

I highly recommend this place! Even more so because you are getting quality food without the Strip price tag. Totally worth the drive and you get to see another side of Vegas while you are at it.",-24B_nkBG6Et1_QJecnN2A,2,0,5,muv0cNwbBxWEqcKAbUbyQg

1528913,2012-05-09,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"From the moment we walked into Crepe Expectations, I began composing a raving review in my head for yelp. As you enter, you are greeted by chalkboards announcing beverages of all kinds - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, from the usual to the unique. For example, if you're  a cream soda or root beer fan, don't miss ZeiberFizz, a combination of creamy soda and mild root beer flavor. Chimay for cheaper than they sell it at the bars in my hometown was quite attractive as well. As a mimosa fan, I should also note they have five flavors of mimosas, and for the indecisive, a mimosa trio sampler for $10.

Of course, you don't come here for the beverages, you come here for the crepes. Ahhh the crepes. Divided into an organization freak's dream, with categories for sweet, savory, or breakfast. Being that we were going out for the first meal of our day, we tried the Crepelet, the Sunday Morning, and the Berry Bliss. As strawberries aren't currently in season, I didn't mind that the strawberries were average, because everything else was absolutely amazing. You can watch the crepes being made on closed circuit television just above the ordering station. Everyone who knows crepes knows that if you can't see the pan through the dough, the crepe is too thick. The good news here is that the lady making the crepes has it down to a science, and fans the rake as if she is working on a piece of art. Crepes are, of course, art to the food world, and Crepe Expectations is equivalent to the Met in my foodie mind's eye. This experience was the first for my husband, who had never had crepes before. Halfway through the meal, he declared that we need to make these at home, so I see a visit to Williams-Sonoma in our future. It is bittersweet that we live thousands of miles away from this little gem, which is good for my waistline but disappointing that I can't partake every Sunday!",F3CIIpity-yvACYbcinZrQ,1,0,5,5W_EpRBY-wwuXbbZCLkf4w

It was filling in a very light way.  Ingredients were fresh and complimented each other well.  There was also a delicious side of bite size watermelon to compliment the meal.

The GF had The Del Mar.  A crepe filled with sauteed shrimp and zucchini in a lemon butter sauce.  It was fantastic. 

The libations for our meal minus the boy, unless he snuck a sip on me somewhere was the Mimosa Trio Sampler.  The three we picked were white peach (Yum), Lychee (My fave) and regular OJ which after the first two never tasted so boring,

The piece de resistance was The Sticky-Sticky. Peanut butter, chocolate and carmel..Ohhh My!  Truly a delicious way to finishing off the meal.

The staff was happy and seemed to enjoy what they were preparing and serving.

BTW..You can watch your crepe being made via CCTV that is hanging over the kitchen area.

We all look forward to making our return to continue to explore all CE has to offer.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,2,2,4,N_2ACweYwSJTKiB3eRJHBQ

I go to Vegas to eat at Crepe Expectations. Ok fine, I go for the other stuff too, but seriously, one of the first things that comes to mind when my friends suggest a Vegas trip is crepes.

Here's what you need to do, go with at least one other person and share at least one savory crepe and one sweet crepe. Trust me, you need both. The turmoil and heartache that would result from trying to choose between a savory crepe and a sweet crepe would not be a burden I'd wish upon anyone. It looks like the menu has actually changed quite a bit since I've been there, but based on what I've had in the past I'll recommend the Sonora or the Little Italy for the savory crepe and for the sweet crepe, the Frisco is an absolute must-have.

Fresh, high quality ingredients combined with top notch culinary expertise and a dash of creativity make Crepe Expectations one of the best places to eat in Vegas. Please go here and feel free to thank me afterwards.",alMEbT01qByFl7xs6qoGLA,2,0,5,jQyZUGa48Hn7dwONWNe3wA

There was a line when we arrived, but it moved quickly. The inside is small, dark, but quaint. I ordered the La Jolla with soup as my side while my friend ordered the Berry Delight. We took our number stand to a table outside. A waiter came out to give us our drinks and it didn't take long for our food to arrive to our table.

The food (and drinks) are a little pricey, but Crepe Expectations makes up for it by how huge the crepes are. I was pretty much full for most of the day off my La Jolla and soup. Not to mention both my La Jolla and my friend's Berry Delight were delicious. I ordered the La Jolla on a whim and it was a good, yummy choice.

Once we had finished our plates, a waiter came outside to take our empty plates which was a pleasant surprised. These people are definitely on the ball.

I'd definitely come back to Crepe Expectations to eat again. There's plenty of other choices on the menu that I want to try. Also, for those who cannot have gluten, all the crepes on the menu except the Sonara can be made with rice flour. All you have to do is ask when you order.

Crepe Expectations is located in a busy plaza on Easter, this is the most competitive area for restaurants. However, they do manage to offer something unique for the area. I have had crepes before, but it wasn't at a restaurant that specialized in making crepes. I got two crepes to try out two different flavors; savory and sweet.

Savory Crepe
I asked for their suggestion on their savory crepe that had some spice to it. They recommended The Sonora, which is essentially a carne asada taco with guacamole. However, the crepe has an interesting texture, where the pores will absorb all the juices and when you eat the crepe you can taste all the flavor at once. I could taste the salty meat juices and guacamole flavors just in the crepe. Meat was very tender and the meal did come with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

Sweet Crepe
I also go their sweet crepe to taste, and I was more impressed with their sweet crepe then their  savory crepe. The Ana banana foster, crepe had carmely sweet sauced drenched on top and with in the crepe that was full of bananas. They gave whipped creme to go on top. The flavors were amazing, if you like bananas then you are going to enjoy a rich buttery/banana flavors that just ooze out of this crepe.

I am definitely coming back for more, the prices are reasonable ($7-9/crepe). Parking can be an issue during their busy hours.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,2,1,5,aCacaNJjvW9gorbO9RcP8A

The first time we went for lunch, we were greeted by Louis, the owner - a big man with a big beard and a bigger winning smile.  You order at the counter and they bring your crepe to your table as soon as it is ready (pretty quickly). My wife and I shared a veggie crepe. It came with either a salad or a small bowl of soup. The soup was a chicken broth base with some noodles. Good, but nothing special. The veggie crepe was very tasty, loaded with vegetables and very filling. Today, I sat outside on the patio. It is removed enough from the parking lot that it has a nice feel to it (I was the only one outside today, so it was especially nice for a quiet meal and some reading - yes, they have free WiFi). I had  the Grand Turk, a turkey crepe loaded with chunks of turkey and guacamole and some other ingredients (I had them skip the olives). This was outstanding! And the soup today was a black bean soup that was thick and loaded with black beans. YUM! All for $8 - such a deal. And it is served on real plates with real silverware - a very nice touch.

You can't even sit outside because it's too hot.  I tried to come in from the outside back into the restaurant and the automatic doors didn't even work. So needless to say I spilled my whole coffee all over myself. But that's OK things like that happen. The thing is, is that they took a sweet novelty and beautiful store that they had and brought it over two doors down and now it looks like they just slopped it all together.  
I came here the day after they moved here and have since expected to see a difference in the Decour and even to see if the tables were faxed because they were so lopsided.

Först och främst tog det en evighet att få våra crêpes, cirka 30 minuter och det var inte många före som beställde. Segheten verkade gälla för alla dock, så det var inte bara vi som var drabbade.

Sedan till min besvikelse så fick jag reda på att de använder sig av många redan färdiga produkter som chokladsås med high fructose corn syrup och därmed inte gör sina egna råvaror vilket var en enorm besvikelse då jag inte vill få i mig det.

Därför tvingades jag till att ta crêpes med bär som blåbär, jordgubbar, hallon och björnbär. Den var hyfsat god, inget superbt eller imponerande dock. Bären spelar en stor roll i en sådan crêpe och det var synd att de inte levererade bättre/färskare bär. 

I överlag så kan jag inte rekommendera detta ställe. Jag har ätit bättre crêpes på alla sätt vis på ställen som gör sina egna chokladsåser utan kemiskt farligt fejksocker.",8YDthec81bjPSa6Z10xOZg,1,0,2,jS_yfP6PlvRTmuV_2lev3g

When we walked in the door, my wife realized that it wasn't a traditional restaurant that you sit down and order, and she was at first very hesitant to eat here.  We approached to counter to order, and her reservations were quickly alleviated after talking to the gentleman behind the register, who happened to be the owner.  He suggested the chicken crepe special for our friend, and my wife and I split a sweet and a savory crepe.  We also ordered a Mimosa trio sampler.  It was hard to select between the 13 flavors!

When we come back we are going to add fresh spinach to our savory crepes, especially the Marco Polo crepe that had Italian sausage.  Adding the spinach will make it better.  The owner did suggest that we add mushrooms, which was an excellent recommendation.

The Frisco (blueberries, lemon curd, whipped cream, powdered sugar) was better than expected, particularly the lemon curd, but the whipped cream didn't seem particularly fresh and didn't have much flavor. The Sonora is one of the most-recommended options here, and it's easily one of the best crepes I've had, with carne asada, guac, cheese, and just a touch of salsa- it also comes with a tasty little bowl of soup. 

I'm not a fan of the tall high-top style tables or the large community-style table hogging the majority of the floor space, but the crepe bar seating is fun and there's even a camera above the griddle to watch how they are made.

We were greeted by the NICEST smile from Ana, who turned out to be a sweetheart. She is one of the owners and puts so much care into everything she does -- as it would become evident later. My friend and I each ordered a savory crepe - I had the Marco Polo (italian sausage, egg, jack cheese) while my friend ordered the Turk (turkey, jack, guacamole). We shared the mimosa trio made from fresh fruit puree (guava, passion fruit, and white peach). I opted for a coffee (illy espressemente coffee...amazing)! The mimosas came out quick and we absolutely loved the passion fruit and white peach ones - so delicious!

When we got the plates, I was shocked. The crepes, aside from being beautifully presented, came with a side of fruit (cantaloupe), and were generously portioned. I was expecting the usual crepes-that-would-barely-qualify-as-a-snack size crepes, and had mentally prepared myself to be hungry after. NOT THE CASE. I was stuffed and the fruit was a perfect way to top things off. My friend and I were SOLD!

Then, we remembered we had ordered a dessert crepe (once again, my above frame of mind of expecting tiny portions) -- the William Tell, which has sauteed apples, caramel, whipped cream. We were craving nuts and Ana suggested throwing in some caramelized walnuts. AMAZING. TRUST THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE GIVES YOU SUGGESTIONS!!

All in all, we were gushing to Ana about how we loved everything, and she let us in on a few secrets. My friend and I dislike overly-sweet desserts, and this was perfectly done. Ana mentioned that the crepe batter doesn't have any sugar -- no wonder! 

Also, we watched her make a customer the Veggie crepe. It was filled with sauteed veggies and hummus. She told us that it was 150 calories! For such a generous portion, I'd definitely come back just to try it. What a total win-win, when you can eat something hearty (and a crepe at that) and have it just be 150 calories!

2008610,2011-10-03,1,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Crepe Expectations is a stylish little corporate European style cafe serving up a wide variety of crepes.  Now I'm not the biggest crepe fan in the world (usually a little too sweet for me), but this place has plenty of tasty options, with a wide variety of coffees, beers, and wines.  

It's a solid place for a coffee date with some inventive food options.  The decor is stylish stone and slightly darkened.  I was there for breakfast, but it seemed like a decent, slightly quirky choice for a first date.

The crepes themselves are light and airy pancakes made mostly from eggs.  They're a classic option in French and Swiss breakfasts, but Crepe Expectations has taken the classic crepe and fused in a colorful variety of filling options.  

While I was there, I started off with the Sonora.  We're in the SW and I wanted to know what the French crepe filled with filled with flank steak, fresh avocado and cheese would taste like.  The steak was properly cooked and still tender but I'm not sure if the Sonora is a great dish overall.  The steak is heavy and I appreciate a filling meal, but the crepe made the dish feel more like a wet burrito.  I loved the contents, just wasn't won over by the combination of crepe and burrito filling.

I also had the Avalon--a crepe filled with goat cheese, honeyed pear and walnuts.  Dear god that is sweet.  A little too sweet.  I loved the consistency of the walnuts and the softened pears, but the honeyed pear completely overwhelmed the tartness in the goat cheese.  That said, I want to love this crepe.  Even sitting here, I want to reach back into the past and dial back the honey on the crepe.  When I took matters into my own hands, controlled what was on my fork, and made sure there was plenty of goat cheese, it was a really wonderful flavor combination.  

The coffee was well-roasted and rich.  And they had nice little touches, like offering cucumber water and lemon water with the meal.  The beer and wine menu had some nice small brewery/small winery options and I'm a big fan of this place.  All in all, Crepe Expectations has earned a firm spot in my brunch rotation.

Based on the food, this place gets a solid 3.5 stars.  Inventive menu--that's pretty close to delicious even if the flavors were a little too sweet for me or a little off in my opinion.  The food was still prepared expertly and I do like imagination in a menu.  I threw in the extra .5 star because the staff is very welcoming and helpful.

Size doesn't matter in this case! We tried the Sonora (carne asada) and the Marco Polo (Italian sausage & egg). Started all with a Habanero laced Michilada. 
The carne asada in the Sonora wasn't your usual burrito stand asada.  It was very tender,  nicely marinated and finished perfectly with guacamole. The side salad was just a tiny treat in itself. A small portion of spinach laced with a sneaky taco flavored dressing. Quite a treat in itself.
The Marco Polo is a breakfast dish.  Sausage,  egg & light cheese. I added mushrooms.  This was good with a dash of tapatio but I think I'm a Sonora fan. 
You shouldn't be disappointed here.  The folks from the show are the folks making your food,  taking your order and visiting you at your table. Great, real people and a fun visit.  My only regrets.... Not trying something from the Mimosa selection and leaving room for a dessert! We'll be back for the William Tell dessert.

This is an order at the register, then seat yourself kinda place. The chef/owner was our cashier, and he was so welcoming and friendly. As Jessie put it ""I always feel like my business is appreciated when I come here."" She couldn't be more correct. All of the staff I encountered were friendly and they seemed genuinely happy to serve us. This is one of the main reasons I love supporting local businesses. We were seated outside on the patio, which was great because the weather was nice. They also have seats inside, but be prepared to wait. The place is small and always packed! This, however, is a good thing!

Onto the food. I couldn't make up my mind, there were sweet and savory crepes and they all sounded delicious. I didn't even know you could get a savory crepe! I ended up with the Reuben crepe which comes stuffed with corned beef, sauerkraut and thousand island. It even had fennel sprinkled on the outside of the crepe! It was realllllly good. My crepe came with either a side salad or a cup of soup. I chose the latter, and it was pretty good. It was a light, chickeney broth with noodles. Not too heavy, but tasty and perfect for a side dish.

Jessie and I decided to split the mimosa sampler, which comes with 3 flavors of your choice. All of the flavors sounded amazing, but we went with white peach, watermelon and blood orange. The sampler glasses are pretty small, so I would advise each person getting their own. Anyway the white peach was definitely my favorite flavor.

I got there before my party and they did not seat me, which was kind of annoying, since I wanted a mimosa. Oh well.

(4) value: even though the tea is really pricey ($4 for a teabag in a pot, yikes!), they've got endless refills of illy coffee for around $3 and $10 for a trio of mimosas. That's value (4).

I brought my out of town friends here for a little Sunday morning breakfast. As we first walked in, they loved the hip colour scheme and the comfortable seating area. Add in the video screen to watch your crepe being made, we were really feeling the love.

The owners strategically placed large containers of flavoured (lemon and cucumber) iced water, self-serve coffee, and condiments on a cute little bevie counter. I loved this feature - so much more convenient for customers to be able to help themselves. The only thing I would like to see added is a canister for refilling hot water for teapots.

I also enjoyed the fact that the menu is varied and offers not only sweet but savory crepes for those who aren't really into sweets. They also offer gluten free crepes as well. Prices range from $5.50 (simple sugar crepe) to $9 (crepes with steak or shrimp in it) with the majority of their specialty crepes falling around the $7 mark. Trust me, for the quality and the ambience, it's definitely worth it.

We each got a Monkey crepe - you know - the standard nutella/banana combination. I have to say, it's one of the better crepes I've had in a while. It had a nice texture with it's lovely brown crispiness on the outside which pared well with its molten chocolate hazelnut filling. Truer to the French styled creperie (a little more butter content, a little thinner and less spongy) than other places (lots of Asian creperies around), it's a really solid rendition of a culinary classic.

I was a little taken aback by the prices for tea. $4 for a teabag in a pot seemed a little steep for my tastes although the Earl Grey was nicely mellow with lovely floral hints when I tried it.

Too bad I don't like coffee because the real steal here is the self-serve bottomless cup of illy coffee for less than $3. Yep! it's like the best deal in town for a quality cup of joe. My friend  was amazed at how good it was (""it's so smooth!"")and had at least 3 giant cups (""can I get another cup? We're not in a rush, are we?"") before she left. Beat that Starbucks!

But, since I'm never going back again, I guess I need not take the path of the sheepish.

Like I said, great people in the store. The customers seemed nice, too. (Although the people at the table right next to the crepe station were annoyed that I had to keep standing near them to read the menu. Not a great spot for a table.) A group of people stopped us before we went inside and raved - raved! - about how we had to try the pulled pork (I think it was) crepe. So, I get that this place has big fans, and I may just be the oddball. (My loss.)

A variety of neat bottled sodas stands ready in the big fridge, and if you aren't a member of the Secret Ginger Beer Club who already knows where to get The Very Best Ginger Beer in Town, good news: they sell it here. Ask for a stumpy brown bottle of brewed Bundaberg ginger beer and prepare to walk among the initiated. 

(But, once you're hooked, I recommend buying it when it's on sale at Cost Plus World Market - as far as I know, the only other place here that sells it.)

I love that there's a selection of both sweet and savoury crepes served with your choice of soup and side salad at a reasonable price. I also think it's clever how a camera points down at the preparation area, so you can watch your crepes being prepared. Neat-o.

Where everything falls apart for me, though, is the taste.

My husband and I both ordered savoury crepes. I got the caprese, one of the two vegetarian options. (The other has hummus, which I wasn't ready to try in a crepe yet. I really wanted something kind of traditional with cheese and was disappointed that the caprese with mozzarella, a slow melter, was my only vegetarian option.) 

I've eaten quite a few crepes, both sweet and savoury, since the first French Club field trip back in junior high. I've never eaten them in Paris, granted, but in 30+ years of crepe-eating around the country, I always experienced two constants until visiting Crepe Expectations:

1. The crepe itself tasted like something nice in its own right.

2. The finished crepe was not indistinguishable from a wrap sandwich.

Looking at reviews here, and judging by the other customers when I was in CE, I guess mine is the minority opinion. (My husband is also in this minority - I suppose we're lucky we found each other.) I'm happy for the rest of you that you can find joy in crepes three inches high. 

(Okay, looking at photos here I can see that some people have had more sensibly sized crepes, but ours were huge. I felt like it was 1998 and I was getting a two-handed wrap at the Sonic Drive-Thru.)

But even if my crepe had been assembled with a finer touch, not only was the crepe itself completely tasteless and acting only as a wrapper, but the flavors inside were only ""A-OK."" I couldn't even smell the basil inside my caprese (although that could be because the pesto overwhelmed everything else).

I applaud the idea of Crepe Expectations, and they're probably a great option from the usual if you're working in the area and want something different for lunch, but the next time I'm specifically hungry for melty, herby, toasty, savoury crepes, I'll head for the Strip instead.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,7,2,3,ox52EbUAZyqXR_vIV7CS0A

I am always leery of crepe shops because the crepes usually take a long time to prepare and can come out either runny gooey or too thick and firm.  Crepe Expectations makes them just right.  They are fresh and do take a considerable time to come out but are worth the wait.

2310800,2013-11-24,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Driven by this place many times and didn't even know it was there.  Its in a center with a lot of other restaurants.  Its a small location with probably 10 or so tables with a couple more outside.  The place was packed when we got there and this is where the process is a bit weird.  You need to check in with the cashier to put in your name down.  This is the same place you order as well but not until a table is ready.  Sort of a hybrid of the order and pay with open seating and the more traditional sit and then order from a server. Even though there are no servers  the staff roams the floor looking to help where possible.  The only part I didn't like is that waiting for tables is done in the hallway toward the back.  Not much can be done with that though because the place is pretty small.

As for ambiance the location is cozy and has low lighting even during the day.  The crepe stations are up front and open so you can watch the chefs work their magic.  They've even got overhead camera view above so you can watch from the tables.  There are also 2 TVs on the walls which were showing football today which was a pleasant surprise.

The service was friendly both at the cashier and the staff walking around.  The iced tea cups were pretty small which is always a disappointment for me because I drink a lot during the meal.  Fortunately the staff member that brought the tea must have sensed my mood because not only did he ask if we usually drink a lot of tea, when we replied yes he brought a full pitcher and left it at the table just for us. Even better there was plenty of ice in the pitcher so no concern of tea melting the ice in my glass (another pet peeve).

On to the food.  I went breakfast with the rosarito which has chorizo, scrambled eggs, jack cheese and guacamole.  It was quite tasty.  Only thing missing was a bit of salsa on top (maybe some sour cream too).  Also came with either bananas or cottage cheese on the side.  I went with sliced bananas which were a good compliment to the savory crepe.  My wife had the little Italy which was pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomatoes basil sauce.  It was like a pizza in a crepe (thankfully she let me try it as I'll probably get that when I want lunch.) Her crepe came with fidejo soup which was like chicken noodle minis the chicken chunks.  Very good.

We couldn't be pass up a chance for a dessert crepe so we split the monkey which has Nutella, bananas, chocolate, whip cream and we added strawberries.   This was definitely my favorite of the three. 

The portions are quite large so we couldn't eat everything. Probably could have split one savory and then the sweet. The crepes were all delicious and it was cool to watch the chefs make them to order too.  

To round out the experience both the wait staff and the cashier thanked us for coming in and made sure to ask for us to come back soon.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars was the somewhat awkward waiting in the narrow hallway.  I'm not sure there is much they can do about it though and it will definitely  not deter me from coming back again.

Thanks for the great meal.",llFdDwi1hLv11SRQPfqpbQ,0,0,4,gbovuZQ4LC_BvHTE6KzNTA
2318850,2012-10-22,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME! Came here for brunch on a Sunday between 12-1. I was not expecting an ""order at the counter and then we'll bring it to you"" style, but that wasn't much of a problem.

There is an employee who kind of patrols the ordering line, asking people how many are in their party and then getting them a table. They don't take your order until you have a table to sit at.  Here lies the problem. There is ONE THING I do not like about this place: it isn't big enough. So, when it's crowded, it can be a bit stressful and an awkward wait because of how small the dining area is. We were initially seated at a small table right in the middle of the ordering line, and I didn't like it at all. I do not like it when people are standing over me while I'm eating or trying to enjoy a nice conversation/drinks/good company. But, when I asked if we could have another table, the employee happily said ""No problem, it will just be a few minutes."" So, we got a taller bar-stool table on the side. 

When our table was ready, we ordered. The man taking orders seemed to be either the owner of the head honcho of sorts. He was very friendly and happy to make recommendations. I ordered the Rosarito (chorizo, guacamole, jack cheese, eggs) and my girlfriend ordered the Perfect Combination (strawberries, chocolate, whipped cream, powdered sugar). 

I also ordered the Mimosa trio sampler. First of all, they have a chalkboard full of various mimosa flavors (mango, blood orange, orange, passion fruit, white peach, strawberry, raspberry, etc.) and you could pick THREE of them for $10. And these ""sampler"" size cups were not small. I thought they were the same size as any mimosa I'd order at any other brunch place. I chose blood orange, raspberry and passion fruit. The passion fruit and blood orange were my favorite!

The food took a bit to come out, which is slightly surprising because it's CREPES, but I didn't mind the wait because the decor is wonderful and I had amazing company and drinks to keep me busy. 

Once our food came, I was surprised at how huge they were. I couldn't finish mine, but wow it was delicious! I have never had a better crepe in my life. My girlfriend loved hers and she also said it was the best she had ever had. The crepes aren't too thin but aren't too thick or overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn't get over how delicious and perfect everything was cooked. 

So, EVEN THOUGH I think they were a bit unorganized (they need more space or a better organization of tables inside) and slightly slow with service, I CANNOT give less than 5 stars because of how delicious the food and drinks were (and cheap! $7-8 for a LARGE crepe!). Also, the staff was friendly and attentive.

My husband had no problem finishing his crepe which was basically pepperoni pizza inside... One that we got for our 2 year old daughter which was the cheapest one on the menu with just sugar or powder inside? It ended up being my favorite out of the 4 we ordered...

Waited about 20 minutes to be seated (outside) as it was very busy on a Saturday morning. After being assigned a seating area, you immediately order your food at the cashier front. (So I suggest asking for a menu as soon as you get in)

Quality: The portion of the Sunday Morning Crepe's was the right amount for 1 serving. It is stuffed with Eggs, Cheese, Bacon and you can also add many other meats to fill up your Crepe the way you like it. The taste was great if your looking for quality.

Service: I can say service was pretty quick if your walking in for a party of 2. The front cashier was very helpful in recommending what to try. Don't be afraid to ask if your not sure what's on their menu.

Price: Per meal they ranged about $6.95-$10. Adding extras such as Bacon was .75 cents more. Comparing to IHOP or Dennys, you'll get your money's worth here with quality. 

*Military Discount: Yes

Overall it was worth the drive to try something new if you don't mind driving the distance, If your looking for Crepes (Mild, Spicy or Sweet) to satisfy your hunger for breakfast/lunch. This is the place to be.",lvAeZLgIP_N5w6ufb8qdVw,0,0,4,Wv3kHo1XS4Oc4AmfQsBWSg

2357885,2012-08-06,1,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Before I begin my review, I would first like to state the most negative part of Crepe Expectations: 

The fact I live in Orange County, CA and this place is all the way in Henderson, NV.  That is a real bummer to me now that I have tried this place out.

My wife and a couple of friends visited Lake Mead over the weekend and didn't want to suffer the consequences of 10 bathroom breaks on the way home by eating the hotel's breakfast buffet.  So what did I do?  I fired up Siri on my iPhone and asked it where I can eat something good for breakfast as we strolled through Henderson.  Crepe Expectations topped the recommended food restaurants with its massive amounts of positive reviews so we said screw it, lets try this place out.

Upon driving up, the store looks pretty timid and small - but was quite busy and thriving on the patio so it was pretty inviting.  When you walk through the door it reminds you of a very classy bar type of atmosphere with most of the tables packed with couples and families, and overall just a great atmosphere.

When walking up to the counter the owner, Lou, was smiling ear to ear.  This guy was one of the most enthusiastic business owners I have ever met, you could tell he cares about his customers and has a lot of passion for what he does.  He took the time to explain various items on the menu in great detail, and was very well-spoken and articulated every detail of the dish he was explaining.  It was just so refreshing to see someone that stoked about what they do and how they run their business- you don't see that too often around my neck of the woods unfortunately. 

Anyway, my wife and I ordered the Sunday Morning plates and my friends ordered some other Crepe's that I do not recall.  We also ordered some Mimosa's which they had a huge menu of various flavors.

Then the food came out - granted I have never even had a Crepe in my life... AMAZING.  The food was so tasty I can't even describe it.  My dish I had them add Serrano peppers and diced ham - I couldn't believe how great it tasted.  We requested some hot sauce and Lou recommended their house salsa.. best idea ever.  The salsa was so awesome, it was better than most authentic Mexican restaurants salsa!  

The food was perfect, the service was prompt and courteous, and the owner himself is there to make sure everything comes out well and to your liking.  I felt like I was in his own dining room and a guest of Lou & his wife's house and left wanting to come back again, but unfortunately that won't be able to happen until our next Lake Mead trip.. next year :(",QgOSZokucNu-UTwBEiUk-Q,3,1,5,_5hXAY3zZSGz2M1bK3LSCA

I'll settle for incredible. The crepe was light, and almost melted in my mouth. The ingredients were fresh. It was probably one of the best crepes I have ever had, even without the nutella.

Right place, right time!  We got there just in time to snag a two-top inside (not much cooler than out, but better still).  I ordered ""The Crepelet"" (ham, swiss, and egg) and my boyfriend ordered ""The Rosarito"" (guac, chorizo, egg, cheese).  They come with a choice of sliced bananas or cottage cheese and they're HUGE!  I ordered The Crepelet because I wanted something savory without onions, but beware!  The ham has onions and tomatoes kinda on it.  It's not overpowering, but if you're sensitive to onions, keep it in mind.

What's really cool is that the owners are working at the restaurant, so you really get to see that it's a small business!  Another cool thing- you can watch them make your crepe on a tv they have up by the register (you can see it if you're seated inside).  It's really neat to watch them actually make the crepe (not premade and reheated like at IHOP and other places)!  

One thing to note: we looked online at the menu before arriving and noticed that the prices online are about 25-50 cents lower than what's listed in store (not a big deal, but maybe you need those quarters!).",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,0,0,3,RBB9et-lRjind3hQl82Sug

No thank you ""The Hall"" is crowded with customers at tables and right next to the bathrooms. The place is really small. Not much seating inside for how busy they were. It gets very crowded with tight tables/seating and standing in line to place your order. We ate outside, so that was a lot cooler and quieter. 
Service was very good. We placed our orders and had them in a few minutes. One of us had the Rosarita, Chicken Greek, and Sonora. The crepes were very light and full of meat/veggie whatever we had ordered. We also had ""salad"" aka greens and bananas. We all liked ours, but agreed that my Sonora (Carne Asada, guacamole, and smoky salsa was the favorite. We wanted to try a dessert crepe, but were too full.

This review 6 months ago would have been 5 stars. The food is fantastic! I have been coming here with my girlfriends every weekend or every other since it opened and I have to write a review in hopes that the owners read this about how horrible their customer service has gone down. I only took away 2 STARS for the service/atmosphere.

The porters/servers are still wonderful and hustle to make sure everyone is happy and has hot food, but the standing in line to give your name and be crammed in a hallway to sit is horrible. The owner who runs the register is yelling out names and barking orders to the staff in every direction it's hard to enjoy the atmosphere. Let's no reinvent the wheel here let's get a host stand and a server to take the orders and call it a day. The Panera bread table number system clearly is not working any longer since the popularity boom, so I hope this review is taken as constructive, because I want to enjoy my Crepe place again!",s6LABbdGNn4WykpATIvhHQ,6,0,3,OTX_8fzb1jdESCbRj-La8Q

My dad opts for The Monterey -- hold the monterey (he doesn't eat cheese).

And my sister is a complete fiend for the Ana Bananas Foster. Seriously! She won't share!

Of course we always try to try different crepes (Also recommend The Caprese or The Avalon! Yum!), but we've come to the conclusion that you really can't go wrong here.

AND! They have a cute little station for the Sunday morning doggies who want to grab a bite too! Haven't brought my pup yet cause I'm not sure if she can behave herself around the crepes!

We were seated quickly and handed menus and tins to get up and order at the counter when ready. That wasn't a issue with us. The restaurant is small but cozy, and ha mostly high top tables which I enjoy since I'm rather teller. On the side are some bench style seats wit chairs on the other side. Not really too good for big groups of more then 4 people. 
Back to our experience. We ordered The Little Italy Crêpe and the Caprese chicken Crêpe with grilled chicken. Took exactly 20 minutes from time of receipt to time of food being delivered to our table. That was extremely long since it wasn't busy. All other tables already had their food. So why the length of time? Unsure. 
The Caprese salad Crêpe was flavorless, with huge chunks of tomatoes and chicken in it, but the pieces were not cut into bite size or manageable pieces plus the lack of chicken for the extra dollar was appalling. The Crêpe itself was tasty, and would be good with a sweet Crêpe. 
The Little Italy Crêpe was over filled with tomato sauce, using that as the star ingredient. Tasty but then again it seemed like it was just tomato sauce only. 
Manager or owner was floating around saying hello and thank you to everyone but managed every time to forget us. Maybe because we didn't buy a bottle of wine or champagne...smh.

The gist of this place is crepes but with a twist.  Instead of just the ""sweet"" treat that you normally expect a crepe to be, this joint also offers ""savory"" and ""breakfast"" selections.

My wife and I tried the Sonora (carne asada, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese) from the savory menu and the Monkey (nutella, banana, chocolate drizzle, fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar and added strawberries for 50 cents more) from the sweet menu.

The portions were great.  Big enough to fill you up on your first meal.  The Sonora came with a soup or salad and I asked for some of the home made salsa on the side to dip.   The Sonora reminds me of a delicious Mexican burrito.  Just enough spicy kick to it.  The lighter crepe pancake vs. a whole tortilla wrap from a traditional burrito was a good change from the norm.   My wife who doesn't even like spicy foods enjoyed it as well.

The Monkey was obviously my wife and daughter's favorite.  Even I couldn't resist a few bites of this delicious treat.  There were ample amounts of fruit and chocolate filling inside and we found ourselves cleaning the plate of every piece.  Very enjoyable.

The reason I can't give a perfect 5 is because of the confusion I'd assume plenty of new customers would get like ourselves the moment you walk in the door.  As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by a server.  He seated us very promptly and handed us menu's and then left.  We waited patiently for him to return to offer to take our order and maybe serve us waters to start.  He never did return and it wasn't until minutes later that we realized that we had to go up and order at the counter.  Why give us menus at the table if we have to walk up and look at the menu at the front anyways?

To sum it up, I would say this place is like a suburban version of Jean Philippe Patisserie, complete with fancy free water infused with lemon, and water infused with cucumbers. And man, was Will Ferrell right. Those cucumbers really make the water refreshing!

The ambiance is really relaxing and has a sort of dark, romantic, date-like atmosphere. I also get that this place focuses on ""traditional"" French crepes, but at around $8 a crepe, I have a hard time justifying coming here when Crepe Shack is just down the street. But that's just me and my preference for handy dandy crepes in a cone. However, I will say that the Avalon crepe (I think that's what it's called) with the goat cheese and pears and all that, was A-MAH-ZING. I would totally come back just for that! I mean, it's not like the crepes are bad, in fact they're quite good here. The price is just... not my cup of tea.

Located in a strip mall, we were a little wary when we arrived but we left full and happy. 

We were seated outside on a beautiful day after we placed our order at the register.  They offer free lemon and cucumber water inside the restaurant.  Our waiter was very attentive and kept checking on us to see if we needed anything. 

The food is delicious and cooked to order.  I had The Sonora which was Carne Asada steak roasted tomato salsa, guacamole and jack cheese with a salad.  The crepe was pretty big and filled with steak that was nicely cooked (not chewy) and well seasoned.  I was stuffed by the end of my meal.  The crepe and an ice tea set me back by $12.50 - a bargain for such deliciousness.

Crepe Expectation's crepes are large and packed with only FRESH ingredients.  They're all made to order right before your very eyes and adjustments to ingredients are well received.  Ana has this graceful technique when she makes your crepes.  I was so mesmerized on her skill, that I actually thought I could spread crepe batter at home as perfectly as her (yeah right, lol).  Speaking of they're batter, it contains no extra salt or sugar, so it's perfect for entree or dessert crepes.  Menu-wise, they have crepes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert!

DINNER:
I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review for this restaurant!  It's been so long that I can only remember that I had a breakfast crepe filled with scrambled egg, cheese, and breakfast meats.  So delish,  filling, and comforting!  The hubby had The Sonora which was carne asada, cheese, roasted tomato salsa, and guacamole.  He loved it so much he came back the next day for lunch with three coworkers.

DESSERT:
We were soooo full by the end of our dinner that I almost had to unbutton my jeans.  Somehow, we made room for desserts.  Yes, desserts with an ""s"" on the end; not a shared dessert; two individual dessertS!!!  I got the Perfect Combination with a heaping full of fresh strawberries, fresh whipped cream, chocolate drizzle, and powdered sugar.  Hubby got the William Tell which was sauteed apples, caramel, fresh whipped cream, and powdered sugar.  WOW!

The restaurant itself is located in a large strip mall next to the indoor exotic car dealership.  It's small inside but, every space is well utilized.  That being said, the building does face the west, so during the evenings the sun is blaring in, making the restaurant on the warm side.  The color inside is mainly black and purple (eggplant'ish), accented with marble, stone, and glass, very classy and contemporary in my opinion.  Somehow, they managed to fit in a small coffee station where sugar, honey, creamer, tap water, and cucumber water (complementary) are available.  Speaking of coffee, they are also a full service ""coffee house"", serving (Illy's I think???) cappuccino, espresso, latte, coffee, and hot teas.  Feeling a little tipsy?  They also have beer and wine!  All other beverages are bottled, including sodas, juices, and waters. 

Last but not least, Crepe Expectations does have a few outside tables and welcomes canine patrons with an outside bin of complementary doggy biscuits.

I came here because I saw the place mentioned on the food network. So I thought it would be a great place to go when visiting Vegas - I was wrong. As I was inside with my daughter a party of 6 arrived. They all ordered and sat down. It wasn't very busy at all. However, the cashier got one of the orders wrong and that upset the owner Lou very much. He was furious started yelling, and insisted that they never got the order wrong and said that they would have to pay again if they wanted a new order. Well that didn't sit with the party of 6 very well and the owner and the other guest got into a full blown argument. The owner and the guests were all yelling and cursing at each other. I never saw such terrible customer service ever in my life! It was like a movie! The owner came from behind the counter and walked towards the guests- 5 women and 1 man-and he charged at them as if he was going to hit one of the women. That disgusted me even more. I mean him cursing and yelling while children were in his establishment was bad enough. But once he walked towards the women and called them bitches I was done! After he told them to leave I was so scared as a bystander because the guest threw all there food on the ground and attempted to push over the table! The owner should never allow situations as small as a wrong order get that out of hand! The customer service here is beyond terrible! After the guest walked out they even broke some wine glasses that were left on the table from previous customers! When the owner came back inside he was so rude to everyone and never even apologized for the terrifying altercation that had just took place!  If you want to come here and possibly be caught in the cross fire as angry customers battle it out with this disgusting owner this is the place for you! If not I recommend going somewhere else because it's only a matter of time before he's rude to someone else and they get into another terrifying brawl.

2931825,2011-10-02,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"So, I'm biased because I already know I love crepes.  That is more than I can say for the boy who, after being served, asked why there was a pancake on his food.  I love the modernly styled atmosphere, and the novelty of the ""crepe cam"" (it is exactly as it sounds, camera feeding to a TV so you can watch your crepes being made).  And, as everyone said, the staff were incredibly friendly, that will keep me coming back.

Crepe Expectations does a great job with having a diverse menu of savory and sweet ""dishes"".  Additionally, they have fantastic prices on beer for a boutique cafe!  Most of the standard beers were only $3, and they have a pretty extensive wine and specialty drinks menu for a creperie.  They also offer the treat of all-you-can-drink serve-yourself water infused with lemon or cucumber.  Yum.  If you want ""plain water"" I think you might have to request that specially.  Bother the flavors were subtle enough I think even finicky folks can handle it.

Warning: one crepe per person is sufficient.  I expected street food style where we may want a couple each.  Bad move.   We discovered that three crepes for two people was far too much food.  

I tried the Sunday Morning - which was just what I was hoping for on a Sunday morning, egg, seasoned potatoes, and cheese wrapped in a crepe.  It was a yummy savory breakfast, but honestly, with such a hearty filling, the crepe itself kind of fades into the background.  That said, I much prefer it to a standard omelet, primarily for the side bites of mostly crepe.  I do love eggy crepes...  I also tried The Avalon - pears, goat cheese, walnuts, and honey.  The flavors of pear, goat cheese, and walnut were rich and delicious.  However, the honey was a bit overwhelmingly sweet.  I guess eating three bites instead of 30 at a time is better for me anyway.  More for later!

Summary: great variety of food, friendly staff, ample creativity in dishes, good prices, I just wish the crepe to food ratio was a little higher.  That's not enough of a deterrent to keep me away, though.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,1,1,4,EfUUSTHa9I7R51WiG3krSQ

Seeing all the different crepe combinations was fun, but when we actually got out crepes we didn't really expect all of the ingredients to be minimal. For example, instead of using actual fruit or berries, it was a puree version. 

The caramel latte was pretty good and was served in a large wide mouth cup, which cooled down pretty fast. The rest of our party ordered coffee (they had you a mug to fill out own), and they easily exchanged the chipped mugs for betters ones when we asked.

Overall, Crepe Expectations would be a great place to come back later in the day when it's not as cold and when I'm not expecting a full meal to hold me over. I'd love to try their mimosas on a lazy Sunday.

Next time I visit, I will have to try new things on their menu and see what else they have to offer.

While I've always had a pretty good experience here, my last visit was a little less than stellar.

Family and friends recommended this place to me previously but I had never been despite their recommendations. I finally went here (because it's off the strip so hence we don't always want to drive more) and OMG was it worth it! Let me start by saying the bf and I both liked their mimosa selections and tasting- we each got 4 different flavors. I would steer clear of the peach because it was WAY too sweet. I surprising liked the tangerine and the pineapple the most. The watermelon one was okay. 

Bf had a regular savory crepe (I don't remember which one, but it had bacon) and it was delicious. There was some sauce on it and I think it would have been better if they hadn't been so heavy handed with it but it was pretty freaking good.

I had a sweet crepe with berries and I even asked for extra berries. My crepe, of course, was gluten free. It was much thicker and more like a pancake than a crepe and therefore super filling. However, if you regularly (or just have ever) eaten a gluten pancake you will know that what they have here certainly qualifies as a crepe as opposed to a pancake. If you have not eaten gluten free pancake then you will feel like this is too thick to be a crepe, but it isn't. I could not finish my crepe because it was so large. It was a little too sweet for me but it might not be for others.

Overall the service was good too, entertaining to watch them make the crepes, food came quickly, bathrooms were clean, etc. Honestly this is a 4.5-5 star rating but I feel like I haven't tasted enough to give it the full 5 stars. 

Come after peak time, like after 12 or 12:30 to walk right in.",gvJGewk1lWgSB9m2Sy6KiQ,0,0,4,BM8hlHMBt-45EFbkA0RtHA

CE offers a wide variety of delicious crepes to match whatever you are looking for. From a sweet tooth to a hearty meal they have it. I cannot pick a favorite because every item I have ever had there is amazing and excellently crafted. 
CE is located in a very big wide open plaza with a lot of dinning options. The kicker here is that they have limited hours. Only open to 3pm so you really have to get there early. Best time to visit is during the week as weekends are absolutely crazy there. Great sign for the business, bad sign of you are seeking a crêpe fix fast.

She loved how the slightly browned exterior of the crepe gave it texture against the hardy filling.

Be sure to check out the ""Crepe Cam"" over the cooking station so you can watch your food being made. Also, love that they have complimentary flavored water available that you can help yourself to.

I wanted the one with shrimp, since I saw it on the chalkboard menu in the restaurant. However the register dude told me there's no more shrimp and recommended the salmon lox-type crepe, which came with a side salad.  I agreed and waited for my food to be prepared. 

When I finally opened my food, I was really disappointed with the salad. There was like five green leaves!  I couldn't stand all the cream cheese without the salad.

We were definitely going to visit when we got to Vegas.  Oh, they have crepes, too?  That's cool.  So we touch down in Vegas at the abysmal hour of 10:00am (!) and proceed to Crepe Expectations.  There was a total of 4 of us so we decided to get 2 breakfast crepes, 2 sweet crepes, and then we would just split them all.  The 2 breakfast crepes that we ordered were the Monterey Crepe and the Rosarito Crepe.  I can't...I just can't.  I'm getting a headache now just thinking about HOW GOOD that ish was.  Really?  Really?!  The cheese was gooey and everything was so flavorful.  My friends were debating which crepe was better of the two.  At that point I'm like, ""Who gives a f@ck?!""  They were both blowing my mind!  Cut to the 2 sweet crepes: Bananas Foster and Perfect Combination.  The Bananas Foster ruled HANDS DOWN!  God I wanted to lick that plate.  But on to better things:  THE MIMOSA TRIO SAMPLER!!!  We EACH got a sampler, so yes, 12 mimosas were on our table.  I ordered the orange (yes I stay true to the original, thank you very much), white peach and passion fruit.  When you order the passion fruit they provide a little spoon for you to mix the drink with.  There are also several other flavors to choose from as well.  I thought that the white peach and passion fruit were too sweet, but the orange?  JUST RIGHT.  And DON'T call me boring because the orange was my favorite.  I just appreciate the classics, that's all.  They're in pretty small glasses, so....yes, I ordered another sampler.  What?  Don't judge.  But when I ordered the second sampler, Mike, who I believe is the owner and totally AWESOME in every way, gave me the rest of the champagne that was left and told me to go to town.  And go to town we did.  When we were done licking our plates and boozing it up, Mike proceeded to bring us free bowls of soup!  What the hell?!  Mike, we love you!!!!

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Prior to walking in it's helpful if you know the system at Crepe Expectations. It's seemingly always crowded, so know that you have to get in line and while you're there the friendly staff will try and line up a table for you. It doesn't always work, but they do a heck of a job keeping the operation running smoothly even in the face of lengthy lines. Kudos. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Pretty much everything at Crepe Expectations sits below the $10.00, which is a real bargain given the portion sizes. I opted for the special of the day which was a Green Chili Verde savory crepe, and I ended up with a meal that probably could have fed a person and a half. Good value. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

My Green Chili Verde Chicken crepe was very, very good with fresh ingredients and good flavors that came together in the crepe, but it was my girlfriend's breakfast crepe that was truly spectacular with eggs and breakfast meats from far and wide. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Not only is the staff friendly but as busy as this place gets they amaze me of how great of a service they provide to all their customers. 

The only ""negative"" thing is that is a bit small of a place. But I must say it is worth the wait (when waiting for a table).

I also tried the 'perfect combination' which was almost perfect if the strawberries were fresh and not too sour! Also tried the 'monterey' which was very good and just a little bit on the spicy side - but made it really good! Also tried the mimosa sampler. I picked the mango, watermelon and passion fruit. I liked the watermelon best and then passion fruit. Mango was alright but tasted off at the end. I will most likely go back next time but will think twice because of the wait time and the limited seating could lead to an awkward seat section. The guy sitting the customers seemed quick but not so attentive. The guy taking the order was nice but too fast for the crepe line.

The waitstaff was awesome and gave great recommendations on food and mimosa.  The food came out quick, the mimosas fresh, and the the portions more than expected.  The prices are also very reasonable ($8/meal, $10/3 mimosa sampler), especially given the same type of cuisine and quality on the strip would be 2.5x the price.

I feel like their portion sizes are a little small however for the prices they charge for their crêpes, but as my friend pointed out, ""Dane, these are human-sized portions."" So perhaps that's just me being an overeating-American. Good job on the food quality-wise, but if they ever decided to give you more food per the price they charge I certainly wouldn't talk them out of it.

The dim lights.  I think the word is intimate?  Not that intimate because alot of people go there and it can get a little loud (but not to the point where you're yelling at your friend).  Patio seating is available too.  The weather was cloudy (with some rain) the last time I came, but they had a tent if you still wanted to sit outside.  I did.

This is the perfect place to hang with your girlfriends for mimosas, champagne, and brunch.  It just has that ambiance to it.

Water options include cucumber water or regular water.  Cute.  Cucumber water tastes so much better than regular water.

Sweet and Savory menus.  All crepes are good for two people (unless you're really really hungry, or you just eat more than the average person).  I've tried the Little Italy, The Sonora, and the Ana Bananas Foster.  

The Little Italy is (what I think) like a light calzone or a homemade hotpocket.  You can't go wrong with that if you like Italian food or pizza.  

If you like mexican, The Sonora is a great choice.

The Ana Bananas Foster has a sweet and semi-bitter taste to it (due to the brandy).  It comes with a side of whipped cream.  Fantastic, but I think they put a little bit too much bananas in the crepe.  

Clean bathrooms.  They have a sugar scrub you can try in the bathroom that's also available for sale.",SVcQ8yqaLDmjMwPRDwQPaA,3,3,5,PkiD4Fesjx2j17qZKDkc6A

3388187,2012-11-30,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Our major 'difficulty' was determining whether it merits a 4 or 5 star rating. Based on everything but the dark, indoor decor, it rates 5 out of 5. Our experience was an excellent one. 

1. First, we strongly recommend this crepe restaurant, Crepe Expectations. 

2. We ordered Ana's Banana Fosters and one of their (many) signature dishes, the chorizo crepes, and the taste was - as I see another reviewer writing, 'spot on'. Not much in the world of food beats an original taste. Discovering a restaurant that has an entirely unique, hand-crafted, menu of dishes, is remarkable. The coffee was good, including the decaf, and it was endless.

3. The price range was excellent, unexpectedly reasonable for a small, specialized restaurant. The service - we sat outside - was very good at the ordering point and as it was brought to us in a good time frame, outside. 

4. The menu has a plethora of unique items but remains 'crepe-centric'. It serves a breakfast, brunch and lunch menu, as well as coffee and liquor items.

5. When we were finished, I actually asked to speak to the owner. I had a suspicion it was the gentleman who was ordering some items - and it was. I complimented him on our enjoyable meals and began talking to him about all things crepe and cooking. It was a good conversation. One item in particular (there are several) that he is proud of is that he does not use is a freezer. 

PS - I want to add that although it closes at 3 pm, we were eating and drinking our coffee at 3 pm without any pressure for us to depart. Simply another positive point to mention.",k_eKYlkhI11VGzb5RxHmOA,0,0,4,vrtczzuF602brHVVDHi46Q

We found the place pretty quickly and stepped right in. Very little and cozy restaurant and was super busy. It was so busy I was easily turned off and wanted to head to another restaurant instead but my husband convinced me to stay. We told one of the staff our names and I think they somehow jotted it down either on a piece of scrap paper in someones pocket or they have the memories of an elephant. We waited in a back hallway and tried to figure out what we would eat.

They yelled my name out and we were up and pretty much ran to the cashier to place our order. I ordered The Monkey crepe with nutella, banana, chocolate, and whipped cream and my husband ordered The Monterey with bacon, eggs, tomato, onion, peppers, and cheese. I also ordered the Passion Fruit Mimosa that I read tasted amazing. We were brought to a high table in the corner and they put a number on the table. Nice! I was served the amazing and tasty mimosa that I wanted to gulp down but it tasted so good I wanted to savor each sip (first time I drank alcohol that slowly). While we were waiting I was able to see the television that had live video of them making our crepes. You could also watch them through the glass but there is a table right there and it would seem like you were trying to eat with those people. Finally got our crepes. So nicely presented and so tasty. I love, love, loved it! We were so satisfied and so impressed that the owner/chef came by our table and actually stopped by everyone's table to make sure everything was good. 

I will return to Crepe Expectations when I visit again. Such a nice and welcoming atmosphere and a restaurant that seems like they care about your food quality. Prices were good too. Place for amazing crepes and service.",tuHli40Q0WQdIPjOvklUXA,1,3,5,L3QSy7YiPKaTzo8p4yjuBQ

The usual sin is to offer so many choices it takes ten minutes to file through the selections, some times you even find burgers and sandwiches interlaced among the crepes. No burgers here thankfully, just about ten options for both sweet and savory crepes each ingredient combination well selected.

Service was okay. You order at the register, pay, and get a number, and then take a seat. Your food is then brought out to you when it is ready. There are a few seats right up against the kitchen if you want to watch crepes being made.

The decorations inside gave you a chic feel to it. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful but the owners told us we came after the rush hour. We both talked to the owners and they were really nice. We found out that they make everything in the kitchen fresh every day. They're trying to make their own hummus.

We got the Avalon- omg the goat cheese makes this perfect for people who like sweets but can't have too much sugary stuff, it's to die for. Legit.
The Sunday morning- ask for tapatio at your table to mix in with it, the little bit of spice is perfect.

I got there early, at 11, so I could reserve a table, group meeting was at 11:15 and we knew there'd be a wait. I walked around the parking lot at the ""farmers market"" to kill some time.
By 11:30, everyone was hungry and the owner said he just didn't know when he'd be able to serve us. If one table of 2 opens, they dont hold it for my waiting group, they give it away. We need all 3 tables that are next to each other to miraculously get up and leave at the exact same time. I wish he would have told me this when I called. I had reservations for Paymons but ditched them for this. Urgh!

I had the plain crepe with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream. It was OK. I wanted my crepe nicely browned on both sides but one side was more done than the other.

This cute restaurant is adorned in purple, so how could I not love this place? They offer savory, sweet or breakfast crepes. I have never tried a savory crepe because my sweet tooth always wins the battle but this time, I was determined to try something different.

The cashier recommended The Sonora (Carne Asada Steak, Roasted Tomato Salsa, Guacamole and Jack Cheese) for $9. I love how they have TV screens where you can watch your crepe masterpiece come to life! My crepe was so tasty. The meat was flavorful and there was the right amount of heat. I was so full that my friend and I couldn't order a sweet crepe for dessert like we originally had planned.

They have an amazing beverage selection including champagne, wine and mimosas. I opted for water, and they offer free cucumber or lemon infused water. Perfect touch!

I got The Nutty Classic (Nutella, Fresh Chopped Hazelnuts, Fresh Whipped Cream and Powdered Sugar) to take home to my husband. He LOVED it, especially the fresh chopped hazelnuts. It is definitely a different take than other crepe places that offer the same ol' ingredients.

While we were discussing possibly leaving for somewhere else, the gentleman behind the counter started walking us through the ordering process by asking us things like ""sweet or savory? Spicy or mild? breakfast or lunch?"" until he had the perfect, individualized combo of ingredients to go into the crepe. No backing out now!

We swung by the condiment station to grab some of the lemon and cucumber infused water, and then went outside to sit down.

Food arrived, and was absolutely wonderful. Hot, flavorful, large servings. Crepes come with either banana or cottage cheese, which were both also delicious. I had a spicy chorizo crepe, and it was cheesy and meaty , with just the right amount of spice. Prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food.

Came here one morning and was quite surprised at how cute and quaint this place was.  
Kind of dark inside with frames and curtains on the wall. Decorated like you were in a country home versus a strip mall in Las Vegas.

The man who took my order was very friendly and recommended various items as it was all our 1st times there. 
Funny thing is the 1st thing we ordered were the mimosa samplers. 3 samplers for each of us: guava, blood orange, watermelon, strawberry, grapefruit, coconut, pineapple, and 2 other flavors I can't recall. 
Each flavor was pretty good and infused well with the champagne. Problem was it was giving me the burps before I even got my meal. 

I'm more of into savory crepes kinda gal and the guy recommended the Sonora (asada steak) or the Pirate (albacore tuna) but, I was intrigued by their special of the day, Reuben crepe with the roast beef, sauerkraut, etc... UGH, it was like a sandwich...so. good!!!!! My sandwich, also, came with a chicken tortilla soup. LOVEd it. I'm pretty sure I could have just ordered that and be a happy camper. 
My friends ordered the Marco Polo breakfast crepe (sausage) and another special of the day that had chicken in it. I wish I knew the name as it was quite tasty. So, was the Marco Polo.

This place is so great that I wish I could eat here everyday so I could try a new savory crepe. Exciting flavors! Can't wait to come back!",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,4,5,5,sLlM_ihm6KOus4HXVYS3tA

3698200,2012-12-07,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Such a lovely little place! It is not your typical crepe shop that's decored with white walls and contemporary furniture. This crepe shop has a whole lot of personality that screams black and purple. Its very intimate and romantic (great for sunday brunch dates or coffee shop dates. Wink wink fellas!)

It is a petite shop, and you better believe the seats never stay empty! There is also an outdoor seating area which is a nice spot to have Saturday breakfast when all the cool vintage cars are parked outside. It makes a great start for conversation!

I came with my mom who absolutely adores this place (if my mom is willing to a take a trip down to this area then you know its for a good reason!) 

She ordered the Berry Delight crepe ($7.50) and you get the berry works! It includes blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries with whipped cream on top. Its berry delightful! (Insert drum roll here) If you don't want a sweet and heavy crepe this would be a great option. Its filled with fruit, which won't be filling to your tummy. I picked the Monkey ($6.50). It's a typical choice for me since my favorite crepe includes nutella, bananas, and strawberries. The Monkey has bananas, nutella, and whipped cream. I also added strawberries as an additional ingredient. I intent to come back again, and step outside of the box to try the rest of the menu items. They also have great Savory Menu with crepe items that have pepperoni, spinach, mozarella, tomato ingredients, and more!

Lastly, a great pair with our crepes was the Mimosa Trio Sampler ($10.00) which provides your choice of three various mimosas to taste that you can pick from the menu. Its a perfect sample size especially if you're in it for taste and less on getting crunk in the AM or afternoon. (Fellas this would be a fun option if you bring a date with you! Hint. Hint) We chose the blood orange, guava, and cherry mimosa to sample. My favorite was the blood orange! Filled with a variety flavors on the menu and they are all such original selections. I never knew that there was a variety of ways to make mimosas besides OJ until now!

How fun! You can watch them make your crepe on the tv as well. So you know exactly when your order is coming! It's a great family owned business and they are all so helpful with assisting you in making a decision. They really know how to be welcoming and feel like you're right at home.

3709645,2016-05-03,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Pros: Inexpensive, very very very friendly service, DELICIOUS!
Cons: SMALL restaurant!!! It's worth the wait in my opinion but during peak times (brunch) it can be 1hr+... They do pay very close attention to who will be seated next so you don't have to worry, though. 

I recommend: My favorite is the Grand Turk! So good. Get the soup with it, too. The mimosas are hit or miss (they all taste good, but might not taste like their flavor, ie watermelon just tastes like alcohol to me while peach tastes like peaches)- go for the ""classic"" flavors and you'll be all good.

I always imagined crêpes as being sweet so I was very excited to try a savory crêpe! I tried the Grand Turk the first time I visited... and that's what I get every time now :). I've sneaked a taste of The Sonora and The Monkey from friends, though, and those were also very, very good. It might not sound filling, but a crêpe and a side soup (if you choose a savory one) is actually quite filling! So for around $7-$9, you can have a very happy tummy. 

For busy times where there is a wait, they have a little area in the back with chairs. The host was very conscious to who is next to be seated so you don't have to worry about someone ""stealing"" your spot. Service is always very friendly and attentive. Because the restaurant is quite small, it can get super crowded during peak times. But don't let that deter you from these tasty, tasty crêpes!

The Veggie Patch: It's probably the healthiest and most filling crepe on the menu. It's definitely something for the vegetarians who come here but don't want to eat a sugar loaded crepe. The roasted vegetables had a good smokey flavor and the hummus paired well with it. I'm not sure I'd get it again, but I'm happy a healthy option is available. 

The Avalon: WOW. This crepe has pears, goat cheese, honey, and candied walnuts. Definitely not a healthy option, but amazingly delicious. The honey is incredibly fragrant -- almost like I've never had honey before. I love how savory the goat cheese and is a good combination with the sweet pears.

He let us know the lay of the land and made some recommendations as well. I ended up ordering the vegetable savory crepe and added a couple of eggs to make it a bit more substantial and more of a breakfast-type crepe.

The crepe itself was well made, and with the 2 added eggs, was a perfect portion size for me and came with a side of bananas, cottage cheese, or a third more lunch-y option that I can't remember right now. I also tried my buddy's crepe, which was the bananas foster  option. It was pretty tasty as well--definitely more of a dessert-type option.

I like the setting. There's a nice covered patio area on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. The inside is light, and you can watch the crepes being made through a glass shield. It's a lively place, though a bit small, so it seems like it could get a little noisy.

They have a really good selection of savory and sweet crepes, so depending on your mood, many options. I couldn't decide, so my friend and I decided to split two, The Monterey (which is on the breakfast yumm menu available anytime) it had bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, red onion, serrano peppers and jack cheese. Jackpot!  This was scrumptious! Then we split the Elvis (or was it called Fat Elvis)? Bacon, peanut butter, bananas and caramel. Really? Need I say more? 

Props for having a great beer selection (Chimay anyone)? and they have ginger beer! I LOVE ginger anything. I'm definitely coming back, a long wait won't keep me from this place, just can't come starving like I did previous two times.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,7,3,4,FL8knE8CuWQCi7SkAo1nCw

Since it was morning, I decided it was necessary to get a breakfast crepe and chose the Rosarita

The crepe: nice presentation, looked pretty full. I took my first bite and I thought I was in heaven, it was absolutely amazing. But the more I ate the crepe, I just got tired of it. The ingredients weren't distributed really well so the meat was just getting salty as the guacamole disappeared. I ended up not finishing my crepe because I just got really tired of the taste. 

It came with a side of bananas though, so it helped when the crepe got to be too much. I know everyone talks about the goat cheese, but I just couldn't bring myself to get it. Maybe I'll try it next time!

The waitresses were pretty nice. The coffee is self-serve and it was out when I got it, but there was another waiting to be put out when I asked the waitress. That was a plus for me, considering no coffee would have just made me crankier. 

I enjoyed my experience, but it's not a place I think ""omg I need that now""",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,2,0,3,_qbgtApjS_Y4Ov2JKKxzAg

Pros:
-Staff is very friendly (especially Mike who works the seating and outdoor area)
-Food is very good.  Crepes are delicious and they have all kinds to choose from.   
-Coffee is tasty and smooth
-Large outdoor courtyard is nice

Cons:
-Having to order at a counter (I think full service would be better with this new location.  This worked at the old spot better, but it no longer seems to be working)
-Self serve coffee area (it is not appealing and it is set up poorly.  Plus, the mugs are large and have small handles, making them hard to carry.  Plus, with lots of people and traffic it is dangerous to have people carring huge mugs of coffee around.)
-Large delivery truck with loud engine running the entire time we were eating.  I realize this is not really their fault, but they should tell the driver to make deliveries in the back.  Not enjoyable to be eating your breakfast outside with a giant truck engine running and stinking up the area.)
-Could be a little cleaner.  It is not bad, but I have noticed some cleanliness issues here and there.

My buddy April F. and I went to visit Crepe Expectations on a recent beautiful morning. The staff is very friendly and go above and beyond to make sure your needs are met.

I love that they serve a wide variety of alcohol (beer, wine and bubbly!). It was great to have 5 different flavors of mimosas to choose from (regular orange juice, lychee, passionfruit, white peach, and pomegranate). I highly recommend ordering the sampler ($10) in which you can choose 3 different mimosas.

Now on to the crepes! There were so many varieties of savory, sweet and breakfast crepes. I opted for the Caprese which was tomato, basil, pesto, and mozzarella cheese. It was SUPER YUMMY. I am a savory crepe type of girl and am always disappointed when normal run of the mill crepe places only have 2 or 3 types to choose from. There are over 10 savory types to choose from here! Can't wait to try the Pirate! The crepes run between $5-$10. 

The only downfall is it is far from my side of town. I guess my waistline will thank me for that.

I went to Crepe Expectations today for breakfast.  I looked at the breakfast crepe and decided on the Rosarito although I was tempted to ditch a breakfast crepe and go with sweet.  But, I was good and stayed with the breakfast one.  The Rosarito is filled with chorizo--nicely seasoned with a small kick from the spices, scrambled egg, guacamole, and jack cheese.  With it, I had a very large, tasty cup of coffee.

While waiting for the server to bring your crepe, you can watch them make it on the large flat panel above the cooking stations.  There are three crepe making griddles and the two to the left are shown on the flat panel.

My experience with the good food and with the friendly, helpful staff will assure I'll be back for a dessert crepe.

I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday at 11 am. The place was packed, with a line of people waiting to order and be seated. For a minute I contemplated leaving and finding a less busy place to eat, but we had been talking about trying the crepes (and mimosas!!) here for too long to do that... Besides, that may people willing to wait was almost sure to be a indicator that good things were to come to us if we exercised a little patience. 

The line moved surprisingly quick, we were seated at the 'bar' in front of the crepe making stations about 20 minutes after arrival. The bar is a prime spot to sit.. You get to watch every crepe get made. Based on what we saw, I already know what I will be ordering the next 2-3 times I go in. 

We started out our meal with some of the self-serve cucumber water (love that there is an option other then lemon!) and a mimosa trio. We tried the raspberry (ok), the blood orange (delicious) and my favorite, the nectar of the gods, aka the white peach. I have no idea what kind of bubbly is used at Crêpe Expectations, and I do not claim to be an expert on champagne either...  but these mimosas were some of the tastiest I have ever had. 

On to the grub!! I had the Sunday Morning with bacon added. This crepe slaughters every breakfast burrito I have ever had with regard to taste. It was amazing, the only thing it was lacking was a little salsa, but it was still excellent without it. Since we were debating between sweet and not sweet crepes, my friend and I also split the Berry Delight. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, all super juicy and fresh... with just the right amount of whipped cream. 

Honestly the ONLY thing I can say about Crêpe Expectations that isn't positive is that it's on the small side. With food and service this good, I think they could easily fill an area double, maybe even triple the current size. Regardless, even knowing there may be a wait, I'll be back. And for the days I can't wait, there is always the option of takeout! I look forward to warmer weather, as the outdoor seating looks right up my alley (and they are dog friendly at Crêpe Expectations!!) 5 star, all around amazing place.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,9,10,5,BMIhupVjUD7I5v98LbgM6w

The man behind the counter, was the owner and he was extremely polite, I hate to keep saying cool but that is more descriptive. Very kind, accommodating and wanting you to enjoy his experience. 

The food was unlike anything I've had in a crepe. Check out pictures. Where do you get chorizo and eggs in a crepe with homemade salsa? And where do you get a flight of mimosas with different fresh juices? This place is one of a kind and my wife and I absolutely loved it.

4108169,2016-01-17,6,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"I've had a good track record with Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives experiences. This place hasn't ruined it.

I've passed by Crêpe Expectations quite a bit in the years that I've lived in this town. I finally decided that I should try it after seeing Guy Fieri taste some crepes on his show otherwise known as Triple D, which would make it my my second official show-inspired visit (most of the others having come before Guy visited/bantered/tasted/filmed). When my friend suggested that we stop by after we picked him up from the airport, I was pretty excited.

It was just before 11am on a Sunday, so it was packed. People were already sitting outside, and all of those tables were occupied by the time we left. We waited awkwardly for not more than ten minutes in the seats lining the hallway to the restrooms before the host waved us over to place our orders at the register. Bearded dude from the show was manning the register, but he ended up talking about my hoodie before I could get in a word about the TV segment. That's alright though - it's not super fresh in memory.

However, what was fresh was The Sonora ($9.50), which I'm pretty sure was also featured on the show. It's also popular with my Yelp friends, so I had to try it. The filling was indeed excellent, with a symphony of delicious carne asada, tomato salsa, guacamole, and jack cheese. The greens on the side are dressed to the point of almost being overwhelmingly acidic, but it completes the ubiquitous carne asada flavor if you portion it correctly. I would've liked for them to just throw in in the crepe. Perhaps they'll humor me if I request that next time.

I also tried a couple bites of my friend's The Monterey ($7.85), with bacon, scrambled eggs, red onion, serrano, and jack cheese. It's just breakfast in a crepe, and it's very balanced, not salty as you might fear, and barely any heat if it was indeed at all spicy. I did find it odd that a bowl of thinly sliced banana was served with this crepe though. It doesn't match the flavor profile at all, so I suppose it's just a nice complimentary dessert. Odd though.

Finally, we agreed on sharing an interesting sweet crepe, The Avalon ($7.75). It's a not-too-sweet affair chock-full of sauteed buttered pear, which the goat cheese and honey played really off of. The whipped cream was great and really enriched the crepe. I liked the candied walnuts too, but they were fairly sparse and didn't provide enough crunch overall to balance out the soft slices of pear. That texture became a drag after a few bites.

Aside from that, what really stopped me from going for the full five stars was the crepes. The crepe texture just dies next to all the wet ingredients, and two of the three crepes were torn when served. I'm sure it's not an uncommon occurrence with crepes, but it means that these crepes don't do much except serve as a relatively low-carb vehicle for the ingredients. I came in with expectations that the crepes would be a highlight, but they aren't.

That said, I will definitely return to Crêpe Expectations to try their other menu items. I like what they're doing with their flavors, and the portions are affordable if a bit modest compared to typical breakfast/lunch fare.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,10,4,YqfDI5RLkGC-eNLGqJrnhQ

I was thinking my Nutella crepe would be super sweet so I helped myself to the cucumber water (they also had lemon water) while we were waiting.  The crepe actually wasn't that sweet at all, overall I enjoyed the food, the infused water and the quaint dining room, our cashier was also really nice and knowledgeable which made our entire experience here great.

My significant other and I stopped in on Saturday for a late breakfast.  The decor was modern-which I enjoyed.  They have two projection screen tv's.  Perfect for my guy since the football game was on. (He didn't miss any action)  They also had the crepe cam where you can watch them make your food.

I ordered the Rosarito which had chorizo, avocado, cheese and egg.  It was delicious! I my opinion, the crepe's thickness was perfect. There was so much food stuffed into it, and it didn't break.  The watermelon on the side was a nice fresh touch to my plate.  I also had the pomegranate mimosa which was TO DIE FOR!  I very much appreciate they use the good champagne and not the cheap one.  

He ordered the crepe with egg, cheese and bacon.  It wasn't as stuffed as mine, but he swore it filled him up (which is hard to do, he eats a ton!).  

Lastly, the service was impeccable.  The lady who took our order came by later and asked how our food was.  This experience was so delightful, I took my girlfriend to eat there the next day.

This time I had the Very Berry Crepe.  It was smaller than I expected.  The fruit in the crepe was fresh and not canned, which I liked, but they were rather watery.  This crepe left me still hungry once I finished.

Overall, I would definitely eat here again but most likely order the breakfast crepes unless I was just looking for a desert.",Nbrtdj-ODs-UBCALhYg-AQ,0,0,5,R5sDFmGdbcHMaZT5bzhTDQ

They even have some breakfast crepes available all day for those breakfast lovers out there. 

Walking in, I could immediately tell that there was a lavender theme going on with this place. While being surrounded by these colors was a bit threatening to my masculinity, I was happy to see that they had ESPN playing on the TVs to compensate while I devoured my crepe.

For a light dinner, I went with The Razorback: a savory crepe filled with pork tenderloin, spices, potato, tomato and red onions. It reminded me of a pork tamale, just with a very light and fluffy exterior. The side of ripe diced watermelon that came with the crepe was also a nice touch to complement the meal. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything was artfully prepared, with even a hovering camera above the crepe station so that you can see it all in action.

Their drink menu is just as extensive as their crepes; with wines, spirits and beer to fulfill the alcohol needs; to juices, coffees and teas fit enough to cater to the coffeehouse connoisseur.

Often we have to wait to order and be seated, but it's well worth it and a small space so not surprising in the least for how delicious everything is.

I've tried every breakfast crepe on the menu and my fave is by far the Rosarito - eggs, guac, jack cheese and chorizo folded into a delicious crepe. First, I generally can't stand chorizo, but this is additively delicious and not greasy in the least. Second, I prefer egg whites and that's never an issue to customize as desired. Hubs always gets the vegetarian breakfast one that has potatoes and adds guac. Then, we order some salsa on the side. Never before had I thought of eating savory crepes before here, but they are oh so delicious!

So, the salsa...Mike by now knows hubs well and that he loves spicy so if their not too busy and have hot peppers in back, he has some super spicy salsa whipped up for him. It makes them both happy which is fantastic, and just a nod to the wonderful experience they provide there. I can't recommend Crepe Expectations enough - the crepes are all beyond delicious and the quality and caring service provided by Lou, Mike and the rest of the folks there is wonderful.",xEJrg_LCM4wNp7UGWE5Vfw,0,0,5,cbd127XELgu-y5tIkGEjXg

Crepe Expectations has savory and sweet crepes. The restaurant is the perfect little place to get brunch on a Sunday morning.... as long as you're not going with a huge group of friends or planning on chit chatting for hours. The restaurant is small and busy- they'll have to kick you out if you stay too long!
Sonora: With carne asada, guac, cheese and salsa this tasted like a flattened burrito. It was really good and stuffed full. It wouldn't be my idea of brunch food, but I wouldn't be opposed to ordering it again. The soup that it came with was very tomato-y. Again, it didn't go very well with my mimosa/coffee combo. 
The Monkey: No one can do nutella and banana wrong. The Monkey was sweet and the perfect thing to eat for brunch. 
If you're here with more than one person. Order one sweet, one savory. The savory was a lot more filling, but you won't get that satisfied feeling without the sweet crepe.

It was all light in flavor, no excess anything, which was great. We left feeling nice and full. Nothing was excessively oily, salty or sweet...Perfect for the palate.

I ordered a sweet crepe to take back to the office after lunch which they held off on making until I was almost ready to leave. The man that helps find the tables remembered that my co-worker and I had ordered sweet crepes and offered to get them started as he noticed us finishing up our savory crepes. I was impressed that while checking on all of the tables and greeting everyone that he was so on top of this. Sure enough our crepes arrived right as we were ready to leave. Everything was packaged well and they included silverware. 

The actual crepe was the best crepe I've ever had. The taste was excellent and I loved the way it was prepared. For lunch I had the Sonora which was steak, avocado, salsa, and cheese. It was very tasty and I loved the flavor of the steak inside. My dessert pick was the Perfect Combination which was strawberries, chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. Yum! It was probably enough for two people to share, but I ate the whole thing because it was delicious.

The restaurant isn't huge, but they offer indoor and outdoor seating. It's nice that there is someone to help find tables for you during busy times. The restaurant seemed clean and inviting. I also loved that they have cucumber water and lemon water.

Greek: feta, olives, onions, chicken, spinach, plus a small side salad or soup. This one's a bit messier to eat because nothing will stay intact. 

Avalon: pears, goat cheese, honey, walnuts, side of whipped cream. This one is definitely a dessert crepe and it's pretty sweet.

Asked for my food and a refund for the inconvenience and the waiter told me that's not how it works and I need ""to get in the real world"". Owner just sat there and watched us have an unpleasant experience. No food. No apology. Big waste of time. I was late to work. Thanks Crepe Expectations! First time there and definitely my last. Needless to say I was utterly DISGUSTED with the staff.


Reply: I've been to ""fresh food"" restaurants and it should NEVER take that long to make an omelette and a crepe. I asked for a refund once the food was ready because it was so inconvenient for me. And that doesn't change the fact that your staff was rude and it seems like you're condoning it... nor does it dismiss the fact that people were getting served that got there way after us.

I found out about the opening in the zip code magazine I get in the mail, and bookmarked it forthwith.  I knew that this creperie served crepes on a plate, not hand-held style, but so what?  They serve up YUM!
Even though it was a late lunch for me, I opted for a sweet crepe.  I will definitely need to get back here to try savory and breakfast crepes, but The Avalon called out to me: buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts....
it was amazing!  So was the service.  I was the only one inside (a few brave souls were eating outside) and I had a nice chat with the two ladies working.  I am intrigued by the flavored mimosas and will come back for those (they have a 3 mimosa sampler for $10 or one for $6) - white peach, passion fruit, lychee, traditional, pomegranate. 
This would be a really fun place for me to get the yelpettes of Vegas for a crepe and mimosa brunch before my wedding (so keep your eyes open for that, belles!)
Yes, I will be back...they have guacamole for savory crepes and lemon curd for sweet ones so I have to come back for those options!

Unfortunately, we had to take our crepes to order, but we understood because they were closing soon so it wasn't a big deal. 

We ended up ordering the William Tell crepe (sauteed apples, caramel, powered sugar and whipped cream) and the Berry Delight crepe (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, powered sugar and whipped cream).

While waiting, I noticed some Star Wars decorations so I was taking a photo with my phone when the owner came out. He was super sweet, struck up a conversation and invited me back to see his other decorations and also his signed Guy Fieri poster from Triple D (I hadn't known this restaurant was even on the show!). So that was so neat and he was just so chill and welcoming.

We got our crepes and went on our way. They were delicious! The berries on mine were very fresh and the crepe itself was delicious.

I started off with the mimosa trio. It is comprised of three small glasses of any kinds you choose. I had the orange, blood orange, and passion fruit. The passion fruit was definitely my favorite.  My husband had a glass of the white peach mimosa which was also very tasty. 
We ordered the ""Sunday Morning"" breakfast crepe and added mushrooms to it.  It was a good size and delicious.  For our savory crepe, we had ""The Avalon,"" which was filled with pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey.  It was also delicious.

My breakfast crepe was a Crepelet and was so dry. The eggs and ham were overcooked. The crepe was too thick. If I hadn't had a side of cottage cheese I could not have eaten it. As it was I left half since it was almost burnt inside. 
My husband's crepe, the Rosarita, was only palatable because it had sour crème inside the crepe which made it eatable. His eggs and meat were also overcooked. It seems like they cooked the food up ahead of time and left the ingredients in a warmer for a while until someone ordered. The inside food for the crepes was NOT fresh.
 
The counter service was fine. But with this larger area it seems that the service could be better and have waitresses instead of a counter. The drink counter for the water and coffee were scrunched up on the side. No room to hardly pass by the table. No trays so it was hard to handle the large cups for refills. Maybe it would be better to have paper cups with lids if you are having a drink counter for the hot coffee.

Given the decor I was a little skeptical the place would be pretty expensive but the person behind the register was so welcoming and friendly I would have felt guilty walking out. Good thing we stayed, upon closer inspection the prices were quite reasonable.

My husband orderd the greek crepe which came with either his choice of soup or salad and I ordered the special which was bbq pulled pork with with a side of apple and blue cheese coleslaw. I have lived in Texas and I do love me some slow cooked meat but I am not a fan of bbq sauce. No problem they were more than happy to put it on the side. My husband's crepe was huge, the veggies inside were very fresh and maintained a bit of their crispness. He loved it and said it filled him up, which believe me is no easy feat. My crepe was delicious also, the pulled pork truly did rival what you would find at a good bbq in Texas. The slaw which had intrigued me enough to order the dish did not disappoint. I could have eaten a plate of that by itself.

One of the best things was the free flavored waters they had. Cucumber or lemon. I don't know if they change out the flavorings but I love flavored water and the fact that it was free made the place even more affordable. The place was small and had televisions on Food Network with the sound either very low or off. It was very busy but at no time was it so loud that I had trouble having a conversation with my husband.",pfMmuVgggj14f9bb16IwXw,2,1,5,tKMQKsYPgTrAbZ80PrjVog

4749230,2016-01-02,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"This is our 4th visit to Crepe Expectations, and as usual the food is exceptionally good and the menu is unique and fun. The flavored mimosas are fun and refreshing and the hot chocolate is delicious! So why only 2 stars? While the food is exceptional, the service and experience consistently fail to live up to the same standards. Every visit the same host/waiter seats us and is pushy, doesn't really make eye contact or connect and seems to have a different way of operating the flow of incoming customers, ordering customers and seating customers so you don't know what to expect, he doesn't explain it and he clearly loses his patience when you can't read his mind.

On past visits, we have walked in submitted our name and then ordered food prior to having a table. This resulted in our food getting to us shortly after we were seated. Today, our female friend gave him her name ""Kim"" and he repeatedly called her ""Tim"" even after multiple corrections, not a big deal just odd. Then we went to get in line to order and he rushed over with paper menus and told us we could wait over in the corner. Having been here before, we assumed he meant after we ordered and before we were seated. Evidentially, we were wrong. He rushed back over and insisted we move to the corner as we were in the way. Not politely.  We went and sat down, through somewhat offended by his tone and clear lack of patience. Once our table was ready, he allowed us to order. This meant we waited at least twice as long as normal for our food to come out. 

Once the food arrived, it was so good it almost made up for the poor treatment. 

Then, we completed our meal and our plates were removed. One of us was finishing a drink and he other had run to the restroom, when he appeared again in the same rude, rushed, impatient manner and insisted we leave so he could turn over the table. After tipping 20% on the $25 ticket for 2, I was not impressed in the least.

The food is good, but not good enough to deal with the host/waiter. You need someone with better communication and customer service skills to deal with customers.",WmR1dL2YHr5fdeNjY0YtsQ,2,0,2,-lzQp63jukBI0XEEYCoR1A

Some things you need to know: 
-You pay the cashier and then sit where you want with your number. Sometimes they get so busy they will seat you based on inside/outside preference. 
-Breakfast usually comes with a side of bananas or cottage cheese
Lunch savory crepes come with salad or soup. 
-Free cucumber or lemon water 
-Fun little origami collection you can add to on register
-They advertise specials on the side. Make sure you try them. 


Everything that I have tried has been very good. Sometimes I don't like the guac inside so I will ask for just sliced avocados.

Definitely love the food but for the amount of time you spend waiting is just not worth it in my book. 

Especially with an antsy 3 year old it's almost not worth the money. I could have had a nice crepe whipped up over at IHOP for half the price and half the wait time. Put my order in at 11:22 and it is now 11:45. This is just one wait that is a bit too far stretched for me



I will only come back if this place gets more staff on hand to deal with crowds big and small. 

Actually 

Upon waiting 30 minutes(luckily my mom called so I have the call log to prove my wait time) the owner and server show nothing but disrespect. My daughter finished her apple juice in the waiting period. I noticed other patrons that arrived after me already finished and walking out. If you make a mistake and forget a customer, do your best to make it right. Not argue. If you don't have customers, you don't have a job to go to. Thanks for refilling my daughters juice, it's not like I asked you to comp my meal. Especially for a fresh cooked meal, a smile or some respect to your patrons would be nice. 

One thing I did not like at all was them arguing with me over the damn juice. He had the nerve to shout in front of everyone
""There's always that one person that wants everything for free""
When did the words free or give me anything come out of my mouth. Never. 

So you just lost a patron. Hopefully more people will see true colors of this place and realize there's much better breakfast/brunch spots in town. 

Disrespecting a woman is one thing, but to do it in front of a room full of people is another.

The crepes here are quite delicious, and they have screens so you can watch the crepes being made. Everything tasted really fresh. They have tons of variety, and lots of different drinks too. I got a freshly made strawberry lemonade and a Greek crepe. Everything tastes really fresh and clean, and like a high quality meal. The crepe was stuffed quite full, and by the time I was done eating, so was I.

They also have a lot of different flavors of mimosas, and you can also get a sampler of mimosas and you can try three different flavors.

My one complaint about this place is that it's small and a bit cramped. You order your food at the counter and then you get a number that you put at your table. Problem is, if there are no tables, there's not really a waiting area or anything...so it can get awkward.

My friend and I made it a point to go for breakfast and was happy to see so many selections. We wanted to try a savory one but I was hesitant since I've always had sweet crepes so I picked The Frisco (blueberry & lemon curd) and my friend picked The William Tell(apples & caramel) and we both had the berry lemonade. 
   
    Mine was good they didn't cook the blueberries, which is always nice, instead they just barely warmed up in the beautifully folded crepe. They could have tossed the berries in a lil more lemon curd but the crepe itself was tender and slightly sweet cooked just perfectly and the whipped cream, which they put on the side of crepe how I like instead of on top, was fresh which in my book is always a good thing. My friend's was also very good not too much caramel and her apples cooked perfectly. 
   
    The staff  is great. The owners are very nice welcoming people with a very spunky attitude and are willing to answer any questions and make numerous suggestions. The decor is awesome I love any place that uses a lot of purple and modern touches in their decor and it's nice that they have a few tables outside so you can sit and relax in the nice weather.

Wife got the chorizo & egg w/ avocado (they had official names, but my old brain isn't as young as it once was). Both were fantastic. The guy that took our order (maybe the owner?) was boisterous, charming, and a little over the top - which was nice compared to the bland, expressionless zombies you'll find at most breakfast places. My 2nd favorite part (1st was the superb tastiness) of the whole experience was the big screen TV with a live feed of the griddles. From anywhere in the restaurant you can watch your crepe as it's crafted. Thanks awesome crepe dude for making our bellies so happy.",6aSzjNcB_YutOF4eXESN0w,0,0,5,peSe7zbJ25zzHaYuPbrMfQ

4919136,2018-03-24,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"I've been excited to try Crêpe Expectations since moving to Vegas a few months ago. I had seen Guy Fieri visit on DDD, and was surprised to find that I live so close. SCORE! I've visited a couple times now, each time being better then the last. The crepes are phenomenal and the service as well, lots of friendly faces!
 I've tried both sweet and savory crepes including The Chicken Chili Verde, The Sonoran and The Berry Delight. The savory crepes are served with your choice of a side salad or Fideo soup (Mexican noodle soup) TRY THE FIDEO... it's great! I'll have to admit I favor CE Fideo to my favorite Mexican restaurants. The chicken chili verde crepe was delicious and very filling. Authentic chili verde sauce (green chili pepper/tomatillo think green salsa but cozier... if possible? Mexican Comfort food) typically served with pork I enjoyed the chicken and found it to be not as heavy. Now the Sonoran was DELICIOUS a simple blend of flavors that play so well together. Carne asada(steak), salsa, guacamole and cheese yum! I will definitely order The Sonoran again. It may be my favorite crepe yet! 
Next crepe on my personal must try: The Rosario, love me some chorizo! I'll update after I am able to try. 
I usually order coffee, but another popular choice is the mimosa sampler... which I have also tried. Who doesn't love mimosas?! Is that a trick question? Crepe Expectations goes above and beyond champagne and Oj. They have so many flavors! TRY THEM! My personal favorite is watermelon. But I have yet to try them all so it could change. You get 3 generous sized ""sampler"" mimosas for $10... deal of the century. 
Now with all this great stuff being said, it is usually busy. I've only ever gone on the weekend. But the wait is well worth it. Also, not sure if it is every Sunday or just a particular Sunday of every month but, the plaza (in which Crepe Expectations resides) hosts a farmers market market making choices for parking slim. I was still able to find parking it just took a couple minutes longer and a few more steps to get there. 
I've always enjoyed sitting out on the patio(larger seating area then inside)especially when the weather is nice. 
I'm excited to go again soon and take all of my friends that visit from out of town.. particularly from LA (where the crepes are tiny and over priced) can't believe I forgot to mention the crepes are very fairly priced. And well worth every penny! 
See you soon Crepe Expectations!",SCMkXA12XZfnntPlBlu3aw,0,0,5,__1ScpLlN9f5u3w1Jq3SGA
4926413,2015-07-30,4,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"I had never heard of this place until a week ago when my friend said she had heard great things and we should go.  The very next day, a Saturday, we decided to meet here at noon. I sort of panicked when I arrived because there were so many people obviously waiting to be seated.  I went in to find the host, but before I could get very far in, he found ME and asked how many.  Turns out he is the owner.  I put my name down, and 30 minutes later we had a seat outside.

The outside is basically a tented area on the sidewalk right out front of the restaurant. The heat wasn't too bad until it got later in the afternoon, I started to feel it (or maybe it was the mimosas??).  The inside is very small and packed. You have to order at the counter and then take a number to your table where they will bring you your food and drinks (if you ordered any).  If you want water though, you have to go get it yourself.  

It's a bit of a hassle ordering and getting water. There is a lot of jostling, and squeezing past people and tables and servers and bussers to order your food or to get water.  I wish they would at least serve you water at the table so you didn't have to get up in the middle of your meal to refill your tiny plastic water cup. Also, after we ordered and sat down, it took about 30 minutes for them to bring our food. 

However, the food is so amazing that I'm willing to forgive all of that. I ordered the Sonora crepe, which is carne asada, guacamole, fire roasted salsa and cheese. Everything about this crepe was perfection. The flavors worked so incredibly well together. I could not stop eating even after I was stuffed.  I can't wait to go back and eat it again!  

They also offer mimosa samplers. For $10 you get 3 flavors - my favorite was the strawberry and the guava. Yum!

I visited around 11:30 and there was only space to be seated outside (the space inside is quite small). I did not mind this at all since the weather was really nice. 

I ordered ""The Pirate"" which has a tasty tuna salad inside the crepe with swiss cheese. I thought the bite was very tasty and the portion perfect. I was looking to eat something that would not make me super full because I had a holiday even to go to later in the day. Each crepe comes with a side of soup or salad. I chose the second option which was a Mexican noodle soup. I thought this was tasty, but not amazing. 

Overall, I would def be back to this place! I saw on the menu a sweet crepe ""The Avalon"" which was buttered pears, goat cheese, walnuts and honey that I have a feeling I am really going to like.",e1z9K45idYRUBn7Sps6T1w,1,1,4,HgdTEWU1MbZqUAIcAiN1rA

They do take names and get you set up with seats.. once our table opened up we ended up at the cash register being helped by Lou. Not only was he friendly and informative .. before us he was on a phone call with a difficult customer and handled it like a pro concerning who pours their O.J lol .. 

After we   ordered and then took our seat in front of where they make the crepes .. Where I got to watch Melissa rocking it out making crepes 

As far as our order we opted for the Mimosa Sampler for $10..it's a great deal below are the flavors 

Watermelon, Rasberry and Blood orange were the flavors we went with .. I legit can't wait to go back and drink lots of the watermelon ones lol but they use fresh fruit ..

I've had the fresh squeezed lemonades as well and they rock !!

As far as crepes we got one savory and one sweet 

Marco Polo with added cooked onions was one savory and the sausage is so freaking good and the balance was perfect ...

We opted for the seasonal pumpkin spice cheesecake one which is good if that's your thing but it was almost too much cheesecake not enough spice which i can't believe I'm saying cause I don't like pumpkin spice stuff typically but it's tasty however my favorite sweet one is the Elvis but if you check out the menu or specials at the register ..

Better yet feel free to ask Lou he will hook ya up with good ideas . Plus I guess this is a DDD location cause I just saw a preview for next weeks guys next big project and one of the contestants is at this location ..

As long as you are open to waiting for a seat this is a super affordable place to enjoy a delicious breakfast or brunch .. check it out !!! Come hungry and I'm pretty sure you will leave Happy!!!",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,4,2,5,M6SkzjMKpDBqCjvnfszO4w

I may not be a frequent customer, but when I crave something fast and fresh, this is one of the places I go to. 

The Rosarito
Plain no frills needed. Chorizo that has a nice spice to it and definitely not OILY at all! Guacamole and pepperjack cheese compliments this dish very well.

The Sonora
In place is chorizo, it is their carne asada steak with roasted tomato salsa.

The Monkey
Banana, nutella, chocolate drizzle, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Can't go wrong with this combination. Don't let it fool you! Definitely needs to be shared with a friend, especially if you had their savory crepes.

The Elvis
One of their special dessert crepes not listed on the menu but is written on the board next to the cash register.

4958472,2013-11-14,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"We had breakfast on a Wednesday at Crepe Expectations.  We arrived around 8:55 and waited outside for a few minutes before they opened.  The wife went with the Monterey, which has bacon, egg, peppers, tomato, cheese and onions.  I had the Sunday Morning (eggs, potatoes, cheese) and added bacon.  I'll be honest, I had no idea how big these things were, and I was worried we wouldn't have enough food.  So, we decided to get a William Tell to split.  Plus, we wanted to try one of the sweet ones.

Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These things are HUGE, such a good value for what you get.  We brought nearly half of the wife's home, and that was with me eating some of it.  These come out very hot, which is appreciated.  No sitting around for these crepes, you get them fresh.  I loved mine with hot sauce.  Lots of cheese and crispy bacon.  I probably liked the wife's a little more, the veggies mixed with the eggs became basically like a salsa.  Again, there was a lot of cheese, which is a fantastic thing.  I think in the future I'll get the Monterey and add potatoes, that will probably be the perfect crepe.

The William Tell was fantastic, basically a nice apple pie crepe.  Again, it was enormous, so we didn't finish it.  I loved the caramel and powdered sugar on top.  

After we arrived and ordered, the place got crowded.  Every seat taken and a line out the door.  But, they seemed to get through the people pretty quickly.

My strongly complaint is that the food was inconsistent. The flavors were great the first time and poorly done the second time. I even tried the same dish and it didn't taste the right even though the ingredients seemed the same.  They seemed to vary the amount added to the crepe. 

For me personally, the mimosa suck. I couldn't drink the trio. It's filled with artificial flavors and if you like that... it's perfect. I expected fresh juices but that's not their fault. I think you just need to be aware of it so you can decide if it's what you want. 

Prices are very reasonable but they seem disorganized and need a better system for seating. 

They did a great job with attention to detail... The water is flavored nicely and the worked very hard on the menu.

 It was my mother-in-laws birthday and I knew she would love this place. We placed our orders with the chef. I ordered the Rosarito. My mom-in-law had the Monterey. The other people in my group went with the Ana Bananas Foster. I love that with the savory crepes you can pick from bananas or cottage cheese. Since you pay and then pick your seat we were going to sit outside, but bees started bothering us so we moved inside. Which was great because you can watch the chef on a flat screen tv make your crepes. I really loved that feature. Our crepes came out and were so pretty and even better tasty! My Rosarito had spicy chorizo, guacamole, eggs and cheese. What a great combo. The crepe itself is light and the perfect vessel for just about anything. My mom-in-law really enjoyed hers as well.

As for Crepe Expectations drinks. Get the mimosa sampler! It's three glasses of champagne with your choice of juices! For only $10! I loved the cherry juice. It's a wonderful combo with any of the crepes.

The location has a small dining area with tables outside. If it gets busy, put in your name and they call you when a table is ready, order at the counter and wait to enjoy a tasty meal. 

I started off with a savory crepe, The Sonoma... carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole and jack cheese with a side of soup. Enjoyed every sip and bite of this meal. I had a few bites of my friend's banana foster crepe. Yum! can't go wrong with a classic.

They also offer, bubbly/mimosas and wine by the glass or bottles and a variety of beers. Cheers!

Upon arrival my friend tells me that this location has been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives aka Triple D. I may have caught the episode. Will have to find and watch it again. Service was attentive and friendly as well. I'll be back!",P_GF0rCpPysW5Mskj1L16Q,0,0,4,R2BwOaU47Fb4yTIIbX5buA

They've only been open a couple weeks, but my boss talks about it all the time...so I had to see for myself. The first time I went in, the owners were the ones that greeted me. Friendly, smiling, and welcoming. That's definitely a plus with me. :) 

I told them it was my first time, and they asked me a few questions before offering suggestions on what to try. I was super hungry so I wanted a filling-dinner type of crepe. He suggested The Bomber, w/ pepperoni added. He said you can add whatever you want to the crepe. Awesome. The Bomber has meatball, mozzarella, tomato sauce...and I added pepperoni to it. 

The Bomber was definitely.... da bomb! (haha lame joke. ;) ) 

The crepe is a good size and it comes with a side of fruit. 

My first time there I chatted with the owners and (I didn't ask for it, but they did it anyways) --- they gave me a sit down type of service. Which I appreciated a lot! Maybe I seemed confused my first time there. But the way it's set up, you order at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food to you. Even with that type of service, the owners check up on you to see if you need anything and if your enjoying your meal. I love that! That's what top notch customer service is about! :) 

My 2nd crepe, my awesome bosses ordered us some from here. I had the Sonora. It includes: carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese. It also came with a side of fruit, pineapple. The fruit is different each time. :) Which I enjoy. That was delish as well. 

My 3rd crepe, 2nd time here: I brought my friends along with me. It was nice too see the owners remembered me. :) I ordered the Caprese crepe and Mimosa trio sampler. You can choose 3 out of the 5 flavors available. I chose the lychee, passion fruit, and pomegranate. My FAVE was the lychee mimosa!!! I love lychee.... and I was excited to try that one. It was delicious! I wasn't a fan of the other flavored mimosa, but the lychee was my fave. 

The Caprese was good. Melted mozzarella, tomato and basil. I loved the drizzle of pesto sauce over the crepe. 

I forgot what my friends ordered, but they enjoyed theirs as well. 

By the time we scraped our plates clean, we were soooo full but still managed to order a dessert crepe or rather a ""Sweet Yum."" We couldn't leave here without having one of those. So the three of us shared one. Got the Nutty Classic and added banana and strawberries! It was huge, and delicious! Nutty Classic includes nutella, fresh chopped hazelnuts, whipped cream, powdered sugar...and along with that we added the banana and strawberries! It was heaven! 

I'll have to try their other dessert crepes the next time I come in. 

We all couldn't stop talking about the decor of the place. It's not what you would expect from the outside. Lots of purple, it's hip yet elegant. If you go, you have to check out the bathroom! the decor in there is beautiful as well! 

The prices are not bad, and they have a selection of beer, wine, coffee, waters, juice, etc. Oh they also have two tvs one with the making of your crepe, and one for entertainment.

It's a ways off the strip but we happened to be near here and looking for some good breakfast with gluten free options that was open on New Year's Day and this place was!!  I just love that you can get ANY of the crepes on the menu gluten free!!  That is so awesome.  They have salty crepes and sweet crepes!  They were pretty busy this day so we got the first available table which was outside and took 10 minutes, inside was about 20 minutes.  But they had a nice guy who was seating people and directing.
The cashier was super nice and I like his general demeanor.  Our party ordered a gluten free breakfast crepe, a gluten free classic crepe (nutella), a caprese crepe, and a fruit sweet crepe.  The crepes come with a side order of your choice.  For gluten free crepes, could choose bananas and something else.  The caprese crepe came with a salad.  You can add whipped cream to the sweet ones.  Everyone liked their crepes!  The only thing to mention would be the sweet crepes are really sweet especially the nutella one which is all nutella then powdered sugar then whipped cream and hazelnuts on top.  BUT that is coming from me who doesn't like really sweet stuff but I can see a lot of people loving how sweet it is.
I can't vouch for the non gluten free crepe but my party members said it was really good and it looked good, thin and smooth.  The gluten free crepe tastes like it looks, a bit more on a grainier side and less elasticity then the regular crepe so it breaks apart a little easier but still delicious!  And to have gluten free crepe options is just 5 stars for me!  The breakfast crepe had egg and potatoes and cheese in it.  It was yummy.  I think with the gluten free crepe it was a tad on the dry side, but ketchup fixes that.
Nice servers and free parking in the strip mall lot is always a plus!

Whereas down the street, they're serving Japanese-style crepes - this place is all about the traditional Parisian crepes. 

My brother and I shared the Mimosa Trio and the Frisco crepe. The trio featured a white peach, pomegranate, and lychee mimosa. Lychee was simply to die-for while white peach boasted a bitter taste. On the other hand, the Frisco, adorned with lemon curd, blueberries, and powdered sugar, was orgasmic. Talking to the owner, she said she made everything in-house other than the hummus, and for this, I am impressed. Homemade lemon curd? There's nothing better.

What struck me the most was the ambiance. Enduring the brutal Vegas heat from the parking lot walk, entering Crepe Expectations is a nice, welcomed change.

We went for brunch on Sunday which might have been the first mistake. It was packed, and there is no place to stand during your wait except outside in the heat. It didn't take too long to get seated, but then we had to share one table with 2 other parties which wasn't ideal and kind of awkward.

After we had ordered, it took about 15 minutes for them to bring my husband's diet coke to the table. And you have to go get the water yourself with paper cups. On top of that, it is so full in the tiny location that you bump into a few people just to get to the water.

The worst part is how terribly hot the location is in the summer. People were fanning themselves waiting for food and we were sweating. The staff said that the grills are so hot and the door keeps opening and closing because of the patio that they cannot keep it cool even after having someone check the AC a few times. I guess there is nothing that can be done about it in this location, but it's kind of miserable.

Overall, the food was really good and reasonably priced. But we were so hot, we couldn't even sit there and enjoy it because we just wanted to get to the air conditioning. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. I can find good food somewhere where there is air conditioning and we have our own table.",P_EqkGKaI7-C-jSdm-ZYNw,1,0,2,vG6ETro39_JVtDwqnC_trQ

For crepes, you choose from savory, sweet or breakfast (available all the time) all around $7 a piece, and each one is definitely a meal. The selection makes this the perfect stop for any time of day. I ordered the Monterey which featured bacon, but not because of the bacon. I actually selected it for the serrano pepper. I wanted something with a kick, and I was pleasantly surprised with the nice heat. Every bite was delicious, and it was served with a bowl of juicy, sweet watermelon. Thoughtful touch: they have a video camera installed above the crepe station so you can see your crepe being made from above on a TV screen! It's like a Food Network studio!

But, what I truly adore about this spot are the beverages, including the adult kind. They have at least 6 craft soda pops, a small and tasty beer menu, wines, champagnes and mimosas in five flavors! This really takes brunch to a buzzy level of fun. If you're indecisive, you can get a sampler, but I went with the pomegranate. If I had had a designated driver, I would have had 3 more!

The food is great, and I do think it's a good value if you do not buy all the overpriced beverages. I think the new (current) owner thinks pretty highly of himself-he spent like 15 minutes talking to me at my table (on a non busy day, 2 yrs ago) about how he is a real chef and was going to add menu items, etc. I think that's great (no new notable items have been added since original owner tho), but bottom-line, if you can't care for your loyal customers, in a timely manner, you will ultimately lose your customers.

I visited yesterday, a Tuesday, and arrived/placed my order 9:40 am. I waited 25 minutes to receive my order. The party that ordered after me got their order about 7-10 minutes before me. The couple that ordered before me received their food in less than 15 mins. I had to ask where my order was. The cashier who took my order said she would have to check. It came about 5 minutes after my asking. I ask the person who delivered it, what the delay was. She said they were just really backed up. I asked why the party who ordered after me already had and well on their way to eating half their plates. She said she would need to check. She came back and said it was because they ordered sweet (vs. savory crepe). Not a great reason IMO.

We have tried many places in Vegas,  Quebec, Montreals, Canada. Good selection for sweet creeps and regular breakfast and lunch style crepes. Saw the Greek salad crepes, and look so good. Friendly staffs, clean, and good selection of different water that you have to serve yourself. They put cucumber and lemon in a water pitcher that you can serve yourself. There were one more but does not remember. They are very busy on the weekends according to a staffer. There are line of people waiting. I gave a four instead of five, because you kind of have to serve yourself with water. Not sure if this a restaurant, restaurant or a Starbucks type. They bring you your food at the table. I tip like I would at a restaurant, but you have a server at the restaurant. This is not a big deal.

Already planning to be in the area early Saturday morning, finding a breakfast buddy would prove an easy task and trusting the Henderson local despite the truly lame ""Yum"" menu and ""Have a crepe day"" voicemail I walked into Crepe Expectations with an open mind; the result an hour of gregarious service, great conversation, and some truly Parisian quality crepes.  A bit of an odd space, dim lighting and dark wood beneath big screen televisions orders are placed at the counter and arriving just as the restaurant opened our order of three thin pancakes was expedited on the open kitchen's three stones with each arriving soft on the interior with the slightest browning adding textbook chew enveloping bold, balanced ingredients.  With prices a bit higher than the majority of creperies Stateside or abroad but service and ingredient quality equally elevated it was with a sweet, a savory, and a special that our morning passed and although my tastes veered toward the complexity of the Avalon it would be hard to argue against the Elvis or the Greek, the former pure decadence with added whipped cream and the later finding balance for the slightly oversalted chicken in the punchy yogurt.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,5,4,sTSR_tPzAKzv4x52Api7hA

We stopped by around 1pm and it was a full house. There's a couple tables outside for outdoor dining available but since it was windy we decided to stick with sitting in the inside. 

This place is a fast casual type of restaurant - no waiter service and you pay when you order and then servers bring you the food. Self-serve iced cucumber water and lemon water are available too.  

Bun got the La Jolla (popular among Yelpers) and I got the Caprese. Total was about $14-$15, per crepe is at least $7.50. Both crepes were good but nothing outstanding or extraordinary. The La Jolla comes with the chipotle sauce while the Caprese comes with a Pesto. It's a light breakfast where it'll fill you up if it's the first thing you eat. Unfortunately though, I think all the ingredients for the crepe are all easy ingredients you could probably make it yourself at home - tomato, lettuce, mozzarella cheese. The presentation was pretty basic too - folding it in half then the corners in (I assume having corners faced on the plate would look better but that's just my opinion)

The soup that comes with the crepe, what I think it taste like - top ramen soup powder mixed with water. that's not to say it taste bad because it didn't, but that's just what I can compare its taste to. While sitting at the bar, Bun and I got to see crepes being made - I understand it's delicate and it was weird because there was one employee who tore every other crepe she was making haha

The inside of the restaurant is tight and it was already packed when we got there, so if we wanted to eat inside we would have had to wait.

He made some great suggestions, we placed our order, and were shown to our table with a number.   While in line, I loved watching the crepes being made in the kitchen and there was also a TV you could watch the crepe-making event from LOL.  

The mimosas (we tried pomegranate, raspberry, and orange) were the perfect start to our Sunday.  The Berry Delight and the Sunday Morning crepes were delicious!  The berries were fresh and ripe, and the whipped cream made the ENTIRE meal.  I loved that the Sunday Morning (scrambled eggs, jack cheese, and potatoes) came with a side of sliced bananas (you could opt for cottage cheese instead).

Crepe Expectations lures you in with a play on words, settles you in with boutique decor, and snags you with their divine crepes. My sister and I split the Frisco. A mellow crepe with a thin layer of lemon curd, handfuls of blueberries, a light dusting of powder sugar, and a side of fresh whipped cream. We accompanied this with the mimosa trio. They have five flavors to choose from; pomegranate, lychee, original, passion fruit, and  white peach. We had ordered the first two and the last. The tart acidity of the pomegranate cut the champagne nicely. The lychee had a subtle sweetness, but did not mask the flavor of the alcohol. The white peach was our least favorite. From start to finish it was bitter. I wished my sister would have been honest when the owner asked us, but after she said everything was delicious, it was too late. 

I appreciated that the owner took the time to come out and talk to us. Asking how we heard about the place. Stalking Yelp sure does pay off. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff are polite. The prices are mid range compared to other crepe places. Everything is made in house except for the hummus. You can definitely taste the freshness in their ingredients.

I'm a total sucker for breakfast & bubbles!  All of the crepes are priced from $5.50-10.  Upon entry you immediately notice the intimate environment.  There are not a lot of tables and they fill quickly.  Don't worry though, they make sure every guest gets a table, no work required on your part.

Their crepes are packed full of top quality ingredients, actually bursting might be a better way to say it,  Normally when I think of crepes, I think of something much smaller.  These are more like the size of a burrito.  Being the unapologetic carnivore that I am, I ordered the Sonora, which comes packed with carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guac, & jack cheese that came with a cup of fideo soup.  The steak was tender & flavorful, and most importantly NOT overcooked with a generous portion equally distributed throughout.  Boyfriend opted for the Ana Bananas Foster, which is just like it sounds with powdered sugar on top and whip cream on the side.

We visited on a Sunday morning, and it was totally hopping.  Despite the rush they sat us down immediately, and served up our bottle of champagne pretty quickly.  Due to the high demand and only 2 crepe chefs, it took a little while to get our order.  But we were happy chillaxing with our champagne together.  Plus the have live crepe cameras, so you can watch them cooking up the yum.  This really gave me an appreciation for the fact that they're cooking each order totally fresh and just for you.

Super bonus points for self serve fresh cucumber and lemon waters.  So simple, yet refreshing and luxurious.  They also offer some custom sodas for order.  Boyfriend is originally from RI, so he got really excited to see Birch Beer on the menu.   

I will be back very soon, and when I return I'm dying to try one of these: the Greek, Del Mar, or the Avalon.

I picked a sweet crepe, I got the Berry Delight, made with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, fresh whipped cream, and a light sprinkle of powder sugar.  It was yummy!  The berries were plumb and sweet, the crepe itself was delicious.

I would love to take another look at the entire menu and maybe try something other than sweet, I don't think they have a slow time, but I think that's what it's going to take for me to review everything the offer.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,0,4,sNrLlH64Q_MjGWWk2UiLQw

I was looking to have a not so heavy breakfast with my friend Ian A. and decided to buy some donuts, then he suggested Crêpe Expectations. I've had Crepes before but early in the morning was a bit unusual for me. It's located in a strip mall and offers patio seating where you can enjoy the sunny skies of Las Vegas while enjoying the savory goodness. 

Checking the menu, I decided to go with a dessert Crepe instead of breakfast. 

I ordered, ""The Perfect Combination"" - $7.50:

+Fresh Strawberries
+Chocolate Drizzle
+Fresh Whipped Cream
+Powdered Sugar

For my drink, I ordered the, ""Mixed Berry Fuzed"" - $2.00   The best thing about the drink was it was bottomless and tasted very refreshing. The place was packed so we couldn't find any open patio seats, so indoors it was. It just shows how popular Crepe Expectations is, just like In n Out (Burger Wise), this place has a staple with my sweet tooth!",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,3,3,5,jpK7k0EcEhQ5_dZaj1PCtA

Walking in, my mother and I looked over the menu to see what interested us. The lady running the register was also helpful and told us some of the great selections they had. We ending up ordering three crepes: the special Lou's BBQ crepe, the Sonora crepe, and the Monkey crepe. I also ended up ordering a Chamomile tea.
As we were trying to find a place to sit, the inside can use a little bit of fixing up. But it looked pretty decent. I also noticed a few flies flying around that may not make the place so attractive. We sat down near the area where the water and coffees were. The table was a little wobbly the staff was nice enough to fix it for us.
As the worker brought out my tea, I was highly disappointed when I saw a pot of hot water and a tea bag. For $4.35 for tea, I was honestly expecting more. I can buy a box of tea bags at the store for that amount of water and boil some hot water at home. The plate where the cup for the tea was on was also dirty which was really unappetizing to look at. Even if its only for the tea, there should be no excuse for having it on a dirty plate.
About 8 or 10 minutes, our crepes came out. As soon as the food came out, I noticed that there was a hair in the salad that came with one of the crepes. I know things like this happened in any restaurant so it wasn't a big issue for me since they were also kind enough to replace it. They looked pretty delicious. I liked the flavor of both the Lou's BBQ crepe and the Sonora. My only complaint was that the meat was a little tough for me and my mom to eat on the Sonora which made us like the Lou's BBQ crepe a little better.
After finishing both crepes, they then brought out the Monkey, which was probably the highlight for our meals. I'm a huge fan of sweet crepes so I really did enjoy this one. If you love nutella with bananas and strawberry; I definitely recommend this one. 
Overall, service and food was good. They can maybe do something to change the tea or just lower the price for a tea bag and hot water. My experience was decent but I'm not sure if it was good enough for me to come back.",OKIU4flGD2fACF5EsplXeA,1,0,2,8THnJxpSgQVcR6T5JfUG8g

1) It is SO difficult to find a crepe place that isn't on the strip.
2) If you do find one, it's more dessert crepes.

This place does it all.  We went for brunch and had DELICIOUS crepes. I had the La Jolla crepe (bacon, lettuce, tomato, guac, and chipotle mayo) and it was UH-Mazing.  I was also stoked that I could order a mimosa! I had one with pineapple juice instead of orange. They serve all different juice blends as well! 

Even their water is yummy- infused with lemon and cucumber.  Refreshing!

So the other thing that was great was the service.  They are all so friendly and easygoing.  I'm pretty sure it was one of the owners that waited on us. Nice to see a place that cares about their guests.

Their menu is extensive with different kinds of crepes. From savory to sweet. We ordered one from the breakfast crepe category and one from the sweet, as a dessert.

Rosarito (from the breakfast menu but is served all day):
STUFFING has chorizo, scrambled egg, guacamole, and jack cheese in it. Generous amount of chorizo but NOT GREASY! Loved it, flavorful too... the crepe wrap itself has the best consistency, not too dry and not too soggy.

Nutty Classic:
STUFFING nutella, fresh hazelnuts, whipped cream, sliced banana. Who doesn't like nutella and hazelnuts? With the sliced banana and yummy wrap, they can't make it a more perfect sweet crepe!

They also have mimosa trio sampler, I tried water melon, pomegranate, passion fruit, blood orange, white peach, and blackberry... my personal favorite was the water melon.",9gE3SbLNfL5z9qntDkhI8A,3,1,5,o_Mgp_qSwkr9VxshV1pRZg
5586806,2011-08-01,2,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"Lazy Sunday morning and my refrigerator had nothing I could or would eat... so I called Mom and asked her if she'd like to join me for lunch. I said I wanted to check this place out after my friends raved about it. We made a date and, voila, dejeuner!

Straight to the good stuff: Crepes!

As it says on my profile... I don't eat much, but I eat well. That's also the best excuse *ever* to order too much and, if needed, send it home with Mom. ;)

Savory: The Caprese (extra pesto, please!). The mozzarella was fresh and creamy, the tomatoes firm and bright and sweetly tangy, the basil was sweet and fragrant, and the pesto was... 

.
.
.

... oh, uh, my apologies... I was daydreaming about the pesto. Thicker than some pestos, the flavors were deep - nutty, cheesy, garlicky, basily (are these words?!) - *without* being heavy or oily. Absolutely on my faves list now.

Savory: The Grand Turk. Tender, tender turkey makes this crepe fantastic. The other ingredients: guacamole, olives, cheese, are great accompaniments, yes, but the Grand Turk is not just named for it's protein base, but truly because the turkey shines. Sauteed, it has a smokey roasted/grilled taste that really makes it stand out.

Sweet: The Avalon. Sauteed, buttered pears, walnuts, honey, and goat cheese. An amazing combination that ends up just sweet enough. The nuts and cheese keep the honey and pears perfectly balanced. I had only one wish, and I expressed this to Ana when she stopped over to chat, was that it had more of the goat cheese and the creamy tang that it imparts into the dish.

Sweet: The Frisco. Blueberries and lemon curd. One bite and Mom just smiled with that ""oh, yes, my mouth is happy"" look that she gets over good food. I loved the freshness of the berries, that ripeness that brings a perfectly sweet/tart juicy bite. Add the zest of an amazing lemon curd? Fab, fab dish! Ana even took the time to talk to us about how she worked through the dish to perfect it, and shared some ideas on lemon curd outside of the crepes! 

I mention a lot that I don't eat bread, rice, potatoes or pastas but for a small bite here and there. So, I can admit to leaving way more crepe behind on the plate than should be legal. That said, I *do* taste things, and I had quite a few tastes of the crepes themselves, not just the amazing filling. Light batter that packs a great flavor, perfectly griddled, and even consistency are important in a crepe. Crepe Expectations has got this hands down and, dare I say it, easily rivaling my favorite little spot in Seattle's Pike Market.

Add to all of this the lemon and cucumber waters (cool, tasty without being overpowering, and oh-so-refreshing!), the large menu of libations (coffees, teas, juices, wines... so many options!), there is something for every person (and to complement every crepe!).

The service is phenomenal. Larry and Ana know what customer service means. They will chat you up if you want to chat, share their experiences, and truly try to get to know you. Much like I try to never meet a stranger, they easily make friends of their customers. The rest of the staff is friendly, fast-moving but laid back, and the whole of the experience is inviting.

Something else I noticed: From posted signs (no smoking! wash your hands!) to the artwork, to the light switches to the bathroom lighting: everything is coordinated, put together with purpose, and cohesive. 

With that kind of attention to detail, plus the amazing food and the stellar service, this is easily on my Must Go Often And Bring Everyone Here list.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,4,1,5,6eTQhm7FkiVV3jFLEz8t8g

Everything on the menu looked great, and we eventually decided to share a savory breakfast crepe and and a sweet crepe. The Rosarito is a delicious blend of chorizo, scrambled egg, guacamole and jack cheese, and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes their food with a little kick. We followed it up with the Berry Delight, which is as delightful as it sounds.

We ordered the Avalon, the Nutty Classic, the Monterey, the Perfect Combination, and the William Tell.

The Avalon was so satisfying! It was probably my favorite of the bunch. The goat cheese provided a level of complex flavors that I thoroughly enjoyed. The William Tell was definitely good, but I did not enjoy the apples as much as the pears in the Avalon. The perfect combination was just that - strawberries and chocolate. The Nutty Classic was overwhelming with all of the Nutella, but it was good for the kids. The Monterey was delicious! I usually don't like savory crepes but I made an exception with this one.

5659852,2011-07-23,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"My experience with crepes has always been of the homemade variety - en masse. I used to make and sell crepes stuffed with Nutella or jam to fund raise for the high school French Club that I was apart of. That said, I had my ""commercial crepe"" cherry (?) popped at Lisa L's bachelorette brunch UYE today (7/23/11.)

I was 12 minutes late because I had the fantastic idea to just walk the almost 3 miles to the restaurant, so everybody had already ordered by the time I got there. I ordered a bottle of Pelligrino ($3,) because it was hot on that walk, and the La Jolla crepe with a side of watermelon ($7.) I admit, I had looked over their menu the night before online, so I already knew what I was going to order. I wanted to go with something I couldn't/wouldn't usually make at home myself, so the chipotle mayo is what sold me. 

There was a line formed at the register and it took more than 20 minutes for my crepe to come to the table after I ordered, so everybody had already finished eating by the time I got my crepe. Oh well, we had bachelorette Ad-libs to do and MIL stories to trade while I ate and everyone drank their mimosas. 

After taking my first bite, I can say that the taste exceeded my crepe expectations! It was pretty good, and was like a better version of a burrito (aka, not a thick wrapper or full of beans or rice!) The watermelon was sweet and juicy, not under ripe like most restaurant watermelon. 

Overall, I had a great afternoon with 3 other southern yelpettes (Misti Y, Blair B, Lisa L) and one soon-to-be yelpette. I will return!

An aside: Looking at the Web site, the menu is difficult to find in the jumble of information posted all over the page. As well, the ""justification"" for catering prices is off-putting and is unnecessary. Streamlining the Web site, faster turn around for making/delivering a crepe, and making sure utensils are delivered with the crepe would bump this up to 4 stars - fan worthy food!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,3,EULvjax33LANv3eJWjEjOg

2 words... The Avalon... Perfectly sweet from the pear, crunchy from the walnuts and savory from the goat cheese. This is my absolute favorite! When I left I talked about this crepe for like 3 days straight not missing an opportunity to tell everyone I came in contact with about it. 

Today I tried the Caprese w/ chicken and it was excellen, maybe a little pesto-ie... (Still not as good as the Avalon!) My guy had the Marco Pollo for the second time so I'm assuming he really enjoyed that. 

The first time we went I asked for the Mimosa trio. I thought, what could be better than an assortment of flavored Mimosa's! But sadly I was wrong. The flavors were like flavor shots which made the mimosa's entirely too sweet. 
Today I opted for a traditional mimosa which was much better. 

The only thing negative about this place is that it tends to get busy and you can get stuck with a 30 min wait, but... It's pretty worth it.",9xlwSCtOABq2CuzY_REQpw,2,1,4,2ntqyuJUXHbqeKSvrlfd3Q

We both went with sweet crepes - Avalon for me, Ana bananas Foster for my friend. The Avalon is actually what brought me in the door - can't go wrong with pears (canned, but cooked to order on the stove with butter), goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey. It was delish.... crepe was light and not too sweet, and you could taste each individual ingredient. 
I tried the Ana bananas Foster too - it was good but a little too banana for me. My friend loved it. 
We also shared the mimosa tasting with lychee, white peach and pom. The white peach was our least fav, we just weren't feelin it. Lychee was great and went perfectly with our sweet fruity crepes. We also liked the pom, but not necessarily paired with the crepes. It was a good deal for $10 but note that they're cute little tasting glasses, not 3 full sized wine glasses as it kind of looks in the pic someone posted.

The Mimosa selection is plentiful and I'm looking forward to trying it when I return on Sunday.  As was the coffee selection!

Let's get down to the crepes since that's what you are here for!!  I had the ? with walnuts, pears and goat cheese.  It came with a side of whip cream which I thought was strange up until the moment I tried it and found it complicated the crepe extremely well.  The crepe itself was delicious.  The selected ingredients were good but I would definitely try a different selection before I made my way back to this one.  My kids had the berry one, LOVED it and my son had the Perfect Combination which I know he loved when I saw him licking the plate.

Come with an appetite because these crepes are huge!!  The homemade Strawberry Lemonade was the best I ever had!  Watch your crepe being made on the TV!!  Free Lemon water and free cucumber water!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,0,0,5,wNfoEkmPDfQA5xuLKlB1Og

Three things to just tickle my fancies and by fancies I mean my tummy. 
The Rosarito consisted of a chorizo based crepe with salsa 
The Monkey with bananas as the sweet and lots of whipped cream on the side. 

My line of vision was eyeing the Vanilla Latte, but was redirected to the ""specialty"" lattes board where we ordered two lattes which we forgot the names of, but definitely did its job ;]

We also ordered orange juice which was a nice sweet and was not too tangy or sour.

I had Crêpe Expectations for this place! As for the actual experience? Not so great.

Now that I've gotten my bad pun out of the way, I want to talk about the food. Specifically, the sweet crepes we ordered, The Berry Delight and The Perfect Combination.

Both crepes left something more to be desired. The crêpe batter texture was too eggy for my taste and didn't have any flavor probably so it could be used to make sweet and savory. Plus, both crêpes were torn. RIP. As for the toppings, it couldn't salvage our meal either. The whipped cream was nothing notable, but the berries were sour. And since it was loaded up, it made the crepe soggy and limp. Two words you never want to describe your food with. Plus, the excessive amount of chocolate drizzle on The Perfect Combination only drowned it further.

I mean, maybe the girl working was still learning, and we were unlucky in choosing less than ideal meals, but that doesn't change that the crepe itself didn't have the right texture or flavor. For me, anyways, I'm obviously in the minority. The price is decent, the portions are good, and the food is edible but that's not enough when I've had way better for the same price elsewhere. 

Overall, I left unsatisfied and disappointed, and I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. If you come to Crêpe Expectations, keep your expectations low and avoid the sweets menu.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,4,2,3,tr5HjRlPVlcA5-zgTSBpJQ

I was previously a worker at a crepe shop so I understand why it takes forever for crepes to come out and maybe sometimes in different orders. Of course, this is something that can always be fixed. If you plan on eating somewhere on a short time crunch, this is not the place to go. Practice some patience, will ya?

Their crepes, both savory and sweet, are DELICIOUS. The crepe is cooked so well, it's soft and almost melts in your mouth. I have tried a bunch of different crepes, and depending on what YOU like, you will love it. My favorites were the carne asada and the nutella banana and strawberry. They always hook me up with whipped cream too!

The owners are super nice and it is quite small, yet demanding, so people just need to be aware of the wait times. You gotta wait for good stuff sometimes.

Definitely a place you should try out!

5924317,2012-11-08,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"This place is just spot-on in so many ways...

The decor is pleasant and unexpected with a personality all its own (and no country or breakfast theme -- man I hate ""barnyard"" decor).

The owners are sweethearts (Lou took my order today with an enthusiastic ""Talk to me, Goose!"" and tends to refer to everyone in terms of endearment).

The drink selection is impressive (premium sodas, beers, wines, coffee/espresso drinks, and at least 13 flavors of mimosas -- my favorites are passion fruit, guava, and blood orange).

The food is just awesome, no other way to describe it. I used to think I hated crepes, but this place has made a believer out of me. I can't vouch for the sweet ones since I'm not a sweets person, but the savory & breakfast crepes are effing genius. My favorites are the Sonora (carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese) and the Monterey (bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, red onion, serrano pepper, jack cheese). If you get a breakfast crepe, you can choose sliced bananas or cottage cheese as your side. If you get a savory/lunch crepe, you can choose soup (usually fideo) or a green salad with vinaigrette. Don't let that description fool you into thinking the salad is boring, though -- the dressing is homemade by Lou and has a base of cumin, lime, & garlic (my kind of dressing!!). OMGYUM.

I heard they're looking to open another location on the other side of town. As long as this one doesn't go anywhere, that's allllll right with me.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,0,5,Jnf1d4p_oKNuT-0cyM44pg

5938018,2013-12-08,0,HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,"So we drove across town to try this place out. We had 2 crepes a fresh squeezed OJ and a hot chocolate.

The decor is nice and you can even watch them create your tasty creation of batter and sugary sweets on the monitor above the crepe station!

First the hot chocolate came out. Soooo goood!!! Amazing and tasty!

Then the OJ came out. It was definitely not fresh squeezed. Maybe due to the fact they were closing they would just rush the order and give me the juice from the jug. The lady at the register mentioned that they have fresh squeezed OJ or some from the jug so this lead me to believe they gave me juggy OJ. Not cool. I wasn't in the mood to create a hassle about it though.

Then the crepes came out. The clucker was ok. It was good, but it didn't make me believe I was eating a crepe. It was bulky and the egg and meat just overpowered the actual crepe. You couldn't really enjoy it as a crepe. It was more of a a standard breakfast plate. 

The Elvis though! Oh man this was excellent! I added Nutella to it which made it even more epic!! If we just had this if give the place 4 stars! The bacon and banana and peanut butter and Nutella was just great! To top it off it was smothered in caramel! Sooooo gooood!! A must try! 

I'm giving this place 3 stars. The fresh squeezed orange juice wasn't great and the clucker wasn't our idea if a crepe. The hot chocolate and Elvis was great though. 2 out of 4. Not bad, not great.

First things first...the drinks.  They do a mimosa sampler with choices of like 11 flavors.  They are delicious and reasonably priced.

The crepes....well, you can see for yourself as they make them right in front of you.  They are incredible.  They have sweet/dessert ones, and more savory meat/veggies ones as well.  I believe mine was the ""Monte Carlo"", which was sausage egg and cheese and ""The Perfect Combination"" which was strawberries, chocolate and whip cream.

I love how the menu is split into sweet, savory, and breakfast crepes - I had a hard time deciding what to order! I settled on the Sunday morning, a breakfast crepe with eggs, potatoes, and cheese. It was huge and just stuffed to the brim with ingredients. It was delicious and I had a hard time finishing it all!  I also got a vanilla latte. The latte was just OK, but I've been spoiled by Sunrise Coffee's lattes so it's hard to compete with those. And as an extra treat to myself, I ordered a sweet crepe, the avalon which has pears, goat cheese, and candied walnuts in it. My girlfriends and I split that one. It was light but still filling. It has a great combination of ingredients that go well together and satisfy a light sweet tooth.

Lou was our cashier and was incredibly friendly and informative. You can tell he really took pride in the restaurant and in the food, which translated in how delicious the food tasted!
