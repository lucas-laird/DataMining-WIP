The food is good, but I think it is overpriced for what you get.  You are definitely paying for the atmosphere, which is great so makes it worth it.  They have a very nice bar area so if you don't want to splurge on dinner go have a drink or two at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere and all of the good-looking people coming in and out.",eCKw1eIZsx9nSr0fk23cVA,0,0,4,NK734sGf-T6ePyjPs0Dnmg

This restaurant is excellent in every way, ranging from the decor to the food all the way to the personalities of the staff. A+ 

we started with one of my favorite vegetables ... the beet and lobster salad.. it was presented wonderfully and every beet with the gentle squeeze of your jaw would bust open in your mouth and all I wanted was a bowl of the beets, the lobster was just an added bonus!!! 

the angolotti was completely amazing...  stuffed with rocotta and the truffle sauce were the perfect dish in the middle of the amazing entrees. great pasta.. can't wait to try the other pastas on the hot appetizers portion.  

the entrees, we had the john dory and veal milanese... john dory was good...  it was cooked well and flavorful ....  the VEAL MILANESE WAS DELICIOUS, SO DELCIIOUS.... put the riveria greens on the plate with the veal milanese... and at the end of dinner.... i asked the manager if i would get asked to leave if i sucked on the bone.... which i did and i got to stay for desert!!.... the panicotta  was great... so tasty!... you have to go ... after you eat . you thank god your alive",suVxdEltvmkuoEQqnxA5cQ,1,0,5,ZAIINxROsYFl-lNiL-Yegg

One of the best aspects was their treatment of my wife who has food allergies. She was given a special menu which lists what you can order if you have certain allergies. At every course, our waiter--David Saunders, who gave us impeccable service--made note of how the particular dish was prepared. At many restaurants, if you have a food allergy you are treated as if you are a bother. This certainly wasn't the case here.

For our entrees, my wife had the Cioppino and I had Bistecca. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had.

I recommend the Sinatra Smash, if you want a mixed drink. It's delicious.

I would've probably rated this place a 4.5 if that option was available.  Only reason for the 1/2 point is because the pricing there was a little steep for the amount of food you get.  Although, even for the small portions, my family and I were still not able to finish it all.  Leftovers were delicious the 2nd day though! 

I definitely do recommend saving room for their dessert.  Had probably one of the best tiramisu's I've ever had in my entire life, and definitely the best gellato ever!  I think hazlenut flavor was my favorite, but they're all amazingly good.  The flavors were powerful and busted inside the mouth with every bite.  Pricing for desserts seemed fair for the type of restaurant this was.

Service was excellent.  We had a waitress with a bubbly personality (but I didn't catch her name).  She was extremely friendly, had a great sense of humor, and checked in with us frequently without being annoying about it.

Everything about the experience was first class. From the greeting and seating by the manager, to the sommelier, to the to-die-for food, and our favorite bottle of Domaine Ott Rose (they only had one bottle left...and we shared a bit with our server), we've been dreaming about this place since we left. The polenta sticks were crispy outside and creamy inside, and the meat sauce accompanying them put food I've had in Italy to shame. The second pasta dish we chose was a special that evening of tagliatelle with brown butter and black truffles that were shaved over the dish in front of us. I swear, the poor dog or hog that had to sniff out this truffle would have been dejected had he seen how much we were given.

Again, the strip is over-saturated with chains and mediocrity as we all know, but Sinatra was a complete departure from either. Romantic, classy, and well-executed...that is the Sinatra experience. We'll see you in two weeks!",1sWJj4T2UvggFDSi3K7qtw,1,0,5,hqlesRyNQGsiB1DCjy2SkQ

Appetizers were delicious - Carpaccio, Cappesante, Polpettine all good. 
The Pasta selections, solid - Pappardelle, Ravioli, Chiarra - out of this world. 
Entre- You like Veal? My Way or Milanese are good, you don't even need a knife for the Ossobuco -like butter. Pesci - just pick something and eat already. 
A couple of plates of Bomboloni for dessert -and the best cup of coffee I have ever had in Las Vegas.

Service is solid, portions are decent but up sells on small items, like a ""side"" of a 1/2 cup soggy spaghetti in meat sauce for $10 was silly, and mediocre at best. Like most places in Vegas these days they are not providing what you'd expect for the money. Passable, but not worth a special visit by any means.

   Good music and what else? Good food and even better to be in the Encore.
   My partner works at the Wynn so we decided on a dinner after Valentines day to ease the congestion of the typical dinner on a Sunday. A Monday is good.
   Appetizer: tuna was good half way though I realize it was missing something and I was staring at it; the spiced olive/pickle that was fanned out added the perfect punch to the relishy chopped mix. 
   Ossobuco: never had it before and Frank(partner)(yes how ironic the name), had it. What I expected; soft and tender.meaty great yummy sauce thicker than what I envisioned. The risotto a nice touch with it. Great dish but would be better with a more onion punch. I'm Asian born in Cali so I like strong flavor. 
   I had the Rombo ; read reviews about it . I had to try it for myself I loved it and savores every bite. A soft white fish with a buttersquash and the nuttyness of what I called truffle oil? I asked the waiter and he said yes it's in the dish. I loved it delicate, but exotic and just could not help, but the flavor kept making me smile. Try it I dare you guys can't help but smile when enjoying this dish.
  We were full but our waiter nicely brought out tiramisu and said ""just a taste"" well it was good. Yummy a nice flavor not as soggy as other reviews say. Not too rich and not too light very good chocolate and cream was fantastic.
   Yes I would cone back for a different appetizer, I would get my rombo again. And loved tiramisu but I like trying new things. Beautiful restaurant, nice furniture and view by the patio. We were once again the youngest ones there so don't  be fooled by age. We gave our waiter a 28% tip.",wC4xpodmp16tX9f__3LKPw,0,1,5,J8EOSvjn-LIe-yMwx4UciQ
400258,2009-12-09,0,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"Like one of the reviewers we went to Sinatra's for a special event, our wedding anniversary. I had researched restaurants and Sinatra's came highly to us.  My mom came with us to celebrate her birthday.

We were greeted and given a handwritten card wishing us Happy Anniversary.  Everyone is right when they say the surroundings are elegant and Frank's music serenades you.  My mom and I had decided to split the butternut squash ravioli.  We had been out at several restaurants where the servings had been large so we thought it would be a great way to try a dish and save room for dessert.  

Our waiter was not personable and fairly aloof. He didn't make suggestions on food or wine and just shortly answered our questions.  Like a previous reviewer, we felt overlooked.  The restaurant was not busy for a Monday night and we observed three managers moving among the tables.  Not one came over to greet us or ask how we were.  I ordered a glass of wine and Pasta Fagoli soup which I would describe as watery broth with beans, tomatoes and pasta. Just not much taste to it.

We received our main entrees and I looked down to see that our split meal consisted of about 4-5 small ravioli for myself and my mom. I mean they were small.  My husband's lobster risotto tasted great and he shared with us. The ravioli was average and nothing to write home about.

Not once did our waiter return to ask how our meal was or if I wanted another glass of wine.  I'm not one to complain but I know when people take a genuine interest in you being in there restaurant.

Our dirty dishes sat in front of us for over 20 minutes as various staff walked by. We finally stopped someone to remove our plates.  Our waiter showed more interest in the large table nearby and finally came over to ask about dessert.

I wasn't asking for a free dessert for our anniversary but like another reviewer said, we had eaten at Botero (another Encore restaurant) and had received better service plus a cute dessert for our anniversary.

Our tiramisu at Sinatra's was good and standard.  Nothing extraordinary.  Our waiter never came over again to inquire if we wanted anything else.  I was mostly sad as I had wanted a special night for us.  A little warmth and personality goes a long way towards good customer services.  With being laid off recently, I could have spent more, but $200 for a mediocre evening was not what I had envisioned.",mphGoKZXcIeph59pV0eM7A,1,0,2,tjRwQiWRg1x_mPxLKeHxWQ

And this particular evening at Sinatra was just that. ""To me, this is magic,"" said my Dad, a rabid Sinatra fan, who requested we dine here for a special dinner during his visit this weekend. He loves good food but isn't really a foodie per se, so we don't do many fine dining meals when it's just him and Mom isn't with us. So, I confess  -- although I love Wynn and Encore-- I was a tiny bit skeptical about his choice since we hadn't planned on a really elaborate dinner during this visit. Although I'd met the chef -- the brilliant and charming Theo Schoenegger -- and knew he was extraordinary I was concerned the menu items might a bit rich and heavy for my current palate/diet. I was also concerned it would be crazy expensive, and Dad insisted on treating.  I'm thrilled to report I was dead wrong! We had an amazing evening and ordered from the special summer menu (3 courses for $69) We even found a fabulous bottle of wine for under $40 - which was a pleasant surprise. (Loved Drew, the wine manager!) Dina, our server, has been there since the restaurant opened and she made our dining experience incredibly enjoyable - perfectly paced. She was very accommodating to a couple of special requests I had, such as ordering sauces/dressings on the side for my fish and salad. The bread basket was a standout.  I rarely do bread, but the cheese breadsticks were particularly amazing. Dad opted for the Osso Bucco, a caprese salad and panna cotta with fruit for his dessert. He said the veal was the best he's ever had. Husband ordered a filet, a crab appetizer salad and tiramasu for dessert. All outstanding. He's not even a mashed potato fan but loved the potatoes served with his steak. I had the fish special with asparagus, sauce on the side, and a salad appetizer. All awesome. For dessert I opted for the coconut sorbet with fruit from the vegan menu. The atmosphere is incredible and special props to the resort's design team, too. (Roger Thomas is brilliant - I'm assuming he was involved!) The restaurant is beautifully designed with comfortable chairs and stunning color combinations, along with high ceilings.  The temperature inside the restaurant is perfect! I wore a sleeveless dress and was comfortable throughout our meal -- and I'm often freezing. And the Frank Sinatra music playing throughout the evening was a lovely treat. Just the right volume.  Also - there's a lovely restroom immediately outside the restaurant. (I'm far from lazy but can't stand going to a nice restaurant and having to venture far into the casino to find the ladies room)  Our busser, Jorge, was delightful, too.  On our way to the restaurant I called with a question about parking -- I wanted to self park and wanted to park somewhat close so I didn't have to walk too far in my ridiculously high heels. I was wowed that one of the hotel operators checked with the restaurant to get my number and made a special effort to call me back and advised me on where to park.  That's Wynn/Encore caliber service.",il9YGi12gRza4IcfskDcRw,1,1,5,t_dG700DpWtt7ksnMLcE6Q

Chef Theo has thought up the perfect menu. The truffle risotto is a favorite of mine - they use only the best ingredients. I always start the shrimp cocktail - the shrimp are HUGE and so fresh. For dessert, the chocolate mousse is so rich and comes in the shape of Sinatra's hat. Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had. They have an amazing wine list and the staff is truly well-trained to know what they are talking about.

They offer patio seating with fireplaces, fans, and dim lighting. It is almost like you are sitting in a garden because the landscape around the seating area is so lush and well-kept.

594153,2014-10-27,2,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"You start to wonder whether anything in a Steve Wynn-managed property can be bad. Okay, I'll go out on a limb here - Sinatra may be the best of the bunch. While I can't think of anything I have eaten at Wynn or Encore that is anything worse than ""excellent"", that is a mighty noble feat. 

From the moment you enter through the sit down through the overall service, you cannot help but think that this is the way 'Ole Blue Eyes would have wanted to be treated. Never mind that there isn't really a bad seat in the place. Either you get a first hand view of the spectacular interior or the large portrait of the namesake that adorns the middle of the dining room. Choose to eat outside and get views of lush shrubbery and water. 

My group ordered all over the menu and it was like a tasting party - but one where you can't go wrong. Frank's Spaghetti and Clams.....Osso Bucco ""My Way"" (SO soft and braised by the gods. Even if Osso Bucco is not your thing, ignore. This is in a class by itself)....Branzino.....the prepped-to-virtual-perfection Veal Parmigiana. My own dish was actually the Lasagna ""bolognese"" which is actually served in a little pot which you must do everything to avoid wanting to lick down after you consume the contents. 

Pricewise, you can make it as expensive as you want to be but you can also spend in line with a ""nice"" meal and still be well fed. As as commonplace at Wynn/Encore, there is also a Vegan Menu. 

By the way, highly recommended is an opening cocktail. Well known is the Sinatra Smash (which can have with or without whiskey) but, especially if you like being a toastmaster, give the ""Dream"" a shot - a delightful mix of Grand Brut champagne and St-Germain elderflower liqueur. 

Vegas is now a treasure trove of dining but Sinatra is easily a place worth repeat visiting. By the way, there's a business casual dress code. You want to dress night anyway. Otherwise, Frank would smack you with his fedora... :)",CW7p7lYDoRdfCGJtuapCDQ,1,0,5,tjWzjIuXh5paoCAAkpFOvQ

613080,2011-09-07,6,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"I'm very disappointed. Let me tell you why...

I went to Sinatra early with my friend. We came 15 minutes early. The hostess was out. We talked to her, inquiring when the restaurant would open. It was very clear that we had intentions of dining there. She gave what appeared to be a very fake looking smile. In case, you are wondering, this is the smile where you purse your lips together and pinch your nose at the same time.  I thought it was my imagination-- at first.  

My friend and I both had reservations at Sinatra. We were there on time and looking at the menu. We noticed at the bottom of the really expensively priced menu that there was a note saying that business casual attire was needed.  Well, since the hostess didn't say anything to us we thought that what we were wearing would be ok.

When the restaurant officially opened at 5:30pm, the hostess took down the red rope and let us in. There was a small crowd. There was some guy in a polo shirt with his wife, who happened to be in an evening gown. (I didn't know that qualifies as business casual? Unless his wife is a cocktail waitress...)   

The hostess let that pair in first. When it got to our turn, she told us to please step aside and into the lounge area. This was basically seats next next to the bar, on what were ornamental aka not weight bearing chairs. We sat in these uncomfortable show-pieces. The hostess indicated that she just needed to 'check on something with the computer'. (OK.) The bar guy offered us expensive drinks. (No.)  Then, she proceeded to congregate 4 managers. Yes, four managers at the podium.  They whispered freverently for like 5-10 minutes. The male one nodded his head while staring at us.  Then, they sent over a different female manager over to talk to us.

I know the female manager was just trying to do her job, but seriously tact training is required. She came over to us and said that she was sorry but ""athletic apparel is not allowed in the restaurant.""  But ""if you would like to stay, you can eat in the lounge area? We can serve you the regular food out here.""  (UM. Yeah, right, $100 dollars to be fed pasta on a wobbly table made of glitter & paste. While being treated as second hand citizens-- when polo shirt boy got in?)

I'm sorry but you could have just told us about the attire policy, when we asked about eating there. Instead of congregating 4 managers, making a show of things, and then treating us so condesendingly. 
She then offered 'suggestions for other places we could eat' at the Wynn.  This was like the final blow! 

After that, my friend and I politely declined and left.  It soured our taste for spending money in such an uppity place.  After that, I vowed to come on Yelp and warn other foodies!  Seriously, there are much better places all around. Service is half the price you pay for.",5OPRNWBOE5ME1lY8vkF1MQ,7,2,1,4xyxx4mg2XojkUEJSNUejg

Food is OK, nothing special or exquisite. 

The minus one star goes for the slow and unprofessional service.

ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere is nice, has pictures of Sinatra all over the walls. There is a small garden with pomegranate trees, which were light up at night and it was magical. The tables are big so you can fit in big parties. 

FOOD: For starters we ordered the Caprese salad, which was very small (i.e. three slices of tomato and mozzarella) and the Panzanella con Ganchio. For dinner we ordered Branzino and Tagliata. Note that when you ask for your meat to be prepared medium well, they bring it as if you asked for a well done. The meat is a bit dry and loses its taste.

DESERT: The deserts are good; they put ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate, which was touching and cute.

DRINKS: We ordered red wine (nothing special), after that I ordered the Sinatra Smash.

What changed was the service. On my last visit it was reasonably attentive, despite the fact that I was dining in a large group. When I returned, everything seemed fine until we placed our order. The waiter brought my wine, and then disappeared. We literally did not see, speak to or hear from him again for the rest of our visit.

That meant that when my glass needed refilling, busboys had to be flagged down. When our dishes came and no parmesan cheese was offered, busboys had to be flagged down again. No one came by to ask us how our dishes were and if we needed anything else. When we wanted dessert and the check? A manager came and apologized to us, gave us our check (no comps offered, if you're wondering), then went on her merry way.

Right from the hostess stand we were greeted with a smile. Our servers were prompt and very professional and we never had to ask for a thing. Our head waiter Suzanne was phenomenal! She was so warm and friendly and made some amazing suggestions. We had the veal parm and it literally melts in your mouth. The side dish special for that night was fresh pasta with parm and table side shaved truffles. It was heavenly. Very rich though so I'm glad we did it as a side and not an entree. We finished with dessert, (a chocolate shaped fedora), a cappuccino and a little Sinatra Jack Daniels which Suzanne also recommended. The veal parm was truly the best I've ever had. The pork chop was a little dry, but as the veal was the size of a plate, there was plenty to share, but you won't want to. The decor is very cool so take the time to look at some of the pics on the wall. All of the staff had helpful suggestions as to where to pose for the best pictures.

I'm not used to having so many choices, especially in a fine dining restaurant! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sinatra to any vegans who find themselves in Las Vegas! A perfect place for a special occasion meal... and honestly, it wasn't even as expensive as we were prepared for it to be!

My husband isn't even vegan, but he found the vegan menu so compelling that he ordered the vegan chicken parmesan, and it was ridiculously good. I had the vegan Caesar salad and chicken marsala (which came with vegan gnocchi!) and they were both outstanding. Sadly, we got too stuffed to eat dessert!

In addition to the food, the service was perfect! They really paid attention to little details. When we arrived, they gave us a handwritten Thank You card for coming to spend our special day with them. At the end of the meal, they brought us some sorbet on a plate that had Happy Anniversary written on it in chocolate. Also, the busser originally told me they were out of vegan butter, which was no big deal for me..... we asked for olive oil instead, and it was the best olive oil I have ever eaten. Then, like 10 minutes later, he showed up with vegan butter, explaining they went and got some from a different restaurant for me! Talk about going the extra mile!

First of all, my bias must be clear: I am a huge fan of Frank Sinatra. When I saw Encore had a place dedicated to the Chairman of the Board, I immediately thought, ""I must eat there!""

The atmosphere didn't disappoint in the slightest. The first thing you see upon walking in is Frank's actual Oscar, Emmy, and Grammy awards (very cool!) as well as some of Steve Wynn's personal memorabilia harkening to the memories he shared with Frank. They have jazz standards on the sound system and old Sinatra movies on a TV over the bar. While I was there, Guys and Dolls was playing and then it switched over to From Here to Eternity. The restaurant is further complimented with giant, wall-sized pictures of Sinatra. So far, the place was definitely living up to my expectations.

What I didn't expect, however, was how good the food would be...

Appetizer: Carpaccio tuna. Light, delicious, almost melted in your mouth. Even if you're not a big fan of sushi, you will enjoy this dish. 

Main Course: Chicken Saltimbocca. This was a whole breast of chicken on the bone, with prosciutto baked around it, served on a bed of spinach.  The chicken was juicy and the prosciutto was fantastic. As a side dish I had the gnocchi, which was actually kind of a let down. It was too overdone and as a result was way too soft and mushy. 

Dessert: Tiramisu. Probably one of the best exampled of tiramisu I have ever had. Light, airy, and yet filling. 

All in all, I had a great time at Sinatra. By the way, the cocktails are superb, so even if you just stop by for a drink you will enjoy yourself. I recommend the Negroni.",FdhfBeQ9xICQoWivL6czSQ,1,1,5,WtVHCslYZiCqDsh04i3rFw

I risked getting the spaghetti and clams and I regret it.
For $35 I got an overlooked Italian nightmare. The idea of adding red sauce to the dish wasn't really smart, it overpowered the clams making you taste only garlic. The pasta was so over cooked that I basically ate none of it.
The eggplant parmigiana was cold and messy.

To boot, I ordered a side of spaghetti, cooked perfectly al Dente and then as you taste it, the same bitter almost inedible tomato sauce.  For just about $60 for a veal chop (which I'm thrilled to lay but it does come with expectations of quality and taste) it should've been 1000x better than this. I started with the Caesar salad which has a lemon zest kick and the crunchy lettuce was good and fresh too but again has a bitterness to it.  I never felt like I left a restaurant and needed something sweet to get the bitter horrible taste out of my mouth. What a bummer, I was excited for this restaurant and it's a major disappointment.

The Bruschetta is not on the menu. The server, after hearing my husband ask me if it was on the menu (he didn't know what it was called), stated that he would ask the chef to prepare it. It was a delicious treat. 

I cannot remember exactly what it was called but I got the salad with lump crab meat and avocado. It was outstanding. I want to go back just to have it again. Additionally I tried the beet salad. It was perfectly dressed and fantastic. 

I ordered the New York Strip Medium and, while the steak was good, it was a little too charred for my taste. I ordered the polenta fries for my side. Sprinkled with parmesan, they were very tasty.

Planned a dinner evening with my wife and two friends. I explained over the phone we have two vegetarians in the group and we were celebrating an occasion. They actually made it a point to ask me too which I thought was really great.

When we got there on time, we waited a a few minutes and then got seated in reasonable time. That's where it started to go down hill.

First problem: Inattentive staff. They took way too much time actually getting our orders in. Plenty of people standing around literally 3 feet from us. And we are looking right at them. Likely unnecessary managers - who do very little. Fire them, and hire more waitstaff. No one was helping us out. Our waiter was busy running around to other tables. We patiently waited and even asked the server who put the bread down and he sternly replies the waiter would be right with us. I should have got up and left right there. I can't stand restaurants where others don't help you out. It shows lack of leadership and teamwork.

Second problem: We explained multiple times we had vegetarians, but no one offered us a vegetarian or vegan menu. We figured there were literally only a few dishes for us as a result. Both the vegetarians ordered appetizers, and walked out hungry. Turns out there was a vegan menu. The couple next to us received it right when they sat down.

Third problem: The food is just not worth it ($65 appetizer which was average at best and can be found at the Noodle Company) and the atmosphere is frankly, worse than the Cheesecake Factory. Absolutely nothing unique or exclusive about it aside from Sinatra's awards on the wall.

Two stars because once food was actually ordered it was brought out quickly. And the complimentary"" bread and Sinatra Smash were probably the most unique and worthwhile parts of the entire evening. Just not sure they were worth the $300+ final bill. (Yes, we left the customary tip. Although we probably shouldn't have.)

1300900,2016-07-21,2,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"A rather good experience turned unpleasant. We dined at Sinatra mid-July, as it was steps from our suite.  Reservation was made for 7pm, yet despite arriving two minutes early, we were made to wait ten minutes. Another party, arriving after us, was seated first. The mocktail I had in the meantime - Sinatra splash(?) was way too sweet and not good at all.  Eventually, though, we did receive one of the three best tables in the house, so this wait could be forgiven.   

Our server was cold and pushed the sale of alcohol.  We are avid wine drinkers, but since I'm pregnant, we decided to skip libations that evening.  He still asked my husband three times if he wanted something from the bar and even went on to slowly explain that they offer wine by the glass. Despite hearing three times 'no', he insisted on leaving wine menu on our table ""just in case.""  That level of sales push is unacceptable in a fine dining establishment. 

Onto the food. We shared a vegetable salad, which was tasty. I had the lamb, and while perfectly proper, I didn't find it overly exciting. I felt the presentation was uninspired.  The plate was way too big and it seemed that the chef was trying to cater to the median palate and stomach size. The lamb was also quite fatty, but given the size, I could cut off the fatty parts and still was left very satisfied. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana, which was enormous, but he really enjoyed it.  Desserts were the highlight. Tiramisu, though not classic, was light and fluffy and very good. The panna cotta was easily among the best we've ever tried and my husband is a big panna cotta aficionado.  Sadly, cappuccinos were bad. Too much too hot water in the shot, too much milk and not enough foam - the foam not creamy. 

Onto the bad. At 3am I woke up with horrible nausea.  I spent three hours battling the symptoms of food poisoning. In the morning, my husband told me that he woke up earlier, closer to midnight, with a very bad heartburn and some nausea.  The next day was tainted by my stomach playing up. Yes, I am pregnant, but seven months of my pregnancy had passed with no gastric episodes whatsoever before I dined at Sinatra. I blame the veg salad that we shared. We also shared both desserts, but it's the thought of this salad that gives me the chills. 

So, my rating is as follows - the food 4.5, half less star for the service and additional star for the medical aftershocks.",gyDj6McjLsKB0V0QkikR3w,6,0,3,nxpyP-8qc5MfsVzwXmiD7w

Perhaps it was what I ordered (branzino). Or perhaps it was the cold service. It just wasn't the dining experience you would expect from a restaurant with such high accolades.

We started off with their standard breadbasket which was good. The rest of the food just didn't meet our expectations. My friend ordered a dish that was overdone on the spice. There was so much heat in it that it ruined his palette. My other friend had a lobster risotto that looked delicious. However, the risotto was surprisingly bland and she didn't finish it.  My branzino lacked substance and was overdressed with EVOO.

The service itself was... Meh.  While we were tended by three different people, our cocktail / wine selections were slow to be ordered / reordered and our water was slow to be filled. Our primary server seemed overwhelmed and in attentive.  I was personally in a rush to get to an event and had to ask for the bill repeatedly before it finally came. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were just extremely busy.  Nonetheless this was my experience.  I want to give Sinatra another chance but with so many fine dining options in Vegas... I just don't know if I'll ever get back around to it.  Good luck with your own experience.",qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q,3,0,3,Z_ZbSaIQYSx9FA3REGBeAg

Classic interior, great for a nice date or just to enjoy a meal with friends.

For starters, my group of 4 shared the Frank's Clams Posilipo: reminded me of a cioppino.  light and not overly salty.

I ordered the Milanese, and this thing was HUGE!  My portion of veal was literally bigger than my head, so I feel less bad about shelling out the 45 bucks for this dish.  The breading was very light and just right.  Not oily or greasy at all.  

For dessert, we shared the tiramusu which was perfect to share among the 4 of us.  We also shared the capuccino over gelato (I don't recall what it was called on the menu) and this was delicious!!!  You've got to get it.

By no means was our meal ""cheap.""  It was $101 each, but considering we also got two bottles of red and three of us got post-dinner coffee, the cost of the meal wasn't all that expensive.

We had the tiramisu for desert.  I am a big tiramisu fan and order it at least once a week. It was served in an oversized martini glass. Once again the portion was generous and taste was exactly what I hoped.

My father had the lasagna and all but inhaled it whereas we all split some appetizers. I fully recommend loosening the hold on your wallet so that you can loosen your belt when your stomach is thanking you!

Was it expensive? HELL YES
Was it worth every penny? HELL YES
Will I go back? Certainly, after I gather a few more paychecks.

I had the Polpettine appetizer (meatballs with polenta fries).  It was 4 tiny meatballs that were ok.  Save your money and don't order this one!

Ordered the Ossobuco ""My Way"" which is the house specialty.  It is a braised veal served with risotto.  This was AMAZING!!!

Ordered something for dessert.  Don't remember what it was.  It was pretty good, from what I remember.

But the Ossobuco totally stole the show and overshadowed everything else about the meal.

The bill for 6 of us was well over $600, so it ain't cheap.

Service was exceptional.

Reservations are recommended.  There is a dress code.

I enjoyed this restaurant so much on a previous trip that this time, I brought my wife here to celebrate our anniversary. She enjoyed it immensely as well and can't wait to return. 

With a nod to Old Blue Eyes, the sweet songs of Sinatra greet you as soon as you enter the welcoming hostess at the entrance. While there, linger a moment and appreciate Frank's awards and trophies - and some choice photos - adorning the wall.

The dining room is as exquisite as they come. The chairs so comfortable that if you lean back, you just might fall asleep. The soft music of Frank's many hits continues to play in the background as you settle into your seat and, by candlelight, examine a menu fit for kings and queens. 

I opted for Frank's Spaghetti and Clams, which was one of Sinatra's favorites. I can see why. It was outstanding. I added some parmesean asparagus on the side and lemme tell you....if you don't like asparagus, you'll love this. It almost tasted like some kind of pizza! 

We capped it off with an amazing dessert. I wish I could remember exactly what it was called but it really doesn't matter because they all looked good. It was so nice how they fancied the tasty dessert up with a warm ""Happy Anniversary"" message on the plate (see photo). 

I should mention that everyone we encountered at the restaurant seemed to know we were celebrating and wished us a happy anniversary at every turn. There was even a nice card on the table when we arrived. How nice is that?

I opted to keep it as I get a little chilly, and it was tailor made for me and I rarely let it out of my sight. We were also welcomed with a card wishing us a happy anniversary. Beautifully handwritten and personalized.  I knew right then, this was going to be great.

We visited the bar first, as we were a few minutes early.  The bar tender was very busy, yet  very nice and the Pinot Gregio was probably the best I've ever tasted. So smooth and just a brilliant wine.  Hubby had a Bloody Mary and said it was nice.

When we were seated for dinner, our table had a lovely view of the garden patio and fireplace.  Had it been a bit warmer, we may have enjoyed appetizers or dessert out there, but it was in the 40s.  The dining room had such a genuinely warm feel, it was almost as if 'Old Blue Eyes' were in the room.  I believe he was, at least in spirit.

The service at Sinatra is WORLD CLASS. Actually, I will say it is absolutely the best service we've ever had anywhere, ever.  We have been all over the world, dined at Michelin restaurants across the globe. Without question, Sinatra is better than any restaurant we have experienced.

While I cannot remember our server's name, he was impeccable!  We never wanted for anything.  Our glasses were always filled, and he was so knowledgeable about each dish and was great in giving his ideas on each dish. 

We started with a lovely Caesar salad that was just perfect. Not too much, not too little and perfectly plated.  To our great surprise, the chef sent out a most delightful butternut squash bisque with his compliments for our anniversary.  I LOVE butternut squash. and this bisque was just amazing.  Perfection!

Next, our main course arrived. Hubby had 'Filetto' 10 oz beef tenderloin and I had 'Agnolotti' small pasta pockets filled with butternut squash and parmesan. My dish was sheer perfection and brilliantly presented. It was so wonderful and perfectly portioned, cooked to perfection and the taste was too incredible to put into words.  Then, there was my hubby's filet. Oh, my!  There are truly no words to describe this one either. It was by far, the very best tenderloin either of us have ever tasted!  It practically melted in our mouths. SO delicious! There are no words. Cooked to perfection and beautifully plated. Again, just the perfect amount to enjoy.  I could not eat all of my dinner, but hubby would have licked the plate clean if we were at home.  It was just that awesome.  We also shared a side Purea di Patate, mashed potatoes, which were excellent.

We lingered a bit longer enjoying and savoring our memory of an awesome dinner when the staff came and presented us with a personalized dessert for our anniversary!  It featured the famous 'Frank's Hat' and a lovely layer chocolate mousse.  What can I say? That was exceptional!  Tremendously delicious and the perfect ending to a world-class amazing meal.

We waited a while and hoped the check would come, but it never did.  Our server asked if we cared for anything more, and hubby asked for our check.  He walked away and returned and said that this meal was compliments of our adult children!  OMG! I started crying. I could not believe it.  The staff knew all along and kept it secret.

It was the meal of a lifetime, one we will always remember.",GWf0oDFCwx-bNS6LhL75gA,5,1,5,d5_dStODHGAIFrCEyb8bnA

My dad had the lasagna and he might as well have stayed home and heated up the Lean Cuisine brand in the microwave.

Starters
Prosciutto with melon: Perfect starter. 
Beets, citrus segments, fried goat cheese, pistachios - beets were super fresh and an excellent spring starter.
Tuna carpaccio was fresh and flavorful, well-paired with pickled vegetables, pine nuts, raisins, in a balsamic reduction.

Mains
Branzino - phenomenal. Potentially best branzino I've ever had. Came highly recommended from our server, justified.
Cioppino - hearty seafood stew of lobster, clams, scallops, shrimp, couscous in tomato lobster broth. Friend enjoyed this dish.

Service was good after initial hiccups. We requested to be reseated from a long table to a round table to allow for better conversation, which was accommodated but took awhile to reseat us.

Top notch and well worth the meandering through Encore to find it (we were coming from Palazzo, so it was a bit of a walk). I had made a reservation on Open Table and would seriously suggest doing so as the dining room definitely filled up. We were seated in the back room with only a few tables and had the amazing Suzanne as our waitress (she just doesn't work Sundays and Mondays so ask for her if you go any other day and she'll treat you right!). I would definitely go back here and request outdoor seating when the weather is right! We all enjoyed our food immensely - I'll focus on what I ordered and what I tried.

I started with a half order of the Agnolotti. It's not listed as a half order, but it's one of the options they can do that way (a little tip from Suzanne). The small pasta pockets were filled with butternut squash and in a lovely light olive oil sauce with great flavors infused. Each bit melted in my mouth with rich flavors, but didn't ever taste too heavy. My dining mates each ordered the Prosciutto (seriously enough to share - looked like 1 pound of Prosciutto!) and the Carpaccio di Bue (phenomenal!). The carpaccio beef was thinly sliced with a great salsa verde, arugula and Parmesan. It was melt in your mouth goodness. They bring a nice bread basket to the table and were accommodating with a special gluten free basket as we had one gluten free diner. The butter served with the bread was out of this world. For my main course, I followed Suzanne's recommendation and went for the veal Parmesan. I typically don't order a lot of veal as I think it can be done wrong and she said that it's her favorite thing on the menu after working there 8 years and she never orders veal anywhere else because this is so tender, you could cut it with a spoon. Truth, my friends - it was seriously tender. They thinly pounded it until it was the size of my plate or the size of my face and it was covered with Pomodoro sauce and melted mozzarella. I couldn't finish it all, but could barely stop eating because it was just THAT good. Needless to say, I did not save room for dessert. We had a nice bottle of wine with dinner that was kept chilled just to the side of the table.

Lovely decor with pictures of Sinatra throughout and his music is playing in the dining room. As a side note, take time to go to the restrooms, as they were a sight in and of themselves. Seriously a fantastic experience!. And, to prove how personable they were, on the way out, the hostess that I had interacted with only once at the start of the meal thanked me by name and said she hoped I would return.

We chose Sinatra to celebrate TWO special occasions--our wedding annviersary, and my husband's birthday (they are a couple of days apart). With the infinite choices out there in Las Vegas, we chose Sinatra. Big mistake.

Our bill was over $340, and yet, they charged us for BOTH my husband's birthday dessert AND our anniversary dessert!!!

30 years of fine dining, and we've never experienced such a thing. We are the type of Wynn guests that get a rep assigned to us during our many stays--and this is how you treat us?

Obviously, with the amount of travel and fine dining that we do, and the fact that our bill was already over $340, this is NOT about money! 

It's about the tackiness and low brow move, of a restaurant that bills itself as fine dining at a 5 star resort.

The server repeatedly acknowledged our anniversary, and my husband's birthday. The two desserts even had ""Happy Anniversary"" and ""Happy Birthday"" written on their respective plates--so it's not like they didn't know. We were shocked, paid the bill, along with a generous tip, and left completely aghast.

If the restaurant has a particular dessert designated for people celebrating a special occasion that they do not charge for, then the server should have TOLD US so we could make an informed decision. Also, if this were the case, then he would have presumably brought us that dessert too. Our server said ""Happy Anniversary"" and ""Happy Birthday"" and then PROCEEDED TO ASK US WHAT WE WANTED FOR DESSERT. So he completely bamboozled us into ordering TWO desserts that we otherwise would not even have ordered.

We arrive and ditsy hostess says they don't have one.
I was with a high roller regular so he pressed and the manager was dancing around us, afraid to speak the truth, so he said the outside was set up for a private birthday party.

Pressed harder, they finally gave us a table for four.
The outside is lovely but inside is fantastic as well.

Our server Suzanne was spectacular.
We had a ravioli truffle appetizer that was $115 and was decadent.

Suzanne is a professional server and took exceptional care of us.

We started with a cocktail, I had a light and sweet Bellini, Jacob his normal Knob Creek on the rocks. We began dinner with a caprese salad, the variety of tomatoes were sweet and flavorful especially for February.  The buffalo mozzarella was creamy and incredibly fresh, it was a perfect beginning. 

For our entrees I had the lobster chanterelle mushroom risotto, so earthy, delicate, and creamy. The lobster was rich and succulent. Jacob had the classic Italian Lasagna Bolognese, with hand made pasta sheets and a veal, pork and beef Bolognese sauce. Everything tasted incredible and the quality was phenomenal.

Good:

Caesar, $19

Beef Carpaccio, $24
BLAND and super boring.

BAD:
John Dory, $55
Super salty and way too creamy.  Could barely taste the fish.
Bomboloni, $12
This was not fresh and NOT tasty at all.  Had one, b/c I felt bad.
Double Espresso $5.50

The room is underrated, so warm. We were seated along the far wall in a booth, but although it was January, there is outdoor seating and with the heat lamps there were brave folks outside.

I was imagining fruit, bread, crackers, olives, maybe a little prosciutto or salame. Grape tomatoes... anything! Man, I wish I took a picture of this $30 cheese plate! My husband and I literally laughed out loud when it arrived at the table. It had four measly, bite-size jokes of cheese - two of which were inedible. I have no idea what they were because neither the menu nor our waiter provided any descriptions, but they didn't taste or look like cheese. And those seasonal accompaniments? Five almonds. Yep, five almonds. I was offended that the waiter didn't tell me how ridiculous this starter was when we ordered it. Beyond that, the complimentary bread was ice cold and stale. The food over-priced and ranging from unimpressive to downright awful. Im frustrated with myself for not sending everything back like a normal person probably would have.

Unlike the Encore Hotel in which the restaurant resides, the decor is reminiscent of 1950s ""Hollywood"" class that reminds you of an upscale bar/lounge with plush seating.  The foyer houses two pedestal cases bearing homage to Old Blue Eyes, prominently displaying his Emmy and Oscar trophies.

The menu was fairly simple with some classic Italian favorites.  My colleague and I wanted to try everything but opted for some house recommendations: the Cappesante (seared maine diver scallop, with a light celery and kumquat salad); freshmade rigatoni and agnolotti; and tiramisu the Sinatra way.

The flavor contrast between courses, as recommended by our server, was much appreciated.  The Cappesante delivered a delicious, clean punch.  And our server, without even having been asked, split the flavorful rigatoni and agnolotti for us (so thoughtful and much more elegant than if we were to dig in each other's plates from across the table!).  The tiramisu is something not to be missed.

4. We didn't ask for a new waiter but got a second person who automatically engaged us and this person was very nice. I wish he had mentioned that the food was going to be really bad. We were soon to find out.

5. Our food came out and waiter disappeared. A third waiter engaged us and I had 75% of my meal on my plate. It was sad that I had paid $52 for a cup of noodles and chicken parmesan, and it tasted like crap, but the servers could care less. This is the part that hurts. This is not a Macaroni Grill or Mall Food Court, but in my much younger days, I've had frozen dinner spaghetti that tasted the same. Sad news.

In summary, I truly hated my food at this place. I mentioned this fact to the waiter that closed us out, especially seeing that he clearly noted that 3/4 of my plate was untouched, however, he reacted in a way that showed he could care less and only cared that we closed the check, most likely with undeserved gratuity, and left. I felt that was unfair. I did leave a 15% gratuity that I felt the second waiter (and welcome staff) deserved and didn't want to have them suffer as they weren't responsible for the whole experience.

This is meant to a high-end restaurant with very professional attitudes, and an experience like mine should have been forwarded to the attention of a manager... immediately. Decor is alright (nothing spectacular) but food is poor.

Truly disappointed. Sinatra is rolling over in his grave. This restaurant is a glorified Maggiano's Restaurant.... except for last I visited Maggiano's, years back, I recall it having much better tasting food.

Let's see if the restaurant chooses to reach out and address this issue with me, or other guests. I'll be waiting.",6s149mWoASzs5MR_rw7x5A,1,0,1,1BoIyj2HNDMMq8VhJnyFgw

We had the caprese and a fettuccine alfredo with black truffles as apps. The capresse was ok, but the alfredo was a huge disappointment. The black truffles had no aroma... they clearly used an oil in the alfredo to get any flavor.  I tasted it prior to the shavings of truffle and after fresh truffle was added. No difference. Look at the picture. They covered it in shavings! Yet flavorless $105 for the appetizer that was a complete bust. 

For dinner we got the osso buco and veal parmesan. Both were nice cuts of meat, decent sauces but overall I would say just ""ok""  

Clearly we had only a few items from the menu so maybe we were just unlucky. 

The manager cane over and apologized and offered to buy us dessert. Nice jester. Hind sight I should have told them eairlier and maybe got something different",zQ8mxt9pHiy7YnVNffRjmw,3,0,3,ssNzB9JDc69XehoNOvtl1w

It is a large restaurant with outdoor seating - I could see a fireplace out there that looked very inviting. Resos recommended.
The dishes to me are perhaps pricier than they need to be for what you get... BUT.. if you order the clams and spaghetti like I did ($33), you will get a ton of clams heaped on and pasta that is not overcooked, phew! Too many places overcook their pasta and you feel ripped off, not here. Some may say the seasoning is a bit too much but for me it was fine. Especially as there is no salt and pepper on the table. The clams had been properly cleaned and were not gritty.
I had to ask for black pepper for my pasta and it should have been offered for my appetizer salad but, small detail. 
The Riesling white wine was very good but for $16 a glass it better be!
My friends each had the lasagna (also around $33) and enjoyed it. I found portions to be adequate.
I do recommend the Caesar salad to start although I found it to be missing that bit of bacon to make it extra yummy. Perfectly cool and crisp lettuce, dressed perfectly, not overloaded with croutons.
We also shared a Caprese salad and while this was a less hearty option, staff split it on 2 plates without us even asking and the mozza was very fresh. 
We skipped dessert as we were just too full but we left feeling like we had a nice meal and would recommend if staying at or near Wynn/Encore.",is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,3,1,4,KSVLhLjhiBpJLuyg4bwBhQ

The decor is nice in sea greens and corals. As with the rest of the resort the fixtures are unique and the finishes are level four. (yes I am in the design industry) There is Frank's Oscar, a Grammy and an Emmy at the entry which is pretty special if you are a fan. (I am) They were playing From Here to Eternity at the bar and sound wise mostly Sinatra, with some Peggy Lee, Dino, Sammy, and Nat King Cole. 

There was a Happy Anniversary card for us at the table as well as we were comped our first round of drinks for the occasion. This was super sweet. Nice touch!

We started with the Caresse Salad which was fresh and perfectly balanced. I ordered the hand rolled spaghetti, while J-bo ordered the lasagna. Both were delicious. 

The solemner was gracious and very informative. This is a high scale restaurant and they offer pretty expensive wines.  Being from San Francisco, we know of many wines as high quality at a lower price point, but when in Vegas...  The wine she suggested was perfect with the meal and our tastes.

we kept it simple and started with the meatballs (3) they forgot to mention MINI meatballs they were the size of a quarter. THEY HAD ZERO TASTE WHAT SO EVER...
i had the chicken parm for my entree it came out in a medal pan actually did not look that bad.. then i cut into it the chicken was very very thick and the cheese and sauce had no taste. after eating it i realized these dishes are 100% pre made. the side of spaghetti that was not included with the entree was so tiny and so mushy it could have passed as mashed potatoes. 
all 8 of us hated our food including the pasta with shrimp and lobster sauce and the lasagna.

We both had a delicious filet. It was perfectly cooked, and surrounded by the most wonderful au jus and vegetables. There was a surprise with some great tasting very thick pieces of bacon in the sauce, and the best tasting little onions and tomatoes you've ever had on top. We met the chef, who has a German name, but who is Italian by birth from Northern Italy. He is a gem. Everything we had that night was simply delicious.

We attended on a Saturday night without a reservation. We only had to wait about 30 minutes so we gambled a little while waiting. The hostess was so friendly and called a little earlier than we expected to be seated. 

Once inside we were greeted by our server Pedro who was very friendly. When we asked for suggestions on meals he went into great detail about the most popular items and made everything sound so good. We decided to order Penette and the Lasagna. Both were very delicious and creamy. 

Before our food was served we were given bread with yummy spreads and we ordered a few rounds of drinks. We started with the Sinatra Smash. I'm not a huge lover of whiskey but this drink was actually one of my favorites. While sipping on our drinks we decided to order a few appetizers, the Mussels and another one that had meatballs and cheese bread(I forgot the name of it). Both were pretty good but I liked the mussels better. They were served with a tomato sauce over it that was really good. Once we were finished with our appetizers dinner was served. The portion sizes aren't big so I'm glad that we did order an appetizer to help fill us up :) Halfway through our dinner Pedro served us with a complimentary serving of the chefs soup of the night. I'm not sure if they do that every night but it was a kind gesture and the soup was really creamy and light, it was a tomato basil soup.

2841492,2009-12-07,0,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"Fourth night of honeymoon, fourth great dinner.  After watching La Reve, we made our way over to Sinatra at the Encore.  The first thing that you notice while approaching is the Black and Gold Sinatra sign above the walk in entrance.   It really helps to set the mood of the evening, and like his music, the joint is classy.  We were seated within 5 minutes, even though the restaurant was full and we were 20 minutes early. 

The chairs were wide comfy wooden loungers, and the decor reminded me of a Godfather movie set adorned with large oils of Sinatra, his music playing in the back ground, with reddish orange hues and elaborate rope chandeliers reminiscent of  a high end restaurant from the 50's.  Perfect for the Chairmen of the Board.  A spot where wise guys would come and at the end of the meal say ""Put it on my tab,"" the owner rightfully knowing that if he asked them to pay, he might be sleeping with the fishes in Lake Las Vegas.  

Dressed for the affair, I was wearing a suit, and my bride looked so good in her black dress and new Manolos, if she had been on the menu, I would have ordered her.  I know, I know, I just got married, give me a break.  

We started with a bottle of bubbly, I don't recall the name, but at about $95 it was reasonably priced, and lasted us through the meal.  We began with two aps, a crab salad and an octopus in marinara sauce.   The dish was simple and straight forward with lots of white crab meat tossed in a mayonnaise based dressing.  The octopus dish was very interesting and something that I would never have conceived in my kitchen at home.   However when I think of it now, a nice tomato gravy with slowly simmered tender pieces of octopus and capers, not only sounds but tastes really good.

Of course the service was exemplary.  We had one of the older waiters who said that he had been with the restaurant since it opened 2 years ago.  He recommended that I have the Ossobucco, paired with a glass of cabernet...sounded good to me, and my wife decided on the chicken wrapped in prosciutto served with spinach.  Both dishes were high quality.  My plate looked like something out of a French cook book circa 1945, and had flavors of red wine, pot roast, and sherry which paired nicely with the recommended wine.  My wife's chicken was perfectly cooked, and the prosciute helped to impart a smoky flavor while keeping the bird tender and moist.  
For dessert,  we ordered the Tiramisu which was also good, but felt a little pre made, meaning that it came served in a martini glass, and seemed a little wet for our tastes, like it had been made yesterday, or even 2 days prior.  Still not bad, and a great way to finish the meal which after the  still water, and the bubbly, 2 aps, 2 main courses, a glass of wine, and a beer, came out to an obese price tag of $380 tip included.   

A great restaurant, but truthfully I felt a little overlooked.  When I made my reservations here, I had said that it was my honeymoon.  That should at least warrant a small congratulations dessert, or perhaps a shot of limoncello, or something to celebrate with.  Botero, two nights prior went above and beyond the call to make us feel welcomed, and I still remember our sommelier and our waiter's name.  This was not the case at Sinatra.   

That being said, you should defiantly eat here, just don't expect the staff or the waiter to do anything extra for your special occasion.  With a restaurant based on a guy like Sinatra, I expected just a little more generosity.  However, I would like to congratulate Mr. Wynn for really capturing the true essence of the man, and for making a restaurant that I know Frankie would have been proud to put his name on.",_bUf-9uN9ajvLs03VBxn6Q,3,0,4,SvDHPGLN8zC8rPWeU0k_rA

Wife's vegan and she and I wanted a date night during our Vegas trip, so decided to sample how the other side (i.e. those who have money) lives for once.  We had heard that Sinatra was really good to vegans so we snagged a reservation and checked them out.  

First thing we noticed was when I told the server my wife was vegan, upon bringing out the bread they separated the bread that had cheese on it from everything else and also gave her Earth Balance to use instead of regular butter.  That's pretty cool.  And their drink menu is gigantic.  Lots of awesome options for those who favor the harder stuff over beer/wine, those of course being me.

After we had pounded a couple cocktails we both got the chicken parmigiana (with hers being the ""chicken"", aka Gardein version).  Now, being that I don't eat at fancy restaurants like these all that often, I was curious what their entree portion size was like.  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical that we might end up in something out of American Psycho and get a $100 plate of elaborately-decorated thimble-sized food.  But such was not the case!  They bring my plate out and it's two huge cuts with the chicken absolutely dominated with cheese.    Same for the wife for her Gardein version with vegan cheese.  I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DOWN, FRANK! 

It was delicious as all hell and though we really wanted to try the vegan chocolate bar dessert, we were entirely too full.  It is still a pricey affair - two drinks, two entrees and a side ran us $140 after tip - but it's a lovely atmosphere, we got plenty of food and the staff was extremely friendly and treated my wife like vegan royalty.

The vegan food was amazing, but I had a few issues with the place this time. 

This was my second visit here and it didn't compare to the first, except in price. 

When you spend $300 dollars on dinner you'd expect to have the freedom to wear a hat (it's winter by the way, so being asked to take your hat off wasn't cool in my view, specially for such high prices... You should be allowed to wear antlers and a tail if you wanted to!) and that in the least you'd get clean silverware (Got a dirty knife and had to send it back). 

The service was kind of slow as well, but they were pretty busy. 

But the vegan chicken was soooo good I'm almost not bummed about the rest. 

Come prepared to pay big bucks for a glass of wine too. 

Hopefully, the bad was a one time thing. But then again, how often do you want to spend that kind of money on dinner anyway?

The dining room is beautiful and if it had been a bit warmer, I would have loved to dine out on the patio.  It certainly looked romantic there with the twinkling lights and the fireplace. But, the main dining room is a lovely room and is lit perfectly and the decor is classy.

Our server Dina was warm, hospital, friendly and helpful. She made recommendations, but since I'd already looked over the menu online, I knew what I was having.

We started with a great Antipasto plate and a good Caesar Salad.  The Buffalo Mozzarella was fresh and delicious, as were the peppers and the meat selection.  The Caesar was good, but not awesome.  Though, I did enjoy the anchovy.

For a main course I had the Spaghetti and Clams and my wife had the Branzino.  The spaghetti was tasty and though the clams were tiny they were sweet and tender and there were lots of them.  It was the Branzino that was our favorite though.  It had a light delicate flavor and was prepared just right.

We had not planned on dessert, but since I casually mentioned there was some grit in the clams (a big no-no, but not really a big deal to me, since I liked the authenticity of them and to me the sand showed they were fresh.  As a kid we used to dig clams and a bit of grit was just part of the experience), they comped us the dessert and we had the chocolate Frank's Fedora.  It was very good, but we were full, so it was a bit much.

We are big fans of the Wynn/Encore and have eaten at the Country Club, Lakeside, SW, Botero before it became Jardin along with Allegro and Zooza Crackers and the Buffet. I think our favorite overall is Lakeside, but the new Jardin has sort of bewitched us as a upscale casual dining experience.

Ordered the pappardelle and spaghetti with clams. No complaints  about the taste. Way overpriced though. Apparently the pappardelle was fresh made, but for  nearly 30-40$/ pasta entree, ALL the pasta should be made in house (not dry and from a box) and taste like it. This didn't , so that was disappointing. We passed on dessert, and yet with one drink, salad, and a teeny bowl of veggies (not good), the total bill with T/T was  still more than150$.

Pardon the pseudo-joke, but truly, if you like Italian food, this is your kind of place. If you like Frankie's music, this is your kind of place. And if you like BOTH Italian food AND Sinatra's music, this is a not-to-be-missed stop while in Vegas. 

Our party of three loves both. So we were fascinated with the Sinatra and authentic Rat Pack items on display at the restaurant entrance (intimate correspondance between Frank and Sammy, Frank and Wynn, and others, along with some of his many awards). We were seated promptly and given a window table overlooking the terrasse and outdoor fireplaces. It was a beautiful table, and the whole restaurant is elegant and understated - except for the humongous portrait of The Chairman dominating the main wall! 

Our waiter was superb, catering to my very-particular parents. My father wanted a basic pasta dish not on the menu; he was told sure! No problem, the chef can whip that up. Al dente, perfectly cooked, just as my dad liked it (he is hard to please). The waiter overheard my mother and I saying how we weren't sure we could finish a whole dish and he said he could gladly order us half portions of anything we liked. Wow, that was fantastic! It totally fit the bill! I ordered Sinatra's pasta with clams, and it was light and flavorful and the perfect portion. I forget what my mother had, but she loved it.

I opted for just some coffee after the meal, but my folks had the creme brullee and the various scoops of gelato, the latter which was plated beautifully. They also put a few chocolates on the table, which was a lovely touch. We talked well into the next day about how lovely our dinner was here.

I have done reports on him and the rat pack in school and even had my father daughter dance at my wedding to ""fly me to the moon""

So me going to this restaurant is an absolute must, Anytime I can possibly get there. 

What I love is the story behind the restaurant and the amazing friendship that Steve Wynn (owner of the casino where Sinatra is located) and Frank Sinatra have had over the years. That's something you can feel as soon as you walk into the restaurant. 

On display you'll find some of Frank's most amazing awards such as a Grammy, and Oscar and an Emmy.  Those are things that to me just make you feel like your dining in Franks home. 

Now for the food! 
Couldn't ask for anything better OMG. 
I had the chicken parm and it's always cooked to perfection with the perfect ratio of melted cheese and tomato sauce. 

My mom has the short rib pasta and it was so so tasty. 

Our appetizer was the polenta fries and meatballs and it reminds me SO much of the kind my granny used to make for us after school. 

Our desserts where amazing...we had the chocolate mouse cake that is in the shape of franks famous fadora hat and the most amazing pistachio gelato.  

They have a signature drink called the 'Sinatra Smash' and I will tell you it is smashing...

We are typically ""steak people"" instead of seafood/pasta but we just knew that anything coming out of Sinatra's kitchen would be delicious so we veered from our norms. We split the Caprese salad and I went with the Lobster Risotto and my wife ordered the Agnolotti, knowing we would probably trade plates halfway through. They also brought a variety of breads and butters/spreads - all delicious. The Caprese was a perfect example how simple ingredients can come together to be something outstanding. A variety of tomatoes and a great balsamic made this the best that I have had.

The lobster risotto came with large chunks of butter poached lobster and a light risotto in cream sauce. The Agnolotti were filled with cheese and soaked in an oil/basil sauce. We finished off the meal with the tiramisu recommended by our waiter which was exquisite.

I have absolutely no complaints. If you want to get real picky - it was a bit on the noisy side, but I prefer that sometimes.

The service was top notch and I was able to enjoy this all while sitting directly beneath a 6 foot tall painting of Old Blue Eyes. It doesn't get any better.",n88aZ3B8-8VsPeECSd92gQ,3,3,5,2cf7f4g6OoG5uqrr2ZIkSw

We didn't have reservations, so we walked in on a weeknight around 6:30pm. To start, we were served a basket of bread (some different loaves, bread sticks, and cheese crackers), along with butter with buds of basil (they tasted like that, anyway). They were just okay. 

I ordered chicken with mushrooms and gnocchi. The chicken was the most tender chicken I've probably ever had, but it was fairly bland.

I tried the scallops with cauliflower puree and blood orange. The scallops were AMAZING! Seared on the outside, buttery on the inside, and perfectly flavored. The cauliflower puree was a pleasant surprise. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but lighter with a gentle taste of cauliflower. 

My dad, who ordered the lobster risotto, said it was the most delicious risotto he's ever had. It came with large chunks of lobster on top, as would be expected for a $41 dish. 

All desserts are $12 and I tried the tiramisu as well as a pumpkin cake thing. The tiramisu -- which people seem to rave about -- was kind of watery. It was served in a big martini glass and the presentation was beautiful, but it tasted overly soggy. The pumpkin cake thing (I'm sure it has a fancy italian name I can't spell or pronounce) was average-tasting, but pretty to look at!

The service was great! Our wine and water glasses never went below half-full, the hostess was extremely friendly, and our waitress was extremely attentive without being intrusive.

After a day on the casino floor, we thought that we would end the day on a high note with dinner at Sinatra.  We called from the casino floor at 6:00 and was told that we could get right in if we did not wait until later.  Although this was a bit earlier than we would have liked, we hiked over to Encore for a fine meal.  As it turned out, it was OK, but no more satisfying than our gambling luck.

We were surprised to see that Steak Sinatra was no longer on the menu.  Our waiter checked to see if it could still be ordered  and was told that it was now called Filetto.  Since this was a different cut of meat and a peppercorn sauce would make it Steak Au Poivre, I knew my wife was going to end up with a meal that she did not expect.  I went with the lasagna because I was sure I knew what I would end up with.  Although the place was only half full, the order took some time.  That was fine with me.  It gave us time to enjoy the beautiful room, the wine and tasty antipasto.  Finally the entrees arrived.  A plain filet on a plain plate was place in front of my wife, the pepper sauce came in a small plain holder placed on the table.  My wife commented that for  $56 they could have at least placed some sort of garnish on the plate - or given her the 10 oz portion that was listed on the menu.  This looked more like 8 oz.   

The food was OK, but certainly not one of the better meals that we have enjoyed in Las Vegas.   The steak was very tender, but lacked flavor.  The peppercorn sauce did not save it.  The Lasagna was unremarkable.  There are too many exceptional Italian restaurants in Las Vegas to settle for such an average entree.  

Entrees, a side of veggies, a shared antipasto and a shared desert, a glass of wine and 2 martinis came out to $280 including the tip.  The cost was competitive with the other many high end Strip restaurants we have visited over the years, but the meal could not compete with most of them.",Tr1A93r_-k4_KNItcMHAJw,1,0,3,VGdGGyV4-iDHufsPLFqYSA

If you are looking to impress someone else, perhaps you should consider this restaurant. However if you go on vacation / business retreat with your own comfort in mind, you should probably go else where. The staff is rude and dismissive.  They have a total lack of class and interaction skills.  When we made reservations for this restaurant, they stated that they require collared shirts and nothing further.  However when we made it to the front, we were immediately refused service as my son had Tommy Bahamas shorts and a Burberry Polo (Imagine that....it was 119 degrees this past weekend).  The so-call restaurant manager had come out the front reception area, and stated that he would need to check with the hotel's senior management (Really....Over a 7 Year old?) if this could be permitted.  The manager walked behind a door behind reception, but I could see his refection in the glass, he just stood there and looked at his watch.  Five minutes later he stated that he could do nothing and he hated to loose out business but this came down from the top...no shorts for your 7 year old.  Mind you at this same time a lady in a tank mini dress made her way on in.  The manager told us that this was our fault and that his staff reads the reservations requirements from a script.  As they were on speaker phone when the reservations were made and not one of our company staff members heard this we are calling a spade a spade.  We had informed the hotel management of the situation, and they responded by telling (I think his last name was Fox), are you calling our hotel staff liars?....seriously!

These actions occurred in front of our office staff and was so classless we barely could put together words to articulate just how poorly restaurant acted. 

These guys are the worst....and the fact that they are so willing to play games over something so petty is beyond reason.  Steve Wynn needs to restaff. Bottom line, I don't know how good the food is, but I would sooner recommend seeing the soup Nazi!

We had 2 entrees - the chicken parmagiana and the lasagna.  The portions on the chicken parm was enough for 2 people.  Our waiter recommended we order a side of pasta because the chicken doesn't come with it.  The sauce on the pasta was flavorful, but there was so much chicken we really didn't need extra food to go with it.  My friend said the lasagna was the best she ever had.  After dinner they brought a free birthday dessert.  It was very pretty, but tasted absolutely horrible because there was coffee-flavored cake layered throughout and it was bitter and we couldn't eat it.

Each staff member greeted us with a smile. Our server Dina provided excellent service and was supported by several associates that filled the water glasses and removed the empty dishes.

We had a very comfortable 4 person table next to the life like portrait of Frank Sinatra. 
Dinner began with a nice selection of breads. Our favorite was the date raisin combination accompanied with a basil flower butter spread. 
The choice of appetizer was Panzanella which consisted of jumbo lump blue crab (really big pieces), brioche croutons, tomato and cucumber. Just a fantastic starter.

The entree of Branzino - Mediterranean Sea Bass was served on top of haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, tomato, yellow pepper emulsion salsa verde. This preparation of Branzino was the best I have ever experienced. The flavors were delightful and the fish filet was cooked to perfection.

Our  other entree a 10 oz beef tenderloin filet with cipollini onions and mushrooms in a red wine sauce. The steak was prepared as requested well done. However for a well done steak this one was as tender and juicy as one with pink inside. A superb piece of beef. 

Dessert was Tiramisu served in a bowl with large chocolate slices on top. It was moist and full flavored. 

The finale was 2 complementary Petit Four. A dark and a light chocolate.

3460509,2011-02-14,9,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"Definitely 5 stars. My review here is of the vegan menu at Sinatra. However, I should note that many dishes on the vegan menu are also found on the regular menu with slight alterations so I'm assuming taste and quality wise, we're all on the same page. 

When Chef Theo Schoenegger was given the task of creating a vegan menu, he didn't choose to treat that as a chore and create a menu chock full of salads and dishes a 2 year old could whip up. He obviously rose to the challenge and created a passionate menu with hearty vegan dishes. 

As a vegetarian, I avoid vegan entrees at Italian restaurants as I'm not a fan of vegan cheese and cream-less soups/pastas. Sinatra really wowed me with what they created within these boundaries. 

The vegan menu here is astonishing. There are 3 starters (a Caesar salad, a beet salad and a butternut squash soup). 2 pasta dishes and 3 main courses and 3 desserts. Some dishes use Gardein protein.

 We ordered the soup to share. A smooth, creamy (?) soup with a kick in it. Marinating in the soup were vegan ricotta cheese dumplings. Neither me nor my husband are fans of butternut squash but this soup hit the ball out of the park. 

For our second course (yes we did the Italian thing and had pasta and a main), we each ordered a pasta dish. My husband ordered the vegan ricotta cheese dumplings in an asparagus cream sauce. Divine. I didn't even realize the cheese was vegan. The asparagus cream sauce was light yet robust in flavors and when scooped up with the dumpling, it was the perfect explosion in my mouth. I ordered the Pennette. This is also on the regular menu. Tomato sauce and penne mixed with sweet peppers onions and Gardien Sausage. Yes....talk about comfort in a bowl. The generous helping was delicious and was definitely what I expected (if not better!). 

For our main, we shared a ""Chicken"" Marsala. A Gardein chicken breast that was baked and spiced was the main attraction on the plate. On top of it was a creamy, woody, mushroom (oyster) sauce that covered the chicken. Surrounding the ""chicken"" were billowy gnocchi that were smooth, simple and complemented the bold flavors of the sauce and chicken. Considering I've never had the opportunity to have a Marsala sauce since it's usually served with chicken, I take this first taste as being an exquisite experience. 

For the finale to the meal, we shared a Campari and citrus sorbet. Presented beautifully, it was a light ending to a perfect meal.

I don't really have to elaborate much about the ambiance and the service. This is the Encore and there was perfection executed all over. My favorite Italian experience thus far, has been at Aranciata Blu in Rome. Sinatra came so close to that experience that it was scary. I never thought I could enjoy such an ethereal experience just 20 minutes away from home.  

Vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore or whatever palate you have, Sinatra is a well worth-it experience. Oh, and the wine list here is also very impressive.

We were staying at the Encore and when making the reservation mentioned my friends birthday. As soon as we arrived and seated they handed him a birthday card.  Our waiter was so charming. We ordered the antipasto plate and the meatballs for appetizers which immediately erased the meal the night before.

For dinner, I had the chicken parmesan and he had the special tortellini with artichoke. They were like soft pillows. The chicken was amazing and stood alone.

For dessert we had the ricotta cheesecake which was light and airy.

I had one of two vegetarian options: a butternut squash pasta pocket (there's a better Italian word for this) in a brown butter and sage sauce. The sauce was completely flavorless, unfortunately. Butter + sage should make me want to lick the plate, especially at $30 a plate; this made me bored and still hungry. The wine selections, breads, and the ""skinny"" panna cotta were pretty good, though. Classy service redeemed the food a bit -- turns out I like my chair being pulled out for me -- and the ambiance is charming, with Sinatra films playing in the bar.",rqpfmzn97uBdi2pSyK6pwQ,1,0,3,5dGv36t5NagFY2LDLZpPKg

When the beau told me he was taking me to the new Sinatra @ the Encore for dinner I was delighted. There's nothing better than listening to Frank while enjoying a meal with great company. 

The ambiance - I liked it; I think Frank would approve. There were several pics of franks lining the walls. Of course Franks enchanting voice blasted in the background.. Delicious 
The drinks - 5 stars all the way. I sipped on a whiskey concoction suggested by the bartender. I don't recall the name but it has raspberries in it and it was fantastic!
Service - Top Notch!
Food: We started with the quartet of duck liver crostini, crudo (tuna with fennel, Mozzarella, and seasoned market vegetables.. ALL made to perfection!

3539632,2010-11-13,0,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"What would Frank Sinatra's favorite place to eat look like?

Sinatra is located in the Encore resort, adjacent and connected to the Wynn. Billed as a homage to Frank Sinatra and the only restaurant licensed to use his name, you are greeted at the entry by several of his awards including an Oscar and an Emmy. 

I had made reservations over the phone that afternoon but they had been lost. Luckily it was slow for a Friday night and we were able to be seated right away. The d√©cor is all designed to make the patron comfortable from the word go. The best description I can give is of a late 60s elegant living room. Not posh or fancy or casual, just comfortable elegance. Along one wall are floor to ceiling glass walls with a patio and outdoor fireplace just outside, all to evoke feeling of being in someone's home, perhaps at a dinner party with some celebrity friends dropping by. There are large portraits of Frank throughout, all beautifully lit. Not museum or gallery lighting, more homey than that.

The wine list is a bit pricey but offers a few sub-100 dollar bottles and the one we chose was very enjoyable. The menu is simple but there are 4-5 selections in each category of appetizers, pasta, fish, and meat. We each ordered appetizers including Prosciutto and Melon, Blue Crab Salad, and Butternut Squash Soup. All were good and the portion sizes were good to generous. There were two entr√©e specials but we decided to stick to the menu. The entrees took a while but we weren't in a hurry so it was fine. To be fair, the waiter had asked if we had any time restrictions such as a show and we said no. 

The Lobster Risotto was a bit bland so we asked for and promptly received some lemon wedges. The pasta with sausage and peppers was simple but good. The gnocchi stuffed with ricotta was also simple but good. The major exception was desert. We ordered a gelato selection that was very good and a Tiramisu that was truly excellent. No matter how many times you've had Tiramisu in other restaurants, this one gives new definition to the word 'smooth'. After your first bite, you'll know what I mean.

The service was attentive but not over the top. You'll never have to ask for your water to be refilled, your waiter will always be easily accessible, and any special dietary requests such as food allergies or special preparations will be quickly and graciously handled. You will not have your refolded napkin waiting for you when you return from the bathroom. Your wine glass won't automatically be refilled every time it reaches the half way mark. 

And there in lies the rub of the restaurant. I suspect that many come here with expectations of grandeur at every turn. This is not and will never be a haven for foodies the world over. You will not get a Michelin 3-Star like impression of the selection or the food. You will not be hovered over by staff anticipating your every move, attending to you like royalty. 

At the end of the day, this restaurant was designed to pay homage to one man. As Steve Wynn says on the first page of the menu, ""I think this is the kind of place he would dig"".  So what do you envision Sinatra's favorite evening with food and drink to look like? 
For me, Sinatra was a man's man; a guy who enjoyed good food, good drinks and above all, good company. He enjoyed being comfortable with a certain easy elegance. That is the key to this place. Come with a desire to relax and enjoy an evening with a few good friends. Sit down, relax, get comfortable, and let it all happen. It's all designed to be comfortable and let you and your guests get to know each other and enjoy a special 
evening. I'm sure Frank had many an evening like this and I'm sure Steve Wynn is right; Frank would have dug this place.",bCglPCiltb6206DVttvvBw,1,1,4,Ae5W2OAUf7iZQTXGHH-piA

Fine Italian Vegan dining? Check! Beautiful ambiance? Check! Soft background mood music? Umm... Yes, if you dig Sinatra music.

Upon being seated by our hostess, I displayed my redneck charm by assisting her while turning the table to seat us. I didn't realize what she was doing as it's customary in these ""fine dining"" establishments to turn the table a bit to allow the lady to sit down, then turn it back. I thought she knew we wanted to sit on the same side and was turning it to accommodate us. Once she realized that was my thought, she quickly offered to seat us in a booth, side by side. Very nice of her.

The service other than the hostess was a bit substandard. I could see the dollar signs dimming in the eyes of our waitress when we told her we would be declining the drink menu. Yes, I know this was my first trip to Vegas where I stayed near completely sober... When we requested the Vegan menu, she knew our bill wasn't going to reach the point where her take would be $20 or more. From that point on, she offered the minimum amount of service possible while pasting on a phony smile.

The exquisite food all made up for it once it was rolled out. The Chick-non Marsala brought me back to childhood when my mom would fry up some chicken breast in the ol' electric skillet, using her patented blend of Lawry's seasoning. It was one of the most authentically meaty tasting dishes I've had in 16+ years. If that's your thing, this dish is for you! Although it was slightly on the salty side, that's ok for me since I crave sodium as much as my body craves water. This sumptuous chick-non patty was laid on a bed of my favorite pasta, gnocchi. This created a meal, that was nearly worth it's $33 price tag. I can really get used to eating smaller portions when they taste this amazing.

The beet salad was good with various types of beets laid out artfully in a rectangular platter. It was a little pricey at $14 but worth ordering if you're a fan of the beets like we are.

The Cioccolato we ordered for dessert was a cocoa powder covered delight. Definitely order a coffee with this one to soak up all that chocolate flavor. Just don't order a latte. I'm not sure they make them here. They brought out something resembling espresso with steamed milk, yet it wasn't a latte as I'm used to. Maybe go for their cappuccino instead since I think they would do a better job at that. This is a dessert that is meant to be savored, so if you're feeding your partner, take it slowly...

Sinatra is where the true ""High Rollers"" come to eat http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sinatra-las-vegas#Q_78_I5-KnUrRsAqFrJ1mg You won't have to worry about remembering any of ol' Blue Eyes greatest hits, as they'll play softly in the background, all while you dine in classy, elegant style. It's nice to see how the other half lives, if only for one meal.

If you have a special someone in your life that loves Italian food, but just so happens to be Vegan, take them to Sinatra. You may just make their day as special as they are themselves.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,10,9,4,VmVbfXJEbSSc447zzVddng

When I first checked in for my table, it was ready and the hostess showed me the way. Now, for a guy like me, from a small town no one has ever heard of in the Mid-West, this next moment impressed me so much and re-assured me that this was going to be an exceptional dinner. My waiter for the evening, came up to me at my table, and said, ""Good Evening Mr. Bedtka. how are you doing tonight?"" That blew my mind, first that he pronounced my name correctly, but that that kind of service exists that they take the time to greet you like that. After my drink order, I looked over the menu, and found the meatballs and polenta fries. Absolutely the best meatballs i have had and the fries were light, warm and airy. For my entree, i selected the Ossobuco ""My Way"". Love the title for this dish, probably my favorite Sinatra song lol. It was so tender that put my knife back down and only used my fork for the whole dish. The risotto was cooked perfectly, so creamy and flavorful. The decor, created by Roger Thomas, is so beautiful and full of Sinatra portraits.

Upon arrival we sat at the bar where they had High Society playing on a large flat panel above the bar. It was a playful atmosphere and I enjoyed looking out to the patio area that had fireplaces, trees wrapped in white lights as well as heat lamps. Everyone inside & out seemed to be having a fun evening. 

Shortly after arriving we were promptly seated in a large dining area~ not very intimate as I was hoping but nice nonetheless. Our server was very efficient in taking our order which included the Polpettine (meatballs & polenta fries) appetizer for my husband and the Panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomatoes, cucumber with tomato fonduta) for myself. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meatballs and we were both surprised how much we enjoyed the polenta fries which I've never had before. My appetizer arrived looking much different than I visualized but I truly enjoyed the large pieces of blue crab as well as the tomato fonduta. We leisurely enjoyed our appetizers also partaking of the breadbasket & sipping our drinks. For our main entr√©es my husband had the  Lasagne Bolognese that arrived in a oval tin and initially wasn't sure how to ""dig in"". However, once started he said it was a very flavorful lasagna and was very pleased with his selection. I had Frank's Spaghetti & Clams which was served in a bowl overflowing with clams. The clams were cooked to perfection - tender and not chewy & the pasta was al dente how I like it. The only thing that needed some ""help"" was the tomato garlic broth which was a bit too mild and needed a bit more seasoning. 

Our server  who seemed a bit overwhelmed with a very large party and several smaller parties did his best to be attentive however, he took my empty cocktail glass never asking if I would like another. So, I didn't get another scrumptious pear martini until we finished our meal. 

Once the table was cleared the server brought a small plate of various chocolates, biscotti and a piece of caramel which was soft & melt-in-your-mouth yummy.

3889830,2009-03-09,1,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"A very upscale italian restaurant riding off the coattails of Frank Sinatra's image, Sinatra at the Encore is a good example of Italian haute cuisine.

The dress code is business casual, with almost all the men wearing jackets and boots and women also dressing up as well. However I went in with a clean pair of tennis shoes, nice jeans, a collared shirt under a sweater and it was fine.

I was with family and we ordered two appetizers to share and  5 different entrees.

Bread is served and you get your choice of individual baguettes, raisin and nut bread, or fennel bread. All three weren't very impressive, fresh, and in fact were dissapointing. The presentation of the butter however was excellent as it was already warmed for spreading.

The appetizers:

We ordered the Tonnato, slivers of tuna fish served raw and with roe and drizzled with oil. It came with a side of sauce that was I believe made from the fish and it was absolutely incredible. It's highly aerated, and looks like creamy but has this nutty, beautifully subtle umami flavor to it. I'm currently on a mission to find out how to make it myself... it'll probably require some machinery to be honest to aerate it that perfectly.

The other appetizer was the polpettine, meatballs and cubes of polenta. The meatballs were soft but didn't have any special flavor to them. They were nice and crumbly without being mealy and were savory. The polenta was excellent though And I liked it's multiple textures. It had a visible crust topside and bottom, a firm, much lighter crust on its sides, but it had a very soft crumbly center that melts in your mouth.

The entrees:

We ordered the rigatoni, risotto, a pasta dish called the chitarra, and I had a dry-aged New York steak.

The rigatoni is made with a tomato-cream sauce with a hint of cheese, fresh basil, and big huge fresh shrimp. This dish was good, and this is a nice fancy restaurant, but it was overpriced to death. 30 bucks for rigatoni pasta that doesn't taste any better than supermarket Barilla is a bit of a dissapointment.

The risotto came with baked Main lobster and it was absolutely delicious. The lobster was succulent and sweet, the risotto was reduced and flavored just right to compliment it.

The chitarra is a spaghetti dish with ""hand-rolled spaghetti"" that again tastes like it was out of a box. At least it was a perfect al-dente. It's made in a cream-based wild-mushroom saute and seasoned with chives. They screwed up this dish by making it a bit too salty and we had it taken back. When it came back, it came back suspiciously quick (especially when we were told it would be remade), and I tasted it and realized they just dumped more sauce into it to dilute it. Must've been premade.

And finally, to my steak. I had a gorgeous 14oz New York strip cooked medium rare, and it was exactly that, cooked in a broiler, great crust all throughout. The dry-aged beef was delicious, the flavor was exquisite as it let out more as I kept chewing. I especially loved how the fattier edges contrasted with the leaner center. Just great. It came with a side of potatoes and some wild mushrooms, but those were just a speck in the meal. My steak was fantastic.

The service here is nothing short of exemplary for a true fine dining restaurant. I would definitely come here again, but then again this is a town where there are just too many fine-dining restaurants to try to stick to one place. That, and overall I wasn't impressed with some of the food despite the prestige that seems to hype up this restaurant. I was happy with my meal, but for the price you pay here (think 40 bucks a person, average. Safely 50) you expect nothing short of a home run.",KALFqsKmnRL6oyxlwd10bQ,1,1,4,HFdridOxAEpUw2qSOipQkQ

3948417,2009-11-24,4,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"There's no other word to describe this place other than ""elegant"". Sheer elegance. With the almighty Sinatra's awards displayed for all patrons to see, golden curtains draping across the windows to the beautifully lit outdoor patio, and a cozy, intimate feel in the dining room, there's no wonder Encore guests deem this to be one of the most alluring restaurants to dine at.

Swoon to Frank's biggest hits as you sip on a glass of wine or one of their specialty cocktails. The bellini was peachy sweet and smooth. A bit heavy on the peach puree, but just the right amount of bubbly. Everything about this venue is classy, including the menus. A soft glossy binder with a very simple selection of pastas, meat, and seafood - I've never admired such immense detail in a restaurant.

Being forewarned by previous diners, I decided to split an order of the chicken parmigiana and a side of penne pasta with my gal pal. Originally, the side was supposed to be spaghetti, but I asked our waiter if we could substitute it to any other pasta and penne was on the list. 

The chicken was superb! Moist and tender, but not overly drenched in tomato sauce. The mozzarella was baked to a browned ooey gooey perfection and just melted in my mouth. I tried a taste of my friend's chicken saltimbocca (prosciutto wrapped chicken breast w/ asiago & sage) which was rich in flavor, but the prosciutto was overcooked and didn't melt onto the chicken. The capesante (seared Maine diver scallops) was my favorite dish of the evening. 4 plump scallops crispy on the outside, firm and chewy on the inside. The chef did a wonderful job searing each piece perfectly. 

The only factor that caused Sinatra to fall short of a 5-star review was that the prices were waaay overpriced for what you're getting. But I suppose it's true when they say you're paying for the ambiance. For Italian influenced cuisine, I don't believe 2 slices of chicken parmigiana should cost $30...no matter how delicious they were. 

Regardless, I'd come back. I'll just have to work extra hard at the tables before walking through the front door though.",Nn-hLgYTKNkJQ-G7LSXG3g,6,5,4,4rCuKaib5EyzMdnK8nIyFw

Prosciutto (Parma prosciutto, caramelized Bartlett pears,
Parmigiana Reggiano) Best prosciutto I've ever had.. The caramelized pears and cheese were also very delicious. 

Dinner:
Lasagna Bolognese- The bolognese was extremly flavorful and the meat was very tender. Best bolognese I've ever had. 

Chicken Parmigiana- Best chicken parm ever! Huge portions and the chicken was melt in your mouth. The marinara sauce was SO good.

expectations were so high. Sinatra exceeded them. 
We went with another couple on Superbowl weekend. Our reservations were 
for 6:30. We arrived promptly and were seated immediately. There weren't 
many other people dining at that time. However, by the time we left 
every table was occupied and there was a line out the door waiting. 
I knew it was gong to be a good night when they were able to offer some 
better vodkas for my martini. I had Ciroq. Last month when I ate at 
Carnevino they were excited to offer Grey Goose. (please, no thank you) 
I do not drink wine, but our friends did. They were pleased with the 
list and found a red that they both enjoyed. 
For appetizers, I had the scallop with celery and kumquats. Fabulous! 
It simply melted in my mouth. The combination of flavors was 
exceptional. Get this! My husband had the romaine salad with lemon 
vinaigrette dressing. We both thought it was fabulous. I loved the 
anchovy croutons, he was not really a fan of them. 
Three different breads were served. All of them were great. My favorite 
was the cheese. The olive was interesting and worth a taste. Be 
careful not to fill up on these. It is very easy to do. They were 
yummy. 
For dinner, I ordered the John Dory fillet. I read other reviews here 
and it seemed to be consistently great. It held true for me. It was by 
far the best of our 4 meals. It was cooked to perfection. Again the 
combination of flavors was perfect. I loved the truffle sauce and 
asparagus. 
My husband ordered the shrimp rigatoni. It was OK. Of the four meals it 
was our least favorite. There was nothing special about it. The red 
sauce was average. 
Our friends ordered the New York steak and the evenings pork special. 
Both were great. The steak was served black and blue. I am not really a 
fan of steak and this won my heart. The pork special was also very 
tasty. We ordered side dishes of mushroom saute and vegetable 
ratatouille. When I placed the order I asked the server if there would 
be enough for the table since we wanted to share the mushrooms. He said 
absolutely and they would be served family style. Well, this was not 
the case. The portions were only enough for one person. We immediately 
asked him to bring more when he served them. I am accustomed to fine dining portions but 
was surprised how small of a portion the side dished were. The mushrooms 
were wonderful. Actually I could have had 2 scallops and a side of 
mushrooms as a meal. Maybe they should put that on the menu. 
We decided to order dessert as well. We ordered the bomboloni and 
cappello. I liked the bomboloni better, but both were delightful. I 
would definitely suggest you save room for both of these. 
Service was wonderful through out the entire evening. I pick this over

pressed to choose. Both were well worth every penny!",HkwVxpcbX6fFlKMXNZCuNQ,1,2,5,SasTtAr5bZunugdCR0Kcgg

We opted to sit outside as it was a beautiful evening and pretty much had the whole patio to ourselves for almost our whole meal. There are just 6 tables outside in the garden area and there are heaters and a firepit/fireplace that help to keep the chill off. 

For starters we had the Polpettini ..(the housemade meatballs with polenta fries) and the Panzanella con Granchio ... (jumbo lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomato, 
cucumber, tomato fonduta) .. both appetizers were presented beautifully and were quite tasty. There were nice sized morsels of the crab which complemented the Panzanella very well. The only thing I really didn't care for were the polenta fries which I found to be a bit on the bland side.

Then came the main course .. my dinner partner ordered the Lasagna Bolognese (fresh pasta layered with veal, pork and beef rag√∫) which he said was almost as good as his mom's. :) I chose the Veal Parmigiana (thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce) .. which ended up being gigantic. It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, just the right amount of breading, sauce and cheese. DELICIOUS! It was every bit as delicious for lunch the next day as well. 

Even though we were both stuffed after the entrees, we definitely wanted to try dessert and boy were we glad. The Tiramisu was spectacular and we both quickly forgot how full we were :) ..

During dinner, we reminisced about Sinatra and Sinatra Jr--and their friends and family.  You can just feel the presence, frankly.

They offer several types of bread & crackers served with fruity extra-virgin olive oil.  Balsamic vinegar can be ordered to accompany the extra-virgin olive oil.  Try not to overindulge in bread since you don't want to ruin your appetite.  To wet our appetite, we ordered a round of Under the Tuscan Sun drinks: a cocktail with vodka and a mixture of juices.  It reminded me of a mix of a sunrise and a seabreeze.  We ordered: Caprese, Capponatina, Lasagna Bolognese, Tagliata (bone-in ribeye with eggplant parmasan), and Ossobuco.  This meal was one of the best that I've ever had in Las Vegas.  The dishes come out piping hot and are worth the wait.   The food was delicious and the meat was tender.  The tomatoes in the caprese were a mix of heirloom, cherry, & hothouse; some of them were not as ripe as they should have been, but overall it was good because of the soft Buffalo mozzarella.  The ossobuco and gremalata was so soft and juicy.  The ribeye was the perfect tender medium rare.  The lasagna would make you cry, it's so good.  

This place is swanky!  It's like stepping into another era.  The furnishings are impressive: reminiscent of 1950s old Hollywood, bright, stylish and bold.  There is a dress code, but nothing too restrictive.  Sinatra's music is piped throughout the restaurant.  Overall, an enjoyable experience.

Husband and I had dropped the ball making reservations for dinner on a Friday night.  Nothing looked available on Opentable.  Thank goodness for the concierge at the Encore.  She recommended Sinatra (which I knew Nothing about) and called up and made us a reservation within 10 minutes.

When it comes to restaurants in Vegas, my expectations are low.  I find places loud, crowded, gaudy, overpriced & overhyped.  

As we approached the restaurant, located in the Encore, we saw photos & awards of Frank.  (They need photos of Frank & Ava; they looked damn good together.)

We were immediately greeted and taken to a quiet intimate table.  There were people, but they were far away.  Privacy at a Vegas restaurant?  Spectacular.  The decor made one nostalgic for the Vegas Rat Pack days.  There are giant photos of Frank and they had his music playing (yes, I'm a fan and have his greatest hits on my iTunes).  Its simple, yet elegant.

Then, I don't know if the host was the manager, but he stayed and chit chatted with us for about 10 minutes.  Between the decor, music & personable host, we were relaxed and in quite the amorous mood.  

A bottle of Chianti-Very Good
Caprese-thought this was standard but was really craving it
Insalatina Dell Imperatore-they do Caesar salad right w/anchovy 
Ossobuco My Way-Very Good (but a big portion and couldn't even come close to finishing)

Therefore, it was quite a surprise to me when, upon browsing through the food recommendation section of the Encore Hotel & Casino entertainment book this past weekend, that my gaze settled upon a little place called ""Sinatra"" - and I wanted to go there!

My date and I arrived and of course, since it was a Sunday, I didn't make reservations. There simply isn't a need and this was in fact evident based on the number of folks there.

For pre-dinner drinks we selected The Dream - a signature cocktail - and a glass of sauvignon blanc. Nothing special here.

I've been on an appetizer kick lately, sampling only appetizers. I feel this allows me to sample the most items and I can also closely meter how much food I'm eating. 

We started with a lovely basket of parmesan breadsticks, parmesan flatbread, and whole wheat bread. It was good, but honestly, nothing special. 

After we moved on to the mains. 

Polpettine - housemade meatballs with polenta fries. The housemade meatballs were OK. Ikea meatballs are slightly better IMO, but....THE POLENTA FRIES! They were soooo good. In fact, I would order this dish again in a heartbeat just for them.

Frank's Clams Posilipo - clams in tomato sauce with garlic and oregano. Delicious. Exactly what I expected. Flawlessly executed. 

My date got the Agnolotti, which is small pasta pockets filled with bufala ricotta, herbs, asparagus sauce. It was rich, but truly sublime. Small pockets of pasta, with a delicate sauce, that explode perfectly in your mouth as you eat them. 

Due to the fact that we had bottle service somewhere after we declined to eat further, but I can only imagine. I expect to be back here in December when I return to the Encore.",-c9G-JHNqrPY0_UU9j7BJA,3,0,4,0VUGZ28WR0CeUaU8Mt-68A

4301676,2009-03-03,1,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"Sinatra is an excellent restaurant in Steve Wynn's new luxury tower suites hotel at Encore. I have the Yelp community to help steer me towards Sinatra, so thank you Yelp! Quick story; I was in Las Vegas for my mom's 65th birthday and were looking for a restaurant to help celebrate. Originally my aunt made reservations at Switch, another restaurant at Encore. However, I researched Switch on Yelp and saw that it had a 2 star review at the time =X I suggested we try somewhere else and I came across Sinatra on Yelp. The 4 1/2 star review seemed appealing and thus suggested Sinatra. To say the least, I was now nervous because the burden now came onto me. However, at the end of the evening, Sinatra did NOT disappoint, and my mom was very happy with her meal and experience =)

Onto the details.

The ambiance and atmosphere at Sinatra was of class. A modern decor with a hint of old-Italian, combined with high ceilings, chandeliers, a huge portrait of Ol Blue Eyes himself, and a view of the flower garden created a feeling of elegance. Even the chairs were impressive, as if it were a throne itself. However, the beautiful hostess and staff helped each patron to their seats, and hence our night began.

The service at Sinatra is what really blew me away. Our waiter, Michael, was very amiable and down-to-earth. His portly stature, combined with his friendly personality, almost made me call him Uncle Mikey! Although you might expect a bit of pretentiousness at such a classy restaurant, Michael certainly dispelled that notion. He welcomed us to Sinatra and provided us with a quick description about the restaurant, as well as award-winning Chef Theo Schoenegger. As Michael described, Sinatra is obviously an Italian restaurant. However, Chef Theo approached the menu by taking classic Italian dishes and utilized reverse-culinary engineering to deconstruct the ingredients. He then implements his influence to these dishes to create a modern feel to classic Italian selections. That said, he elegantly went over the menu, giving a brief description of the dishes he recommends. After hearing Michael's monologue, I must say, I was excited!

While waiting for our food to arrive, my dad brought a bottle of wine for the table, a 2005 Caymus Special Selection. I believe the corkage fee was around $40? After Michael took our orders, the sommelier (or wine steward) quickly came to our table and asked if we'd like our wine to be placed in a decanter. After saying yes, we observed this wine master at work, delicately pouring the wine from its original bottle into the decanter, then taking the bottle close to a lighted candle, to observe if any sediments were left. After a few minutes of allowing the wine to aerate and breathe within the decanter, she sampled the wine to taste for any tannins. Deemed ready. she brought our wine to the table, and after witnessing all that, it made the wine even more enjoyable! We actually just came from Napa Valley and consumed much wine during that trip (as expected haha), so my dad and I were having a conversation with her. She was very charming and answered many of our wine-related questions, so that was nice.

Okay, onto the food. Sorry for the wait! For appetizers we decided to share amongst the 5 of us. We ordered two orders of each: the Assaggini Di Mare ( a quartet of the sea), the Polpettine (meatballs with polenta and mushrooms), and the Cappesante (seared Maine scallops). I didn't have much of the sea quartet, but I can definitely vouch for the Polpettine and Cappesante! The meatballs were bursting with flavor, as well as the scallops. Together with celery and kumquat fruits, the diverse combination with the scallops produced a refreshing taste to my palate, as the kumquat complimented the scallops well, while the celery acted as the bridge to put the two tastes together.

I ordered the ravioli (with butternut squash, vanilla, and amaretto) for my second choice. I was a bit disappointed in the taste, for it was a bit bland for my palate. Perhaps it was the butternut squash? The vanilla foam on top, however, was a nice touch to the ravioli. My dad recommended the Agnolotti (with ricotta and herbs, parmesan sauce and chives), so maybe next time.

For my main course I ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb, along with a side of mashed Yukon Gold potato. Yum! The lamb was so tender and flavorful! The meat tasted so delicate, it was literally hanging by a thread off of the meat. The potato puree was an excellent compliment to the lamb, which was suggested by Michael. I'm not sure how Chef Theo did it, but you have to try the meat and see for yourself!

For dessert, I had the bread pudding with gelato. The contrasting flavors and temperatures made the end of my dining experience even more enjoyable!

Overall, I greatly enjoyed my experience at Sinatra and highly recommend! This is no themed restaurant in a casino, this is fine Italian dining at its best!

P.S. Sorry for the long review =X lol",yNGVBrRE9fTFwTuz-soI3A,1,1,5,hjezHF7GoNjuIn_OQ0xDAg

We were greeted nicely and escorted to pick between tables, we settled for a fireside setting for 4, post getting seated a lady comes out, Kelly, aka senior restaurant manager, who is all about taking care of her seldom rollers while never showing any attention to good clientele. She pretends to be super nice while never accommodating with any of your needs. Furthermore, she backtracks what her staff says and end up putting us in a corner claiming it's a VIP table. Basically we get escorted off the table we got seated on to be placed in between a drunk crowd while our table is taken over by 2 people that feel like chilling post their dinner. 

To be fair, the food is scrumptious but service is key in any high end restaurant. It's a combination of things, if I were to give any macaron aka Etoi, I would never do so given the attitude of the management. 

 Kelly is the worst manager Steve WYNN ever hired. Too bad the man who knows everyone and everything about hospitality hires such a shady manager. A great dinner turning into a nightmare.

===

I am honored to review the heavenly nirvana that is Sinatra at Encore. That a restaurant could be so well composed only two weeks after opening is otherworldly. Clearly the gods have shone on this mansion of Olympus.

Reservations are required. Dress is extremely up; don't embarrass yourself by even walking into this hotel without a jacket or donned in high European couture: the splendour of the decor absolutely demands your highest respect. Gloriously beautiful butterfly mosaics guide your way highlighted by the RED red chandeliers above (did I mention that they are red?). You may pass by some disappointed fanny-packed, windbreakered walk-ups, turned away without a reservation as you take your seat atop a stool, one of just seven at the bar. Old blue eyes is serenading you as you are about to embark on the swankiest dinner of a thousand lifetimes.

I ordered my Dubonnet Manhattan and was proud to be the first pour from the newly unsealed bottle. History. Should have been real cherries, but I'm too overwhelmed to fuss. Hostess arrives to escort us... Hmm, not what I'd expect for the look in a swanky Maitre'd but again, I'm not fussing. I get to sit under this gigantic portrait of the man himself.

Every detail is supreme. The royal orchids table arrangement and linen-topped oil lamp shade masking the flickering flame within. The embroidered artwork of butterflies on silk napkins. The lushly textured orange tablecloth (how can I have a shirt made from that material?!?) and the orange piping framing the absolutely white seat cushions.

The wine list is eclectic and mostly complete. A wonderfully huge Amarone awaits our dessert and just champagne cocktails for now.

Lobster raviolis are absolute perfection. Mixed with buttery tomatoes, so fine. The ossobucco melts in your mouth, the marrow the finest I have ever had. I was so deeply moved that I wished hard that I might be able to pay homage to the chef; I was lucky enough to be able to present my thanks personally, but that's a story for the memoirs.

They even made my favorite dessert to accompany the vanilla gelato. Strawberries, mint and balsamic vinegar. Was there a hint of pepper?

4402141,2017-05-06,3,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"After consuming so many serious dinners in Las Vegas this week (at Jo√´l¬†Robuchon, Momofuku, Jos√© Andr√©s' Bazaar Meat, Mizumi, etc.), Sinatra was meant to be my ""fun meal,"" an excuse to shovel comfort food down my throat without thinking too much about it.

Mea culpa, I significantly underestimated this restaurant. Sinatra ended up being one of my favorite (top 3?) meals in Las Vegas this week.

My experience started on a nice note: a thick gazpacho was provided as an Amuse Bouche -- and, as one would expect in an Italian-American restaurant, Sinatra's gazpacho was more ""saucy"" than the classic Andalusian preparation -- heavier on tomato than on olive oil, though nonetheless tasty.

Next, a basket of four different different breads was placed on the table, accompanied by softened chive butter: Ciabatta Rolls, Olive Focaccia, Jack Daniels Date Bread, and crispy Parmesan Lavash. My favorite was the lavash, which tasted somewhat familiar -- think Cheez-Its, but with the parmesan cheese imparting just enough funk to make it acceptable for grown-ups. The date bread may have been a bit too sweet to serve before a meal, and the olive focaccia tasted like it was made with jarred cocktail olives rather than the freshly marinated olives I know Vegas is capable of.

The first course I ordered at Sinatra was the Polipo ($22), which featured octopus in a roasted red pepper emulsion. This was the best part of the meal for me -- of particular delight was the tenderness of the octopus which, according to my waiter, is due to the octopus being vigorously beaten after it is caught and before its muscles tighten up. (I have a running theory that no two chefs tenderize their octopus the same way, which is why I always get a different answer when I ask.) The red pepper sauce served with the octopus was umami-rich, and featured fried capers with a crispy texture, providing a nice contrast to the soft Mediterranean octopus.

My next course was Pennette Pasta ($18 - half-sized) with a rag√π of Italian sausage, bell peppers, and basil. The sausage rag√π sauce was good, somewhat sweet, though heavy with fennel and with enough of a trace of hot pepper to have a bite. Pasta was cooked al dente which may seem a bit under-cooked to most American sensibilities (e.g., opinions formed by consuming baked pasta dishes from the local sub shop) -- but is really the only sensible way to prepare pasta. I suspect for this reason we have Yelp reviews complaining about over-cooked or under-cooked pasta at Sinatra. I strongly suspect these assertions are utter nonsense -- the pasta on my plate was cooked perfectly.

So... yeah, don't believe all of the reviews on Yelp. Some people are complaining about ""bland"" food from Sinatra while ordering meatballs. One person expressed that she wishes she were served ""chicken parm"" rather than Veal Parmigiana. Another guy implies his ""chicken over mashed potatoes"" was nothing special. (OK, this one is on the restaurant -- serving that entr√©e is like giving a gun to a chimp.) 

My final course was the Veal Ossobuco ($53). Ossobuco and Saffron Risotto was a dish I made regularly for near-strangers when I was in the dating pool a decade ago, before I met my vegetarian wife. It's easy to prepare, looks more impressive than it is, and generates an unmistakable ""wow factor."" Because of this, I am often nervous about ordering this dish out. I'm glad to report that Sinatra's version stands up favorably to the best ossobuco I ever made. The size of the dish was also quite substantial -- the shank they brought out for me was gigantic. I much enjoyed swirling the fork-tender meat around to pick up more veal broth reduction and lip-smacking collagen. The accompanying risotto had perfect texture and a generous amount of saffron (but not so much that the rice tasted like detergent, an error that lesser restaurants have made). The only complaint that I have is that the gremolata was nearly non-existent, and definitely not a factor in the dish. In such a heavy dish, gremolata helps as a brightening agent. On recommendation of my waiter, I paired the ossobuco with the silky 2011 Masi Costasera Amarone ($28), which was a delicious, medium-bodied wine that paired perfectly with the veal.

Speaking of my server, Sergio treated me like royalty. He was on top of the meal, made a myriad of recommendations, and provided valuable color commentary throughout. I can't say enough good things about the service I received. If you go to Sinatra and end up with a waiter half as good as Sergio, you'll still rave about the service.

For food reasons I may normally rate Sinatra a 4, but this was the quintessential Vegas dining experience. With its top-notch service and beautiful venue, Sinatra surpassed my expectations, and provided a truly delightful meal that anyone who enjoys food would love.

4781542,2009-01-29,1,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"Sinatra ""popped my cherry""!  My YELP cherry that is...

Sinatra in the new Encore hotel in Las Vegas is hands down worthy of my first review, after much thought about which establishment would be my introduction to this community.

I recently celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and I heard that Steve Wynn celebrated his birthday there a week prior with a host of celebrities and multi-millionaires including the ""Donald"" himself.  Anything good enough for the owner of the hotel is good enough for me.

Here is the review...enjoy

Type: Sinatra's is a modern take on classic Italian.

Atmosphere: The decor and ambiance can only be described as classic elegance.  The sounds of Sinatra filled the very large main dining room in a pleasant and subtle way and was by no means overbearing or too powerful.  I could easily enjoy conversation throughout dinner with my date.  Large chandeliers and a photo of Frank stood out in the main room.  I particularly enjoyed the high decorated ceilings and large windows that looked out into the patio dining and garden area.  The carpet was a little much, but with the amazing view of the garden and the delicious food in front of me my focus wasn't on my feet.

Staff: We were greeted at the restaurant like we were VIPs and immediately shown to our table by the gracious hostess.  As fine dining should be various staff members were on point to take our order, bring our order, and refill our drinks.  Jonathan, our sommelier, recommended an amazing Italian wine (which name excapes me at the moment) based on what we told him we were looking for and it paired nicely with the Ossabuco.  The food was delivered with precision and immpeccable timing as our silverware was switched per course.  

Food: AMAZING! Pretty much that describes the overall satisfaction from my dining experience.  3 choices of fresh baked bread were served along with butter and I must recommend the Asiago bread.

First Course: Tonnata - blue fin tuna served ""carpaccio"" style with thin slices of tuna topped with finely selected seasonings.  The tonnata literally melted in your mouth and left your palette craving for more.

*we ordered originally the Capisante - Maine diver scallops, but was informed from the waiter that the scallops were turned down by the kitchen due to receiving a poor quality batch.  I really appreciated this as this shows the high standard and quality control that Sintra has.

Entree: Ossobuco ""My Way"" with risotto.  This also was pretty tasty and finely prepared.  The meat was cooked just right and the portion was generous.

San Pietro - John Dory fillet with gnochi.  Prepared nicely and the white fish was soft and left no hints of the ""fishy"" taste that is sometimes found with fish dishes.  The fresh fish was complemented nicely with the gnochi as well.

My favorite dish of the evening was the Ravioli.  The butternut squash ravioli was perfect and possibly the best pasta dish I have ever had!  The flavors of the squash mixed with the vanilla foam that was layered on top was pure heaven in my mouth. 

Dessert: I was able to get quite a sampling of the desserts and I must say they were all pretty tasty.  The Bomboloni - warm little donuts filled with dark chocolate were amazing!

I was very impressed with this restaurant and will definitely go back.

Sinatra would be proud...",nGBnKNR7o7VxGhznyr6LAg,2,3,5,Ri_cwXb43mI1n8dcEx1VYg

Yes we are in our twenties, but we were there to spend money. Don't assume because we look younger than the average clientele that we are not going to tip, because that is not the case.

4818889,2016-01-07,5,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"As far as dining options in the Wynn/Encore go, Sinatra isn't my favorite.

I'm a big fan of Frank Sinatra (who isn't?!), so of course I immediately loved the concept - an Italian restaurant paying homage to him. Seeing Frank's coveted award memorabilia at the front was a great touch as we waited to be seated. The ambiance in general was immaculate (as it tends to be in Steve Wynn's newer hotels). Everything else was pretty forgettable.

We started out with the tuna tartare appetizer. I enjoyed it (the fish quality was great) but the portion was super tiny. My aunt and I opted to split the massive 20 oz. ribeye for our main course - it was pretty good, but I've had better. Overall, the food was solid. The real glaring flaw was the service. It was dismally slow, and we felt pretty neglected for most of the meal. It took quite a while for our meals to come out - I want to say about 35 minutes. That's fine, I get that making meals from scratch takes time, but no one checked up on us even once during that time, and we proceeded to get full off the bread basket (sigh). 

Overall, if you poke around, there are much better fine dining options in the hotel, on The Strip, and beyond. I can't wholeheartedly recommend this one.",nOPhkKDM-0-UfIinPS758g,11,5,3,xt1lyWJ8ywxguSY6bJMBrg

We arrive at the restaurant which is nicely appointed I might add.  Orange table cloths and wonderful pictures of Sinatra in all his glory.  Being a huge ""Frank"" fan I'm loving it..  Lots of Sinatra music and a few ""Rat Pack"" sessions so I am thinking all is good.  Drinks were outstanding..  Time to be seated..  Well, let's just say the 'No Problem' request went out the door..  Ended up at a table near the entrance.  Seems the table in the area we wanted was given to someone else.. I asked about the ""no problem table' but after a few minutes of that ""I don't care/can't do anything for you/just take a seat"" stare from the hostess I figured there was no sense in pursuing the issue..  Not the way to kick off an anniversary celebration..  Moving on..  Waiter appears; runs down specials; hands dinner and drink menu along with wine list; advises who our waiter will be and promptly vanishes.  We sit.. We wait..  We sit..  We wait..

Another 20 minutes and drinks appear.!  Order appetizers which were actually quite good.  Bread Salad with Crab was very nice as were the meatballs.  The polenta sticks were not my favorite..  Rather dull..  Main course of Chicken Parmesan which was mediocre at best and didn't stand out..  Eggplant Parmesan as a side was good..  Side of pasta with marinara was strange..  Pasta was nice; hand made and had the nice ""al dente"" of fresh but the sauce was odd..  More like a tomato cream sauce than a true marinara. ""Chef's Liberty"" I guess but not a good one.  Dessert was Ricotta Lollipops where were interesting but not overly tasty.  Wine list is long and expensive so be forewarned.  All in all Sinatra was not what I'd hoped for a special day like an anniversary.  Service was lacking; food middle-of-the-road and severely over priced; and, well, that ""No Problem Table"" is going to stick in my mind for a long time.  Restaurants are build on many things.

We weren't worried, quality takes time, but he was and told us he asked the chef to hurry up.  Big mistake, because the $46 lobster risotto we love so much came to us way undercooked.

It is located in a little corner of the Encore, away from the madness of the Casino floor. You definitely want to dress nice (don't even think about Jeans guys!), but they do not require a jacket. 

The interior has a sort of Mad Men 50's feel with many modern touches, especially in the ceiling and chandelier fixtures. The napkins are so nice you almost feel bad wiping your hands on them. The staff is probably the most professional service staff I have ever been serviced by. This was not just a unique trait of Sinatra, but of the entire Wynn and Encore hotel complex.

Sinatra music pumps softly through the speakers, a good mix of his tunes and adds to the atmosphere. The restaurant has a beautiful outdoor area with a fireplace and a garden.

This was a birthday dinner for me and they had little touches waiting for me such a hand-written birthday card, free birthday cookies on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate.

Don't worry, the waiters won't come out wearing sombreros singing happy birthday or anything.

The restauraunt offered a 3 course prix fixe menu from 5:30-6:30 that we took advantage of, the value was fantastic compared to the standard menu prices ($40-50 entrees are the norm). Chef Theo Schoenegger makes amazingly delicious dishes. I don't know where the kitchen finds their mushrooms, but the mushroom risotto was spectacular, as was the chicken marsala. 

The deserts of Tiramasu and Gelato were really really good. The chocolate gelato was one of the most delicious examples of chocolate I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.

I had agnolotti (ricotta filled pasta) with spinach sauce which was lovely. But the real star of the show was my husband's tagliata (rib-eye). It was the best steak of the week (and we had many steaks at many steak places). My dinner was really good, but his was amazing.

First of all, the ambiance is set with the lighting and the music. In the background you constantly here the sounds of Frank Sinatra and many of his greatest hits dancing in your ear. The lighting is very romantic and intimate. The noise level was moderate but I really didn't mind.

You have several people waiting on your table to make sure that your every request is satisfied. I had a glass of Prosecco that night but if you're unsure of what to have with your meal, there is a Somalia on hand to assist you with any of your wine selections. I was quite impressed to see how many waiters were attentive to our table in the event that we needed something.

That night, I settled on an appetizer as my main course. I ordered the blue crab salad over tomato, cucumber and croutons. The amount of blue crab that they placed on the salad was amazing! The crab was light and sweet but not overpowered by the dressing. I also had a veal, beef and pork meatball with fried pancetta. Meatball was so moist and and cooked to perfection. A basket of various bread was also brought to our table. The assortment of bread varied from a rosemary herb bread sticks and a crusted Parmesan. They were paired with your choice of whipped butter or squash and black bean spread. 

Overall, I was highly impressed and will definitely be back. As with any restaurant of this quality, they spared no expense to make sure the ingredients and the service are of the upmost quality. Yes very pricey but worth it!",W1LVSItW5rgufXN3HwmPBg,3,3,5,7NKeKG2JZrxq6wjYZ0clMw

We went last night. They had a nice table for us for two right by the window. Nice. Waiter was friendly and answered any and all questions. 
The starter salads were amazing. I had a hearts of romaine salad with gorgonzola, walnuts and grapes. The dressing of olive oil and vinegar was perfect, not too strong and not too light. One of the better salads I've had.
Since I've been eating a lot of cow in Vegas I decided on something different here. I had the Lobster Risotto. It was very very good. Normally risotto is topped off with a few bits of lobster (if it's Lobster Risotto obviously). Not here. I had a full half of a lobster with both claws on the risotto. Mixed into the lemony, creamy, peppery risotto with peas it was divine. Add in a nice white wine (a chardonnay if you must know) and it was a stellar meal.
I was a bit surprised, honestly, because based on the other reviews I thought it might just be another overpriced Vegas restaurant. From my experience though, and I have had more than a few world class meals, this is an excellent dining experience that should satisfy the pickiest of diners. 
Apparently Steve Wynn was buddies with Old Blue Eyes, hence the name of the place. That's a nice tribute and it makes your dining that much more enjoyable if you're a Frank fan (which frankly I'm not but can appreciate the tunes). Enjoy. Oh, one last thing - take out that second mortgage before coming here, it will come in handy. That is also true for most other restaurants in popular places in Vegas though, so no direct criticism here - it would be nice if restaurants lowered prices somewhat to meet the bleakness of the economy but most must still be getting the prices they're asking for, so pony up or go to In-N-Out instead.",XZ7gWj4cIbFJOhG03lYY7w,1,0,5,j4BusOvMsErvendFWJ1xlQ

The ambiance is fantastic, with actual Sinatra memorabilia, up to par with the high cost, but the Veal Parmesan tasted like it was from late night diner, smothered in a bland tomato sauce. Our party of 7 received their meals all at different times, and way past an acceptable timeframe.
 The risotto was drowned in butter and cream, a cheap and easy way to make anything taste better. I could go on, every aspect, with the exception of a wonderful Somelier, was extremely substandard. When the over $1K bill came, (that's only 2 bottles of wine) and our dis-satisfaction was communicated with the manager, he offered to remove the automatic 18% tip.

We had a bit of a bad experience with the service here. We made a reservation at 8:00 pm on a Saturday. We checked in right at 8:00 pm, and were informed our table was going to be a few minutes. So, we sat down and had a drink while we were waiting. However, 45 minutes went by, and we still weren't seated. No one had come over to talk to us yet or update us on our table. The manager came over and let us know he would take care of our drinks, but we still weren't seated for another 15 minutes. I get it, Saturday in Vegas is busy. Some hiccups are understandable. But, this was totally crazy! It was nice of the manager to take care of our drinks, but there were no apologies or anything. The manager also made sure to have some appetizers ready for us right when we sat down. It was a nice touch and made up for it, but I feel like the manager should have come over to talk to us more and keep us updated. 

Anyways. On to the meal. The appetizers were pretty dang awesome. We had the meatballs and polenta fries and the antipasto plate with mozzarella, olives, prosciutto and roasted peppers. The mozzarella was fresh and creamy. The meatballs were really good too. For my main I had the pennette, which had an italian sausage ragu. It was a really good dish, but not amazing or unique.

Just seems like a trollish thing to do, and generally I'd only go one star for a personal offense directed at me or somebody in my party.  Thus, I'll go two stars - and the second star is only because it's in the Encore, an otherwise absolutely excellent experience from service to gaming to design to the thoughtful Wynn touch (and XS). 

This is notable: absolutely the worst food I've had at a 'nice' restaurant. I'm sorry, Steve Wynn, I personally am because I almost feel like I'm slighting you by short-starring your friend Ol' Blue Eyes. Maybe I should have known naming it after a dead celeb would be a dead giveaway of its shitiness. 

Let me stop for a second and say something positive: I really did enjoy the decor - a large portrait of Frank adorns two walls in a somehow not overbearing way; the use of color is prominent & sophisticated, and the patio + open-facing sidewall was very appealing, and lent an air of openness to the space. Fun setup, and competent staff, if not wholly memorable. And kudos for setting the bar tv on an endless reel of Frank movies. And of course the soundtrack (all Frank) is amazing. But the food. . . 

I had the lamb ossobucco as recommended by the server - ""my personal favorite.""  The lamb literally was so rich, crossing my lips with an almost gamey flavor. The accompanying risotto was layered in salt.  Not just that it ""was salty,"" I'm telling you I needed water for about two hours straight after he meal. Had their shrimp appetizer which tasted like a shrimp cocktail, only deconstructed - boring, but at least not bad. Had their meatballs  - which were fine, in that  they tasted like costco meatballs, which I actually like (dark secret) but when you're paying $25 for an appetizer of four meatballs, please prepare something special. 

Lastly, tried the lasagna - inedible. Kid you not. Wasn't even good enough to choke down. How do you mess up Lasagna at a place named after this legend. Again - the d√©cor was great, the service was fun but what a horrible FOOD experience. Wow.

Fun stuff though and it was expensed so like I say - a bad experience makes a good story. And because of Steve Wynn & the milieu at the Encore, I refuse to give it the one star it truly deserves.",riETmgv8NnaNfTWhXc-XDA,2,1,2,cVGKZUGVQWfOvGlStiT6Nw

Overrated, the food, not the namesake!

Please don't get that twisted. My co-worker booked this reservation based on her daughters recommendation. Note to self - don't listen to her again!

Easiest way to put it, it wasn't bad Italian, but I've had exponentially better. I was disappointed by the lack of flavor in the dishes for such a high end restaurant, and prices that match said style.

We'd been looking at Yelp all day during the tradeshow, in excitement of our upcoming dinner here. I absolutely loved the memorabilia used as decor. I think I was born in the wrong decade ;)

We had to wait to be seated until all of us arrived, then we were whisked into the dining area -- where for high end, they stack people on top of people. It was very dim lit, so much the table behind us was using their iPhone flashlights s to look at the menu and they had to be in their 40s, not even that old!

We were all hungry, since we made an 8PM reservation. Luckily they set down two large portions of different breads, bread sticks, and some crispy cheese things for us all to share. Oh and duh, they offered butter to spread, as well as hummus too. We devoured both bowls of options!

For starters, we knew we wanted to share lasagna as an appetizer and also try something else to share with our large group. However, after ordering our server came back and told us they only had one left -- 3 had been ordered in our group. It ended up going to one of my co-workers and I was left to re-order (rude)!

Instead, she brought out a Pennette -- Italian sausage rag√π, bell peppers,
onions, tomato, fresh basil. to share. We also ordered 2 orders of the Polpettine -- housemade meatballs, polenta fries. The sausage in the Pennette had lots of flavor, the sauce and the other stuff was nothing to even write about, bland for the most part. Some raved about the meatballs, but again I didn't think they were that great and didn't have any robust flavor to them.

We did order a bottle of Chianti and the Somm came over and assisted in doing so. She was polite and served the table the first bottle. She also came back shortly after and brought us a second bottle. I'm not a huge Chianti fan, but after it aerated it tasted better. Again, I'm a simpleton when it comes to wine, not fancy or boughie at all.

Since I had to change my order, I went with the Veal Parmigiana* -- thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce. I also asked for a side of Spaghetti, which was easily accommodated, but they don't put it on the menu. It was good, but I'm still not sure how I feel about eating 'veal'. I'd prefer chicken, bu they don't offer that. They did have a special that night with truffles, but I thought I better not order a $115 appetizer or $195 entree on the company tab. My veal was HUGE and it tasted good, but nothing amazing. Again, the pomodoro sauce left something to be desired.

I know others enjoyed their food, but I don't think anyone was raving about their entrees. 

Our server was great, as you'd expect from a higher end restaurant. She was attentive and also detail oriented. She felt bad about the lasagna and tried her best to make it work for our group.

We didn't order dessert because everyone was pretty stuffed at this point and nothing seemed to peek our interest.

Overall, it was a lackluster dinner for Vegas. The namesake draws you in, but the execution is lacking severely. If you've had good Italian food, then you'd know they are not on par here.

Our waiter was his team excellent; very nice and very attentive. He was also incredibly accommodating; I couldn't decide between the halibut because I loved the presentation with gnocchi and mushrooms, or the scallops because I prefer scallops to halibut , so he let me do the scallops with the halibut presentation!

As I was eating I was thinking ""this is the best Italian food I've had in Vegas."" Towards the end i realized it was actually on the list of best anywhere. First and foremost I have to compliment Roger, our waiter. This guy was present, engaged and overall a complete professional. He was great with recommendations and pacing out the meal. They take care of their guests here and I just felt good with the whole transaction, even though it is pricey, there is serious value. For example, the bread they bring, if you told me it was baked in a Brooklyn bakery that morning, it would be completely believable. Or another example the silverware was actual silver. The glass they pour your water in sat well in your hand. The little things, the details, were all there.  I started with the vegan Caesar salad, with lemon and capers instead of anchovies. It was amazing, clearly every rib of romaine was hand selected for crispness and quality. The Meatballs with Polenta Fries app was mouth watering and delicious. Amazing and worth the trip just for that app. Had a strong Chicken Marsala over gnocchi for entree and desert was the soothing Panna Cotta. Bam. The vibe of the restaurant is early 60's mod with warm pastels and floor to ceiling photos of Ole Blue Eyes. Really interesting decor, they have one of Frank's Academy Awards next to the hostess station, along with a Grammy and an Emmy. If they can get a Tony it will be an EGOT. So yeah...

All weekend I looked forward to it and when I called to make reservations the operator was very patient and help me pick a good restaurant. Italian, mid-ranged prices, named after one of the best singer's ever. Yes, thank you, resrevation for two! While the decor was a bit more casual than I would expect for an Italian restaurant, I enjoyed the atmosphere and all the Sinatra memorabilia covering the walls. Now onto the food...

We got both the vegan version of the beet salad (ie sans cheese) and the  heirloom tomato salad. Tomato salad was ok, very delicious ingredients with lots of flavor but the simplicity of this dish was put to shame but the flavor explosion that was the beet salad. Good Lord! You MUST get the beet salad, absolutely delicious, it was so special with the pieces of citrus and what a beautiful presentation! 

The bf is not vegan but he said his vegetarian ravioli with asparagus creme melted in his mouth. I imagine they must make it on-site. Now I had eaten some ""vegan rissotto"" at Sensi at the Bellagio just 2 days before and it was sadly one of the worst meals I have ever had. Severely undercooked and bland bland bland! The mushroom risotto at Sinatra however, was bursting with flavor, creamy, and chock full of exotic mushrooms in every single bite. I like to savor my food and save the best for last but it soon became clear that this risotto had plenty of yummy mushrooms to go around. Literally several per bite. I Seriously, they do not skimp! 

They also had homemade fruit sorbets that were like a punch of tart, vibrant flavor in every bite. SOOO amazing! 

Also, the service was impeccable and so attentive. When a (for lack of better term) busboy saw me stand up and turn towards the right (the entrance was to the left), he stopped what he was doing and walked over to the door that leads out to the hallway with the restrooms, and waited for me to walk over and opened the door for me. One of the best meals and best dining experiences I've ever had.

     Sinatra re-modeled in 2013, and I didn't get to try it last time I was here in Vegas, which I'm in Vegas so frequent, but it's impossible to try all the restaurants at 1 trip. 7 days in Vegas for CES 2014 did it for me. 

     Sinatra is a beautiful restaurant, dedicated to Frank Sinatra as the name said it. The music was nice, the place is elegant, classic, and intimate. 

     We had our team dinner here, 12 of us, everyone was hungry and we ordered just about everything on the menu.

- Caprese mozzarella di bufala, heirloom tomatoes, red onion, basil - classic and good.

- Prosciutto - Parma prosciutto, caramelized Bartlett pears, Parmigiana Reggiano - nice presentation.

- Polpettine housemade meatballs, polenta fries - this was good.

- Insalatina dell' Imperatore n""Caesar Salad"" anchovy, Parmesan crisp - such a smal portion, and I don't even like big portion, but this was meh.

- Lasagna Bolognese - fresh pasta layered with veal, pork and beef rag√∫ - this was tasty.

- Risotto with lobster - this was quite nice and perfectly creamy. 

- Veal Parmigiana thinly pounded veal chop, melted mozzarella, pomodoro sauce - this was an impressive side, gigantic, but it wasn't that tasty as I was hoping for. 

- The Rib Eye - we ordered medium rare, it was medium. The second order came out was over cooked again, disappointed. 

      The wine list was dominantly Italian, very reasonable, good selection of Chianti, Barolo, Barbaresco, and Super Tuscan. Our sommelier did an amazing job to get us our wines the Nebbiolo and Barbaresco. 

       Our server was so busy with other table that we had to flag him down a few times. I understand that it was CES 2014, but still as a caliber of this restaurant, we expect a higher par.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,12,5,3,i_h6Z6oEjcJHjva0Ts9cqw

Didn't know what to expect.

Firstly, the entire staff was amazing. We had a person in our party with food allergies and they were practically on bended knee to ensure every need was cared for, not simply bubble wrapping them, but elevating the dining (read good eats) experience was more than equivalent to their regular fare.

Secondly, the food was amazingly good, given that it is the West Coast. Heck it was the best bread I have had on West of Brooklyn, NY. And that is saying a lot.

I went into Sinatra and took a seat at the bar. The bartender Peter is a true master.  The bar was immaculate, but so was his technique. He masterfully measured and perfectly mixed nearly a hundred drinks in front of me, never dropping even a grain of salt from a rim. His workspace and technique were immaculate. 

I enjoyed 3 Smashes, a delicious concoction where the main players are Gentleman Jack and muddled black berries. I can see why this cocktali has won mention from the James Beard Foundation, and numerous references in Food & Wine Magazine.

To start off the meal I had the Prosciutto & Pear appetizer, which was flawless and delicious, nothing new here, but fantastically delicious. For dinner I had the Pennette, a sausage Ragu with a smart smack of fresh and vibrant herbs added for kick.  THIS MIGHT BE THE PASTA I HAVE EVER TASTED.

As I arrived at my dining table, there was a cute little card waiting for me on the table. I opened it up and it was a HAND-WRITTEN birthday card. I thought it was very sweet that the restaurant went out of their way to hand-write a birthday card for me...quite a memorable characteristic indeed. 

As for the food...I could not believe that this restaurant has an entire vegan menu. I am not vegan, but am lactose intolerant and they were able to modify all dishes to meet my dietary needs. And all of the food spectacular! 

For my starter, I ordered the beef carpaccio served with salsa verde, wild arugula, shaved parmigiano, and croutons. Excellent combination.

For my main course, I had the agnolotti filled with butternut squash and served with sage, parmesan, and brown butter. They made this dish completely dairy-free for me. I have seen a similar dish at several other restaurants, however I can never order it due to its high dairy content. I must say I was impressed with these accommodations. 

For dessert, I ordered  the bomba al cioccolato made with Valrhona chocolate cake, raspberries and passion fruit sorbet. DAIRY FREE. This is the best vegan dessert I have ever  tasted in my life. It did not taste vegan at all...actually tasted quite normal :) The combination of the cake the with sorbet went perfectly together.

The ambiance is elegant and lovely. There are photos of Frank Sinatra all around with charming Sinatra music playing in the background. They also gifted me and my entire party with Holiday Frank Sinitra CDs!! Can you believe that? We all left with Sinatra CDs! If thats not going over the top...then I don't know what is. The bathrooms are also beautiful. The bathrooms are technically the Encore hotel bathrooms, but regardless they have HAIRSPRAY and hand lotion in BOTH the men's and women's powder rooms. And the hand lotion smells amazing!

Finally, I must comment on the service as it was outstanding. We dined as a party of 6 and asked our server to provide each of us with individual itemized receipts (for reimbursement purposes). The server did not complain or have any problems with our request. In fact, he remembered each of our items and was happy to fulfill our request.

I don't recall what it was called but they loved it.

I decided to go with the Chicken which was covered in wild mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce over gnocchi. It was DELICIOUS - the gnocchi was the best I ever ate - light tiny little clouds that I couldnt stop eating. The sauce was perfect and the chicken as well. 

My co diners had the salmon which was served over vegetables and the pork saltimbocca which was served with a creamy, cheesy spinach. Both said they were delicious.

We passed on dessert as we were too full. Service was excellent and the atmosphere dimly lit and quiet. Perfect for client entertaining or a romantic evening.",8B188riM26vd9B2uGqV3cg,1,0,5,zeOviKAU-c6TZm67auv8Og

Asked for still water and promptly had the customary San Pellegrino brought to the table.  Greeted by our server after about 15 minutes.  Ordered a bottle of wine and she promptly disappeared.  Sommelier brought us the wine...and we waited further.  Finally I flagged her down again and asked for bread and an appetizer to share.  Not impressed with the caprese.  As we waited for our server to return we noted the you couldn't hear ANY of the Frank Sinatra music that was playing in the background.  Extremely loud and unpleasant atmosphere.  The filets were well done but nothing special and the sides were meager.  I was tired of steak for the week so I ordered the penne pasta with sausage ragu.  OK, but not anything special.  At every course I had to yell to our server to get her to stop at our table.  Frankly we were so disappointed that we just wanted to leave.  I can see where this place could be great but not on this night and not with this server.
There are many first class restaurants in the Vegas area.  Capital Grill and Del Frisco's, to name two, were head and shoulders above this place.  Too bad we hit it on an off night.",eh6pC8o7rCYT94oaGN-_eQ,0,0,3,ejp-M1EsZmDLEocLS173hg

You need to call ahead and find out if they carry the wine on their menu.  If the do carry the wine, don't bring it.  Second, Mr Snooty Wynn will only allow you to bring two bottles of wine in no matter the size of your party.  The managers would only say ""This is Mr Wynns rule.""

I live in River North in Chicago, and we dine out often at world class establishments, so I am not basing this review on a unfair comparison..     

My group all agreed that for the price paid the food was bland and uninspired basic Italian American fair..  I mean $38.00 for pasta with sauce and sausage...   come on man..
The meatball appetizer .. 4 small meatballs for 20+ dollars  .. wow.    $70.00 for wine that VIVINO rated a 3.2 out of 5..  shame...   Martini's are the smallest on the strip...
Frank is crying...
  I had the veal parm..  It was ok, but Perieo's blows this one on quality, taste, and price.   I understand you are paying for the circus, but the owners know that, and have let the quality slip, and still charging outrageous prices for what you receive..  

Go if you want a quality bread basket, and listen to Frank

5913747,2015-09-28,0,e0JOkQYz_cnz91k6X55PLw,"Sinatra has been on my radar for quite a while and it definately did not dissappoint. We arrived at 6:00 pm and were seated quickly. The restaurant is large but intimate and very classy. With the large picture of Frank and his music playing softly in the backround you know your in his restaurant. 

After being seated it did take quite a while for anyone to acknowledge us. No menus, no drink orders and no water service. Eventually someone in a suit (Sommellier?) came by to take our drink and wine orders. The menus and water service followed shortly after. The menu is classic italian; Antipasto, caprese, pastas, osso bucco, veal parm, etc. Our waiter was pretty quiet. The service was fine but nothing extraordinary or over the top which I would expect here. 

The veal parm came highly recommended so I went with that. We also ordered a antipasto for the table and the panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, tomato and cucumber). Both appetizers were very good. The prosciutto and fresh buffalo mozzarella in the antipasto were excellent. The entrees arrived and the veal parm took up the entire plate, it was huge. It was covered in cheese and had the perfect amount of sauce. They also leave it on the bone which is a nice presentation. The veal was so tender and just melted in your mouth. 

For dessert we had the gelato and the tiramisu. If you order gelato you get to choose 3 different flavors. We had Coconut, Hazelnut and Chocolate.The tiramisu was definately a better choice. The gelato was ok but served almost melted. 

Overall an excellent dinner and dining experience.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,2,4,3rr8nWiNB7Sclq_Mb_dsxw

We've dined here many many times.  Before we moved to Vegas, we would fly in to dine here on special occasions.  

tart with one of their signature drinks...so original and refreshing.  

Hubby will usually have the Veal Parmesan or the Pennette.  Both authentic and delicious.  The Veal is massive and super tender.

I'm a fish girl so it's usually the scallops or branzino.  Both incredible.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu too.  The couscous with ratatatouille is out of this world.

The service here is impeccable. We always enjoy listening to how they describe the specials.  These professionals could make anything sound incredible. Always attentive and friendly.  

For dessert, the lemon cheesecake with raspberry sorbet is my favorite and is as beautiful as it is delicious.  Make sure to ask about the crostata of the day.  They are always fresh and perfect.

So to start, this is an excellent place for a fancy-pants meal and it's sure to satisfy any vegan along with their carnivorous counterparts.  If you're vegan be sure to request the vegetarian menu, there are a plethora of options.  And to start, our waitress brought over a bread basket with real butter (for the bf) and vegan butter (for me) and she even let me know which breads I could eat - hooray because I always have to eat bread without butter at restaurants.  Next came my appetizer, the heirloom tomato soup...it was creamy (I think with cashews), flavored well, and down-right delectable!  But the winner of the evening was the entree, the Agnolotti.  It's basically little pockets filled with vegan ricotta and herbs topped with asparagus sauce, yes, asparagus sauce!!!  I'd never had asparagus sauce in my life until Sinatra, and let me tell you, I'm a fan.

But we were a party of 10, and all agreed the food was not consistently good and largely mediocre. My appetizer was good, and served hot, but my desert came out warm on the edges and cold and undercooked in the middle. 

Worse, the service was terrible. Dinner took 3:15 minutes and not because we were slow with ordering. Our waiter was not on top of our table and also wasn't the least bit helpful with recommendations. For example, half the group did not realize the sides were not family style, and he didn't advise. Consequently when the entrees arrived multiple people were sitting there with just meat. Given it was well over 90 minutes since we arrived, no one was willing to order them at that point.

The Osso Bucco is a must here. The meat just falls off the bone and the marrow is pure goodness. My guy committed a mortal sin in my book here. He ordered his lamb well-done (horror or horrors). I begged him not to, but he insisted. Well, you know the place is good if they were able to prepare well-done lamb and still make it moist and juicy. I was quite impressed.

At the end of the meal, they mistakenly delivered us a birthday dessert with a candle in it and walked away too quickly for me to argue with them. Without thinking I blew out the candle, but then I guess the waiter realized his mistake and came back to retrieve the dessert. He apologized and walked away with it. I would think they would just leave it with us, since they certainly couldn't serve a cake that I'd already breathed on to someone else... Oh well, lol.

Definitely worth a trip.  I'll be back for the meatballs next time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,3,4,SJt1AaNe964WIufkhytMVg

To be honest, we stuck out a little, considering we aren't well off like many others that were dining there that evening. We were among wealthy businessmen and their wives.
None the less, we weren't there for that.  
We were celebrating the beginning of our lives together. We had a beautiful ceramony earlier that day, and we were ready to splurge. 
I ordered my favorite wine, a crisp pino griegio, and my handsome husband ordered a beer. (Definitely more his style). 
I ordered lobster ravioli(my favorite) and my husband  ordered paglioteli pasta with a cream sauce. Both were so yummy. The service was absolutely amazing. 
At the end of our meal, our waitor brought us chocolates and caramels with ""congratulations""  written on the plate out of chocolate syrup. We were so touched.
