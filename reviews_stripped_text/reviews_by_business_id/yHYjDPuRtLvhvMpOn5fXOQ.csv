11656,2010-12-29,1,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"Not sure if this is a fair review since I didn't really eat a full meal.  We did take-out for a light midnight snack.  I order the sashimi dinner.  You have the option of ordering 7 or 14 pieces of sashimi (it's $25 for the 14 pieces).  I thought the price was fair.  It came with miso soup and rice.  I thought the fish was pretty fresh, for Vegas at least.  I rather have this than AYCE here in Vegas.

My boyfriend ordered just philly rolls, and he really like them.  He compared it to the philly rolls from an AYCE place we went to the following day, and prefers this one a lot more.  It's smaller in size, which I think sushi should be (bite size) and much fresher in quality.

I've been to this place before when it first opened, but I don't really remember much of it.  Hope to give it another try later on.",sEx1Ua3yNjxBdJ_vJ9amfA,2,0,3,ltx9j07ZGp4RB9UiW5fWTA

48938,2014-11-29,4,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"First time at Naked Fish's... Very disappointed. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated which is fine but once we were seated, the waitress gave us no time to get settled in and came over to rush our order. 

She did not offer a greeting, recommendations or even a smile. She had the personality of the salmon sashimi, which may possibly have been the worst we ever had. It was slimy and fishy and at $12 per order, not even close to being worth it. 

I am very disappointed with the yelp community for praising this pretentious and unfriendly restaurant. We spent $70 on a meal and enjoyed nothing from the menu nor the experience. We will never go back. 

Actually, the Cali roll, although very small, was tasty. Also, the other waitress who had to help us because our waitress disappeared during our dinner and the beverage runner who helped us more than our sashimi waitress, were very pleasant and friendly and made me wish we could have tipped them instead.

We have tried many sushi places in town and for those of you looking to enjoy the whole experience of dining out for a quality meal that you are paying for, please avoid this spot. Go instead to Soho (west side) or Miko's Izakaya (east side). They truly raise the bar.

190010,2012-12-07,0,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"After our favorite sushi restaurant, which we followed our favorite sushi chefs to, shut down due to a partner dispute, we are searching out a new favorite. Living up in Summerlin, we wanted something really close to home. 5 minutes away, with pretty good reviews, was Naked Fish. We decided to give it a shot.

It's in a typical strip mall location. Walking in, the restaurant is small, but very warm and inviting. It was also pretty danged quiet. We were greeted immediately and we asked to sit at the sushi bar. 

My favorite part of a sushi restaurant is the bar. Naked Fish's bar seats 4 kinda comfortably, 6 completely uncomfortably, and the sushi bar intrudes on the dining area. We had to pull in for other customers to get to their table. Minus a star. Immediately. The dining area is small, but pleasant. 

The staff was attentive and kind. Ray, our sushi chef was friendly. 

We were given cucumber salad with this sticky sweet dressing and sesame seeds. Yuck. We were not given hot towels to wipe our hands with, something we've always appreciated. We were also not given edamame, something we always get for free at nearly every sushi bar. The server came and took our drink order, and we did notice they had a very impressive beer and sake menu, at decent prices. Alas, this dumb cold had me ordering hot tea. 

We also ordered edamame, which cost $5. While the order was large, it  overcooked and soggy. Minus another star. 

We ordered tuna, yellowtail and salmon sushi. The fish was a nice size, fresh and tasty. Earn a star. 

The rolls all left us uninspired. We searched the menu for quite a while looking for something that appealed to both of us. We finally settled on the GR3. The fish was fresh, but it was boring and bland. For our second roll, we asked the chef for something complex and spicy. He recommended the Oh My Gosh. We ordered it, without cream cheese (on a bagel? Yum! On fish? No.) The fish was fresh. The sliced serrano chili was hot. And besides that? Boring and bland. Minus a star. 

We wanted to love it because of the location. We didn't. We won't be back.",SnJtzOlG9cbjmfI27nJjiw,0,0,2,yTfyFwupIgCVXrPFn91IjQ
208517,2014-03-07,0,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"One of the places that I frequent most often, for a number of reasons: consistently good food, welcoming staff, open late.

The happy hour menu is my best friend, because I go late (past 10pm). There is also a happy hour earlier in the evening, but I never make that one. I love to order a variety of things at one time, and some of my favorite rolls drop to $3-7 during happy hour. This makes it affordable to eat here often. Plus $1 glass of refillable soda, $3 wine. It's almost unbelievable.

The food itself is greatly reliable. The Spicy Chicken appetizer is my favorite (I pay $1 to ""upgrade"" to white meat). My order always consists of one Naked Girls Roll. I love that I can order something tonight and it will taste the same as it did 6 months ago. There is a continuity between the chefs that allows this place to be consistent time and time again.

I always request Emii as my server. She is extremely polite and attentive and works the late evening shift, which coincides with when I'm usually craving sushi. 

I normally call a couple hours prior, to request a reserved booth by the window. It is always ready when I get there, even at midnight. It's a 20 second call that eliminates the wait time.

She started us out with some sashimi platters, one of which was albacore with a citrus sauce that melted in your mouth like butter! The others were equally as excellent, such as yellow tail in a ponzu sauce topped with green onions and jalapenos. She followed up with some awesome rolls, 3 of which I can't get out of my mind... Sun Devil, Sunset and Roppongi! One of our party was allergic to salmon and Wanda took special care to point out which rolls she should avoid. We ended our feast with mango and green tea Mochi, and it appeared to be homemade... (not the Mochi you can get in the grocery). Interior is pleasant... with a relaxed atmosphere.

367216,2010-08-04,0,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"I try to find new go to sushi places in town and I'm almost getting to a point where I need to stop doing it since it's always a miss and this was no exception.  

I'm certain that many of the reviewers raving about sushi at Naked fish has very limited or NO experience of real sushi, i.e. in Japan.

I went during lunch time, and their menu was somewhat unfocused  There are a lot of izakaya type items as well as sushi items, and although there were a few lunch specials I was interested in, I went for the sushi at the counter.  After all, this IS supposed to be a sushi place.

It seemed that the wait staff were all Japanese, and I was surprised to find out that the sushi chefs were not.  This is unequivocally a bad sign.  I order a couple of rolls and a few nigiris directly to the sushi chef.

My goodness, I must have waited 15 minutes until anything came out.  I even asked the chef if he remembered what I ordered and he said yes, but that he was busy.  

Did he look busy?  Well yes, in a way, but he was pretty slow and inefficient, and although he was the younger of the 2 chefs, but the other was no faster.  Besides, out of 8 or so seats on the counter, there are only 3 people.  

Really, if someone orders a sushi at the counter, you serve them immediately.  This is fundamental.  How do I know this?  I'm Japanese, have eaten in many of the best sushi restaurants in Japan including many Michelin starred sushi places in Tokyo.  I really shouldn't be comparing Kyubei or Sukiyabashi Jiro with a place in Vegas and I'm not, but ""sushi chef"" not understanding these fundamental rules of sushi?  That's why I said it's a bad sign when a sushi chef is not Japanese.  They just don't get it, he was certainly no exception.  When someone at the counter is order sushi, you go right at it.  It's only 4 total orders for 2 people, how long does that take?  well it took him 20 minutes, quite irritating.  

So how was the sushi?  Mediocre at best.  Too hard of a grip, too little air in the rice, sushi rice was not to my liking.  fish was decent, nothing spectacular as people say.  But after 20 minutes of waiting for 4 pieces of sushi, it's a lost cause at that point.  

All in all, I was quite disappointed. I'm going back to my usual place.  Where is that?  I'm not telling any random people, but if people really like the sushi here and is serious about wanting to taste/learn sushi, I think they need to start listening to their own palate and go to Japan and have some real sushi so that you have something to compare to so that they can have a ""standard"" sushi in their mind.  This was another nanchatte sushi.",MS5RdlNCQtpd4k3N05pZLQ,1,0,1,4LxVimDCOBhVh51J1tubRg

The last two times I went here which includes today I had to ask for drinks which bugs me because it's not that big of a spot. Service has been slow lately for reasons I can't explain. Today started with a dirty miso spoon, not a huge deal but when added to the rest of night was kind of the cherry on top for me...nigiri prices/ pieces changed, sooo normally nigiri albacore would be 2.5 for a TWO piece nigiri but I guess someone had the bright idea to change it to ONE piece. Lol seriously a small ass piece of sushi for 2.5 and everyone else is charging that for a two piece? Seems like they are getting greed, I don't sea a reason to pay over 2.5 for a literal ""bite"" of sushi. Anyway! Then we wanted some yellow tail ""one piece nigiri"" lol which was also 2.5. When the waitress informed us they had yellowtail belly for the same price, so we took it. When my party received the bill the yellowtail belly wasn't 2.5 but 3.0! While this isn't a major problem being its only 50 cents extra per piece...the point is that the waitress informed us it was the same price when it clearly wasn't.

669115,2011-01-08,2,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"Naked Fish has the BEST quality sushi!

Now before I go on and give my review of this restaurant, let me tell you that I've been to a lot of expensive restaurants.. where having good quality fish is a must. I've been to Yellowtail at the Bellagio, I've been to Nobu at the Hard Rock, and I've even been to Morimoto's in New York. After spending hundreds of dollars at all these other restaurants, I must say.. I would have rather gone to Naked Fish for sushi.\

When:
The first time I came here, I was with my boyfriend and his brother (who was visiting Las Vegas from Orlando). My boyfriend plays poker for a living, and this restaurant came up in conversation many times when he would be playing.. so we just had to give this place a try. We came here on a Sunday night around 10pm.

Where: 
This place is a little far from the strip and from where I live (Henderson); however, it's well worth the drive. When walking in; the restaurant  was smaller than what I was imagining. The place was a little busy, and we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated. We were seated in one of the booths near the windows.. from our table you could see the entire strip. The view was beautiful.

Who:
Service here is just okay in my opinion. It may have been the fact that we were all super hungry, but it seemed as though it took FOREVER to get our food. However, the 2nd time I've been here.. the wait wasn't that long. There were also times when we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. 

What:
Yuzu Salmon (Appetizer): This is definitely a MUST whenever I go here. The salmon is soooo tender and just melts in your mouth; and the flavor compliments the fish just sooooo well. I urge anyone to give this a try.. I give you my word that you will not be disappointed.

Yellowtail, Albacore, & Red Snapper Nigiri: I just LOVE these.. they are all so fresh and tender.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these.

Spicy Tuna Roll: We ordered this because they serve it on the Happy Hour menu.. this is definitely the best spicy tuna I've had. The texture of the spicy tuna is just right, and it's not TOO spicy. 

Price:
As I mentioned earlier, the prices for their sushi is only a fraction of what you would pay at a fine dining restaurant. For 3 people, we paid around 70 dollars for everything. Yes, some may consider that expensive given the fact that everything is a la carte and not an AYCE place.. However; the quality of fish is on par with any fine dining sushi place. You will NOT find this quality of fish anywhere that serves AYCE sushi. This place serves high quality fish for just a fraction of the price. Yes, most people would prefer an AYCE place and get the most for their money.. However, I prefer quality over quantity

Why... I would definitely be back.
Naked Fish's quality is top notch.. and I'm also glad they are open late everyday (2am).. it's soooo hard to satisfy my sushi cravings late at night. But now I've found the perfect place. Anytime I want sushi, this is my go to place.",qjrcCHNOhdz26BXhFB1NiQ,2,0,5,mbrUFoe53oG3BDUKRWtSEw

I have been on and off the sushi train for the past year or so, mostly unimpressed with local places. However, Naked Fish has me booking a one way train to Wasabiville because this is the best sushi I have had in Vegas in a really long time.

712559,2010-06-28,0,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"Operating in the sushi market in the town of Las Vegas is tough. ""I've eaten sushi all over the nation and this is the best""...if I had a dime for every person that said that, well you can do the math. Funny when you see the lady sitting at a cheap probably 3 month life span sushi restaurant eating frozen tuna raving about the freshness and quality. Here is the low down because your hearing from someone that really knows: 
FISH COMES IN ALL TIERS AND PRICES FROM THE SUPER CHEAP TO TOP QUALITY (Remember you are what you eat) 
1. All the purveyors nationwide will sell frozen tuna if given the chance (all you can eat sushi bars Todai, I Love sushi etc, etc. and cheap poke places) Let me tell you the process: The manufacturers will take old tuna of poor quality that didn't sell at market usually staring to turn rotten and brown. They then fabricate and process using carbon monoxide , smoke and food coloring, hence the bright red color. After this they vacuum seal, freeze and sell to fish purveyors for pennies who then sell to restaurants for just a little more. Then YOU get stoked when you can enjoy all you can eat tuna sushi at a shitty sushi bar that is fluorescent red colored because all you worry about is quantity not quality. 
2. All Hamachi sashimi is farm raised poor quality from Asia. Wild caught Yellowtail or its' cousins will run a market price of $40 - $50 a pound translating to $12- $14 for 2 pieces of sushi. 
3. Salmon mostly farm raised because the wild stuff can cost a restaurant double triple and they figure that they can dress it up enough with ponzu sauce or mayo to the point where no once can tell the difference. Also the farm raised salmon live in very contaminated polluted environments with the water being constantly diluted with antibiotics sometimes (USDA and FDA knows this) with agents that are carcinogenic and/or harmful to human beings. 

Anyway enough on the boring education, ignorance is bliss. Naked Fish is by far the best place in Las Vegas to get sushi off the strip that is unpretentious and with a reasonable price tag considering the quality. Sen of Japan is great but don't want to pay $300 a head for a Nobu's knock off. Service at Naked Fish is great and they take the time to get to know their customers. My only complaint is that I wish they would expand to more traditional Japanese dishes, but given their diverse clientele it is understandable.",t3dxO3Y0MMfdqcaVYfeUPA,5,1,5,Vo8eWqfD7ka7ZLV-V8reZQ

I recommend you try: the Gyozas, any of there tempura,  zero tiger roll ( light with some spice), 911 roll (spicy), futomaki ( big roll with a mix),  spicy tuna ( the best way to make a classic).

We had great service that was incredibly friendly. We started off with the Screaming Orgasm salad (an ahi tuna over some fresh greens and a vinagrette dressing), which is not on the menu. That was great and then we had a bunch of nigiri sushi and rolls. Everything was fresh and excellent but the thing that really got us to rave ""this is REALLY good!"" was the Japanese Lasagna. Wow, we could not get enough of that - very addicting.

My only regret?  My 4 year old daughter (who LOVES sushi rolls) was so tired from the day's events that she ended up sleeping through all of dinner and missed out. My 7 year old son, however, thought the rolls he had were delicious.

Even better, since my son is allergic to cow's milk, they had a mango sorbet. It was a bit pricey for a sorbet but it was actually frozen inside half of a mango skin and was quite plentiful. Turns out that they get the sorbet imported in from Italy already packed into the mango skin. My son was in heaven!

When we are in Vegas again, we are certainly going to be hitting Naked Fish's again!  We are already recommending it to our friends who are visiting Vegas too.",17mIfDdKLcS9X0NBBEWGfw,1,0,4,02WfKdoQBKDbhzOxhHpFIw

I'm still not sure about the decor since there are giant posters of Cirque du Soleil shows framed on the walls all signed by the cast.  I'm not sure if a Cirque employee owns the place or the owner just really loves Cirque.  Nonetheless, Naked Fish is also a good place to spot entertainers looking for a good healthy meal after work.  I've mainly spotted Cirque performers or dancers from Crazy Horse Paris there.  

One more added gem to the place.  If you are lucky enough to get a booth by the window, you get an unobstructed view of the Las Vegas Strip since there is nothing across the street but a big dirt lot.  Really pretty at night when the Strip is all lit up.

Fine by us, our diet cokes were soon delivered. They had an odd taste, like peppermint or something.

Our total was $40 for two drinks and three rolls. The rolls were not worth $12.50, pricey, especially to leave hungry... I'll stick to Hokaido Sushi, it's closer to home, tastier and a better value.

Everything else felt the same as most sushi restaurants that I've been too. Wish the sushi was a little more chilled and not room temperature. Plus the service was poor. I was expecting so much more for what we spent but it was not worth it. I would rather spend the money I spent there at a nice steak house restaurant.,dE06ZauqS1mMdTsnaSxvlA,0,0,2,Ziz_gKPtQHq0zGe2_cpp3w

Naked Fish is an intimate Spring Valley sushi stop worth the trip if you're not in the area.  I like Naked Fish for the fresh variety of interesting seafare, and it's somewhat lower prices.  

The menu is always changing to reflect what is fresh.  This is what separates Naked Fish from many other sushi restaurants.  In addition to the higher quality and fresh variety, the prices aren't as high as you would find at a few other notable sushi places in the valley.  

Here's my order:

Shigoku Oysters -  Two fresh japanese oysters, served with some garlic, scallions, and soy sauce (I believe).  The oysters were a bit more firm than ones you would find from the east coast, but a nice mild flavor.  I thought some of the flavors the oyster was served with came off muddled, I would have rather tasted the oyster au natural.

Rounin Aji -  This Japanese Sea Bass was delicate and delicious.  It had a fuller flavor of the ocean than some other sea bass I've had, and was quite nice.

Sashimi A Combo -  Tuna, Salmon, Hamachi.  Nice presentation, but the sashimi was sliced a bit thick for my preference.  I think thinner cuts would also aid in the presentation.  Regardless, the high quality was evident in each piece.

Spicy Tuna Handroll -  Well balanced with reasonable heat.  A very good handrail.

The rolls on the menu looked good, I would come back and try a few.  They also have some happy hours, check out some of the other great reviews to get info on those.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,4,0,4,Gj0rtQcT0KWd9Z-AQKNbaA

Occasionally I would ask them to look out for a certain type of fish and they occasionally will get it in and remember that it was you who asked for it....

Japanese lasagna came out, MAYBE, room temperature instead of out of the oven hot how it is suppose to be. But honestly, I can't complain because I did enjoy it & all it's almost cold goodness.

Salmon skin roll was 3/5. Not bad but I probably should've gotten something else.

Wanda is the best server ever! She is efficient, friendly, very knowledgeable (take her recommendations seriously - she's always right).
Good quality sushi. It's fresh and done right.
I won't talk much about the rolls, cause if you like sushi, you know what rolls you like and all you need to know is that the fish is very fresh and good quality, so you can't really go wrong. Our favorites are the Ropongi and the Tiger rolls.
Love their sautéed mushrooms appetizer. It's like tasting the forest! (sprinkle it with that a bit of that lemon wedge they give you)
The tempura mushroom appetizer is also great. 
I knocked down one star because unfortunately not all servers are as good as Wanda. 
Also, there seems to be an issue with the order and pace that the food arrives. You could get your roll before you appetizers, or some rolls come to the table and the other diners can sit there for an additional 10-15 minutes before they see any food, watching the lucky ones at the table eat while they wait!
Personally I find the place to be a bit too dark - I like to see my food. it also sometimes feels beyond ""cozy"" and borderline cramped and claustrophobic when it's packed, but I guess it's not their ""fault"" that they are so popular and the great food and late opening hours totally make up for any shortcomings.",x_eztqDB2mvZ5uTP5v3NUA,0,0,4,WyzVf9YELx9zu_xanjFg0Q

Okay, technically friend who was dating a stripper took him and then he took me after. Clearly the first sounds better by a mile.

Naked Fish's is intimate and low-lit with a teeny tiny sushi bar as chefs seemingly squeezed in like sardines (wha-wha). What they lack in size, they gladly deliver with quality fish and good attention to detail. Our server (ask for Wanda) was very knowledgeable and polite, if not stern. You can tell she spoke with confidence the about their menu.

We took her advice and started with the conch--sliced thin then cooked in olive oil and soy sauce (kept thinking about Lord of the Flies--Piggy, ""I have the conch!""). To say nothing of the squid-like texture, it was actually addictive. Definitely eat this with a bowl of rice as it can be a bit salty by itself after a few bites on its own.

Wanda also suggested to peruse through the other specials. Took a dive at kurodai, or black sea bream, which is very close to red snapper in taste. Then the usual suspects like the buttery blue-fin toro (medium tuna belly for $10--yikes), uni (sea urchin--pretty fresh), hokkigai (surf clam--eh), ikura (salmon roe--usually this is salty and this was pleasantly not) and of course hamachi (yellow tail--nice white belly slices). I need to point out that all of the sushi was prepared masterfully, almost too pretty to eat, really. Almost.

Other good stuff; tiger roll (freshwater eel, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and avocado drizzled with a sweet sauce) which was done very well considering this is a pretty tame dish; grilled hamachi collar was my favorite, prepared perfectly; sautéed clam sake butter (sautéed clams and garlic sprouts) had some sandy clams, otherwise quite tasty; and finally for dessert, an original house creation called Pa Pa Pa Parfait (vanilla ice cream whipped with tempura banana, strawberries, chocolate sauce and curiously, pretty sure it was garnished with Frosted Flakes)--a little too decadent but I saw the bottom of the glass anyway.

I love sushi and have hit the local scene pretty hard trying to find a place I can simply be a regular in. This is not an all-you-can eat joint so if you're super hungry, be prepared to cough it up. I will say though: it's worth it.

By the way, this provocatively named restaurant is in an unassuming strip mall, and if you're driving and don't look hard, you'll pass it by.

Just try not to.

Discovered this gem today, thanks to Vicky Q's recent check in and an incurable salmon craving. The HH menu has an awesome deal: 3 rolls and a drink for $21, with the ability to choose two standard rolls and one specialty. 
Chose the ROPPONGI roll, PHILADELPHIA roll, and the HALEY roll, along with a seaweed salad, and iced green tea for my beverage of choice.

Rolls were stunning- fresh fish, good portions, great specialty rolls.
Roppongi roll in particular is an amazing mouthgasm! Flavors are a mashup of spicy and creamy with fresh fish, soft rice, a pop of flavor with green onion, and sauces that are tasty without being overkill. It's a must-have, and I don't throw that term around lightly.
Haley roll was also good- shrimp tempura with avocado and crab, relatively light considering the tempura factor, which I'm not usually a fan of.
Philadelphia roll is about what you'd expect, but who doesn't love the classic American style combo of salmon and cream cheese?

Service was polite and attentive, chair I sat in was very comfortable (two-top between the sushi bar and the booths), portions were so plentiful that I only ate half of what I ordered and took the rest home.

One of the best HH menus I've found, could easily get the pick-three and add on a discounted roll from their specials menu and have a sushi dinner with my guy for under $40 with tip- not bad AT ALL.

Only complaint is that the green tea is made with a powder, which lends a grittiness to the taste/texture that I did not like, but next time I'll just get a Sapporo!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,5,5,Xr8goiyd5RzmHCTC_nyxyw

Date night with another couple found us at my ALL-TIME favorite Las Vegas sushi emporium (is emporium the best word?) We made reservations a few days out because it was the birthday for 2 of us.

NF is located n the West side between Twain and Flamingo on the west side of Durango. It's easy to get in and out of the unassuming strip mall and there's lots of parking. The entrance looks like the proverbial ""hole-in-the-wall"" eatery. It's not well lit, but the overhead sign is easy to see.

The interior is darkish and there are not many seats. However NF is a ""true"" Japanese sushi establishment. The staff is Japanese (not Korean, as found in many places). While this might seem trite, it does go toward the cultural knowledge of preparing and serving true sushi. From there, surprises await :)

The hostesses/servers are sisters with so much amazing personality, I thought they were practicing for a stage show. All three who helped us (in no particular order) were lovely, happy, and accommodating. Nothing but smiles from them.

The fish is the freshest I've encountered ANYWHERE! The variety and range of items is astounding. We even found many unusual Japanese items. We had traditional nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls and cut rolls. We also had Agadashi Tofu, deep fried Barracuda, whole mackerel (which they removed, deep fried, and returned once we had eaten the outer fish ... leaving a deep fried spine and head ... yes, yummy!) So many delicious treats and quite a number of fascinating items to explore.

As a finale ... and because we had 2 birthdays at the table, they brought a complimentary order of Tempura ice cream!!!! This was high-quality ice cream dipped in tempura batter, deep fried, cut into quarters, and each quarter covered with a fruit topping. It was decadent and delicious.

This is the ""go-to"" sushi place IMHO! If you go, enjoy!!!!",fwStqPnr2ks06nwFbZv0zw,0,0,5,-qBExJM57zMglv6q1At4tg

So many good things going on here. I don't know where to begin. I came here with family for the first time over four years ago. Sushi was new to me at the time, but it was still DAMN good! Eventually, since I was still a high school student, I couldn't afford eating sushi so often, so I stopped coming. I completely stopped going to any a la carte sushi restaurants simply because a hungry guy such as myself can't afford it. I came here again after a long time, and I must admit the food is as good as ever. My cousin (a culinary expert) commented that the quality of sushi at a la carte restaurants are usually much better than AYCE restaurants. I definitely have to agree with him on that. However, on the plus side for me, Naked Fish is planning making AYCE available as well as all you can drink!

Customer service is friendly as ever from the day I came. I was waited by someone new this time; although, the SUPER friendly older looking Japanese waitress still works there. I'm always getting fast service and my party is always getting checked on.

All in all, if you can afford the prices, Naked Fish is AWESOME",P0Zd9BjnCgbfzsHiQFdhoA,0,0,4,GiMg-tfOj7y42qlUp1mA4A

He acknowledged he understood in his own neanderthal way but the roll never came. He wouldn't even make eye contact with me.  He comes off with a horrible attitude and shouldn't be in the service industry. I'll never be back and obviously the ratings this restaurant has are over inflated.

For $21 you get three sushi rolls and a beer! You can't beat this at any other sushi spot. Of course they only serve Japanese beers, so they are on the weaker side but still tasty for what they are. Now I'm not a fan of baked rolls, but the Japanese Lasagna Roll is out of bounds! So much flavor and not over cooked. If baked rolls aren't your thing then definitely try the Roppongi Roll. The presentation is damn near artistic and the harmony of flavors are euphoric.

However,I get really disappointed about the services. Their foods are delicious. It's little bit over price but that's okay. 
One day I ordered togo order by the phone,they got double order than I ordered. Once I realized they got double order,I told them I didn't order2,then she said ""oh really?"" And looked at me like, SO??what? 
So I said to them that's okay. After that,she asked me 'do you want other order instead of that then?' 
Uhm.. why don't you ask me to get a refund and I don't take the order whichs I didn't order then. 

Well..that was okay cause I wasn't expecting good services from them because I've been went this place so many times and their service was just okay (even I went so many times and always put 20-25% of tip their service was so-so)

However,I went this place about few days ago for togo order. And I was really disappointed! ! The girl who looks like host person. She looked mad all the time and when she handed me my food,I'm the one who tell her thanks and have a good night. She doesn't answer me at all and just showed me that mad face. I want to ask her Where are the hell is your customer service?? 

The reason why I've keep ordered only for togo and stop going to seat and eat in this restaurant was because I don't want to see you guys' services anymore.!! And I really want to give a 1star but their foods are good so I left 2stars. 

Regular customer is not your friend.

2078707,2014-12-13,1,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"3.5 stars total. Had dinner here last night based on my friend's recommendation. I'd rate the service 4 stars. The staff tried a little too hard at being friendly, borderline intrusive, but was quick for the most part. The rolls came out in a timely manner, though the Hamachi Kama (salmon collarbone) took awhile. Drinks were refilled often. 

Comfort: One star. I sat in the center table and it was quite cramped to get in and out with the big chairs. This problem is magnified on a busy night as people are walking all over the place and it is a journey just to get to the nearby restroom. I sat at a table for four, though I was with just one friend; I could imagine it being exponentially uncomfortable if the table was full. The booth seems like it would've been a better experience. As every business day goes by, I don't see how they haven't noticed this issue. Maybe they do but figure it's not a problem worth fixing.

Food: 4 stars. Above average. The rolls were delicious and well crafted. Presentation was simple yet appealing. The Hamachi Kama was pretty standard, alongside the shrimp tempura. I wasn't thrilled about the Miso soup. I didn't finish it; maybe because it isn't really my thing, but it did seem quite salty/subpar. 

They offer a choice of one free of two appetizers if you check in on Yelp (hey, free is free; but now it's obviously more of an advertisement than a good deal as it doesn't say choose from two); edamame or cucumber salad (which I opted for). It was decent.

Overall a 3.5 stars. I could easily add another one star, and this place could become a go-to spot, if they worked on those issues. Prices were standard to a little high ($40-ish if you want to leave full). Not really feeling this place right now, but I'd probably come back again during happy hour when it's cheaper and less crowded.",b1wjZL3EBm4h2vbeXjfcTA,5,3,3,DilrrlPSS9qQgj9uQhl76g

That said, for Vegas, the prices here were quite reasonable. If a place like this were on the Strip at the same prices, this place would be ridiculously busy every night.

Me and my two friends went to this place on Saturday night. I had called an hour ahead for a quick reservation and actually got it, which surprised me. The staff was extremely courteous and the rolls were some of the best I've ever had. 

I got two of the expensive rolls, the Ultimate Naked ($15)and the Happy Ending ($12.50). That's probably as high-end as it will get in terms of the price range. The soft-shell crab on the Ultimate Naked was ridiculously good and the tuna from the Happy Ending was fresh and had more than enough flavor. The meal ran a shade over $30 but it was worth it. Will definitely come back here the next time I go to Vegas.

9/24/09 addendum: The Kamikaze roll, at $7, is MASSIVELY underrated. The Tiger & Dragon roll was also legit...love me some eel. And if you ever get the opportunity to try the Toro...DO IT.",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,3,3,5,5FWjlQznoRQOlUPC5tMqpw

It's located in a shopping plaza and is right next to a PT's Pub but don't worry you don't smell smoke or get any of the noise from PT's which is great! The inside is very trendy, cool and not too dark. The walls are covered in posters from all the Cirque Du Soleil shows with the perfomers signuatures, very nice touch. If you like sports you can still at the little bar (seating about 5 people max) and watch the chefs make food while you watch the two tv's behind them.

The food is downright amazing and I like how nothing is overcooked, undercooked or bland. The flavors are perfect and you don't need to add anything, just sit back and eat. Of course they have the ususal soy sauce, wasabi, etc but it's not really needed; I always eat a ton of wasabi just because I like the way it burns my nose haha. Also if you're into saki then you will love their large selection of different types! I tend to go torwards the stronger ones myself but I also like their sweet flavors.

The sushi was ok and the rolls were disgusting. The spicy tuna roll tasted like it had been pre-made and sitting in the fridge all day. The few rolls we tried that could pass as just average sushi hardly had any fish. They were mostly rice and vegetables. We kept trying different rolls hoping that it would be amazing like all the reviews had stated but we were so, so wrong. We left with a $100 bill and still hungry.

Whoever wrote that this place was a top restaurant obviously does not know what good food tastes like.

The wife and I were looking for a sushi dinner on last minutes notice after work and wanted to try something close to the house.  I found Naked Fish's here on Yelp and decided to give it a try... glad we did!

The restaurant was easy to find with ample parking for 5:50pm on a Friday night.  We parked right in front of the door and walked in, greeted by the smiling staff :)  We were escorted to a booth and again greeted by the sushi bar guys as with any friendly sushi spot.

From that point forward everything fell right into place to make for a great experience. Our server was attentive to all of our needs from the 1st to the last minute.  We ordered our Kirin's and just caught the happy hour special, so ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll & Spider Roll.  We got our beer a few minutes later then followed right after with our food.  It was awesome!  As we sat there, more people started to come in and fill up the seats.  We had perfect timing, but even still we noticed that everyone was being served quickly & attentively.  

As for the food, tasted fresh & quite delicious for being Happy Hour rolls. We noticed that even the tempura was cooked well as it wasn't soggy or soft. It was still warm and crispy :)  Only thing I'd say against the rolls is that the Spicy Tuna wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and the wasabi was not that spicy either. Kind of weird, but still really good.

After we finished that, we ordered the special Premium Toro w/ fresh wasabi & Salmon nigiri.  WOW.  The Toro was so soft and juicy.  It was a thick cut as well, definitely a great choice as our server had indicated they had just got it, so it was fresh!

All in all, we couldn't find a fault outside of not being able to fit any more in our belly.  We'll definitely be back for the Roppongi and a few other of the nigiri choices. Highly recommend this for sushi cravings.",fVyS3sE4XZ0aCt1ZGd4glw,1,1,4,2iwO6sVeLTlvKXya3UQBbw

I left so giddy with joy that I just had to come back and write a second review. Naked Fish's is the once and forever king of sushi in Las Vegas, and today I was fed a royal reminder of that fact.

I asked for ""some sashimi, whatever's good today"" and beer. Those may have been the most wisely chosen words I'd ever uttered. I was served bluefin, otoro, uni, red snapper, and something else, with fresh wasabi. Let me comment directly on a couple of these.

In all 3 of my previous experiences with uni, 2 of which were at sushi places in Vegas that I otherwise really enjoy, I just didn't like it. I felt like it was odd that people considered it a delicacy and I just didn't seem to understand why. Today I learned why. The uni I ate at Naked Fish's today was absolutely superb, and I melted with glee after my second - and third - bites.

Fresh wasabi? I've never once seen this in Vegas at any place other than Naked Fish's. It's such a nice touch and, for me, a critical part of enjoying the unmatched quality of fish served here.

This review is already far longer than I originally planned. Let me just put it this way: the food was so good I couldn't stop giggling throughout the entire meal, and at the end I tipped 125%. Merry (late) Christmas Naked Fish's!",3w-Mto6hHy5XxXO163bHTg,3,1,5,WOFxm2g1P4e2qwYskWM_Eg

2619334,2014-08-20,9,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"-Late night happy hour review-
(TL; DR - I prefer Yummy Grill & Sushi strictly based on their late night HH menu and their offering of nigiri at HH prices. Naked Sushi isn't a bad choice for late night sushi, but they also don't offer a great selection on their HH menu, they are more focused on rolls. Hey if that's your thing, ymmv!) 

I can't help but compare this place to the other local favorite, Yummy Grill & Sushi. I'll list the main similarities. 
-No AYCE
-Open late - past Midnight
-Offers a regular happy hour
-Offers a reverse (late night) happy hour
-Locals love it
-Great reviews on yelp

Here's the main difference: 
- Yummy's happy hour menu is much larger, with a better variety and also offers fresh and delicious nigiri! 
- Naked's happy hour menu is minimal and is mainly driven by cooked items and sushi rolls. 

We checked into Naked Sushi's on yelp and received a ""special"" appetizer, which was a small basket of edamame. Then we went straight to business and looked over the menu. The regular priced menu was extensive, but we specifically wanted to check out the late night happy hour menu available from 10 pm - 2 am (last call is actually at 1:45 am.) The late night happy hour offers one page of items ranging from: discounted beer, sake, soft drinks, appetizers, a tiny selection of a la carte rolls, or you can try their 3 roll combo, where you can select 3 rolls from their specified list for $21 - it's technically is a good deal because the majority of their rolls on the regular priced menu have a high price point - $14 each!? Yeeesh. 
 
We decided to give the 3 roll combo a go and selected (2 rolls from their standard roll list and 1 roll from their special roll list) 

Let me start off by saying, if you are like me and like to know exactly what's inside of the roll, well, their happy hour menu is a little disorganized and it becomes difficult to decide what roll to choose because they only list a random roll name with no description as to what's inside of it. We first tried asking our waiter what's inside of each roll, but then we figured that we would be there all night since we wanted to know the description of all 23+ rolls! We then realized that the regular menu had some of the descriptions of the vague rolls, so we thought it would be quicker to start flipping the pages back and forth to read the ingredients (instead of waiting for our server to try to remember whats inside of each roll...) Trust me, it all became very time consuming.

Here's what we finally ordered (in a fit of hunger) truthfully, we couldn't stand flipping the pages back and forth anymore: 

Haley Roll (Standard Roll) - shrimp tempura with avocado and crab. It's your typical, basic, crunchy roll. But why was it soggy and not crunchy? Flavor rating 3/5

Japanese Lasagna Roll (Standard Roll) - baked cream cheese, mayo, inside simple CA roll. The roll was rich, sweet and warm from the oven. It wasn't the worst version I've ever had, but I definitely wished that there was some sort of texture besides mushy/ soggy. Flavor rating 3/5

Grand Canyon Roll (Special Roll) - mix crab salad filling topped with baby scallops, mayo, baked, and topped with some roe. I honestly was not impressed at all. It's way too simple to be considered on their ""special"" roll menu. The tiny, minimal amount of baby scallops is just a gimmick. The roll wasn't memorable. Flavor rating 2/5

The same could be said on all 3 rolls:
- soggy, no texture 
- same flavor profile: basic + sweet mayo + unagi sauce
- filling, so you do get a bang for $21
- yet, I have to emphasize: definitely not worth regular pricing $14??
- they don't taste bad, but I guess I just expected more. 

Also, the other items we ordered off of the HH menu were disappointing: 

- Organic Miso soup (so fancy, I know) tasted fine, but came out lukewarm- not hot. :(
- Baked Mussels were filled silly with a crap-ton of imitation crab and topped with pungent bonito flakes, which took away from the flavor of everything else, also, not juicy and the tiny, bitty piece of mussel got lost in the madness. (Bonito flakes are great, but I honesty felt that it killed the flavors here)
- Salmon Nigiri wasn't sweet, it was fibrous and tough to chew. 
- Ama Ebi - which was the advertised special of the day and it was huge! But sadly, it wasn't sweet at all and very firm and tough to chew. My paranoia tells me it's aka-ebi and not ama-ebi...

Let's end the review on a positive note: The best thing all night was the albacore nigiri!! It was super delicate, moist, sweet, fresh, and buttery. I would recommend ordering that for sure!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,12,9,3,WgefgvlwduS9D_u2tnzVbA

1 edamame
1 GTR roll
1 Haley roll
1 kamikaze roll
1 scallop roll

My favorite was the GTR roll, which was actually recommended to me by our waitress! To be honest all rolls were really delicious.

Please see my picture for the tuna collar special we got... it was HUGE and tasted perfect when drizzled with lemon and dipped in ponzu sauce. 

There are a few TVs inside, behind the sushi bar. They had two of the bball games on :)

I got a tip off from a coworker that their Uni is the freshest here and she only dines here for it. So I got curious and my Mom loves Uni.. why not give this place a try.

We were kindly greeted by our server, Wanda. Cheerful and direct, she let us know that HH just started and the specials for today. She's very informative and details of each dish was emphasized to the point where I could have envisioned it right before my very own eyes! 

Our appetite chose the Shima Aji - Striped Jack (specials), Premium Uni from Santa Barbara (specials), Shigoku Oysters (specials), Avocado Roll (HH), Yuzu Salmon (HH), and Yellowtail Jalapeno (HH).

My loves:

I admit.. all those specials we ordered were FRESH. It felt like we were at sea and they just caught it. Opened, cut it up, and served us ;) Shima Aji had a clean finish.. pure texture as in smooth and rich. If you've been looking for sashimi with no fishy odor/taste and ends with a sweet, calm note.. Shima Aji is the best for Summer! I would order this over and over again. Highly recommend this special while it's around. 

Premium Uni here could possibly seduce you in falling in love with Uni, itself. Obsessive kind of love. Beautiful presentation. The color of a sliced mango.. deep, deep orange. I get a kick out of the grainy texture that reminded me of a very dry tongue. Say Ahhh!!! Buttery, sweet, and fresh tasting. Surprisingly, it has a hint of floral. It came with a generous amount of 4 pieces of Uni per nigiri order. I was in Uni heaven!!! Layer after layer I was relishing each bite. Definitely order this or you're going to be missing out on something truly pleasurable to your taste buds. So good, sooooooooo GOOD. 

Yuzu Salmon presentation had bursting, vibrant colors that made the dish so enticing. Nicely sliced and pleasantly clean flavor.

Unfortunately, the flash flood warning went off at the restaurant and my phone. So we had to scarf down on our last dishes of Avocado Roll and Yellowtail Jalapeno sashimi. Looking through the window from our comfy booth seating.. those clouds look mean.. destructive mean. I had to ask for the check pronto and told our server, Wanda.. my MINI can't survive any floods.. I have to get going.. and she goes.. then you better go. While the staff yells out thank you.. we took off like ghost rider. 

This place was packed during Happy Hour (HH) 5p-6p/10p-2a and love the fact that they played some great UFC/MMA fights while enjoying our meal here. My mom was oddly engaged in those matches. Getting my attention with.. Look! Look at this guy get kneed in the ribs!!! I was like what the heck he lost from that?! UFC/MMA sushi action! Naked Fish is as real as it gets for your Sushi needs!

You never expect to have good, fresh sushi in Las Vegas, but this place had that, and more. Even while I am here in L.A., I am anticipating my next visit to Vegas to dine at Naked Fish with my mother again.

Where do I begin? We did a tapas style effect - after all, sharing is caring: Hambaga Steak, Tonkatsu, Vegetable Tempura, Amaebi, Bluefin Fatty Toro, Miso Butter Seabass, and the Lisa Lisa Roll. I missed out on the Oysters and Mirugai! Unfortunately this place is fresh enough that they run out of their stuff! Which is a DEFINITE good sign.

I could write a long review on the decadence of this place, but what really stood out for me, was the Toro. It melted in my mouth, not quite the way it did at Tsukiji fish market, but as much as I can hope for Stateside. And the Miso Butter Seabass: My beau is allergic to seafood, noteably fish, but he tore it up. It was so fresh that it did not affect him (Nor did the Toro). In fact, he loved it so much, he pounded it out, absorbing everything, and said that it was quite possibly one of the BEST things he's ever had in his mouth.

I used to think that the best and cheapest way to eat sushi (in Vegas) is buffet style. I have been to Kobe Sushi and Oyshi Sushi. Basically you pay $25+ for really crappy sushi. And by crappy I mean sushi that is not fresh and is drenched in different kind of sauces to hide the fact that it is not fresh. I was in Vegas a week ago and I had a Eureka moment. I realized that if you go to a non-buffet sushi place, the cost will come out to be the same or cheaper than at a buffet. 

To test my assumption, my friend and I went to Naked Fish. We came here around noon time and it was really crowded. We were both super hungry and wanted to order everything on the menu. We ended up getting the lunch time special. We ordered a 3 roll combo ($19.95) and it comes with miso soup and salad. The miso soup and salad were ok, but the rolls were A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.! I was really surprised at how fresh the sushi were. We ordered the scallop roll, Kamikaze, and Dark Circle Roll. 

1. Scallop Roll (6pc)
This was a really traditional roll with just scallops. Normally, I would never get scallops at a sushi restaurant because it is usually not fresh enough for me. The scallops at sushi restaurants are usually drenched in some kind of sauce to mask the lack of freshness. However, I was really impressed with the scallops here. This roll was very simple and fresh. Perfecto!

2. Kamikaze (8pc)
This was one of their specialty roll. It has fresh water eel, advocado, spicy tuna, served with eel sauce). Both my friend and I loved this too!

3. Dark Circle (5pc)
Another specialty, it has shrimp, kani kama, fresh water eel with spicy tuna, avocado, kizami on top, served with eel sauce. This roll didn't disappoint.

In addition to the lunch combo, we also ordered their infamous Tuna Tataki Salad ($15.95). This has seared tuna with tataki sauce. This salad was delicious as well! The greens that they used was fresh, tuna was fresh, and so was the avocado! 

Our total meal was about $38 for two people! Score!!

Next time, I really want to try the chef omakase sashimi. It is only $15 per person!!

Note: the lunch time combo has different combos to pick from. For #1 combo, you get to pick 1 out of 12 rolls. For #2 combo, you get to pick 2 out 22 rolls. For #3 combo, you get to pick 3 out of 37 rolls. Rolls range from traditional Japanese to specialty.

Xtra Note: during the weekday, they are open for lunch/dinner. weekends are dinner only.",-AJlByb8daR97XtiHKqQUA,1,1,5,5cagod-U-iPj8zPeEJbRcQ

Immediately after arriving my girlfriend and I were seated in the dining room, which, one could characterize as cozy.

I've always found it entertaining to watch sushi chefs whip together the splendid rolls I so so crave.

The sushi chefs at Naked work quickly and precisely in every roll they make and the servers and wait staff are friendly and knowledgable.  Needless to say after my fifth roll and third order of sake I was satisfied and pleased with the entire experience.

As mentioned in other Yelp reviews, Wanda is great for suggestions (seems like she's been there forever...).  On my most recent visit, as soon as my Mrs and I walked in...Wanda immediately recommended one of their daily specials: ""Bluefin Tuna Collar!"" She told us that if we like Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar), we will really enjoy the taste of Bluefin Collar. She added that the bluefin collar is a treat as they only get it on occasion and it takes a little longer to prepare.

We told her we would try it...while we were waiting for it to be prepared, we each started off with Asari Clam Miso soup and we shared a House salad. We added orders of the yellowtail jalapeño and a Kamikaze roll. Everything was tasty, but we were anxious to try the bluefin tuna collar...when it arrived (took about 20 mins) it was worth the wait. It was simply delicious! It was tender & succulent...to get to the ""meaty"" portion we had dig inside & under the collar bone...so you have to be willing to do the ""extra work.""

Went here about a year ago and decided we needed to go back again and take some friends.

Their rolls are really good and we loved every one that we ordered...especially GT-R... but you go here for the raw fish.

They get fresh almost everyday and their menu board changes so you need to pay attention.

The Kampachi last night was fabulous.... melt in your mouth like butter.

The Aji (I can't remember the whole name)... white fish with a bit of pink on the edge and silver skin... was amazing.  Meaty and firm... not oily or fishy.

And the Dynamite appetizer....is ... Dy-No-Mite!  The shredded smoked seaweed on top was an excellent addition that added another dimension to the taste profile.

And if you're a Ginger lover like we are.... Best Ginger!  Fresh, sweet, crunchy and juicy.  

We ordered a bunch of items and had beer to boot so our total bill was $164 for 4 people. Yes, a bit pricey but we had a great time.

I've eaten at other Sushi places here in Vegas that were either so-so, too expensive or in a casino which always exhausts me, but I finally stumbled onto a place that fits the bill.  Naked Fish was charming, reasonable and delicious...definitely staking a claim to be in my stable of regular eateries.  I also love that their sushi chefs were Japanese.  Not saying that other ethnicities cant make great sushi, but its just one of those things that makes sense to me.  

Situated in a non-descript strip mall on the westside of town, Naked Fish is a small restaurant that has an even tinier sushi bar (5 seats I think) but what it lacks in size it makes up for in ambition.  The menu has a nice selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi, rolls and grilled entrees.  On my visit, we did a smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi that was fantastic.  The comment that immediately came to mind for all those in my party was the freshness of the fish.  The taste and quality of a fresh product cant be duplicated and so many sushi places trot out marginal seafood that you can tell isnt as fresh as probably advertised.  The amazing freshness of the fish was especially evident in the sashimi where it cant hide behind rice and other accoutrement like in rolls.  We did their Omakase sashimi option which for a set price puts your faith in the sushi chefs and they send out a nice platter based on their whims that evening.  For three people it was $50 and there was everything from Bluefin, to Jackfish to tempura style prawns.   It was enough for all of us to feel full, especially after starting off with an order or Spider rolls and California rolls which were phenomenal...but it was that cool Sushi type full where you dont feel like you need to put on sweat pants in wallow in your filth, like when you have too much pizza.  

Service for the evening was credible and friendly and they took the time to explain everything that was sent out to us which is always a big help, especially when dining with sushi novices.  On a side note, its kind of interesting, but the restaurant actually has some great views of Las Vegas.  I know what you're thinking; How can that be in a strip mall?  Well because the parcel across the street is undeveloped, it allows for an unhindered view of the Vegas strip about 6 miles away...especially pretty when the sun is setting.  Remember that you future prince charmings when you need to impress a girl!  Also, they have a food happy hour until 6pm I believe that gives discounts on a number of rolls and appetizers.

I can't really get around the idea of baked sushi to be honest, and it's just too weird a concept for me. Maybe I'll get one of their baked rolls the next time. 

Spicy salmon was pretty standard. I didn't really like the salmon skin roll too much- it was a little overcooked and I had a hard time biting through the salmon skin, it's too crispy and hard. Oh, and we also got an edamame as our yelp check-in deal. That was pretty nice. 

Service was pretty attentive. Our server is the same petite, friendly asian lady that we had the last time. This time round though, she did try to sell us seltzer water and asked us a little too many times if we wanted to order more. Once or twice is okay, but I always felt that if you asked me like 3-4 times if I want more food, it does turn me off a little. Good thing she always ask with a smile, and I suppose she is after all, doing her job. 

I'll probably be back just for the happy hour. To be honest, I kinda hope they condense the menu a little- all the fancy names for the rolls get me really confused, and I take a longer time trying to process through the menu. Not a good thing if they want to increase their turnover.",LMJKMZOEiQpWNMBT2G2t_A,0,0,4,lb5AlrBsAF18X0am3Jajow

This small little place is impressive & you almost ALWAYS know that it is gonna be close to authentic Japanese when you walk into a small little nice & simply decorated place! They have about maybe 6 booths & 4/5 tables.... nicely spread out so it's not invading your neighbor table's conversation & about 6/8 seats at the sushi bar. 

We were greeted right away ""Ira shai ma sae"" from the chefs & seated right away. The service was great! I think our server's name was SALLY (don't quote me...) she was very informative & told us about all the specials which we pretty much ordered MOST of them!

They have HAPPY HOUR everyday 10pm- 2am everyday which is AWESOME! Also 5pm- 6pm as well. But the late night happy hour for 4 hours!! Ummm yea... ahhahaha

MIRUGAI SASHIMI 5 piece $22.50 - ummmm.... OMG!!!! so little places in Vegas can I find my favorite of all favorite clams!! The GIANT clam! So good typically crunchy but they sliced it all up so it was not as crunchy as they sliced the LIFE out of it. Just gotta ask them not to do that NEXT time.

LIVE AMAEBI SUSHI $11 - this plate was absolutely gorgeously plated & you could tell the freshness of the sweet shrimp because of how stiff the tail was & the deep fried head was so MEATY!! 1 order is 1 shrimp. 

SALMON SUSHI $5 - hubby said it just melted away

HALIBUT JALEPENO $12 - This was good but I was a little DISAPPOINTED on the lack of freshness... halibut is MY FISH & I have a taste buds of a cat when it comes to this delicious fish.

GOLD UNI SUSHI $12 - gold represents the quality & boi was it GOLD in flavor along w/ color! We had an order for appetizer then an order for dessert!

TAKO WASABI $4 - the amount that they give you for this dish is RIDICULOUS!! We couldn't taste too much wasabi but we found out it's because they ran out of fresh pickled wasabi =[ but still good.

SHIGOKU OYSTER $7 - tiny little oysters that we're so cute & gone in less than a second. 2 pieces per order.

ROCK & ROLL #1 $15 - a no rice roll that our server chose for us... ahhaha we have had this roll in many different places so we weren't too impressed... but her enthusiasm for her choice was cute. Thinly sliced cucumber wrapped around Tuna, Salmon, Crab Stick, Yellow Tail, & Sprouts.

ORGANIC MISO SOUP $3 - it was just miso soup... probably won't order it again for 3 bux

HH GREEN BEAN TEMPURA $4 - you get a GOOD amount of green beans... definitely could have been a little more CRISPIER.

GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE $7 - DERICIOUS you could definitely taste the green tea & it is served w/ a strawberry sherbert w/ whip cream. My photo really does no justice 

MOCHI ICE CREAM $4 - I dunno why we ordered mochi... ahahaa you could get a whole box at the market.

MAN'S MOUNTAIN JUNAMI SAKE $12.50 - rich & dry at the same time... came in a cute little craft w/ ice filled in the whole to keep it chilled.

3207302,2009-06-22,8,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"This place continues to be my at-least-weekly sushi spot.

Two weeks ago, on a Tuesday, they shut down the restaurant for the day.  I have gotten to know the sushi chefs there, so when I asked them what happened, they told me that it was because they received a shipment of sub-par tuna that day.  Since so many customers order tuna on any given day (rolls, spicy tuna, etc), they decided it was best to just close for the day rather than try and salvage some of the bad tuna.

That is the definition of integrity.  I don't know any other sushi restaurant in town that would sacrifice a day of revenue because of a situation like that.  Definitely not Sushi-Mon or any of the Korean run sushi restaurants in town - no way.  

I think that speaks highly of the owner and the importance he puts on consistently serving only the highest quality fish.

Other than that, I don't have much of an update.  I continue to order many of my favs I've written about in the past including GT-R roll, hamachi, aji, ika ten.

First, the view. From any booth you can see the entire strip. For non-Vegas local, this is a mesmerizing view - and it's a clear one - Stratosphere to Luxor. 

Second, the warm greetings. Very friendly. Asked where we would like to sit, instead of traditional table herding. 

Third, quick service to provide drinks. Their sake menu was amazing. Everything was color coded and classed and easy to read. With much experience in sake, I could easily say this would be great for rookies. 

Fourth, excellent menu. We dined to the point of gluttony. 

Kobe beef tataki with garlic chips - amazing!
Negi toro roll - melts in your mouth
Organic miso soup - best I've had
Organic miso with clams - SO had, three large clams included
Nigiri variety (Japanese uni, chu toro, salmon belly, hamachi belly, tuna, halibut)
Two rolls (sunset - the best roll I've ever had in my life, soft shell crab) 

Then dessert. SO got the strawberry sorbet and I got the green tea creme brûlée (favorite dessert ever) with fresh whipped cream and a surprise scoop of strawberry sorbet.

This place deserves 5 stars partially because of their food, partially because of their great reverse happy hour and cheap lunch specials, and partially because of their service.

Service at Naked Fish always sticks out because of the extra mile attention to detail that each server gives. Most of them know our orders before we even make it and this is even after not eating there for 1-2 months.

The sushi here is always fresh and the rolls are creative and delicious. I used to have a problem with the way their sashimi was priced but they have since fixed that. If you are looking for cheap sushi you should definitely try their lunch specials where you can have 3 rolls for under $20 and this includes most of their most expensive rolls.

3508733,2010-02-10,0,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"Ok, let me preface this by saying that though this is my first Yelp review, I'm not one of these folks who comes on here just to write one scathing review based on a single bad experience.  I've been reading Yelp reviews for a few years now, and always use it as a foremost authority before hitting up any new Vegas eateries.  My lady and I are also relentless foodies, frequenting restaurants of all genres and price ranges all over town and every time we travel.  I guess what I'm trying to say is...this ain't my first rodeo.

For comparison's sake, and/or to put my preferences into context, one of my favorite sushi spots is Sushi Mon on Sahara, which I find to be pretty darn good (not amazing, but good people, quick service, and good all-you-can-eat value).  We were a bit keen on trying a new place, and Naked Fish had been recommended to us by a few people.  So of course, I came on Yelp and saw nothing but pristine 4 and 5 star reviews.  Safe to say I was chomping at the bit to get in to Naked Fish and try it out.

AWFUL.  To say I was disappointed would be the understatement of the year.  We dropped $130 and ended up getting Taco Bell on the way home.  The rolls were MINUSCULE.  I suppose that if you're a gringo and your idea of ""sushi"" is rice, seaweed and ginger, this is the place for you.  But where was the fish?  It was almost impossible to differentiate between the different types of fish we were eating because the cuts were so tiny.  We ordered about 7 or 8 different rolls from their limited menu, and afterwards the only thing I was thinking was, ""Damn, these all taste the same.""  

I say ""limited menu"" because the vast majority of their rolls were some sort of fried or baked varieties.  Those aren't really my preference as it's generally difficult to taste the fish.  But hell, maybe those would've been better than the nonsense we were eating.

That said, the sushi chefs were nice, though extremely slow, and the sake was delicious.  Unfortunately, I might feel that way because it was the only thing I had to help wash down the tasteless ""sushi"" that I was (reluctantly) ingesting.

There wasn't much of a selection but the prices were very inexpensive, about $4 for each roll. We ordered the 911 roll (definitely a must-try), my all time favorite the Japanese Lasagna, the Naked Girls roll, the Philadelphia roll, the Haley roll, and their weekly special the Sunset Roll. Every single roll was tasty, no disappointment whatsoever. 

As for the drinks on the happy hour menu, they only offered beer, sake, and wine. I'm guessing they didn't have a full bar. Off the happy hour menu, I ordered some sort of sake cocktail called the Pineapple Shirley Temple, at about $4 as well. Very delicious, I'd definitely recommend!

I gave Naked Sushi 4 stars since the service was a little slow. We waited a while to order, to finally get the food, and even when we had to pay. I hope this place doesn't get too busy, I don't know how they'd be able to handle that.

Obviously it is quite different here and it took a lot of trial and error and sadness for me to realize there is nothing even close to my favorite places in L.a. At one point I had tried all the sushi places in town with only Nobu coming close to the quality I was used to. While they have great food, their prices are ridiculous so that was out of the question. 

I actually gave up on sushi until I gave in to a friend's recommendation and tried Naked Sushi. They didn't disappoint and while they are still not on the level of L.a. they are close. I love their house rolls and tempura offerings and the freshness of the fish for sashimi is great. 

They could be a bit cheaper but really since they are the only good place in town, I don't mind paying. The service is amazing, I always get the same lady as my waitress (I will need to catch her name to give her credit). She is always enthusiastic, helpful, and attentive.

I think I liked this place in part because our waitress was very helpful and gave us recommendations that were distinct and dead-on for the nigiri and sashimi. We also got some rolls that were well-balanced and crunchy (okay, I couldn't help myself and got one tempura roll- I know some people don't consider those fried rolls real sushi, but damn, they're good!).

Low lighting, lots of locals (or at least people that seemed to know each other really, really well). 

I would come back here. We got the house sake warm and it wasn't terrible when it started to become cold (actually, I've never had saki before so I have nothing to compare it to! For shame...)

Still, our bill was around sixty dollars with tip for two sets of fancy rolls, sake, beer, and a plentiful portion of nigiri and sashimi (we tried at least  five or six different kinds of fish). Plus we had edamame. I'm just thinking how much MORE it would have been if we had eaten by the casinos. Damn.

One of the many reasons I love living on this side of town. This place satiates my cravings without having to drive down to China town.

My absolute favorite dish on the menu is the Grilled Sea Bass with Miso Butter. The sea bass just melts in your mouth. Grilled to perfection, it is juicy and tender...absolutely delicious. So good that I took a bite before snapping a photo...such a bad yelper. I flipped it around and made a photo happen regardless though ;) The miso butter sauce compliments it perfectly but is great without it as well. 

Overall the quality of their fish is very fresh. Prices are reasonable. You can get an amazing meal here for the price that you would pay at an AYCE sushi joint but enjoy an overall hands down better meal.

My boyfriend and I shared three rolls: The Lisa Lisa roll, the Sunset Roll, and Tiger/Dragon roll. 

My favorite was the Lisa Lisa. The outside of the roll has an incredible crunch to it and a mayo sauce that is probably the best I have ever had. The fish tasted like fresh fish that did not have the nasty fishy taste that we have all unfortunately experienced once in our lives. Thank goodness this place has FRESH ingredients all around. You see the sushi chef's make your food to order. The place looks and feels clean. The waitress was sweet and did an excellent job giving us recommendations. I highly recommend the Tiger/Dragon roll if you love eel and avocado. The sunset roll was also tasty with a hint of spice to it since the inside had spicy tuna. 

We did not get dessert, but the ice cream that passed by us looked pretty tasty! Get a large Sapparo there or the plum wine. It will add a nice addition to your overall meal. I will definitely come back here again since it is reasonably priced and away from the strip so getting there is much more convenient. I recommend calling ahead to see how long the wait is.

The sushi is perfectly good and fresh, and they have some great rolls, though we typically stick more to nigiri and sashimi. The uni and scallop is always very fresh and they almost always have toro.

Pros:

*Price. It's not the best sushi you will ever try, but it's good enough, and you pay a lot less here than you will at high-end places on the strip.
*Open super late! Sometimes we don't get around to calling in an order until 10pm, so it's nice that it's open so late.
*Huge fish selection

Cons:
*Ambiance is a very typical hole-in-the-wall Japanese place, nothing special (doesn't matter if you get takeout or are just in the mood for something casual)

We had 5 rolls, soup, gyoza, kalbi, baked mussels and miso sea bass. Everything was delicious. Some things were excellent. 

I would certainly return for the happy hour. They had lots of special rolls that vary from other places.

 You walk into a small, quite, subtly lit place that had a nice view of the strip from high up in the valley looking down on the night lights.  We open the menu to find they have Uni shipped in a way to have it maintain its freshness and flavor an amazing and wonderful feat in my eyes.  BTW I was impressed on this day of the freshness of the Uni and my BF was in love of it!  They also have live shrimp (Amaebi ) the heads can be prepared two different ways fried or into a soup, both are on my favorite list.  They have quite a selection of rolls some cooked some raw with special sauces on them.  They also have a nice selection of fresh good quality sushi and sashimi they offer fresh Wasabi for a small fee.  We ordered a few cooked items as well for our friend all of which were as good as the rest of the choices we made!  I recommend Hamachi Kama (collar).

But to be candid and forthright...
The food is incredible.  It's fresh...or appropriately aged as necessary. It's inventive.  It's astonishing to me that in the middle of one of the driest place on the planet they have access to some of best tasting sashimi and sushi that I've ever had.
I haven't opened a menu in years.
If you live in LV and love sushi then in my opinion you have no excuse to not try Naked Fish.
If you are just visiting, it can be a bit of a haul from the strip.

Seriously, how on earth is is possible to get top of the line sushi... in the middle of the desert. Naked Fish puts coastal sushi restaurants to shame. I don't know how they do it, but they have some how managed to provide a great sushi experience without a natural body of water in sight.

We were on the tail end of a road trip when we decided to make a Vegas detour and being the sushi-monsters that we are sushi was on the brain. Yelped and found Naked Fish.
Went in, nice atmosphere, dark wooded and cosy. 
We ordered the Naked Crab for appetiser, which was very nice. We then proceeded to order 2 rolls and then a third. For the first two we had the GTR, spicy tuna and shrimp tempura together is always a hit, and then the Kamikaze, which I loved as I'm an eel fan.

First, we ordered a 'premium' chirashi bowl. When we usually order this, it is generous portion of 'premium' fish. However, although the portion was pretty good, the quality of the fish was not so good. Uni-which they only gave us one piece, when usually two, was very fishy, and their shrimp was horribly sweet as well as their tamago. Salmon was one piece cut into two small pieces, and I could tell because i saw the knife mark. Overall flavor of the rice too was WAY TOO SWEET. The furikake that they put on the rice was overwhelming that we had to remove all the top part of the rice; however, the fish that was covering the rice was already absorbing all the sweetness so it was too late. We also ordered natto maki and mentaiko & ika maki. Those were not too bad, but we have had better natto that the ones at NF. 

Also, their service was just HORRIBLE. The server doesnt even greet us and asks us to order. We order one item and he just leaves the table- and that was how the whole serving went last night. We ordered cold sake, and the ice hole had one single ice in it. One ice probably won't keep a sake cold enough. Also, he would just leave the bottle at the corner of the table, not saying anything, so we didnt even realize the bottle was there. When it got to be HH, we had to ask for the menu, but the server never came to the table to take our order but he did make sure to go around and check on the other tables. We ended up ordering through their manager, who when we complained about the service, just didn't care at all and took our menu away. Surprisingly, we received our orders, but we were so ready to leave the place. 

There are so many restaurants recently opening with better quality and service. No wonder why Naked Fish gets slower everytime I go.

I have NEVER been asked in a sushi restaurant if I wanted rice along with my sashimi and have always had to ask for it.  But not here, it was offered.  Man, my husband and I were so impressed.  

To top it all off, maybe it was because we caught the tail end of happy hour, but the entire over-the-top meal of 3 carafes of sake, 3 rolls, and an omekase platter, came out to less than $100 bucks.

But my friend told me it was worth it, so I decided to give it a try.  Boy was he right, the interior design gives off a warm and cozy vibe and the people here are really nice.  Although I did wish our dishes all came out the same time, the atmosphere of it was great.  

Since I was a first timer, I didn't know what to order and so I turned to yelp for some help. I ordered the:

- Naked pizza - this was delicious, I tried forever to figure out what the dough was. It tasted like crunchy rice with something to hold it together.  All I know is that it was good. It's a definite must if you're here.

- Yuzu Salmon - OHHHHH BOOOYYY! This dish made my night!  The rightly sliced salmon placed with onions and some other sauces that complimented the texture of the salmon. WOW! I would definitely order this again! It was my favorite out of the whole dishes.  

Nzu Mussels - It was action packed and delicious, but it's nothing I haven't tasted before.  The shredded crab was a good compliment to the mussels, along with the bonito shavings.  

Hamburger Steak w/ teriyaki sauce - It was an ok dish, a little too much on the sweet side.  Probably not something I'd order again.

Japanese Lasagna Roll - I'm not a big fan of baked rolls, just because the rice always comes out a little too soggy.  

911 Roll - It was good, but nothing special

Wasu Beef Kushi - OMG! The meat for this was so tender and juicy, it felt like an explosion of goods in my mouth.  Although it's only one skewer, it's well worth it to try it once.  

The menu is small, and a little on the pricey side but the dishes are delicious and have flavor.  I'd probably return here to try out some other dishes, I wish they'd extend there menu.

The food was just so-so. I've had better sushi. It was fresh enough but completely unremarkable. There was lots of differently named rolls. But, we ordered two of the spiciest rolls on the menu (marked by 4 & 5 chili icons) and had to add extra wasabi & ginger just to get a little heat. We even asked the server (who never told us her name) to kick up the heat on the 2nd round - still only worth 2 chillies. The drinks were kinda tasty thought; we got Shiso Mojitos in very small champagne glasses for 3 and half bucks. So that was cool.

The service was sllllllllow. The server was nice enough (although she made some comment like monkey-see-monkey-do that really rubbed my brother the wrong way). We ordered several rolls the 1st round (about 8). They came out about two at a time with about 10 mins. between each set. So we remained hungry the entire night. Maybe this was the plan for us to order more rolls. But with 7 adults at the table, we'd each have a piece of roll and have to wait for more food to come out. It was frustrating.

The seating was just horrible. We reserved for a party of ten. The whole restaurant seemed as if it would only seat 50. In order to get food into the main dining area, the server has to pass in front of the restaurant's entry door. This ""restaurant"" is more of a cafe'. If everyone that we wanted to share in this occasion came with us, the restaurant would not have held everyone. If they have a party of more than ten, I am pretty sure they'd have to close the restaurant to other guests.

The best part of the evening was the end. My son got a free ice-cream desert for being the graduate. The gratuity was not added in, so we could appropriate an adequate tip-to-service ratio. And the bill for the whole affair was still under $200.

So if you want an inexpensive sushi meal, this is a good place for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way and make plans to go here. It's a good drop-in-on-the-way-to spot but nothing spectacular.",F_PGwNib2ntDfosxfCzciw,3,0,2,W5VFmbvT8lWqMYtFov6eaA

And the first place Kuge at at, was Naked Fish.  And after a year+ of trying different places/kinds of sushi establishments.  Naked Fish by far Kuge's overall best sushi experience.

Not one time has Kuge experienced crappy service.  The service is great, fast, friendly, and are willing to make sure you leave happy.

The overall value you get from the sushi is superb, the price is affordable, the fish is fresh and sushi is great.  The Great One cannot recall eating a anything he completely didn't like from them.  It's a nice location and so calming to be there.

The happy hour special's are great and for Kuge that is the icing on top of the cake.

Nice ambience inside, as others had described. The waitress was kind and very attentive. One and two stars there.

The numerous times I came here almost everything was delicious. Whether it was their Ultimate Naked Roll, Kai, Dark Circle, or Dragon Fly everything was just good. Their gyoza, soft shell crab,  mackerel, shrimp tempura, and Asian lamb chop, and Japanese spaghetti were all good as well. But one thing that really stood out and still bothered me was the bonzai roll, it just had the fishy seafood taste which is a sign of bad sushi. It was really bad. Could have just been a bad roll. Everything else on the menu is good though.

Service:
Wait staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very friendly with the young child that was in our group, giving him a toy car and quick to clean up the small mess he made. But, the wait staff wasn't shy about offering our Vietnamese co-worker a fork, since he kept dropping his sushi with the chopsticks. BURNNNNNNN!

Price:
After comparing to other sushi places, Naked Fish is price fairly competitive based on what you get. You can't compare to all you can eat places, but if you want quality sushi without breaking the bank this is the place to go. Rolls range from $6 all the way to the $15 Ultimate Naked Roll.

Second I saw that they had Kumamoto oysters, and I am such an oyster lover and as most lovers know, not alot of off the strip places have quality oysters like that, so I had to get them. Preferably I like my oyster plain so I can control whats on them, they had some sort of a ponzu ginger sauce on them with scallions which was fine, and yes the oyster met my standards. we also got hamachi sashimi which was plump and delicious also, as well as the hamachi collar and the happiness roll. The roll was pretty good but not at all the best I've had, there was a little more seaweed salad in the roll than the Ahi that comes with it, but the little crunch of the garlic sitting on top kinda made the roll for me, it dispersed just the right amount of garlic for that roll. In conclusion my overall experience for food was exceptional for the price your paying and the quality and service you got, and btw the service was awesome(we sat ot the sushi bar w Peter). A large kirin split, a large carafe of chilled sake, kanpachi and hamachi sashimi, happiness roll, kumamoto oysters, hamachi collar, strawberry and green tea mochi ice cream, and $135 later($98 for bill, $17 for server, $10 for sushi chefs), it was a well worth dining experience and I would go back in a heart beat!",y-0Nshj21iCw5Q9mS_N23A,0,0,4,slGuZ1Ntw3qUZ0CSTlO1qw

I don't know why so many people rave about this place it's probably because a lot of well known poker players eat here but who really cares about that? The portions are SO SMALL and I'm a small girl only 93 pounds at 5'2 so if I say the portions are small then you know there is something wrong. The sushi is overpriced especially because even though the fish is fresh I've had fresher sushi at other places at a better price. The waitresses were horrible and there were 3 of them standing there doing nothing. They even forgot one of our orders so we just canceled it which was probably a good idea since the sushi wasn't really worth waiting for or for the price. The happy hour isn't anything special and isn't worth a trip there just for that. I think this place is so overrated!

You can get three rolls and a beer for a very reasonable price, as well as some budget friendly appetizers.

This is a small restaurant, but unless you go on a weekend evening, there shouldn't be much if any wait. Service is fast and friendly, and it is quite cute inside, too. 

They do this great tuna salad (I forget the actual name of it), and they have some really inventive and tasty original rolls. The fish is always fresh and cut well. Other highlights have been the green bean tempura, squid, and any roll that involves an element of crunch.

This is typically not my usual sushi joint, but last night we decided to eat at Naked Fish. It's right around the corner from my house and it has a great view of the strip. Also, our last experience at our normal sushi spot was a little more than disappointing.

I know I've eaten here a few times before and it's always been delicious, but unfortunately it is not AYCE, which is always something I look forward to for the price. 
Sometimes, you need to spend a little for quality, and after last nights tasty selections, I will embrace that philosophy for them. 

We ordered the Screaming Orgasm Salad (a must), the Ultimate Naked Roll (yum), the Lisa Lisa (my boyfriend loves the crunch and cream cheese) and the Roppongi roll (super yum) All were top notch. 

The tuna on the Screaming Orgasm was the freshest I've seen yet in this town. The color was perfect and the cuts were clean. I wish I had taken a picture of it, but by the time I thought of it, we had already devoured the plate. 

The Roppongi (the waitress told us it was the most popular roll) was pretty darn delicious as well. Probably my favorite, along with the Screaming O.  All the rolls we ordered were great. 

The price wasn't all that bad, considering the quality of the meal, so although it is not AYCE, and most sushi places are offering that, I would recommend Naked Fish if looking for some top grade fish.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,0,4,Y5XF9BGSChs0Ya3TWhev0Q

I got the roppangi roll (14$)  as rec'd by yelp reviewers as well as the Yuzo Salmon appetizer (12$). So overpriced and overhyped for what you get. *see pics* 

the roppangi roll is drenched in sauce, the flavor is decent, but Naked Fish's rolls are the tiny sized rolls with unremarkable bits of fish on top, so even if the fish was fresh I couldn't tell. 

I don't understand what the hype is about the Salmon appetizer. It was thin pieces of salmon, drenched with lemon, maybe radish and a type of fish egg/masago thing. The extreme lemon totally obscured the flavor of the salmon, and the cuts were so thin that I couldn't even tell if the fish was fresh.  Salmon is pretty hard to screw up regardless. 

To top that the service was pretty slow, and  me and my roommates rolls kept coming out at separate times so we would never be eating at the same time. 

Oh, and the Mochi ice cream was Bad.  $4 for two pieces of mochi and the mochi on the outside was thin and hard (not soft and chewy like gelatinous mochi rice should be)

I went for their late night happy hour and PLEASE don't get me wrong. I will always give this place 5 stars for service and 5 stars for quality. But their sushi roll selection on their late night happy hour is VERY limited.

Here's the issues I have..

#1 If you have a funky name like Lisa Lisa roll then put the description of what's in the roll with the item, I shouldn't have to flip through the other section of the full menu to find out the details.  

#2 They didn't even have a basic spicy tuna roll on happy hour (I've never heard of that before but sure enough, they didn't offer it)

#3 They were actually slightly higher priced then some other places like Lahaina Grill for their happy hour rolls (but to give them credit, their quality is above Lahaina Grill) 

However I'd rather goto Lahaina Grill for a larger selection of happy hour rolls vs the very limited choices I had here.

I was quite disappointed with the choices.  Again, please don't get me wrong, their quality of what they offer on their menu is VERY good and slightly higher prices because of that.  They even have a very good lunch menu. However you really need to improve on that happy hour menu and because of that I won't go back when I'm lookin for some cheap happy hour specials vs all you can eat.

I will say this the quality is on point and they know how to make sushi but I'm probably not coming back anytime soon because what we had wasn't memorable.

Yes, they are both gone completely, not simply removed from their late night happy hour menu. They have revised the menu and the happy hour offerings. The $3 glass of wine was a highlight of my most recent visit. The 911 and Haley rolls for $4 and $5 respectively are tasty and priced right during happy hour, but for some reason, I can never get full on them. The new happy hour is more focused on the sushi rolls. The non-sushi items are edamame, spicy chicken (fried), shishito peppers (very delicious) and gyoza. I am not sure I understand this change because with numerous AYCE late night options it seems that you could really stand out by discounting more of your non-sushi items. I admit that that is my unfounded, never-owned-a-restaurant assessment, and I am sure they have reasons for focusing on rolls.

The drive from the Stratosphere out to the restaurant wasn't too bad and we were rewarded with no wait and cheap prices. =) At first, we ordered an app and 2 rolls but, after finishing the second roll, we decided to spring for another one. 

+ Naked Crab: Pretty good, if you ask me. We loved that it was fried (not like your typical spring roll) and they weren't stingy on the portion. 
+ GTR: You can't go wrong with shrimp tempura AND spicy tuna. Each bite was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. 
+ Kamikaze: I'm not a fan of fresh water eel - it's always either too salty or topped with too much sauce, which is exactly the case here. However, the spicy tuna was powerful enough to make up for it. 
+ Deja Vu: So so good. Spicy salmon with salmon on top. PERFECT. Their Naked mayo was also particularly noteworthy.

I'm honestly more of a sashimi girl, but I'm also cautious and usually stick with rolls the first time I try out a new sushi place. If the rolls are delicious I move on to the sashimi on the next visit. 

Today's visit was the roll visit. I went during lunch time and was very pleased with the combos and options. For between $8.95 and $18.95 you can get 2-3 rolls, salad, and miso. I got 3 rolls for $14.95

Philadelphia - a staple of mine. Salmon was very fresh

Lisa/Lisa - Shrimp tempura, avocado, crunch, eel sauce. As delectable as it sounds. So sue me, it isn't Japanese at all! But damn it's some tasty Americanized goodness! 

Tuna - I got this one so I could make sure I tried one with just fish. The tuna was fresh and tasty. It seems like this place would have great sashimi. 

The place was cute, service was quick, and prices were great. I'm sorry I didn't try anything ""challenging"", but the rolls I tried were rolled perfectly, had fresh ingredients, and most importantly had PERFECT sushi rice .

It's gotten progressively busier the longer we've been going which is a positive things for business but a negative one for wait time when they are packed. The servers always remember us tho and know our preferences before we ever say a word.

I always go here for the happy hour, usually around midnight. It's not AYCE sushi but I prefer it that way.   I don't like AYCE places because, although they work for some, I never eat enough for it to be worth it. This is a great place for a sushi fan that wants to take time to savor  their favorite rolls, give a new roll a chance and sit back and relax with companions.  I also like the happy hour menu. It recently changed and I'm not sure if I like the new or old menu better. The old menu had everything I wanted and while the new one boasts more variety, the prices are a little different an what I want comes out to a dollar or two more. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for a few new experiences tho.
I usually order the Japanese lasagna and Philadelphia roll with no avocado on either (I'm allergic. It's tragic believe me). I also get a side of green bean tempura or Gyoza depending on my mood.  
Japanese Lasagna - I absofreakinlutely LOVE this roll. I can't get enough of it. It's just so flavorful it's a mouthgasm. The cream cheese on too just gives the entire ensemble an extra flair.
The Philadelphia roll is a tried and true classic that I can't get enough of. The fish is always so fresh and delicious.
The green bean tempura is something that I always crave. It's just amazing. The green beans are crisp and have the perfect little snap when you bite into them. 
I've tried a variety of other rolls and I really enjoy the Naked Girl as well as the Haley roll. I've definitely found. A few items I love and I've  stuck with them but I know that when I'm ready to branch out all of my options are delicious.
I recently tried the Lobster roll and I have to say that it was amazing. I'm not usually a lobster fan but I'll make exceptions for this roll. It was delicious.
Overall I love this spot and they take their time to make you a part of the family. Over time they remember your name and face and get into a habit of reading you by your previous preferences.

To begin, the atmosphere is comfortable, very welcoming and just delightful. If you are so lucky to be served on by Wanda, you came up - and you should feel grateful. There is not a chance you would ever be served something that wasn't fresh. The quality of their fish is better than any I've had, ever - and I know myself and my family to be a sushi snobs 100%.

When my family goes to NF's, we don't even place an order - which is unusual for a group of food-obsessed individuals - but rather, Wanda does everything. She definitely knows what we like, but will always bring out whatever is the freshest and any fun specials. Another special thing about this place is that they serve chawanmushi! And it's fantastic and delicious every single time. They will make whatever type of roll you want to complete your experience - I believe my Dad combined two of them and now that's one of our staples. However, the rolls are inventive and truly on point, you don't need to get creative, the sushi chefs take care of that.

Most recently, Naked Fish's was kind enough to cater a special dinner at our home and words cannot express how special and tasty everything was. They literally brought the restaurant to our house, complete with a giant sushi boat they constructed. Everything was on point per usual and that will go down in history as one of the best nights of my life. We had about 20 people and every single one - even those who don't eat fish - couldn't stop singing NF's praises.

People should understand that not only are you getting extremely good quality eats when you're dining at NF, but also, you're undoubtedly partaking in a wonderful experience because their staff is truly spectacular. Clearly, the chefs and cooks know what they are doing. Yet anyone from the hostess, to Wanda (and other servers), to the owner of the restaurant are truly wonderful people who want you to enjoy the gift they are bestowing upon you. 

Do yourself a favor and get over to Naked Fish's! It almost pains me to share this with the public because I want to keep that place for myself- but they deserve all the praise!",dE-ieA2wIPEtcl6HJJZu6Q,2,0,5,tAnKGre8dHW9Vz2UqWQqbA

By Jessica M.

Naked Sushi, you complete me. Our love affair begin in March for my BFFs birthday. We got there at 10PM (when Happy Hour starts). We order a bunch of different apps that were so reasonably priced. I'll admit, I was nervous with the prices, but Naked Fish, you did not disappoint.

There are several rolls on their Happy Hour menu, some as cheap as $3! Re-DONK-ulous and the most expensive is around $7. Not. Shabby. At. All. 

The restuarant is small, dimly lit, and intimate. (Last I checked there was a breif close for remodeling)

The sushi chefs are willing to accomidate any request. I've even created rolls all of my own and they have accomidated.

The green tea isn't that great, they use matcha powder, similar to what we used for green tea frappuccinos at Starbucks.

This place hits the spot after a night of drinking and dancing. They are open until 2 AM. And they are just as friendly and accomidating to guests at 1 AM as they are at 7 PM.

All in all, Naked Fish, is the business. Definitely check it out if you are in the neighborhood. It's yum to the yum yum yummy!",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,6,6,5,MUZm77Ct2aBJW862z1_0cw

Although I rarely have food from the regular dinner menu myself, I've seen plenty of others having it and the place gets pretty busy plenty of nights so you definitely want to reserve for any party over four people.

While I'm a bit disappointed that you have remained closed for lunch, I still have yet to be disappointed by your food or service.  This is an update, so make sure to read my original review for the recommendations, which I stand by to this day.

The live ama ebi (sweet shrimp) is quite an experience if you haven't tried it.  They bring the little guy out and introduce you to him so he can wave good bye, then they bring him out with the tail raw and nigiri style, and the head deep fried.  Sometimes people don't know how to handle that-- you just eat the whole thing.  Trust me.  It's been fried, so it'll be crunchy goodness all the way through.

Their specials rotate, so just check for what's on the chalk board, or ask your waiter.  They're always more than happy to let you know.

I'm not a big fan of uni, but after taking a friend there, he had apparently been searching for a sushi restaurant that served uni, unsuccessfully, for like the last three years.  NF not only has uni, but you get your choice of regular uni, or special uni which has been cleaned and shipped from Japan in salt water to preserve its freshness.  Wanda recommended not to add anymore soy sauce as it would already be salty because of that.  Buddy looked like he had died and gone to heaven.",b8VLOP2Juoqen4ySh0-JOw,2,1,5,3bhsJz7zRO5fOYc0L5UOvw

Went here on a recommendation by a dealer at Paris, I consider myself a bit of a foodie and do a lot of research before heading to a restaurant and I figure since she is a local I'd taker her recommendation. 

1. I was a little bummed it wasn't all you can eat, even tho the dealer who recommended it told me it was. 

2. Okay everything is alcarte so I was expecting amazing fresh quality fish, was not impressed. Had a ropangi roll recommended by the waitress, the fish was a little fishy for tuna even tho it was masked by ton of vinaigrette sauce. 

3. tried the banzai roll that was deep fried boy was that a mistake, fillet o-fish  would have tasted better.

4. Had an eel roll, spicy scallop (way to sweet they put a sweet spicy sauce not in a good way) and a shrimp tempura roll, the eel and shrimp tempura roll was ehh nothing outstanding. 

5. had a gyoza on the side cant go wrong with some fried dumplings, I think that was the best thing I had.


I didn't try any nigiri because I would have ended spending over $100 if I did by myself. Now I had 5 rolls that was basic and was on the cheaper side and happy hour prices. I couldn't believe my bill was $70 after tip for myself.

I don't mind paying for good food but it was mediocre for what I payed.
Maybe I'm missing something because this place has 4 stars on yelp. I was very disappointed by their roll selection everything included imitation crab meat which is junk. For the price I payed they should use real crab meat. 

I would have only payed $30 bucks for an all you can eat sushi bar in Vegas and the quality is better. Like goyemon or sin city sushi. I felt raped after paying $70 for crappy rolls. If the rolls and fish was much better quality no problem but it was crap or mediocre. 

plus as a added bonus I got food poisoning what a great gift getting to go to the bathroom several times

To begin with, I found it a little odd that it was very easy to get reservations on a Saturday night where it is usually difficult to do that. Still, the seaweed salad was delicious as was the vegetable tempura. We ordered sashimi salmon with lemon and ponzu sauce and it was just OK. I kept being told how tasty it would be but it fell a little flat to me and it was missing acidity. My favorite roll is yellowtail with scallion. I ordered that and I was very disappointed because it was 'mashed' yellowtail with scallion through it and it must have been salted 'or something' because the actual role was very salty without any soy sauce on it. Not good! I explained that what it is is a piece of yellow tail with a little bit scallion on top rolled. Any sushi chef knows exactly what you're talking about so I am not sure what they understood but I clearly said a yellowtail with scallion roll and what I got was not all that appetizing.
My friend got the shrimp tempura roll which did look good and was good. She also got the Philly roll which  she likes and I do not care for but she said it was good. She also got a California roll that she said was good. Overall, it only gets three stars from me and is only average for me. I would not rush to go back with the experience I had last night.

As far as the menu. For me it ticks all the boxes! Its fresh and good! It has all your traditional rolls and then it has its customs! For me, its a must try, even after all this time!",hlVWGy_t796fbk_iETH5kA,1,1,4,r8VP4TD9yt3aBveevgNbMA

 review about dinner to follow

So I had dinner and overall it was pretty good.The busser was on top of my tea refills. The grilled sea bass was good, well cooked and right amount of sauce. The red snapper special sashimi was pretty fresh. And the toro tuna special a bit too thick and overwhelmingly fat. 
THe only downside is when the check arrived. That toro tuna was $37.50!!!! 
I think they should tell the customer whenever a special (5pc) is over $18!!!
Damn!
I'd go back but not for the specials

Go to Naked Fish's between the hours of 10PM to 2AM.They have a happy hour during that time and it can't be beaten... Hands down the best place to go in LV ... you really get what you pay for... 

I've had every roll on their happy hour menu... it's cheap ($2 for sapparo or sake), delicious (kamikaze and lasagna roll are yum) and the service is great.  But the best thing hands down is the sea bass... now this isn't on their happy hour menu, but it's 100% worth it. It's a nice large piece of fish, marinated in a miso base... it's tender, juicy and melts in your mouth like butter. It's awesome.

It's about 7 miles west of the strip off Flamingo and Durango but it's totally worth the trek out there.

But, this time was worse than the first time I tried it.  Most of all, the quality of their fish is marginal.  They weren't fresh (hamachi was dry and most all other fish lacked any kind of flavor or taste of freshness) and their rice isn't cooked or prepared right.  Secondly, their fish and rice portions are very small.  You really don't get much for the price you pay for.  In fact, my sushi slices were cut so thin and small that I could hardly taste the flesh of the fish.  The makis...their sauces contain too much sugar.  And again, very small potions. 

Their green tea has no flavor either.  It's green in color, that's about it.  I spent $53 for 4 orders of sushi, one spicy salmon roll, and fresh shrimp (the head was fried but was too greasy to eat).  The place isn't good and it is relatively expensive.  I don't mind paying for good food.  Sasabune of Los Angeles is my favorite sushi place  They do everything right and use the freshest high quality fish.  And they do their rice right.

Another thing would be that food comes out pretty slow. Even when they're not busy food comes out slow so forget about it on weekend nights. Order all of your sushi quickly and tell the waitress to bring what ever is ready or else you have to wait until they cut up everything and that takes even longer. 

Besides that the sushi is very high quality and they give you nice thick slices of fish. Never had any complaints about the sushi.

I ordered uni from Santa Barbara. I like my uni sweet, and Santa Barbara delivers. Every time.

We shared a spicy pucker roll just to fill us.

And this is where we failed: we ordered more.

Two more pieces of Santa Barbara uni, and a burning spider roll. The roll was a bit sour, but that was probably because there were thin slices of lemon on each piece.

It was hyped by him, to say the least, and we were celebrating so we decided to go all out. Here's what we got and my review of each:

1. House Sake: $3 happy hour sake? Yes. Please. I know next to nothing about sake but it tasted good to me and was served warm.

2. Jalapeno Yellowtail: delightful appetizer, very spicy and flavorful. The sauce the yellowtail floats in is very good.

3. Fosizzle My Nizzle: basically a Japanese jalapeno popper. Absolutely delightful. I highly recommend this one.

4. Zero Tiger: the most simple roll we got with tempura shrimp, avocado, and spicy mayo. Their spicy mayo is amazing.

5. GTR: My second favorite roll we got. This one has been hit with a blow torch for a charred taste. Spicy, savory, amazing. Highly recommend.

6. Miso Sea Bass: favorite dish of the night. Hands down the best fish I've had in my life. Run, don't walk, to this amazing dish. You won't regret it.

7. Roppongi: my boyfriend originally had this on his list and then forgot when he ordered. The waitress recommended it at the end and he realized that was what he forgot. My favorite roll of the night, plus you can take a moment from your fine dining experience to giggle at the consistency and color of the sauce on it (you'll see).

8. Green Tea Mochi: what's better than delicious matcha ice cream and mochi at the end of your meal? Nothing. That's what.

All of this came out to less than $80 for 2 people to absolutely feast on a 7-dish meal plus sake. Service was impeccable. Atmosphere is super casual and pleasant.

I recently went to check out their food during their late night Happy Hour (starts at 10pm until they close). And when I arrived just after 10 pm on a Wednesday night, the restaurant was at packed.  The wait was estimated at 5 minutes for the sushi bar, in reality it was actually longer, but I thought it was worth it.

Lobster Roll is the feature HH roll of the week, so I gave that a try, along with Tiger Roll, 911 Roll, and Garlic JP Lasagna Roll.  The Lobster Roll was a little disappointing for me, as what I had imagined from reading the description and the actual roll that was served was not the same. I was thinking fresh lobster, but all the lobster are tempura fried.  The Tiger Roll and 911 Roll are my two favorite, and if I really have to be picky, I would say that the chefs may go a little crazy saucing the plate with eel sauce.  The Garlic JP Lasagna Roll was good, and was not served drowning in broiled mayo like at some lesser sushi restaurants in town.

Service was good, and I didn't have to ask for refills in spite of how busy the restaurant was.

Anyway, Naked Fish is recommended overall as a restaurant.  As far as their HH menu, it is basically $2 off their selection of rolls, so if you want nigiri as part of the HH discount, there are other places to try if that is a deal breaker.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,3,-Lol9wVmds85DOd45SC8uA

This place is awesome! It's a pretty small restaurant. We got here around 5pm on a Friday and we were seated right away. By the time we left at 6pm, the place was full and there were a few parties waiting in line for a table.

They had many sushi dishes to choose from. I liked how they had a full picture menu for the sushi so you can see what it looks like. Then I thought, hey this place is called Naked Fish, so why not try the fish? So I ordered the Salmon Miso Yaki Meal and my husband ordered this Conch dish that our server had told us about - it was the special of the day and supposedly very good. A few minutes later our server came back to me and said that the salmon wasn't available. So she suggested that I get the Grilled Sea Bass Miso Butter Meal instead. I do like Miso Black Cod, and she said it was similar to that. I was kind of hesitant at first. I mean, it was $27.95, and I wasn't planning to order anything expensive. But then I thought, what the hell, I just had a bad week and I'm relaxing in Vegas for the weekend, so why not? Well, she was right, it was great! Good flavor, the fish was easy to eat, and I like how it came with an extra cup of miso on the side. Nice presentation of our two dishes as well, the food looked very pretty!

Not sure what our server's name was. The receipt said Wanda, but the sushi chefs where calling her ""Nikki-san."" Well, whoever she was, she was great! Very nice and friendly and did a good job checking up on us from time to time even though it was busy. The other servers also stopped by our table to ask how the food was.

We also ordered edamame which is my favorite, but I was quite disappointed here, they tasted stale :O(

For the main course we had Chicken Katsu (white meat), if you haven't had Katsu you haven't lived! Its lightly fried chicken breast served with cabbage, rice and the oh so delicious Katsu sauce. 

The Completely Naked roll (don't quote me on name) was recommended to us by our lively server Wanda as a signature dish. It had spicy kick to it, that kept you wanting more.

As far as the food goes food was ok..I've definitely had better...let's just say it wasn't worth the wait. If the food came out efficiently I would've given a higher rating. But I've never experienced this before at any sushi restaurant. Which is mostly what I frequent when dining out.",AL_AxpW0cbERv4cpAXeqFw,3,0,1,5_tMRRCTmIBFkeWWTFr7Iw

The staff is always welcoming, and they take very good care of us. The fish is fresh and you can't beat their happy hour prices! Definitely recommend!",BIRtLK0xeqpsmwt5tXaX-Q,0,0,5,qvldX4XONO7JDRugDvwOFA
5954468,2016-09-15,8,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"Naked Fish is a hidden gem.  It is tucked away in a small shopping center on Durango, a bit off Flamingo.  It is also not going to show up on your Yelp, if you just search for sushi in the surrounding area, but be aware that it is there!  They have the coolest chefs Ryu and Kai who seem to always be there when we eat there. The fish here is the freshest I have ever seen.  Naked Fish is always busy with regulars.  My favorite special rolls here is the Sunset and the Sun Devil.  Those are available for the happy hour.  The Chef Special rolls are to die for!  My three favorites are the Angry Wifes, Burning Spider, and Crabacore. The service is always great here. They definitely remember regulars.  Although they do not offer all you can eat sushi, the quality is definitely worth more than the quantity!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,21,17,5,r3JVQ3PI_f9UzyzLsk3BTg

I was just driving by I saw that it was open late, (actually till 2) came in and everything to my surprise was good.  I'm just saying you wouldn't expect it in a strip mall 5 miles off the strip.",voUZKnjYe8wi4UNDX8jlAQ,0,0,5,55J6tbGxWbimGi-2u-4weA
5985448,2017-02-18,3,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"Okay so I normally like this place, food is usually good and their HH is great. Service on the other hand is awful. We walked in on a Friday evening,my bf was finishing up his Red Bull and the hostess (rude short lady with a mullet) told him he couldn't come in until he finished his Red Bull- WTH?? She then asks us if we have a reservation...Mind you, the restaurant is empty (maybe 3 other parties). She proceeds to seat us at the smallest table they have.- ordered 4 dishes, 2 beers and it barely fit, very UNCOMFORTABLE.

We were there for an hour, and all the tables/booths were never occupied, which they claimed to be ""reserved"". Anyways, looks like we'll be going back to sushi fever where the staff is always pleasant and courteous :).",9nFf9SoGBA_fsxYzF71JhQ,3,1,1,_Owp8cjqFMYraPoOj06Wag
5988404,2018-03-23,0,yHYjDPuRtLvhvMpOn5fXOQ,"The reason for the three stars  is because the food is okay. However they do NOT honor their word. They have a sign stating if you review on yelp you get a FREE SASHIMI A or TEMPURA and if you check in on yelp you get a FREE JALAPEÑO YELLOWTAIL (4pcs) or EDAMAME. My partner checked in and showed the waiter. He saw it and said that he'd make sure we got it. All of our food came out perfect. Then we got to the bill. They had the edamame on there as a charge. My partner spoke to the waitress and notified her that the edamame was supposed to be free. She said oh yes. Then the waiter (we were being served by two people), brought back our card and the bill and we had been charged for the edamame. My partner said something to him and he brought the manager over. Unfortunately, they would have had to charge me again and I would have had to wait for the money to go back. I understand that. I'm just completely disappointed that I mentioned it several times and still was charged.",RlGa7lOZX_gBM163Ye5K6Q,1,0,3,rpUxPLK5aM6ceIX17fijSw
