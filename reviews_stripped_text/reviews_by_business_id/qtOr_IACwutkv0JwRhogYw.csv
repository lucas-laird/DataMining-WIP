There's a cute cocktail lounge in the front of the show room where you can sit and have a few drinks before and after the show.",tVZ4TWEs8N9kNeD81V1_PQ,0,0,4,k-eF2yZfPkcfBYOmaX7wbw
3719334,2016-05-05,1,qtOr_IACwutkv0JwRhogYw,This steak house is inside of silver seven hotel casino. Smallest steak house I have ever been to. I think they only got 10 tables. Staffs are very nice. Not much ambiance.  Free bread was good.  I ordered salmon dinner plate. Salmon had no flavor it was OK i tuink it need little salt but very fresh. . The asparagus was very good. Cooked perfect.  Overall foods were very fresh and very hot.  Meaning my server didn't messed around.  She brought it right off the grill. Well I had good dinner at reasonable price and good service. I am a happy customer,AsYBFmnMZMm9FOJi6o0seA,1,1,4,KshzeKJnrFfyZZ3Entk7dQ

My husband and I split the asparagus side...again, cooked perfectly. He enjoyed the rib-eye....grilled med rare and so juicy & flavorful. Our crew was Cheryl, Remy and Jerry....we were so blessed! They truly made it a memorable meal. My husband enjoyed the Ribeye...cooked to med rare perfection! Sipped the Zin Your Face...highly recommended!! 
There are so MANY places in Vegas to get a decent meal for a really reasonable price, but this place is one of the hidden best. And if you stay a night in the hotel, the tropical pool area takes you to a whole other place, far away from the buzz of the strip. What a wonderful getaway.... will be back!",_zEnfwyYBdwIGU45A4KnCw,0,0,4,5pvM2woPa5XFmELRZgpCWw

Once inside there is a second bar. I would say the show seats around 80 people. Booths in back. Seats surround the stage. The seats (folding chairs) are not comfortable. The seats are the only thing I don't like about the experience. 
I would recommend this showroom. I will be back!",ACMYTmlycF2-HgSZ8lyC0A,0,1,4,pYwnuWqIpMez4jAozNZT0Q
