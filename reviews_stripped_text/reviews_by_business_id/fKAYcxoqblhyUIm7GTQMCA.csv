Their french toast is also special -- they use sourdough bread, light egg covering, and sprinkle powdered sugar on it. This is what french toast should actually be. Well it is what it should be in the Southwest United States according to wikipedia, but that's where I am from so take it! 

They also have fresh orange juice, great prices, and very friendly service. Be careful to go on Sundays around 9-10 because there's a church up the street where nearly everyone attends Original after.",BMEmpeosi4LfwRlAMgtjbg,0,0,5,V1p_IqVsO9MX2qOLKJTDSA

Nothing to WOW about.
Although their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell.
There is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.

Party of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer.
Great service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart.
Especially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.

Tuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table.
Once seated I'm surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY.
All the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I'm finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.

Food is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.

Will I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a ""morning after"" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.

Give me the Mom & Pop breakfast joint any ol' time versus a place like this or similar.

But, your mileage may vary. I don't even want to think about a Sunday!",xRh1hiVs92563tupN662zg,2,2,2,SbUsDBO4Yh9Yjb1Poa0YlQ
1512336,2009-01-15,1,fKAYcxoqblhyUIm7GTQMCA,"Yum. We love this place. It's exactly like the one in Royal Oak MI... I guess I never knew it was a chain! The omelets are awesome!! They are absolutely huge, you could probably split it with someone if you wanted. It nice and fluffy (I think because they bake it?) I recommend the veggie one, very good !

The bulgar wheat pancakes rock! I know what your thinking.....but I swear they kick ass and they are good for you (kind of ;)) This place totally owns IHOP! You have to check it out!

Can't wait to try the french toast you are all raving about. I love the omelets so much I have a hard time trying anything else!",XrlYaTPoZTpi-iluryFNcg,1,1,4,g8Hzovi3-ewWZGNDvnupTQ
2648870,2008-10-12,4,fKAYcxoqblhyUIm7GTQMCA,"I ask you what would you do when you go and pick your red Ferrari up? What is the first thing you do in that car? Put the top down, turn the bass up, light your cigarrette, and what? Go to the Original Pancake House (OPH as me and my Vegas crew call it). That's what I do. And I'm not playing. 

I'm driving on the freeway with one thing in mind. My challah french toast. I want my front parking spot, why I don't know because none of the spots there are in the shade at all, and want my breakfast. Thick slices of beautiful challah, dipped and cooked up all perfect with some strawberries. Oh, my strawberries, yes please. Extra please. Throw down some coffee with that, a little O.J. ya'll and watch your fingers. If you get too close to my toast you're gonna lose a hand. I'll even take an extra order to go knowing that they don't do takeout orders. That way I know I'll be totally taken care of in three hours, when my sugar high has crashed and I know I want more. I've even had my french toast with a glass of Chateau D'Yquem. That's sick. And it was delicious.

The service is fast, they have conveniently located restaurants. They close early, I think about 2:30 pm, so get your hungover asses outta bed and get some breakfast. It's a whole hell of a lot better than that IHOP shit they're always trying to feed us. I know it's not Waffle House guys, but that's a whole different story.",lOMM7HTHhabi1qofd-w7zw,4,4,5,P8lD6Ew45h2dxQlY0tVGhg

The dutch baby (which my mom always orders) does take 20 minutes, so if someone else orders it, you might be in for a bit of a wait.",HQtXIf4bJ7nhYyM0utZUuA,0,0,5,0FfcwkDHmYWNxg4cT-l0dQ
3912429,2007-01-24,0,fKAYcxoqblhyUIm7GTQMCA,"Awesome!  I love potato pancakes.  They are excellent here.  When we visited here, among other things, we got the Bacon Lover's Special.  We must have gotten half a pound of bacon!  We ended up sharing with the ""older"" couple next to us, who commented on how much bacon came to the table.  

Mostly locals at this joint, since it's way off the strip.

My 'original' favorite was the OPH at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson  (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?hrid=JAjv8kjm89V08MGTqmb97Q ) but the lines are insane there and it' doesn't make much sense to drive all the way out there when my family is near Summerlin.  Thank goodness theres an excellent OPH in this part of town.",ASvjSBCYRd4GhOtSIn8Gyw,0,0,4,T_hHcEAuRJE_LNRfzEVWpQ

5697693,2008-07-21,0,fKAYcxoqblhyUIm7GTQMCA,I love coming to this place on the weekends besides the fact that it is jam packed with people so on the weekend get up at about 7 am to get a decent spot. The FRENCH TOAST is sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.YUM!,tcUYEM_AwVaMyZvX5z3UmA,0,0,5,rDV0v2ws9mOokc3Ibt5muw
