No matter what you order off the main menu you will be happy.  But be sure to order the meatballs as an appetizer, or you will be sorry. Truly the best.",QAa9qMjpQqmw8gvNCa_lUA,0,0,5,uk0ViWWeaEDW3qp18eCBEw

My wife and a friend had the salmon special, I had the Penne alla Pasquale's with shrimp and another had the Ravioli d;Aragosta. All were excellent. The chimichurri sauce they serve with bread is simply outstanding. This place is off the beaten path but certainly worth the trip. You won't be disappointed.",R-PidHWPv4hp0EhgP053Rg,1,0,5,aVoMbCoehyd7OIXpt8cmRQ

It's been a very long time since I had such poor service in any restaurant!  Our appetizers arrived (not quickly, mind you), before our server took our order for our main dishes.  The server spilled the water as she poured it more than one time.  She didn't know the menu items, and couldn't recommend anything.  I have to say that she did admit she was new.  You'd think they'd have people bus tables for a while before allowing them to represent the restaurant as servers.  The service aside, our meal was so so.  My first visit here was a few weeks ago when some old customers took me.  The food and service were both good then.  This time, three of us ordered the Parmesan Chicken, and it was good.  My wife had a pasta dish with clams and she said she didn't enjoy it.  All said, there are too many restaurants in Las Vegas to return to one with poor service.",SNJNWgbxlg6a3JJiO4vMhA,1,0,3,GAsutM5sfG_MrMZFjick4w

Calamari avellino - It was meh, should have ordered it with the spicey tomato sauce not the white wine sauce.  The calamari was a bit tough.

Funghi Selvatici Risotto -  Although the risotto was a bit too tight, but it was creamy, had a good mushroom flavor, and the rice grains had a slight bite to them.

Pollo Marsala with a side of spaghetti pomodoro - The Marasala sauce was a bit too sweet.  The pomodoro sauce was very good.  It was a nice balance of acid and sweetness.  The pasta also had a good chew to it.  

Side order of Sauteed rapini - It is a vegetable so I can feel better about myself.

I again sufficiently satisfied my tastebuds and would recommend and definitely want to come here again.",8HSPqescPcwOmQ6sQ3-TTg,3,0,4,wNDhi9r9-_9a6oW-azlNSQ

Easy access from Sahara Avenue and plenty of parking.  Desserts are a little weak, but that is easily remedied.  Give this place a try.  You will like it.",9OIA9xTOuZ48zedtduLzbQ,0,0,4,OA3mmVkeY1EsvKmzdWN2gQ

Had the $6 mista salad, the $12 appetizer sampler and the $22 sole entree.  Absolutely awesome meal and what an excellent value!  The sole will just melt in your mouth.  And I highly recommend the sampler platter - everything was super fresh and delicious.  Service was again top notch.  I would give this place another star if I could.",NmygL6zSMEvDM3Y9dS5cyw,3,0,5,ixdtqRbdwH-lccSM8-Eptg

I was holding a sales dinner meeting for a group of doctors in Vegas and when then people at the other venue cancelled on me the day before Bo and his staff worked hard and fit us in last minute. Saved my butt and I can't thank them enough. This will be my new favorite hang when I'm in town. Oh and the meatballs are ridiculously good.",oIg6p6WmftsnWmbduKi4vw,0,0,5,zJcoQZ32kfTfifWGnhAUyQ
