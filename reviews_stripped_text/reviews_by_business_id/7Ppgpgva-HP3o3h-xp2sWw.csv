Chaos between female hispanic manager and irate drive up customer who had come in to get his order corrected, stopped ALL orders from being served. Customer service on manager's part was HORRIBLE!! While all customers waited near counter for their orders, she engaged in foul language and shouting with angry customer. A young, black female with freckles on her face saw nothing was being done and jumped in and started asking each waiting customer what their order was and SHE got the orders together and people served. This young lady deserves a reward for being in control when the manager WAS NOT!!! Every time I come to this location, the wait time is longer than other McDonalds and the older women who work the counter are REALLY slow and seem to have problems with english. I am done with giving this McDs anymore chances for my business. They just cannot seem to get it together.",zv9t_T_xo1MIzuAtoPOyug,0,0,1,yEztd3q406vW0UG8S6ZmnQ

Burger King should open 24 hours next door they would make a killing. Being in the service industry, when the system went down it was called doing everything manually.",_iXTEBUW0XX3Km_1_fWeUA,0,0,1,CVYyntMagabhsN2uJnCCsQ
1679278,2017-03-20,3,7Ppgpgva-HP3o3h-xp2sWw,Another horrible experience as I sit here at the number 2 pick up window for our food. I quit coming here because of another bad experience but only because it's convenient and close to my house and I thought I can get my kids to school on a timely manner boy was I wrong. Here I am sitting in the window waiting for 3 McGriddles I have been in the drive thru for about 15 minutes and sitting at the number 2 pick up window for another 10. I'm extremely annoyed I already paid for my food if I wouldn't have put it on my credit card I would for just canceled my order. Now because of this my children are late for school thanks a lot McDonald's for your poor service and rude employees,xKz_xyc2KThHnqq8m4NMXg,0,0,1,eD-gShYh3ybnRBk0EDwl-g

Bullshit. How come they always make the mistake if their favor. I have Never been given anything extra that I Didn't order. Rip-off,XUo7OGXLDBtqHEinDWeP4A,0,0,1,hRjsVOT5b0UuMVBXlLuFyw

3271789,2018-04-27,0,7Ppgpgva-HP3o3h-xp2sWw,This place is the most unprofessional and ignorant fast food place I have ever came to. The people are so rude as I'm standing there waiting for my two items at least three or four different drive-through customers came in and reported problems. The worker is basically ignore people and don't even provide them with what they order. I ordered a medium McAfee and barely half of the cup was filled. It's a disgrace disrespectful and inconsiderate of the workers to be going on strike demanding more money but yet treat their customers like crap and can't even get an order right. I was also here earlier in the day and ordered for hashbrowns and for sausage burritos only to receive poor called burritos and for hot hashbrowns. This place is an absolute disgrace to the McDonald's name,eiW_IAgr9a3YLxzEoqhyrw,0,0,1,9KWCngDUM6fcoj0TFLQI9A
4206491,2018-02-11,0,7Ppgpgva-HP3o3h-xp2sWw,"I last paid a visit to this McDonalds about a month ago and ordered breakfast. Everything was fine except they did not provide butter with my breakfast biscuit?, so I went back to line and waited until they asked what I needed... about 5 minutes. I went back to my table, then opened my bottle of milk... and as soon as I started to drink it, realized it was sour. Turns out it had an expiration date of 3 days previous. I went back up and had to wait again until they finally asked what I needed. They replaced the milk without an apology. Yesterday I was there again and had the same breakfast... but this time, though we were the ONLY people in line, the salesperson took us to a kiosk and said she was forced by her manager to use the machine instead of the register because they have to justify the use of the machines. We also had to pay for our meals using this ridiculous kiosk. What happened to customer service? How foolish is this logic? This will be the LAST time I come to this crazy location.",yhjwkclgQoWMqxISoVQy_Q,0,0,1,c5jT8_1_3qWvSEqIOJQkNA
4209319,2015-10-13,1,7Ppgpgva-HP3o3h-xp2sWw,"It's McDonald's. Are you freaking kidding me?  This is a welcomed business to that particular spot. I have lived in the area since it was the Original Pancake House. Afterwards there weren't any businesses that survived until this beautiful place opened. I would like to give 5 stars.  However, I too have had awful service. Their fish filet was made like a teaching sandwich.(I thought the workers went to Ronald McDonald college). Half  a slice of cheese with a hard piece of over-cooked fish and a bun with a speckle of a secret sauce. Too late to turn around but not too late to leave a review.

I wouldn't take my eyes off customer service for a minute.  On another occasion a bought chicken nuggets and the young lady asked what type of sauce and I asked for hot mustard. She gave me 6 French mustard that you put on a hot dog. Not the one you dip a chicken nugget in. 

Small complaints add up. Watch you staff. On the first week upon opening. There were coupons and a big fanfare. Now it's just take the money and run.",Q7Pkf7GtXtplV41c8xwPxQ,1,1,2,EshR6awF438Ss57YrNfzKg

First of all you are showing people how to use a machine that is potentially going to take your job. Try concentrating on bringing back good ol customer service. I'm not a fan of replacing jobs with these machines it shows greed by the higher ups as if you don't make enough stinking money as it is.",zKuz2Aj6DrXOATpEf2N7SA,0,0,3,GrL8QPPHkKHgva3GhJDkEg

5021150,2016-01-19,3,7Ppgpgva-HP3o3h-xp2sWw,Surprised my the bad reviews. This location is walking distance to my house so on nights that cooking is not an option I find myself here. Food is always fresh and as good as any of the other locations I've been to. The thing that makes this location stand out are the people that work here are actually really nice! McDonald's is McDonald's. Not the healthiest and u always hate yourself for eating it but at least the people here are friendly,fxrQSMhHlBv6eJVRdchG9Q,4,3,4,fEplMHdZ7YFRXFnKy4SBbA
5186970,2018-01-09,0,7Ppgpgva-HP3o3h-xp2sWw,"An item was missing from my order, and I didn't realize until I got back home. I called the store, and the manager said I'd have to drive back to the store to either pick up the item or be refunded, which wasn't a convenient option for me. 

I understand that mistakes happen, but customers shouldn't have to pay for the mistakes of employees. The store was able to charge me when I pre-ordered through the app, so they should be able to refund me (or adjust the charge) the same way. Or they could have offered to pay the fee for Uber Eats to have my missing food delivered. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get what I paid for.

UPDATE: After 9 days, the ""Customer Service Manager"" finally sent me a canned response stating that ""the crew is trained to double-check orders"" and that they ""will be certain to follow up with them"" but offered NO resolution... no refund of the item I was charged for but didn't receive, no coupon, nothing.",G2pkSw1nhmdemLm3VNrbCA,0,0,1,JZizjVm2Hz-dpKHVYCYbGw
