46540,2017-11-25,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,I have gone to this theater several times. First thing I hate is the ticket price almost triple the price of anyone else.  then your down town in a bad neighborhood. Ok well the inside is nice until you get to the food and drinks part every single time I go early or late it literally takes 30 to 40 minutes to get food do the math if an average movie is 1 1/2 long that's half way through the movie you might get your over priced food and the bottomless drinks and have to try and eat them in the pitch black dark. I do love the commercials while you are there about there new menu would be great if you could actually get food my wife keeps dragging me out here and every time it is more and more disappointing. I'm done spending a hundred dollars between movie drinks and food and getting worse food service then McDonald's who I don't have to tip. Bottom line not worth the hype or the time to go absolutely disappointed every sing time will not go any more.,_P6Law-9HnhQ06BMne28ag,0,0,1,Ne0Cy6ZUcXoFNLDT6-qcwA

Upon being sat, we were greeted by our server Alexandria, who was very attentive. Brought us out drinks and fresh popcorn!

There's a bar too so you could grab drinks before, during,& after the movie! We ordered 2 alcoholic cocktails for $32 at the bar. Otherwise, your personal server will deliver everything to you during the movie. You have to give a card to swipe after you're done eating and drinking. The food was inexpensive. I recommend the chicken lollipops. We also had the fries that were just like any fries, nothing special. The Maine lobster rolls were small and ok. Our total food bill was $36. The seats were comfy and it was a smaller intimate theatre. It's obvious that the theatre targets adults. Sorry not kid friendly.

94788,2017-12-22,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"Went to see the new Star Wars on a weds night. 
Staff was nice, when they were there. Seats were big and comfy. Food is ok. Hot chocolate was really good. Nice upscale environment. I didn't know they had a parking lot, I would have parked there instead of on the street. 

We could have seen this movie for free had I known that no one cares if you have a ticket or not. They asked if we needed a tickets when we walked in, or had it we bought them on fandango. I said yes they are on my phone. They waved to go upstairs an no one ever asked to see our tickets. Ever. 
We sat in the lounge for about 15 min had some drinks. 
Then into the theater. 

They have a little button that lights up to call staff. 
They didn't come in to take orders till the trailers started and it was dark. Ok no biggie. After ordering they asked for my CC and then took it away with them. Out of the theater. I'm not big on that. Then they delivered drinks as the movie started. Not a great time to do that. The food arrived about 15 min later, during an exciting part of the movie. They forgot napkins. 
Every time they came in to wait on someone in the theater it was a distraction. 
Eventually that traffic slowed down and we were drawn into the movie. It looked great, sounded good in the theater. Not a lot of seats in each room. And the seats are paired. So it could be strange if you choose a seat next to someone you don't know. If you go alone or a group of friends. 
Finally they bring back my CC with the bill. During the end. So we miss some details. And this movie is all about the details. Also during the end this teenager in front of us, whips out his phone and starts texting. Then looking at picture of girls. Screen bright as daylight. I was gonna let him finish, but he just kept his phone out. So I pushed the back of his chair, and motioned towards the screen. He was clearly like ""What? What did I do? You got a problem?""  He put the phone away. I did not pay over 50 bux for three people to come here and look at his phone. But whatever. 
I think the idea of the theater is good. But the execution needs finesse. Order before the trailers. Get food and drinks to people before the movie starts. Get out and don't come back during the movie. 
Over all it was a bad part of town over priced and loads of distractions. 
I will not be returning. No need. Galaxy has theaters in better parts of town with better service and rules for no distractions. That and candy. The candy selection was weeeeek. Also no cherry slushees. Boo. Lol.",PnrAftMGWUeKg2gsTRQ2_g,0,0,2,Qg3N9v262JK_txaIxNrBvA

509218,2017-04-01,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,Theatre was nice and clean. Liked the fact it's 21 and over. The servers were really nice & polite. The seats were nice and cozy; however they don't recline back very far. Great for date night. Most of the seats are grouped for 2 which is nice and intimate. Only ordered the popcorn and soda. Didn't think to ask for extra butter as I usually do since I ordered in the theatre. Otherwise the popcorn was decent. They have a nice menu of other selections. Will definitively try on our next visit. It was nice that you could just push a button and server would come over when you needed so you didn't have miss any part of the movie. Before leaving we checked out the lounge area and bar which was also very nice. It was a fairly quite evening during our visit.,z9cnynWTZ2pZahz-gYjkkg,0,0,4,-y7yfGuaqA-1GYsyjTQpiQ
533446,2017-01-05,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"A poor excuse for a theater, especially one that claims to be ""luxury"".

We could hear the fan of the projector behind us throughout the entire movie. Granted, if we had been watching something louder, this may not have been as noticeable. But given the fact that it was a quiet drama, it became painfully obvious anytime there was a moment of silence onscreen. I'm guessing the walls in this theater are pretty thin, as we were also able to hear the bass rumbling from the theater next to us.

That was the most significant problem, and something I assume most moviegoers would want to consider before choosing this theater. The rest of my criticisms are more specific to technical presentation, service, and atmosphere. If those issues don't concern you as much- I'd suggest skipping the next three paragraphs and reading the final synopsis.

Their projector's white balance was off as well, giving the highlights a bluish tint. And even worse, the image was off center by about a foot, leaving part of the picture projecting onto the curtains to the right of the screen. Luckily, this framing mistake was only an issue during the trailers, since the movie itself was shot in a 1.66: 1 ratio.

The female server who was coming in and out of our theater bringing drinks was courteous and mindful of the audience. The two male servers that came in together, were not. They entered abruptly, stood in the middle of the theater (rather than to the side) while looking for the seats that had ordered, and then proceeded to rush up and down the stairs like no one was trying to watch a movie... What made it worse was that the steps to the left and right of us were over-lit, and it made even the slightest bit of activity in the audience more noticeable.

The rest of the staff was fine, but I was struggling to understand why there were so many of them. It was practically dead the night we went. The lounge upstairs was more like a club you'd find on the strip. Loud dance music and tons of TV's. Not the vibe you'd want when you're going to the cinema. As for the aesthetic of the place- grey walls with a few portraits of classic movie stars hung up for decoration. Pretty bland.

---------------------------

Overall, the evening was a basically a waste of money. It cost over $50 for two tickets (printed on receipt paper) and two beers. In terms of ""luxury"" theaters, Galaxy is still your best option. 

If you're just looking for a theater with no kids, I'd suggest Regal Village square. Or avoid going to a theater on their discounted ticketing days. I think for most in the valley it's either Tuesday or Wednesday now. If it's drinks you're after, most theaters are starting to do alcohol now anyway.

I'd have asked for a refund, but they fulfilled the basic need of playing the movie I paid to see.",_1LX9dNy5BzStj_bv6Bj5g,0,0,1,m1iZsLVe5pMI2h_Z4VWLnw

Place is looking good. Upscale. We go to the Bar/Lounge. Turn the damn lights up! Any dimmer and the lights will be off in the bar/lounge.

Now the warm soft pretzel bites were awesome. Then my wife had the pesto sliders which she said they were tasteless. OK so the food was awful. Now lets start the show.

I have never walked out of any movie let alone a Star Wars movie in my life but I wasn't going to let their horrible sound system wreck my Star Wars experience.

When we get there, even though we show proof, the girl at the front desk proceeds to say that there is no 10pm showing, and after being on her computer for 5 mins, gives us tickets for a 10:30 showing instead.
When we walk in the theater, there is a couple sitting in our seats. They told us that the manager sat them there, so we go back to the front and tell the security. He goes in and checks, then comes back out and says he'll get the manager. Mind you, the previews have begun already!
The manager Nick comes, and asks us for the tickets. He mentions something about Fandango messing up by double booking tickets. He went to go check on the seats, spending 10 mins going back and forth between the theater and the front desk. Finally, he comes to us and says that we were supposed to be in the 10pm... WE KNOW!!!

1071970,2017-09-24,2,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"It'll be a miracle if Eclipse lasts another year.  This theatre is so out of the area's price range it is simply ridiculous. $18 matinees?  Not even Summerlin 5 is that much.  
Plus my seat was broken here already.   More importantly, they put notes over the elevator discouraging people with disabilities from taking the elevator.  I was told it's been like this and there didn't appear to be immediate plans to fix.  

#1 complaint - No art house films and it's right in the thick of the arts district.  At least one screen should only play Films such as ""Beach Rats,"" ""Brad's Status,"" ""California Typewriter"" and so much more. Unfortunately they just play the latest popcorn film over and over every hour.  

#2 complaint - Expensive as Heck - Soda is poured in a small cocktail glass and you still pay movie theatre pricing.  Food is average for $13-18 entrees.  Draft Beer starts at $8.  Most are more.  

#3 complaint - unfinished modern look only will go so far.  Signage is very poor.  Can't find most basic things without help.  It feels like a gym without the equipment.  The railings next to most seats are lit so much you can't have a dark theatre to watch their wide (sarcasm) selection of 2-4 films.  

Only art house / indie films (and there are tons not played at Regal Village or Suncoast) added would make me come back.  And I'm their target audience.  I want them to succeed but this is sad how underutilized these theatres are used.   Even classic film days or nights would help make this place like an Alamo, the gold standard for this type of theatre. Please read this Eclipse / we need art and commerce.  

In closing?  The Bottomless Mimosa campaign at early weekend shows.  You've got to be kidding.  I'm all for all day inebriation if you wanna but server comes from bar and has to bring every 15 minutes a new refill to the patron next to me.  Can we say interruptions galore?

1078992,2017-12-22,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"I love film, but like most cinephiles these days I don't get to the movie theater as often as I once did. I prefer to wait for video or streaming. Most cinemas have little to offer beyond inconsiderate audiences, texting teens, and rising ticket prices that just aren't worth the money. 

Eclipse Theaters recognizes the negatives of a modern theater and makes going to the movies fun again. 

Eclipse is a new luxury theater located in downtown Las Vegas. I like that they only allow adults to buy tickets, regardless of the movie, every night starting after 9pm. The eight auditoriums feature stadium seating and reclining leather chairs. There's a bar and lounge located upstairs that opens to an outdoor patio area and fire pit. 

They also offer a full menu so you can order food or drinks during the show. Try the Wagyu burger or Maine lobster roll; the sangria is also very tasty. I would only suggest the waiters and waitresses familiarize themselves with the movies beforehand and tailor their interruptions to certain scenes. During a screening of LaLa Land our waiter brought me the check to sign at the climax of the movie. I missed the resolution to a very important plot point while authorizing payment. 

Though I'm not much of a comic book fan and was never blown away by any of the numerous X-Men films, I thought the trailer for Logan offered an interesting take on the superhero genre. The movie exceeded my expectations and ranks as my favorite film of the year. I was back a few months later for the special engagement of Logan Noir, a black-and-white screening of the film. I really appreciate monochromatic movies. Kudos to Eclipse Theaters for taking a chance on such a bold experiment. 

I'm as surprised as anyone that a superhero film ended up as my best cinematic experience of 2017, but Logan is a thrilling, superbly acted, and ultimately emotionally-draining film. Cinemas these days are filled with superhero films, but thankfully 2017 was great year for the comic book genre. Spiderman: Homecoming loses the standard superhero tropes and creates something new and exciting; quite a feat considering this is the sixth cinematic Spiderman we've had since 9/11. This incarnation of Spiderman is reborn as a high school comedy and the witty screenplay recalls John Hughes at his lightest. Michael Keaton might be the best villain to ever appear in a Marvel movie yet. I also enjoyed watching the new Guardians of the Galaxy and Wonder Woman films. 

I also attended a special screening of Pool Party Massacre, a film shot by a local Vegas filmmaker and starring porn actress Alexis Adams. The film pays homage to 80s slasher flicks, particularly the Slumber Party Massacre series. I remember my halcyon days renting spooky VHS tapes from a local mom and pop video store, so this love letter to a bygone horror era was right up my alley. 

I pay for a Gold membership of the Eclipse loyalty program and earn points every time I use my credit card to purchase tickets or food at the theater. I was pick-pocketed on Fremont Street and sent a replacement card with a new number. I was having problems updating my credit card information through the Eclipse website and couldn't reserve seats for an upcoming show that was sure to sell out. I frantically reached out to the theater's Facebook page and received a call from the manager a short time later. He updated the credit card I have on file and offered me a free dessert for my troubles. Much appreciated!

I'm also supposed to receive an Eclipse Theater t-shirt. I inquire about the availability of said shirt whenever I visit the theater. Each time the girl working behind the ticket booth told me the shirts had been ordered and should arrive in about a week. She promised to call me when they came in, but I still haven't received my shirt. I would have worn that t-shirt with pride.

I really think they should have made the section inside allowing kids as well and only keep the bar separate. We had no place to seat and eat except for a tiny bench outside in the hallway.

Cons: Pricey, kind of poor service, slow 

Details: We went to see Infinity war here and bought tickets ahead of time. When we got in, two ladies left the ticket counter leaving a third who did not at first know what to so, it was awkward. Then we went upstairs and got drinks, I noticed on the way up the carpet was pretty worn for a fairly new place. The bartender was nice but the drinks were $12-14 and pretty weak. The ticket taker gent was nice and funny. But what gets this review the two stars is what happened in the theater. The chairs were not that comfortable. We ordered right away and got deviled eggs, sliders and fries. Several people that ordered after us got their food faster than we did, we waited over 45 minutes. The food was ok, but not for the price. Because we were in front the staff walked in front of us no less that 40 times which is just ridiculous. A few times they tried to duck down but typically not.

First time we tried to redeem it, they explained that we couldn't watch a movie during premiere week. We said, fine we'll pay full price and save the tickets for another time. Theater was nice and we enjoyed the food. We decided to come back to watch Star Wars with our family (mind you that is seven of us with food...the bill added up fast!!) during premiere week and once again we saved the Groupon tickets as we knew we couldn't use them. We wanted to watch Star Wars a second time and thought this is when we get to use the Groupon! Wrong! Called the theater just to make sure we could use it and sure enough they said no. Apparently we couldn't watch Star Wars until after January first!  Way after premiere week!! ( at this point we were beyond frustrated as we had sat on this Groupon for months now...). Spoke with a ticket seller in the front desk of the theater and she finally agreed that we could use the Groupon to watch Star Wars but we could not get the popcorn or the sodas. We drove down to the theater and decided to speak to manager to explain the situation. The manager was beyond apathetic and could care less about it. She kept saying it was not the theaters fault and that there was nothing they could do. We said fine, we don't really care about the popcorn or soda at this point. Then she proceeds to tell us that we can't even watch Star Wars with the Groupon.

1466029,2017-10-09,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"I went solo to see Blade Runner 2049 the Thursday of release. I wanted to see if the theatrical experience here surpasses Galaxy Green Valley. Fantastic theater. Probably my favorite in the LV metro area, narrowly stealing the spot from Galaxy GV. 

1. Parking: Dedicated parking in the small covered parking lot. (Mini parking structure?) Very easy to get into as long as you know it's there. Lots of street parking in case that's full.

2. Customer Service: Easy check-in. Was a little weird not having an email, confirmation number, or anything else to get my ticket but it worked. Bartender was nice, usher helpful, and wait staff were pleasant. 

3. Seats: Seats were in great condition and comfy. Recline with wide armrests and a table just as you have in GGV. You have more vertical space between the rows, meaning people aren't blocking your vision if they're 7' tall. 

4. Food/Drinks: Phenomenal. I had the Buffalo Chicken Flatbread. It was exactly what I was hoping for and money well spent. Plus using a call button to order was so painless. I wish their beer selection had something local on draft, but if I'm forced to drink a beer backed by AB Inbev I don't mind Space Dust since it is a solid IPA. Drink menu looks good, spirit/wine selection looked on point.

5. Screen: A teeny bit dark but I think it might have been Blade Runner 2049's cinematography and not the theater. Very sharp and clear picture though. Great screen to watch a movie on. 

6. Sound: The weakest part of the experience for me was the sound. I think Dolby Atmos at the AMC Town Square or Galaxy's DFX Atmos at GGV or The Cannery are superior. But I think a small part of it was BR 2049's sound in general. It got a little loud and distorted like the speakers were hitting their limit. May have just been part of the movie though... This was the only 'meh' thing that I encountered.

7. Prices: $18 movie tickets are expensive but at least here or the GGV I can understand why. Eclipse, even moreso than GGV. At the time I bought this ticket, I had bought a ticket for BR 2049 in 3D DFX at GGV and refunded to try this theater out. Cost was $18 + a booking fee at Galaxy so costs are about the same for both theaters. $15 for the flatbread and $8 per beer. Not obscene and better quality than typical movie theater selection. You can pay that much for food cooked by actual cooking staff or $10 for a hotdog cooked on rollers at other theaters. Total out, pricing is pretty understandable for the experience. 

Would I come back? Yes, for movies that I want this experience. Kind of a pain to drive the 15-20mins from Henderson. Prices would not stop me from coming here.

Would I recommend to people? 100% Yes. Especially to any of my friends that need a nice date spot or want to have the best time they can at the movies.",WssZUiPMfcIcM7gdaySlZQ,3,2,5,flKFn1fh3rhp0S0Ta36lMw

While I do appreciate the idea of this novel experience, I have to admit that it was ""just okay"" in terms of execution.
Ordering our tickets online to try to select the best possible seats for such a popular movie was easy. Picking up our tickets is a different story - we felt like we went to another mediocre theater run by teenagers. We literally saw a group of girls run up the stairs as if it was social time, and they left one at the ticket counter that seemed fairly new at her job. 
Better vibe upstairs at the Lounge and presenting our tickets theater hosts. It was cool ordering at the bar, being able to sit out on the patio. Bartenders let us be for the most part unless we were ordering something. The setting seemed to be made on a budget, but was maintained inside. The patio area's furniture was ruined by outdoor elements though (dingy seat cushions). Drinks were decent in taste, but reminded me of drinking on The Strip, as in less potent for $11+ cocktails. 
Hosts we presented our tickets to were quite personable. Even made fun of the fact that I didn't hear his request to check my purse. ""Making sure you don't have any vibranium."" 
Alright... So here's where my fiance had real issues with the ""upscale experience,"" and it's a good thing we were watching this movie a second time... 
We got to settle into the theater about 15 minutes prior to the start of the movie with the detail that we had to buy tickets up front, right corner. Kudos to the space designers about keeping the area directly in front of the screen open, but they should've thought of the first row more, especially if the goal was to make this an ""upscale experience."" Don't need my ideas, just the opinion that more thought should've been put into that area. I honestly believe had we not been walked in front of several times throughout the movie during ""dinner service,"" my fiancé would've enjoyed it a lot more. Thanks to the few servers that tried ducking or walked in a fast pace - I appreciate your effort to minimize customers' frustration. 
Food was also decent in taste. We had order the Angus Sliders, French Fries and Deviled Eggs. Nothing mouthwatering. Great in variety and smart choices for menu items, since most of the food doesn't require eating utensils. I think they might be short-staffed or lacking in coordination in the kitchen though. Took more than 30 minutes for the food to arrive, and it's not like ordering at a restaurant where we order 2-3 courses spread throughout a dinner service. 
Overall, the idea of an experience like this for a smaller crowds of movie-goers is great. There's just a bit more details that should have been thought about for better execution.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,4,1,3,rMginAPyry3wW9eMHyfbOA

So i get a staff member who gets Nick the manager (that's what he said his name was, he wasn't wearing a name badge so can't be sure) we explain to him about the tickets and that we were told there was no 10pm showing and given our tickets for the 10:30pm show.. he said to let him check.. he came back and proceeded to tell me you booked your ticket for the 10pm showing.. to which i said i know that i just explained that to you and he said well the 10pm is in auditorium 2 and pointed and waited as if we were supposed to go. I said but no we were given tickets and told we had seats in the 10:30pm show because there was no 10pm showing. He continued to repeatedly ask me what time i had booked online.. as i kept replying with what we were told by his staff.

Once i was given my refund he offered the one and single ""sorry about that confusion"" in the whole interaction. I told him it was not confusion it was an error on your staffs part and you should take responsibility for that to which he replied ""i did, bye have a good night"" i cannot even believe how we were treated.. this Manager was rude from start to finish.. how is it my fault that your staff told me multiple times there was no 10pm showing and that it was 10:30pm even after showing them my reservation!?!

The over-18 atmosphere, on-site bar, and dedicated parking are pluses, and the auditoriums are intimate with comfortable, reclining seating. However, their auditoriums are few so movie options are limited, as is the seating. They could easily add in another row or two and I'm unclear why they didn't. I realize no one goes to a movie theater to be wowed by design and decor elements, but the space is so bare that it looks like it's still under construction despite being open almost a year now. That said, auditorium one had good video and sound, no issues there.

The theater itself is very unique. It looks like more a high end office then a movie theater to be honest. While the price of admission is higher then a normal theater, I felt it was certainly worth it. The price for a matinee was $16.00. With that you get a leather recliner, that's paired in 2's, so you're not sitting next to strangers. The theater holds about 30 people (literally) which is so nice. You also get your own server throughout the film. The food items looked good, however I didn't try any. We went with the sangria, which I was expecting to be your standard variety, however it was very good. It had a hint of cinnamon and was clearly hand crafted and not out of a box. 

Another thing I enjoyed was ambience in the lobby and entrance. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All around a great experience. Bye bye regular theaters, I'll be seeing all my movies here!",kFxWU1vMLdHERF2149wzCg,1,0,5,dHEgk_out_ILJlTlzoM_VQ

1962351,2016-12-30,2,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"Disappointed. That's the best word I can find to describe our experience last night. We usually go to Galaxy Theaters, but decided to try Eclipse as we are always looking for ways to support our downtown community. 
Ticket buying, easy. Price is comparable to Galaxy, so no issue there. When we arrived, we were over greeted. Awkwardly, overly greeted. Their ticket scanners didn't work, so we made our way to the reception desk, told the girls our name, tickets found. For all of the over greeting, we still had to ask where to go... they pointed up the stairs. 
This is where it got a little strange. The lobby area was basically empty, with the exception of WAY too many employees. One guy says hi, next guy asks how we are, guy next to him points to another guy and says he'll show us to our seats. We follow the last guy, have a nice chat, find our seats and get the run down. We quickly made our food and drink decisions and pushed our button. We were early, so previews hadn't started yet, and thought we could get a jump on our order. Wrong. Our waiter took a good ten minutes to show up (which is strange because of how many people I saw standing around and how empty the theater was). The ordering process was clunky, we ordered all at once and our waiter seemed confused. He talked over us, and was loud, which I worried was disturbing to the other guests.
Drinks took 20 minutes. Apps came out directly after, we got the deviled eggs and both salad cups. The food wasn't bad, but no forks. I think the idea is the salad was handheld but it wasn't. It was messy and hard to pick up, which, in the dark, proved precarious. We placed our second drink order, and they got it wrong. Didn't have my fiance's Pinot Grigio, had to come back to talk about that. A woman, not our waiter, brought me a single pour glass of red blend when I asked for a double pour. Then our waiter comes back with the double pour of an alternate wine choice and my wine, I tried to give back the other glass, he said no (and we were charged for it). Then the main course came out, lobster rolls, but we had ordered the wagyu sliders and they didn't come. We told the woman that delivered the food, she leaves, our waiter comes back, without my food, and says it was the POS system and not his fault... the problem is you can't discuss anything while the climax of Star Wars is happening so we just nod. My burgers come, finally, and they were delicious, but needless to say I was annoyed at this point.

I guess the moral of the story is they need to step up their service. I thought the theater was fine, the seats were comfy, I like that the middle arm rest raised for optimal cuddling, but the service ruined it for us. Too many hands in the pot. And a typical Vegas pitfall is when you bill yourself as VIP or luxury, that comes with an expectation of service. Especially in this town where almost everyone is in the hospitality industry. When I see so many people standing around, I expect prompt and considerate service and that just didn't happen. I'm hoping it's new business jitters, I'll try again, but not for a few months.",IhLB4wkLKjUZb9lbqkxGfg,6,0,1,1mhG9VrMmfZS3mpaMadzeA
1989838,2017-06-18,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"I went here yesterday with a group of friends yesterday to watch a movie. My first impression of this theather was am i in the right spot it looked more like a business lobby then an actual theater.which is cool cause its different.

I went upstairs to the bar to meet my friends who have been there for a minute still havent ordered or been served. The bartender comes over thanks us for waiting and asked what we wanted. My friend had asked if we check in can we get the free sangria. At first the bartender didnt want to do it because it had ended on friday but we told him it was still up on yelp so he said we can use it which was fine so my friend ordered the drink she wanted and waited......and waited..........aaannndd we are still waiting on this drink for going on 20 mins mind you this wasnt a busy bar and everyone was served or ordered. The bartender didnt acknowledge me or the other friend i was with so we left the bar area and went to sit in the lounge area til the movie started. Once the bartended seen that we moved to the lounge area he comes and ask my friend if she still wanted the drink which was a definite no thank you.

A server bought over pretzel bites as  compensation for waiting soo long. I personally would of prefered a half off drink but lets continue. The pretzel bites themselves were good....the sauce not so much.

The theather itself was nice could use some more chairs as alot of space was left good sound and comfy seats.

They have servers to bring you whatever on the menu. Which is nice to an extent im not sure how to feel with servers walking around bringing food and drinks to everyone and asking if you need anything during the movie but to each is own.
Friend ordered 2 popcorn bags and a glass of ice.....5 mins bag one comes out......10 mins bag 2 comes out.....5 mins after that glass of ice comes out basically another waiting game and couldnt figure out why everything wasnt served at once.

Other things i didnt like:
Overpricing: 18.00 for tickets 
Alcohol and food is anywhere from 12-38.00 depending on what you get when i could go to another theather with the same or similar alcohol selection and save a few bucks.

I arrived 15 mins before the movie started and the kiosk didn't recognize my credit card to print the tickets and then I had to wait in line and the service rep told me the kiosk would not print the tickets.  They need to get this corrected or take out the kiosk.

I went directly to the seat and pushed the service button and it took about 10 mins for the waitress to arrive and take my order then she started to walk around the theatre to take everyone else's individual orders.  First, the menu need to have non-alcoholic drinks besides milkshakes.  I order the Thai chicken flatbread and a chocolate shake.  The flatbread came out as two six inch pizzas with chicken, bbq sauce and onion rings, didn't taste Thai seasoning at all.  The milkshake was awful, no taste and not even smooth, very chucky with a bland taste.  Not worthy of the $10 price tag.

My food arrived about 20 mins later after the start of the movie and pretty last in the theater given I was the first one to order.  

Waitress then handed out bills to everyone at the end of the movie and I didn't receive a bill and had to walk out to the lobby and inquire about paying my bill and had to wait another 5-10 minutes for them to bring me the wrong bill and advise them of my order one more time before paying.

We made sure we parked around the side in their tiny parking garage because the area is dark and we didn't want our car broken into. The place inside is pretty nice. The bar and lounge has a good vibe and makes you just want to unwind from the day. The comedy show they have at night (not sure which nights, we went on a Thursday night) was good. Some comedians were funnier than others, but that was ok. The host was a blast, kept everybody laughing the whole time in between the acts of the night. We just wanted to get out and relax since it was a long work week. We had a good time. 

The biggest complaint I had was the drinks. We thought we'd ordered a big sangria, thinking it was enough for 3-4 drinks since it cost a little more than 2 individual ones, but we were wrong. We bought individual ones as well to compare and we got more in the individuals than we did in the big one to share. Definitely won't be doing that again. It would be nice if the drinks were a bit cheaper than they are. I think they're a bit high for the location and what you get.

We ordered a popcorn and two drinks. Not only did the server take 30+ minutes to deliver our order, but he forgot our drinks. I pressed the button to remind them and placed an order for one order of rib sliders and one order of lobster rolls (I was on a date so don't think I'm as fat as I sound hahah). Anyways, when I placed this order, we mentioned the missing drinks. The [new] server apologized and took our drink orders. This time, we were served the wrong items YET AGAIN. We were given a Diet Coke instead of a regular. And, we were given pulled pork sliders instead of rib sliders. You'd think it'd stop there. It didn't. Meanwhile, a friend who happened to be sitting next to us (small world) also placed a food order. Instead, they took her card and forgot a step--bringing her the damn food she ordered. And, that's not all folks. My girlfriend went to the restroom prior to the movie and there was no toilet paper. 2 hours and 20 minutes later, after Wonder Woman ended, I had gone to the restroom. Not one stall had toilet paper. You'd think that after nearly 2.5 hours they'd at least replace the toilet paper in this ""luxury"" theatre. Well, jokes on us.

We were early for our movie so we decided to have a drink in the bar area.  I ordered a King of Pop and Hubby ordered a Crispin Cider and a water (which never came).  Our server who was really dingy, that is the nicest way I can describe her, gave a hard sell for the 1/2 off happy hour apps.  She named off the apps and we picked two, pretzel bites and chicken lollipops.  Someone else dropped off our food and we didn't see our server again.  Finally I went to the bar to try and pay our tab.  After about several minutes I finally get to ask her to close our tab and give her my card.  Several more minutes go by before she comes back to the area and says nothing to me.  Trying to be nice, I wait.  Finally I say my movie is about to start can I sign for my bill?  She says oh the bartender will help you.  Um ok.  So now I wait for him.  Finally he comes over and asks what I need.  Just to close out my tab please.  He just stares at me blankly.  I start rattling off what I ordered.  Then the server goes Oh! you were sitting over there.  Uh yeah.  Then she asks me for my card.  I'm like you have my card I gave it to you 10 minutes ago.  Now she has the same blank stare as the bartender.  Then she goes and gets my card from some other girl.  She ""runs"" my card and then tells me I need to come enter my pin.  It is a credit card and doesn't even have a chip.  There is no pin.  She is like oh I guess I will try it again.  This time she does it right and brings me the bill.  The apps are full price.  I said didn't you say it was happy hour until 7 and apps were 1/2 price?  She says ""select apps""  Ok.  That's not what you said but fine.  She says maybe the pretzels are half off and takes my bill again.  Comes back and says I refunded your order now I need your card to charge again.   Gives me a new bill where the pretzels are discounted but not 50% off.  I don't even care at this point.  Then stands there staring at me while I sign the bill.  Who does that?

Now to the movie.  We ordered popcorn, homemade ranch potato chips and a pepsi.  Our server asks if we want to run a tab.  After all that at the bar I say no tab and give her my card which she takes and then brings back with no bill.  All the seats are in twos and set up so there is an aisle on one side.  Common sense would tell you to walk up that aisle to deliver the food.  No, not here. They will walk up a different aisle and then across everyone.  Several times throughout the movie we were brought other peoples food and drinks.  The light you use to let your server know you need something is super bright and they take forever to come.  It took about 20 minutes for a pepsi refill (you get 2 free refills on soda).  Then at the peak of the movie our server decides to bring us our bill.  In the dark, with no pen.  My husband is getting his phone out for a light and I'm digging for a pen when she finally gives me a nifty little pen with a light on it.  Now that I can see the bill there is no where to sign.  Now I have to have a discussion with her during the climax of the movie.  She thinks I want to pay cash, I have to remind her that I already gave her my card.  Finally she goes away to get the right bill and I have missed the everything that happened.  She brings my bill back with a regular pen (no light) and stands next to me in the dark, waiting for me to sign.  What is with these people?  You ran my card.  I'm not running out on the bill.   How the hell am I supposed to sign this in the dark?  It is like amateur hour here.  If you go to real luxury dinner theaters the servers are like little ninjas.  I also have to agree with Kristyne's review the recliners don't recline much and the bump in the seat gave me a kink in my neck (I am short).  Food was ok.  Not great and def not worth the price.

My only thing...don't bring kids here. With everything they do to make guests comfortable, the least we all can do is not disturb everyone. There was a kid screaming his lungs out halfway through the movie I watched, and it was disruptive. Since the parents didn't do anything to keep their child quiet, the employees had to step in and remove them from the theater.

I love theaters with recliner seats. Green Valley Luxury was my first but I've been to many brands and many locations. There's literally no other way to see a movie (except maybe in your Pj's on your couch) this one has been my least favorite so far. 

The recliners hardly recline and the large lump of a pad at the top forced my neck in an uncomfortable angle (maybe I'm not tall enough but I'm definitely not short!) 

The food was less than okay. The pulled pork on my sliders was cold and tasted like it was stored in a plastic bag and the bread was sub par. The short rib flat bread was inedible. The crust around the edge was too hard to bite and there was some kind topping that was he taste and consistency of wet dog food. The drinks had so much potential with their fun ingredients. The mule tasted like a little sprite and lot of lime and mine tasted like syrup, nothing else. The rosemary didn't translate in the drink at all other than it was there to look at, adding no flavor or scent. 

The theater design and decor was very minimalist but not in a cool funky way, more of a budget design way. Right when we walk in greeter shakes my hand, not an introduction, not a 'how are you doing' or 'can I help you' just a 'hello' and a hand shake. If you wanna chat briefly and are sincerely happy to meet me shake my hand. I'm not in the habit of shaking for the fun of it, it's flu season for gods sake, how many hands will he be touching before washing his hands? 
The theater servers in quality brands are like ninjas, not here. The server brought our check, reaching across my boyfriend to put it on my table, he shines a flashlight on his food to see if he could clear he table. Not okay. The movie isn't over you are interrupting!!! 
Picture quality was just okay. Blurry at times, it wasn't sharp and the sound wasn't anything special. I've had a 4K tv, this is not 4K (I read somewhere it was but who knows) 

I'm rooting for iPic to come to vegas , now that's a theater.  
I don't recommend and I won't be back anytime soon. Hopefully they get their act together, increase he food quality and the server training",UdCr03BnMrRZj_19Ez7wcA,7,1,1,17hWXR-TvdiklJZyFJkfeA

They are super clean, I mean sometimes you go to a movie and there's trash all over the bathrooms the floors are sticky and I usually feel I need to wash after going to a movie.  This place sparkles.  The button on the chairs to call a attendant/wait person is an awesome feature and something I only saw at the old Ziegfeld theater at the original mgm. They offer real food as well as the usual movie theater fare and it gets delivered to you. At your seat.  The drinks come in plastiglass wears and real plates, linen napkins and is top notch.  The bar inside is pretty cool as well and when our movie let out there was like an open mike comedy session going on in the lounge area of the bar that was a total surprise.  The sound system within the theater was wicked.  I mean the chairs shook when there was booms and so forth during the film which added to the experience.

2816813,2017-06-18,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"First time here at eclipse, with friends.  There's parking in the back but not a lot. So you'll have to drive up and down the side streets to find a park.  Luckily there's no charge for parking. The great thing about this place is that you can purchase tickets online or with the concierge. 
 Pros:
It's a nice place to go for a date.  It's upscale. You can order food, drinks at the bar, or inside the theater. There's a nice patio outside to overlook the neighborhood. The food looked pretty good from what I saw.

Cons:
The bar service is terrible! My friends and I waited 20 mins for our drinks.  The bartender took our order and  kept taking orders from everyone else. Another bartender didn't even ask others or acknowledge others at the bar. The one that took our order left put in other orders went to help at a party. It wasn't until we got up and left the bar that he said he would start making our drinks! Another bar patron went off on him for waiting also! 

My thing is if you're going to have a party on a Saturday night, which is the busiest nights of the weekend! Management should've had a host for the party and at least three bartenders. It takes a lot for me not to return to a business. Every business has an off day and I think this was your off day. Please regroup, strategize, for events and busy nights.

First off, I've been raving about how other cities have movie style restaurants and how that would be just a great idea. One day I stumbled upon Eclipse on yelp! and I couldn't believe it. I told all my friends!

But finally had the time to watch a movie. We saw MazeRunner (love love that movie Dylan O'Brien... drool). Located downtown area. There's parking outside and also behind there's a parking garage near an alleyway. It's not hard to find, it's well lit. And it's free parking. 

Side note, there's a Groupon floating around for this place. Check it out. Also there's a bar inside.

Seating is great. Very roomy just like luxury theaters. You push the silver button and a server will come. We got 2 pitchers of sangria (I expected a big pitcher but it was kinda small), lobster roll, wagu sliders, bruschetta, and pretzel bites. All amazing! it was literally like gourmet foods. It was unexpectedly sooooo  delicious. But it is tapas style so just prepare to order more foods. A bit on the pricey side for small bites BUT worth it, In my opinion. 

After watching a movie this way, you will never want to watch a movie regularly. Only thing is you will easily spend over $100 if you go here. It sends standards high for movie dates now. A girl goes here on a date she'll expect all movies to be like this!

The bar was beautiful, very clean and they have petty cool cocktails and bartender very friendly , he told us about the in theater dining. 

Once we sat down in the movie the server was very knowledgeable about the menu. I had the Mediterranean flatbread and my boyfriend got the waggy sliders. He liked them so much and I didn't even get the chance to try them.

The tickets are a little pricy but it's worth it!  The customer service is amazing 5 stars for sure!!  You literally press a button and they come and serve you at your theater seat as many times as you want throughout the movie!  

They just changed their age policy to allow for under 21 as it used to be 21 and over only!   Now any age is allowed before 6pm, but families be warned they are not a family friendly environment just yet.  If you come too early you don't have any place to sit or stay if your theater isn't ready and the lounge and bar are 21 and over only!  Also, their kids menu only has two options and nothing if you kids are vegetarian like mac and cheese which almost every kids menu has.

Our movie theater wasn't  ready yet and we had no place to go or sit so they literally had to get us a place to sit from the back room so don't come unless you're coming without the kids for now and if you do bring the kids, don't come till right before the movie starts!  Although we were the first ones here we sat and they came when it was finally ready to be seated, but we were the last ones to be sat and the last ones to get our order in.  

They are not family friendly yet just be forewarned!  How they plan to stay in business without the family revenue had got me curious so I hope they embrace the family idea a little more!

Resembling to what some of us implants know as iPic or Cineopolis theatres in other parts of the country that are of this style of luxury theatres. Went here during the day with my family today and had a great experience! 

There is plenty of parking around and under the theatre. I had bought the tickets online and had an easy time doing it. I do hope that as the success of the theatre increases, an phone app will evolve to make purchasing online, checking your point accumulation and special offers, just to enhance the experience even more.  Passing by the restaurant and bar, the wife and I plan to return some night to take advantage of it.  The décor is very nice and ceilings are nice and high. 

The theatre we went into were nice spacious and seeing that there are no bad seat locations in the theatre. Even the seats closest to the screen are not to close where it will hurt your neck, (like other theatres). The chairs are ultra comfortable and the rows are deep enough so should the wait staff need to deliver any menu items to a person in the middle of the row, they won't bump your chair in doing so.

We came hungry so we did eat. We had the Caesar salad, hummus plate, salt and pepper fries and an order of the Lobster Rolls. They do serve alcohol but we chose to save it for next time. The food that we did order was good. Way better than what is offered at other theatres in Vegas and we look forward to try more the next time we come back. 

The staff and weight staff were very nice, polite and the overall experience was awesome! 

I know that some people may have a hard time accepting the price point, but from our point of view, we would pay this price point for the quality, service, experience and comfort that Eclipse Theatres delivers without thinking about it.

I almost never go to the cinema; the combination of raging ADD and boredom with mainstream amusement usually make me a terrible companion for the theater. But every so often I aim to please my better half and Eclipse made the experience truly memorable and FUN!

First of all I get it, maybe going on Valentine's Day is not that best idea. But parking sucks! How are you going to have a garage that only fits like 10 cars.....?
Anyways let's move on.

Staff was friendly, checked in with my first & last name for tix. We were told where to go when we arrived upstairs we were asked to show ID.
Right away we headed over to the bar and got a drink. 
I had the ""Life is beautiful"" drink, it was delicious but way too sweet for me. The boyfriend wanted an APA but they only had Coors on tab, gross. He ended up getting an old fashion, and he said his drink was also made too sweet. We paid and took our drinks to the outside patio. Weather was perfect so it made sitting outside so nice. The boyfriend got to vape & enjoy his drink before the movie. 
We were meeting some friends so when they arrived we proceeded to get seated. 

We got seated and looked over the menu. On your seat there's a small blue button that you press when you are ready to order. We decided on the ""Pretzel bites & Carnivore flat bread"".
The pretzel bites taste like.... pretzel bites. Both dipping sauces were mediocre nothing special. For the flat bread I was not a fan either. Even tho you can see it being made as you walk by, it had a really strong processed or frozen taste. Not sure what it was but I would not get it again.

Our server did a great job and so did the lady who dropped our food and picked up our empty plates.

Over all this place is really nice and a great spot for date night. I don't know about coming here all the time, especially with parking and how high drinks are priced.
Seating was comfortable but you can recline a lot more at a Galaxy movie theater than here.

Street parking on a Sunday evening wasn't hard to find and there were more parking towards the back too. When I entered a security guard and a front desk lady greeted us. There are two kiosks located to the left of the doors if you already made online reservations or need to buy tickets. The front desk lady looked up my phone QRS code and handed me paper receipts for our movie, but that didn't make sense because my ticket was on my phone which specifically stated about scanning the QRS code in the first place to avoid touching paper to begin with. We headed upstairs and to the left was a bar lounge that greeted us. If you check in there's a complimentary sangria beverage to redeem so holla! For a Sunday evening being that it wasn't that busy I'm surprised how long it took to get a glass of red wine and for starters since we could bring drinks inside the theatre let the bartender know so that they can provide the right cups for the lounge chairs. Walking to the auditorium a guy checked our paper ticket and guided us by following the lit up numbers. The plain greyness of the hallways remind me of the twilight zone. The max capacity for the theatre states 49. During the previews a hostess greeted us to let us know about our call button on the chairs for service regarding food and beverages. I ordered fries and a margherita pizza with avocados. My server took my card as an open tab but then returned it once she bussed our table during the movie so I was confused but then after the movie ended she yelled at me in the hallway about forgetting my tab so that cleared up my confusion.

There's much I like about this place, I think my favorite is the space between seats.

I love stadium seating but so sit in a theater seat where I don't have to rub elbows with someone else  is awesome.

The other part about the seats is that the tray that holds my food and liquor. It's not in the way of my experience and I love the tiny button where it summons the wait help so I can continue ordering drinks and more food.

Speaking of food, much of the menu is bar bites or small plates, which is great because eating popcorn can get a bit tired now a days and this theater features some really great food offerings.

I have to give a shoutout to the staff, they were friendly and courteous and made the experience a little more enjoyable.

She was beyond sweet and very informative. She signed me up for the VIP reward program very fast and explained it to us. Got us through a speedy experience and pointed us to the elevators.

The food menu looked great but we ate before so we were looking for more drinks and dessert. Next time I'll plan to make a movie and dinner of it. We ordered beers and milkshakes. That was perfect. My partner also got a popcorn. 

I was upset because they brought me a chocolate cake slice, despite being amazing I thought the server bought it for me to be sweet, but apparently not. We were charged for it but didn't even order it?! We paid and realized when we were home. I'm letting it go but next time only bring what people order. This was a small hiccup in a great experience. Maybe a manager will reach out and try to fix it. Still would come back, a lot actually. Place is clean and ran well. Can't wait to see the progression.",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,9,4,5,aH1W4BQfi08wo3EueEJeHQ

The managers excuse is that liquor is served in the theaters, I explained that there are 6 other premium theaters in Las Vegas that serve liquor and none of them are 21 and over. Nice enough place but certainly nothing special and still not sure why they are charging $18 a ticket. Save the money and go to Regal, AMC or Galaxy theaters for a premium movie experience in Las Vegas.

I ordered the Spanish Trails, that has a very smoky taste but overall delicious and a unique taste! My hubby ordered the Life Is Beautiful, I tried his drink and for not being someone who loves bourbon his drink tasted amazing! We took our drinks to the theater and went and sat down our amazing server Michael was sweet, professional and was very attentive! Thank you Michael for your amazing service and making our movie experience a complete delight!

Outstanding new theater in downtown Las Vegas.  For $18/movie, you are given a reclining seat and plenty of room in the theater.  They offer seat-side service to order food or drinks at the push of a button.  Their menu includes a typical-sized flatbread, a half dozen slider options (3 in each order), desserts, or your typical movie fare.  They also have a legitimate full bar area with a lounge and a few TVs.  I could see myself coming here to watch a game and then catching a movie directly after.  For $18 it may seem steep, but a typical movie ticket in Vegas is about $13-15 anyways so you're paying for the luxury and space, and not at much of a premium.  I will surely be back and order some food next time and make a full experience out of it.  Prices are all very reasonable and within the range of the area.  With 8 theaters and a full menu of movie selections, you can't go wrong with Eclipse.  Note that the venue is 21+ so even better for a nice kid-free movie-going experience.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,2,4,pJbf0AMYHDI5FP0JgO99Pw

The theater seemed kinda small to me but it was roomy once you get to your seats. They have a bar on the side before you enter the theater room. I swear we were greeted everywhere as we came in. 

Once you arrive at your seats, you get an individually folded napkin and there's a button on your table thing. They have a full menu of food too not just snacks. I mean mostly bar food. They don't have a concessions stand so the servers bring them to you. 

The seats were really comfy! I think of all the relaxing theaters this is probably most comfy for me. 

The only reason they didn't get a 4 or 5 Star was because the area is pretty far for us and the parking lot was behind the building so if you're rushing you'll miss it. Or if you're not familiar with the area you'll miss that turn in. Plus the projector was pretty loud. I couldn't hear some of the quieter talking parts of the movie. In turn, I'd probably have to rewatch this movie. But would I come back? Probably when it's convenient",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,3,0,3,Q3ICC8xSruwxVG4Epc750w

Don't get me wrong, this was one EXPENSIVE learning experience... but it was interesting nevertheless.

We were guided by someone during each and every moment. From the front lobby where we got our tickets, up the stairs to the theaters, to our specific screen, and even to our seats, where there was a very nice guy named Octavio who explained that he'd be serving us for the next few hours. We were just to press a small button on the arm of our leather recliner seats and he'd be there asap.

The food menu was pretty impressive. They had the classic movie snacks (popcorn, candy, soda, etc.), but there were also gourmet sliders, chicken lollipops, a few different salads, and other fancy pants finger foods - all for movie theater prices (or EXPENSIVE!) My bf and I ordered two different slider plates, french fries, and one soda. The bill was a whopping $50 after tip! ..and that's NOT including our actual movie tickets...

Staff very friendly. Really cool locals artwork displayed for sale throughout theater. We sat at the bar area first which is huge with tons of big windows. Theres even an outdoor seating with fire pit. Cool atmosphere. Our drinks were a litle pricey but very tasty with fresh ingredients.
When going into actual theater our tickets didnt actually match up with our seats, so we had to go out and get clarification. After finding our seats which were comfy & reclined we ordered our apps. Quick service. Our tots and potato chips came during previews- perfect! 
The tots were fried nice but not greasy. Potato chips were light and crisp but would be better warm. Dipping sauces for both very tasty. 
The previews included a video from the theater with all these amazing seasonal drinks and foods but none were actually on our bar OR theater menus, so that was kinda a bummer considering it came on after ordering

I went a few nights ago to see a late-night film and though it was a beautiful, clean theatre with lovely service, there were a few things that made us decide to not return:

-We were greeted by an employee who escorted us to our designated theatre...and then realized he brought us (and another unsuspecting couple) to the wrong theatre and after ordering food and drinks, we had to get up and move to the correct room. 
-The food was not good and very overpriced, as was the ticket itself. We ordered a box of Raisinets...we received a very small amount of the candy poured into a glass dish. I just wanted the box of candy. 
-The seats don't recline back enough. I'm spoiled by the other luxury theatres in Vegas going back more and being comfier.

me cringe a bit IMO. So if you're feeling a bit boujee, come here! I don't recommend watching a movie you're dying to see here because as much as it sounds great to have a dinner and movie at the same time, it can get extremely distracting when there are servers coming back and forth to guests in every row. I recommend reserving seats farther from the entrance so you can avoid the amount of people from blocking your view of the screen. 

The food is okay, nothing really wowed me. Nachos which were $10, wasn't worth it. For the extra $5 for steak, I felt stiffed out on the amount of steak that was added. The buffalo chicken flatbread was alright as well. I enjoyed the taste of the dough that they use for the flatbread! The popcorn was probably the more impressive one as they use real butter and salt. Drinks were very tasty!! We ordered a pitcher of Sangria ($22) and the Life is beautiful cocktail. All so damn good!!! The pitcher probably filled up about 4 small glasses.

Because alcohol is served, children under the age of 21 is not permitted to shows after 6pm.  The ticket booth is to your left as you enter.  Gentlemen was very friendly.  He  asked if we'd been here before.  Because it was our 1st visit, he explained how the operation was set up. $16 for adult tickets, $12 for children 16 and under.  On Tuesdays, all tickets are $12.  Nice.

We took the staircase up to the 2nd floor met by another gentleman who processed our tickets allowing us to proceed in.  A nice lounge bar, cordoned off, to the left with big windows gave a some what nice view of the city.  You could see some planes going in and out of the airport.  Fascinating.

We found our seats easily.  No rush needed because it is reserved seating.  Menus were there.  The room is not very big.  They were clean.  No stickiness on the table thank goodness.  In the center of the table is the call button you depress once you decide what you would like to order.  We just ate but decided to get the nachos, turkey sliders and a drink.  $31.60 for all that.  Not cheap at all.  Well for the experience.  The girl taking our order was nice, as in nice to look at but cold as stone.  Everything else was by the book and the order came out right after she came back to tell me they were out of the smoked bbq  chicken  sliders.  It was the 1st show of the day.  Hence, why I opted  for turkey.

We enjoyed the movie.  We do know how to pick 'em.  Loved the reclining seats.  These are now the standard,  If the theaters can come down in the price it would be nice.

I wasn't impressed with the food.  At those dollar prices there should be a wow factor.  Meat on the nachos would be a good start.  I didn't even know there were jalapenos until the the chips and cheese were gone.  Could you please put them last, on top.  The $14 turkey sliders was not that good either.  Using a previous frozen turkey paddy does not make the price. Neither does the sweet bbq sauce to give some taste hiding everything else about it.  The drink is unlimited.  Cold ginger ale we shared with lots of ice was so good to have in this over the top 100 This is a degree heat wave that has taken over the town.

This is a nice theater to come to.  It's not crowded.  Feels subdued, relax and chill.  Might be good to come into the bar in the later evening to see the city lights.  It's clean. Quiet.  I would  come back but I would not want to order off the mneu.",h6aZg8OfwRnMVKloX7tBDA,16,14,3,U5WoCwnXzHPeOYkstFqhsQ

Love the seats and the experience and would definitely do it again on a date or other special occasion! My only real downfall was the location as it was very odd , no real signage for parking ( we opted for street parking then found out there was a lot ), as for service it was usually quick and attentive but lapsed a little during the show , maybe I'm being picky but I don't like dirty dishes around me when I dine and when I'm finished I want the empty plates gone !! The plates stuck around for most of the movie and maybe being a little OCD I kept on looking at them and was distracted from movie lol , as for food we opted for flatbreads buffalo chicken and Thai chicken both were flavorful and rather nice portions , we also had apps which were the pretzel bites , they tasted microwaved and cheese sauce was bland , the fries were tasty but the side of ketchup to fry ratio was pretty bad, I ended up leaving about half the fries !

Boyfriend orders one large popcorn for us within five minutes of being seated via the armrest button which summons a server. Gives said server a $10 bill. Over 30 minutes roll by without any sign of food being served anywhere. Pushed the button again, asked a different server when we could expect our popcorn and were curtly told ""We haven't started serving food yet."" Oh really? Maybe the popcorn is made-to-order in this theater, which would be the only reason I could possibly think of as to why our popcorn was grouped in the same category as chicken fingers and burgers and was to be served alongside them. Ridiculous. Wait ANOTHER 30 minutes before noticing that everyone- including the couple next to us with three popcorns- had received their food and we had not. One popcorn, people. Pushed the damn button again and tell the server we've been waiting over AN HOUR for popcorn that hasn't come, please give us our money back. ""Okay,"" she says, without a care or concern in the world. No apology given. Another 15 minutes rolls by while we watch this same server walking up and down the aisles distributing bills and wrapping up orders. What the actual ****. Call her AGAIN, ask where the hell our refund is. ""Oh, she didn't bring it yet?"" I say, ""who is 'she'???? I asked YOU!"" Wait another 15 minutes for our $10 bill to come back to us. No popcorn, no apology, pure B.S.

I've never really known a movie theater to feel like a ""Neighborhood Theater"" but  this one certainly does. It also has a bit of an Art House Theatre vibe to it as well, complete with a full lounge the included an outdoor patio.  
As I walked up, after parking my car DIRECTLY in front of the place (Rockstar Parking, always a plus), I looked up to see a couple enjoying the moonlight as they leaned along the patio railing. Such a really mantis sight that greet my entrance into the Eclipse Theatre. 
The ""Ticketmaster"" (he was so fly, he NEEDS to have a title) was very cordial and informative. He also seems to love the fact that he works there because he seems to genuinely thinks it's a great spot. 
I can't argue with him. 
The theaters are spacious but with only about 50 seats in each theater. 
Their reclining seats also have a tray in front of it so that when you order food from the server you can really eat out at the movies. 
Oh, did I mention the nifty little call button that you use to order food? Well, there's that.

4352970,2018-02-21,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"This place is awesome! The only initial issue is finding parking. We went for a weekday matinee so luckily there was still street parking available.  I am not sure how we would have faired on the weekend in the evening, since as far as I could tell it did not have it's own lot.  Once you get past that inside its very clean and classy.   The box office is inside downstairs,  and upstairs is a bar and resturant and the theaters.  The seats in the theater are assigned.  Each theater has cushy reclining chairs and a movable tray table.  They have a drink and food menu and a button you can push to have them take your order at your chair.  They actually have a wide ranging menu from chicken fingers to lobster rolls,  beer, sangria etc.  

 Also an important thing to note, the movie actually started at the movie time, not the previews.   I know some people run late and use the previews as a buffer,  so don't do that for here.   The only reason I am knocking off the one star is the limited street parking,  half of it is in zones if you are there before 6pm you can only park for 2 hours.  Again maybe not that big of a deal since after 4pm it's a moot point, but some people also may be uncomfortable with parallel parking.

4471222,2018-02-01,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"So I both like and dislike Eclipse Theater. There were things they did very well, and things that need work. The concept is excellent, but the execution needs some work. It looks like they really tried, they really did, but things are a bit early for them. They are downtown, and to get to the parking garage, you have to go down a dark alley, not a great start, but sometimes there's only so much you can do. I would recommend adding some exterior lights, if possible.

Once inside, the place was very very clean, new and the staff were very very friendly and welcoming. The gentleman that checked our tickets, black guy, don't remember his name, was very energetic, and happy to be there. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was a co-owner or has stock in the company. He's the most helpful ticket checker I've ever met. He's also the same guy that is in the Eclipse previews before the movie. There's a nice bar, that has a elevated view of old downtown. Inside is beautiful, but looking outside, makes you wonder what you are doing in this neighborhood. It kind of reminds me of SoDoSoPa in South Park. lol.

There is very nice local artwork down the hallway leading to the theaters, that is available for sale. Every piece seems to be $ 2000.00 and I like the ambiance it creates. In the theater, at least the auditorium we were in, all the front seats are missing. Not sure if they ran out of money, if they didn't think they could sell them, or what, but it feels odd to have the stadium seating steps, with no seats on them. The seats in the upper part of the theater are luxury seats, which seems to be the norm now, but they don't recline as far as I'm used to like at Galaxy. I do like though that the armrest can be flipped up between each seat pair, so each couple can have a small couch.

There is waiter service, with a call button that serves alcohol and food, which is a great idea, and should be in every theater, but unfortunately this is where they missed it on execution. Great great concept, but the drinks are tiny, and all the food was very small portions. They should all be called appetizers, not just the appetizer section. The food felt like bar food, which isn't bad, but i wish it was presented that way, I was quite hungry, expecting meal service. Everything was also very expensive. For a couple, that watches one movie, orders one ""meal"" each, and a tiny drink each, expect to pay over $100.00. So plan on forking over some money for snack and a movie here.

All in all, this is a very great concept, but some details need to be worked out. Hopefully these things get better in the future. Unfortunately they missed the mark.",O9Z3VmQjBEfGp-ZI6XSa3g,2,2,3,sCxlIG8RqE885_k5NL9bRg

Pretzel and sweet potato tots were super over priced and came with ""honey mustard"" which was horse radish with a little mustard mixed.  And BBQ chicken sliders that tasted old.  Pushed button and waited about 4 or 5 minutes before I got up to get just regular yellow mustard from kitchen or bar. Was told they don't have any so asked for ketchup instead.

Location is odd- very little parking and in a not so great part of town. Theater is nice, would have expected a little more upon entering. There are very few signs, just an empty lobby. The ""ticket guy"" (? I'm not sure what their official title is) was very nice and explained the process to us which was very nice because we had no clue what to do. We went to the lounge prior to our movie because we were 30 minutes early and the theater wasn't ready. We got two drinks which were fairly expensive, but we expected that being locals. The drinks were good, but were served in a plastic cup. That always turns me off. An expensive, hand crafted drink in a plastic cup. 15 minutes to the movie we went and took our seats. The theater is set up nice and has very nice, comfortable seating. The server came over to take our order- we got the sausage flat bread, pulled pork sliders, popcorn and a coke ($$$). Again, expensive, but we knew so didn't worry to much about it. About 15 minutes into the movie food begins to come in, I personally didn't get distracted, but I could imagine other individuals would hate the servers running around delivering food and drinks. 

This is really were things took a turn from a good experience to a mediocre one. The server brought all of our food together, but no drinks in sight. We waited a little while to see if it would show up, but never did. Who wants to eat without a beverage? We started eating anyway, we were starving at this point. The sausage flatbread was fine. Nothing to write home about. The pulled pork sliders were extremely dry, hence the need for a beverage at this point, but it still had not arrived. The sliders had no sauce that I could tell (it was dark) and dry coleslaw? Overall a bland, dry meal. Our coke arrived about halfway through our meal (thank goodness) and it was tiny. All ice. I was expecting a much larger drink so we didn't have to constantly ask for refills from the obviously busy servers. We sucked it down in a matter of minutes and left the rest of our popcorn knowing we would want a beverage and didn't have one. 

At the end of the movie a server dropped off our tab/credit card. We left with a very ""meh"" feeling. The movie we watched was great, but we could have watched it closer to home, in a reclining seat, with alcohol at our local theater.

I also kept hearing about their amazing food and Bar located inside the building. The location is a little tricky- it doesn't really look like a Theater on the outside, because it's surrounded by buildings and houses, so I was a bit hesitant, and I believe it might deter people from going, but once you step inside it's a whole a new story, the place is huge and the theater is on the second floor along with the a balcony you can sit outside and drink drinks prepared by the bartender- that's right their is a bar and it's good!

The concept is cool, I like that you can press a button and have your drinks/food ran to you so you don't have to miss any of your movie. However my last visit was the last and final straw, my button never works.... I sat for 45 minutes waiting for someone to come get my order until the little blue light finally went off and I got up to go get my stuff, I sat at the bar for about 10 minutes to get some drinks and popcorn and finally made my way back to the movie.

4588778,2017-09-07,1,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"This is probably the nicest movie theater in Vegas. It is a great date spot for locals who want to enjoy some fine drinks and food.

Location: the theater is near Downtown last Vegas and is in somewhat of a random location with small apartments nearby. 

Environment: the theater itself is very nice from the minute you enter their garage in the alleyway. The theater entrance is spacious and large and there is a nice bar you can order drinks and food before you watch the movie. The theater really makes you feel cool, and it's a pretty good way to get your date to think so too. There are about like 20 couches some individual and the others mostly paired. They recline as you like and there is table for the drinks and food. I usually order the food and drinks in the theater with a button that sends out their staff who are pretty quick to assist. You might think this can get in the way of watching a movie, but it hasn't bothered me yet. In fact, I rarely notice, I just feel pampered.

Movies: the showings are pretty limited, I would make sure you go online to see if the movie is playing.

Food and drinks: I pretty much enjoyed all of their cocktails and sangria, I think it is better than most bars or restaurants. The food is delicious too, with many small snacks.

Overall, great date spot, great service, and a very cool feel.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,4,2,4,TOARjb_Aj677jV9fhgY6Pw
4593157,2017-08-29,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"I was really looking forward to going to this theater.  It started out promising because the staff is friendly and attentive.  The concierge explained the process to us when we checked in and when we arrived at the usher, she explained that the theater wasn't ready yet.  She invited us to sit in the lounge.  

The lounge was large and cavernous.  There was a bar with one couple sitting at it.  Another couple was standing near a counter, and the rest of the place...dark and empty.  It was nicely appointed with a variety of comfortable couches and banquettes.  The outside patio on the second floor offered a nice view and had a fire pit which was off (probably due to the heat).

Once we were seated, our server, Stefania, arrived promptly and explained the menu.  She offered suggestions and was friendly.  I placed an order for two soft drinks and an order of the barbecue sliders.  The drinks came out and were exactly as expected.  The sliders...well...not so much.  The buns were hard and bordering on stale.  The cole slaw and crispy onions on the barbecue were nice.  But the chicken was tepid.  It was shredded, which was nice, but the strands were tough and chewy.  There was enough barbecue sauce to make the sliders messy to eat, but unfortunately, the flavor of the barbecue was countered by the size of the buns, which absorbed most of the flavor of these sandwiches.  I definitely would not order them again, and I felt taken advantage of for $14.  

During the movie, the I was still hungry.  So, I pressed the button and ordered the salt and pepper fries.  They arrived promptly and were hot and crisp.  The salt was noticeable, the pepper was non existent.  The price, at $6 was adequate and I can't complain, because the quality and portion size were there.

So when I get the bill, the $32 plus was a little steep.  The movie going experience was great and the audience was very respectful and considerate of each other.  Would I return?  Probably for the movie, but I will make sure to eat somewhere else beforehand.  I don't mind paying for quality.

The quality of the food and drinks are good though. I had to check this place out because how good it looked on the outside, but was surprised that I have not heard of this theater before. It's located downtown on 3rd and Gass St, so around the court houses and bail bondsman facilities. Went in the daytime and glad I did. I usually don't venture downtown in that area late night because it gets sketchy down there. There is a garage parking at the theater which was nice because it was really hot outside, but finding it was kinda tricky because it was off to the side of the building and didn't have signs indicating it  was parking for the Eclipse Theaters. I had to ask the front desk theater person ( which would be the ""box office"" counter ) that the parking garage for the theater just to make sure  I wouldn't get a ticket or get towed. Very friendly service as each ticket even during the day is $18 per adult ( that's not even 3D or IMAX). You then go upstairs to the theater area and to the left is the bar where you can get food and drinks or just drinks and food and just hang out in their very spacious lounge area. Bartender was fast and friendly. The Summerlin Fix cocktail was very refreshing (watermelon, gin, vodka, lemon, and bitters) and the wine was good. The 2 drinks came out to about $30 with tip. Went to actual movie, sat down in a very clean reclining leather seat, pressed a button of the table and server came to take the food/drink orders. Had the wagyu sliders, 3 came in an order, and the Carnivours Delight flatbread. Both were very flavorful and tasty. Had the whole theater to ourselves so no complaints about that.lol. Maybe that's what having a private theater feels like. The bathrooms are very clean too. One other thing to point out is that no kids after 6 pm at this place so if you're looking for date night or evening without the kids this would be the place. Overall, very nice theater, good customer service, great place for first date night, and private parties/special events.

Once you're inside, you pay for your ticket and head up to the 2nd floor. It's on the pricey side but that age policy is certainly a plus. There's no concessions here. They have a bar and restaurant but you can order from your seat. I ended up getting the margherita flatbread, popcorn, and a soda. The popcorn was good, super buttery, but it didn't sit too well. Maybe too much butter for me. I gave up on that and waited for the flatbread. No complaints there, it was good. Our server was friendly but she never came back to close out our tab.

The reason, we celebrated our pre-anniversary here, a very special celebration. Our 22nd Anniversary, in luxury style at the Eclipse theater. We even toasted to our 22nd with champagne. 

 Eclipse is a very upscale theater with 8 auditoriums, with theater food and beverage service. As you enter, the box office is on the first floor, you will have the option to purchase your tickets on line, at the box office, or the 2 kiosk near the entrance. You will also get to select your seats. The theater, bar, & bathroom is located on the 2nd level. Once you get to your seat & get comfortable, get ready to push that button for service. 

My husband and I really enjoyed our first time experience here with champagne, food, & theater food and beverage service. I love the food and beverage service concept. We now have the luxury reclining seats in Hawaii but without the wait service. I noticed the screens are huge, seats are bigger and there is more leg room. The food tray & drink holder are just perfect. I was having such a great time, I was so comfortable, I didn't want the movie to end. 
 
If you are early for your movie, I love the idea that you can hang out in the bar or patio area. We made it just in time for our movie. I recommend coming in a few minutes before the movie, so you can look at the menu and find your seats. I had a hard time, to decide on what to order since it was dark. Our waitress was super friendly & quick, I placed my order of popcorn with extra butter, sweet potato tots, chicken wings (with request for ranch sauce on the side) & champagne. I do miss the Mochi crunch with my popcorn. The popcorn was buttery & fresh with just right amount of salt. The tots & chicken were very tasty for theater food. I've never had sweet potato tots before.

As you walk in you look around and wonder if you are in the right place. I ask myself, ""Am I checking into a 5 star resort or am I going to the movies""!? The front receptionist asks us what movie we would like to enjoy. How nice, she wants to know what I would enjoy, I like this girl already!

Tickets are $18 each and can be purchased online (recommended so you can pick your seat) or at the front desk.   With our tickets in hand we venture off to the lounge I've been told is a ""must see"" with a gorgeous view of the Downtown Art District, plush chairs and stools, and a bar! We are served food and drink menus and told that we can order at the bar or in the theater. They will serve us dinner and drinks inside the Theater while we watch the movie!? I ask to clarify if I'm hearing correctly because this I have NOT experienced before in a Vegas movie theater. Yes, we have upgraded to full service dining, with amazing food I must add!

Food/Drink:
Bottle of wine for $45 (J.Lohr ""Seven Oaks"" Cabarnet) at the lounge, highly recommend!

Check in on Yelp for a free glass of Sangria! Yes Please :) You have to do this with the server and I'm recommending to do this during the previews, or some mean dude behind you might scold you for having your phone on for the first 4 seconds of the movie!

Buffalo Chicken Flatbread with Celery Confetti (I totally couldn't figure out what I was eating in the dark so I had to look it up on the menu after the show) This is probably the best flatbread, chicken, confetti creation I have ever eaten.

Caprese Bites were pretty small portions and I probably wouldn't get those again, but the flatbread was so incredibly delicious we still filled our bellies to the max!

The theater is perfect....absolutely fit for the perfect date night out! They have comfortable recliners with drink holder tables that swivel and give you a tray front and center of your reclining experience to enjoy your meal. If I created a home theater, these cool tray tables would be on my recliner chairs! Perfection in sound and picture would be an understatement. This was hands down the best movie watching experience I've ever had.  I really like the adult movie theater trend with shows before 6pm being okay for under 21, but all movie show times after 6pm are for adults, over 21 + only.

The 3 of us decided on the $12 summer fizz, two out of 3 did not like gin and they accommodated them with no problem by making them a drink because the drink was ""pre-made"". 15 minutes for those cocktails.  I'll post pic of it! We revived less than half a champagne glass of the special. No worries they sale crafs inside of sangria $22 we will order a few of those to share once inside. We decide to go outside on the deck you can get a small view of downtown lights! My mind totally was like I can't wait to have a huge get together here. We took our shot I mean drank our specialty cocktail and headed inside 15-20 minutes prior to start of move we wanted to get our orders in before the movie for food and more drinks. We get in and it's really nice and intimate, perfect!!!! We are greeted by the server right away,I allowed her to suggest my meal I chose tai wings, also pork sliders, pretzel bites, and sweet potato tots(we each ordered different) I personally wanted wings only I asked her if they had fries she said absolutely I asked her to add that as well, not to forget we need to sangrias crafs on our row as well as waters. Perfect timing lights out and movie begins we are instructed to press button for any assistance. I forgot right as she walked away the 8th person in the party showed up. She figured she run out and add her order they instructed her to come in and press the button. I said don't worry they should be coming back with drinks soon then you can order. About 35 minutes later the food begins to come for each way and ""some"" drinks. Awe how cute the $22 sangria was a mini craf for one! Whatever it's girls night!! I was told that she would return with the other sangria, by the way no fruit in the sangria (cheap, I'm sure it was bottled and not freshly made it reminded me of arbor mist eww). The movie is super funny (Girls Trip) so we are very entertained. Then I remember where's my drink? Where's my fries? Why haven't you ordered? Lights have been on?Then more pretzels arrive, I thought maybe some ordered them so I grabbed them we quickly realized no one ordered those and no one wanted them!no server returns, I get up to find a manager(or maybe host) I explain what's going on she stops another server explained our issue, she tells me mam I'll be right there to personally take care of you.Another 20+ minutes goes by no one! My other friend is thirsty!! A server came up on both sides orders are redone I was asked ""what did you want"" by the new server I said I'll just have a talk with the manger if you don't mind, she then said ""we'll turn off your light"" I said I'll turn it off once the manger comes she snatches the dishes off the tray ""which I wanted to show the manger"", and huffed and walked away. I just went and got the manger, here we go again!""I'll send someone right away I'm sorry blah blah blah she even takes my number"" the waitress walked by me and rolled her eyes at me, I pointed it out to the manager....went back inside there was another manager there I gave him a very quick run down ""sorry blah blah blah"" fast forward movie is almost over my friend never got any of her order not even water (after she gave her order 2x, because they came to ask her about it again). I received a check with those dang pretzels on it, which the server dropped the check and ran away, never could get any service for my friend, freaking water!Waitress came bAck asked if we need change we said no not ready I said hold on please can you fix my check she did! Now the movie is over we are the last in the theater waiting for change helping the maintenance men clean up!I'm disappointed that management really dropped the ball!Dang you could've sent out free popcorn or double back to check on us NOTHING!We wanted to stay and have more drinks after the movie but decided to all go home our girls night out celebration was ruined!I understand this industry I am manger in it!!! I know you get busy I know orders are forgotten! But always aim to fix it no matter what!!Even if your guest say it's okay! FIX IT!!None of us will go back! Itl be interesting to see if I get a call about this since she took my name and number lol!I live this 10+ hours a day, a lot of tweaking is needed!

5134900,2017-03-17,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"I have a love/hate relationship with the Eclipse, which is a boutique movie theatre with full food/beverage service (including alcohol) at your seat.  After 8-10 movies, I can offer the following...

There are a lot of reasons to love it:

1.  Convenience - Parking is plentiful and easy.  Location is ideal for Downtowners, UMC folks, Arts District and the north Strip hotels.  

2.  Comfort/Aesthetics:  Theaters are new/modern, reclining leather seats, small/intimate (50 seats in the largest theater, 25 in most), spotlessly clean.  Bathrooms are also clean and well-maintained.  You won't find a sticky mess anywhere at this theater.

3.  Service:  The staff is outstanding - friendly and service-oriented.  Food/Beverage (including alcohol) is served at a central bar/lounge AND at your seat in the theater.  The servers are always attentive.

4.  Food:  It's good.  Period.

5.  Movie Selection:  They always have the latest movies, although the selection is usually limited to four or five.


But I have some complaints....

1.  Website:  Clunky and often difficult to complete a purchase.  It takes time to reserve your seat online, but when you arrive at the theater you are forced to stand in another line to get a printed ticket.  They have kiosks, but the kiosks never work.  And you can't print a ticket online and get into the movie theater without standing in line again at the theater.  A definite negative.

2.  Price:  I don't think $18 for a movie is expensive, especially for the quality of this experience.  But the food and drinks are not cheap.  I had a $14 BLT/Avocado (with xtra chicken) salad last night that left me hungry - portions are small.  Other items (sliders, flatbreads) are a better value.

3.  Lighting:  In most theaters that serve food at your seat, there is a small light to help you see what you are eating (or see the menu if you want to order something additional).  Nada at Eclipse.  When your food arrives, you are eating in darkness.  So stick with finger foods because firing-up the flashlight on your phone is bad movie etiquette!

4.  Projector Noise:  If you are seeing Deadpool, this is a non-issue.  But on a quiet flick, you can hear the projector whirring in the back.  Best not to sit on the back row.


Overall, I am a fan of the Eclipse (and its staff) and I think Downtown is very lucky to have such a high-quality movie theater.  If you haven't been....GO.  It is unlike any other movie experience in Las Vegas.  And it's nice to have a beer, watch a movie and not be parked 4 football fields from the theater!",YLiNhJUwogXgIwCa3wrWKg,7,0,4,ZVtMPb9XsO_w47Zr-3mfOw
5181450,2017-12-25,2,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"Hello and welcome to Eclipse Theaters. We were attending a holiday party when at the last minute we decided that a movie would be fun spontaneous thing to do. Our friend lives not far from here and said it is the new in theater in downtown area in Las Vegas. This place also sits next to 21 greens which I really want to check out. We went to see The Last Jedi and got the last 4 seats in the theater for that time of the night. These are more corporate theaters for event style events has an open area in front of screens for if you wanted to have a cocktail hour before seeing a movie or a corporate thing. They are also building a glassed in area above the main theater in a couple theaters for private parties that cannot be heard from the general public area. Station Casino did this in a few of theirs when they first built theaters in their properties. 
On to the review....We arrived about 30 min before the show with our seats reserved on an iphone. Parking is a bit rough especially for this particular show. my friend said parking not always this way when they have been before. We arrived at our seats and ordered drinks from there. There is a button you push to have an attendant come to your seat and take an order. We ordered a diet Coke and a Coke. Only $5 so not bad. It came in a glass and was sufficient i suppose for a movie beverage for $5. The main thing that was a bit odd, was the lady took my money and brought receipt but not a drink. The beverage finally arrived about 10-15 minutes later just as movie was starting. They also have a food menu where you can order several appetizers from the bar and lounge attached to the theater. It did seem that they were a little under prepared for a busy night this movie caused. Thus the 3 stars. The sound and projection were great and the chairs were comfortable lounge chairs. 
Thank you for attending Eclipse Theaters. I do want to go again and see if the quickness of the wait staff changes. Also 3 stars for parking, but not much to choose from due to location of Venue. If you want to go to an off the beaten path luxury theater without some of the normal hassles and prices and crowds this may be the place for you. I will frequent this place often I think. As well as try the 21 Greens next door.",QtuzG4-zmGTdB0jSMC54tg,1,1,3,CvWm_3xPNIOq5HZTIAvP2w

Rude and unprofessional! she ended up serving others and when she finally started making the drink our movie was starting!_ALL BAD!! Her name was ski...it wasn't even busy at the bar that's the sad part! Horrible service she really knew how to kill the vibes! I'll give  2stars for our server Tatiana she was pleasant. Food was nasty honestly disappointed! The fries keep on menu but come on we order crab sliders. U give hard hot dog buns with it? Disgusting! Anyhow suggestions movie volume needs to be higher.

So I guess you ask why come here?  The food and drinks are good and reasonably priced. Hubs loves the popcorn.  No kids allowed for evening movies. The service is slow. On our last visit we were here on a night where it was quite busy.  We waited at least a half hour into the movie before we rang for assistance for our food.

5246545,2017-11-20,0,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"If you want a super comfortable and upscale theater, this is a place for you. It doesn't feel like your typical movie theater. Once you purchase your tickets, you'll go upstairs and find a bar on the left and they check your tickets to the right. The bar is very spacious with open windows and you can lounge anywhere you'd like as they have a wide selection of areas to hang out at if you're too early for your movie. 

In the theater, the seats are set up in pairs with a good amount of space between other seats. It has a table top attached for your convenience and you will find utensils, a menu and a button to notify a staff member when you are ready to order. The menu has a variety of food options so you can come hungry, snack or just drink. The seats are recliners and were very comfortable which I absolutely love!

I do have one complaint about my first experience and I hope that this is not common; I ordered my food when the movie started and because I was so focused on the movie which was 2 hours long, I never got my food. I notified the staff but at this point there was only about 15 minutes left of the movie so I just cancelled my order. The attendant in the theater apologized profusely so I can't exactly point out where the error was. I also have a suggestion, please consider serving coffee. My friend and I came here to have a different and awesome movie experience but unfortunately, my first visit did not live up to that expectation. 

Overall, I would still like to consider going back and I hope my circumstances today was a one-off because I do think, as a new business, they have potential to have better service.",HwYm34sdGmfc43o4uHislg,0,0,3,7LnzZjuLDBqIWJ8MTtkWxA

Their theaters are very small and intimate but their guest service is very prompt.  One suggestion is that if you plan on ordering food you do it before the movie begins as you don't wish to see a lot of the Raiders moving about through your movie experience. Not saying that the waiters distract you completely from your movie, as they are very discreet as they move about the theater but it could be distracting. The only drawback for this theater is that there isn't ample parking and the neighborhood that it's okay to din is it the best to be walking around in at night.",yS1kK5EGcwatp6D6hFGvlw,0,0,4,bbksYz90tJGLkcdergUwqw

The reception area was beautiful, with a very friendly and knowledgeable ticket girl at the main desk. She quickly and easily convinced my partner and I to join the rewards program. We were directed up the elevator, where we were greeted by every staff member that we passed in transit. 
Unfortunately, we didn't have time to check out the lounge at the top of the elevator. I saw a balcony area, so I will definitely make sure hat we arrive early enough next time to enjoy them. The lounge looked classy and comfortable all at once. 
The theater itself was amazingly comfortable and I have to say that there is not a bad seat in the house. All are cushy, black leather recliners with swinging trays. The armrest in between them lift up to make a live seat. The chairs are in pairs, and far enough away to give the element of privacy during the show. There is a server and running staff to bring you anything from drinks from the bar to popcorn, and from candy to a full dinner menu, including desserts. 

Their popcorn with sea salt is addictive. And they have Goose Island Sofie - one of my favorite ales. 

The server was polite, accommodating and efficient. She was the only one in the entire theater. She was very helpful.

Located downtown, Eclipse offers a luxury theater experience with reclining seats, in-theater waiters, and a bougey menu. There's also a bar and outdoor patio to lounge around before the movie starts. Speaking of the bar, the BOGO sangria with yelp check-in was an amazing deal! $10 for two hefty sangrias ain't bad at all. 

Tickets are $18 and seats are reserved online or when buying tickets at the box office. There's a small parking garage for guests, too. My husband and I shared an order of fries ($6) and pretzel bites ($9), both of which were tasty.

Movie was suppose to start at 10:30, didn't until at least 10:50 because theatre was not cleaned in time. Seriously poor planning on their part. 
Drinks are small and expensive. Plan on paying about $15 for 3-4 sips. We ordered the Caribbean jerk chicken wings that had absolutely NO FLAVOR! The hamburger sliders were better.
On the positive side, our waitress Alexandria was very sweet and attentive and the seats were comfortable.

They have 2 ticket kiosks at the lobby or you can buy your movie tickets from the person behind the counter or you need human interaction. There is a bar upstairs right before you get to the cinemas. The nights that I've watched a movie here, I didn't see kids which is really nice. It's quiet, peaceful and clean. The place doesn't reek of stale popcorn and the floors aren't sticky. My visits have been pleasant.

The seats are comfortable - they recline and you have lots of legroom and space between you and the person next to you. On your seat would be a drink menu and a food menu. Press the button on your table if you want to place an order. You don't have to worry about long lines at the concessions for your popcorn and drinks. You just wait comfortably and they'll bring your food and beverage to you.

They have sliders, lobster rolls, sweet potato fries, chicken lollipop, deviled eggs, salt and pepper fries, flatbreads, popcorn, deviled eggs, salad cups, ice cream, candy, cake, cobbler, beer, wine, and cocktails. I've only tried the lobster rolls, salt and pepper fries, popcorn (LOL), and sliders. The lobster rolls were bland - I don't recommend and I won't order again.

There was a comfy lounge and bar area before we got to the row of theaters, and if it hadn't been noon, I'm sure we would have partook in a nice relaxing drink or two before the movie. Once we were seated the waitress was very attentive but not intrusive. She actually took the time to build up a report with my wife, which made the experience that much better. We got all our food in a timely manner and it was delicious. The large, leather, power reclining seats were super comfy. The sound system was so good.

I purchased tickets online and they couldn't even tell which theater number we were in. The printed tickets even had a barcode on it, which they never scanned. They even asked if we knew... What, seriously?! So after finally finding the correct theater, come to find out, someone was in our seats. Of course they left it to us to fight for our seats when they should have asked them to move since it is RESERVE SEATING.
On top of all that food/drink service was incredible slow and had to pass other peoples food/drinks to them multiple times during the movie!!!

Parking - there is onsite parking, that was already full forcing us to pay to park in a public lot (not a ton of money but added expense for an already inflated ticket cost).  This parking snafu also caused us to miss the start of the movie.  We arrived 15 minutes early, but by the time we parked and waited in line to pay said parking it took us a half hour!)

Theater - it's not bad, but not what I was expecting either.  It had reclining chairs, which is great and the new trend but nothing new here. The sound system is unimpressive, so don't go here to watch an action movie expecting amazing sound.

Food Menu - nice, but unremarkable.  Think basically theater food that you can order from your seat.  It's also difficult to see the menu in the theater once the movie has started without turning on your cell phone and disrupting everyone else.

Service - the staff was nice enough, but hard to get a hold of.  If you didn't know where the call button was, it's tiny and not immediately obvious.  On top of that service wasn't really fast. This feature was more of a hassle than a help.  

All in all I am leaning to just going to Galaxy or the Downtown Summerlin Regal.  Both have the exact same reclining seats, a good bar, and easy parking.

For three adults and a child, we paid $76 just to go in and see the movie. The recliner seats are average and not as comfortable as recliner seats at other theaters, where tickets are much cheaper.
They do check your bags. Therefore, you cannot sneak any food in. The reason I say this is because their food is absolutely deplorable! They do not have hamburgers, but rather sliders. I ordered the Wagyu sliders, which come with nothing else but three sliders. They were dry and not that good. The pretzel nuggets were boring and average and the sweet potato tots were dry and over fried. Our nine-year-old ordered popcorn which he said was not very good and did not have enough butter. Another friend that came ordered the margarita pizza/flatbread and said it was disappointing. Our nine-year-old also tried their hot chocolate and said it was way too sweet and he did not like it. We tried their tiramisu which was seasonal and it was absolutely awful. We ordered diet Pepsi which came in a large glass that only fit about 250 to 300 mls of liquid as plenty of ice and the only way to get more was to press the button to have them refill it, which did not happen right away. That was annoying.
What was the most annoying is that we were asked to pay for everything close to the end of the movie, while the movie was still going! The waitress put a lit pen with paper right in front of my face even though my friend was paying for it next to me. This was during the climax toward the end of the movie!!!##%%%!!! It completely ruined the movie for us. My friend missed some of the coolest scenes because she had to pay at that time. How stupid! A kindergarten class can run a theater better than this place. Every other theater asks that you pay right away and that's the way it should be. Just completely stupid.
To add, there is nowhere for children to sit and wait to get into the theater. There is a large area/lounge for 21 and over adults that serves alcohol. There is parking under the theater.
Even if I lived in downtown Las Vegas, I would drive and go to another theater. There are many theaters in town with beautiful larger more comfortable recliner seats, cheaper ticket prices, cheaper and better food. Even with gas, it would be cheaper to go to another theater than walk to this theater because of how expensive this theater is.
Our bill for food for four people cost $150 with tip. That's ridiculous! Those sliders for $18!!! Whitecastle would have been better! Once again, the food at this theater was horrible. 
We tried it and we will not be coming back. Way too many other theaters that are better, cheaper, and with way better food.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,2,1,1,sxO9RFO1QFjkyYl6qXjhGw

Little did we know that there was a private event upstairs in the patio and lounge area, to include the bar. There was no signage, nothing. Just a group of 30-50 people dressed in all white with wristbands, we had to wait probably 30 mins before the movie started from walking up and down the aisle to going outside and smoking to kill time, since we couldnt use the patio and the bar area since it was for a special event.

We came to watch Cars 2 because after 6pm, there are no one under the age of 21 allowed in the building. How great is that? We were able to watch the movie in peace without a 4 year old screaming. The service was great, but had some kinks. As we walked to our theater, everyone and their mothers greeted us. It was incredibly welcoming. 

The theater itself had limited seating, and was perfect for an intimate movie with a small crowd. A server arrived at our table within minutes and took our groupon. The drinks are refillable, and all you have to do is press a little button for a server to come and do it. Popcorn was buttered to the max and I just about feinted. I suggest the sliders on the menu.

They have a rewards program that seems to be very generous with comps too.

5716302,2017-07-11,10,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"Absolutely impressive theater, but I won't be giving up my usual cinema for it.  

Before coming here, I thought it was like an upgraded AMC or Galaxy theater with recliners and assigned seating. It's much more.

After getting your ticket and reaching to the second floor, to your left is a classy restaurant with a full bar! But skip it! You can order from your seat and they'll bring it right to you - even during the film.  How it works: your leather recliner has those swivel table tops like you're in study hall, and next to the cup holder is a button that summons a server from which you can order food and drinks off the menu placed on your arm rest. The staff is super kind and orders come out in good time.

Now, with dining distractions Eclipse would probably overlook the theater equipment - wrong.  I love a good, standout cinema house (like the Arclight in L.A. or Alamo Drafthouse in Austin) and if the projection or surround sound quality is not on point, it's annoying like a baby screaming in the seat behind you, spoiling the feature.  No babies here, the picture quality is crisp and for a screening of so few seats, the sound is top quality with great surround and smooth rumbling bass.  And speaking of seats, I was a bit shocked to find my screening room had probably around 20 seats.  Pretty awesome, though sometimes it's neat to share a scare, laugh, or tear with a fellow audience. 

Considering all this cool stuff, and like I said at the top, Eclipse will not replace my usual spot. At an $18 price point for a 4:30pm show, in addition to bland $18 Wagyu sliders and an $8 draft beer, it's a bit out of my price range.  

Cons: $, small audience, $
Pros: privacy, comfort, dining

I love the extra treatment, space, fewer people and the ability to get snacks or drinks in the middle of the movie without missing anything is awesome!  I would prefer with the prices and the ambiance that their housekeeping levels get stepped up from slacking off to top notch. The town I am from had something similar and I never had those housekeeping issues.

The bathrooms could use some TLC: no toilet paper / missing locks / missing paper towels.

Also, I am sorry to say, but this is my 4th time here and the food is just not to my taste; I have ordered several times from their menu and for some reason all of those items were DRENCHED in sugary sauces, whether salad or not. 

Among others, I ordered the ""healthy turkey burger"" and dude - healthy my ass!! There was so much sugar in it I had my husband taste it (he is the one with the sweet tooth so I thought it was just my diabetic ass not feeling it) and he was like ""whoaaaa did they put sugar in this??""... I left it on the plate and stared at it with regret while dinosaurs  screamed in the background (Jurassic world). 

I mean, too bad - if you are going to put BBQ sauce on food items make sure to disclose it in the menu and people will order without it if needed.

Let me start by saying my first experience at this theatre was great! 

My husband and I went on a date to see Black Panther and neither of us have visited the theatre. I mistakenly booked the wrong show online and didn't realize it.  When I showed up at the box office to pick up tix, I was informed I purchased tix for the earlier show. I was livid because I didn't realize the mistake I made but the manager came down and without hesitation, accommodated us and switched the tix to the show that was coming up. Friendly warm and understanding. So grateful! 

It was mid week so the theater was pretty empty. We had time before the show and sat by the bar and ordered drinks. We chatted with the bartender who is very friendly. We also had a chance to look at the menu before our movie. 

The prices I felt were a bit high but the food was definitely worth it. it was kinda worth it. My only issue was that for a non busy day, the bathroom had dirty stalls. There was even a piece of someone's weave on the ground by the toilet which was weird. The rug on the stairs was filthy for a fairly new theatre. Also the lounge area by the bar had stained couches and chairs. Yuk! A little white vinegar diluted in water and a clean rag could easily clean those chairs. If they could keep up with those simple things this place would be 5 star for sure.

THE GOOD:
+ comfy and spacious recliner seats with table top
+ more private because seats are paired
+ sound quality
+ image quality

THE AVERAGE:
~ the food

THE BAD:
- pricing
- server style concessions

I think it's a nice theater, but god, it's SO expensive. If it weren't for the Groupon they have going right now, I definitely wouldn't be choosing Eclipse over my usual spot. It is a super cute place for date night though, especially since it's located so closely to downtown if you want to grab something to eat.

I've had their popcorn and pretzel bites. Popcorn is so yummy because they use real butter (which is always bomb.com), but I'd skip their pretzel bites because I'm not a fan of their sauces. I prefer to have my pretzels with nacho cheese and all it's processed goodness, and unfortunately, I didn't see that on the menu. I'm also not a fan of the service style. It's nice, don't get me wrong. But it also costs more, plus you have to account for tip. And also it can distracting.

Otherwise, totally recommend this place to try at least once. Wouldn't be a regular at full price, and also PRO TIP don't order a water bottle. It's Voss, and I was so sad to part with my $9, I reused that bottle for a week I was so salty.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,7,2,4,feBYGAh2mrAxOATFWRHfMQ

We ordered the Waygu Beef Sliders, the caprese flatbread, and the apple cobbler. These portions were big. Not the small bites I thought from the pictures I saw from other reviewers. I also ordered a cocktail that was very good. The food was not impressive but not bad. There wasn't anything left when the movie was over. They brought all the food out at once so I had to start on my desert first to keep the ice cream from melting. Would have liked for it to come out staggered.

Attentive staff, great food, comfortable seating.  I ordered the lobster roll and was not disappointed.  The large popcorn tasted freshly popped just for me.  My server was quick to get to me when needed.  The seats were plush leather reclining seats and very comfortable.  The theaters are cozy and not too big.  Even the front row is far enough back that you're comfortable.  

The biggest plus is that as of now the theater is only for 21 and over and I hope it stays that way.  At the least I hope all showings after 6pm stay 21 and over. It's truly wonderful to not be around kids, teens on their phones, and adults who think it's OK to drag a baby to a movie.  

It was not perfect.  The parking was difficult.  I don't mind valet but I rarely carry cash and in the age of smart phones with card readers is inexcusable to have a cash only policy.  I left to find an ATM but was lucky to find street parking after exiting the valet. Also about halfway through my movie it got cold in the theater.  Like REALLY cold.  I'm not one to get cold in a movie but this was uncomfortable cold and I heard several other patrons talking about it when the movie ended.  

I'll be back though.  With a blanket.",AgtVmIj-jyOmGZHfY8_JSA,2,1,5,p0En11AvsoVVkSA1qo9LAQ

Got there early enough to have a cocktail before the show; however, the bartenders could only make one drink at a time; the second bartender was (in her surly words) ""was stocking the bar."" I was one of two people trying to order a drink. No smiles; no customer service but expensive drinks. 

Then when we went into the theater, the seats we selected were taken. According to the very nice patrons, they could not find their seats and were placed there. The Eclipse rep said, ""oh yeah, these aren't marked well. I said, ""That is not our problem."" 

Never again. It costs too much to be treated so poorly.",3D1q3mU-31qOuyu75vQlug,0,0,1,zVSGNJKnFusIkzxzCIqPgg

Before movie, I ate and drank at the bar. French fries and Margarita classic. Waitress are kind, talkative and very quick.
Because, the particularity in this movies theater is : ordering during the movie at your seat. But, for being polite and for not being disturbed when I watch movie I have preferred eating before.
I like this Movie theater.",HAdISaU63tVxeGFbNEvLDw,0,0,5,VS6BlbfNm_GY1w0HbPkU2g

However, the food isn't all that great! It's more about the experience. The perfect date night or girls night out especially with the location being downtown you can easily do something fun after a movie.",eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,0,0,4,XGWfPyx7r75VWuLMH1QtTg
5993758,2017-01-29,12,cfggUk66F01Av4YWZJXcnA,"What a great place for a date night! Although it is a bit on the pricey side ($18 per ticket) the upscale, childless atmosphere makes up for it. I mean, who likes to watch a movie they've been dying to see with a screaming kid in their ear? Not me. 

Plus, there is also a full bar/lounge at the entrance to all the theatres, which is nice. If you want to enjoy a cocktail or two before a movie, be sure to arrive early as it seems to stay nice & packed up until closing.

If you don't make it on time to enjoy a pre-movie drink, don't fret - you will receive full service from inside the movie theatre with the push of a call button. In addition to drinks, there is a full menu to order from. You can get everything from bruschetta to lollipop chicken wings, and if you're not feeling ""food"" there's the standard movie popcorn tossed in REAL butter. 

All in all Eclipse provides something the other luxury theatres does not, and on that note well definitely be back!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,27,22,5,EIrARw4GzZVYvBXK9foD2g
