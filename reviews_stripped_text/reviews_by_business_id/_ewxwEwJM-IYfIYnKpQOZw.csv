I had went Sunday 04/23/17 around 8pm that day their was a short Hispanic girl working the register I was giving her my order THREE TIMES I showed her exactly what I wanted which was a ChamoFresa raspado THREE TIMES I POINTED TO WHAT I WANTED & guess what she still gave me the raspado she wanted a plain agua fresa raspado. I also ordered fresas con crema AND GUESS WHAT they forgot to give it to me so by than their was a chubby gentleman working the register I believe he was the manager... After being charged for the dessert they tell me their out of strawberries! I complained to the guy working the register & he told me he could upgrade me to the fruit salad... This whole time he was rolling his eyes at me which is incredibly rude! I asked for my money back on the fresas con crema but on the raspado I got charge twice even though it was their fault! This place is so unorganized!!!! The employees don't listen to what you want & the manager still wants to give you attitude.

Menu includes Mexican street dogs and several snack/dessert options like raspas, ice cream, and prepackaged chips and candies. Convenient for those who want to smuggle in their own concessions to the movies.

Tried the Mexicali Dog, with plenty of toppings. There is also the option to build your own. I was treated to a sample of the vanilla raspa, which was extremely sweet. They do offer spicy versions with chile and tabasco, as well as additional condensed milk and other toppings.

Ownership is very friendly. Interior is small, with two tables for dining in- more of a grab and go kind of spot. Hours are currently unlisted and flexible, but they generally close around 8PM.

The guy who took my order was very helpful and explained to me what all of the vegan options/substitutions were.

I ordered the fruit salad, which is made with fresh strawberries, bananas, vegan cream, granola and topped with vegan whipped cream. The whipped cream actually had more of an ice cream-like texture, which I really enjoyed.

They call it a fruit salad but it definitely comes close to being a parfait. The only difference is that they use a sweet cream instead of yogurt. The strawberries were so delicious! They were big, ripe and fresh! The only thing I'd change would be to add cream to the bottom of the cup before adding the fruit so it's more layered.

Overall I loved it, it was a delicious and refreshing sweet treat! This place is definitely a hidden gem, I'll probably end up being a regular here.",f-Qepve8hGa9mE6YuTPe3w,2,0,5,v0MHiJE7IN_D5MixTKE2bw

It's mid-Jan and FREEZING but I'm still the type that'll holler at a good place for some chamango! It's in the same plaza as the Tropicana Cinemas, and we had to drive around a little bit to find it - but now that I know, it's in my brains GPS. 

Going in, there were two other ladies there and one guy working. It was a little later in the evening so I'm assuming more people are there to run shop when it's peak hours. 

My fiancé and I started looking at the menu, and to be honest I got super overwhelmed with all the options...and I'm practically vegetarian so SHOUT OUT to the multiple items even I could eat. 

We decided to go with the chamango & hot Cheeto esquite....and like I'm about to go right after this review and set myself up for round 2. 

Super thrilled this place is close by.",n9zwrWp8EeB9ODTitKZYsw,0,0,5,q9apQWIqP_4YvqJRvusOlQ

I've been to Mexicali numerous times and i was expecting to live up to Mexicali since they're using the name! I was very disappointed with what I ordered I got the mangonada and chicali oh and also a corn with hot Cheetos dust. They don't use real ice cream not even natural product they use syrups of a variations of flavors! Sadly nothing even compared to Mexicali!!!!!",kb9FCGgHajA54h35kgzUaA,1,0,1,M82kmh9b9yFdE2-b-eMSXA

My friends & I came at night time assuming close to closing time but the cashier (who also made our yummy snacks) was in no rush to get us out at all. Which was super nice. The place is small, maybe 4 tables at the most. But it's clean. The guy was super nice. This is place is a real treat!",eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,2,2,5,3HXdLq_ltZKK0n1qxNWdPg
