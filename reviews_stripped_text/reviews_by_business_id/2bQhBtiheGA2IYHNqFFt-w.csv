young daughter of about 2 was giving out the menus.  I ordered beef curry.  The beef was so tough I could not chew the beef.  The curry sauce was so horrible I could not even eat it over rice.  This had to be the worst Thai food in town.  The restaurant was very dirty and I lost my appetite.  I think the health department needs to pay a visit to
them.  I would recommend to eat at your own risk.

I wanted to also add that my egg roll was drenched in greased when served to me.
I didn't even eat it.

I left 3/4 of my lunch on the table when I left.",LNug3y3P5NzCthoCJiR7jg,0,0,1,_qO0ZAxI1vgEWMQG1xho1A

I also ordered the Sesame Fried Chicken which resembled a hot wing with sesame seeds on it. I don't like hot wings so I wasn't crazy about this dish. I was expecting it to be crispy little pieces of chicken with no sauce so I was disappointed. 

 I did love my main dish though.  The Red Beef  Curry had tons of bamboo chutes in it which was yummy. This is the first place where I see that they prepare their dish this way. I would come here just for the Curry! The fried bananas were also delicious and worthy of a second visit!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,1,3,6uoWZGqyQ6VzNjlAAnnfMw
