1074186,2016-02-05,0,-_TSaVr53qiEGqMkwyEMaQ,"This is an amazing new Mediterranean fast food restaurant - Chipotle/Subway style of ordering. 

The place is well decorated, clean, modern and there's good radio (hits) music playing (not the greek or arabic music you hear at other places).

The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is self service. The prices are super low. A small chicken wrap is $6.49 and the regular (their large) is $7.99. And the small one is not small at all.

And you get to choose your meat and veggies and sauces like you do at Subway. Unlike most other places who only offer tge thicker pita bread, here they have the thinner one, which I like better. You can also choose white or wheat bread.

I got a regular white chicken shawarma wrap with  ther vegy salad which is amazing and added parsley (hey, it's their name), garlic spread and tzatziki sauce. They'll ask you if you want hummus, but I told them no, and got the tzatziki instead of the hummus - so it's your choice, and I recommend you donthe same. Tzatziki sause is basically a dill yoghurt sauce used for wraps and pita breads, and in my opinion goes better with the chicken shawarma. Chicken shawarma is rotisserie grilled chicken on a typical Mediterranean rotating grill and is cut in small pieces. The wrap was amazing. The chicken is fresh and tasty. They do season it slightly and it tastes amazing. 

I also tried their home made ""special recepie"" cucumber chiller drink  ($1.99). It's very refreshing, try it!

Chicken Bowl
Chicken Plate
Chicken Salad
Chicken Kabob Bowl
Chicken Kabob Plate
Chicken Kabob Salad

No explanations below any of those. They only seem to have a grill. So what's the difference between ""Chicken"" and ""chicken kabobs?"" You'll have to ask. And they didn't seem to have much of an answer other than when i asked it to say, ""oh, ok. chicken kabob."" and put it on the grill. So I still have no idea how the ""chicken"" is different. I asked about the bowl or plate. Or on a napkin? I ordered the chicken salad. My friend ordered the bowl. The only difference was the addition of rice to the exact same dish. Assembled exactly the same way. When I'm tired and hungry, I don't have a lot of excess patience to try to figure out what you are trying to sell me. As for the chicken itself, they put it on the grill for a LONG time. I expected it to be way overcooked and dry. But it wasn't. It was perfectly cooked. The beef didn't come out as well.

I waited about that amount of time until she called me up to build my bowl. When I got home I took one bite and felt rubbery uncooked chicken in the center of one of the chicken cubes. I went through and shredded them all to see which ones were edible and ended up throwing away about half which was unfortunate because I was hungry.

There were four of us, and we tried four different things. The beef and chicken curries is what I got, as well as pita chips and hummus. The curries are amazing, and the hummus is very good. It doesn't take top spot for best I've had, but it's definitely ranked very very highly. That was quite surprising for me, as this is basically Chipotle for Mediterranean food. I didn't expect hummus this well executed from a place like that.

Rather than simply apologize for the employee error and send me on my way, she literally remade the whole salad in the smaller container wasting my previous lunch time, her staff's time, and a perfectly fine side salad.

Menu can be confusing for first-timers: mostly a Chipotle-style setup, with some featured dishes and specials. Wish menu was more clear about what ingredients come in what dish by default, so you know what you're adding on or omitting, but staff are generally good about walking you through the steps.

The hummus bowl is a favorite, chicken preferred, especially if you want high-protein. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to keep well for takeout/reheating. The wraps are easily shareable, or enough for multiple meals- pack yours with everything you want, staff miraculously always manage to make it close! Don't forget the feta and tabouli. Salads are decent but not my favorite, falafel is inconsistent (at times dry inside and/or oily outside).

Staff I've encountered are typically polite, informative, and efficient. I like how serving spoons for feta, tabouli, etc are regular, full-size spoons rather than the stingy measuring spoons I encountered on my visit to the other location referenced above and you are only charged for additional toppings (ie more than one serving)... or at least, that's my experience.

-Hummus creamy, smooth texture and has great flavor
-The Parsley Nachos (so bomb) crispy, crunchy not greasy pita chips top with their yummy shawarma steak, feta cheese, onion, cucumber that adds a nice chill, other goodies and tzatziki sauce from the Gods! I highly recommend ordering this!

 First impression- Inside of the restaurant was done greatly. The setup is familiar to something you would see at chipotle,the lines were clean and it was open & modern. Chipotle style menu, but Mediterranean and better .There's also additional seating outside, but that's if you can find a table, if it's not occupied by the overflow loiterers from Starbucks next door. 

The taste - I ordered the Red Quinoa Salad with shawarma chicken, that also came with pita bread . Since this was my first visit, the lady behind the counter explained everything in full detail and recommended the salad that I chose... She said it was perfect for post gym training . 

I also ordered the cucumber chiller, it reminded me of an aguas fresca. It was very tasty. The salad was plentiful it included the following: salad, chickpeas, quinoa, chicken, feta,  tzatziki and I added carrots.  The flavor profile was very good . Everything was fresh and filling . I had leftovers . 


Overall - Service was friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and filling and not overly heavy. Establishment was clean inside and outside . I give it 5/5

It's sort of like a Mediterranean skin of Chipotle. But higher standards, loving and alive.

As I was choosing my toppings I could see she was getting frustrated with me.  Like I was inconveniencing her.  She started having this terrible attitude as to tell me hurry the _ _ck up.  

When she was done making my bowls I asked for the extra chili sauce on the side.  This is a sauce that comes on the bowl.  And it's a sauce I've asked for extra on the side many times.  It's a sauce that people come up to the counter and just ask for when they want more of.  

So she looks at me and with a rude tone says, ""ya but I'm gonna charge u for it!""  I was so shocked by how she said it, I just nodded.  She ended up charging me a dollar for a miniature plastic cup of sauce.  Crazy!

Not so much that you want to kill yourself afterwards, but bf and I were struggling to finish our bowl and wrap. After trying out Halal Guys a few weeks ago with an underwhelming outcome, we were glad we came here. I don't even really like chicken, but the chicken here is very tender and moist, not dry at all. And compared with Halal Guys, you get a real salad that's already dressed, and many other free toppings such as red cabbage, onions, parsley, tomatoes, tzatziki or tahini, spicy sauces, etc, and some extra charge toppings. For the most part, the extra charge toppings are on the left side, free toppings on the right.

We also got a beef wrap and the lavash bread is so good! They make it a point to tell you it's not a tortilla, and I think I remember the owner saying they make it thenselves, though not sure if that's true. Anyway it was good.

They have two hot sauces here. Not as hot as the red sauce at Halal Guys (thank god!) but even their green mild sauce has a nice kick to it. But honestly, unless you are one of those people that have to have hot on everything, the food here doesn't really need anything more.

If you're unsure of what to order, ask for a sample. They will most likely try to give you a sample of something anyway.

Without the Groupon, most entrees are about $9-10, but it will be a very filling meal. No need to add on a side unless you are sharing an entree. Usually we try to not overeat, but we can put away quite a bit when we want to. We ate until the point of fullness, but then there wasn't enough leftover for it to make sense to take home, so we ended up powering through and finished it all.

It came with rice and mediterranean salad. The marinated carrots (sure they name but forgot) that was star that never expected. The carrots had amazing depth of flavor with the seasoning on it and just refreshing carrots stick could munch on all day. The chicken once cooked was tasty. It was cooked perfection nice and moist/hot on the inside. The sauce on top perfect compliment round out the flavor of the chicken. The plate also comes with warm pita bread.

It's not that it was bad....it was just meh..
With the exception of The Steak Shwarm-they should rename it overcooked splinters of fatty meat that fell through the grill grates. Horrible.
The tzasiki and hummus are strictly a matter of my personal taste...but there was a light at the end of the tunnel and that was the baklava! D-lish!
I will also note that we ordered delivery so maybe this was the reason the fries were soggy and lukewarm though my Dad liked them.

2) Mixture/Sample plate- Got pita, salad- which I asked to substitute for rice but then was told that i had to pay another 1.50 for this substitution, feta, hummus, olives, babaganoosh 
-hummus was super garlicy- just the way i like it- very cream and quite a large serving
- feta was very salty
-olives were in olive oil and very tasty- about 6-7 served
- Babaganoosh was excellent- wish i got more
3)Hummus Shawarma Bowl- chicken grilled with salad, hummus and pita (whole wheat)
4) Cucumber house drink- was highly recommended but i couldnt stand the taste

He didn't know if he could do it. He asked another worker and the worker said it was okay to do so. He still didn't understand me. He gave me a salad with no rice. Then gave me rice with meat and no salad. Then tried to combine both rice plates into one when I asked for two separate. If you're confused by now, this was how I felt too. I don't know how else to simply state i wanted two plates with the meat and rice separate from the salad. Please train your workers or at least have more workers working. Placing an order especially in an assembly line type restaurant like this one should not have to take 10 min especially with me being the only person there!

Food was mediocre. I've had better Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. The chicken schwarma was way better than the beef in my opinion. It was more moist.

3014748,2016-12-18,2,-_TSaVr53qiEGqMkwyEMaQ,"After waking up late on a crisp winter Saturday I felt no desire to cook let alone make a single cup of coffee. Instead I headed to Starbucks which took longer to get to than making a cup of coffee. However, you rarely consider those details when crafting a laziness inspired plan. 

I arrived at the good ole, overpriced, over roasted, push button coffee preparation establishment aka Starbucks and picked up my drinks. Luckily these were compliments of Visa and didn't come out of my pocket. Thank you Visa. 

After taking a a few sips of the very strong cold brew my stomach quickly protested by aching. It was hungry and seeing that I hadn't fed it in 18 hours the coffee was making sure I didn't forget about its current state of emptiness. Enter Parsley the modern Mediterranean restaurant conveniently next door. I quickly read a few reviews and decided that 4.5 stars for a suburban eatery is typically worth checking out. 

Once inside I approached the counter and bluntly asked the smiling woman to ""school me"" as I'd never been there and really just wanted a gyro. A sandwich made with lamb or steak, lettuce, tomato, feta cheese and cucumber yogurt dressing all contained within a warm and delicious pita bread. However, this gem of a meal wasn't on the menu. I don't really understand why as a well prepared Gyro can bring a tear to my eye. I wonder if a Gyro is really a low brow type of sandwich that higher end places avoid. I don't know. 

After getting a sample of their steak and chicken I promptly chose the steak. 
 
The steak bowl which came with a generous bed of lettuce, a healthy serving of yellow #5 rice (I'm sure it was natural, albeit blinding yellow). Atop the rice was what looked to be 4-5 ounces of delicious steak followed by dressing of your choice. My choice was cucumber yogurt which again was very good. For an additional dollar which is my only complaint, you could get feta cheese, extra dressing, olives and a few other items. They are so generous with the portions you'd think they continue that over to the items you pay extra for. Nope!! I got approx, 12 cents worth of feta and I'm not talking about retail pricing. It's almost as bad as Subway charging so much extra for a quarter of an avocado. (It's an avocado, not rare caviar!)

Well, despite the peasant serving of feta I sat down and thoroughly enjoyed my whole meal. I chose 5 stars because the food is really well prepared, the staff is friendly, the restaurant was super clean and well decorated. The cheese did impact my opinion but I can't let it take a star away and potentially steer some 5 star snob away from this place.

The staff has been friendly and while the appetizers have been good, both times I have been extremely disappointed with the steak schwarma.  It is cooked on an gyro machine and the way the sheer it off, much of the meat is either overcooked or contains a great deal of fat and grissle.  The dressing used on the salad is good but as it is prepared and tossed in advance, it breaks down quickly with the lettuce losing its texture and both wilting and browning. Quality could easily improve by preparing fresh during slower periods as opposed to using what was left over from the dinner rush.  At 16 bucks for the combo with appetizer and drink, it felt quite expensive for the lack of quality and there are many alternatives. With better food preparation and attention to what is served, Parsley could certainly excel. Three stars for friendly service and good appetizers.

Ya know how a lot of places ask you if you'd been there before, and if not, they'll explain it to you. Not at Parsley.

I went with the steak bowl, and moving down the line felt like I should've thrown my wallet over the counter and walked away. You want extra meat? $3-$4. Extra sauce? That'll cost the you a buck.

It's set up like Chipotle in that you select the toppings/protein as you order. You can get a bowl, wrap, salad, or plate. It moves slower than the typical place that's set up like this but I think it's because you have more options. If there's a rush, you might have to wait awhile. 

Everything I've tried here has been very good. I usually get the chicken plate with rice and salad. Best parts IMO are the tzatziki sauce and hot sauces.

Only two things I'd like to point out as constructive criticisms...the music was too loud- we had to talk to the folks on the other side of the counter to navigate our way through our first time and between the music and kitchen equipment I felt like I was shouting. The other thing was the side of chips I ordered. I chose not to get the combo which could have included chips, because I didn't know what quite what to expect with the Hummus Shwarma Bowl I ordered but after I started eating realized I should have gotten the combo...I needed those chips :) I went to the counter and ordered them. There was some discussion behind the counter about how to ring them up and the verdict for a small side of chips was $3.

This, was about the worst I've had yet. The chicken and beef Shwarma plates included salad (your choice on veggies for the salad and VERY dry rice that seemed as if it sat out all day. You could get hummus, which is extra and olives (extra). The meats were appearing to look as if they were either leftover pieces sitting on the bottom of where they cut and slice the meats. Both, the beef and the chicken were ULTRA dry, piled in a cluster. The chicken had a weird smell to it and the pieces (literally small crumb-like pieces) were just not appetizing at all. Even with drowning it in sauces or dips, it had a weird flavor to it. Both, were utterly disappointing as I was excited to try this ""modern"" twist. I can't understand what made it so modern? Perhaps the fact that they don't do any kind of ""Gyros"" and serve choices on Baguette's instead? I ended up picking at the salad. The olives were extremely salty. The rice was too dry and the Baklava couldn't even save this meal. Total disappointment.",LIGbEv_xHXgL_GhpS7EIbg,0,0,2,qXmk4log67Ps7nWeomKD0Q

Super accommodating for vegans and vegetarians.  Plenty of meat lover choices as well. Everything is made fresh daily and you can taste it. I ordered a falafel bowl and was pretty pumped when I saw the staff prep and fry them fresh in front of me. It was also a great size for the price. I ended up taking half to go. I recommend the spicy little carrots to nibble with your meal. The line flow was nice and easy. The overall cleanliness and chill ambiance makes this spot a 5 star for a hangry lady like myself.

So, I wanted to try their chicken kabob plate and come back for their cucumber chiller which was pretty good.

But as we walked in, the male hispanic employee behind the counter did not even smile nor greet us. He asked what we would like in a cold and bored tone of voice. I told him I wanted the chicken kabob plate and a regular beef wrap.  As he started to prepare our wrap, he asked if it was for here or to go. When I said it was for to go, he rolled his eyes as if it was an extra effort to get a to go box which was just placed underneath the counter. But I ignored his arrogance and continued to pick the sides I wanted with my order.

Then I saw him plating my chicken ""kabob"" order and instead of it being a kabob, he put in the shredded chicken that is used on wraps. So, of course I reiterated my order. He then picked off the shredded chicken off with his bare hands and said, ""it will be another 15 minutes if you get the chicken kabob"". At this point, i was so disgusted with this guy's attitude and told him to cancel that order and I would just pay for the steak wrap. Rather than apologizing for not getting my order right, he then proceeded to shake his head and told me it was messed up as they have already prepared the order. 

To make the long story short, I walked out of there with my steak wrap and told him I did not care whether it took hours to prepare my other order because I will not pay for it after the rude gesture and unsanitary circumstances that he just displayed.

It is a shame that in spite of how good your food may be, or how nice your restaurant is, one bad employee can drive away customers. So, to the owner of this restaurant, you might want to send this employee for further training on how to deliver good customer service and sanitation. He brings negative vibe to your business and clearly shows he does not like his job!

We'd pass by this place many times on our way to the gym, so I was excited to try it! When we first walked in, I noticed how clean the place was. The bathroom was nice and the toilet paper was thick and soft, which is surprising for a fast food type place. Furthermore, the service was good except the guy who was handling our order was in a rush and made our order wrong... But it's okay. The dinner rush can be rough when there's a lot of people coming by for dinner! 

FOOD: Imagine a Chipotle style food bar where you tell the associate what you'd like. I had the falafal bowl and my husband has the steak bowl. The food was okay. The falafal was cripsy. I added the hummus in my bowl, which was tasty. BEWARE - the green mild sauce is pretty spicy! The red hot sauce just taste hot and lacks flavor. The steak lacked taste. I believe there are better Mediterranean places around town to try with better food and service. 
If you check-in, you get a free dessert. They baklava was small. We got the almond one, which was okay. 

PRICE: For our two bowls and the free dessert it was around $20, which is fair. The portions was pretty big and I had to take half of it home so it was great value. 

Overall, I give it a 3-star since everything was okay. I probably would not come back though.

They have the meat up on rotisserie spinners and they carve it off fresh to order. You basically pick from a bowl or wrap. I picked the bowl with both steak and chicken.
Large portion with lettuce, garbanzo beans, cabbage and rice. The meat has great flavor and moist all the way through.
You can also add a variety of dressings, spiced compotes, cheese, and veggies. I had the green and red compotes and both were pretty spicy but really good. The tzatki cream cucumber dressing was a great compliment to the bowl.

Parsley is clean, casual, and staffed with super friendly employees. Service has always been exceeded my expectations for a laid back spot like this. 

I saw my friend Jamie P. had written about the steak bowl in her review so I decided to try it out. It was so good, definitely my favorite item to order. The pita bread here is not my favorite,  and on my last visit the hummus was on the watery side, which is never a good sign.

The male server was helping someone in front of him at the time.  There's a lady waiting behind me.  When the male server was done, I don't know how this happened but it did, he skipped over me and went to ask the lady behind me ""how can I help you?""   I was in shock, and didn't say anything at the time because I can't believe what just happened.  Did this guy really skipped over me?

I told them I was on my lunch break and would not have time to wait for my order to be prepared, so they offered to make it and deliver it to me!

Something went wrong and they went above and beyond to make it right.
I ordered the Chicken Shishkabob Plate, which came with their yellow rice and a pretty large side of salad.  The chicken was moist and had excellent flavor.  The rice was also very good.  The tzatziki dressing for my salad was great too.  I also got a side of hummus for $3.99 and some grape leaves for an added $1.00 The hummus was delicious and the grape leaves were awesome!  I only wish I would've gotten more than 2 pieces of pita bread, so I could've eaten all of my hummus.
The bonus desserts were a small triangle of baklava that was sweet w/ the perfect amount of syrup and crunch from the filo, and what I believe is a kourabiedes w/ some sort of chewy/nutty center (I had never seen this before, I even had to google it) which was absolutely delicious!

Then she told me my total was $15.16 and I gave her my Groupon which is worth $16. She scan the Groupon and then she goes you owe me $1.36 more after tax. And I go I'm confused you told me the grand total was $15.16 and now after I show you the Groupon you want to add more tax? I think she was upset that I used a Groupon but the ladies before me used groupons too. So I gave her my debit card to charge the $1.36 (tax according to her) and she goes you don't have cash? And I'm like no and then she hands me back my debit card without charging me the $1.36  and just walks completely away from me. So I took my to go food and went home.

A large, confusing menu.. Here's the gist of it though: choose your meat (chicken/steak/kabobs/vegetarian) and how you want it (bowl, plate, wrap, or salad). Bowls include salad, rice, & meat and spicy pickles carrots. Add on items such as other salads or toppings are $1 extra. Plates are like bowls, but the items are just separated.. Other options are available too, like chicken curry or baguette sandwiches. Add about $2-4 to get a drink and a side like parsley fries or hummus. 
After an explanation of the menu by the nice owner, my boyfriend settled on a steak bowl and me a chicken bowl. We had a tzatziki sauce on our bowls, which looked beautiful! 
The taste was a tad disappointing though. I expected a stronger flavor from the tzatziki. Meats were lacking in flavor and quite dry, but hopefully that's because we came in late at night. The dish needed something more flavorful. The parsley fries were the star- crunchy skin and soft inside.

I scheduled delivery for 2:15 and the party started at 2:30. I even called that morning to confirm the order. I called them at 2:45 and could not get anyone to pick up. I had to call at least seven times before anyone answered. By then, all of the guests had arrived. Thankfully we ordered pizza for the kids.

It was cold and everyone had filled up on pizza. They threw in a big bag of STALE baklava to ""make up"" for their mistake.

I was hoping for a call from the owner, but never got one. I tried to reach out to her the following Monday with no luck.

My go to is the chicken shish kebab or the beef is really good too. It takes longer to cook because it's cooked on a skewer on the grill fresh made to order, and the other kind of chicken and beef is shaved off a rotating skewer so it's less fresh. Plus it's the same price and the quality is much better with the skewer, in my opinion. If you order it in bowl form, which is the best way to get it, they put rice salad any extra veggies you want and the meat of your choice. It is a huge portion and always gets me full. It's also pretty healthy. I like to add kalamata olives and babaganoush (roasted eggplants with the consistency similar to hummus). Also Each add on is around a dollar which is totally worth it!

5097150,2017-01-01,5,-_TSaVr53qiEGqMkwyEMaQ,"After eating holiday food for 2 weeks, mostly sweets & high-fat fare, I was craving a fresh, healthy meal. Thank you Yelpers for turning me on to Parsley. And thank you Groupon for offering me a good deal. 

It's New Year's Day lunch & this place is pretty busy with a nice healthy vibe. Quite a few folks eating outdoors, large to-go orders heading out the door & always a couple people in line waiting to order. Maybe these customers have been ignoring good food, too, & have made resolutions?

This was my first time here & it was fun because Groupon ""made me"" get $16 worth of food-way more than I'd normally order. I ordered the Falafel Plate ($7.99) which came with 6 nice size falafel patties, salad, rice, a pita & tzatziki sauce. The falafel was delicious, as good as any I've ever had, & so was the chunky sauce. Salad was fresh as can be & plentiful & included chickpeas for a nice touch. I was asked if I wanted more of any of the ingredients added (no charge) & I added more tomato & cucumber. I also ordered a side of taboulli (or shall I just call it ""parsley"" because there was almost no bulgar to be found) & one of falafel ($3.99 each side). I think next time I'll just order a side of falafel with a couple of $1 toppings. (See my falafel pic.) 

So the food was good but the ordering was just a bit complicated for the first time, trying to figure out what is what & what goes with what. (Like the Bowl & Plate are exactly the same except how they're arranged on the plate. Really?) The set-up is like Chipotle's but with lots more decisions to be made.

After placing my order I got caught up in looking at all the food toppings & mix-ins & sides & before I realized it 10-15 minutes had passed without my food in sight. I had originally figured the frying of the falafel was responsible for the delay so I asked & they asked me to repeat my order. How could they forget about someone in a line-up like Chipotle's? They did. I was feeling like a road block for the people behind me who had to pass me to get their food before me.

I'll definitely go to Parsley again but I won't get the taboulli nor a meal that includes that rice.

Like many Las Vegas Restaurants, Parsley Modern Mediterranean began with the passion of immigrants, a man from Israel and his British wife originally meeting in Southern California before coming to Sin City and opening their first outpost in 2011, a second on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard added in 2015 and both continuing to operate under a business model based on tradition, affordability and healthiness.

Originally envisioned in the form of a Mediterranean Street Food stand back in Los Angeles, the concept reshaped into a quick-casual Restaurant with a focus on bold flavors featuring all-natural ingredients upon opening the first location on South Pecos, it was Saturday evening around Six o'clock that a visit was paid to Parsley Modern Mediterranean #2 on West Tropicana Avenue, the narrow space about 2/3 full with kids on their way to EDC as well as a couple of local families while two women and a man worked the counter.

Described by one fan as a ""Greek Chipotle,"" and favored by a respected local Chef as one of his go-to spots for healthy food, patrons approaching the counter at Parsley are directed to the end furthest the door in order to place an order, the idea a fairly simple one with three Proteins plus Falafel offered as everything from Bowls to Pitas or Platters, several traditional Dips and Side Dishes also available along with Baklava and Fountain Soda.

Fairly light in décor, a few Bookshelves and a mounted rack of Mediterranean Spices the only ornamentation aside from reclaimed wood and tile, it was after some perusal that the decision was made to order as wide a variety as possible with a focus on tasting, a bit of strategy allowing one to taste four Dips, a salad and two of the four 'Entrees' plus Dessert for under eighteen dollars.

Serving many of the traditional Foods one might expect to find at their local Greek restaurant, everything but the Panini-press warmed Pita Bread made in house daily, it was with 80% of the order in hand that a table was found directly across from the register, first bites of the spit-roasted Chicken noteworthy thanks to not only the juicy texture but also a bold hint of Herbs, the Hummus atop which it was situated a substantial portion dusted in Paprika and Parsley with tangy Tzatziki added at the end.

Taking a chance to unwrap the Pita, a second look at the menu later indicating that Parsley does indeed offer a housemade version for $1.00 more per piece, suffice it to say that the store-bought version does little to detract or add to either the smoothly pureed Chickpeas with a hint of Garlic or the smoky Babaganoosh bright with Lemon and Cumin while the Eggplant Salad is cool, slick and refreshing with thick-cut roasted chunks tossed in Tomatoes, Olive Oil and Peppers.

Told that the $3.99 side of six Falafel was owner Ygal's family recipe, the effort to fry them fresh appreciated even though the flattened shape led to a large surface area and thus a bit too much Oil, those who do not eat Meat are encouraged to taste the light green fritters for themselves with or without Tahini while anyone not on a diet would and without allergies would do well to finish with a small slice of Baklava available in many shapes, the traditional square featuring innumerable layers of Phyllo wrapped around ground Nuts and soaked in Honey. 

****A nearly perfect idea when accounting for location, nutrition, ingredients and price, Parsley Modern Mediterranean is the sort of idea America should be embracing instead of the suddenly 'clean' Panera or 1,000+ calorie Burritos, the menu well-culled and highly customizable with almost everything offered naturally low in fat and available by request without any added Oil.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,9,4,Ca4Ed_4SSCoU7kUPtaCa2g

Taco Bell?), Wingstop (too heavy), Qdoba (aka the Fredo of fast food Tex-Mex) and Denny's (no, not drunk yet), Parsley is nothing short of a freakin goldmine.  I'm not sure people even do lunch at the Starbucks next door, but I kinda feel bad if they do.

The shawarma (chicken or beef) here is pretty good.  Shaved right off the vertical spit as I hungrily watch...on pita, in a salad, on vanilla ice cream, or simply just placed hot on my bare hand,  I'll take it any which way they'll give it to me.  I only wished they offered lamb, but can't imagine that would be a very popular order on West Tropicana and Decatur.  

I do takeout every time, since lunch is usually a mob scene, and rely on Yelp's Eat24 app to place the order.  My food is ready about 70% of the time I walk through the door and if it isn't, the super friendly staff get to it as soon as possible.  There have been a couple of times where they don't receive a notification at all, but I'll notch that up to the Eat24 employees being on their rice break.    

A few other things:

- I really like their spicy, pickled carrots, which can be added at no charge.  The chicken shawarma salad, tzatziki sauce and carrots all in one bite kind of tastes like an exotic buffalo wing.  No, I am currently not on drugs.  
- They claim to have the best falafel in Las Vegas; I'd say it's a solid top 3 with Cleo still being my favorite.  
- I've had fantasies of ripping the top off the fountain drink machine of their homemade cucumber chiller, picking it up, and drinking straight from it.  It's a very tasty and refreshing beverage.

I love the inside- it's decorated well and I love the tables and chairs. Also outside seating too which is where we usually sit. 

Prices are totally decent and they have a great variety. You can choose a bowl, salad, sandwich... It's chipotle style but with fresh Mediterranean style food.

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for about a year now and am so glad I did! Parsley is served ""Chipotle Style"" aka, you pick your meat (Chicken or Shawarma,) you pick your style (Wrap/Bowl/Salad) and then you build accordingly. 

The line clipped along quickly for it being lunch hour; about 15 minutes from wait time to checkout and although I'm not much of a ""salad for lunch"" kinda girl, I ate about half and was perfectly full. Not only that, it was absolutely delicious! The lettuce was crisp, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the topping all looked (and tasted) fresh! I was a little hesitant to try their baklava, primarily because it often tends to be too dense and syrupy, but theirs was a great combination of flaky, sweet and crunchy.

If you have enough forethought, you can also order ahead for pick up through their app! 

This is such a quick, healthy, affordable alternative dining option that I know I will be back. The fact that I could eat a filling meal for less than $10.00 (and feel good about my choice) is awesome. The fact that I could make their bowl into two meals instead of one makes me do a happy dance.

I ended up getting the half chicken half steak burrito. My first bite in, I could really taste the freshness. I also ordered pita chips which were TO DIE FOR!!! The spices and crispiness to it made it soo yummy. I checked in and actually receive two free desserts instead of just one. So I chose the normal baklava and the chocolate w nuts. Overall, great experience. The staff was really nice and caring!",9xmCZ8OA1aPUsSys6SsMpQ,0,0,5,wJmiPAMzJpNTawaEWzKskg

Tzatziki, hummus, pita chips, baguettes, falafel, and chicken over rice all tasted good. The beef salad with all the fixing is delicious. Make sure you use a Groupon discount, $18 for 2x$16 coupons. Then it will be worth it. Without the discount, I think it's a bit expensive with all the great food around Vegas at great prices. Let's hope it stays competitive.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,1,4,3hZcdzgdNy64nDzpWojx3Q

Service is friendly and accommodating. My favorite menu items include the salads, wraps and Mediterranean nachos when I don't mind being bad.

There are often Groupons available if you are looking for a deal. They have many healthy options at a reasonable price.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,14,4,cb0B5lbeUejugIydJYtSpQ
5972436,2016-07-29,0,-_TSaVr53qiEGqMkwyEMaQ,"I was really excited to try this place as I love Mediterranean food.  Initially it looked very good.  I ordered a Steak Schwarma Salad and a Chicken Schwarma Wrap as I wanted to try both.  Order process was not too smooth and the employees seemed overworked, nervous and not very happy.  It was disappointing they didn't have any fresh brewed iced tea to drink.  I spent over $20 on lunch and they gave me a water glass that looked like the tiny cups the dentist gives you to spit in between drilling.  I ended up going back and forth to fill it up at the soda machine and it kept putting a little red punch drink in my water which didn't enhance the lunch experience.  My food looked great and I was happy the worker measured the meat out in a cup so they are consistent on what they give you.  Upon trying the Schwarma both were without any flavor.  I was super disappointed because the reason I love Mediterranean food so much is the bold flavors.  The lettuce was extremely disappointing as it also had no flavor.  They need to add some Vinegar, Garlic, Lemon, something to give it a dressing that takes your breath away but it was just sprayed with oil.  I had them add their spicy sauce when going through the line and I enjoyed it but without that both meats were flavorless.  The Hummus was surprisingly excellent.  The Tzatziki sauce and the Tahini sauce were also dead upon arrival.  I would give this place a 2 on food and 1 on service and friendliness so I am giving it a 2 rating.",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,1,0,2,zfgD23Qudkj6ebmxbnu1KQ

Food: It's Iike the Mediterranean version of Chipotle which is sheer genius. You can make your salad, plate (rice on the side), or bowl (rice and salad together) here. The notable things to get is beef or chicken shawarma but you can also choose wraps, shawarma and hummus, and even curry. 

My favorite thing to get is the chicken shawarma plate with salad on the side and hummus for an extra $1. If you haven't tried their shawarma, now's the best time to get it. It's juicy, tender, and straight up delicious to the taste buds. You can see them shaving it off as it's slowly roasted which gives it a nice touch. Pair it with hummus, and I can't think of any other way to heighten the flavors. 

I'be also tried the curry but I wasn't a fan of it. Nothing notable about the flavor but the saltiness of it. Which reminds me, is their authentic curry in Mediterranean food? I don't think so, but correct me if I'm wrong. 

Service: I'm not a fan, honestly. They never smile, and they always look stressed out. If you can look passed the service, I think you could enjoy the food, but for the most part, think fast food service. They're probably want you out of their face ASAP. 

Overall, I would come back. It's delicious, fast, and probably a healthy option under a few circumstances.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,4,3,4,NPUwiIznPWgkZABiBU96iA
