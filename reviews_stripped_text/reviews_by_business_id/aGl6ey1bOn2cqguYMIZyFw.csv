1121224,2015-05-29,1,aGl6ey1bOn2cqguYMIZyFw,I tried this tiny restaurant run by a family with the grandfather in the back cooking (and sometimes coming out to take orders). It's truly a mom and pop place and I think only Latinos go there. The chile verde was good. The beans were cold and the rice was OK. The tortillas tasted stale and I didn't finish eating them. The service was fairly good. It would be a good idea to speak Spanish if you go to this place.,y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,0,0,3,AhKyxAtVdGwZz3Ri775hDg

The staff is always really friendly every time I stop by and make sure I feel welcomed. Give this place a try, you won't regret it! Ps: don't forget to pick up the housemade green sauce for the tacos!",GE6Amb4sSvxvjxvv_vvKPg,0,1,5,5WjABLiLPX8Pyc3zHRbS-A

They leave the back door into the kitchen open, sometimes all day & night, to a filthy back alley where the garbage is kept without even a screen door or air wall! There's bugs, rats, pigeon poop, dirt & dust coming right in to their kitchen & onto the work surfaces and into the food! This is a health code violation & is very unsafe. When the garbage trucks come into that back alley to pick up the garbage, all the dirt, dust, debris, & germs are stirred up and blow right into their kitchen! Check it out for yourself, I'll bet their back door is open right now! It's disgusting. 
  If you value your health & family's health,  DON'T EAT THE FOOD! It's not safe.",MoAPAU2Pm-ftyglImVptWA,2,0,1,flFbDi26OgpijdS6jOSQsA

They used to be for me, the best tacos around in Las Vegas.  But now the person who makes them is someone new and the tacos are no longer good .
I ordered some tripe tacos and they were undercooked and super soggy.  The tongue tacos were hard.  Which means the tongue was undercooked.  It's very sad that they went from being the best to being the worst.  I left them with 2 stars because their other food is ok.


I have only had tacos from here.  This is a restaurant but at night they also sell tacos outside.  I don't know if they do this during the week or only the weekends.  I have always gone on weekends.  This is one of my favorite taco spots in Las Vegas along with Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. My husband also loves these and he is soo picky with his food.  The meats have soo much flavor and are tender.  They have a condiment section and you can add any of the selections on your tacos.  They have a green salsa that is very good but super spicy.  The first time I had it my nose was soo runny lol.  I hope you guys give this place a try!",s03Hbpkhb2uklGs9y6k9DQ,1,1,2,qWBU5a0-hPt3piX3yw6LxQ

I guess I am adventurous and enjoy meals cooked by the people who are really from the dish's origin. Well the chili verde plate I had was nothing short of spectacular. The pork was about the tenderest most flavorful ever. If you want an adventure, step out and give this one a try. I liked it a lot! It will really help if you Spanish is above average.",3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,2,0,5,mcTyIqhvRkVDSXA8md6PIw
