They have 13kinds of sushi burritos that you can choose from and also they have an another option for create your own poke bowls. Some customers were choosing bowls and those looked good to me but I really wanted to try some sushi burritos because I have never tried any before and got so interested in. 

I ordered #1 original burrito as the staff recommended and oh Yea! the burrito tasted so good as Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon were very fresh and all inside of the burrito matched up with the original poke sauce and Masago Mayonnaise. 

I also ordered #3 called ""Maui"" and it used ""Pineapple Wasabi sauce"", which was interesting and attractive to me. On my goodness, you must try the sauce!!
It tasted amazingly as it was my first time to taste such sauce and you never know unless you try and taste it. The Maui has tuna, surimi crab, sweet egg, some vegetables, ginger, and wanton chips with ponzu sauce and the pineapple wasabi sauce. To my surprise, the all ingredients inside of the burrito go so well and I highly recommend you guys to try it out!!

If you are craving for sushi or something healthy, this place must be considered!!
I definitely keep going there to try other kinds of burrito and also would like to get a poke bowl with a lot of vegetables for my dinner.",vvKE3BrI7zMmPcnwNC3sHA,0,0,5,5pMnGSz7oXD5yh8aFvMnhw

Maybe I'm pickier because I'm from Los Angeles where the poke options are endless but this was very average for me. The prices are standard but the toppings (masago, etc.) are extra which is confusing to me because I've never seen that at any other poke place. Aside from the extra $ for some of the toppings that are usually free, the portions are honestly pathetic. The scoops they give you are so small I basically paid for a bowl of rice. I usually have my plate overflowing when I get poke. Not only that, but the spicy tuna looked like pumpkin pie filling? That's not poke. I got thought I was getting a poke bowl not a sushi bowl. Honestly, save your money and time, and get your sushi burritos from JaBurrito (or whatever they're named now) and get your poke from Island Sushi & Grill. Best poke in town. In the picture I posted up, the portions look a lot bigger but don't be fooled, it's small and not somewhere I'll be looking to come to again unless I have no other choice.",UU0o-Bjm3Qyj_S0p_xeEew,0,0,3,WR6snWVCAvjSNAhKfFg5cg

This night was one of those occasions, I was feeling some sushi and wanted it at all costs. I did a quick yelp search and went to nearest place to my location. That's how I ended up at pokeman. Coming in right away if was greeted by an enthusiastic staff that was willing to help me along my first time. As I pondered the menu the staff recommended that I get a bowl and I was going to trust them as they knew very well what they were doing. I chose a large size and went with the proteins of salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp all mixed up with pineapple wasabi sauce. Let me say that the pineapple wasabi sauce is absolutely amazing. It has the nice subtle flavor of wasabi and the amazing sweetness and flavor of pineapple. After was all said and done I sat down and enjoyed my meal. It was the best tasting meal I had all day.

The poke bowls are great with various sizes allowing you to get the right portion to feed your hunger. The poke bowls come with a scoop of crab meat and your choice of protein. You get seaweed salad and you get to chose your toppings. They also have many sauce, I love the eel sauce on everything!

The atmosphere is great and service is quick. But the lunch rush can have a line out the door. I this place is a good lunch stop. Only complaint is that it's on the pricy side for lunch.

On top of that, and I hate that I have to say this, is that it was very hard for me to understand the girl who was taking my order. It was partially to do with her thick accent but also the divider between us. Having to repeat everything because both of us couldn't hear (or understand) was a bit of an annoyance.

1503529,2016-07-08,9,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"Gotta catch 'em all!-- all the new sushiburrito and poke bowl spots opening up in Vegas lately, that is. Purportedly an offshoot of neighboring Izakaya Go, PokeMan has both options on the menu: large bowl ($11) includes three scoops of fish (in addition to surimi crab) with multiple customization options (some with a fee), set menu of burritos ranging from about $9-12.  The minimal increase in costs over other places is offset by their location, which is much more convenient than others across town.

I liked the bowl better than my burrito (the Yuzu), which was comparatively uninspired and lacking flavor- could use a spicy element, didn't notice any yuzu flavors to justify the name? I'll come back for the the build your own bowl option, they're the only spot in town to figure out that you're supposed to marinate the fish before putting it in the bowl rather than just drizzling it on top. Your bowl is as flavorful as you are creative- props for having additional options like octopus, scallops, and crawfish that other companies lack, as well as edamame and masago, etc.

Location is fairly small but seating makes good use of the space. Parking lot can be tricky to find a spot during peak hours.

2129651,2016-09-10,0,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"Stopped in last night to give this spot a try.

When I first heard about this whole Sushi Burrito concept about a month ago, I looked around at the reviews on yelp to see who I thought would have the best in the valley. I decided on another place (Soho) and ended up going there 3 times in about 4 weeks. I was really enjoying them as my new go-to for an inexpensive, clean meal. 

I was in the area of Pokeman last night which is where I was originally directed when I was told about Sushi Burritos and finally decided to give it a go. I was EXTREMELY impressed. The service was awesome, and the sushi burrito was even better. 

They don't allow you to just choose whatever you want to put on the burrito, they have a pretty set selection of about 15 for you to choose from. So unlike the other spot I went to, I didn't have the endless options. I ended up going with a #1 and the employee said if I like spicy, I should probably change it to a #2 since it was basically a #1 with the addition of jalapenos- so I did. I got the spiciest sauce they offered and it was HOT! (which I loved)

It was about $3.50 more than I typically pay at Soho but quite honestly, I had no problem paying the $12 for what I got because it was filling and very delicious. 

The burrito was big, their pre designed burrito I chose went together very well, and I was super happy with my experience. 

The next time I go for a sushi burrito, it will be to Pokeman without a doubt.",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,0,2,5,0DRC3QqecWIoEOk5sQSDfQ

I think the burrito was a little bigger than jaburritos. My boyfriend enjoyed his burrito but it need a tiny more flavor to it. I order the sushi bowl and it was worth getting a large cause the price difference from the medium wasn't too far at all. U get to choose 3 protein and I chose salad to with it. It also lacked a little flavor but I still ate it all lol. Due to the store being brand new, the service wasn't great. They made us wait because they had to finish the previous customers order first. They might need a longer assembly line to pick up the pace. The place is kinda tiny. The theme is clever. The Filipino gentleman working in the front was really kind though and I know he was trying his best to give great customer service. They have like a stamp card thing going on too but it's a app u have to download and if u buy 9 u get the 10th free I think.

The plus side to this is that you get to add what you like and customize it. I ended up getting a sushi burrito (The Canada) to go and they were very helpful on asking if what they were adding I was okai with it. I could say tho the avocados were a bit brown to green in color. Other than that it tasted fine. The sushi burrito itself was not bad, but did not have anything really special to it. The spicy salmon was alright in it, but I felt like maybe a little more flavor with the sauces they had avail.

First impression, price is just a couple dollars steeper than Soho. I got the ""large"" which gives you three scoops of protein. Only thing is, their scoops are pretty pathetic. A scoop of their bay scallop literally four pieces of little baby scallops. I can't imagine getting a small bowl. You'll literally have 3 small squares of fish.  Although, seaweed salad and the imitation crab mix here is a standard inclusion in their bowl. It's extra for those items at Soho. They also have little toppings like Furakake, Crispy Garlic, Dry Seaweed Flakes, etc that you can add to customize your bowl. I would say that their ""large"" is equivalent to Soho's 2 protein, BUT Pokeman's free scoop of crab makes up for it. I got the salmon, and octopus & scallops (soho does not carry octopus and scallops) with the Yuzu Aoili. 

First bite, mmmmm.. the Yuzu Aoili is flavorful, but not too much where its overpowering the taste of the fish. Pretty yummy, citrusy, creamy taste. Fish is pretty fresh tasting. The bad? OH NO. There was a deng bone in my salmon. lol, thank God I didn't choke on it 'coz I'm literally inhaling this food as I go.

Overall, its pretty good here. I like that the sauces don't mask the flavor of the poke, and they're not too much of a mayo-base like others, I'll visit again, this time to try the sushi burritos..",lh--ko0krSJvYSEmoYlJaA,1,0,4,gF3Ny6tBUJHldkuHOwENag

3476439,2016-06-27,1,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"This poke bowl restaurant has many choice for all to enjoy! They have a variety of burritos for different palettes. The protein they have available is inclusive to vegetarians, those who dont like raw fish, and those who dont like any fish in general. You can order a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. Everything is fresh, the decor is cute, and everybody is inviting.

The burrito menu are a fixed combination of ingredients, with different types to make anybody's taste buds sing. My personal favorite is the Eel Lover! Its their most expensive burrito at nearly $12 but it's eel and thats a pricy fish to get for any restaurant. Also available at PokéMan, they have customizable bowls. Small, medium, and large are the sizes. One scoop of protein for the small, two for medium, and three for the large. You choose your protein and then a sauce to mix in or drizzle over the meat. You then get many vegetable items to choose too accompany your meat and rice/salad. To top it ALL off, they have shaken toppings of your choice as well. For drinks, they have canned and fountain ranging from $1.50 to about $2.00.

The atmosphere, i say, is very laid back. They have many places to sit and eat your poke. Orange and white for the interior is a refreshing sight. Wide windows are on the building for nice natural lighting, but have blinds to keep the sun out if it gets too hot. This restaurant keeps super clean tables and bathrooms for us to use. I notice that the employees there keep it clean on their work surface and their gloves are changed so often. They are welcoming in the beginning and definitely are helpful with the menu. Knowledgeable and fast too! They try their best helping guests with whatever questions we have while also taking care of your order.

Another restaurant hopping on to the sushi burrito bandwagon, and PokéMan fits in perfectly. They don't have any significant problems for me to complain about. The system here is smooth and easy going. They easily got me to regularly buy their burritos, and I'm completely siked that a place like this exists in Chinatown!",mT6TPoduOMFmyov6fEiCFQ,1,1,5,FE0U3oC6lbrasgX19uTzLw

The like definitely tasted fresh, and the seasoned and spice were major key. I can't say they were bad but I had to ordered a large to fill me up. Luckily I got two drinks to wash it down. 

Pretty expensive poke bowl. Two bowls and three drinks totaled to 35$. Had to strap down and enjoy my expensive pokebowls.

I chose the hawaiian style poke, the salmon, and yellowtail, on top of sushi rice, with some unagi sauce.  All bowls come with seaweed salad and the crab.  For the toppings, I chose the mixed green salad, pickled cucumber, fresh cucumber, furikake, fried garlic and fried onion.

My initial thought was to eat half for lunch, half for dinner.  That didn't happen..I ate pretty much the entire bowl.  I was pleasantly surprise that the yellowtail was buttery and fatty.

#9
Has corn flakes, gives it an amazing crunch along with the taste. This was the first sushi burrito I tried at Pokeman and is what really drew me in to try the others.

#10 - Eel
I normally like eel but I give this one a 7/10. The eel chunks are chewy and large. 

#11 - Chicken
Worst one so far and likely to hold. Chicken has large amounts of grizzle it in and I had to spit out the meat. Also no crunch to it (you wouldn't want it with chicken anyways) and had a bland overall taste.",gakhurT9xcjCdPCBY541Gg,3,1,5,l3m1nH49v9lA4Oml1kFS6Q

Now this place opened up and wow this place really treats people well. From vegan diets to people being gluten sensitive. Although they pander to every diet, the food is still great. Surprisingly, the vegan burrito is actually better than the vegetarian one.
As for the ingredients, its always fresh. The fish, the vegetables, and even the garnishes. Since its raw fish, eat it as soon as you can. Thats kind of a part in the rules of nature. Dont let it sit in a hot car and drive home.
They offer soy paper as well, I like to get that with my burrito since it isnt elasticy like the nori.
Its a new business, so its gonna change some stuff often until they find their way. Hopefully they don't lose their way in my mind.

News flash, if you don't give your customers what they want they will not be happy, very likely to not come back, and share with their friends. 

Everyone MUST know I really enjoy this place... The quality, service (minus below), and cleanliness. So what has ticked me? :-) Next paragraph!

It was 3pm and I had yet to have lunch, I have after school pick up for my son and thought it'd be great to bring my son a mini spam burrito. Just spam and rice wrapped in seaweed very much like a spam musubi. They have a burrito with spam but action packed with all sorts of other yummies wrapped inside of it... The price is a little under $8. Well if you know the cost of spam, rice, and seaweed well HELL NO!! I will not pay $8 + tax for it. I asked who seems to be a partner/owner or manager if that price can be revisited as I'm looking for something much simpler and for a child. I feel most of the businesses offer kids menus with lowered prices etc... Well I was very disappointed with the answer of... NO with the reason being that they had already preset the price. So at the risk of losing a customer (me) who comes a few times a month with friends who now also come... Well you get the idea the reasoning makes zero sense to me. By no means am I asking for something free, nor deal hunting but what's right... Spam, rice, and seaweed should not cost $8+. At that point Hawaiian Style Poke, WINS-best of both!

Again, I enjoy my bowls and burritos here. The food is great... I'm specifically writing about this experience that will send me back to Hawaiian Style Poke or Soho Sushibowlritto where they listen to customers as well as have kid options.",F80__aVCvtswxqCcflp27Q,2,1,3,w9zmJctONG0iFthFqTBXUw

I finally realized they were referring to a restaraunt after seeing their friends posts on Facebook. That's what I get for being raised by Asian parents that are part of the Baby Boomer Generation . So we decided to go on the same day that there was an Yelp Elite event for Halal Guys on Thursday 8.11.16 that I was invited to so I ended up having two meals. I drop my parents off at Pokeman while I waited at Halal Guys to pick up a few items. 

Then I finally arrived at Pokeman and decided to BYO Poke Bowl. I was pleased with the outcome of my bowl that I forgot to take a picture. However the fish was delicious and fresh and the variety of toppings were great. I really enjoyed the Miso Seasame Sauce for my bowl, a bit of a creamy and sweet taste with a tangy flavor, it was good with the Yellowtail and Salmon mix that I got. It's amazing to see Poke concept explode throughout Vegas. It takes me back when I used to live in Hawaii everytime I have Poke! 

The staff on duty was very friendly and helpful especially when it came time to decide what items that we wanted.

Concept is very simple here. You can either get a burrito which is a set menu, or you can get a bowl and customize your way. I decided to get #2 called Pokeman burrito and also got a large bowl to go. 

Large bowl comes with three scoops of rice, along with three choices of protein, a choice of sauce and veggies. It's somewhat similar to Subway in that ingredients used are fresh. On top of that, you can customize it the way you like it! I went with yellowtail, salmon and ahi tuna with pokeman original sauce and furikake. I loved the fact that they mixed all the protein with sauce in a plastic bowl and marinated the fish to maximize the flavor. My bowl was delicious and filling. 

Pokeman burrito was savory and delicious too. I forgot to note what was inside the burrito but I liked the fish to rice ratio.

So i would recommend stopping at Pokeman for some grub and then heading over the short walk to Izakaya Go for some drinks! 

Anyways, on to the most important part-the food. The greatest part about this whole place is that the bowls are so customizable! I got a medium Poke bowl with Yellow tail and Ahi tuna as the protein. Now before we go any further we must discuss the sauce! Instead of just squeezing whatever sauce you decide to choose over the whole bowl, they do the super clever thing of tossing it to coat the protien-and then adding it all into your bowl. So don't you worry about getting an unflavored bite-because that will not happen.  Accompanied by seaweed salad, corn, green onions, avocado and the standard addition of surimi crab salad. To top off this masterpiece I had it sprinkled generously with Furikake (I have an unhealthy addiction to furikake btw).

S'goooooood! All ingredients were fresh and tasty, plus the staff was knowledgeable and friendly which is always a plus.

My recent visit, I had the Pokeman Sushi Burrito. It's a delicious meal with Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon.

I also love the fact that you are able to replace or take out ingredients that you are not very fond of. For the Island Crunch, for example, I alternate between keeping the shrimp tempura that originally comes with it or replacing it with Yellow tail marinated in their Pokeman sauce. Their bowls are basically the sushi burrito without the nori. You can customize what goes in the bowl with their easy steps to your hearts' content. Their bowls are also pretty good but I prefer the burritos more. I would definitely would have to come back more adventurous and try different burritos in the future! They are all so delicious!

I am definitely a fan and will continue to come back to maintain my Duchess! :) 

Definitely stop by and check them out!",IQg7_BBYNwvYv0hI-N2UzQ,6,2,5,S65p0TmAiaPtkVjp3UdFGw

You order at the little counter area and can chose either a burrito or bowl. They have some standard options you can pick from or start from scratch to create your own. I opted to go with the #1 pokeman but subbed regular tuna for spicy tuna. The burrito was huge, I ate half and saved the other half for later. I really enjoyed the fresh flavor, but wish there had been more sauce on it. I ended up dipping it in soy quite a bit.

They serve you your base ingredients with rice, surimi crab, and seaweed salad, and your choices of protein. I always get the large bowl, so I have the choice of 3 scoops. I usually get yellowtail and salmon. Their veggies are fresh and great to top off an already loaded bowl.

The poke cubes are regular poke-sized. If you've been to Soho SushiBurrito, you may recall that their fish is diced small. Here at PokeMan, you can get chunks of fish with every bite.

I give it 2 stars because I really appreciated the variety of toppings I could add to my bowl, and the overall portion size.  I don't really thing the sauces were flavorful or unique.  And maybe I am spoiled with my regular poke shop nearby my house that use FRESH salmon and ahi, but I could really tell that the fish used at Pokeman was frozen/old (I normally can't tell that distinctly).  And finally the seaweed salad was Extremely fishy, I literally took it out of my bowl onto a napkin on the side.  Seaweed salad is usually my favorite part! But not when it tastes and smells like it is spoiled or poorly cleaned.

The choices of style to order are either a bowl or burrito. I prefer a bowl because it seems you get more bang for the buck and you could mix it up when you're eating. 

The sizes for the bowls to choose from is small (1 scoop), medium (2 scoop) and large (3 scoop) of protein. I'm a hungry fella so I went for the large.  I ordered their white tun, spicy salmon and yellowtail with brown rice. I added some seaweed, crab, avocado, cucumber and their miso sauce.

Prices were reasonable and be careful some of their toppings are 50 cents extra charge and it adds up pretty quick. 

The servers were pretty nice and helpful and made sure we sampled a few things before we ordered to make sure we liked it.

The inside of the restaurant was pretty clean and I liked the interior design of the place.

I get the medium bowl which includes 2 scoops of protein. I like their miso salmon and reg salmon.  I did like their hawaiian style poke at first too but then it started tasting too salty after a few bites. :(

Their Spicy sauce has a korean gochujang base which disappointed me because I would have preferred just a spicy version of their house sauce. (Gochujang tends to overwhelm any other flavors and it isn't even that spicy. )

For sauces, I prefer their yuzu and the sesame sauces.  

Overall this place is like a 3.5 star for me in terms of value. To-see gives way more fish for less but I will still frequent here during my lunch breaks.

I imagine it has to be good since it's closer to the west coast and this has been trending for a long time before it hit the east coast.

I went for the bowl and got half and half of sushi rice and spring mix (highly recommend!). I then chose a large (3 scoops of protein) and chose Spicy Salmon Miso, Yellowtail, and a Hawaiian mixture of Ahi tuna, onions, and soy marinade. I then chose to have the protein mixed with their spaishi sauce. The bowl comes with krabstick mix and seaweed which is cool. I added pickled cucumber, avocado ($.50 charge), onions, extra scallions and cilantro (Most veggies are unlimited). I then topped it with fried garlic, onion, and furikake. For $14, this looked hefty and I was excited. Decent service and I was very comfortable. 

The food was delicious. I loved the spicy salmon mix!!! The spaishi sauce was nice with a good kick. I would probably try some aioli next time.

I would suggest that they have a top over their FULL trash can. As a place that serves raw food, cleanliness is important. As for everything else it was fine but hygiene is important to me. I will return and change it to five stars if that is fixed.

Also tried the karage burrito which was amazing. The karage wasn't soggy and still had a crunch and all the ingredients in it melded all together creating an awesome bite. The only draw back was that you can't customize the burritos the way you can the bowls. Will definitely explore the other items on the menu.,P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,0,0,4,tcE12Mzmp0CDQ-OHtqFRpg

5458390,2017-05-11,0,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"Food: 5/5 - At first glance, I thought the portions were pretty small, but the sushi burrito and the poké bowl were surprisingly filling! 

Price: 4/5 - The pricing is pretty decent compared to other poké menus I've seen. No complaints here! 

Service: 4/5 - The employees were really friendly and helpful in their recommendations. 

Environment: 3.5/5 - Some of the tables definitely needed a wipe down, but nothing too concerning. I would just recommend to the employees to walk around the restaurant floor often to check for tidiness. 

Recommendation? Yes, I would recommend Pokéman to anyone looking for a quick bite in Las Vegas, NV. 

Tip: If you show them your Pokémon Go! team, you will receive 10% off your order! They did not have wifi there when I went, so I recommend taking a screenshot of it or loading it ahead of time before you go in.",QXZcLF_3fa7U4hE79FsCLw,0,0,4,yYst5CZ8XZqEzbF578jHJw

Out of all of the poke bowl places that I've tried in Vegas, I believe that Pokeman has the freshest quality ingredients and best customer service. My custom salmon bowl is always on point, and the flavors always go well together. The sauce is not overpowering, which is great because I like to taste my salmon LOL. I also enjoy how they give free crab with every bowl. My poke bowl always comes out as soon as possible and whenever there's a long line, the employees are always able to make their bowls and burritos as fast and efficient as possible.

Really enjoyed my food, I ordered my create your own Poké bowl. My fish selection was salmon and tuna of course. I also added my own personal toppings I wanted in it. The crab is an extra $.50 cents same goes for the edamame. My portion was perfect no complaints.

I've always wondered what happen to the previous place called ""Kuma"". I guess pokeman took over this space which was a good choice which is close to Chinatown area. Will definetly visit again.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,2,1,5,ITZK5sG5I67wJwXPpQjsZg
5659199,2016-07-12,3,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"You know that when you already know that you're going to go back to a place after one visit, it warrants more than 3 stars.

Many trips through the Starbucks drive through have had me anticipating the opening of Pokeman. I was so happy Kuma (gross) closed to make way for a poke spot - especially because the poke place in the next shopping center is closed on Tuesdays & is super pricey. 

Order is pretty straight forward. Either pick your sides and toppings or choose premade flavor combinations. A large comes with 3 scoops of protein and is decently sized.

When I went on 7/11/16, I noticed that their spicy tuna is a chopped mix instead of chunks of tuna coated in spicy mayonnaise. Once I saw that, I opted for just plain cubed tuna. Also, I love, love, love that they offer spring mix instead of rice.

They utilize some rewards app that I've never heard of. It's not one specific to their store. I didn't have time to download it while at the register but whatever, not the end of the world.

In wish this place had opened sooner because it's one of like... 3 options I have to eat now by my work with my tiny little 30 min lunch break.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,8,5,4,lURiZEdBwqnyqQkCD-bwPA

5750260,2016-10-14,0,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"This place has become my go to lunch spot. Its tastes fresh and is very filling, but doesnt give you the itis. I went with a medium bowl the first time, but wasnt enough fish for my liking so I have gone with a large the past 2 times.

This is what I get and its delicious and satisfying every time.

White rice if you want it to be warm, sushi rice if you dont like the idea of eating slightly warm raw fish. I found both to be tasty still, but whatever floats your boat. Warm raw fish can be a mindfuck and off putting though, so recommend you eat it there if you go with it.

Protein: I always get the hawaiian poke as well as the salmon and hamachi with just a splash of the original sauce on them.

Toppings: seaweed salad, crab salad, red onion, masago, pickled cucumbers, and crispy garlic(makes a huge difference in flavor and texture).

I destroy the entire bowl.. every.single.time.

Service and portion consistency could use some work. I think if you go closer to closing they hook you up with more fish since theyre probably going to toss the leftovers anyways.

Some of the employees are nice and energetic. Some not so much. But hey.. they scoop fish and rice all day and have to deal with picky and demanding customers all day.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,5,yuBD1X6iMc5cJ66ByQPhBg

I love seeing that the owners also work as hard as their staff. You lead by example, and these guys do that.

The place is always super clean. It would be cool to have a place to sit outside, but, that's not a must.",4_wwdkHPvEzHHOt0-brJZQ,1,1,5,9ohiuPZUefH1PRyhxyBKcA
5876155,2017-09-19,8,V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,"Found this place on Yelp while driving back from Seven Magic Mountains. The name sold me. I mean, c'mon. It's clever.

The set-up is similar to other poke shops I've visited. Menu on the side, you pick your base of rice (brown or white), salad, or whatever you fancy. I'm a white rice girl all the way. Brown rice is ok, but white rice has been my jam since I was a wee blonde babe. You can order small (one scoop of protein), medium (two scoops), or large (three scoops). The small is a good size, and I'm an eater. I was satisfied and not overly bloated.

The bowls come with crab and seaweed salad, so let them know if you don't want that addition. Why you wouldn't want it is just plain weird, but I'm not here to judge. I'm just here for the poke.

The folks there rock their orange uniforms aggressively. Not many people can pull off that bright of an orange, but this staff has nailed it. They are super gracious with big smiles. I'm into it. Great customer service and kindness are very special qualities that I don't take for granted.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,25,20,5,RaoxKMiuaeVA3SZuaee3Ow
