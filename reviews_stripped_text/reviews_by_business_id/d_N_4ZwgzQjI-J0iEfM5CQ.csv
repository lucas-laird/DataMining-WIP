638417,2017-01-15,0,d_N_4ZwgzQjI-J0iEfM5CQ,I LOVE Rice but this rice was nasty gross. And was deffinetly NOT worth my $15. I had to force myself to eat it after spending that much on a very small portion. I didn't even get $15 worth of food. Don't waste your money!,sec_72MjQnif4OvsqJ2pUA,0,0,1,GKPeVmbpfLpiWsr3L092OA

1287601,2016-07-14,0,d_N_4ZwgzQjI-J0iEfM5CQ,This place sucks.  Avoid at all costs.  Crispy shrimp was soggy and chow mein had no taste at all. Would not recommend.  Adding soy sauce did not help.,E_wiv7ylmiqYxImObGpq1A,1,0,1,6PchXPClBJSanmTExRdn3g

The ginger chicken lacks flavor as well the chow mien and fried rice.,6CoirPrzxe7u3re7JPwFsQ,0,1,1,FDV9IyJvO9Wh1QXTwcxvgQ

Also, their placemat tray has a 50% off coupon that they will not honor. The cashier says to bring it next time. They didn't give me a receipt either.

Instead I wasted $19 on a bowl of Orange Chicken and one Blue Moon from here.

No where close to Panda Express's food - the veggies looked good as well that I had along with my white rice and orange chicken, but they were not tasty. Chicken was kind of soggy and not very flavorful as well. I didn't even finish my small, over priced bowl. Do not recommend!",506keshsLa102eajCtaZ_A,1,0,1,niE7hNc000VazTYBNR57bQ

About half of my chow mien was dry, and almost crunchy like. It was not worth the $13 I payed. And I ordered food around 6pm, so I would have expected it to be more fresh. I was excited expecting good quality at least like Panda Express considering that it's in the Manalay bay but no...",JZV0xqrHk0czpSZKGAEr9Q,1,0,1,Lssu3jyE2ZsH5D6Lt9w_EQ

I am sad I just wasted $12 on a poorly copied version of Panda Express. I get it, the costs will all be expensive here in Vegas but the portions are just sad. And the meat is dry, the veggies taste depressed and who can't properly cook rice?? The rice was mushy, too much water or hadn't been cooked long enough. 

The people working could def afford a smile but probably not when they hate their job. Stingy portions. Overpriced. I hate their font choices. 

Only thing you should get here is beer.",qjsboWxpJVtqUu-D14SNWw,1,0,1,r8LOUoMhuqVTiQcKWtEWQQ

They were out of steamed rice during the lunch rush. Hahaha. Crappy food. Cold, soggy and tasteless. Do not eat here.",OHVhLKw_uIE7saIt_S-udw,7,4,1,rpl9clVhN7UFyWzzPQpHUw

My first sign this place was horrible should have been the lack of people in line during the noon lunch hour.  The chow mien tasted like it was just thawed and placed in the bowl being served without actually warming it up.  The orange chicken had one piece of actual chicken, the rest of it was batter nuggets with orange sauce.  There's a PANDA EXPRESS right across the street.  Take the walk, you'll be glad you did.  I'm definitely checking Yelp reviews from now on.",D8GyPSp1zJ4qHVdmRC1z9Q,0,0,1,OfJLMlSXugqXTgmHlN1S2w
3814652,2018-06-11,0,d_N_4ZwgzQjI-J0iEfM5CQ,This place has the best food I have had in a food court. It is also better than Panda Express. It has nice workers also great food.  This is at the Mandalay Bay food court near the Convention center which is at the end of the hotel. If you stay at the hotel you walk all the way past border grill and then walk farther than you will find it in the middle of the food court. I have been here many times I always ask for beef and broccoli or broccoli and beef. I do not like the sides so I ask for two servings of broccoli and beef. If you don't want to have asian food I would not go here but I love it. Also you get a paper on the trays for every restaurant except Subway. You will find coupons for the restaurants including Pan Asian express. Also look for the coupons in the pictures I will post. But there is none for subway. I hope you try out Pan Asian express. Also if you stay at a MGM resort you can change it to your  room.,n37A0boHSlc5mHzpcvz4Tg,0,0,5,HAveUZ4_GQFzl5EcaIosLQ
4020929,2017-08-03,0,d_N_4ZwgzQjI-J0iEfM5CQ,"Wish I could give it no stars at all, this has to be the worst place in this entire hotel area if not on the entire strip. The lady asking us what we wanted was rude, talked really quiet and aggressive, like we're just more money talking. Then the food, we went there around 5:30 pm, and most of the things was already gone, and what was left didn't appeal to us whatsoever. I got the orange chicken, other then the chicken I didn't like anything else. The rice seemed way to dry to me. My husband got broccoli beef, with mushrooms. The broccoli looked 5 days old, the mushrooms seemed like a piece of bread with some sauce over them and the meat was way to chewy, felt like gum. He thought the rice was okay, wouldn't recommend this place to anybody at all, not going here again either.",WUAlNVlBKsvtFm9NDSE5GQ,0,0,1,OrIyijfl792nwA5Hath4LQ
4201453,2017-12-26,1,d_N_4ZwgzQjI-J0iEfM5CQ,"I typically do not give one star reviews. However Pan Asian deserves it. It was a very disappointing lunch stop at Mandalay Bay. 
We were roaming around Mandalay Bay on Christmas and Ian suddenly uttered the dreadful words ""I am hungry"". Most of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay hadn't opened yet so we proceeded to their food court before he turned cranky. We got Ian a pizza and the Mrs settled on grabbing her lunch at this place.

After placing her order (Broccoli Beef with rice) and paying close to $11, she received the smallest portion of a lunch plate ever at any restaurant. The quantity of food is probably less than half a panda express lunch. You would have to order two portions at $22 to appease your hunger.

The food itself was doused in soy sauce with minimal quantities of beef and broccoli (see for yourself in the picture). Offerings in their menu are very limited as well.

I do not recommend to rely on this restaurant for your dining needs.",DqNgAUKmZEFnLJcREzd5SA,5,1,1,I5fGN_8e6xStZ5gnKInYPw
