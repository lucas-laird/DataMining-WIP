374803,2011-07-16,1,eBtEx6IQsQDoIDJXTDKdXA,"From what I understand, Yelp is to review unique and fun places, not your typical everyday joints. For this review, and those rules, please accept my apology. What I have to say must be heard.

You see, Arby's is an amazing place. It is lumped in with the McDonalds and Burger Kings of the world, when in fact, it should hold a different place in the hearts of Americans. 

When I was 16 years old I landed my first real paper paycheck job at an Arby's in Holland, MI. I thought I was big time. I made $8.00 an hour. I scored free grub from time to time. I flirted with the lizadies who came through the drive through window. What else could you want? 

Through my time at Arby's I learned a man named Russ Umphimheimer owns the most Arby's under an umbrella corporation called RTM. He also owned a few other joints I think a Hardees (never seen one), a breakfast roll place, etc. Arby's was his crowning achievement though. He owned an empire of roast beef and curly fries. I met him once and shook his hand. He had a bunch of gold rings. 

Anyway, now you have the background of my review, and you see I am only giving this joint 2 stars, you have to wonder why. I will tell you why..  no green beans on the menu.

Through out parts of the mid-west and the south there are renegade rebel Arby's. They were not bought out by RTM during Russ Umphenhimer's Arby's empire take over. Think of these places as the rebel alliance in Star Wars, and the RTM Arby's as The Empire. Russ Umphenhimer can be Darth Vader if you want him to be, but he's really not that mean. 

RTM (stands for Results Through Motivation) set a menu standard through out his millions of Arby's. Every menu had to be the same. You can always tell when you are in a rebel Arby's because they will have some random stuff on the menu, such as green beans. The franchisee operator will sell you green beans (at least they used to), but hardly any of the Arby's would order them because they were all RTM Arby's and thus, couldn't be free to set the menu as they saw fit. 

This Arby's had it's typical roast beef sandwiches. I opted for the beef and cheddar sans red ranch sauce, cause I think it's gross and I saw somebody dump a whole tub on their head once and run around chasing a girl. Bad juju right there. I also ordered the chicken fingers, which are back on the menu after a couple year MIA stint. Topped it off with an order of curly fries and a jamoca shake. I can't spell jamoca. Sorry. 

The food I ordered was great for a fast food joint, and worth the extra dollar to upgrade me from a whopper or big mac. However, to have a truly 5 star Arby's experience, I lust for the day where I can order green beans off of a fast food menu and have a hearty chuckle about this fact. Until this day, fight The Empire, and support your local rebel Arby's (they usually have those old signs ""Arby's Rost Beef Sandwich is Delicious"").",MJrSvJ-Tz1HXKOOCHnlyoQ,2,0,2,40hEKkwu0ydQMyw5GH0AYQ

And when i did the bottom bun was full of sauce and all soggy there was WAY to much sauce on it , plus it was really cold sauce. When i bit into it. The sandwich was extremely hot. And the chicken seemed hard. So basically it was a combination of cold because of the sauce and hot because the chicken was hot . I threw it away after 1 bite.

Placed a order for One Combo & 2 Sandwiches... They only had one cook and we waited over 15 minutes... Ok we understand there busy... But that doesn't explain why ALL my freaking food was ice cold.. Did the chef forget to cook it or what? I got up and told the cashier.. When I told her all my food was cold she just stood there all puzzled not knowing what to do... 

This time they took 25 minutes to remake the order even though we were the only ones in the restaurant! 

I told the cashier we have been here almost an hour and wanted my money back! She was hasnieat at first but I walked out the 5 minutes later with my money and charged $5 bucks for my 2 small drinks..

2654342,2017-07-28,1,eBtEx6IQsQDoIDJXTDKdXA,"Horrible. My husband and children ordered 2 chicken, bacon and Swiss, 4 beef and cheddar and a potato cake. We waited more than 20 minutes for the chicken sandwiches and when they finally arrived they were crispy chicken sandwiches. My husband asked for what he ordered. He waited an additional 10 minutes. All they did was remove the chicken from the crispy chicken sandwiches and add bacon and Swiss. The ranch and mayo was still on the sandwich. No mustard sauce. Health codes require a wrong sandwich to be tossed out and the correct sandwich to be made. This is to prevent food born illness. They violated safe food handling practices. The beef and cheddar were cold and the potato cakes were frozen. I'm talking completely frozen solid. Really? To add to this colossal waste of time and money, shortly after, my husband got sick. Nausea and diarrhea. This morning he is still belching from his bout of food poisoning from those bad chicken sandwiches. Will never eat at that location again.

I don't know if I just grew out of them or if they've changed, but their food just tastes awful now.  It tastes like it's loaded with preservatives.  I will say this, the one saving grace to this meal was their brown sugar bacon was very good.  And I will say that this Arby's was clean with a friendly staff unlike several I've been in over the past few years, that were filthy.  But the roast beef was terrible.  And the curly fries taste way over-seasoned and were all stuck together.  Not to mention, they had the Dr. Pepper and Root beer lines mixed up so each tasted like a little bit of each.

3736531,2015-01-30,0,eBtEx6IQsQDoIDJXTDKdXA,"Look, I grew up in the Midwest where there are a ton of Arby's all around. I expect the higher prices and a bit slower service. That's just what it is. I'm ok with that. It's the only fast food restaurant where I trust that the meat is, in fact, actually just meat. And I think as far as drive through options are concerned, this offers the most options for someone trying to not die of a heart attack. 

This Arby's is just eh. I have yet to meet an Arby's on this side of the country that meets the standards of the average Arby's back home. I don't get it. This is cowboy food. It should be better here. But whatever. 

So this location- today was my first time there. Probably not going back... Maybe? But probably not. I was there at 10:30 am. Not a normal time for an Arby's visit but I was leaving the pediatrician's office and decided this would be a better lunch than whatever I could make from my boring groceries at home. Also, my poor kid got a shot and I figured I'd treat him to some French fries. (Don't judge me- we do this very rarely.)

So at 10:30, I understand if they aren't fully ready to go with all the menu items, but omg this visit took a full 15 minutes or more. That's a long time to be getting fast food. And I was the only one in line when I pulled in but then someone came in behind me and I felt all guilty for making them wait.. I didn't even order anything weird. 

The food was fine. No complaints. It's par for the Arby's course. 

The service was lack luster. I swear there were only 2 people working and the guy was absent from the window for a long long time when he was getting my food. :( No enthusiasm or joy in their demeanors. 

Basically, I will think about coming back if I'm really, really not in a rush and want to have time to sit in my car and text people or check Facebook. Otherwise, this is not worth the time suck or awkwardly unfriendly encounter with the staff.",5gVLjO3wqplXr6IBuK5Vgg,0,0,3,OLZ02sv5gKJLKJM5Au87Lg
