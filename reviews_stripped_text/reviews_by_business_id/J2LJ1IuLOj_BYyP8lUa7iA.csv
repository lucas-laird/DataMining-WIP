Overall it's quaint and small. There's a huge parking lot so that's not an issue. You can find everything here despite the size so overall it's good.",LaOFbgqKHc5fHlO4rtRpkg,0,1,4,XIdtjoM3KjLEUTAZu_UG5w

I have never seen such fresh fish and meat before my entire life and they have the most random but awesome fruit selection you have ever seen. You'll find just about every ethnic appropriate food possible plus all the main staples of many other ethnicities.
 Prices are very similar to what you will find it an Albertson's or whole foods etc.
If you're in the area make sure you go, the staff are always very attentive and will answer any and all questions you have :-)",CGCDnRwWHbsx3p6yRUE4Hg,1,1,4,YsNcEJ_aoAsZHGlONNWOew

Well they do and I don't feel bad that 'm just now doing a review on it because based on the lack of reviews it already has I don't think I'm the only one who didn't know! Our Chinatown in Las Vegas isn't the largest but it has pretty much everything you need. From food to a little mini mall and other miscellaneous things. If you've never experienced coming down here you should, just make sure you have sufficient auto insurance because this particular street has the most accidents... :-)",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,3,3,Yh0y8QQWaVQUuIoWl0S1fQ

Seriously, this place makes San Francisco's Chinatown look like Afghanistan. The food is great, but definitely hit and miss. There are amazing gems to find, however, especially the further West you go. Noteworthy stops are Raku, Sweets Raku, Kabuto, Nakamura-Ya, Snowflake Shavery, Monta, Swish, and Tea Station. They also have a variety of massage places, again hit and miss as is the case with most Chinatowns. The Foot Spa by Raku is the best one. Overall, definitely worth getting off the Strip to check out and one of my favorite cultural places to explore with friends.",UHFhOK5OTPFVK0g05QN9Yg,2,3,5,n9dJTODvbEmKBzXYVli0Bg

There are several plazas there:
- Chinatown Plaza: the most popular and probably the OG.  It has 99 Ranch supermarket, ginseng store, reflexology, travel center and restaurants.  
- Pacific Asian Plaza: Shun Fat supermarket is the anchor of this plaza.
- Great China Plaza.
- The Center at Spring Mountain.
- Tokyo Plaza:  Raku and Monta are here since they are Japanese =P

I go to Las Vegas Chinatown when I get tired of eating buffets.  You can get Chinese, Malaysian, Filipino, Vietnamese and even Japanese foods @ Chinatown.  Craving boba?  Chinatown has Volcano Tea and #1 Boba Tea.

Too bad they don't have slot machines here.  It would be cool to eat dim sum while playing slot =P",W7DHyQlY_kXls2iXt-_2Ag,55,55,3,p-JMWTRVRK4yTmD_-LDatQ
