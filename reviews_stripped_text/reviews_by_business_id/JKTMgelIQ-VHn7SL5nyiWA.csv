The server Jack is very friendly and offered us a complimentary  green tea to try. It was like a Thai tea  fusion. They are sampling it to customers for review.  We love it!

We ordered the coconut shrimp, salmon rolls, and pad see ew. The salmon rolls were unique and interesting. Delicious, too! The pad see ew was very good.

Will come back again.

The crab fried rice, also blew me away because it not only came with lots of crab meat but they also put soft shell crab in it. It is unreal how great this place is and how empty it is. I really hope it does well and people start filling up the tables because I would love to be able to come here for years to come!!

The crab rangoon is awesome, really cheesy - so if you like a little less crab taste and a little more cream cheese, this one would be right up your alley. The chicken satay is well-marinated and tender, you almost don't need the peanut sauce (but who would pass it up?)

The chicken pad se ew is definitely the best I've had on this side of town, and the tom kha is delicious. It's a really large serving, enough for two meals. Plus, they have a mild/medium/spicy scale, but include the spices separately so you can mix in to your taste, which is a nice touch. Much better than guessing you'd be fine with medium, ordering it mixed in and losing.

The spice level in the yellow curry was spot on, I must say! We had it delivered, and did ask for a couple of simple requests. No raisins in one dish, and steamed tofu instead of fried.
 Neither request was fulfilled, which was disappointing. All things considered, we probably won't be ordering from here again.",TWWPxQ1ulzYsXJoWRrm8vg,0,0,3,psTX-kSEgllWa-UWBvx-vA

Everything was delicious - yellow curry entree with rice and appetizers: absolutely wonderful potstickers, drizzled with a totally lovely sauce, salmon rolls (basically egg rolls with a big piece of salmon in it), and crab rangoon.  It gets a 4 instead of 5 *s rating for the following reasons: (1) the menu indicated the salmon rolls had cheese in them--if there was, it was completely indiscernible, and (2) the food was piping hot--except for the crab rangoon, which was delicious but not simply room temperature, but actually cold (not sure how that is even possible).

3391616,2017-08-11,0,JKTMgelIQ-VHn7SL5nyiWA,"Delicious food and a cool restaurant located off of hectic Eastern Ave.
Decore inside is traditional and modern. This sanctuary located off the busiest road in Henderson is a welcome addition to the tons of restaurants in the area. Service is spot on and prompt. Good Thai tea and the Singha beer is nice and cold.
Coconut crab appetizer is tasty and the plum sauce is a sweet addition. I kind of suspect the shrimp might be from a package, but still decent.
Yellow curry was too spicy for me at medium level, but still very very good. Carrots were cut in such an labor intensive way and the potato in this dish is cooked perfectly. Drunken Noodles are very good, but will have to say the noodles to everything else ratio is a bit off with less noodles than normal, but still well cooked, flavorful and not greasy. Every piece of meat in the dish was tender and seasoned perfectly.
Chicken fried rice is excellent and the chicken is tender and lots of it. Tastes great, but the presentation is a bit off since the dish is monochromatic.
Portions to me was just right and still some food left over to go.
Resonable prices and great service, I need to come back and try the lunch specials and other numerous dishes.
Awesome place, but if headed south on Eastern it's a bit of a challenge to make that left turn into the parking lot since there is so much traffic.

I went in for the lunch special and ordered the Pad Thai, and not only was it made to my specifications, but it was quick, and the waiter was so nice and accommodating. I really hope more people discover this place, because it really is a great little restaurant.

The lunch specials start at $6.99 and comes with soup,  salad, rice, and egg roll with sweet chili sauce. They have a wide variety of Thai dishes. Don't judge a restaurant by the amount of people inside! Small family restaurants that start out always need time to reach their stride.

3432273,2018-01-11,0,JKTMgelIQ-VHn7SL5nyiWA,"You know somethings is really good when you can't wait to get home and YELP about it.  Buddha Thai Bistro is a pleasant surprise. Maybe that's why I liked it so much.

Today, my intention was to visit the Hawaiian-style restaurant a few doors down. Due to my early work hours, I go to lunch before 12, making me so happy to beat the lunch rush. And because of this, the parking lot for Buddha Thai Bistro was empty. What caught my eye at Buddha Thai was their handwritten signage near their door indicating that lunch specials start at $6.99. Good enough for me to re-direct my attention.

This restaurant took over a Peruvian restaurant that was here for years. I've always wanted to go to that restaurant but never was able to as my husband insisted that we go to the Hawaiian restaurant because he just had to have poke. When I saw the Peruvian restaurant had closed and that a Thai restaurant took over, I actually resented them for it and refused to even look their way. I was so disturbed by the opening of another Thai and/or Chinese restaurant, that I actually snickered each time I drove past it in the parking lot. I'm sorry :(

In any case, I thought to myself, I couldn't pass up lunch at under $10. I'll try it this one time. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to see their modern decor. It is smaller than the Thai restaurant in the next door parking lot, but this place seems nicer.

I was greeted by the nice gentleman and quickly reviewed the lunch specials in order to beat others coming in and getting their orders in before mine. I was in the mood for fried noodles and ordered the Chow Mein with chicken, instead of getting the Pad Thai or the Yellow curry.

Other items on the lunch menu include Chili and Mint, Stir-fried mix veggies, Sweet and sour, Mongolian, and Stir-fried American broccoli.  Choices for these dishes are Mixed veggies and tofu where the price is right at $6.99. Adding chicken raises the price to $7.99, adding beef raises to $8.99 or adding shrimp will cost you $9.99.

What I love about Thai restaurants and their lunch specials is that it comes with more, like soup, salad and an egg roll.  What I learned later is that it comes with THAI TEA or thai coffee.  Thai Tea me please! 

First came the vegetable soup, which was ok.

While seated at the table, they do have other specials listed on the different cards. Unfortunately, during lunch, no curry pastries are available :(  So I settled on shrimp shumai. It comes with six pieces, it is beautifully arranged, and tasted alright. When they mean shrimp shumai, they really mean shrimp and not shrimp on top of the pork.  This cost me $7.99.

Then came my main dish served on a really large platter. My lunch special included a serving of chow mein, green salad, egg roll and sweet sour sauce for the egg roll.  The egg roll was okay. The salad dressing, however, was delicious. I wish I knew what it was but I didn't ask because I could barely understand my waiter. And I thought my chow mein was really good. Both the chicken and chow mein had a slight bbq grill taste to it.

The other thing that is going to bring me back probably tomorrow for happy hour, $3.99 appetizers and buy one drink, get the second free.And you know what? The curry pastries is on that list!

One additional great thing about Buddha Thai Bistro, they participate in Yelps cash back program. Cash back is 7%.  As soon as they rang me up, I immediately got a message from Yelp that my cash back would be $1.21. It really is nice to be repaid for eating out.

So great atmosphere, great customer service, good food, great price. I'll give this place 5-stars.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,1,0,5,mMJhKMlOB1hZ1vlfg0Og2w

I've never tried a pepper/garlic dish before but it was amazing. I only ordered tofu because adding meat made it a little too pricey and the portion size was nice for 1 but would like a bit more for the price. The Thai sauce they provided on the side was so good too. Definitely a game changer.

Pricing was reasonable for the portion sizes. The portions were maybe a bit smaller than other Thai restaurants, but the pricing was less so it balanced out.

I was here on Friday night. There was a large group in the center when we walked in .... To complete quiet. No music and everyone just stared at us, probably because we were talking as we walked in (because who expects deafening silence upon entering a restaurant?). We got over it pretty quick and sat down. I noticed there was only one person working the floor and he seemed very flustered. He was attentive enough but in an inconvenient way... Taking things off the table too quickly, not asking the right questions, etc. 
I'm an ex-restaurant manager from NYC and I've seen everything so I wasn't annoyed or angry... my boyfriend can't say the same. 
I really wanted to get up and help the server better prioritize his approach to handling tables and take out orders as the only server working. I believe the manager was there and was helping to run the food and, I would guess, packing up orders and expediting.

Overall I definitely want to come back, the drunken noodle was fantastic! And I'm hoping it was a simple under-staffed situation with the service. But please, please turn the music to a proper level.

The chicken in the curry was rubbery with no flavor at all and the medium is not at all medium; more like mild. There was also this weird rancid taste to the curry? 
Not a solid yellow curry and considering my experience I don't see why it's one of their most popular items. You would think that because it was a popular item, there would be a little more TLC put into it. 
The lunch special does come with a good amount of food for $6.99 + tax. It came with a soup, side of rice, salad, entree, and egg roll. But if you get an order to-go maybe don't put the egg roll with the dressing soaked salad next time, Buddha Bistro.

Before we discovered this outrageous total. We tried the food....
I forgive certain aspects of the food when ordering delivery. I will not complain if it's lukewarm or not crispy as expected. 
The Tom Kha was very average and the coconut milk looked like curdled milk. Not aesthetically pleasing at all.The Tom Yum was ok, not spectacular. 
The Red Curry was actually quite good. I especially enjoyed this dish. It paired very well with the rice. 
The Fried Banana had a piece of onion in the roll which turned us OFF immediately. I do not like onions. The vegetable rolls were bland, but probably were awesome when they were fresh. The sauce was way too sweet.

My go-to Thai restaurant is across town, but we were craving Panang curry and opted to give it a try. It was a pleasant surprise and we really enjoyed our lunch. 

My boyfriend ordered the Panang curry with tofu and I ordered the Basil & Chili with chicken from the lunch special. The lunch special comes with egg drop soup, a vegetarian eggroll, a salad, and the entree. The best part is that it also comes with the option of Thai coffee or Thai iced tea for the low price of $7.99 (for chicken. It's less or more for other choices of meat). Both entrees came with rice as well. We ordered the chicken at a level three in spice and the Panang curry at ""medium"" in spice. Heads up - medium is HOT. The panang curry was delicious regardless and had a really good flavor. In my opinion, the basil and chili chicken was too salty. They were very generous with the vegetables though and the rice offset it. 

The server was really attentive and friendly despite the fact that a lunch time Saturday crowd came in at once and she was the only waitress on the floor. She was giving everyone attention whether it was people dining in or those ordering take-out.

We started with the wonton soup. Its a staple dish for us. .. so we are constantly looking for the best. This place does it right the flavor of the broth is spiced perfectly. The wontons do not get lost they can stand alone,  with ground pork and whole baby shrimp... yummy! 

Then we enjoyed the soft shell crab fried rice. Whoa! The rice alone is amazing but top it off with a healthy portion of crab. It was so tender and mixed to perfection. If you are an egg freak like I get a lil wild order a fried egg and add it to your rice.  Mouth watering!

If we weren't full enough we ordered chinese broccoli with beef. It was worth the button popping of our pants. Crisp broccoli with thinly sliced beef. The sauce, yes, not too salty or sweet it was just right! Also i will mention they do not use fillers in there sauce,  which for me is a huge plus.  

We were absolutely full. .. but if you have room for a few more bites.  YOU MUST TRY HOMEMADE COCONUT ICE CREAM! It's creamy yet icy with tender pieces of natural coconut. I ate the whole scoop and regret nothing! Lol

Right when you walk in, you are greeted by the kindest people who i believe own the place. They give you time to look at the menu if you are taking out but are eager to assist you if you are dining in. Super friendly and answers every and any question you may have.

Thai tea is an absolute favorite, I have to always order it. Not bitter, not overly sweet and not too creamy just perfect! The wonton soup with noodles is delicious, I'm a sucker for it.

After I was asking a couple of questions, I'm glad they lowered the volume of the Thai music as it was a little bit loud to hold a conversation.  This restaurant was empty during a late Monday, but I managed to fit in their lunch special.  

The portion size for lunch is just that, nothing overwhelming.  I got the yellow Thai curry and the mint leaf, which were both mediocre at best.  Do not order mild, as the spice level were completely lacking.  Taking into consideration this was Thai food, I usually tend to order mild expecting a lot more spice based on the traditional chili used.  I was sorely wrong and regretted not ordering medium to spicy to get the whole experience.

The beef in my mint leaf was lacking any basil flavor, any mint flavor and absolutely no spice.  The Thai curry had the color, but I didn't care too much for the big chunks of potatoes or carrots.  I would say the smaller pieces would have done better and once again no spice in the mild level.  The only upside to both dishes, were the meats were tender.  With the lunch special, it came with a salad, eggroll and a bowl of soup.  I was excited about the soup even though it was a little heavy handed on the salt.
