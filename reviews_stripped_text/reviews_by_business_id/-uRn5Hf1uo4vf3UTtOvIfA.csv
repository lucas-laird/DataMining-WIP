Not very far from my house and the food was great. Now it is a Don Tortaco . Since the change in name the service has really gone down hill. I made one trip a while back when they first changed their name and two recent visits. The last two times I was handed my food in a bag as if it was a to go order. Don't hand me my food in a bag, what am I not welcome in your restaurant? 

Anyway, I ordered the Carne Asada Chimichanga the first trip. The thing was over cooked a bit but passable. It didn't have as much cheese as the Robertos item and wasn't quite as good. The second trip I order the two beef taco combination plate and my taco shells were way over cooked. I had to wait for my drink while the cashier decided to take another order. On top of this the rice and beans that come with the combination plate were just very bland.

I'm not going here again.",dnp-e7SBVygsGo0TQXGTWQ,1,0,1,CMyCzxrmaZVcyWo_gTTtYQ

565402,2014-07-01,0,-uRn5Hf1uo4vf3UTtOvIfA,"I came to Don Tortaco expecting it to be a slightly better version of Robertos. I was wrong. The decor might be better, but the food is a notch below. The carne asada fries lacked flavor and had chunks of fat in it. I've never seen such large chunks of fat in any Robertos I've ever had.  The meat seemed to lack flavor, didn't remind me of the carne asada fries that I love.

The staff is a whole other story. Hard to find anyone to order from. Lady at the front desk is extremely inattentive and will literally run away from you to the back so she can play on her phone and play music. My girlfriend walked up to ask for a cup of water, after the cook sees her, he runs off to the side and starts chatting with the cashier. Most unacceptable behavior I've seen anywhere in a long time.


There are too many Robertos nearby that are much better for the same price. No reason to ever come to this place and their insultingly rude staff.",fVtopQWYo8Iuu5tSpb2mqQ,3,0,1,Cm2jyRKQocCjNLMVtd7hGQ

The food was phenomenal, cheap and big servings! I had a lengua burrito that was fairly big and my wife had a chicken enchilada plate with beans and rice. All of their food is fresh, and super tasty.

Cashier was reluctant to take our order let alone answer our questions or react to our comments. She yelled across the room, while holding up the tray and staring out direction, ""food ready"" like we knew she was speaking to us. By the time we realized she was yelling at us, she seemed thoroughly annoyed (because walking the food to our table is not convenient). The food was not tasty; tacos greasy and chicken dry.

1976623,2014-11-26,0,-uRn5Hf1uo4vf3UTtOvIfA,"Decent local Mexican food chain: menu has plates, tacos, burritos, and chimichangas. Menu isn't much different from Roberto's but this location is a little less casual- shares space with a PT's next door.

Fish tacos are tasty, though the chunk of fish is a little smaller than other comparably-priced tacos in town. California Burrito is just about $6, which is decent pricing for a massive portion. Three-piece rolled tacos are extra crispy- a bit too fried, actually. The upcharge for adding guac gets you a ton, though. Too bad it isn't fresh, seemed to be a premade mix which is tragic for a Mexican restaurant.

Service was friendly. Outdated tube TV in the dining room. Lots of seating, including on the porch. Entrance is weirdly placed, go all around the patio by the Marie Callendar's entrance.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,0,3,x6gI-GzPTrSnvvbwowPZVA

Food: 3/5 The food was delicious, a lot of meats, a huge glop of guacamole and ton's of onions, tomato's, cilantro, and lime on top. I noticed that the flour taco was very flimsy. Maybe it was over loaded or something but it ripped easy. Which is a big no no.. made my meal pretty messy. 

Price: 5/5 The price was very chip it was Al la carte per taco $2.35 for Carne Asada. My meal came to $5 and some change for 2 fully loaded Carne Asada Tacos.
