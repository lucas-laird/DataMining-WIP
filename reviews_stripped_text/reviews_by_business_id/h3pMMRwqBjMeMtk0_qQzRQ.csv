6498,2017-08-14,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"My husband and I were looking for some place new to try and we are so happy to have found this little gem. It's a little off the beaten path (Rancho & Craig area), but what a great find! We were there this past Friday night, and although they were busy, we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. 

We had the Salmon appetizer with a balsamic demi glaze and it was incredibly flavorful. Then I had the Blackened Salmon (super delicious) and my husband had the Pork Tenderloin for dinner. My husband's pork was a little over done and the owner Sean came over immediately to make him a new one. He was definitely very concerned to do whatever it took to make sure we had a great experience! That level of service from the owner himself and our terrific server is something that is sorely lacking in so many places out there nowadays.

We enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant with the decor and white lights, the 3 piece band playing was a nice touch on a Friday night, and great food & wine. We will definitely make this a regular spot from now on and recommend it to all our friends!",lAf-BuPap9KgZZQYoP-XDA,0,0,5,bJ9CSEmLP0nUyKcbmJvL5g

It took forever to choose entrees from the menu, but not a single one of us was disappointed. 

Their ac is down so it was really hot throughout the meal but other than that everything was really great. 
They're not too expensive either, with an awesome happy hour/lunch menu. 

We will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu!",HRrY-Btr-5w-TArnl7jBKw,0,0,5,KFQk6199aHOdk8umi0j5pA

29787,2013-02-02,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"This place was a great surprise! We had a coupon for 40 dollars off your check, so we went to check it out. The restaurant itself is the only remarkable thing in it's shopping center, smack in the middle with a terrace for additional seating. The atmosphere is very nice, with white paper tablecloths and faux candles on each table. Because of it's intimate design, with close together tables and soft lighting, this place is ideal for a date. 

Once we were seated, our waiter came almost immediately to take our drink order. They offered a wine list, but we declined. Most of their wines were well priced, however. Our drinks were brought swiftly, and then our waiter told us the specials for the day, printed on a large blackboard at the back of the restaurant. The appetizer we ordered was a bruschetta with various cheeses (honey goat cheese, for example) paired with either a fruit or a meat. I didn't care for the shrimp and mascarpone cheese one, but my boyfriend loved the strong fish flavor. The others were absolutely delicious, and the drizzle of balsamic reduction over the small salad in the middle made the plating beautiful. They also bring you fresh bread, which was absolutely divine. It comes with an oil and vinegar dip with a squeeze of lemon that was delicious and, sadly, I filled up on bread before my entree even came. (No regrets, the bread was just too good.)

The entrees were amazing. Absolutely divine. I had read some reviews of the restaurant that scared me a bit, saying that the food was overpriced, but I can't say I agree at all. My boyfriend got one of their specialty pizzas, well priced at fourteen dollars, and it was plenty big for two people, let alone one. The pizza came with salami, prosciutto, and jalapenos, but I sadly can't remember all of the ingredients. I got the chicken 'Riggies', rigatoni pasta with chicken, peppers, and a marinara sauce, spicy level 2 (out of 4). It was a ridiculously large portion, oozing with mozzarella cheese and perfectly cooked pasta. The flavor was great, and you could pick out all of the subtle flavors of the chicken, individual peppers, and the sauce. I have absolutely no complaints about any of the food from here, except that it ended at some point. 

At one point during the meal, the co-owner came and talked with us about how we liked the food and the restaurant. He was wonderfully polite and quite the gentleman, and we left the place feeling very welcome and excited to come back. 

The single complaint I have about this restaurant was that the music was a little too loud, but it was live, and she was a good singer, so it was fine. I'm so excited to go back and I hope you try Mezzo!",wkKnzTG93gutdDWJpjwDQQ,2,1,5,KRX8xyawI_bV4EnIqYs0KA

Food finally came out and a huge portion of Veal Parmesan arrived along with a perfectly cooked med-rare filet. This is a good place to eat the only thing I would not recommend is their Sangria, it tastes like grape juice.

129256,2015-05-09,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I've had dinner here several times. After my lunch experience today I am not sure I will ever return.
For starters I was  charged a dollar for a TO GO order. I highly dislike being charged  for the few steps I took on my own accord to pick up my food. I understand charging for a delivery fee. However, I walked from literally next door. And, when I placed the order not once did they mention there'd be a charge.
I ordered with at least fifteen minutes notice of when I needed the food and was told my order would be ready for pick up within ten minutes. Upon my arrival not only was there no greeter at the door, my food had not yet been prepared. As I am on a limited amount of time for lunch this was an inconvenience.
I ordered the Brie grilled cheese sandwich. It should be renamed to a grilled bread with mushrooms, onions and perhaps some cheese sandwich. I paid good money for a sandwich that did not have much of the main ingredient-cheese.
I was highly disappointed and WILL NOT be ordering lunch there again.",oKQL3iTLuXdPE7nvcqekwQ,0,0,1,Y8MKLJUxPGECG7HROWE_bA

There was plenty of chicken and pasta for the two of them. We split the penne ala vodka (substituted for fettuccini) with blackened shrimp.

199661,2010-10-18,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I would love to give this place at least 4 stars - Buuuuuut the service was horrid.

Starters included - house salad with an apple/pear vinaigrette and the Italian wedding soup.  The salad was crisp fresh greens with a sliced strawberry and ricotta - SKIP the chick peas on the plate, it threw the bitter/sweet taste south.  Wedding soup was tasty - till you near the bottom where the bowl was encrusted with grated SALTY cheese - WOO too much.  The back-server filled and when I say filled I mean FILLED a bowl with EVOO and maybe added a tablespoon of balsamic for our bread.  So much oil you couldn't reach the balsamic.

If you want water or butter you have to ask for it.

Dinner - 5 oz filet and the chicken piccata.  The filet was super tender and the pecorino romano garlic herb sauce on it was delicious - the ""garlic"" mashed potatoes lacked taste.  Chicken piccata, was tasty cooked thoroughly - too many capers...and it was served with a side of zesty marinara over ziti.  IMO - I would have complimented this dish with a garlic oil linguine.  

Dessert - nothing thrilling, did not order, although the pizza frite seemed interesting - I'm sure it was their version of Zeppole or fried doughboys.

Service was pitiful - our server was also the host and had to be reminded TWICE food was ready to be delivered.  His hand skills are lacking as well - he served our neighboring table a bowl with his thumb in it.  Gross.

Price wasn't too bad - $55.00 for a party of two - that was with soft drinks and no dessert.  We made a reservation, which was unnecessary as the restaurant was quiet.  

Would I go there again?  Yes, in comfy jeans, to sit at the wine bar and order a wood fired pizza. :)",NSQlBoFlgtWmPgBpjz0n1w,4,1,3,-EKfLxHtfOvsqx1Rn6mL8A

290019,2014-03-31,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Tried today for first time after church. We were first table there and ordered quickly. Nothing special ordered--a margherita pizza, two cups of soup, salad and cheeseburger. Soups were bowls (guess they don't sell a cup), served quickly along with one salad (one party's entree).  Then we saw other tables order, be served and finish their meals before we received notification, after flagging down a manager, that our other two entrees were to be out shortly. We saw one sitting in the window for about 10 minutes and were curtly corrected by manager that it was only  2 minutes and it was plenty hot. Finally, 40 minutes after ordering, the cheeseburger still warm, and the pizza arrived. Pizza was icky, and was not liked by any of us. We were told that since it took so long to get to us (which we were curtly instructed again that pizza takes time to cook---excuse me but I worked in a pizza restaurant and know it doesn't take FORTY MINUTES), my friend was given a coupon to discount a future meal. She lives about 25 miles from the restaurant and said she wouldn't be back; asked manager for a discount instead and said if he would provide customer service she would not give a bad review. He was very short with us and said the coupon was all he would do and walked away, knowing that most of the pizza was left and that some of it was burnt. We were stunned at this manager's rudeness. Paid the bill and left and WILL NEVER RETURN.  And, we know plenty of people across the valley and are long-time, well-connected residents. We will advise people to stay away, unless they want mediocre food and a rude management.

My dad decided that he didn't want lasagna, so he went for the Salmon. He also had the Italian wedding soup which I had gotten to taste and I would recommend that. During our dinner, we had live music that is calming and it wasn't loud at all, which is perfect. There's also a wine bar and outdoor patio. I only saw 2 flatscreen TV in the space which was good enough, given that this place is suited for an intimate/romantic setting.

346053,2012-05-22,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"My husband and I finally made a stop here for dinner after driving by dozens of times.  We had almost stopped in before, but decided against it after seeing the prices.  This time I came armed with coupon in hand.

It's a cute little restaurant with comfortable chairs and a patio for outdoor dining.  It has a Tuscan feel and would make a great spot to meet up with some friends.  It wasn't too busy when we came so we were taken care of right away.

They start you off with fresh bread and a side of oil and vinegar.  The bread was light and fluffy and the oil and vinegar were good quality.  I do think it would be better if they could serve the oil and vinegar on a plate instead of the bowl they served ours in- it was difficult to mix the two ingredients.  The first few bites of bread were covered in oil only and then only vinegar towards the end.

We ordered a house salad to share before our entrees.  It was large enough to share as an appetizer, but it wouldn't be big enough to order as a meal at dinner.  The salad was pretty standard but also came with chickpeas and ricotta.  The chickpeas were a little bland but the ricotta was a nice touch.  The vinaigrette was tasty and light and the salad was dressed perfectly, however, the veggies weren't very fresh which always makes me sad.

I ordered the eggplant parmesan.  I was a little nervous because the menu stated that it wasn't fried... Who doesn't fry eggplant parm?  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was breaded and baked to provide a nice crunch while eliminating all that greasiness many fried eggplant parms have.  This entree comes with a small side of penne with marinara, which was ok but the sauce was a little too sweet for me.  Pasta aside, the eggplant is a good dish.

My husband had the vegetable lasagna.  He enjoyed it, but I wasn't as fond of it as the eggplant parm.  There was a bit too much ricotta and I think the mushrooms might have been a little old.  Also, there was something else that tasted off to me.... I want to say nutmeg but I'm not sure.  

Our server was great and our water glasses never got less than half full before someone refilled it.  The only problem we had was that it seemed to take forever to get our food.  Not sure why considering there weren't too many people in the restaurant while we were there.

We found out that they have happy hour from 4 pm- 8 pm Monday through Saturday.  $3 for house wine and beer, and I think $3 or $4 for well drinks.  They also offer half off some of the appetizers.  This is only at the bar.

I'm interested in coming back for happy hour and maybe ordering a pizza.  The bar was nice and would make a good after-work date with my husband.  I'm not sure if I'd come back for dinner though- the only way I would consider it is with another coupon.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,1,2,eP91T9cLasDB-jTHRYIYHQ
368558,2017-08-07,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"We have been going to Mezzo's since they opened in 2012.  We have probably eaten there 22-24 times.  I have never written a review, for what reason, I do not know, I should have,  because they are Top-Of-The-Mark .  So this is a long overdue review of one of the best Italian Restaurants in Las Vegas.  

Mezzo's food has been consistently EXCELLENT every time we have eaten there.  Their Chicken Riggie is the best I have ever had.  Their Meat Lasagna is superb - you will think Momma Made It. Their Salmon Mediterranean is out of this world!  Last night I had the Peach Caprese salad special and the Chicken Riggie (3rd time), both were exceptional culinary delights!!  

If you want to enjoy a superb Italian meal from a family owned business that really hits it out of the park EVERY TIME, give Mezzo's a try.  If you are a wine connoisseur, Sean has some exceptional wines to complement every meal.  And before I end this review, the one dish that Mezzo's serves that you will think came straight out of Little Italy in Boston or New York is their  Frutti Di Mare.  Have not had it in a few months but the last time I ordered it, it truly captured the original intent of seafood and linguini.  Give Mezzo's a chance to steal your heart and stomach.",JBP6vSGi7rss93_GfJEE1A,0,0,5,W-eLSOpCEAYCIkM8w5LMPg

We were seated and ignored.  Waioters walked all areound us and were busy setting tables and other routine tsks rather than focused on the customers, us.  It was not crowded, yet the was no time to offer us drinks or ask our menu choice.

They constantly checked if we liked the food and filled our drinks. The complimentary bread was soft and warm, served with balsamic vinegar and olive oil with a little piece of lemon in it, which give it an interesting flavor. We ordered the Mezzo Trio Sampler - stuffed mushrooms we/cheese, fried avocado w/lime crème fresh, and fried ravioli w/a balsamic glaze. Everything was great, but the avocado was awesome!!! For entrees, we had the Veal Marsala and the Pasta Primavera w/fresh vegetables and shrimp. My husband declared the veal, the best he's ever had. The vegetables in the primavera were definitely fresh and not overcooked, the shrimp was blackened. Again just a small twist on a classic. Big portions. For dessert, we had the cannoli. Nicely presented with extra white and chocolate chips and strawberries, and it was delicious. Rich but not obnoxious. We will definitely be back.

First of all, any of you been to this place, the tables are very close together.  So, after we were seated and ordered our food, another couple sat next to us.  Well, there was a guy talking to the other couple next for about 15-20 mins at a time, well he scooted between the tables and his BUTT was literally next to our appetizer, wine glass, and face.  He was so rude.  Not once he realize what he was doing, we scooted the table away from him, it just gave him more room to scoot towards us.  We kept moving it 'til it was joining the other table.  It was gross, completely ruining our evening.

To top things off, the lasagna was cold in the middle and really lacked flavor, so was the blackened salmon dish.  We did have a pretty good glass of wine, no question about that.  That was the only good thing out of that place.

After our meal, we mentioned it to the waitress, and she said the guy we were referring to was the owner.  You would think the owner would have been more courteous  towards his customers, but hey he's the owner.  If that's the way he wants to run his restaurant, then we are definitely not going back.

If you like the owner's BUTT in your face or the smell of BUTT, this is absolutely the best place to go all day long and would highly recommend it.  If this is your preference, please change my 1 star to 5 stars.",YnNVCAOcHQfmece1gBW5fw,4,3,1,LirQC2ns7GiJcH7MhqfA9g

I put on a dress and even broke out the heels and dressy purse. When we arrived, the host informed us that no matter if we waited at the bar or not, we would not get a table. I explained that I had called and was told we'd be able to be seated for dinner and he rudely denied that I was told this information. When I explained that we drove across town based on the phone call I had placed at 5pm, I was, essentially told it did not matter; unless I wanted to wait until after 9pm, I was not getting a table and he began addressing the couple behind me; I was dismissed!

My fiancee ordered the orrechiette housemade pasta (around $14) and it was very good although the texture was a little different (not melt in your mouth and somewhat thick). It had a good spicy flavor since he chose to get Italian sausage instead of sweet sausage. We were too full by the end of dinner to have dessert but each had an espresso.

The decor is typical Italian bistro-ish and nicely lit. The music choice and volume were appropriate for the decor and time of day. We were seated promptly and looked at the menu boards by the kitchen for the specials.
My friend was right, the wine list is great! While not extensive by the glass....very reasonable and anyone would be able to find something suited to their palate and price range. We asked what the ($6) house red was and were informed it was our choice of Tobin James Cabernet or Merlot. These were on the menu at $10 a glass, so I clarified what the house red was and got the same answer. I got the cab and my partner got a glass of Fat Cat Pinot. Both were lovely and we both ordered a second glass of the cab (especially at the price!)

We ordered the Mediterranean salmon and the Baked Portobello appetizer, but as an entree over linguine. The salmon was plated beautifully and was nice....not out of this world, but edible and seasoned appropriately. A bowl was brought for the mussel shells and sauce was tasty, but not epic and not Ginas!

The Portobello plate came with no spinach and was sloppily presented, like they slid it on the plate in a hurry and it barely made it on; no garnish and the plate not wiped. The 4 cheeses were very, very rich and the dish was salty (probably owing to all the cheese) but tasty, especially once I asked for the spinach which they wilted perfectly and cut the richness down to a tolerable level.

Service started well and overall no major complaints except when we needed wine or the spinach it took a quite a few minutes to get our server's attention. In his defense, the place filled up with large tables (good for them, nice to see it is popular) and those take time, so we understood. I think I would have staffed one more bus person/food runner to help keep things going to the table, water filled up, etc. We did notice food sitting at the kitchen counter for quite awhile...luckily it wasn't ours!

Bill was reasonable ($65 for 2 people) even though we were actually charged $10 a glass for the wine, not the $6, but it was delicious and one glass was left off.....so no complaints:)

We might  come back for the wine and some appetizers, and depending on the service and food then might bring friends for a casual dinner that is close to home. If you are in the area, it is worth a stop and I think when the patio opens in the summer it will be even better!",1llLRrB6uFwACTleMfoYuA,4,1,3,P1P0LpbWOzLRTqdiY_wsFA

was looking forward to going the evening of Sep 29th 2017 with my girlfriend, called to make reservations for 730, spoke to Kelly. 
Kelly mentioned that there's probably going to be a wait even with reservations. I asked if we'd have to wait long? kelly wasn't sure. i asked kelly just for an approximate idea of a wait time as we were coming from the other side of town and really didnt feel like standing around for an hour just to be seated. usually when we go to a restaurant we're ready to dine when we get there. Of course when you also have a reservation, you just figure you'll be seated fairly quickly. 

I asked to speak to a manager to see if maybe they could give me an idea of a wait time, maybe just an average time based on the regular attendance for that particular day of the week ? SOMEBODY ?? ANYBODY ?? 
well Kelly once again with her VERY uncertain and poor customer service/unsure attitude, She said MAYBE one could call me back. Maybe ?? Well.....it is now December 7th 2017 and still no call back. Completely ok as there are no shortage of great restaurants in this town and 10 TIMES BETTER THE CUSTOMER SERVICE I EXPERIENCED WITH MEZZO. 
 
i just felt the need to point out the horrible customer service i received.

Yes, the place is beautiful, but with 12 customers in the place already served it took AN HOUR to get our food! We had to leave when a couple came in after us and was served before us. Their remark was it takes time...we bought our steaks and cooked them ourselves. I also hated the fact that we went back in February and it was freezing inside, so I kept on my heavy jacket. To sum it up, we were cold, food took over an HOUR, and we still went home hungry. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!",J0N1UOP8DNdb3fpKt-sBmQ,0,0,1,nG1EdnjkiMBSbNzVH4AXmA
975029,2013-07-12,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"So I have driven by this place a million times thinking ""I gotta get there sometime"".  The consensus that I've heard was that the place was fantastic and had great wine.  We had a Groupon $20 for $45 which is always featured so I recommend that because why wouldn't you if its there and your going to dine there anyway.

Immediately when you walk in your eyes are drawn the candles that are lit everywhere and directly in front of you is the redish orange unique chandallier.  Pretty neat.  Ambiance just punched you in the face. I had been here before this became Mezzos and don't remember the details as much as I did this time.  The ceiling is dropped down creating a circled effect which I thought added a lot of character to the place.  To your right is a little sectioned off party room/section that would be good for a large party.  To the left is the bar area which I really didn't get to check out closely being that we were seated on the other side closer to the kitchen.  

The server and guy assisting him were fabulous, attentive and very nice.  I believe the owner was there, however he never greeted us. 

I ordered my glass of Chardonnay and they didn't have my first choice.  Soo I ordered my second choice.  It wasn't too shabby but $10 a glass.  I hate the mark up on wine sometimes. The BF was disappointed they didn't have mixed drinks so he just ordered a soda.  

The bread came out right away.  Reminded me of some bread that I make at home.  Crusty on the outside and doughy on the inside....warm and delightful.  It accompanied a small bowl of oil and balsalmic.  Too much oil for my taste.  I kinda like more of the balsalmic but it was still really good.  We ordered the Caesars salad to share and it was perrrfect.

For my entree I ordered the penne ala vodka with chicken as an add-on.  It came out and looked amazing.  There was way too much chicken though - SAID NO ONE EVER - except for ME!  Sorry.  I like more noodles and a hint of chicken.  There was a lot of chicken and a lot of sauce.  All was tasty to say the least and 1/2 went home for leftovers.  BF ordered the chicken parm with a side of penne with marinara.  This was ALOT of chicken too but he wasn't complaining.  It almost felt like 3 portions...no kidding.  Needless to say we brought some of that home as well.

Overall a great experience.  Ambiance is a 5.  It has outdoor seating that would be amazing to enjoy if it wasn't over 100 degrees outside right now.  I think with our Groupon we only spent $15 over that.  Nice little date night and a definite need to go back and bring friends!  

BTW- the leftovers were BOMBdiggity the day after.  Better than the meal itself.  Big fan.",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,4,3,4,s50m9PS7cW4LDyBdsohrmA

Service was slow to appear, when he finally greeted us,without any introduction, the waiter, name unknown, first asked if we wanted water, when we declined he left without asking about any other drink orders. When he returned to take our food order he again tried to leave without asking about drinks, even though 1 in our party ordered coffee. I caught him and ordered the drinks. The meatball app and the mushroom apps were outstanding, lots of flavor, the reason it gets 2 stars. We thought if this is an indication the dinner should be great. The lasagna was flavorless and totally ""unremarkable"" per 1 in my party. If there was ricotta cheese in it it was old and lost all flavor. He said he could only taste the noodles, everything else had no taste. Another had the salmon special, salmon with a white coating over risotto. Salmon just OK, risotto no flavor, no seasoning and undercooked, stuck to your teeth and a little crunchy. The eggplant parm was NOWHERE near the flavor of the lunch serving. Flavor was bland and seemed undercooked, WAY too much cheese, not enough flavor. My steak milinase was steak beaten flat, to remove all taste, and coated with something that did not have much flavor and didn't accent the steak at all, tasted kind of like Sizzler chicken fried steak, with less coating and less flavor. Toward the middle of the meal someone, again name unknown,  not even sure he worked there, asked how our dinner was. We asked about the lasagna prep and were told it was made that way on purpose, without much seasoning as were the rest of what we had. The waiter only returned 1 time to check on us, right after the entree's were served.

He knew it was my first time. Order appetizer meatballs which had a great balance of flavors.  Ceasar salad was great not over powering with a good balance of dressing...just right mixture. Entree of chicken marsala  took longer than anticipated as the table next to me who sat after got their entree first. Cheese bread came after entree and not together. Marsala very tasty and came with a bed of noodles. No dessert to full. I observed many return customers. If the entree didn't take too long I would have rated 5 stars as well as the bread came after I finished the first half of my meal. Server said they burnt the first order. My disappointments is that a restaurant this caliber should have grated parmigiano and the garlic cheese bread needs some help...something in the frozen section  tastes a lot better.,dC9pqTxOJ18Zjh6r5otwSA,0,0,4,P21ZZHFUujkeqp2LduanyA

We didn't want to take up a table for this so when we walked in we told the greeter that we just wanted some drinks and appetizers and hoped to sit at the bar. There were only a couple of empty seats and they were not together.

His response as he pointed to an empty chair at the bar, ""There's one there. Knock yourselves out."" His tone and body language were dismissive. He then turned to someone else.

SO glad I did! My husband and I had a great experience, and I'm sure we will be returning, even at full price.

It was prom night, so the place was pretty packed, but we were seated right away, even without a reservation. We each had a house salad ($5 each), which was nothing special, and we split a bottle of good Chianti ($36). I had the veal parmesan ($24), which was tasty and served with a large portion of penne pasta. Sauce was a little plain, but the meat was cooked nicely.

The standout of the meal was my husband's fettucine alfredo ($16, or free for us with the coupon). Whenever we try a new Italian restaurant, that's his standard order to gauge the place, and he said this was among the best he's ever had. I tried a bite, and I would have to concur.

So the food was good and the prices were reasonable (especially when using a half-off coupon!). My only complaint is that it's a little dark inside.

My Better Half was rather disappointed by this fact, since she assumed we knew by her answer to the question ""Do you have Sweet Tea?"" as ""We Have Iced Tea"".  Some might have said ""We have Passion Fruit Tea"" but 'fortunately' her experience convinced her otherwise.

Overall, an average Italian experience for me.  They allow you to chose your own level of spiciness on a scale of 1 to 4. I said 3, but I felt more like that was the piquance level for babies. But perhaps it was more that my Frutti Di Mare does not lend itself well to spiciness.

After settling in, the waiter told us it was a holiday and we would not be able to use it. I was pretty annoyed, because technically Nevada day is the 31st. But whatever, we stayed and ordered the pre-fixed dinner special which includes app, entree (2 options) and desert as well as a wine with each for $60 total.  

The pizza app this evening was delish. It was some kind of pizza with peaches and balsamic reduction on it, which sounds weird but it flowed well with the additional toppings. I got the chicken special (cant recall the name of it) which was served over angelhair pasta and had mushrooms and a wine sauce. It was okay, nothing that made me melt. In fact, I barely remember it or what was in it. My boyfriend got the same thing and agreed that it was just alright. The desert was just okay too. 

We went back last night to finally use the groupon. We had an extremely nice waitress and it was very slow. We skipped apps and just ordered entrees. He got the chicken Riggies (sp?) and I got the chicken piccata. Again, just okay/average. Mine lacked any real flavor and was just bland, I tried sprucing it up with crushed red pepper. The chicken was not browned at all and had no golden coloring anywhere, just pure white and not very appealing to the eye. I tried his and thought it was better than mine, but he got it too spicy (you choose the level of spice) he agreed he should have went down a number on the scale. He thought his was just okay as well. 

This place is not bad, but not great. Just kind of whatever. We had pretty good service each time so good job there. They need more menu options. I don't eat fish or pork, and there is only 2 chicken entree dishes and one steak option on the entire menu. There is only about 4 or 5 pasta dish options. I think they can add more chicken entrees and make more options available. I had a hard time choosing something, because the options underwhelmed me and nothing sounded that great. We probably wont be back, especially since we don't live in the area, and the food just isn't worth the drive.",P5neFGzLzxsvFLFEhxKx3w,3,0,3,T9ZWSr5XUtR_KtyxM8r4Lw

Appetizer wise, I enjoy their calamari ($11) and their meat and cheese platter ($16).  Their calamari is served with marinara- I wish it came with some kind of lemon or garlic aioli.

I stick to the same dish every single time I am here... cus well- if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Their filet is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  It comes served with a gorgonzola cream sauce which is to die for!  There is pancetta on top of the filet, and it is served with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  My husband usually gets their salmon entree and  really enjoys that as well.

The last time we were here was Tuesday at 6 PM.  We hadn't been here in a few months, but as we were leaving (7 PM), they were getting ready to start a Trivia Night, which seemed fun.  The game is just for fun, but I did hear that you could earn desserts for making jokes, lol.  I would like to come back for this next time!

Wow I am never one to really complain so I had to exercise extreme control to not embarrass my husband! 
We sat down for dinner at about 6:35 p.m. which I had a reservation for party of 6.  It was a cold night and they sat us at a front table by the door so we froze the entire time!  Strike 1
Then we ordered 2 salads and 3 pastas + filet steak.
The salads (antipasto for 2 and chopped) took like 35 min?!  BUT they were both very yummy dressings and good portion sizes for the table to share, along with the fresh bread they provided started to turn things around.
The entree's finally came like 15 min later.  Shrimp scampi and lasagna were VERY good.  Spaghetti was fine and Gorgonzola Filet was good.
Best thing was the homemade cheesecake.

I have yet to be disappointed with a single dish. Their antipasto salad is a great way to start out the meal. It serves 2-4 people and will get your taste buds going for the main course. As for entrees, it may be simple, but the eggplant parmesan is wonderful. Also, pay attention to the specials. There are often creative and great daily dishes. For dessert, the tiramisu is divine. The wine list is solid and they will often have wine specials. The decor is decent, but a little too cookie-cutter Italian for my tastes.

I had the mushroom over spinach with cheese as an appetizer. It was in a tub of cheesy cream sauce. Way to heavy for my taste. It would have been much better with just a touch of sauce.
The veal piccata actually had a lovely sauce with angel hair pasta. Unfortunately the veal was really chewy. Not sure whether it was the quality or the prep. 
My husband has a gluten allergy. He had a severe reaction to his dinner. We're not sure what it was from. Perhaps the GF pasta wasn't cooked in separate water. Don't know. I wouldn't recommend it for the gluten intolerant.

Decor was nice and prompt greeting upon entering.  Seated right away, they had about half the room full on a Friday night.  Usually busier as I have driven by before and seen it packed.  Here is the only reason it receives 4 and not 5 stars.  Server or the assistant.  We had to ask 2-3 times just to get some glasses of water for us.  They kept the other drinks full but did not bring water until we continually asked.  Other than that, our server was prompt to greet us.  He did take a few minutes to take our order which we were very hungry.  But food came out of the kitchen very promptly.  And now the taste was excellent.  Definitely up with some of the better ones I've tasted around town.  My wife had eggplant parm, which we really enjoyed as it was not breaded and that helped to not retain so much grease from the frying.  I had chicken picata which I really enjoyed.

The restaurant wasn't busy at all. Maybe three tables were occupied.

They also have an outside sitting area that faces the parking lot so the time it takes to get served and have your bill delivered you can eat and hop right into your car and leave and I bet that they won't even know you're missing.

After we finished our meals it took the waiter another 15 minutes to bring our bill to us.

If you're a fan of standard well made Italian American fare then this place is for you, lots of old standards, nothing new or crazy that jumps at you, but that's okay. You get large portions of American classics and they're very reasonably priced. 

I also had a latte there because I was feeling in a bit of a slump when I got there and it blew every chain latte I've ever had out of the water. 

My only complaint is that their sides and small items seem a little pricey, but its entirely acceptable because of the large portions you get. My girlfriend ordered Spaghetti and Italian Sausage from the dinner menu ($15) and got two big filling meals out of it. 

My Chicken Parmesan was some of the best I can remember having in quite a long time. If I ate it it one sitting I'd be ready to pop.

First impression started w immediately sitting down to have a long black hair across my plate..
Meatballs came out and although they were super tender and moist there was no flavor!
About an hr after our arrival a man was walking around (I'll guess the owner). Twice we saw him talk to employees on the dining floor which was very unprofessional. 
The young guy who brought out dessert and extra napkins seemed to have absolutely no restaurant experience. ""Uhh, someone asked for these?"" ""Here's your forks.""

The Good, the Bad, and the Office Supplies

It pains me to write this because I really liked this place, but Yelp is all about honest and useful reviews, right? Brace yourself.

In the past two years have I visited Mezzo Bistro about five or six times. The atmosphere is nice, the food is really good, and the wine selection is pretty decent. I have always had a pleasant experience so why would this time be any different? Anticipating my next trip to Vegas, I bought a Groupon for $22 towards lunch because it was one of my favorite off-Strip restaurants. 

Was.

Around 11:30am on 10/30/13, my husband and I went in for lunch. We ordered Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Piccata, and Caesar salads. The salads came out and the first couple of bites were delicious, as always. But then, without any warning, I bit down on something hard. Something crunchy and solid. I immediately spit it into my napkin and looked to see what the hell it was. 

A pushpin. 

I felt the blood drain from my face. Are you freaking kidding me?! A pushpin? In a salad? How does that even happen? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the manager's desk and everything inside it should not be anywhere near the food prep area. I don't even understand how that happened. It fell into the bowl and got mixed in with the lettuce and croutons? What the hell, people?!

So I took a photo of it because there's no way anyone in the world would believe such a ridiculous thing could happen. My husband called the waitress over to show her what had happened. She seemed unimpressed. He then asked to speak to the manager. The waitress went in the back and talked to the manager, but when she came back out she went behind the bar and busied herself and ignored us entirely. Really? That's how you handle such a crisis? That's your customer service policy? To ignore it and hope it goes away? Wow.

Fine. So we left the Groupon on the table and walked out. 

I was completely freaked out by that experience. That could have gone so badly, for me and for the restaurant. If I had bitten down on it the wrong way, or swallowed it, that was gonna be a bad day for everybody. 

My husband wrote a Yelp review later that day. He included the photo I took of the white pushpin. We all know businesses read their reviews online. To date, not one person, management, legal or otherwise, from Mezzo Bistro has contacted us. Unreal.

This is the only bad thing I have to say about this restaurant. But it's a pretty damn bad thing. Dine at your own risk.",PP7mV3SKVhtkuhwUDHUJXQ,16,5,1,1MC7M-wKsQGj9dztLLY-jw

They have a great list of lunch specials, from $6-10 apps, soups, salads, and sandwiches, to pastas in the $10-14 range: extremely reasonable pricing. Quality is decent, items we had were hit or miss.

MUSHROOM & BRIE GRILLED CHEESE: Name is a bit of a misnomer, as this sandwich didn't appear to be grilled at all, but how can you go wrong with cheese and mushrooms?! Massive amount of cheese, plentiful portion of 'shrooms, buttery bread. 
ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP: This was an unusual take on a classic soup, with tons of fresh, shredded chicken and only two or three tiny meatballs? Lots of fresh veggies (carrots and spinach) in this dish though, and a generous portion for $6. Broth was perfectly seasoned.
CHICKEN PICCATA: A delicious version of a classic dish! Thin chicken cutlet is nicely seasoned in a flavorful sauce with al dente angel hair. Simple and well done.
PASTA SALAD: This was the featured side of the day, with my sandwich, and I did not care for it at all. Rather than an oil-and-vinegar or Italian-dressing-based mix, this was made with balsamic vinegar? Flavors did not work for me, though I will say the portion included several large pieces of artichoke, which was a nice touch.

Service was professional, interior is nicely appointed and on the upscale side. Though pricing is great for lunch, this seems like more of a date-night spot- and that's what I'd come back to try. Along with a glass of that Malbec.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,2,3,e8yYshhvDSTgJUFhjE_Q-Q

Being a big Chicago Foodie and taking another Chicago foodie, I had my hesitation based on other yelp reviews. I have to say, we all loved this place and find this as a hidden gem close to us.  We had the portabello appetizer and an antipasto salad.  The portabello was so good and rich enough to be a pasta dish itself and the antipasto salad that was for two people, but enough for six.  I had the eggplant parmesan and it wasn't as fresh as I would like and was disappointed.  The meat lasagna was phenomenal and taste homemade.  The chicken parmesan was really fresh and the meat was real tender.  Even for a person who doesn't like chicken parmesan, I would consider ordering it myself next time.  Didn't have desserts as the entrees itself was so rich and filling.  Will have to try pizza next time and venture into dessert.  Our waiter was very courteous and attentive.  He kept coming around and did a phenomenonal job to make sure the drinks were filled and unused plates were bussed.  I don't know why the reviews were rated poorly and I'm glad that my friend enjoyed her experience here and will forgo other Italian restaurants.

Chicken Parmigiana dish for lunch was made up of one and a half pieces of chicken. The whole piece was OK, but the half piece tasted like it was reheated.

We started out with the caprese salad. Hard to screw up cheese, tomato and basil. It was good. Now back to our entrees... The veal was good albeit a tiny portion for the money. My wife's chicken was tender and flavorful... but for the love of Pete, how does and Italian bistro SCREW UP PASTA???? It was so over cooked, it was almost paste-like.
When we told the waiter, he simply asked if we'd like another order of pasta. Nice gesture, but no thanks.

The ambiance is nice. The salad is acceptable. The entrees with paste like pasta... not so great!

Service was so slow. The food has always taken some time, I used to attribute the time was a thing for quality, but an hour wait time is TOO long on multiple occasions. Food tastes great, but quality has come down, and has been inconsistent. And by golly, can a girl get a refill?

Then came the entrees... my entree was mediocre and the girlfriend said hers was gross, I tried hers and sure enough it was terrible. I kept offering her to eat my dish instead but she didn't enjoy my dish either. I felt terrible considering I had suggested this place. To make things worse, the server never visited our table after delivering our entrees and both of our drinks went empty and stayed that way.

We came here to celebrate the engagement of friends on a Saturday night. There were 12 of us. 12 people (military), new to Vegas, that would most likely come eat here again and tell other people to come here if it was a good place to eat. 
From the beginning our server was rude. When asked if something was good he responded ""yeah... it's all good."".  I asked if he had any crackers as we had a squirmy 9 month old with us. He says ""No. No crackers.""
Finally after 10 more minutes of more whining I desperately ask if they have anything, even bread. That's when he brings out the bread for the table. Clearly he was not going to bring that out unless we asked for it. Nice. Don't get me wrong, I know I should have brought my own food for the baby, but I wouldn't have cared if the server even just said ""no, sorry, we don't have crackers."" He was just so short with us, it was offensive. 
There was a girl assisting him in refilling drinks, etc. Our drinks were refilled once and were never touched again. 
The thing that weirded us all out was when we ordered entrees the server said ""soup or salad?"" So we all picked our soup or salad. One of the peple with us asked him ""what kind of salad is it? Is it Ceasar?"" and he says ""yeah you can have that if you want."" At this point I was confused and asked what kind of salad we ordered and he said whatever we wanted, yet he didn't have us specify when we said salad. That's when it came to our attention the entrees didn't come with a side, he was just upselling and being extremely sneaky about it. 
Oh yes, and he corrected my husband on the proper pronunciation of the dish he ordered. Very professional. 
When we ordered I asked for separate tickets. 
The food came out relatively fast. It was good.
We were never asked if everything was good. 

Finally it was time to pay. He brought out one separate ticket and then grouped the other 9 people on one ticket, even though I asked for them to be divided when we ordered. When the other people asked for him to divide it he told us ""nobody but them asked for separate tickets.""

The gratuity was not added to our ticket and I only tipped 10%. The other people we were with did that same, if not less. After rudely collecting the tip slips before we were close to leaving, he slams down the girl's share of the money (for helping him) and she said ""THANKS"" (loudly) and glared at our table. Oh, that reminds me. They were shining silverware during the meal and I watched her pick something off our server's face as she had silverwear in one hand. After she was done getting his eyelash or whatever it was she went right back to touching the silverware. I wanted to gag. 

I have been a waitress. I know the job isn't easy, especially when you have bigger tables. But the place was pretty much dead on a Saturday night (I now understand why) and this guy didn't try, at all.  I don't think we will be back. And that makes me sad because that margherita pizza was damn good. So was the antipasto salad.

As with all italian restaurants after you are seated they bring over bread basket, but mezzos bread is fresh and instead of butter they serve a oil and basalmic vinegar with a hint of lemon that is quite delicious

One of the favorites we order is the pizza. Out favorite is the ""mezzo"" thin crusted with a generous amount of mozzarella and sausage...yummmm! Also the marinara ad red sauce they use with there dishes is amazing. You can Taste the freshness of the tomatoes and herbs they use. We always get extra sauce no matter what we order because it is that good! When we asked the owner how they make there sauce he said that the only use high quality herbs and produce and Everything is fresh.

Our favorite wine there is the 2012 Nicky Hahn Pinot noir. It is hands down one of the best Pinot noir I have ever tasted ad we always order a bottle when we come here.

It so has a full bar, but another key selling point beside the great food and wine is the ambiance of the restaurant low dimmed lights makes it very romantic, but you also don't feel that you have to be overly dressed up.

Food was about a 4 out of 5 stars. It was a pretty basic menu so didn't take forever to decide what to get. Service was horrible though. After we ordered our food we didn't see our waitress again for over 40 minutes... Or I should say she kept walking right by my table with her eyes locked forward and didn't even stop when I called to her to get her attention on 2 separate occasions. They weren't even busy. I kept hearing the other servers claim they were upset cause they didn't have anymore tables to sit. I eventually flagged down a different waiter and asked him if he could just get our check. He then was very helpful and bagged our leftovers, ect. But of course she was all smiles as she brought over our check after not speaking to us a single time after she took our order, but didn't once mention anything about not serving us. 
If the service had been better I would have done 4 stars and come back again, but I'd rather go to Olive Garden or bucca de bepo and get great/friendly service.",jR_ibPSnMmCfJgOr5GgctQ,0,0,2,XBQNXI3E3QkfkpH1VZuv2g

The waiter came and we ordered drinks.  They do not have a kids menu, but the waiter will just tell you what they have on the kids menu, which I thought was odd.  I thought they would at least place it in the regular menu but it turned out to not be a problem because my daughter knew exactly what she wanted and luckily they make it in small portion. She ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the chicken marsala, and my husband ordered the chicken riggies, spicy.  Everything was good and my husband's riggies was very spicy.  The wine list was decent,  and in all, a good experience. The only issue I have is the cost.  I felt that the food was good, but not worth the cost.  I would go again though because it is local, close by, and pretty decent.",Sd9FKiHoAoG1d700D1GMFA,1,1,3,k-xfkruO0coRCxnV7sGHPg

Finally we decided to go in for dinner on a Wednesday night. It was actually pretty steady in there, lots of other were families eating as well. It's a perfect sized restaurant-not too big and not too small. It's great because you can also sit outside and eat, there's a family room and a nice bar area. Overall the setting was very intimate and romantic. If you are a wine person I would suggest going here, seems like they had lots of different wines to choose from. It was a water and Sprite night for us. They do provide you with warm bread, oil and vinegar. 

Babe ordered the Caesar Salad, and it was a good portion but pointed out that there were only two Grape tomatoes in it. She also ordered the Baked Ziti which looked really good. (we noticed the couple next to us both ordered it) I got the Chicken Parmesan which comes with a side pasta. I really thought it was a small serving but ha, couldn't even finish it. The prices were not bad, we'll usually spend 40-50 dollars on a good night and we loved it here. Kelly was very nice but damn was she busy that night! She definitely was doing 3-4 different jobs, and it seemed like she was waiting on every table.

2349924,2013-08-21,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Went there because I had bought a Groupon for it. Went for dinner on a Saturday night, was told there was a 15-20 minute wait when we arrived, even though there were 4-5 tables open at the time. We sat at the bar and waited and kept asking each other why was there a wait when 4-5 tables were open? 
When it came time to seat us, the hostess took us to one of the tables near then bar that had been open the entire time. Found it very irritating that they made us sit at the bar and wait for 20 minutes only to be seated at a table that had been open the entire time.
Our waiter was friendly enough, but had to ask what the specials were, he didnt even mention them even though they were all listed on a huge chalk board on the wall. He raved about the 8oz. filet special, so we both ordered it , and asked for medium well. When the entree's arrived mine was more medium rare, but was ok, wasnt going to send it back for that, but my girlfriends was blood red raw. We told the waiter that it was not medium well, but raw. He agreed that it was not done, and took it back to the kitchen. He came back a few minutes later and said ""if you think it looked raw out here, you should have seen it under the light in the kitchen, it was really raw"". 
All they did was take it off of our bill, didnt offer to bring out another one, or even offer her anything else to eat, so we left with her having no dinner.
Since they took her entree of the bill, I didnt need to use the Groupon.  The experiance was so bad I doubt we will go back to even use it. Just going to write it off as a bad dining experiance and move on.
I'm still wondering how they could serve a filet without noticing that it was raw, and it was one the highly rated specials that night.",UKnQt9GX2dsiH7u5PfAtpQ,0,0,2,mdiAo1gQAMg0RyyipxHdWQ

The first two times they were busy so I do try to be understanding. This time we went only for what we were hoping to be a quick meal. It was 3:30 in the afternoon and we were the only people in the restaurant. When we walked in there was no one to greet us which is understandable due to it being so slow and the waiter quickly sat us once we were noticed and they did ask for our drink order quick but that's where good service ends. We were sat in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and our entire meal we could hear people in the kitchen using profanity every other word our entire meal which my 10 year old daughter could clearly hear. There were also another three people standing at the counter so deep in conversation that it took over 15 minutes to get two waters and a glass of wine. The food is good but most of the menu is overpriced which I could justify if the service was adequate.. It's a very cute place and could be great if only they got new wait staff or maybe trained the current staff.,3iuSf_D5hMX7O1tv32puFw,0,0,1,A7GbCeo5SObfT_wUS1eo7Q

We went in the fall so we chose to sit outside, which ended up being a really nice option. The food was yummy and our waiter was nice. They gave us a cute little dessert when we told them we were celebrating our anniversary. I wish I had pictures but I've since switched phones. 

We were almost going to go to an outrageously priced restaurant for our anniversary but last minute decided to go here for 1) the location is closer to our house than the fine dining options on the strip and  2) we didn't need a reservation.

Bad movie reference, but I was definitely ""whelmed"" by my Mezzo Bistro dining experience. I went last Friday, and surprisingly there was no wait. We were seated immediately, and the waiter came along and told us about the specials. I did not get a chance to sample the bread, but the other girls ate every bit. I ordered the caprese salad appetizer and Pork Tenderloin with mashed potatoes instead of pasta. 

The tomatoes in the caprese salad were anything but fresh. I ate around them, and enjoyed the cheese and basil. I did try the portobello mushroom appetizer as well, which was good if you're into mushrooms.

The pork tenderloin was awesome. Very moist and full of flavor. The only thing I didn't like was the portion. It was very tiny and costed about $19.

The service was really good. The space was a little crammed but there weren't many people there, so it wasn't too big of an issue. If you can get the Groupon, then go. If not, there are plenty of other places to eat with better food/prices.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,2,2,3,Tm4L3D2AM-7xT2vBDx1uxg

The place seemed nice enough, so I walked in and waited 10 minutes to be greeted at the host(ess) stand.  I seriously considered making a reservation over the phone just to see if someone would walk towards the front of the place.

When the waitress arrived out of breath, she seated me near the back next to the kitchen to wait again. 5 minutes later, I ordered a glass of wine.  She runs over and gets it from the bar and dumps it in my glass.  And I do mean dump... like it went up the side of my glass and over spilling on the table.  She didn't notice because she wasn't looking then ran off to the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, she took my order.  Twenty minutes later bread with a side of oil and vinegar came out.  Thirty minutes later, my caprese salad came out.  How on earth it takes 50 minutes to make a caprese salad I will never know. 25 minutes later, my soup came out.  I'm pretty sure this was pre-made and ladled into my bowl with again makes me wonder how on earth it took so long.

After I finished the soup, I honestly wasn't full, but didn't want to wait 20-40 minutes for something that was actually cooked.

I will give them an a star for the food being edible and an additional for having a decent cab franc by the glass.

Minus a star for a careless customer service.  Minus a star for an insane wait times.  Minus a star for a stained white table cloth (eww).

It is a truly deep regret of mine, as I tended to judge this proverbial book by its cover and never really thought a top quality, higher end bistro would be located near Craig & Rancho. If you know the area, there is a reason why the intersection lacks a Macaroni Grill, Chilis, or even a Chipotle. It's a rather run down part of town, with a laundromat, KFC, and tattoo parlor nearby. Mezzo Bistro is truly a diamond in the rough, transporting its guests to a home on the Italian countryside, where sauces are homemade, and even some pastas are made fresh onsite.

I purchased a groupon deal for lunch and took my 12 year old daughter there. Despite being midweek in Summer, the place had a surprising number of guests considering that they had just opened a few minutes prior. 

Our server ""Camille B"" was very attentive and our glasses never became empty. She was engaging and knowledgeable of the menu. I only wish the proprietor Sean Elefante was there so I could inform him of the pleasant experience that we had.

My spouse and I went there for lunch yesterday and I loved the decor and our food was outstanding; however, the SERVICE was NOT up to par.  There was only one waitress working; however, it was not very busy.  She never refilled our drinks or got my second glass of wine or never even asked us if we wanted dessert.  She took forever to bring us the check too.  If it were busy and she were more personable, then maybe I'd cut her some slack, but she wasn't even apologetic.  With that being said, we'll give it another try because the food was great but hopefully the service will be better.",0TofbTGG_4fsM6IWuhY6yA,0,0,4,_fc84GvtvRAd_yUv06GmFQ

I ordered probably the most basic Italian dish, but the hardest one to get right! Spaghetti and meatballs, and OMG were they bland! Besides being bland, they lacked moisture and were a bit to hard for my taste! I love to taste the cheese in my meatballs, the bread crumbs , and the parsley! Idk what they do or don't add to theirs, but they were so plain! I would not order that again! 

As far as the Italian wedding soup, it should be called chicken noodle soup, because that's all it was, we legit got two tiny meat balls!!! I've never known it to have shredded chicken, weird! That wasn't horrible  flavor wise, but the broth was kind of thick, the meatballs must of been boiled then sautéed cause they had a crust! Once again meatballs should be tender, and a boil for them in a soup like that is all that's needed! Lastly the noddles were big, we all know how small of a pasta this soup is traditionally served with!

 My boyfriend liked the lasagna though, but he doesn't know authentic Italian like me! Jersey east coast girl all the way, you have got to do better! Sorry but I do not plan on returning, with how the food tasted tonight!",j2rFqYXfK8dN-CxULh6aUg,1,0,2,uiC060TJAPxmlIITPv3ncA

The capers didn't go with the dish and I usually love capers. The beau got chicken parm. The portions are definitely like family style or at least sharable. It was huge for the price.

We did get tiramisu for dessert. The beau liked it but I wasn't much of a fan either. It didn't taste as good as I would have hoped. It kind of tasted like it was bought at A grocery store.

To find a private restaurant in this area of town is nearly impossible. We took a chance and bought a ""mystery date dinner"" on groupon and received a prefixed dinner to Mezzo Bistro. I had my doubts because of location, but the restaurant is fabulous.

We made reservations the day of, had no issue getting in on a Saturday night. The other walk in's were sitted right away as well so despite being busy, still no waiting that I saw.

We were sitting by Sean, the owner, who was pleasant. The decor is something more like a restaurant you'd see in Boca Park or Town Square. Dim lighting, romantic decor and comfortable sitting. Very Italian/wine/grape feel to it. There were all sort of clientele; some in jeans and sweaters, some in dresses and sports jackets. Either way, it's a comfortable and welcoming restaurant.

The service was perfect. Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. The staff was on spot, drinks never got low, plates removed in perfect timing and everyone was very nice.

The food.... Oh please! The appetizers were so good we ate every bite. The entrees were delicious. The one thing that I can say is that everything on the menu is traditional and the entrees that you see at other Italian restaurants. Mezzo Bistro takes traditional dishes and prepares them in the traditional way and does them exceptionally well. We had a caprese salad, chicken Parmesan, the veal special (can't remember the name) and the tiramisu.

Good flavor marinara sauce (which is essential), great tasting meats (we had chicken and veal entrees) and delicious desserts. A number of items are hand made and the detail shows. I asked if we could buy the vinegar glaze by the bottle because it's that good. And the tiramisu I will be dreaming about.

Like I mentioned, we had a groupon so we had a discount, but the listed prices average about $20-25 for entrees. 

It's the little details of a privately owned restaurant that makes it exceptional. We both took home part of our entrees from our dinner there last night. It was too good to pass up. When I opened up the bag, there was a nice note signed by the chef with a cork attached to it as a thank you.

Mezzo Bistro will be our go-to date night place for romantic dinners. It will be the place we take guest from out of town that want to get off the strip. Well done Mezzo... Takes a lot to get a 5-star rating, but it's well deserved and really an amazing experience.",7308lEhM1lrH2cYCOk3SJA,2,0,5,drFmUjuqwIG4tgZ9cQuV3w

Went there with family a little after they opened on my birthday and we were sat by a waiter, who then asked for our drink order. I asked for a high chair and the waiter threw a temper tantrum and a fit. He exclaimed to another employee that he wasn't even on the clock yet and now he's running around to help us.

I contacted the owner via email and relayed my frustration. That it was just terrible service of the waiter, if anything let him know that he could be heard loud and clear and something like that should be addressed out of site of my family and my kids.

The place was very cozy and nicely decorated. The waiter that seated us was very cordial. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. There was no children's menu but she suggested smaller options of pasta dishes for my picky 2 yr old and put in his order right away. The portion was very generous and tasted awesome. My son loved it and he doesn't like much.

My choice was the chicken parmesan and my daughter ordered the lasagne. The food was fresh/hot and very visually appealing. Our portions were huge and delicious! Some of the best ""American Italian"" food I've ever had. The bread that accompanied our meals was delicious as well and out glasses were never empty. 

If I had to pick anything wrong it would be the fact that the oil and vinegar for the bread came in a small dish instead of on a plate which made it difficult to get to the vinegar with out saturating your bread with oil. Simple solution.... ask for it on a plate ;-)

There just happened to be some Amy-Winehouse-Wannabe singing that night, and of course we got seated right next to her and her gigantic amplifier. The place was packed and loud as hell.

The Good:
I gotta give them props for plating and presentation, definitely gives you the upscale vibe. Their décor is beautiful, a little cluttered, but clearly a lot of time and detail went into decorating the place. The owner/manger was highly involved and was walking around over-seeing everything.

The Bad:
We could not get our drinks refilled and our waiter was practically non-existent, he seemed too young and inexperienced. Our drinks were filled ONCE and it wasn't until we were all pretty much about done eating and asked if we could get water at least. It was extremely irritating. I'm a vegetarian and I specifically asked for no bacon on top of my pasta but of course there was bacon all over it. A different waiter brought our food and I brought it to his attention and he kindly took it back, I guess to get me a new plate of pasta. I got my food by the time the rest of my table was almost done eating. The food is outrageously expensive for food that's not knock your socks off good. Our asparagus was undercooked and hard to eat, and I remember the price for it was ridiculous. 

The Ugly:
Ok. I understand wanting to achieve a romantic, upscale, classy look for your restaurant. And I understand what ""romantically-dimmed lights"" are. This is not it. When it's so dark you can't even see your significant others face who is sitting right in front of you, it kind of takes the ""romance"" out of everything. I couldn't even see the food on my plate, it was actually really fucking annoying. I'm getting mad again just thinking about how dark it was in there. Because of the singer they had performing there, and the fact that we were sitting right next to her amplifier, it was so god damn loud we all had to practically scream at each other. So conversing did not happen. 

All in all, not a fun experience and it was supposed to be a birthday dinner. I would maybe try this place early on a weekday when there is enough sunlight to see my own hand in front of me, and when they are not so packed. Food wasn't bad at all, just the environment and staff.",IBfXie3My8uh8aYmynC3Sw,0,0,2,s3qjAQMDM-x_j_RIl_D2Hg

I will say that I've had some real hits and misses off of their menu.  The real hidden gems are their specials.  I've had some real amazing stuff off of that menu.  Make sure you either ask your waiter/waitress or check the chalkboard at the back of the restaurant.

So, my reason for 3 stars instead of 4 is primarily due to their slow service.  EVERY time I come to this place, my food takes a small eternity.   Not overly full, seems appropriately staffed...why is my food taking this long!?!

Since my restaurant experience is limited to Diner Dash.  I'd say upgrade your stove.

Anyone who has had a caprese salad knows you get heirloom tomatoes, soft mozzarella, basil, and balsamic vinegar. I've had buffalo mozzarella many times and this was not it. The mozzarella was something Walmart sales. The tomatoes where standard tomatoes. It was all cut so thick that i had to use a knife. Flavor was terrible. Then I found bell peppers on my plate.

The servers were nice but very slow at bringing out everything. Even the oil we asked for for our bread. My brother's order was supposed to have tiger shrimp which they forgot completely and brought out later on the side like they were doing him some favor. For a dish that was over $24 that's a little ridiculous. He said most of his mussels didn't even have meat in them either. My ravioli vodka never again just gross. The chicken piccata my brother's girlfriend she enjoyed. My grandma had the Veal which was very tender. So two out of the four entrees were good. We ordered Trimisu and chocolate mouse cake for dessert. The Trimisu was very light and not soggy had a nice flavor. The chocolate mouse cake though we never got to try because they brought out a red velvet cake that looked like a flat piece of cake I baked at home with some ice cream on top. Not what we wanted at all. It was dry and definitely not a good ending to our meal. I really wish I didn't have this yelp coupon to use that I already paid for because I would much rather take my business else where.

Bread with oil and balsamic was OK.  Wedge salad with blue cheese. It was drizzled with balsamic , 2 sprinkles of crumbled bacon.  It was good.  Grilled asparagus  drizzled with more balsamic was barely warm.  Pasta fagioli was a bowl of beans with about 2 tablespoons of tomatoey broth and NO PASTA in it and it was highly spiced.

3860257,2017-05-14,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Food is very good, very cute spot. I am only giving a 2 star rating for two reasons:

My husband ordered the steak frittes which says comes with either garlic fries, house salad or some other type of salad. I forgot. He picked the house salad for his side. They bring his salad in a large bowl and he loves it. Next, our entrees came out. His steak frittes come and it has a small side house salad on the plate so they misunderstood us and charged us a whole house salad when we just wanted it as one of the sides that we thought just came with it.

The second reason is that we had a $10 restaurant.com voucher that specifically says no dates excluded. When the bill came, my husband told the server we had the voucher before the server cut him off and said ""We don't accept those today."" We don't like complaining or drama and our infant has kicked our butts today so we had no energy to show him the terms of the voucher. 

So, we spent more money than we intended to. The food is good though, no complaints there. The service is good as well, we just weren't too happy with those two things. One of my biggest pet peeves with businesses is when they act like you offended their religion when you present a coupon, Groupon, or a voucher of some type and come up with some reason to not honor it (not stated in the voucher disclosure). Like, come on, you obviously signed your business up for it. If you don't like losing money with coupons, don't issue them. It's not like I designed it and created it myself. It was only a measly $10, not a free meal for ten. As much as I liked the food, it is all about first impressions and I don't see myself going back. Plus I just didn't like how the server didn't even let my husband finish his sentence before cutting him off with ""we don't accept those today.""

I can say the staff has gotten nicer and the food has gotten worse.  My husband likes pepper on his salad the our waiter told us the chef refuses to have salt and pepper for the table.  Sometimes the wait staff will offer fresh ground pepper and others act annoyed (they use to ALL act annoyed).

Their wine list is pretty good but in my opinion restaurants also need good service and food.

Food is mediocre.  Their soup and salads are the best thing on the menu.  I've also ordered chicken, fish, pasta and pizza and it's just okay.

We brought guests for the chefs special ""surprise me"" (sorry forgot the name) and it was okay.  We had 1 vegetarian in the group and we all wished we all had requested the vegetarian option.  Funny thing is they don't really offer much meatless options on the menu but this night the chef must of came out of his box to surprised us.

The server was a sweetheart and even though she was covering the inside tables as well, was on top of checking on us and was very friendly. 

    I ordered the blackened salmon (win) served with garlic mashed taters (win squared) and grilled asparagus (bonus). The crust on the salmon was blackened perfectly and the interior was pink and moist. I had to try not to do a happy dance in my chair...I may have bounced a little.

    My bf ordered the chicken parmesan, took a bite and proclaimed it one of the best he has ever had. I make chicken parm at home and was decidedly huffy when I tried it since clearly I would hope my homemade would top this... Nope, theirs is better and my pride dissolved in one bite.

It was 6:30pm on a Monday night for a party of five.  The street appeal is awesome and even when you walk in the place is warm and inviting.  That is where the positive remarks end.  I walk in first to find a server with his back to me, lighting candles at the hostess stand.  About a minute goes by before he turns his head slightly and says, ""it'll be a moment"".  Okay we say. About a minute later, we are seated at a table just a couple of feet away. And we wait.  Finally we are approached and asked what drinks we would like. Three ice teas, a diet and a root beer.  And we wait.  And wait. So finally our drinks come and they are handed out right over my shoulder, to everyone.  If I was at a bar paying $10 a plate, that's no biggie,BUT I wasn't.  He leaves and we wait some more. One sip of my ice tea and I realize it's not even fresh brewed.  Sigh.  So about twenty minutes go by and I watch three different servers flutter around but none come by to us.  I finally stop one as he walks by us to great a couple at the door.  I ask for  some service and he says he's new and will find someone.  Less than a minute later, someone is standing in front of us with a pen poised and irritated.  So I tell him that It's our first time there, it's my birthday and so far I'm not impressed at all.  Boxed tea, no bread (it's an Italian restaurant for God sake!) and no true welcome and introduction to the place.  I'm told there's no manager on duty before I even ask for one.  So I ask him directly, ""Is this what I can expect if we choose to stay and eat here?"".  His reply is, ""We are busy and short-staffed.  If you want to leave you can.""  Seriously?  So we did.

The service wes very good and all of the staff behind the bar seemed very attentive and was a pleasure to deal with.
When we left Mezzo, the establishment was about 75% full and is usually a good indication of both quality of food and good service.
We sampled both the beet salad and calamari appetizers.  Both were very good and I would recommend and order them again. The house Cabarnet was fairly good and only $3/per glass.  Good value and was a decent quality.

Our bill was $48 for two, not including the tip. We attemped to use the Groupon/AmazonLocal coupon that we purchaed for $12 and the staff at the resturant told us that they would not honor it because we ordered from the Happy Hour menu.  The Happy Hour menu did not mention this fact and the coupon/voucher that we purchaed did not mention this on their disclosues and termf of use.

The service is good, but the food - oh, the specials are always good. One of the owners talked me into a squash ravioli I still dream about.

The pizzas are great, and I am a sucker for the gorgonzola filet.

4103633,2014-09-22,3,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I have been there on two separate occasions, and both times were, well.....meh. 

The atmosphere is certainly top notch. We had the little private room for my buddy's birthday, and we had a large table on the second occasion, both were comfy, and we had about 10 people both times. The entire restaurant is set-up very tight for seating, which is actually nice for a small place, it is almost homey, that part I like.

The staff is good. The waiter we had the first time seemed like he was certainly new at his job, when someone asked the specials he fumbled around a bit, but he was quick on his toes and provided good service. I wish I could remember the waiter we had in the evening, he was easily one of the best waiters I have ever had. He knew everything there, very knowledgeable about wines (it IS a wine bar) and the menu, very enthusiastic. 

The food is ok, could step it up a bit for the price. My wife and I both had specials of the evening. I had Chilean sea bass, which just tasted like fish, nothing outstanding. My wife had prime rib that was pretty good. My prior visit I had meat lasagna, which tasted good, but was basically a bowl of melted cheese, while my wife had chicken piccata, which was pretty good. 

The coffee was not good. This may be nit-picky, but I really put a big emphasis on good coffee, and there's was not good coffee. And it wasn't hot. Coffee is one of those things that I like to order after my meal, and really seals the deal for me as to the quality of the establishment.

My biggest beef with this place was when we were basically handed our hat when trying to order desert. The waiter told us his manager wanted to box up our desserts upon ordering and send us on our way because of a wedding party that was coming in. I told them that we would certainly NOT pay for desserts in a box, when we could just go down the street and grab something for a quarter of the price. The waiter clearly felt like a jerk, he said straight up that was not right, he was just doing his job. Then the manager came over and apologized, gave us a little discount, handed us some coupons, and sent us on our way. We discovered in the parking lot that the coupons all expire within a couple of weeks, too. Our check was over $300, and we were hustled out the door.

This was our third time here and finally had to write about it. 

The place is very popular! It is small so reservations are a must.  Yes there is a wait sometimes, but it is worth it.  The waiters are busy but always very courteous.  There is a lot of team work going on as several members tend to your table.   The food is excellent!  Very authentic and made from scratch.  We tried the hot antipasto and WOW is was delicious.  The pasta dishes are huge portions and they don't skimp on the sauce.  Even thought there is a bit of a wait for the food ( we just enjoy an extra glass of wine) the food arrives hot.   We also had Tiramisu for dessert, which is made fresh daily and you can taste the difference. 

The ambiance is very intimate.  Tables and booths well placed and great for family gatherings or a romantic evening.  Order your mean kick back enjoy a drink and listen to the music while they prepare a wonderful and authentic Italian meal.

We are fans of live music.  We will go out of our way to support any establishment that features live music.  This is Vegas and yet most places are not able to support what is an important part of the the Vegas culture.  Last night we enjoyed the Hartline Trio.  The singer was excellent and just right for the room.  We have also enjoyed other featured bands and vocalist that add to the ambiance of the room.  

We will continue to visit this establishment and recommend it highly.",ACrPFxA8DkXFPgcs6nsAgQ,5,0,5,TPUdgxDj2zPr5WiWYtMvQQ

4484712,2012-11-27,3,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Armed with a Groupon, we headed to Mezzo - to a neighborhood we've never been to - to celebrate our anniversary.  I was impressed with the decor: trendy, but not too, nice bar (except for the ubiquitous TV, but only one), nice lighting, tablecloths covered with paper in true bistro style.

We had truly great service; the music ( Frank, Dean, Tony - apparently a legal requirement at all Italian restaurants in Vegas -  with some newer stuff for variety) was a bit too loud, so it was turned down immediately at my request.  I was a bit chilly, so the heat was instantly raised.  Our drink orders were taken right away, and the food orders when we were ready.

We shared a dinner salad, consisting of the usual suspects, with the addition of chickpeas and a dollop of ricotta for interest.  It would have been appreciated if the kitchen had separated it for us before it was served.  For entrees, my husband ordered his new favorite - chicken piccata - and was pleased with it.  I decided to go with the Tuscan Tenderloin, pork cooked in Chianti, served with apples in Prosecco, and asparagus.  The apples and asparagus were fabulous, as was the sauce for the pork, but the texture of the meat wasn't blowing me away.  I would have kept it, but when the waiter asked how our food was, I must have made a little face.  What happened next is the hallmark of a very good restaurant:  the owner came out, took the pork away and checked it in the kitchen where the light was better.  Long story short, he told me that I still wouldn't be happy with it if I had him make me a new one, and that I should choose something else.  Hubby's chicken looked very good, so I went with that.  But I kept the penne that had come with my pork, because it was perfectly al dente and sauced just right, so I had them hold the angel hair.  But I got my asparagus back, and it was sooo good!  The chicken had fresh capers, which really bump up chicken piccata several notches, and this one was a winner.

We never order dessert, but since we were celebrating a whole decade of marital bliss, we decided to break the rules.  (And this after pigging out on the 30-day cruise we'd just come back from!)  Hubby wanted the cannoli, but I've never been a fan of them, so I convinced him to go with the cheesecake.  But the wonderful owner, Sean, brought him a sample of their cannoli, and man, if they all tasted like that one, I'd be eating them for breakfast:  big chocolate chips, chocolate sauce, so decadent my mouth is watering just writing this.  Ah, but the cheesecake was fabulous, too, a small round individual cake covered with fresh strawberries.  Rich and delicious, and all mine!  I could have scarfed down the whole thing, but my superego kicked in, and I managed to have it last for three nights. 

It's wonderful when a restaurant owner cares enough to make sure that you're satisfied with all aspects of the restaurant experience, even if you're there with a Groupon, and that makes all the difference.  It was great to leave with that feel-good feeling that makes you want to go back.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,5,4,e11nsMh3iMWsvP5dMea9fA

I sat with my back to the door and was literally hit with every member of the staff that was walking in and out of the hand off plane from the kitchen to the dining room. I had a perfect view of all the line cooks working and chewing food like they were cows eating the best piece of grass they'd ever tasted. Literally chewing with their mouths wide open, WHILE cooking?!?!? Our server looked at us as though we were a bunch of young punk kids because we didn't order wine, he turned up his nose. Anyway we ordered our food, my bread plate had last nights left overs crusted on it still. While waited for our food, the ""nice"" gentleman who had greeted us began yelling at the waiters and food runners that the ""servers are too slow and that the guests who were seated at the table needed to be rushed or and gone already because he needed to seat a party of six!"" Wait, you are really expecting the server to tell his PAYING guests to kick rocks because another party needs to be sat??? I was blown away. Our food came out, very hot, my boyfriend loved his halibut. I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo. It was tasty but for the same price I'd rather drive 45 minutes out of my way and go to Bootleggers where I am always treated well and never have to see the staff running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

4693660,2009-05-08,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"We first dined at this small southern Italian restaurant in December.  We started off with a family sized serving of pasta fagioli which was good, but a bit tame to suit my taste buds.  Our entrees were eggplant parmesan, a family recipe of the chef, prepared without breading that we found to be both ample and delicious.  I used a $25 certificate purchased at a discount from a local radio station.

12/08 The owner/chef once owned the highly regarded, now defunct, Marc's Italian Steakhouse, but sold it a few years back and opened the slightly larger Mezzo.  We ordered pasta faglioli - family style, but were informed the kitchen was out of it this evening, so we settled on minestrone listed as a special.  It was reasonably good, but the portion size was exceptionally small and a total rip off at $7 per bowl.  Ms. Westie's entrée was a very large portion of eggplant parmesan, a family recipe, prepared without any breading. I chose the spinach lasagna with a tomato vodka sauce which was equally bountiful and delicious.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,1,0,3,4_vSNS7npqR2GvxK4yfruw

4721596,2014-06-22,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Mezzo is a great little restaurant in a neighborhood sorely in need of more places like it!

I've been to Mezzo a few times now, and the food has been good each time. Between my boyfriend and I, we've had a variety of appetizers, steaks, chicken, and pastas. The house salad is very nice as well (love the FRESH strawberry they include with it!). There's always a good number of attractive specials listed on the chalk board as well.

Also, if you love wine - especially wines that you don't find on everyone else's lists - Mezzo will be a pleasant surprise for you. They have the BEST Malbec, Durugutti, on their list by the glass. They've got several more excellent by the glass choices. And the wine prices are reasonable (I just HATE paying a restaurant 50% more than average for the exact same glass of wine. Take Flemings for example: $15 for the same glass of cab that you get up the street at Grimaldi's for $10. Geeze!).

The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is clean, and they do have a patio for the days that are nice enough to dine al fresco. Overall, Mezzo is a good experience at a fair price...and I consider myself a food and wine snob. :)

I do have to point out one thing: The service can be spotty. The reviewer who talks about waiting a while to be greeted is right. That happened to us the first time we dined...then a party who arrived after us WITHOUT the reservation we had was seated first! Table service has been generally adequate, though. The service issue isn't bad enough for me to boycott the place, and the only reason I even mention it is in hopes that the owner/general manager will read this review and seriously take it to heart. 

Anyway, give Mezzo a try. It's a great little neighborhood place, certainly worth a drive if you don't live in the Northwest/Summerlin region.",sOPmVW0bmbb8vwEH5C7FzA,1,1,5,CfIj-fmL040haXjdYw9duA

4835440,2014-07-10,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Went to this place after buying their groupon.

Instead of ordering a entree, I decided to switch it up and order just appetizers. I got the calamari, the blackened salmon, ""The Works"" or what was a blue cheese wedge salad, and a margherita pizza. Everything tasted mostly average if not below average, something that you get out of a chain restaurant place like a Chili's or Applebee's. The wedge salad was drowning in dressing and a lot of the lettuce ended up being soggy, on top of there not being a lot of bacon or bluecheese chunks. The pizza's crust was too thick, and with big thick slices of tomatoes on it. The menu described it with only having marinara sauce, cheese, and basil, the ingredients I mostly see associated with a margherita. While I did pick off the tomatoes, the pizza ended up being partly soggy in some places and less appetizing. The blackened salmon was just blackened in looks, and lacking in flavor, but at least it wasn't dried out or overcooked.  They were nice enough to trade out the spaghetti squash with sauteed spinach, but the spinach was cooked with too much oil and was greasy. Even though it was a appetizer, for the price, it was a very small piece of salmon. The calamari was probably the best thing I ate. It was seasoned well,  not overly cooked, and the marinara sauce was flavorful and chunky with tomatoes.

The service during my meal was good, my drink was always filled.

Once I was done, I asked for the bill. Like I said earlier, I had a groupon, and with tax I still owed a couple of bucks and some change. I paid with a 20 dollar bill.  I got the right dollar amount back, but the change portion didn't come with it. Maybe the waitress forgot, maybe it was one of those shady restaurants that ""never has change"" and doesn't round up, or maybe she stole it. I didn't care enough to find out so I just left.

Overall, with the below average food and missing change at the end, I don't think I will be coming back. Without the groupon, the food would have been a rip-off in terms of price, portion, and quality. I'm sure there are better Italian spots in town with better quality food, and who can also give back the right change.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,1,0,1,8GNrv5OuPIO91eJ7znF-lg
4845526,2011-05-02,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I last went to Mezzo about two years ago - I happen to live on the opposite side of town so I haven't been back in the neighborhood for dinner in a while.

So on to the food - I had the Filletto Gorgonzola and my girlfriend had the Double Thick Bone-in Chop.  I got the 5 ounce fillet mignon because I wasn't super hungry, but I felt $24 was a bit high for a steak that size.  It came with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes as well as a gorgonzola sauce - everything was delicious and the steak was nice and tender, although I seem to remember the menu mentioned ""crispy prosciutto"" being a part of the entrée but there was no sign of it on my plate.

My girlfriend's pork chop was also very tasty and the tenderest pork chop I've ever had.  It had a delicious peppery (as in hot/sweet peppers, not black pepper) sauce.  The only downside for her was that she asked for no mushrooms and got them on the plate anyway.

The food was delicious, my only complaint being that there was a bit of a wait between ordering and getting our food and finishing and getting our check.  I didn't really mind though because all the staff was hustling and everyone was helping every table that needed anything and we always had bread. I hope they're being paid well - I've read some of the less than stellar reviews for this place and feel like they must have gone to a different restaurant.  Also our waiter comped our sodas for the wait without us ever complaining which I felt was nicely done.

Third, wine and food pairing specials were not explained and our waitress was unaware of the Captain List wine special for that day. 

Overall, it was very disorganized and underwhelming. Hopefully, improvements can be made for the next wine tasting in the future. We ordered dinner too and the food was amazing as always but service was slow and we had to ask for bread maybe five times before we got it and we did receive it until way after we ate our main dishes.

I was in love with the calamari, which was lightly breaded with pieces of pepperonici. My white wine clams with linguini was paired nicely with the La Crema Chardonnay. We will definitely be back!!

5020274,2013-09-22,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Good food, poor service. We like to use groupon when trying places for the first time, so we purchased the $47 pre-fixe dinner for a value of up to $96 and includes any two appetizers up to $14 each, two glasses of wine up to $12 each, and two entrees totaling $44, with anything additional settled with the bill. Would've been a great deal had we not decided to order a bowl of soup in addition to our meal. Apparently soup is considered an appetizer; on the menu, however, the soup and the appetizers were listed separately. Good to know now, but not happy to find out after receiving bill. Slightly deceptive to consider a $7 bowl of soup (and cheapest item on the menu) as one of the two appetizers without making mention of it until time to pay. 

Besides the coupon, the service was extremely slow and the waiter barely stopped by the table other than to drop food off, let alone check on the quality or if we needed anything. We're not high-maintenance diners, but a little more courtesy and interaction would've been appreciated. Also, the tables they seat couples at are tiny (and we're not exactly big), which makes for an uncomfortable dining experience if you have anything besides a couple of plates down (good luck if you decide to have wine and bread).

Total bill including groupon was $75. We drove from Henderson after hearing good things and really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, we should've just saved the gas and found a comparable meal for the same price closer to home. Save your money for another restaurant or skip the shoddy service and order your food to go (meatballs and eggplant parm were great).",TP-h_yMlZjqnFQ9RKRAdig,2,1,2,FOZb5bUWTuZMvyLnfljdPQ

5051035,2015-09-22,5,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I wanted to try something differen and this has been on my bookmark for a long while so I came for lunch with my mom and mother in law.

They have a scaled down lunch menu until 4pm (according to their site). I ended up getting their chicken parmesan which was pretty solid! Crisp, not greasy and the sauce on it was homemade and had a nice balance. It was one of the better parms I've had in town. My mom enjoyed her chicken piccata thoroughly and I snuck in a bite and thought it was a solid choice too. My MIL got a sausage and peppers sandwich and really loved it because of their tomato sauce. It comes with a daily side which was a pasta salad she didn't quite like, but you can request for other sides too. 

My mom tends to over order so we got too many desserts. Creme brulee is bruleed tableside which was nice since you can customize how charred you like your sugar. Pizza fritta (or we call in zeppolis) was actually pretty good. If you like fried dough like beignets you might be into these too.  My mom took a cannoli home to my stepdad. 

Our server was one of the bartenders and he was super friendly and attentive. Great service. 

Based on our positive lunch experience, the MIL and I came back with my husband for dinner the following week. 

She got the chicken parmesan based on my positive review on it and she enjoyed it as well. The husband and I split the chicken marsala which was pretty yummy with a perfect sauce and a snapper special from the chaulkboard. Unfortunately, that snapper was way overcooked and had a pretty strong fishy taste to it. We rarely send anything back to the kitchen, but this was not something either of us felt comfortable eating. Maybe not the spot I'm gonna order a fish again, but all the other dishes have been cooked perfectly with juicy chicken. 

This time service was not as attentive and basic. The plus is that he took the fish back, took it off our bill without any issue, but we weren't checked on. The hubby ate off his moms chicken parm and the marsala and we almost finished the dishes off before we were checked on to even tell him about the fish and request some drink refills. 

We ended up getting the pizza fritta dessert again and a tiramisu. I haven't had a good tiramisu in a while and that was light with just enough coffee. 

Overall, solid place for some Italian in the northwest. Definitely would order the dishes we had over and over again (minus the fish). Check for groupons as well, I see them pop up fairly often.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,2,4,2OLYho75lFkT80Lwo8Amuw

The service has gotten so much better as well. (I haven't seen a waiter we used to get all of the time). So hopefully, he's gone. He was so bad, we would hesitate coming here. Every other waiter we've had has been wonderful. 

My favorite dish recommendations:

Appetizers--
Portebello Mushroom 
Meatball Special - their meatballs are delectable

Pizzas--
The Mezzo is amazing
The Bianca
Parma (my favorite)

Pasta--
Meat Lasagna - I haven't found a better one in Vegas yet.
Spaghetti (add meatballs)
Gnocchi - this is one of their best dishes.

Also, they have specials that are usually REALLY good. If they hav Chilean Sea Bass, that's usually one of our favorites. 

They also have a good wine selection. Josh is one of my favorites that they carry. 

I really do love this place. Overall, as many times as we've been, the food has been very consistant. The owner is a really nice guy too. He really cares about his business, as he is there all of the time.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,21,21,5,gglitYFQAB1y5Goi3p8eEA

5123047,2015-03-12,2,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Been here twice and this place has very good food and a good ""Sunday sauce"" that accompanies most dishes.

Pros: 
-Generous portions of chicken parmigiana that are pounded out (as they should be) and includes a nice portion of pasta to go with it.

-Orienchetta (sp?) is very good, this place actually turned me onto the dish and I've had it both times now.

-Decent pricing and with that groupon that floats around, you get a really good deal.

-They are generous with the excellent sauce, not like some places that go cheap, each dish here is smothered in it.

Cons:

-Bread could be fresher, didn't have that fresh out of the oven taste or even a made yesterday taste.

-The pizza is so-so...they are very generous with the cheese which is nice but the dough tastes very similar to a digiorno rising crust frozen pizza dough.

- This last time we went we ordered 2 entrees and a pizza..after finishing our pizza we had to wait an extra 30 minutes for our other 2 entrees...the timing was way off...perhaps the waiter forgot to put in the full order so service was a miss tonight.

5147534,2017-09-14,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I originally went to Mezzo Bistro and Wine last year with a friend of mine. We would pass it and decided to go for dinner-we were sold on the ambience alone and decided to go back. 

The second time we went the restaurant had gained quite a bit of popularity since our last visit and not to mention we made a conscious decision to go on ""music bingo"" night and was some sort of excited. We knew we would be there for awhile and having dinner so we bought the ""Groupon"" and was looking forward to a good time. 

The staff: 
Upon our arrival and seating, we informed our waitress about the ""Groupon"" and my friend mentioned that she was on ""YELP"" and she wanted to redeem her free glass of wine for checking in on the site. Her face instantly changed and she stated ""you can't use more than one coupon"". I stated okay no problem, we'd prefer to use our ""Groupon"" anyway since we are eating dinner and had planned on ordering a glass of wine with it. Therefore, forfeit the YELP deal and just charge us for the wine. OMG, I must have asked for the world because her face immediately changed and she stated again we couldn't use both. At the point, I asked to talk to the manager because I thought she was being unreasonable. The owner/manager is so nice, I felt bad for having to go over her head but she wasn't being open. I really didn't think it was a big deal and neither did he because he completely agreed and instead gave us a handwritten card for a free bottle of wine for our next visit and allowed us to use our ""Groupon"". We ended up spending about $150.00 for dinner and wine that night and the ""Groupon"" only covered $50 bucks. To me it's a win, win for the restaurant and with word of mouth it appears it's becoming more and more popular. Clearly, that night the waitress didn't think of those key points. SMH

The food: 
Appetizer: The summer salad, with pears balsamic vinaigrette and walnuts. Entrée' was the Chilean Sea Bass  with artichoke hearts, atop Risotto in a white wine sauce which was fantastic.  Wasn't a fan of the tiramisu but I didn't complain, I was in Sea Bass heaven by that time. :)

Overall: 
I give this place all 5 stars and owner/manager really loves what he does and it shows. I really appreciate his willingness to ensure his customer's are happy and for the most part the food is always delicious. 5 stars!",tECqAaACQDUz-sDG_Eh3aQ,0,0,5,gQZLS83zG5Fk0J_PBmpGqg

For my appetizer I had the cheese and cracker platter. It was delicious. My girlfriend had fried zuccini which was very good.

For entrees I had the lasagna while my girlfriend had the ravioli. Both were delicious.

Our service was great. We were helped immediately, and our server was very attentive throughout.  My girlfriend and I are both young and know very little about wine.

5278305,2014-10-14,2,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"I LOVE Mezzo Bistro and Wine!! The ambiance at Mezzo is perfect - The restaurant is dimly lit, saturated in red, and decorated heavily with Italian accents. It feels intimate and sets the mood perfectly for a romantic date or night out. Mezzo is like this hidden local gem that you find in a totally unexpected place.

I'm not gonna lie, there was a stretch where my husband and I visited Mezzo once a month. My husband loves his Tuscan Tenderloin ($19) so much, he declared that it was his favorite meal ever. I myself prefer the Vegetable Lasagna ($15). It's loaded with squash, mushrooms, zucchini, and asparagus to name a few ingredients. More importantly, the Vegetable Lasagna is just dripping with cheese. Few Italian restaurants make a vegetarian lasagna (at least to my liking), so I have to get it while it's hot! I'd also highly recommend the Insalata Salad ($5). It's huge, fresh, and unique. 

As much as I'd like to give Mezzo 5 stars, I have to knock 'em down by one due to service. The service is inconsistent at Mezzo and your experience depends on which waiter you get. Joe is the best waiter at Mezzo - he's friendly, attentive, and has memorized our order since we're regulars. I've learned to ask for Joe when we come in, so word to the wise, make sure you do the same!

Mezzo makes it easy for me to stick to my belief in supporting businesses owned by locals. I've been about five times and it has always been good.  I've had some really GREAT service and some average service, but never bad service. I love that they are on Groupon.  In facrt, I think I may have a groupon sitting in my blackberry waiting to be used - the groupon, not the blackberry. The blackberry is happy to rest. 
I have had pasta, chicken, fish, and I think veal.  Gotta find that Groupon and get some veal. My favorite meal is the roastd veg dish. It is meant to be an appetizer, but it is huge and delicous, I like it as an entree.  Last time, I added a piece of salmon, which they did differently for me since I don't like blackened.  I'm adventurous at life, but not so much with food - just learning to eat with a little heat.  Anyway, they did a simple salmon, cooked well as I don't like it rare. Don't judge me, it's the restaurant you are interested in, not me.  Back to the veg - exquisite - asparagus, peppers, zucchini, and beautiful roasted tomatoes! Fantastic! 
Stop eating your entreee at about the half way point so you have room for dessert.  I love their coffee!
I would love to splurge on the chef's dinner.  The chef selects the menu.  it's a special deal.  Maybe for my birthday, which is coming if you are interested.

Wife didn't like her salad much but the rest of the food was fine. I had a pasta fagioli soup which was very tasty. wife had some kind of 3 cheese chicken croquette appetizer. My veal parm with penne was excellent...wife's eggplant parm was quite good. crowd is quite loud..music too loud also....prices very reasonable but that wine deal left me feeling...not quite right.",NcYAAsxBG0Ypxva-0UN7dA,0,0,3,lz92pXKe3CcD0oqmBaHgNw

My son is only 1 and he loved the soup. It was a perfect combination of beans and pasta. My daughter and I shared a salad caprese and the salmon mediterranean. The salad was fresh and the dressing flavorful. The salmon pasta was deliciously paired with a glass of 19 crimes.

We finished dinner with the creme brule for the table and a cheesecake to go. Both desserts were delightful. I enjoyed a glass of desert wine, a port 20, I believe. 

We truly appreciate the kind service and attentive staff. The food is always a crowd pleaser.

We love to eat and usually enjoy an occassional drink with dinner. Tonight we had a reisling with our meal, it was very good. Wine list here is huge and very good!

For an appetizer we had the sampler, it had shrimp, calamari, muscles, clams and fish in a wine and tomato sauce. With the warm sourdough bread to scoop up the broth, it was very good. 

I had the sweet sauage with homemade pasta, very good, mushrooms, garlic and spinach. Still loving it today! My husband had the chicken madera, also very rich sauce, mushrooms and two big pieces of chicken served with pasta. Two very good dishes.

It was a wine dinner and each wine was explained, I remember having a good experience but didn't remember the food. 

We went today for lunch because we were in the area and my friend had a coupon.  Upon arrival the place was empty, approximately 10 people total were in the restaurant.  We stood at the front waiting for someone to seat us there was no sign indicating to seat ourselves or wait.  During this time, we saw the bartender and looked over to him for some type of guidance or acknowledgement, none of which were forthright. After several minutes of standing there and not being greeted we decided to sit at the bar. 

When we arrived at the bar, the bartender greeted us and asked us for our drinks, I asked for a diet coke and a water, same order I give every restaurant, every time. I only received the diet coke.  My friend and I ordered the same item the chicken riggies, mine as it came with rigatoni, and hers with gluten free pasta.  After 25 minutes, yes 25 minutes when there were only 10 people in the entire restaurant, our food finally arrived, both with gluten free pasta.  Because I wasn't starving hungry I said I wanted what I had originally ordered and sent it back.  This time it only takes approximately 10 minutes, with just a sprinkle of the cheese on top and nuked as opposed to the heavily cheesed baked option my friend received.

After 1 bite I could tell this was box pasta.  The bartender asked how it was, I said terrible, I said I though the pasta was homemade, he said no only 2 pastas are homemade the gnocchi and orecchiette , crazy me expecting homemade pasta in an Italian restaurant!

I sent it back letting him know it was inedible.  The bartender asked ""should I take this off the bill?""  I responded it should've been taken off the bill when you came out with the wrong order and made me wait. 

No manager, no apologies, no offer for any way to make it up. I didn't read any of the reviews before coming her, if I would have I would have maybe rethought my original decision.",4cxEtNt0m_aVO9YiATwuiw,4,0,1,9QXzRD1Yad1zE40K1FzHYw

I'd give you a ZERO rating, but since that isn't possible, you'll earn a completely undeserved one star.  

10/30/2013, about 11:30 a.m.

My wife and I go in for lunch, order a Caesar salad and two entrees.  The salad comes out, and to be honest, it's pretty good.  

Then, my wife finds a PUSHPIN in her salad.  Are you f**king kidding me?  A PUSHPIN?  

She spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.)  We show this to her, and she quickly apologizes and goes back into the kitchen.  For a while.  My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act.  

The woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again.  No manager or chef came out to check on us either.  So we left.  BTW:  Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again.

I don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins?  You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem?  No?  

I will say that this wasn't our first time there.  In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in.  And all the other times, I left happy with my meals.  But never again.  I don't care how many good meals you serve, one ""I-could-have-been-seriously-injured-by-your-carelessness and ineptitude"" is all it takes.  

I realize there's probably not much you can do to satisfy a customer that was one swallow away from spending the rest of the day in the ER because of your stupidity, but here's a tip:  DON'T RUN AWAY AND HIDE FROM THEM EITHER.  

Way to run a business, guys. 

So go ahead and try your luck at Mezzo Bistro, people.  It is Vegas, after all, so if you feel like gambling with your life, knock yourself out.",kGGapvfP1SZH2ZOikdSpNA,18,2,1,HSoe-N02F3Mi-BQ9z52xVw

  I was taken by my boyfriend to your resturat for Valentine's Day! IT WAS HORRIBLE from the service to the food! Seriously we both work in the food industry (hes a GM) and it just blew my mind how things were handled in your restaurant... 1st we sat at the bar and didn't get acknowledged so when our table was available we sat for a good 10 min before we were asked what we were drinking.... I'm assuming he was the busier he explained he could only get non-alcoholic drinks.....  We were given little 4oz glasses not even filled up? Is that a joke? The couple next to us had real water glasses!!! Then the server came about 10 min later we ordered our wine and beer... He came back with my beer and told my boyfriend they were looking for his wine.... 20 min later it was ""unavailable"" Took over an hour to get out food as your server mike came to the table and says ""sir 10 more SECONDS!!!!!!!!!!!! really it was 30 min later we arrived at 6:45 and hadn't got our dinner till 8:20!!!! You do the math!... really spaghetti!!!

Didn't even offer to buy us a drink!!!!!! The couple next to us was just as UN happy with your servers lies and excuses! They WERE your customer's for 2yrs and they wont be back...

5793285,2011-05-10,2,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Our first mistake was deciding on where to go for dinner a little late in the evening. When we arrived I was super hungry. We had two servers, neither of which could seem to serve us with any decency in speed or clarity. By the time our food arrived, I felt like I had already been in the restaurant way too long. There were quite a few other patrons in the place, but it wasn't packed with a wait to be seated. 

My second mistake was assuming that Tea is unflavored. No, it's Passion Fruit Tea. Adam Carolla has a rant about Passion Fruit Tea, and I am thinking of joining his Army after my experience at Mezzo. All she had to do was to give me a heads up. Heck, I might have even ordered it even knowing, but when I took a sip of my tea, expecting a familiar taste only to find that I had been fooled. 

My food was good, but maybe it was just because I was so starved by the time it arrived that I would have enjoyed a shoe just as much. 

I can say ONE positive thing about Mezzo, and it's that their Pizza Frittes dessert is PHENOMENAL! They're fried dough bites with powered sugar, similar to bits of funnel cake. I ordered mine to go (since we had been there so long that I felt like I had moved into the place), and they piled them high in the take out box. They were even good the next day. I would go back to Mezzo just for the Pizza Frittes but definitely get them to go....without the tea.",R1xxRcTY3RpfDtGjisYEjg,2,1,2,HNWethSDTAlp4UWOw2CX4g

It's the best I've ever had. I also had the veal one night, and it was also delicious. And not to forget, the cheese and portobello mushroom appetizer is amazing!",e0uXa6QykjUMf-yHZHh4NA,0,1,5,F7ZWoSkY2PBRfmvjxWhDWA
5813591,2015-07-30,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"Oh my goodness!!  This place is awesome!!  The food and service were excellent.  For appetizers we ordered calamari and the portobello mushroom.  The mushroom was sliced and on a bed of fresh spinach, topped with 4 cheeses and a sauce that I wish I had gotten the name of. The cheeses were melted but the dish was not heated so much that the spinach was wilted.  I didn't eat the calamari but my sisters and daughter said it was good.  
I ordered the gnocchi for the first time ever and it was delicious!  I couldn't eat a lot because it is a heavy dish but the dumplings were so tender.  I tasted my daughters grilled salmon and it was also delicious. 
Great food and great service.  Can't wait to go back.",79Ea49GrBLDPQMewNGtSlw,5,2,5,ypRo_tChpFAgG7Qzemg6lw
5837948,2012-02-06,4,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"This was a pleasant new find for me.  Armed with a Groupon, and accompanied by another couple, I knew nothing about this bistro except that it served Italian food.  So, I gave it a full gustatory workout to see what it might bring to the table.

We opened with very good fresh Italian bread and Fried Calamari with peperoncini added.  This appetizer came with a mild Marinara Sauce, and my request for Lemon Aioli as an additional dipping choice was graciously accommodated without charge.  As for the Calamari itself, the rings were very good, somewhat better tasting than the tentacles.  Requested butter was quickly provided for the bread.  
 
Italian Wedding Soup was very odd.  It contained spinach leaves as expected, but also cut carrots and a lot of white chicken meat.  I had to send it back, because it wasn't very hot and contained no meatballs as Italian Wedding Soup should.  The restaurant manager and co-owner who was making the rounds of tables agreed; normally included meatballs were missing from my bowl.  When it returned, the small meatballs were the best part, but I didn't like the included tiny tubular pasta noodles that much.

The rest of the dinner soared.  A dinner-size classic Caesar Salad contained firm green leaves of Romaine Lettuce, crunchy croutons, and a good creamy Caesar Dressing.  The portion was generous and took awhile to finish.  The huge portion of Eggplant Parmesan that immediately followed was cheesy, saucy, and quite delicious--magnificent, and the best of its kind I have ever eaten.  My fellow diners were also pleased with their food.  A brick of Meat Lasagna and Veal Alfredo looked particularly appealing.

There was no room or time for any dessert.  We had to dash off to the Cannery to arrive in time to see the last scheduled performance of ""Red Tails"" on its opening night.  I will sample Mezzo Italian Bistro's several dessert offerings on another day.

Seating was comfortable in the cozy bistro, our servers were friendly, and service was good.  Dinner and the movie that followed constituted a fine night out!  A reprise will soon be in order.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,17,7,4,asu2j7XbjzuISHHNRp-ynA
5866550,2017-08-12,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,The food was good but the service is the reason I will not be back.  I can understand slow service on a busy night. However the server was just not friendly and boarder line rude.  It was my birthday dinner and I can honestly say the server really put a damper on the evening.  *Meh*,3xESvNr3bkJikpjLRqcBcA,1,0,3,JsiUOCQo-vJFaZzQfb1g4A

5907683,2015-08-25,3,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,"So I ended up here last night because Don Michaels was closed. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The menu had a good variety. I assumed that the entrées came with soup or salad. We were a party of 3 and each ordered a regular pasta dish with chicken added and 2 soft drinks and water, our bill was $77! The food was ok but not like wow that's good stuff. It's overpriced considering all you get is white bread with your meal. I'm still in shock about the cost, service was decent. Our waiter apparently serviced the entire restaurant by himself. 

This was a first and last time I will dine here, there's other establishments much better with better prices",864uMSFGP4_muuDV6hJsbQ,1,1,2,RzyZD2xQUanBHRY-kRcP3g

Our server was fast, and made sure we had everything we needed.  We enjoyed the fresh hot bread served with oil, vinegar and pepper. We will be back as often as we can to enjoy this beautiful establishment.",UgRB62GSTDX7hJhFvSX58A,0,0,5,X0KtD2mK2QRPy5r6zZpIjg
5952655,2016-06-25,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,Armando and Christian are too hard workers. They both we staying busy and very attentive to there guests. Tonight we also got the pleasure to met the owner Sean. Who checked on us to see how our meal and wine were tasting. This is a great local spot where they are always running yummy specials. This place is perfect for all occasions. Romantic dates and family get togethers. My wife and I will defiantly me back for those huge meatballs they were so tasty.,ElEr37Nl6NLuo0My3F33Eg,2,0,5,RM3k58pGkkILPTKrwiRamw
5978229,2015-10-20,1,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,First off service was excellent. Decided to go here based on having a restaurant.com gift card. Server explained that only one $25 gift certificate could be used on a visit and only once a month. Pricing for food was very expensive for the quality. Didn't order desert but all desserts were about $7. Wine was excellent. If they lower the food prices or serve better quality this would a great place to eat. Otherwise I would only recommend enjoying a glass of wine or two.,lJ_ihpv1I1W7fnCUnI8zHQ,1,1,3,MbhKQCQ9EZfqht4Vm9QsGw

5985244,2011-10-16,0,h3pMMRwqBjMeMtk0_qQzRQ,Solid three star. I probably won't return but the food was acceptable. There are just so many better places to eat! We had a restaurant.com coupon so we took the drive from the strip to try it out. We ordered the meatball and asparagus appetizers and the calabrese pizza. The meatballs were large but very dense with a tomato sauce that wasn't very flavorful. The asparagus was fine but I would have preferred the prosciutto to be wrapped around the asparagus instead of a couple slices on top. The pizza was a big disappointment. Wood fired was advertised and you could see the pizza oven but the final product was not up to par. The pizza kind of looked like a take and bake pizza and it was undercooked. Had canoli for dessert and it was fine. Total bill was ~$40 (one iced tea to drink). Service was friendly but the food needs some work to compete in Vegas.,eectGb7-g_Xx7ftGqxr5bg,2,0,3,eIEbFI8bOjkXcbyq8ofjCg
