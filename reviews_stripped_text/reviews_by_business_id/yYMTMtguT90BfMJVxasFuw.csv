The food was really good! It came out fresh and hot in very generous proportions. The lunch specials are definitely the way to go if you can make your mind up on only having one dish. 
When you walk inside at first it is a little confusing if it's a sit-down and order, or go to the counter and order sort of place, but They will cater to both sit-down and take-out. 
Furthermore, prices are more than reasonable especially for the amount of food given and the location is easily accessible. -B",-nz0wxpNjlNzS6ttpcXurA,1,1,4,65j2BFD5Bbwpj1gb7XIXUA

Bleyck! I spent like $20 on 2 items and they are both going in the trash.  I'm not calling to argue with them and i'm certainly not taking it back because then I've made 2 trips and I really don't want them to replace it with anything.  I won't eat here again.  I've never even written a review of a restaurant but it was so yuck I had to. 

I ordered veggie chow mein and honey walnut shrimp.  The shrimp was absolutely swimming in sauce, like drowning in it, and it took me taking it out of the container and putting it on paper towels FOUR times to get the excess off.  Secondly, for those who don't know, honey walnut shrimp uses mayo in the sauce.  They had used so much that I could see white swirls in my (strangely lurid ORANGE colored) sauce and it tasted more like mayo than it did anything else.  After that it was partially edible but the taste is off (no it's not bad shrimp ""off"") and didn't taste honey or walnut at all. 

The chow mein tasted greasy.  When I looked in the container afterward I could see at the bottom a good half inch of oil just sitting there.  The noodles were drenched.  Even my dogs who love to beg had no interest in trying a noodle and they've eaten stuff off the side of the road. 

I have no idea how this place got 4 and 5 stars previously.  No idea at all.  I will NEVER go back.",M0WU8XCVFBrEe-784F5TGg,3,0,1,vr8E-N8kjy9N09oiDWU_BA

I had the general tso's chicken lunch special for about 6 dollars and was pleased(free drink included). Coating was still crispy, sauce was flavorful and not overly spicy, and to top it off the chow mein was thick and not too oily.

The number of good reviews attracted my eye to this tiny make-to-order restaurant almost hidden in a strip mall near our house in Summerlin.  

I called in wor won ton soup, sesame chicken, string bean beef, moo goo gai pan and vegetable chow mein to a very friendly girl on the phone.  They had it ready to go in less than 10 minutes so it was waiting for me when I arrived.  The meats are tender without being chewy or fatty, the sauces are satisfying without over-the-top sodium and the chef's vegetable choices did not obsess on bell peppers nor large unwelcome chunks of yellow onion.  

Every dish was great!  My taste favored the moo goo gai pan and the chow mein.  Wor won ton survived the challenge of serving piping hot broth that doesn't over cook the vegetables once poured in the to-go container but the broth was somehow lacking something.

This Chinese restaurant is freakin' awesome.  Service is prompt, courteous, and they only came by THREE TIMES to ask if everything was ok.  Try and get that somewhere else... where you're ignored and lack for even water refills.

The hot tea was steaming.  The egg-flower soup was steaming. The steamed dumplings were ... um... steaming!  The beef&broc were fresh.  [Ok, they could have cut the humongous beef pieces into bite-sizes].  The fried rice and noodles were scrumptious.  

I asked for chili paste... got offered that or Sriracha (how can you go wrong when you offer both?)  Also the chili paste in the egg-flower soup made it deliciously hot and hot[spicy].  Killer combination.  Next time I'll try the hot&sour soup and hold off on the chili.

Food was HOT and FRESH and DAMN DELICIOUS.  Would go back in a heartbeat.  Took a delivery-menu so I can repeat the process without going there.  [Eating there was fine... just delivery is sometimes easier.]

While I was there I did not see Chinese people eating... which is at times a bad sign... but not in this case.  I saw four other people having a great meal.  

What could they improve: not much.  It's all good.  When you walk in it's very 'small town' when they ask you if you've pre-ordered... if it's takeout or dine here...  so on the one side they could ""polish"" that process up, but on the other side it's down-home-style.

GO EAT THERE.

The food was literally swimming in grease. The fried rice was soooo greasy. I have never had fried rice that wet before. Yuck. The general chicken was soggy, likely from all that grease, and came with onions, pineapples and bell peppers. It reminded me of sweet and sour chicken, and nothing like general chicken as there was hardly any spice. The kung pao beef had a good flavor, but was also very oily. The crab rangoons were the best.

We got the vegetable chow mein ,fried rice and the  tofu and veggies .

I placed my order through the yelp delivery app and had a few customizations. They called me and confirmed how I wanted everything. That's great quality service. 

The delivery was very fast and best of all , the food was warm, not cold . 

The actual taste of the food was great. Tons of veggies. And as far as the tofu goes , very good flavoring on it.

2290501,2013-02-01,0,yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw,"Still no Brown Rice here. Have called twice hoping they have added it to the menu. Got a tip from a helpful Yelper with good intentions, saying ""They have brown rice"" so we decided to give it a shot, only to find out that they don't have brown rice. Fried Rice could have been mistaken for brown rice, maybe?

Reasonably solid American Chinese (would be 5-stars in an overrated city like Nashville.) But, China One on Rainbow is still far and away my favorite. The similarities between the two restaurants are many, down to the styrofoam bowl of egg-drop soup (although China Gourmet's is way too thick). It is painfully obvious that they did a lot of homework before opening this place. Too bad being booksmart is only half the battle...

As we were leaving China Gourmet, I was walking by one of the other customer's plates of food, and I was surprised to see his General Tso's Chicken was an unnatural reddish-orange color. Food coloring in Chinese food is so 1980s! The last time I saw chicken that color was at a crappy neighborhood Chinese joint in Southwest Denver.

A good effort, but the overall effect is of a fake iPhone. This place so desperately wants to be China One, but it misses the mark by a mile! Suspect food coloring aside, Asian restaurants that care serve Brown Rice. (You can quote me on that.)",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,5,2,3,nIUAHN6Z0yvZ_1bDYzoS5A

Anyways.  I give this place pretty high marks.  First they said it would take 45 minutes to get here which is a typical type of delivery window and it took the guy like 20 minutes.  So hooray for that cuz I'm sick and that was a welcome surprise.

Second everything was super fresh.  That's a big plus for me.  I will admit the Wor Wonton soup could have used a little salt but that was a small price to pay for the deliciously fresh ingredients.  Tender meats and generous portion.  

The sample appetizer was also good.  Fresh and tasty.  The Shanghai noodles were very curry-isn and again, fresh crisp veggies and good meat.  A little salt again could be added but no biggie.

Even the crispy friend wonton strips were big and freshly fried and not greasy.  It's like they just care and go a little above and beyond.  All utensils and sauces were included.  I definitely recommend this place.

THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR OWN COUPONS!!!
I had a coupon for a free appetizer after you spend a certain amount.
Nevermind the fact that the DAY BEFORE I received the coupons in the mail, I went here to dine-in and spent almost $50.
But the day I want to use a coupon for a measly free $6 appetizer, I was told no because you cannot have chicken wings for free.

Chicken wings -- super flavorful and packed with roasted garlic bits, jalapeño slices, green onion and red chili peppers. 

I do not eat rice, I always get noodles and lately I have been ordering the beef lo mein -- I chose Well, the meat is super tender and juicy. 

Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, Kung Pao etc. it's all good, just eat it. 

I normally never get seafood at Chinese restaurants or anywhere where I am not familiar with their sourcing because I do NOT want to eat farmed seafood (gross) so I can't comment on the quality of the fishes-dishes. 

China Gourmet is definitely a great provider of delicious, greasy carbs for your hangover days and lately I have been relying on them for my post-break-up-face-stuffing-on-the-weekend.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,0,1,4,KZTJ369pCuiOWV4ShiM_Qw

The rice and garlic chicken were packed in standard take out containers now made without wire handles.  My noodles were in a styrofoam box.  The bag had napkins, soy sauce, and plastic spoons.

We ventured here on strong recommendation from friends and my daughter loves this spot. 
The location is more designed for take away, with few cabins for lunch n dinner. The food is what they get you with. Being a take-away design, food is served in ToGO plates with plastic spoon/knife. They make sure you understand that before you order, which is kind of nice to lay out expectation ahead of time. 
We were three of us and each one ordered a different dishs - Kung Pao Chicken, Salt n Pepper Greens and Egg fried rice.
Oh boy each items was super delicious, on the mark - its was a treat. End of it all it costs less then $35 total bill - what a bargain for that quality n taste of food. I will most certainly return

4560215,2014-05-15,3,yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw,"I was really excited to try this place! I was grabbing myself some Cafe Rio after a long day and decided to pickup some food for my parents at China Gourmet.

I suppose the issue started when I was ordering the food. I told the girl taking my order that the first few dishes were vegetarian, no meat, fish or eggs and to please substitute tofu. I asked to make sure that they did not use fish sauce and she said 'no we don't use that.' So I proceeded with my order and after each vegetarian dish I stated, no meat, subsitute tofu please. The last dish I ordered was a chicken dish for my father (as he does eat meat).

I did not wait long for my food and the girl was nice enough to bring it out to my table. 

My mom dished out the food and I checked to make sure she did not open the chicken dish (as she too is a vegetarian). I opened the tofu dish and it looked really strange so I took a bite of the food and of course it was meat, I was disgusted. I had bitten into a piece of pork, I had to wash my mouth out. The 'ma po tofu' dish was listed under pork and I specifically told the girl taking my order that I did not want meat. 

I decided I would call to fix the issue, I knew it was a mistake and that there was obviously some sort of miscommunication. I call and speak to a girl (I was not sure if this was the same girl that took my order). I told her what happened and she told me that she took my order and that I never told her that I was a vegetarian. I then stated that I have been a vegetarian for over 10 years and I am fully aware of how to order vegetarian food. I tried to deescalate the situation because it seemed as though the girl was getting defensive and it was a simple mistake. I told her all that I wanted was a refund for the one dish and she said they would only give me credit.

I asked to speak with a manager (because I did not want credit, I wanted a refund for the dish that they did not execute properly. The manager stated that she overhead me order and that I did not state that I did not eat meat and I ordered a meat dish so they would not give me a refund and they would only give me store credit. At that point I became very frustrated. I have worked in customer service industry for over 9 years and I have been in food service for 5 years. If there is one thing I know, it is customer service and she was not treating me like a valued customer. I then told the 'manager' that I did in fact order a meat dish for my father and that I ordered 3 vegetarian dishes for my mother and I as eating meat is aganist our religion. I also told her that after every dish that was vegetarian that I would say 'no meat, substitue tofu.' She proceeded to tell me that it was my fault and we went back and forth. Then she hung up on me.

Maybe I should have checked the food before leaving the establishment. Regardless, I will never frequent this establishment again in the future. Possibly the WORST customer service experience I have had and a complete lack of respect for dietary/religious restrictions.",gJpvYNvxsyJxN-uiznbl6Q,2,0,1,I1gMdRC4r0pOsX6fBXRGHA

4655175,2013-11-10,3,yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw,"After a haircut at Fantastic Sam's, it was time to cut my hunger at China Gourmet. By the time I finished my meal, my opinion is that China Gourmet  shines at lunch specials but is outshined by New York Chinese Restaurant 1.3 miles south on Fort Apache Road.

  China Gourmet stands near Carl Jr ( more $ than China Gourmet during lunch ) in an abandoned Smith's shopping center in the northeast corner of Fort Apache and Sahara. With that in mind there are acres of available parking spaces. When you get close to the restaurant, you will see a sign advertising that a beverage is included with the lunch special (a Yelp tip also advertised this). This might draw you closer to the restaurant. What I appreciate is that outside the restaurant the menu is posted. I could be indecisive to the degree that I don't want to be rushed making a choice. On this menu are the lunch specials ranging from $5.95 to $6.55. Just like the lion's share of Chinese restaurant specials the $6.55 items are shrimp-based. 

  If you decide you want to dine in China Gourmet, you will step inside a dining area that lacks fanciness. It is a similar interior to places including China Go Go and China One. In all honesty, some of the renovated Panda Expresses are fancier. A short distance past the tables, a friendly employee will direct you to sit at a table if your dining in. At the end of the meal you pay and on your judgment tip.

  I ordered the peppersteak. The special included soup of the day-which is no surprise egg drop soup served in a Styrofoam bowl and crunchy noodles before the entree. I am tired of egg drop soup. I feel that Chinese restaurants should follow the example of N.Y. Chinese Restaurant by offering won ton soup with the meal. Fast forward a few minutes later, and I set eyes on peppersteak, chow mien noodles, and fried rice. Just like Bobby. Y addressed brown rice is nonexistent here. The peppersteak was good stuff. However, half the plate was taken up by the soft chow mien noodles. My tastebuds consider them a filler and a waste of calories. When I left, the employee filled up my Styrofoam cup of Pepsi and thanked me for my business. 

  China Gourmet is a good Chinese restaurant that outbeats several fast food places with a less expensive price than Panda Express during lunch. However, New York Chinese Restaurant 1.3 miles south on Fort Apache at Spring Mountain Road is a star-and-a-half better.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,4,4,3,2BtnqDubUkRklXThZchX5g

I think I'm going to have this again tomorrow cause I really want to try their chow mien. The delivery was super fast and everything was fresh. The customer service is okay but the food is so good I can overlook some things. Their portions are a good size and the prices are great for what you get. The shrimp in the fried rice is huge! The honey walnut shrimp is to die for and the cream cheese wontons are addicting. Everything I've had so far has been delicious.

We decided to visit China Gourmet last week for dinner based on others reviews and were not disappointed! This place looks very clean and comfortable.  The staff were all smiles when we walked in and once our order was placed we quickly received our dishes and each was delicious and impressive in taste.  The Tso Chicken was actually somewhat spicy! So many places I have visited in the past that had spicy dishes that didn't deliver the heat.  We both agree that we have found our new spot for great Chinese food!

I love Chinese and Thai food but I won't risk it! I know that cross contamination happens all of the time in kitchens but After ordering from them more than 10 times I've never had a single problem! Every time I order I get a phone call checking my allergies and my very very picky order! I am a nightmare customer! I have food allergies, I am picky and very hard to please, I hate mini corn, I sub this for that ask for extra garlic in all dishes, XTRA soy sauce, boba tea with no boba! They always deliver perfect on time fresh food! My favorite when I'm sick I order the egg flower soup and they take out the baby corn, add tons of garlic and onions and hot peppers! Their Chow Mein is incredible never mushy, always fresh! Their fried rice is amazing! I love their pork fried rice, their BBQ pork is amazing, always fresh and the pork is tender, not over cooked or fatty. I usually hate chicken dishes from Chinese places. I have ordered Moo goo guy pan, spicy garlic chicken, sweet and sour chicken and their appetizer ground chicken and onion pan fried dumplings. Everything I have ordered was perfect flavor, and all white meat chicken once again the veggies fresh colorful aldente'. My husband loves the broccoli with Beef.

I'm not opposed to walking, it's just hard to manage two small kids and a bag of Chinese food across the busy parking lot. But the food is excellent.

5011477,2018-01-23,0,yYMTMtguT90BfMJVxasFuw,"Glad that we finally tried this spot. Ordered for pickup via Eat24, and was pleased with the speed with which our food was ready.

We tried the egg rolls, Hong Kong style crispy noodles, shrimp egg foo young, and chicken fried rice. (Yes, it was a cold, Chinese comfort food sort of night.) All the dishes were good--well executed and, seemingly, for inexpensive Chinese takeout, healthfully prepared; the food didn't seem insanely salty (again, from a relative standpoint), and it wasn't prepared using MSG (always nice not to have that telltale post-meal reaction).

The prices were reasonable, and the portions good-sized. The chicken fried rice seemed like a particularly good deal ($6.25 for a large container).

I agree with the previous reviewer that, for New York City expats like myself, this Chinese takeout spot is a decent choice. On the Chinese takeout spectrum that exists outside of New York--from Middle-America-mall-food-court food to somewhat-reminiscent-of-what-you-can-order-anywhere-in-the-city--China Gourmet's food falls toward the latter end.

I was disappointed to find that as soon as the order processed, the estimated delivery time changed to a full hour. I made myself wait, however, telling myself it would taste better if I was hungrier, but that hour slowly stretched to an hour and twenty-five minutes. I eventually called the restaurant to ask what happened and then was told that someone was on the way. They arrived about 10-15 minutes after the phone call. The delivery man pressured me for a tip before handing me my food, which was extremely disrespectful and uncomfortable. 
The food was lukewarm. It had obviously been sitting out and none of it tasted fresh. The orange chicken was dry and so was the steamed rice. 
:( I'm really disappointed as I expected much better from the reviews. Maybe it's just best to take-out or go in to eat, but I definitely won't order delivery from them again.

There are so many Chinese/Asian restaurants in Las Vegas, it's usually just a matter of going to the closest one to where we are at at the time. Generally speaking, menu items, taste and preparation is very similar with Chinese food, so it really comes down to the freshness of the food and the service for us.

The owners own 4 restaurants and this is their third China Gourmet that they have opened up. It's pretty apparent they know what they're doing. The establishment is clean, spacious and in a great location on the westside right at the corner of Sahara Ave and Fort Apache. 

We wanted to try a few items, so we ordered the Happy Family (a delicious mix of shrimp, chicken, beef and assortment of vegetables in a brown sauce), Combination Chow Mein (chicken, beef and shrimp with soft noodles), Mongolian Beef, egg drop soup (on the house) and delicious cream cheese filled rangoons.

The food was super fresh, piping hot, delicious and very reasonably priced, but what impressed us most was the service. From the sweet, warm greeting we received as we walked into the restaurant, to the smiling, friendly server, to how accommodating they were in trying to please us, for example, the Mongolian Beef usually comes with green peppers and is spicy, which my wife doesn't like. She prefers onions and green onions and mild on the heat. They were more than happy to prepare the dish this way for her and gave her some of their delicious home-made hot sauce on the side. This hot sauce is awesome!! I personally love hot food, so their home-made hot sauce was a great addition to all the dishes for me.

The owners Mike and Vicky came over to our table and introduced themselves. Lovely warm, friendly people who have a passion for their business, truly appreciate their customers and want to please them, and definitely know how to run a good restaurant with their experience as owners of several restaurants. 

They were so sweet to us last night, I just wanted to reciprocate in some way by giving them a good ""plug"" on Yelp. We wish them tons of luck of success with their newest venture and ask that as many of you as possible try China Gourmet on 9002 W. Sahara Ave, Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed!",-2hidejdlLTQfzVtAM0Ujw,6,1,5,WLGu8ORZayMxzDbD_vDVMg

Giving bad review is not my cup of tea (pun intended ;)) but after the experience with this place, my goodness!

Went in for a couple boba drinks: coconut and Thai tea. -- while the rest of my family was next door at Cafe Rio. Lady makes Thai tea with freaking Coffee Mate. Yeah. If you're familiar with what goes in a Thai tea, Coffee Mate isn't it. It's a dash of coconut milk. Easy. Wanted my money back after walking out and changing my mind. My kid had taken a sip and the older lady was yelling at me refusing my refund. Anyway. Got my $3,50 back. 

After this, I don't even want to know what's in their food.",AKJupZmv29L_WFKwxm9dGQ,3,0,1,qe1S69_GSZcw0qC_KFXxJg

They have good customer service and seem like good people. They didn't tell me about the coupons my 1st order tho. They have coupons that are like buy over 25$ get a free appetizer etc. I didn't try the dumplings, cause I like the home made kind, n the ones here look store bought. I like the beef dishes here mostly & veggie. The Walnut shrimp was awesome.",N26-dXhOoB3gHhX6meMMNw,0,0,4,c0kzQOVYLFZKaCMo2gvsOA
