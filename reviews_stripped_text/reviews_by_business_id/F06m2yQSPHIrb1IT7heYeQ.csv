I decided to order the beef chow fun. The beef was tender, flavorful and could cut with a fork. Noodles were perfect! My son had the Pork Shoulder with pickled vegetables, tender, melt in your mouth kind of dish.. the light broth that it was served in.. incredible.. !!

We got the beef chow fun ?????), the salted fish, chicken, and tofu clay pot (????????, and  some bright red sweet meat dish - maybe sweet and sour? Mom claims the chow fun is her test of a restaurant, since it is hard to make well. The noodles were the right chewiness, didn't stick in clumps, and and the flavor met our smoky wok expectations. The clay pot was great - the right level of saltiness and very nicely presented. The sweet pork dish was very sweet. Not my cup of tea, but Dad enjoyed it. 

Pros: 
- Large, clean restaurant 
- Well-executed dishes 
- Unexpectedly good service for a Chinese restaurant - our tea was constantly refilled, the guy stopped to ask how the food was 

Cons:
- The menu is dominated by Americanized Chinese dishes, so dining options are a bit scarce if you're looking for authentic Chinese food 
- The guy was a bit dour. Cracking a smile wouldn't hurt. :)",2HGcieV3PL-rTQA3zjyghA,1,1,4,9DAlD4s_-MnSGFw8mcaLwg

1409481,2016-11-18,1,F06m2yQSPHIrb1IT7heYeQ,"Came here for dinner with some friends on a COLD Wednesday evening. My friend has been wanting to come here since this one opened. I and another friend had came here previously and had pretty good experience. 

She wanted a specific style of cooked crab which is directly translated to ""typhoon shelter crab"" but in Cantonese, its ""bei fung tong"" style. Its a style where the crab is lightly battered and fried, topped and quickly tossed in a mountain of chopped garlic and chili. Their style had a slightly sweet sauce tossed with the crab (similar to something like the thai style sweet chili sauce) with the garlic and chili. Technically this item isn't on the menu but still critiquing their version of it anyway. Crab itself was a decent size. The meat texture was a bit soft, usually meaning its not so fresh. The first time I came here, the meat texture was perfectly fresh. Super good. This time was a bit disappointing. Flavor wise, it was pretty good. Tho the sweet chili sauce was kind of different because I believe the normal version is more of a dry style seasoned with salt n pepper. The garlic was still yummy but the chilis were not spicy at all.

Aside from the crab, we had ordered fermented bean curd chili on choy, soy sauce chicken (because a review said it was good), and sweet and sour pork chop. 

Fermented bean curd with sliced chili On choy is a favorite of my friends and we typically order it almost every time we go to a Chinese restaurant. Good amount and flavored well. Same about the chilis not being spicy but at least overall it was good. 

Sweet and sour pork chop... is sweet n sour pork chop... XD our uh not Chinese friend (but still Asian... tryin not to name names here...) still enjoyed it. 

Soy sauce chicken was probably the most disappointing one. Amount was small even for a half order. Meat was tough. Not sure what kind of chicken they use. I'd assume its the frozen type but judging by size, it may be a range-free one. The flavor of the soy sauce they use was a little less sweet than from what I'm used to (great to mix with plain white rice.. XD). 

Aside from the 4 dishes we ordered, we were served with their house soup which I believe was a winter melon soup and a red bean soup dessert at the end of our meal. The soup was good though they didn't ask if we wanted more of the soup. (it was a cold evening and i was super hungry after work as i had not eating since before work like 11 hours prior) The red bean soup was a bit thin and the red bean were all completely masserated",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,3,J2r-ADlcWu9lmycuTomSJQ

The salt and pepper pork could use some jalapeño slices for kick, the orange chicken was not breaded that's good and fish filet in black bean sauce.

1861084,2018-01-03,0,F06m2yQSPHIrb1IT7heYeQ,"The food is good... but the organization and customer service is terrible and proportion size of food is inconsistent. Mind you...we are regulars and it's after the 3rd time the same thing happened that I'm sitting here with my elders complaining and disastisfied the entire meal that I am writing this. Not a pleasant dining experience if you ask me. 

We are the first party to arrive and our waitress sees more parties rolling in she advises us to hurry with our order so we can get our ticket in first.... after she puts it in more parties continue to arrive and sit down. Then both chefs took turns walking out to greet the table next to us (they walked in way after us)... and soon as the food is coming out... about 4 tables (all who came after us) got their food... some of which was also on our list. The waitress  helps us ask and she said they thought they already made everything on our list.... well okay then but when our stuff comes out its made half assedly compared to other tables and wasnt even enough to give each adult 1 piece. We had 7 adults and the dish only had 5 pieces of ""fresh yam"" (not even a premium ingredient). Also 2 of the dishes we ordered was distinctively less than the last time we ordered it... and for the price it really didnt seem worth it. All the waitress could do for us was apologize and say she can't say anything to the chefs or she will get yelled at. 

What's worse is that there is no management on staff and no one could address our issue. And some other waitress who isn't even servicing us butts in to say we can't help you we only deliver the food as it comes out. Not like we can give you their food.... (but like i mentioned a few of those things were the same ones we ordered.) 

I really hope someone takes the time to read this. Its the third time the same thing happened where everyone after us gets their food and our table is forgotten... all we hear are excuses and no compensation for our wasted time. We brought our kids to dine too... we were lucky they had more patience tonight than most nights. We really like the food and flavors you make but we will not be coming back for a while.

Tea was brought out as soon as we sat, but the tea was very bland, tasted nothing. Our waitress was very nice, answered questions and made recommendations, thumbs up for the fact that they have staff that speaks English unlike other Chinese restaurants around town. 

We ordered egg drop soup which was pretty good,, very light and healthy. We got soy sauce chicken which was really flavorful but the half chicken was pretty small for the price. Stir fried green beans and snow peas were both very good, great flavors and the veggies tasted very fresh. 

The pork shoulder with veggies looked good was tasted ok, too sweet for my taste. Clams with black bean sauce was good but lots of shells and very little actual clams (like most places)! 

The stand out item was hands down the Walnut shrimp. The shrimps were crispy, sauce was delicious, nuts wee sweet and crunchy and nicely played with very fresh broccoli (these broccoli were probably the greenest broccoli I have ever seen)! 

The only complaint is that typical of a Chinese place, the food did not all come out at the same time. We were Amati finished with our meal when the pork shoulder was brought out. 

Overall we ordered 8 dishes and the check came out under $100! Really good prices! Impressed with the place and will definitely return.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,2,4,4s4hnQTiKXPWsjvoQA6l3Q

When this place first opened the food was very inconsistent and the workers were all scrambled and confused not knowing what to do. Now there is a whole new set of workers. Also, the prices are pretty low considering the dishes are huge. Much like most Chinese restaurants, every order comes with complimentary soup, complimentary dessert, white rice, and tea. Just like every Chinese restaurant, if you don't see an item on the menu, you can request it and they'll make it. I've ordered Chow Fun with scrambled eggs and shrimp (which isn't on the menu, but if you request it, they'll make it). My two favorite dishes would probably be the clams with black bean sauce and the salt and pepper pork chops. If you've never tried authentic Chinese food I would definitely give this restaurant a try. Some popular dishes I would recommend for first timers that have never tried Chinese food would be: Dry Beef Chow Fun, salt and pepper pork chops, or clams with black bean sauce. The menu has lots of items to choose from and the popular dishes have pictures of the item on the menu. Overall, this is a really good restaurant that isn't located in Chinatown. Only reason for the 4 star rating is that the workers can be inattentive sometimes and sometimes leave dirty tables out and the garbage tray out.

+Food is consistent in quality and portion size is big

+Price of the food is low for the portion size

We finally decided on the egg drop soup, snow pea leaves, salt and pepper fish and the pan fried chow mein.  The food did not disappoint.  To anyone who knows Chinese food, it was definitely on the pricier side, but the portions are huge which made it worth it.

I've since been back a second time and we ordered their hot and sour soup, salt and pepper tofu, salt and pepper pork chop, beef chow fun, house special steamed chicken and the snow pea leaves (again).

Between crawling on the table and the wall connected to our table, I counted a total of 6 ants. Completely disgusted by that and the fact that when I brought it up to the staff, he kills an ant on site by squishing it with his finger and then just walks away like it's normal.

Yes, they do have Americanized items on their menu but if you have a favorite Chinese dish, ask them if they can make it. I asked for a scrambled egg shrimp noodle dish, not on the menu, and they made it deliciously! Could be the best version in Las Vegas. 

You should also try their version of Walnut Prawn because they actually use prawns and not the smaller shrimp.

We arrived around 7p & were immediately seated in a booth. There were several large Chinese families enjoying dinner - I interpreted that as a good sign.

With help from our server (our eyes were maybe bigger than our stomach as we really hadn't eaten a true meal all day), we settled on wonton soup (it was quite cold & windy outside), bbq pork fried rice, beef & scrambled eggs (hubs choice) & honey walnut prawns (my choice).

The honey walnut prawns were perfect to me: the shrimp was large & slightly crisp with the sweet sauce, yet not drowning in it like other Chinese food restaurants. It was served with fresh, perfectly-cooked & crunchy American broccoli, & my favorite crunchy cooked walnuts. The fried rice & soup were a bit lacking in flavor, I thought. Hubs wasn't impressed with the beef scrambled eggs & opted not to take the rest home (which surprised our waiter).

Service was fine & food was delivered to our table fast. Everything was clean (extremely important to this germaphobe). I would definitely try this place again but the hubs may or may not (he's not one to give 2nd chances but he also didn't order our usual favorites).

5349183,2016-11-25,1,F06m2yQSPHIrb1IT7heYeQ,"Cantonese style cuisine? New restaurant? AND it's on the Southwest side of town?! We have got to try this! 

Two of my friends had already tried Rainbow Kitchen and one of them told me that it was pretty decent. Therefore, grabbed them and my boyfriend and we tried it one night. 

We ended up getting four different dishes: Cantonese styled garlic chili crab, ong choy cooked with preserved bean curd, sweet and sour pork chops, and half a soy sauce chicken. 

The Cantonese styled garlic chili crab is my favorite style of crab from a restaurant. It's essentially a crab that's lightly battered and fried with a mixture of garlic and chili. It's delicious and you can definitely just get that garlic/chili and mix it with rice. I must say that Rainbow Kitchen does a great job making this dish. It was delicious and aromatic. The only problem with it though is the crab. The crab itself didn't have a whole lot of meat and the meat was a little on the mushy side. What does that mean? it wasn't fresh. So the crab was probably half dead when they took it from the tank. The crabs here are also sold $40 per versus by the pound, which is a good and bad thing. Good cause if the crabs are big. Bad if the crabs are small. 

Ong choy with preserved bean curd is awesome. One of my favorite veggie dishes. Rainbow Kitchen does it well and gives you a very good sized portion. 

Sweet and sour pork is pretty normal. Nothing bad about it but nothing spectacular. It's usually one of those dishes that kids love to eat so it's become a customary dish that gets ordered no matter what. And in this case, this dish is for my boyfriend. Cantonese styled dishes aren't his thing :P

The soy sauce chicken wasn't that great. The flavor was good, like with most of their dishes. The chicken itself? No. It was rough and tough. I ate one piece and I couldn't bring myself to eat more because of how tough the meat was. The soy sauce is great to mix rice with though!

Aside from that, rice is included with your dinner. I don't believe there is a charge for rice like some Chinese places. There is also soup included with your meal. They typically serve it in the beginning. If you want more soup, be sure to let them know. They don't ask you if you want more .. they just take the bowl away :( Dessert is also included. Its typically what we call ""sugar water"" .. or you can just call it soup. They gave us red bean soup at the end of our meal and it was a bit watery. I personally don't like red bean soup so I pawned mine off to my friend. 

Overall. Decent. Hit and miss on the crab. Prices were average for a Chinese place. Service was so-so. Wish they would refill the rice without having to ask. My friends were starving so I don't think they got to eat enough rice. Not really sure if I would want to return because KJ may be a tad better.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,1,3,p-E9C_bMjeCoPD4ByA_hzg

I've been here over 10 times and some of my favorite dishes are the eggplant hot pot, Singapore noodles, (best I've ever had) pork cheek and mushrooms, string beans with x.o. sauce, and the pork chops with putting sauce. Hot items come out piping hot which is awesome because that's how it should be! Service is prompt, the restaurant is spacious and clean and best of all, I don't have to go to Chinatown to get authentic Chinese food.

I hope more people try this place, leave reviews and keep it going because this is a tremendous restaurant that needs to stick around!",Sjqmb8QItFE4u7CYg_3mqA,2,0,5,yyPyvG3B0l-gEcZIfgk-0A

The waiter recommended the Tilapia, steamed with green onions and ginger.  It was caught live and then steamed.  We also ordered the Ong Choy with Preserved Bean Curd (Foo Yi), 8 Jewel Hot Pot & Soya Chicken.  

Delicious lunch was had by all!",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,1,1,4,rFl1axVZ0s71JamUGVl0FA

If I wanted to make my own food I wouldn't have bothered here.  Orange sauce was very thick, likely because it's supposed to be sautéed with with beef. Spring rolls were obviously from a box and sweet and sour sauce was watery at best and tiny considering they gave you 4 springs rolls. Maybe try this place for dine in but don't try take-out or delivery.",sXx8MVvxR18n0xGe5up_Zg,0,0,2,IM_YF2cJPaE2KkZW28iCfQ

I have been craving for congee so I came here. First thing I have noticed was the filthy glass door and windows. 
Older lady sweeping with a dash fan on her other hand served a customer with out washing her hands. 
Filthy windows should have stopped me from coming in.",ftttLxXB10LtHJ7v0j2hDA,1,0,3,Pku0yXk-7sfLyjNjlXEljA
