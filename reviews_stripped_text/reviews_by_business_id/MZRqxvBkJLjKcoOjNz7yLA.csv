The first time we had lunch, the dressing on the taco salad was decent, but it took 30 minutes for a taco salad, Carne Asad tacos and a bowl of soup.  They kept leaving the patio door open and we got up to close it multiple times...there was a chilly breeze blowing the whole time.

The second time was breakfast on a Sunday another 30 plus minute wait for 2 breakfast burritos that were very unimpressing.",nuFkDwNepjbyrS6eskGfhQ,1,0,1,wrszOAphKDCpliCkg7oOew

I'm pretty sure they use canned dog food for anything chicken related and not even the expensive brand...haha ohh god this place was just horrid! And we even gave it a few chances and it was always an awful experience! They should be embarrassed of their chips/salsa/guacamole...the salsa was definitely poured straight from a jar of salsa they bought at Walmart, and the ""table side guacamole""?!..might as well just bring your own avocado to chomp on and save yourself $10...another standard Mexican side dish you wouldn't think anyone could mess up..rice and beans! My beans looked like the poop emoji on the iPhone and the rice was a real crapshoot..my fianc√©'s rice randomly had green peas in it? So that was interesting....
And then the service..our waitress had no idea what any drink or lunch specials were...we had to convince her that there even were lunch specials by walking to the front of the restaurant and taking a picture of the display that listed them. The ONLY reason they got one star is because they did at least offer drink and food specials throughout the day (and because yelp makes you give at least one star..haha).

You just can't beat that!  It included three flavors of frozen margaritas: regular, strawberry and mango.  I asked the awesome bartender Cory to pour some extra tequila in there for me each time.  I tipped $1 or $2 each time he filled my solo cup and he gave us a fun show throwing bottles around, juggling them and being super nice.  We stayed from 10:30 pm to 1:30 am and it got really hopping around midnight for some interesting people watching. The DJ played really great tunes which got better closer to midnight when it was full on the dance floor.

Last year, this place was under construction, and we were pleased to find it finished this year and were excited about trying it out. 
We were there on a Saturday night, a bit on the later side, and right away I should have turned and left because the music in the place was just incredibly LOUD.  I'm no fuddy-duddy but to have to lean over and SCREAM to be heard is just not my cup of tea.  My fault there - even the waitress thought it was really loud and asked the DJ to notch it down.
We thought the food was good - we had the bean soup, and steak tacos.  But there were none of the usual ""extras"" offered such as crackers for the soup.  We basically had to beg for some carbs!   
Prices were a few dollars higher than they should have been.  Many of the items are slightly discounted if you have your players card with you.
I thought our server did a decent job.  Clearly she did not have a lot to work with.

First off my boyfriend and I went here for dinner around 8:00 pm. Only a handful of people were in the restaurant. Before going in to be seated I snapped a few pics of the rolling stones guys up front. I say that to set up what happened in the end. (Just keep this in mind). We were seated and the waitress came to take our drink orders. I ordered a water and my boyfriend order a raspberry tea. Immediately I get an attitude from our waitress because I ordered a water. (Strike 1) She brings back the drinks and says ""what would you like?"" I'm like ""we need a few more minutes to look over the menu.""  So she walks away without even saying anything.  She finally comes back after a good 15 min.  When the waitress does come back she decides to sit down and take our ordwers. WTF?!? (Strike 2) I order the Chimichonga and my boyfriend orders the steak tacos. Mean while .... I do not see our waitress again until she beings our food out which was about 30 min. Never came to check on us or refill our cups. Once they bring the meals out I still don't see our waitress. The food tasted old and tasteless. No type of seasoning or any love was thrown into the making of our meals. The tacos hardly had any steak just an abundance of lettuce. My food was just tasteless. I guess I'm just use to Rio Grande back in my hometown of MD. Nothing at this place was fresh. 

When we looked about done our waitress came to take our plates and she actually came back with the check right away. But.... why did she just stand there waiting for us to pay instead of going somewhere and tending to whatever else she gets paid to do? I mean who does that?  So I just looked at her and she got the hint. Forgot to mention that some chick came up to us while we were waiting for our order and slaps a hat on my boyfriend and says ""its resturant tradtion"" I was like what? She wanted him to wear a mexican hat and a silly mustashe so she could take a pic. She snaps a few pics and vanished. Dont worry.... towards the end she comes back with the pics asking us if we wanted to buy them. We both declined and she said ""it was worth a try."" So as soon as we pull our money out here comes our waitress. We give her only a $4.00 tip and she didnt deserve that but we were being nice. We leave out but not before I snap a pic of my boyfriend standing next to the Rolling Stone wax men and the hostess comes running up saying "" Ms. We do not allow people to take pictures with the wax models."" I was like ""wow, really!?"" Stupid chick unless she wanted to snatch my phone from me what the hell was she going to do about it. Worse food, even worse customer service and horrible staff!

1.  we saw our waitress 2 times in the 2 hours we were there.  the first time was after sitting for 20 minutes waiting for her to come take our order, and the second time was after waiting 30 minutes after finishing eating to have her bring us the bill.  no checking up to see how the food was, or to fill drinks at all

2.  the charlie burrito tastes like cheeseburger hamburger helper wrapped in a tortilla

3.  there is some stupid lady who comes up behind you and tries to put a hat on your head without any warning or asking.  she almost ended up with my dinner knife in her leg when she just slammed the hat on my head

My main reason for the two star rating is their unwillingness to accommodate their customers.  Apparently, they have a policy of not doing separate checks. There were six of us at our table, most of us using credit cards to pay.  The waitress basically said we had to figure out how much each of us owed and she could run each card one at a time, subtracting what we told her from the bill each time.  After ten minutes of trying to figure out the bill and how we would deal with the tax we finally got the manager and complained about the policy.  He ultimately agreed to do it for us and it took another ten minutes to separate everything in their computer with one of the members of our party helping him sort out the bill.

I have worked in three different restaurants in the past, not to mention have eaten in dozens of restaurants here in Vegas and never have I had a restaurant tell me they won't do separate checks.  Las Vegas is a top tourist destination in the entire world.  People come here in groups.  Why on earth would any restaurant have a policy like that in a city like this?  It defies logic and it's extremely inconvenient.  As someone who has waited tables and bartended in the past I do understand how annoying it can be to be asked to split a check for a large group at the end of the meal, but our waitress was asked up front and I didn't even show up until everyone else had finished eating so my check should have been easy to split off. 

I was not happy about us having to jerk around with this for twenty minutes when we were ready to leave.  Change your policy, folks.",Bf1tV5m4mrDgfCjVmme3ig,1,0,2,_zL22Fg4wfLP9yuf-9CkVQ

While I was there with my fiance and in-laws, we were entertained by our bubbly waitress and her ability to keep the atmosphere lighthearted with wit and slap-stick humor. The service started out great and even the guacamole was legit. It was all fun and games until the food arrived. My mother in law ordered a taco salad; the meat looked disgusting on it and surely when everyone started making tacos they started to chew a gamey sort of meat that tasted and smelled foul. We were all really disgusted and grossed out by the meat; my mother in law went into the restroom and vomited. We told the server about it and she did try to get our bill reduced, but $6.50 off the bill didn't assauge our grief, so we literally waited there for over a half hour watching their incompetent staff go through all of the motions to try and deny our request to get the item pulled off of our bill. After being firm and refusing to pay for it they succumbed to our request. At this point, everyone was in such a bad mood and although our server tried her best, we felt the food was way too overpriced to have this kind of thing to be happening.

This place is not inexpensive by any means, and for the price I was expecting top-tier Mexican food. The quesadilla I had reminded me of cafeteria food and though I ate it, I wouldn't have paid $10 for it had I known it would be mediocre at best. In addition, their margaritas were a rip off! $11 for 2 dinky margaritas which I presumed had a splash of alcohol in them at best.

The only plus is that, during off hours like mid-afternoon on a weekday, the service is reasonably paced. But still.  The food is really awful.  If you consider Taco Bell good authentic Mexican food, than you might give this place 3 stars (its still overpriced and small portions).  If you expect more quality, then its a one-star-wonder.

A couple rounds later we were wondering where our server was because he hadn't been to our table for about 30 or more minutes.  He FINALLY came by ad said his shift was ending.  She since we work in service industry we offered to close out with him and ordered another round from the new server.  We never saw our 1st server again.  We waited 20 minutes and asked where our beers were.  He said I will be right back with them...what kind of beers are you drinking again(we had a few empty bottles of the same beer on the table already).  Ordered the same beer again and waited for another 30 minutes.  Finally once we got our beers we closed out.  $95 tab..which is expected for the strip but with THAT service it should have been comped.  We then went to the bar which was a great experience.  So if you want to get decent service go to the bar......but needless to say I don't want to go back.,llSNrNPP6ob79Ft2CZfawg,3,1,1,6Ewooo4H2A8oXkOxSjxIGg

1753040,2018-06-18,0,MZRqxvBkJLjKcoOjNz7yLA,"Unfortunately my wife choose this joint based on a discount we had. Being homesick from Texas we were craving some street tacos. Jess got the Carne Asada on Flour and they seemed ok.. wait wait let me back up a bit.

We ordered drinks which were mediocre Jess a frozen margarita and I a mojito along with chips and salsa. Frozen margarita was as expected not amazing, mojito was not muttled at all, whole mint leaves etc., and light on the tequila. The salsa was fire roasted northern Cali sweet salsa style, slightly bland; chips were thick fresh and very good. Meaning they tasted like corn tortilla chips should, thick cut, not oily and the oil they were cooked in was obviously clean and not overheated or burnt. Food arrived quickly but the first thing I noticed was the ""Charlie's"" (mixed chicken, carne and Chorizo) I ordered we're on single corn tortillas. Tip: any street tacos worth eating on corn will have to be doubled to hold together because they aren't as pliable as flour. These didn't fall apart but the meat was minced, each meat was unrecognizable from the other. I thought it may all be the same and certainly all had the exact same flavor. Biggest issue was my first bit was similar to a chalky over cooked minced meat. Very over cooked. I liberally applied the hot sauce provided with the dish. It didn't help the dryness at all. I then addressed the beans and rice, mine was Charro style beans and white rice. The white rice was long grain but sticky like sushi rice and had dried out corn carrots and Lima beans in it. The chart beans were cooked well but no flavor or spice at all.  Mixed together with the hot sauce it was ok. After two bites of the bean and rice mix and two bites out of 1 of the 3 tacos I was unwilling to accept this. Jess doesn't complain and was hungry so she ate a few more bites yet confirmed my assessment. 

So Roberto our waiter was very polite and attentive, I explained the issue when he came by and he took the plate offering me a replacement, I de lined and just said I didn't want another dish if it was going to be the same quality, he apologized. The manager came through shortly later not to address my concern but to retrieve Jess's plate. I wasn't going to go any further but he saw she only ate half and being we were not typical drunk or wasted Vegas visitors his face shown of his embarrassment. I explained as I did Roberto and he replied the corporate chef was here and he had just addressed the ""dryness"" of the Charlie's tacos. He politely dismissed the rice stating it was show they served the dish, (sticky). I picked at a piece of Jess's and a large skin from the outside picked up attached. I also pointed out the dried out veggies in the rice. They should revisit the white rice. In the end we ordered a second round of drinks and Jess let Roberto know we hadn't gotten the Guacamole she ordered with her tacos. He again was very polite and said all the good was comped, I didn't request this but it's the right thing to do. I retired for a Father's Day call with Abby, Isa and Analeigh. Jess said they were very polite so if there is a saving grace I suppose it's that the managers and severs at this location are top notch with customer service. I will also say that we were maybe an hour after lunch rush and perhaps we got the scraps!?

On the downside, the quality of products and service match the price point, so it isn't much of a bargain. I've been here for both the food and the nightlife, so I'll cover both separately. 
 
 Food: Pretty mediocre bar & grille food but at a very reasonable [Vegas] price. I paid (thanks to losing card roulette) for 4 people, including a few drinks and tip, and it was right at $100. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and I don't remember anyone being overly impressed with their food. 
 
 Nightlife: We were passing by just after 1am on a Thursday and they were clearly having a party. Dark flashing lights, club music, and the place looked packed through the small window opening. The promoters out front tried to rope us in for the open bar, which lasted until 3. We wanted to go in and scope out the scene, but somehow the promoter convinced us we didn't need to do that. After a bit of price negotiation, we decided to go in around 1:30. They poured plenty of strong drinks (if you tip well), but they closed the bar at 2:30, not 3am, so we really only got 2-3 drinks for the $15 plus some obnoxious tips to get service. The place wasn't overly crowded, but they had select sections closed off so it seemed much busier than it really was. 
 
 I'd like to tell you that I won't be back, but in Vegas if you can get an edible meal and an open bar for $40 per person, you take it.",uNGpUVl1T5NaJBf5P4Il4w,2,0,2,EjozfpXX-dzZRsk9AGTYeA

If there is a law about misleading people into buying canned crushed tomatoes under the guise that they will receive salsa, then somebody at Carlos and Charlie's is in big trouble. I don't know what brand canned tomatoes we received but it wasn't good. That much I'm sure of. 

Interesting choice on the presentation of chips, btw. I don't know who came up with the paper bag, with a staple in it, placed on a plate idea but I hope they were immediately promoted cuz that is innovation!

I would like to take a second to compliment the ""chef"" on the unique ability to overcook something while still managing to serve it cold. The fries were rock solid and slightly burnt yet cold all at once. No easy feat.

The beans were, I believed also from a can, but my Mexican friend took offense to that thought because as he explained it, even canned beans wouldn't be that dry. They were old he assured me. Probably sat out all day before making their way to me. Very appetizing.

I hated the rice but one person at my table liked it. Chimichanga was pretty terrible and McDonald's most definitely makes a better hamburger.

The prices are inflated but it's Vegas so it is to be expected but when we are paying $8 for two sodas, a single refill at any point during the 30 minutes the glasses sat empty would have been a nice bone thrown our way.

I ordered the Mexican Omelette with came with salsa, chorizo, cheese, etc. I ordered the omelette without tomatoes and onions and with a side of potatoes. The waitress brought out my food and it came with beans - so i ordered a side of potatoes. I then went to eat it and realized it was loaded with tomatoes and onions. The restaurant wasn't busy, so I find this frustrating. Because at this point, they were no longer serving breakfast. 

It was okay overall and I ate most of. My friends weren't the biggest fans of their burritos, but they said it was ""okay."" They only ate half of them. It was a very expensive brunch and we ended up spending about $35 a piece with tip. This did include a $5 bloody mary which was really good. That was the highlight of the meal!

On the topic of bartenders, the younger guy and girl that were serving were very friendly and even helped me get open bar price (it was an open bar for ladies night). Service was great.

I think Groupon needs to educate their vendors on the reason why people by groupons...to save money...NOT so that we will ""get a free meal"" by not spending more then the groupon amount. 

They have a good atmosphere, almost like a college bar, its fun, loud music and people pouring shots. But the food is terrible. Cold chicken and steak, like its been sitting in the back all day (worse than then chicken cubes soaking in broth at Subway) The food was just bland, no flavor or spice. My tacos came with a ""side"" of beans. The side was a one ounce cup filled with an over salted pile of mush. Luckily I didn't get the side of rice or guacamole that was suggested, everything was $2 or more extra. Also, what Mexican restaurant makes you pay for chips and salsa!?!? 

On top of the terrible food, our server just hassled us all night about the Groupon. We spent only 38$ since the food was so bad I couldn't bring myself to try the ""delicious"" dessert suggested by the waitress who also suggested the ""amazing"" beans. Since we only spend $38 and the Groupon was for $40 the waitress made a huge deal and said we had to order more. Then she said 'well treat me right and I can get my manager to maybe over ride it.

WTF!!! Who is getting a free meal?? We BOUGHT a groupon!!!! She told us at least 5 times to tip her well because she got us a free meal.

This place doesn't have the best reviews, but thought let's give it a shot.  Took a bit to get someone to take our order and the manager was in the neighborhood, so he took the order.  

Started off with the ceviche and tortilla chips.  The ceviche is very bland and almost no flavor at all as it has tiny pieces of cod mixed in with tons of tomatoes, bits of onions and a few thin slices of avocado.   If you like bland ceviche, you will love it, if you like flavor add some Cholula or Tabasco hot sauce.  

Also ordered the fajitas and came with a tiny portion size for $20.  The steak was flavorful and tender and the chicken was good as well.  

Tried a sample of their margaritas and they were either too sweet or had too much lime.   I like a good strong margarita and these were too off the chart for me to order. Guess I'm used to the best frozen margarita in the land at Ztejas, in Costa Mesa, Ca.

One came to the table and said ""what do you want"" Uhhhh ok. Then we paid extra for the guacamole and it was not made fresh at our table. It was frozen and tasted like water. The food was way over priced even for the vegas strip. Who wants to pay $16 for a tiny gross burrito?!

A note to Raphael and the security guard: if you're trying to create an enjoyable experience, you're failing miserably. You shouldn't ever YELL at patrons, especially a female. It might make you feel tough, but this is a bar. Get a grip.

At around 11:45am it was still pretty empty so we were seated quickly and the server came over and took our drink order. He asked if he could sit down a few times which I thought was totally inappropriate seeing as he interrupted our conversation to ask. I was initially craving a taco salad of some sort but the only dressings they had to offer were Caesar and Italian. I was hoping for a more south of the border salad so I chose the chicken enchiladas (who doesn't love rice and beans and sauce!!) my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. Our server told us that he didn't like our choices and tried to push us toward other (more pricy and larger dinner entree style) options. We explained why we chose what we chose and our food was delivered to us within 5 min. I'm not usually one to be negative about quick service but 5 min seemed a little microwaved or pre-cooked and warmed up to me. Regardless we thanked them for the quick service. We the dishes were put down in front of us my friends chicken sandwich looked good. Hot, crisp but thick french fries and a juicy chicken filet. My chicken enchiladas however were topped with a red sauce that tasted like a pizza sauce or thin marinara and then melted over everything was SWIS CHEESE. WTF?!?! I had my friend taste everything just to be sure I wasn't losing my mind and sure enough....italian red sauce and swiss cheese covered my enchiladas. SO WEIRD!! Needless to say I eat much of the enchiladas and was looking forward to the rice and beans but even they were ""rice a roni"" style spanish rice and the beans weren't fresh or very good either. SO GROSS!!! 
The busier was quick to clear our plates but that was when the quickness stopped. The restaurant was no busier than when we arrived but we had to wait 45 minutes for the server to bring us the check and another 20 minutes for his to run our credit cards. He about disappeared a few times. I think it's really sad when it takes only 5 minutes from ordering our food to receiving our food and then an hour to pay the check?!

I had the enchiladas, rice and beans. Everything was extremely flavorful and in good portions. To be honest I wished there had a BIT more red sauce, but that's a minor thing.
The nachos looked great as well. As did the cheese dip. There is Happy Hour everyday from 2-6 and anytime football is on the screen. That is really the time to come. I enjoyed sitting outside and chatting with other guests around the bar. Everyone was friendly.
TIP: When you come here and there is any issue whatsoever with your food, drinks or service, ask immediately to speak with Amy.

He told me it was a mango smoothie, and since the drink was so weak, I believed him. Now I used to drink, especially when I would come down to Vegas, and I've drank in plenty of places outside of Utah, so I know I good drink. Quite possibly the drink was weak due to the fact that we all got wristbands for this place, and for a $25 cover, it was all the domestics and well drinks you wanted, with the ability to come and go as you please. I watched my friends down probably 5 of the frozen margaritas and at least 2 buds each, and neither was even slightly buzzed. I'm pretty sure that the frozen margarita mix MIGHT have a shot per serving, but the taste was good from my little but I had. 
As far as the atmosphere...eh. It definitely attracts some of the lower quality, and probably the more frugal people in Vegas, and they allow people to enter who are wearing sweats, so that should give enough of a picture of the majority of the crowd that comes in. The people dancing seemed to be enjoying themselves though! A lot of top 40, which seemed weird because it has more of a Mexican or western style feel.

The worst place EVER. HORRIBLE. TERRIBLE. RUN TO A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT. (Margaritaville if possible!!)

We ate here on a Wednesday. They are located at the Flamingo on the Las Vegas Strip. We had a Groupon. We initially contacted the restaurant on Tuesday night, at 10:30 PM and were told the restaurant closed at 2 AM, I checked their website on the Flamingo website and same thing- it was open until the ""wee hours"". PERFECT. We are STARVING!

We drive over to the Flamingo, park and walk over to the restaurant. It looks empty, except for a few individuals at the bar. We walk in and the bartender bluntly says they are closed and the kitchen is closed and cannot serve us. No ""I'm sorry"". No ""We open at xxx tomorrow and close at xxx"". NOTHING. Jerk.

Well we decide to give them a try the NEXT day. Same guy, didn't remember us, fine. Whatever. We sit down, I order a drink and my boyfriend orders a water for the mean time while he looks over the menu. They had a special, 2 Rolling Rocks for $7. Not bad- he goes with that. We chit-chat, look over the menu, chit-chat some more, give our order. My boyfriend orders Street Tacos with guacamole at a whopping $2-3 more and I order the Fish Tacos, no guar. 

Here comes our order... three street tacos and guac on a plate and three fish tacos. The Street Tacos were good, but for $15, plus the price of the guac, and NO rice or beans to accompany them, sorry! Those should be much less. Yes, I understand it IS Las Vegas, BUT geez louise- don't go all out on the price if you are not adding anything to accompany the tacos! My fish tacos were hard! VERY HARD! Was I unhappy. The breading was much bigger than the actual piece of fish.

I'll finish this off on a good note.. just kidding.. BAD NOTE! Not once did the lazy bartender ever come to see how our food was. There were two bartenders at the bar, one had about two or three groups and our bartender only had us to wait on. The other bartender was constantly making drinks for the tables, conversating with the other guests/customers. Ours was just there with a lame straight face on. So uncomfortable. 

I just wanted to leave.

Mind you- ANOTHER customer came up to the bar, talked to our bartender about her experience and the lousy service she received. He gave her a comment card, I wish I could of gotten my hands on one of those.

The biggest complaint was the price. It was over $75 for lunch for two with two drinks each. That is WAY too expensive for what we had. I started to order guacamole, but it was over $10. I'd recommend going across to the Link and having lunch at the Yard House or the Tilted Kilt.

Carlos n Charlie's is not charming. They do not have good food. They do not have good prices. The service is the turd on the top of this poop sundae; they straight up refused to let us split checks (between two parties) and scoffed at the idea of subbing a cheese enchilada for a meat enchilada on a multiple enchilada platter.

The Cadillac Margarita comes in a plastic cup and is made from swill and imitation lime swill. The guacamole shouldn't have been able to be bad (since it was made in front of us) but the guy forgot salt and pepper and hence it was immensely bland.

Sidenote: one of our party members passed out at the table immediately after consuming the above mentioned guacamole. I am 92% sure it was because she hadn't eaten all day but I want to leave open the possibility this place is poisoning it's guests because it wouldn't surprise me.

If the Paramedics or the Flamingo Security who responded to the above medical incident were Carlos n Charlie's staff this review would have more stars because their customer service was dramatically better than the actual employees.

As an alternative I recommend everywhere else in the world.

We noticed immediately that there was something weird about the table--it was huge [we couldn't touch hands with our backs against the seats, which isn't conducive to conversations], it came up to the middle of my chest, and it curved. Boyfriend thought the table was just warped, but all the booths were like that! My silverware kept sliding off my plate and into the middle of the table, so we moved. 

The food was fine. I wasn't like blown away by the burrito packed with cheese and veggies. Skip the guacamole--it's super oily. Our beers were served in giant margarita glasses, which I kinda liked. 

The service wasn't great. She didn't come by very often and we never got water. It also took quite a while to get the bill.

We were back in here an hour later because Boyfriend's group of pals showed up. This time we were seated on the patio. The nachos are ridiculously huge, which seems like something that they would point out in the menu. They're definitely meant for sharing as an appetizer and not for a single person to sit down and eat! Haha, it was a mountain of chips, real cheese, nacho cheese, and meant. The 2-for-1 margaritas were decent [strawberry was VERY strong, but I couldn't taste much alcohol in the mango so perhaps it hid the flavor]. 

Our waitress didn't come by very often and we had to go chase after her to get more drinks and our bills. When one of the guys in the group went to go talk to a manager about it, he was given an it's-not-my-problem response.

The margaritas were so mouth-twistingly bitter and sour that none of the three of us could get one down.  The next time I came they had some sort of all yo can drink thing going on.  Problem was, no one that worked there knew the rules.  We were originally sold a line about how you can come and go as much as you want and bring your drinks.  But every time they fought us about it making up rules about needing to get a new cup and then rules about having to have the same cup.

Enchilada was very delicious. Portions were very generous.

This place suuuucks. Food, service, prices, everything! The colorful, ""chaotic"" decor was what brought my friends, husband and I in on one not-yet-drunken afternoon for lack of more variety of places to eat in our hotel, and we were starving.

I immediately Yelped and was pretty terrified to eat here. I mean really, I think a restaurant actually has to work at it to get so many incredibly low ratings. Once seated we ordered one of those massive margaritas which my girlfriends shared (such a waste of money; the cup is shaped like a fatty goblet but is really hollowed out like a wine flute inside.. bye bye $$$). 

I ordered what seemed to be the safest thing on the menu - a cheese quesadilla with guacamole ($11.90 + 2.00 for guac... this thing better be gourmet!). I can't remember what everyone else ordered but they all seemed to shoot for ""safer"" options as well. My top-dollar quesadilla, which was really just a couple flour tortillas with melted shredded cheese in between, arrived with no guac. I tried to flag our waitress down but she completely ignored us after our food was delivered.

Then we tried to flag her down again for another round of waters. Ignore, ignore, ignore - we got the attention of a busboy who said he'd tell her but she still never came. 

Then they turned on that hokey cha cha slide song and tried to get everyone up, servers and patrons, to dance. Our waitress amazingly reappeared to try and drag me to dance and I kindly refused and asked, ""can I just get a water please??"" She ignored me and went to dance. I honestly could not believe her!

In the end we never got waters, I never got guac (and she attempted to charge me for it), and our waitress ""split the bill"" between me and my friends but charged some of their expensive margarita onto mine. When I pointed out the error she said I was wrong, and the bill was just fine. I was done fighting with her so we paid and left NO tip.

We went in expecting to get out money's worth and were really disappointed with the crowd. Sure, it was Thursday, but there were maybe 20 people inside. Whatever. 
We went to the bar and got decent service from a flashy bartender with a whistle who poured essentially a red solo cup full of vodka. Awesome, right?! Yeah, if you reallllllyyyy love vodka. We couldn't have finished four drinks unless we wanted to end up in the ER. So it really ended up to be a $20 cup of vodka.

My sweetie pop and I had a Groupon, and we both LOVE Mexican food, so we decided to stop by after seeing the 4pm comedy magic show with Nathan Burton. We sat out on the patio near the outdoor bar. The first thing I noticed about the menu is that this place is EXPENSIVE!

Our server--Britany--was exceptionally adorable. She seemed genuinely helpful and wanted to ensure that our meal was done correctly, but she was quite ""green"" as a server. We placed our order for an entree salad as our appetizer and our food order at the same time. By the time we had taken 3 bites from our GINORMOUS salad the food runner came out with our plates. I protested and let him know (wasn't it obvious?!) that we hadn't even begun to finish our salad . He said he would bring the food back later, and he came back not more than 5 minutes later and tried to server our plates again. Really?! Yeah, we were still eating the salad, he could see that, but he still looked bewildered as to why we didn't want our entrees at that point in time.

So, finally,  another lady brings out our food, and lo! I behold the world's smallest $15 chicken burrito! Egad, I asked for a ""wet"" burrito, and they put the sauce on the bottom of the plate. Hmm, since when did wet plate = wet burrito? I'll never know.

Sweetie Pop ate the chicken enchiladas with a combination of the red and the green sauce. Salsa verde is my favorite, but theirs isn't done well here. The red sauce was much better: spicy and delicious. I've NEVER been hungry after eating an entree sized burrito, but my tiny little chicken burrito was downright pathetic. Who puts CUBED chicken in a burrito anyway? Carlos and Charlie's does.

We were attended by a number of servers, the manager and food runners. However, when we asked the same genius (insert sarcasm here:_____________) who kept bringing our food out prematurely for some water with lemons, he proceeded to bring out one glass of water and a saucer with exactly ONE, according to Sweetie Pop,  ""sad, sorry, sucked on lemon"" on it. Britney promptly corrected his error (after all there were TWO of us, so why not bring each of us  some water and lemons?) and she apologized for the series of food service mishaps.

Ultimately, I would recommend this place for the giant nachos (I saw them on someone else's table)  and the beverages. Thursday is Ladies Night, and ladies get all you can drink frozen margaritas. Bonus! After dinner we danced to the few line dances, and had a good time before calling it a night.

Carlos and Charlie's is a place for fun, not food! Those nachos looked pretty exciting though, and as my girlfriend once told me, ""It's hard to F**K up nachos."" Too true.

p.s. Contrary to the sign on the way into the building advertising Carlos and Charlie's their happy hour has NOT been ""extended until further notice."" It only goes until 6pm...Another disappointment since we arrived at 6:04pm. *sigh*",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,3,0,2,wuF11b4NsSSjHhWW0yXz5Q

It offers overpriced, mediocre Americanized food...with a small discount if you show your Total Rewards card. Alas, the savings did not help. It was a bomb on so many levels. 

Service: our server was sweet but slow and managed to get so much wrong. I ordered a Pepsi, got a diet, and despite my almost empty glass and her eagerness to refill my husband's water at least 4 times, I never got a refill. Given that the soda was $3.50, ugh. 

She forgot to bring my soup and when we reminded her, she smiled and said she would take it off the check. Boo. 

My chicken fajita salad was tasty. Basic, no complaints. Hubby had BBQ shrimp and did not like the spicy sauce or the bacon garnish.

He was totally adorable and his accent was so cute. He was very friendly and made me feel welcome. He got me something to drink right away. My waitress was also very attentive and friendly. 

I ordered the shrimp tacos and I have to say they were very good. I can see from the other reviews that the food leaves something to be desired but in my opinion the shrimp tacos are a good choice. They were actually pretty big and had alot of flavor. I had to get a to go box because I couldn't finish all of them. I also ordered a cup of tortilla soup. That, unfortunately, was not good at all. It had no flavor and the menu said it had cheese, well where was it because I sure didn't taste any. Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and I have had it in many different places but this one was probably the worst. I will admit that the food is very pricy but at the same time Vegas restaurant prices are always inflated. 

My overall experience having lunch there was good and I will be back. 

I had another experience here at night. They had a 2 for 1 drink special going on and I just kind of wandered in at the spur of the moment. There was a group of Puerto Rican people there dancing. I went in to see what that was about and next thing I know they are pulling over to them to dance with them. I ended up with a margarita in each hand and dancing with these people all night. I had a blast. They kept the drinking coming and the music going. If you come with some fun people this place can be a fun place to party at.

-chips/salsa and guacamole took a long time to bring out - have to pay for chips/salsa (not included) 
-More pricey than most places 
-Not conveniently located if you are driving to the Flamingo - parking there sucks and walking to restaurant is further 

If you are looking for more of a bar atmosphere before going out and getting some drinks maybe even chips/salsa, this may be a good place.  

4 people with 2 year old = $100/dinner price (did not include drinks)

-side of veggies

The service was far from great. 
The food was mediocre at best. 
The salad wasn't fresh (found a limpy brown piece). 
They weren't busy at all yet they failed to send someone to our table to make the guacamole as described in the menu.
The BBQ chicken was served cold; when told the chicken was cold, they merely heated up the same piece. (My food [chimichanga] was also not so hot, but instead of telling them I just stopped eating because it wasn't that good anyway)
Oh, and one of the plates were dirty.

My hunni was immensely disappointed :(
We felt a bit deceived because the hostess that showed us to our table was nice and friendly but I guess customer service doesn't reflect the quality of food.
All in all, $60 at Carlos & Charlies = a crappy meal.  We had to make up for it by eating a wonderful dinner, so we went to Olives, at the Bellagio, which was delish! Review coming soon :)",mqCzdhfZck4d8ggQuWMpiQ,5,1,1,0NBHOUyxP1XD0OITfUstGg

Server Chris

We came in a day after Cinco de Mayo.

Although we have walked past here dozens of times on our past trips we never ate here.
We love reading Yelp reviews and everyone's experience can be different. 

My wife has been to the Carlos N Charlies at Acapulco, but she wasn't expecting the same results as she is from there :)

I first presented my coupon which they said no problem and took our order.
I opted for the 20 oz Cadillac margarita. This had a great flavor and left me with a slight buzz.

My wife had a virgin Pina colada, not sure if this was machine made or just a perfect blended result.  

She opted for the Mole Enchiladas and I had the carna asada tacos. 

The carna asada tacos had a lot of meat on them. More than the photos from CNC. I liked the flavor and they were very filling. They were better than I was expecting.

My wife said the mole was very good. Mole is a serious business to her :) She liked the enchiladas as well. But said the mole made the meal. The prices were on point with what other Mexican places on the strip charge. Just have to be used to the Strip prices :)

The waiter was nice and let us know this is also a club at night. We may go back for the club in July! Thanks for having us!",kpZNOAe-A3f8t8RTOjOs0w,5,1,4,WRYSUhTcbEF8alUtQyXcmQ

I echo everyone's sentiments that this is one of the worst dining choices you could ever make. This place is so horrible it needs to be called out.

I dined there on 11/12/2012. I was with a some people and we just wanted to take a break from gambling and get a bite to eat and some drinks before heading to another casino. Huge mistake.

While we were seated right away and the waitress took our drink orders, we didn't see our drinks (or our waitress) for a good twenty minutes. Eventually, some guy showed up (who was not our server) to take our dinner orders. 

I should also mention the atmosphere. If you're planning to eat in the dining section, don't plan on talking to anyone around you. The music is blaring and you'll have to shout at each other. I've also never seen a group of wait staff pretending to have so much fun. I almost felt sad for them. And the kicker was when they started offer free tequila shots at the bar with a bartender pretending to be Tom Cruise in Cocktail. I've never seen a bar/restaurant try so hard and so epically fail.

As for the food, save your money (and most importantly your time) and go to Taco Bell. It's actually much, much better. And I eat at Taco Bell maybe once a year. I got the carne asada tacos which were the blandest thing ever. I heaped every condiment I could find on them and they were still awful. I thought about ordering the special guacamole appetizer which is made at your table but decided against it. Thank god.

After you've eaten, prepare to spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for the check. We actually had to get up to find our waitress and request it. She smiled, laughed, flipped her hair, and said ""Sure, I'll be right back."" She did show up and take the credit card but apparently duty called elsewhere. She had to prepare the ""special guacamole appetizer"" for another table. Apparently the ""special recipe"" is something they share with their wait staff and make them do it. Another fifteen minutes go by and we're starting to wonder what she did with the credit card. We had to flag down another wait person to ask if our waitress was coming back.

Eventually, she showed up. She was all happy and perky. And oblivious. Much like this restaurant.",2JD9cjG4AHDUnoGzcQFTrQ,0,0,1,8xTtRXGsiCTEEoEjipVmBg

How a Mexican restaurant doesn't have veggie fajitas or bean burritos or the like is beyond me.  They did have a great ensalada with apples, goat cheese, and walnuts but that doesn't scream Mexican to me.  In any case, it was good enough to eat twice.  The appetizer nachos were decent as was the tableside guac.  Both times we ate here everyone liked what they ordered.  They have 2 for 1 margaritas during happy hour as well as half price Smirmoff martinis for Thursday ladies night.  The ambiance is fun and the servers are upbeat and friendly when you can find them.  Expect a long wait for drinks, food, refills, the bill....  Prices are a little high but you can expect that seeing as it's Vegas.  You do save a little if you are a Total Rewards member.

     I ordered chips and salsa along with fish tacos.  The chip came in a To Go bag and it was a plentiful lot of chips... warm.  The salsa was mediocre but a large portion.  I liked the idea of a bag of chips as people visiting Vegas always need some snacks for later, in their room.
     The fish tacos came out quickly to be expected given the small number of people there.  There were three and each was loaded with a healthy amount of what I would call chipotle coleslaw and breaded fish.  I think I wanted more fish but as I ate my way through the first two tacos I realized I was eating some pretty good food.  The tacos came with three small bowls each having a sauce (hot oily sauce, ranch and tartar sauce).  I dipped into all three throughout my meal and liked the oily hot sauce best).  My drink order was club soda with lime - no way that gets screwed up.
     So what can I say but give an A-OK rating.  The food was served hot, tasty, quick and I had the place all to myself.
