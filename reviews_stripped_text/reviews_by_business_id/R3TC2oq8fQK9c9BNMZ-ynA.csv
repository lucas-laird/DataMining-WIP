The dirty dishes were piled on the table, no one got more water since the first time, my beer took forever to come and food that we order never came in, including soft drinks. Now, based on the service I have revived in the past, I will not judge this place for a one bad time.

I give this place an A+ for presentation, however for taste all they get is five thumbs down! I would have rather chewed on cock roaches rolled up into seaweed and washed it down wit piss and even that would taste better that what i ate. The service was ok, nothing special though. Prices for the amount of food received was totally not worth it either. Apparently they have a great happy hour for drinks,and because of that I recommend that they remodel their business into a bar, because I've ate better sushi purchased from the grocery store that sat out all day. Save your money if you have working and functional taste buds. If you love the taste of dirt. Then this is the perfect place for you. Oh I visited place Monday Feb 7th around the happy hour time. I'm thinking maybe it's that the chef was drunk from happy hour why my food wasn't the best",uqClOaTJDTlwrajeuZPMOA,0,0,1,ZZA502XMIdlwHF3gBgjaMA

The RA Sushi in Las Vegas was the absolute worst! We didn't go there looking for a 5 star sushi experience, but we went expecting what we get at the other RAs. We had just flown in earlier that day, so we just played dinner by ear. When we got there, it was around 8:30ish. So not busy at all. Plenty of tables. (Should have been a sign) after we were seated it took 10 mins just to get our drink order. We asked our server what kind of tequilas they had. She replied, no one drinks tequila so I don't know. Do you want me to check? We should have left then. 

My husband and I settled for water. While we waited for the ""real"" server to come and take our order, my husband and I couldn't even have a conversation because the club music was super loud! Ok, I'm not one of those, no loud music people. If there would have been a lot of people in there to absorb the sound it wouldn't have been so bad, but when our server finally came she couldn't hear us either. 

So it was the first part if Feb. and they had just started a Red promotion, with a new roll and a new cocktail. Our server new NOTHING ABOUT IT, even though it was right there in the front of the menu. 

So after 30 mins, we got our 2 rolls and tuna tartar. I asked for more wasabi and sarrachi  sauce, never got either. Never got a refill of our waters. We looked around the restaurant and everyone pretty much had the same look of disappointment. 

So, it comes time to get our bill and tab out. That took another 30min!  We were so disappointed and annoyed, I wanted to wait to write this review. But I can see, the time passing hasn't changed my opinion or made me soften up on them.",l4qMci-Agu3HsJvSkzgN0g,1,0,1,3EN-TSO1CXSEp6f_0b0lQw

Let me put it this way I went here for lunch with my mother at 1:30 and I came back at 5 with the rest of my family for more. 

I had the spicy miso soup which is a very large serving- it can feed like 4 people. IT was flavor full and filled with all the veggies and goodies that I love

I also had the Calamari and omg this calamari was so soft and tender that it felt like you were eating jello. But don't get me wrong the batter was still so crispy that it was so addictive. 

I also enjoyed the crispy onion albacore, it was so delicious that the second time we went we order three plates! 

The Tropical roll was to die for! So basically it had cucumber, mango and avocado rolled onto some spinach tempura bits. But the thing that made it amazing was the mango salsa that they threw on top of it all that gave it a refreshing and unique flavor. 

The Viva Las Vegas is something that you should enjoy...well when you are in Vegas! So so tasty, there is just so much in it and so much going on the flavors are like a punch to the mouth! 

For dessert we had something like a banana split roll, it was like a egg roll with a banana in it sliced up like sushi. Then it had strawberries and chocolate drizzled on top. It was the perfect way to end the meal. 

Stop by for happy hour because it's well worth the trip!

167960,2016-03-31,0,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"Great value on the Vegas strip! After enduring some ridiculously overpriced, mediocre meals during our visit to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, we were happy to find a place with excellent food and prices more reasonable than back home (suburban Washington DC). 

The husband and I started off with a bang with bottles of sake for $4-which is incredibly reasonable- while kids had strawberry lemonade served all fancy with kosher salt on the glass rims. 

The special rolls- seasonal, dragon, and Gojira, had standout flavors and were large enough to be a stand-alone meal for some (though not for my teens or husband lol). My chirashi bowl was just right- neatly cut pieces of fish, cucumber, and avocado, and a tasty yet not overpowering sauce, served over perfectly cooked and seasoned rice. It was a very generous portion-equivalent to several large rolls- for only the price of a specialty roll. My only criticism is that the menu stated it was supposed to be served with soup, which it was not. I did not complain however, because as it was I was so full (as was everyone else in my family) I couldn't quite finish the bowl so the soup would have went to waste.

The service was friendly and they frequently refilled our waters and cleared dishes which is a big plus in my book.

Too bad they won't be open tomorrow morning, so we will probably be spending the same amount of money as tonight's dinner on a way-overpriced hotel breakfast.",aaWZ2eqaddsv8gvUePMzHA,0,0,5,DyTuglb3M8lpShywZRldHg

One of the best places to have sushi on the strip.The last three times I've been to Vegas, we ordered the entire Happy Hour menu, which is about 15-18 items, all for roughly $45!!!! Be sure you have plenty of people to share it with, I suggest about 4 people! Imagine, $10 per person for an assortment of sushi and other Japanese dishes!! You cannot find good quality food at this price that will leave you satisfied in Vegas anywhere!! My favorites are the Coconut Shrimp Tempura and the Scallop Dynamite!! YUMMM!!!

The party never stops in Vegas,  so expect loud music spun by an in house DJ (of course with a pre-made set), plasma screen tv's and a full bar!! Great atmosphere for the non-stop party animals!! 

Happy Hour prices are also available for sake and beer, just $6 for both. 

This place can get a bit crowded around 8PM, so anticipate a long wait, or try to come early, or even try to come in late after the ideal dinner time.

Food: 1/5
Service: -1/5
Management: 4/5

Never have I complained to a restaurant manager before, but the service my friends and I received here was so sub-par, we had to speak up.

6 of us came here for a late lunch at the recommendation of a friend. It was our last day in Vegas, and we let our server know that we had to be at the airport in about 3 hours. She said it wasn't a problem. And then it all went downhill from there. How so?

- despite telling her our time constraints, it took her over half an hour to come take our food orders (the restaurant was half full)
- plus almost an hour and a half for our food to actually reach our table
- everyone's food (w/ the exception of my friend who ordered sushi) was overcooked and oversalted and generally not enjoyable

The kicker:
- she brought the wrong dish for one of my friends, yet wouldn't apologize or admit to her mistake!!!!! She didn't offer to make it right or anything. When we told her, she said ""oh, okay"" and walked away.

Knowing how long our food took, we didn't have time to send the wrong dish back because we wouldn't get to the airport in time. So my friend just ended up eating whatever the server brought him.

After bringing our food orders, this server avoided our table like the plague. We couldn't find her for drink refills or even the bill when we wanted to leave. I've never had such bad service in my life! Eventually, we had the hostess locate the manager for us so we could make an official complaint. He was apologetic and ended up comping our food for us, which was unexpected but kind of him. If only he had been more on top of his servers from the get go!

Never again. There are too many other restaurants on the Strip to subject myself to this crappy level of service again.

430294,2010-12-22,3,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"In town for my son's graduation & we were looking for a place to have lunch, close to our hotel. My son & his gf recommended this place, so we walked over to nearby Fashion Show mall.

From the moment you walk in, the fiery red glow of lanterns overhead & the upbeat music pumping throughout this trendy restaurant, will put you in a head-swingin', appetizing mood for some ""RA""ckin' great food.

Our friendly & attentive server greeted us & quickly took our drink orders. If you're not sure what's good here, no worries, just look for the red dots on the extensive menu indicating customers' favorites.

Most of us got Lunch Special (11am - 3pm) Bento Boxes (served w/ miso soup, uchi no salad, rice, gyoza & a veggie spring roll) -  Shrimp Tempura $8.50 & Chicken Katsu $8.50. I didn't try any of these, but everyone said they really liked it. The Katsu sauce was served with some spicy mustard swirled in it, different, but still good though. Other Bento Boxes on the menu - Veggie Tempura, Chicken Teriyaki, Beef Teriyaki & Salmon Teriyaki ($7.50-8.50).

My son's gf got one of the Lunch Special Bowls (served w/ miso soup) - Bara Chirashi Bowl (poke-style tuna, salmon, hamachi, shrimp, avocado & cucumber with Asian greens on rice) $10. Again, I didn't have this, but she said it was really good. Other bowls on the menu - Spicy Salmon, Spicy Tuna, Beef Teriyaki & Chicken Teriyaki ($8.25-10).

For starters we got the ""RA""ckin' Shrimp $10.25. This app was totally ""RA""ckin'! A dozen crispy (fried-chicken style), super-crunchy seasoned large pieces of shrimp served on greens with an amazing creamy ginger-teriyaki dipping sauce. The rest of the app menu looked just as incredible -  Blue Claw Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Crispy Soft Shell Crab & Scallop Dynamite are just some of the dozen+ apps on the menu ($7.25-10.25).

As for my order? C'mon, we're in Vegas, live a little! So I order, from the signature menu , ""Viva Las Vegas Roll"" $13.25. Five unreal-crab (aka imitation-crab) & cream cheese sushi rolls, tempura battered, crispy fried, topped with a spicy tuna & crab mix then crowned with a crispy fried wafer of lotus root, all on a platter drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The flavors of the cream cheese, spicy tuna-crab mix & sweet sauce, the creamy & crunchy textures, combined with the Vegas style presentation, make this thing - simply ""RA""mazing!

All of our orders were brought to our table swiftly, team-effort style & my Sapporo (although took a bit longer) made a dramatic entrance, hand delivered by one of the bar staff - awesome.

In the Fashion Show Mall or nearby & looking for a place to eat? Skip the food court & head to this Strip-level restaurant. No question, this will be on our ""must-eat"" for the next trip. There's something for everyone on the menu, including soups, salads, noodles, a full sushi bar & cocktail bar. Prices are decent, food is great, atmosphere is bumpin' & the service is excellent (as it turns out, our server's a North Shore homegirl) Props to our server ""Raina"" & team RA, br-""RA""-ah!

446313,2014-06-26,0,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"Mainly I order platters from this restaurant, but I've eaten here as well.

Ordering is a breeze. Look up the choices online, place a call at least 24 hours ahead, and schedule a time to pick it up.

 I don't like going to the bar to pick up my order. The female bartender there ignored me for a group of sweaty, red faced men grouped at the back of the bar and I mean even AFTER they got their drinks. There was no one else there except for me! When she finally addressed me, she was rather stern and to the point. I tipped the person who walked out with my tray directly. Forget the uptight witch behind the counter...

The sushi on the to-go platter seems to be pretty fresh, but don't expect AYCE sushi quality. It's probably been made early in the morning and is somewhat dry and very firm by the time you pick it up.

If you plan on coming here for a date, you might want to re-think it solely based on the fact that its very LOUD. Like Nightclub loud. If you don't mind eating and yelling at your date, then go right ahead, the food is decent enough. 

The spicy miso is nasty. I loooove miso soup, but the spicy miso tastes like regular miso soup with Frank's Red Hot splashed in the broth... and that's it. It takes away from the rich, full, flavor of a good miso soup and replaces it with a cheap vinegar-y taste.

Parking can be horrendous if you plan on parking underneath the mall in the parking garage. It took me over an hour to find parking one summer. Other times I've driven straight to the elevator area and walked right in.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,1,0,3,pzPlx2Di2dN3BWgYfxMV_Q

I was back in town again this week and gave RA another try for dinner with a group of 5.  First  of all, it is WAY too loud in there.  The music is turned up so high, we had to scream at each other just to have a conversation.  As soon as we sat down, they turned the lights down so low we could not read the menus.  Luckily, we are A/V techs working in town and we all had our flashlights handy.   You would think seeing a table full of flashlights would clue them in to turn the lights up again, but no such luck.

We had already been waiting quite a while when our waitress came and asked us if we would mind waiting some more so she could finish with another table.  When she finally got our table going, our beers were served warm (it was 110 degrees outside) and we had to ask for glasses for them.  When she took the food order, she couldn't hear one end of the table. After shouting back and forth with bad results, we had to suggest she come around to the other end of the table so she could hear us better.  The worst part came when the entire group had been served, except for one of us.  When we inquired about this she said - and this is verbatim - 'If we waited to bring it out until it was all ready, the fish would go bad'.  We also received our appetizer AFTER we had finished our meal, with no apology or explanation. 

If the food was amazing I would say putting up with all this was tolerable, but it just isn't.  The servings are skimpy and there is more rice than anything else in most rolls.  Their specialty rolls are not even served with wasabi or ginger.  The failed mexi-japanese fusion menu is more flash than fish.  

I sincerely hope the owners and management have more experience expediting a kitchen than our experience indicated, or that the waitress seemed to be aware of.

Went for the Happy Hour and ordered a nice assortment of food and some drinks.  The waiter then asks me and my wife to provide him with identification.  I ask why I need to identify myself to dine here, and he states that it is restaurant policy of identify every person who orders alcohol.  Now I am over 50 and maybe could pass for 45 on a good day, but surely could not be misunderstood to be a 20 year old.  My wife is a bit younger, but also not looking within a decade and a half of a 20 year old. 

So, this business cannot make a decision that happens around 5 million times a day elsewhere across America, where someone makes a sensible decision on whether someone is old enough to legally have a drink.  You know, if you choose to be absolutely silly, then I will just take my money elsewhere.

So finally Im done eating they gave me the check again Im sitting there forever just waiting for my server to get my check I tried to get the other server attention but they keep ignoring me.

The downsides though; 
The restaurant, like most of Vegas, had a sort of club like feel to it where as the music was very loud for such a small place.

They have a good happy hour menu from 4-7 with really inexpensive rolls, drinks and apps. I really enjoyed the lobster shrimp roll with asian pesto. The pesto really gave it a different flavor that I quite enjoyed. The wasabi mashed potatoes were also to my liking. I didn't actually have any bad food.

It took 20 minutes for water, 20 minutes for drinks, 20 minutes before she took our order. dishes came out sporatically and some took 45 minutes to get. Below are the dishes I personally ordered and tasted.  

We ordered 
Chilli Ponzu yellow tail roll - the sauce was awful, it was literally just hot sauce no intricate flavors.

Hot Mess - the rice was over cooked to the point it felt like you were chewing on a rock. And they did not use King crab more like Fake KING KRAB.

Pork Gyoza - Normally my daughter and I can't stop eating these, but these had no flavor we left half on the plate.

Ra chips and salsa - I have no idea what they were thinking. They covered the sushi with a overly sweet and sticky sauce that destroyed the fish flavor. I took 3 bites trying to like them but left the rest.

Garlic Edamame was the only decent edible food.

Then I ordered a teriyaki chicken for my daughter because she flat out refused to eat her favorite Gyoza. Asked them to please omit the teriyaki sauce just bring the cooked chicken. What we got was disgusting. It was covered in oil and all I can assume is black flakes all over it, reminiscent of grease leavings in an oil fryer. I have no clue I don't even care, at this point I was done with this place.  

And the cherry on top..... my husband got food poisoning and was sick for days. 

It's pretty safe to say we will be telling all our friends to avoid this place at all costs. We really should have known better considering the place only had 4 tables and every other restaurant by it was packed with a 2 hour wait time.",7PMfXTakD_y3qRmUczbOZQ,1,0,1,ivO9inn56htj0tnQ-P-Gkw

Yet, it was readily apparent that the manager was far too interested in a certain football game to change the channel. (It was also apparent that no one else was watching TV in the joint - the place was empty.) Upon a second request, the manager changed the channel of the second TV which was farther away from our table and obstructed. I am perfectly fine with not getting a TV changed if another customer requested something else before me.

Fast forward to 2012 and I finally get the chance to go back to RA. The service was about the same and so was the food. Unfortunately, they discontinued the Ginger Strawberry Lemonade, but everything was just like I remembered it so I was satisfied and planned to come back. 

Now, in 2015, I won't go back to RA. The service has become AWFUL. I've had to wait over 30 minutes for my waiter to take my drink order. Their staff isn't attentive at all and their food has dipped in quality too. Don't get me wrong, their speciality item, the Las Vegas Roll, is freakin' delcious, but the cons of this place spoil the sacredness of that special, little menu item. 

It's unfortunate but true. RA, please get your act together! You were once a great place and I miss being a regular. I'd love to grace you with my money once more, but until you can get your staff some training, I can't come back. I'm sorry.",VFtQI1mODorJr_mHIglsCA,0,0,2,-xi9fFpKe9zFVoPXUXJ0cQ

I doubt I will come here on any other night cause I'm afraid any other night would just get me disappointed and I certainly don't want to ruin my expectations from this spot.  

Not sure if the items below or prices are still accurate but it is what it was when I went about a year ago.  And it was KICK ASS!!!  Honestly, I would come to Vegas just for this.  But only available on Sundays so if you are in just for the weekend, maybe stay an extra day or two so you can try Ra on Sunday Nights....  

Alot of Variety.  Most places only give a couple items for specials but Ra definitely hooks it up....

So their Specials for Sunday Nights are as follows:

Food Specials from 8p - 12 midnight:
Edamame $1.50
Flying Fish Eggs $2.50
Flying Fish Roll $5.00
Salmon Nigiri $2.50
California Roll $3.00

The food at RA never wows me. I ordered the New Zealand Roll and it was interesting! Cream Cheese, Tuna, Scallops, Kiwi, Mangoes, or something like that. It was definitely interesting. The bf didn't enjoy this too much because it was too weird for him but I did! I like weird things.

The red lights in RA make me feel REALLY sleepy so definitely ask for their tea to keep you awake. Our server was pretty attentive to us and nice.

Once we walked in, I immediately loved the atmosphere. All the hanging red orbs brightened up the otherwise dark room.

The hostess was very inviting and made us feel right at home. My girlfriend and I ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, which is alright. I wasn't much of a fan of the crispy piece on top due to that fact that it got stuck on in my teeth and didn't add any flavor. On the other hand, we also ordered the crispy onion albacore which was delicious. I also really like how they plate their food. The presentation was beautiful and makes me not want to eat it and instead, frame it on my wall. The happy hour wasn't that great and prices for some rolls were pretty up there, especially for the Viva Las Vegas roll which didn't do anything for me.

Sadly for my friend, he was duped by the server that took care of us. When asking what we good, the server insisted that the Asian crispy tacos were amazing and would highly recommend it. Keep in mind my friend eats anything and everything...even cheap Uni from Kula sushi.  When he got his order, he absolutely hated it. I'm not sure if it was just him but for a recommendation, I would expect the server to offer an item to appeal to everyone.

Reverse happy hour runs from 10-close during the week. There were dozens of drinks and food options on the menu, ranging from $2.75-7.75 per item. We had some pretty standard rolls (spicy salmon, shrimp, yellowtail). They weren't anything mind blowing, but hit the spot and were decently priced. The yakitori chicken came with three skewers; the teriyaki sauce was bland, and the meat was a little tough. Same for the seared ahi tapas.

-beer (Kirin Light)

-seaweed salad
-cucumber salad
-edamame

I thought this was really strange but wasn't an issue. Good find in Vegas for our sushi fix. Oh they're also open late night post clubbing!",6-rqghxrNpXJ3RIMGz3xoQ,0,0,4,-mwLo-pKiC_FNh15Gvt1OQ

It was our first time going to Las Vegas last week and on the first night there we were craving something Asian so we yelped that and up popped this awesome sushi bar. It's a mix of regular Japanese rolls and some Asian Fusion appetizers/side dishes. It was the best decision ever! So good, in fact, that we decided to go there twice in our three day stay in Vegas. Located right on The Strip at the Fashion Show Mall, it was so easy to find. The greatest thing about this place was its happy hour is from 3-7pm, perfect for dinner time. From $2 side dishes, to $4 regular rolls and $7 dollar special rolls, $30 was enough to fill our tummies with delicious yummy-ness. I also personally loved the atmosphere, its red lights and tasteful decorations plus top 40 music playing in the background, complements the Vegas style perfectly. I just can't express enough how awesome this place was, when I go back with my friends in the summer, I am definitely bringing them there!!

Some must tries at this restaurant are: shishito peppers, Viva Las Vegas Roll, spicy tuna roll, garlic sugar snow pea, tootsi roll, and scallop dynamite, 5/6 of them were on the wonderful happy hour menu!",CAHkxcpLYErUTwwmaVlOTQ,1,1,5,pnnJ0TJ0RjnPFWvBp8ITeA

It's right across the street from work, and the happy hour (4p-7p) here is ridiculous. You get a Sake Bomber for $7. Two of those and you'll be in great shape to hit up the clubs that are within walking distance. A perfect spot to pre-game.

They have several appetizers on the menu during HH, in addition to some of the sushi rolls.

It's not the best sushi ever, but it does the job.

I've only been here on Friday nights, but around 6PM, they have an in-house DJ that isn't afraid to play some dub step, house and whatnot.

This is THE spot for happy hour if you are in the area.

Service: The service was great, we had a girl named Ashley who was a sweetheart and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu, answering the questions we had about the menu. 

Food: I had the nutty grilled chicken salad, which I really enjoyed! It had edamame in it which I really like in my salads. My dad had the sushi dinner platter, which I had some of as well. It definitely wasn't the best sushi we've had, but it was okay. My mom is not a fan of sushi, so she had the teriyaki chicken bowl and she also ordered vegetable tempura, which was not overly battered and oily, so that was great! To drink, I decided to try the iced green tea but had to have it taken back because it was intolerable. It tasted like seaweed, honestly. That's what my dad said, I thought it was hilarious, and I agreed.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is quite  trendy, it's pretty dark inside too. The one thing that stands out the most about this place is that it's super LOUD. Don't come here if you want to chat with whoever you're with.

The server warned me that the sushi bar was backed up and my order might take a while. Fair enough, I wasn't in a hurry.
The dynamite roll arrived within 5 minutes, awesomely quick, and it was delicious. By the time I was finished with my dynamite roll I still haven't received water or my sake. I flagged down the server, who finally brought me some water.
After about 30 minutes the first 2 pieces of nigiri (salmon) arrived, but without wasabi. The salmon was not the freshest. After about another 10 minutes, the second order of nigiri arrived (eel) and by that time I also got my sake. The eel was good.
Summary:
- service was unsatisfactory. It wasn't the long wait for my food, but the fact that I repeatedly had to flag down my server to get my stuff
- raw fish was not fresh
- cooked items were good
- prices are good

Back in the day (like 10 years ago) when I worked at the mall,  my girls and I would frequent this joint and get wasted on mango hot sake and viva Las Vegas rolls.  Fast forward to now,  in a sushi reunion,  I'm back on the Ra bandwagon! Not much has changed,  except for some great menu additions,  and less of a Club vibe (no more dj both). 

What you get at Ra that you can't get at the 1000 other amazing sushi places in town is a super cool vibe,  sexy lounge like restaurant atmosphere,  a full bar with innovative cocktails and full beer list, and really good sushi for a great price.  It's like the best mix of local meets strip.  Perfect for date night.  Perfect for meeting the girls.  Just perfect.  

It's located on the outside of Fashionshow Mall on the Las Vegas Blvd side in between kona grill and el Segundo. They're open late and also do an amazing lunch special.  I love coming here for lunch and getting a bento box,  or for happy hour cocktails and some sushi dinner.  

The staff is amazing.  The bartender Adam is funny and great at slangin' drinks.  My server Jorge was so attentive and made our experience great! The GM of the restaurant Ken even came out and checked on our table.  Such a good time and amazing food.

I used to frequent this location several times a week when I worked at the Wynn and enjoyed it for many years. Tonight's dinner doesn't inspire me to come back.

RA feels more like a fusion restaurant than anything traditional. In addition to sushi that most people are familiar with, RA also adds twists to many of their rolls. Their famous Viva Las Vegas Roll is great, plated very well, and is part of the Happy Hour menu! The menu is quite unique, and you will not be able to find most of the items on their menu anywhere else (sans the traditional rolls).

Happy Hour is half off select appetizers and rolls, while certain drinks are marked at a set lower price. This is one of the best selling points, but I noticed that it is also one of their caveats. While I was not disappointed during regular hours, I ordered the same roll during Happy Hour, and the roll just didn't seem up to par as during regular hours. I guess they have to meet up with increased demand? Regardless, this doesn't bother me, as the quality is still far above anything else I have tried.

1912653,2008-04-19,1,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"The horror... the horror... the horror. This is anything but Japanese food. The food here is about as authentic Japanese as Mexican General Pancho Villa was an authentic Soviet astronaut. 

Making great sushi is indeed an art, so it would seem like a no-brainer to make something like a chicken teriyaki. That is until you come to RA. Not only was the chicken dry, the rice was soggy - yes, SOGGY - the bok choi was overcooked, the mushrooms were undercooked, and the ""sauce"" was watery. It was horrible. I couldn't even finish half of this dish. 

And if it was just my dish that was bad, then I'd be forgiving. But it wasn't. My girlfriend's dish was terrible, too. She didn't finish hers either. The best thing on her chicken salad was the avacado, and that was good only because all they had to do was slice it and put it on the plate. She also had some sushi, and complained that it wasn't very good.

Service was terrible. The hostess was friendly enough, but the wait staff was awfully slow. We waited for almost 10 minutes while they ""cleared"" a table that was already clear... couldn't she have helped the wait staff out, or was it really that important for her to change the candles on the decor in the lobby at 3pm in the afternoon? When the bill came, our waitress didn't even bother coming back to the table to get my card - we had to take the bill to the hostess. Not the waitress, the hostess. That's terrible service. They got no tip.

Anybody that thinks this is good food is obviously out of their mind, and has absolutely no comparison to good, authentic Japanese food. It's just crap here. The decor is nice, the location is nice, the people watching is nice. But if it doesn't come in a sealed bottle, don't order it, because it's going to be crap.

I really like the ambiance and feel of the restaurant.
Dark lighting inside with lots of cool hanging red orbs.

They had a live dj. The music was really good and on point. 

They had plentiful of seating inside and outside.
The outdoor seating has light water spraying everywhere to keep you cool.
But I was thinking.... wouldn't the water get all over the food and drinks?
We got a table inside anyways and it was nice.

Some of the sushi rolls are good, and most of them are just ok.
The sushi rolls range from $10-$17.

Here are all the sushi rolls we ordered with the prices:
Lobster Salmon Roll $13.45
RA Lollipop 15.25
Crazy Monkey Roll 10.25
Scallop Dynamite Roll 13
Mango Lobster Roll 11.25
RA'cking Roll 13.25
Soft Shell Crab Roll 12.25

My number one favorites were the scallop dynamite roll, RA'cking roll and the crazy monkey roll!!! Their Garlic Edamame ($5.30) was amazing too.

I also really enjoyed the Umami punch bowl for $18.
It wasn't that strong though, just more fruity. but still delicious.

We went ahead and made a reservation for RA one night because it was close to our hotel. We were greeted by several hostesses and by the manager when we walked in. A little before 7, it wasn't crowded at all which was great. Our server was super friendly and engaging. 

The food was really good. Highly recommend the Viva Las Vegas roll like other users have. We also had a Rainbow Roll and some Yellowtail Sashimi...all of which were great. RA is a moderately upscale sushi chain so their prices aren't too high but they're also not as low as your local neighborhood sushi place might be.

It's not really place I would recommend going to if you want to sit down and catch up with people. At the risk of aging myself...the music is pretty loud and it's hard to hear. It has a very cool, modern vibe though. It would be a great place to sit in the bar and have a few drinks and rolls at, and they do have happy hour!

Definitely recommend making a reservation (you can use OpenTable) if you're going on a weekend or during the holidays like we did. By the time we left (around 8), the place was totally full, so it definitely gets busy.",Fop_SK3pFemDf-RtaS5JQQ,0,0,4,YP20A-CNwiWfMwefTE7_Mg

They have a really extensive menu and we were pretty surprised to see that everything was reasonably priced. I ordered the Dinner Sashimi Assortment which had four pieces of tuna, salmon, yellowtail and whitefish; served with a bowl of rice and Miso soup. It was under 20 dollars which is definitely worth it. 

However, one of the pieces of whitefish had a small bone in it which took me by surprise. You don't expect to bite on something hard when eating something with melt-in-yo-mouth texture. I wasn't going to say anything about it but later on in the meal, I discovered two much bigger bones, one in a yellowtail and another in the whitefish.

3 stars for what it is! It's good but not super memorable. It's the kind of food that you eat to sustain life but with a hint to enjoy it's texture.

Service/Waiting-- 3/5
There is hardly a wait for happy hour which is always a plus! You can basically walk off the street and ask the hostess for a table.

Well drinks are $3, specialty drinks $4.  There's a happy hour menu which has some rolls and some other appetizers that are all half off.  

For food, we shared a crispy spicy tuna roll, a viva las vegas roll, the scallop dynamite (appetizer, not roll), and crab cakes.  This came out to $20 which is quite a deal if I don't say so myself!  The crab cakes were great - there's 3 so it was good for sharing.  Crispy Spicy Tuna is sort of strange; it comes on these sesame rice balls that are quite glutinous.  The scallop dynamite is this baked, sizzling hot plate with some mushrooms and creamy sauce.  Good!    

Nigiri is also half off (maybe only some kinds), so we tried the salmon and tuna ones.  Two pieces of nigiri for 2.50, not bad.

This patio area remains quite cool even in the summer and provides an amazing opportunity for people watching.  The view from the patio seating at RA looks directly across the Strip at Wynn.  The music is a bit of a mystery, as RA is located directly beside a mexican restaurant that plays appropriate to theme music that competes with the fresh sounds provided by RA.

The staff was a mediocre.  They are knowledgeable about their menu, but they aren't exactly going to go out of their way to make sure that you do.  If you are lucky you might get someone to smile in your general direction.

We arrived at 10:05 PM tonight and were seated. Then, we saw that happy hour was from 10PM onwards on the weekdays. We ordered a Rainbow Roll from the HH menu (8.99 instead of 11.95), and two other rolls from the regular menu.

We were served by ROB. At first he seemed Ok. We were honestly just making small talk and joking with him throughout. Our order took 30 mins to arrive, which was fine despite it being a slow night with little customers. Sushi was ok as well; it was on the salty side. 

When the bill came out, we were charged full price for the Rainbow Roll. We placed our credit card to pay; and asked a woman (bartender?) working there to let our waiter know to adjust our rainbow roll to the HH price.

He came out with the bill having charged us 11.95. No questions asked. I came up to talk to him, let him know the situation. I asked him why he charged us full price when it was HH? He responded, ""I don't know why you're doubting/questioning me *insert him scoffing*. I can't do anything about it now.  I can get my manager but it'll take a while cus he's busy."" I'm 1000% sure it was HH when I arrived because I SPECIFICALLY looked at the HH menu, and then at my watch to show 10:05 before exclaiming to my cousin that it is HH. I then challenged him if there were security cameras so we can check the time stamp. I was fuming at the point because 1. No ownership of your mistakes 2. No empathy or even care that your customer is upset/ don't even bother to have DIALOGUE to discuss problem, just point fingers as if I'm wrong. And then just charging us the full price instead of honoring your HH. 

I need to make a disclaimer here: I am someone who believes is tipping and I will almost ALWAYS leave 20% regardless of how the food turns out, IF there is ANY customer service. ROB is incredible in that he DGAF.

It's upsetting that a place as fancy and nice as this sushi restaurant lacks so much in their customer service. What a bummer to this Vegas trip.

We ordered the Pacific Roll, along with a spicy salmon roll, some salmon sashimi, and a spicy tuna-crispy rice appetizer.  The salmon sashimi was the best of all the menu items we tried, and the only item that we would absolutely order again (it's also the one that's based most on the fish and least on the quality of the chefs).  The spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna appetizers were average.  The Pacific roll, on the other hand, was terrible.  The albacore tuna tasted like it came from a can, and I could not finish the roll.
Our waiter was also pretty bad.  He started off by sitting on the table next to us while taking our order, not just leaning against the table, but actually sitting on the eating surface.  I almost felt like telling the people who sat there after he got up, and I wondered if he also sat on our table.  Once our server took our order, he disappeared into the back or just chatted with other employees the whole time.  When we were done eating, I had to flag down a buss-boy to ask for our check, and when the server brought it to us, he disappeared again for over 10 minutes before he picked up the credit card.  He then went to go chat and joke with some other employees for about ten minutes BEFORE he even ran my card through the machine.  
With the combination of high prices, lack of selection on the happy hour menu, bad tasting rolls, and bad service, I will not be back here again.",V28MqLYwagJz62YfyPi3qg,1,0,2,7YJnzDAG8FIjLgntxSjcxA

I ask a friend if there was any good sushi place on the strip and she suggested this place, but she said it kind of pricey. Lucky for me we came on a Sunday during Happy Hour and the prices were actually good. 

I give the food 3 Star. It was good, but nothing special. Lucky I came during happy hour cause I wouldn't think it worth the full price. However there presentation is worth 4 stars it nice and very elegant. We order most of the things on the Happy hour menu and they were all good. I wouldn't order the Sashimi because it wasn't worth the price we paid since it wasn't on the Happy Hour menu, but I like Sashimi, but what we got wasn't good. 

The place look very nice and hip. It a good place for a group of friends to hang out at. We had a table and later ask to be moved to the booth because the rest of our group hadn't show up yet and a booth was free. They moved us quickly and didn't have a problem with it. Services was good and everyone was nice. There was a DJ and if you wanted it to be less noisy you can sit out in the patio area where it more quited.

First, the food: 4 Stars. Everything I've tasted is good! I'm a sucker for the Gojira roll and Boyfriend gets the Viva Las Vegas roll. The appetizers are tasty and the nigiri doesn't seem to disappoint. The tempura-fried ice cream is one of my all-time favorite desserts. However, I'd like a bit more bang for my buck. We know to come here when we're not super hungry, since we can't afford to stuff ourselves here. It's a nice date-night treat though. 

Second, the service: 3 Stars. It definitely leaves something to be desired. It's not that the waitresses are unfriendly; it's more an issue with the timing of the meal. It's not at all uncommon for one diner to have finished their roll before another diner receives theirs. Given that, in my case, all the food is ordered (and should be put into the kitchen) at the same time, it should all come out together. Even a delay of a couple of minutes is fine, but 15-20 minutes? Not acceptable.

*For those of you doing the math and wondering why RA gets 1 star, not the 3.5 star average you'd assume based on the above, read on:

There is one thing that RA could do to turn this 1 star review into a 4 star one. It's incredibly simple and won't cost them a dime. For the love of all things holy, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN! It's so loud that you have to yell in order to be heard by the person sitting next to you. It's obnoxious and serves no purpose. Loud music is great, but not when you're trying to have a nice dinner and, you know, speak to your dining buddy.

All in all, despite actually wanting to go back (as I said, date-night treat!), we won't be returning until the music is turned down. It really, really kills what would otherwise be a perfectly wonderful dining experience. RA, please fix!!!",__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ,1,0,1,b7IapbE9weDPMe88vLCI_A

I ordered the assorted vegetable tempura appetizer (came with asparagus, sweet potato, green beans) and the chili ponzu yellowtail roll. The vegetable tempura appetizer was pretty good and they were very generous with the number of pieces they served. The chili ponzu yellowtail roll contained spicy yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, and garlic and was served with a chili ponzu sauce. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce, but they do serve it on the side! The roll itself was pretty standard in taste.

My friend ordered the Dinner Sashimi Assortment; which I believe came with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and another type of fish along with rice and miso soup! I was so sad that find out that she had found bones in her some pieces of her fish. I know that my friend does enjoy eating sashimi, so I felt super bad that she had to experience those bones while eating. It would totally take away from my dining experience. 



PRICING
To be completely honest, I was pretty surprised when my friend and I sat down and looked at the menu. I expected their dishes to cost a lot more as expected on the Strip. However, the prices were pretty average for a sushi place! I believe the vegetable tempura appetizer was about $6 and the yellowtail roll was about $12. 



SERVICE
The service here was really attentive. Our server came to check in on us and asked if we needed anything as he passed by our seating area. I am also really glad that the manager gave my friend a discount on her sashimi plate as she had found bones in her fish.",1J2zVswrcASag0M34sVsFw,2,0,2,b_-RUiZ-bGJCAgMduJa_hg

I will start with the bad.  The happy hour menu was cheap enough, but only had about 10 things to choose from.  The sushi we ordered was fine, nothing special, but anything that came out of the fryer was terrible.  The crab cakes were absolute crabp.  The fried spicy tuna roll was not edible.  At the end of the day, I would have rather paid full price for food I could eat than half price for food I cannot.  Even at full price, I recommend paying a bit more and eating at a top-notch sushi spot, which Vegas has a lot of.

-The location is great because it is on the Strip but being on the outskirts of Fashion Show Mall it is not that difficult to navigate to get there without setting foot (or car) on the Strip.
-They have a nice foursquare check-in that gives you either an order of edamame or a miso soup.  Pretty cool.
-The Ra'chin Shrimp (appetizer shrimp) that is available during the happy hour is really good.  The sauce doesn't really complement the dish, but the shrimp are nice without it.
-The Viva Las Vegas Roll and the seared tuna are really good.  They are more of a fusion but it totally works.  I order them each time I am there.

The consistent:
-The servers have bigger attitudes than any other restaurant I have ever been to, consistently.  Once you understand that they aren't being personally rude, that they're just being kind of vapid because they don't care.... Last week my boyfriend sent back chicken wings because they tasted ""off"" (he did have indigestion later), our server said, ""Well, I always liked them,"" and walked away.  She took them off the check and the table, but she was kind of a dismissive jerk about it.  We have come to just expect that from the service, like you're inconveniencing them by being there.
-The music is so so loud.  The bar portion of RA is fun, yes, but when you are over in the table portion, you don't want to hear the pounding music over your conversation.  This consistency is why I avoid being there after 9pm.

The bad: 
-My luck must be placing me in the women's room when there is either a line or no toilet paper.  It's always one or the other, especially when one of the two stalls was out of commission.
-They pride themselves on a great sake list but they often have 86'ed whichever I am ordering.  Boo.  I guess I should have placed that in consistencies as well.
-Happy hour for drinks is good.  But I was shocked to see how skinny the rolls because during happy hour.  It was almost comical.  I won't be going to dine there again under the guise of a deal.

All and all, if you don't mind dismissive service but need to get something without the drama of heading into the heart of the Strip, it's good, but don't go in with high high hopes.",Wa_dytXjCuUri4CJsKSd3w,4,1,3,KTom3cCBQM2s5NmOiu_d1w

2596239,2010-08-18,0,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"For those who understand some Japanese, ""RA"" is also spelled in hiragana to sound like ""raw,"" which is a somewhat clever name for a sushi restaurant.
Too bad this place is more like ""ME,"" as in ""meh."" (sorry, apparently the hiragana can't show up on yelp).

The decor is nice and fancy, but there's an obsession with the color red once you step inside that is really overbearing. The lights are so red it puts such a strain on your eyes that it was painful just to read the menu. Seriously, I felt like I was trapped inside a Nintendo Virtual Boy machine or something. And when the food came out, it didn't even look that appetizing because you can't even tell what you're eating unless you take a picture with flash - then you can appreciate the colors and effort they put into the food's presentation.

I ordered the Viva Las Vegas Roll and Crazy Monkey Roll. The VLV was primarily a crab & cream cheese concoction, with a nice fried lotus root which added a nice crunch. This was good, but after a few pieces, you kind of lose track of the flavor of the seafood which gets overtaken by the other ingredients (a common trait in Americanized sushi). The Crazy Monkey Roll was sweet with the teriyaki sauce glaze and cashews - the sweet and shiny look made it seem like fish baklava. Kinda good, but strangely gross too if you think about it. As for my friends, most had worse luck. Two ordered the same Lobster Shrimp Roll, but one got the short stick as his lobster tasted off ~ it seemed old. Yuck.

As for the service, it was a mixed bag. Attentive waiters readily refreshing my glass, but the chefs were slow: my CMR came almost 20 minutes after I received my VLV.

Overall, if you like Americanized sushi and a flashy modern settings, then RA might be the place for you. But if you like your eyeballs and actually want to taste your seafood in your sushi, you probably have much better options elsewhere in Vegas for your sushi fix.",VoSRkkKzLEPkfXTq-KBNQA,0,0,2,x5-zM3W4lKxKtqYVk8_XOw

Last minute there were more people added to our party and the hostess was accommodating. Though it took some convincing and i believe it was due to them not being busy that night. We started our dinner with a round of drinks and some peppers. Their peppers were undercooked and the worst of all places i had ordered the same type of peppers. 

We also ordered ceviche as an appetizer which was served with unrippened avocados, one type of fish, and maybe a few shrimp. Though it was the best of all items ordered, it was definitely not considered ""good."" Once our drinks came out, we were all enjoying our time and placed our entree orders with the server. Our roll took the longest to arrive and it was not even the correct order. We continued to just eat the unsatisfactory appetizers to suppress our hunger and continued asking the server when our roll would be out. As everyones food finished they brought out our roll and another appetizer that they had forgotten to originally deliver. 
We felts as though for a place like Las Vegas, we would have had more attentive servers and much better customer service. We had to wait around 20 minutes for them to bring out our bill, which we asked numerous times for. The bill had a lot of incorrect orders on it and we had to have them adjust again which required another 15 minutes of our time. 
Overall the dinner experience was mediocre at best. I understand that we were a large party and it is more difficult to accommodate everyones needs, but the lack of attentiveness we received was not acceptable. However, they did have good fried rolls, which is what a few of the other members in our party had ordered.

2648869,2008-10-15,5,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"""Don't worry, it's only across the street."" I think I've said that same line to about fifteen different people as we're walking ""one block"" across Las Vegas Blvd from the Palazzo to Fashion Show Mall. It does look close, what they don't realize is that with all the causeways and walkways and the fact it's 115 degrees outside and that we need to keep stopping to light cigarettes, finish our mojitos, and check our cell phones that are blowing up, that it will take 15 minutes to walk there.

RA Sushi is on the Wynn side corner of Fashion Show Mall, totally Vegas style, you've pretty much got a lot of what you want in there, and also a lot of what you don't. On the darker side in regards to lighting (note: beneficial information, darker means cooler temperature, bonus) the restaurant has a large sushi bar and wonderful glowing red orb light fixtures throughout giving it a modern yet Asian feel. There's always ample seating, my servers are gracious and usually totally hot (note for men: hot sexy waitresses serving sushi, not bad) and their outside area is where you'll find me and my crew.

Veggie gyoza potstickers with spicy sauce, super tasty miso soup (yes, sometimes there IS a difference), and beef skewers that just hit the spot. There's even a happy hour where drinks and sushi/appetizers are extremely inexpensive so we stock up before we hit the tables once again. The sake list is good, so you can get your drink on, and the mixed drinks aren't half bad at all. My sushi comes quickly and is always fresh. The fish is good and light, and the rolls creative and most on the larger side. You don't have to drop dollars and make it rain to eat like a rockstar here which is good, especially if you hit up Sushi Roku the night before and your 400 dollar bill isn't exactly what you were looking for to spend for lunch with your roll dawgs. 

My waitress hooked me and my girl up last time like superstars, and she's always taken care of me there. We tip well, they take care of us. Plus afterwards if you've gotten your buzz on as appropriate in Vegas, you can go shopping galore inside, walk back across the street (for the high rollers) and hit the Wynn, or do as we do: Plan ahead, wear our bikinis to go to the pool, desperately try to make it everyday, and instead end up sitting at the tables, playing like it's going out of style.",lOMM7HTHhabi1qofd-w7zw,6,6,4,H3rdlKY_3LxKtJGhCjogyQ

I was feeling fancy fresh so the thought of a $18 steak sounded like a great idea at the time. The more cash money the item on the menu is, means the food is better, amirite? Well I was wrong!  

$18 for peppered steak and it was salt bombed with salt bombs beyond repair. I was seriously dehydrated like a mofo after the first bite. RATED: 2/5 

$18 for crazy tough Teriyaki beef. I wasn't about to let my digestive system work overtime. The meat was insanley gristly. My teeth couldn't process it and had to spit it out. RATED: 2/5 

I was not expecting this much of a mouth work out for dinner. It was an unfortunate execution of simple dishes. 

The service is also questionable. Tell me, when is it appropriate to pull up a chair, snag the leg on my pants and plop down to take my order? That was mortifying! I will never ever understand that approach.

I guess everything on the menu was an additional $3 since we were straddling lunch / happy hour/ dinner. 

The waitress was like half helping us half flirting with some other customers and dicking around in the back. This totally pissed me off. Just because they worked at the hotels and you were trying to get into some club for tonight or whatever it is - you still have other customers you should attend to! Additionally, It looked like most of the wait staff was on lunch break and they were eating pizza in front or hiding in the back. We got an appetizer and no utensils. We had to ask the busboy to get us some. All the tables around us had cloth napkins but we ended up getting bar napkins and some forks. Wait, he threw in chopsticks for good measure too...

The icing on the top was when we got the bill. She wrote a big ""THANK YOU! =)"" on the receipt AND circled the ""suggested tip"" section. WHAT THE FUCK?

The kids got crab and cream cheese and it all fell apart and was just average.  The other child got sashimi and it came with radish noodles which was a nice dish.  Then the other mother got the tuna salad and it was nice but didn't seem anything special as limited tuna in it and a basic salad with tuna on top.

I did have to ask for more ginger twice as well and we had to ask for chopstix helpers for the kids when most places offer if they have them.

We decided to go across the street to RA for a little more of a casual experience. I would definitely recommend coming here. I will be back, next time I'm in Vegas.

-atmosphere- classy casual, on the darker side with red lighting and accents.

-drinks- I was drinking beer and sake so kinda hard to screw that one up. My wife enjoyed the variety of cocktails on the menu. She really enjoyed the blackberry cocktail on the menu. Not too sweet and plenty of alcohol.

-food- We started off ordering an albacore roll to share, just feeling the place out. The roll turned out to be really good! That lead us into ordering the sashimi salad which was great. They went a little heavy on the sauce, but it still turned out good. We also ordered the toro nigiri, and another roll.

During the month of July, Ra is running a 4 for $30 promo with select menu items after 3pm every Wednesday. I receive email notifications from Ra (as a FORMER SERVER FOR RA!) and thought this was a fantastic deal! Hubby and I went for dinner tonight around 8pm and noticed immediately that they did not give us the promo menu along with our reg menus. Thinking it was just a mistake of the host, possibly, I mentioned the promo to the server and she said they were no longer offering the promo. Again. giving them the benefit of the doubt, I say ""are you sure? I received an email about it....and its on the website...."" she then says ""well, it might be other locations, but not this one. are you ready to order?""

Flabbergasted, I pull up the Fashion Show ad showing the promo advertised, and she continues to insist they are not offering it. We order anyway and I go find a manager. He apologizes, hands me two promo menus and says he will send the server back over to get our corrected order. 

I can honestly say that in all my years working in restaurants (and eating in them of course), I have NEVER seen a server blatantly LIE and insist on continuing the LIE even in the face of proof! WTF? Trust me, I get it. I understand that you may think you'll get a lesser tip bc the bill is lower blah blah blah, but still. Have some morals! Its one thing to ""not mention"" the promo, its entirely a different (not to mention unethical) thing to completely deny its existence and refuse to even ""make sure""! Gotta wonder how many other people have been fed this line of BS and believed it!

They looked nice and they were really creative (especially the vegas roll), they tasted okay.  Pretty good, but not great -- it didn't seem like the freshest quality and the texture of the rice was a bit off, like a bit hard maybe?  I do love their menu and the fact that they have such unique rolls, extensive and creative appetizers as well.  The only appetizer I got to try was their calamari, which was thick and yummy, since they were out of their cream cheese pineapple pot stickers.

What I really love about this restaurant is the bar!  I definitely recommend going during happy hour and getting drinks and maybe a roll or appetizers.  They have an extensive cocktail menu with plenty of fruity and sweet drinks, martinis, frozen drinks, sake, and even about a dozen flavored bombers. I loved the red white and blue bomb and the lychee saketini.  The unami punch is pretty good but insanely strong! I enjoyed a few other drinks there but I forgot the names!

Minus one star b/c it took a long time for the dishes to come out, and only one ginger/wasabi plate per table (which subsequently made me feel bad for asking for refills multiple times).

Maybe because we were hungry, right next to the Fashion Show Mall, and it was right around Ra Sushi happy hour time. 

When we arrived, the place was pretty empty and the music was pretty low. Besides the lighting, the atmosphere was the complete opposite of the first time I came here when it was jam packed and extremely noisy. 

We were seated right away in a comfy booth. The waitress explained the menu and brought out water right away. We decided to order sesame chicken wings, tootsi maki roll, shrimp tempura roll, edemame, and dengaku tofu. 

The food came one at a time and we devoured each plate. My favorite dish was probably the chicken wings. They were just so flavorful and perfectly marinated. I also really loved the tofu. My boyfriend didn't enjoy it that much, so I pretty much got it all to myself, which was a nice treat. 

All in all, I was surprised at my experience since I wasn't all that fond of this place the first time around. I think it's best to come here sometime in the middle of the week when the place isn't so crazy and you can actually hear the person you're with.

This restaurant is very beautiful, modern yet still classic, the booth was so comfy and relaxing. Hubby was hungover much, he just wanted some extra hot soup, I was hungry, so I ordered quite a few things for myself. 

Our lunch: extra hot spicy soup, with side of udon noodles, mackerel sashimi, salmon roe sushi, spicy tuna hand roll and appetizer hot mess. 

The spicy soup was so good, did they put this on the menu just for hangover people? Lots of veggies and shrimps in it, the broth was very flavorful and comforting! 

Raw things were fresh and tasty, the appetizer hot mess was spicy king crab on crispy rice, it was delicious but just a little too creamy for me, and it was a big plate for myself, left out all the crispy rice, shame on me! 

Overall we liked the food so much! They couldn't make a Bloody Mary for me at the moment cause the bartender stepped out for a good 10 minutes, when she came back in she found out they just ran out of Bloody Mary mix... well, I ordered a mimosa instead, it was tasty.

Garlic Edamame: I could drink the garlic sauce. Super flavorful and comes with a good amount of perfectly cooked edamame. I even dip sushi pieces into the leftover sauce lol bomb. $5.30

Mango Lobster Roll: lobster mix, avocado & cucumber rolled with mango on top served with mango & kiwi. Their ""lobster mix"" is basically imitation crab, I never taste any lobster at all but I love the mango and kiwi sauce. $11.25

Viva Las Vegas Roll: crab and cream rolled inside, light tempura deep fried and topped with spicy tuna, crab mix and light lotus root finished with eel sauce and shrimp tempura pieces. Pretty good and always a hit with the relatives visiting from out of town. $13.25

They also have lunch specials daily from 11am-3pm.

Why this place has any reviews under 3 stars is shocking to me. If the parking situation and prices were lower it would be an easy 5. So basically if this spot wasn't on the strip it would be ideal to me. Although I did enjoy the outdoor seating which included plenty of good people watching. (Fun times at the fashion show mall on Christmas eve) But overall, I had a wonderful experience. 
To start, we (my sister and I) decided to check out the all day happy hour they offered on the holiday. They did this both Black Friday and Christmas eve, so I am guessing this is a normal holiday or shopping day thing for Ra. Our other halves don't do sushi, so we enjoy exploring new places. The menu pricing seemed high, so all day happy hour was the perfect opportunity. 
We began our meal with a garlic sesame style edamame. No doubt about it I will order this every single time I come. Why places have not been doing this forever is the real question!
We went with a couple classics like a philly roll and shrimp tempura. The tempura roll came with asparagus, Total win to me. I also ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll. A mix of many things topped with spicy crab and a crunchy wheel. I can't even explain it. Just trust that this is the roll you DO NOT want to miss! It started to get cold after the sun wasn't in view anymore so I ordered a Miso HOT! soup. It came out in a rod iron steel type bowl and had shrimp and green beans in it. I will come back for this alone. (well and that amazing edamame!) 
I really wanted to try the hot mess balls as well. A spicy tuna, jalapeno, deep fried ball type thing. Not too sure what it is, but I will be finding out soon! 
Also the white sangria was super sweet, and the Cucumber Collins was a perfect afternoon. refreshing, nice buzz but not too strong type of drink. Although they didn't give us the happy hour discount on the sangria. We didn't complain because the difference was only $1.75. The real happy hour specials are the rolls.
Also, if you're not into sushi they had many shrimp options, and even a couple beef and chicken dishes. I would suggest trying it during one of their many happy hours!",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,1,0,4,wDSQxVwXEyUCX5dA6NYlcw

Not only that, she forgot to put in my friends soda order and then forgot to put in her sushi order. say bye bye to your tip lady!

I got the chicken katsu bento box which didn't look like much, chicken katsu seemed lacking but it definitely filled me up. Everything was acceptable except for the sauce that came with it in a separate little dish which I really disliked and didn't use at all.

So I have been to a couple of the other locations in different cities including Atlanta where I use to live and I have never received the type of service that was exhibited today! For starters let's talk about how excited I was to actually eat here and how that excitement quickly turned into a ""sorry I even bothered situation""

I had some girlfriends visiting from out of town and they were in the mood for drinks and sushi and suggested that since we were already meeting at Fashion Show Mall to of course try RA! Upon being seated I was greeted by a friendly waiter and had our tables order taken shortly after that. Turns out it was happy hour and we didn't even know it so we all ordered a round of drinks! 1 strawberry patron margarita..1 cucumber and lastly my traditional! After one sip I literally gagged because I said to myself ""there's no way in hell this is a patron margarita"" my friend said the same about hers.. Completely watered down and just not how that particular drink should taste! Here's the thing as a drinker that has a drink of some sort on the regular your taste buds know how it should be.. Today that wasn't the case.. Asked for a new drink and I kid you NOT it took a whole 15-20 for my newly made drink and at this point I was beyond livid that my food hadn't even came but yet my friends were more than halfway done with theirs and I'm sitting there flabbergasted! Really? Like our waiter had nothing to say other than he was sorry.. The bartender had to be new or was just that awful on not only her pour on the drinks but just in general. My problem is that they weren't even busy.. Not that that would make a difference but I'm trying to give the benefit of doubt.. 

While we were wrapping up the manager Dave comes by to ask how everything was. Hmm of course I explained everything to him that I just typed above and let him know that this was completely out of the standards that I had for RA! He simply responded with ""well I'm sorry but that's illegal to water the drinks down and I'm sorry you had the experience..here is a free appetizer card for the next visit..bye"" like really? Oh and then they thought that just taking $4 off those late ass margaritas they served us was going to be a peace offering? No thanks! I will never go out of my way to be back and take a chance on being bamboozled again.. Super disappointed with the lack of professionalism and just the approach that he took as a manager. What ever happened to looking the part? He strolled up in some jeans an oversized flannel shirt with his monotone nonchalant tone.

My daughter ordered edamame but got miso soup (we finally did get the edamame).  We ordered some sashimi (salmon and yellowtail).  Our server said the salmon was super fresh.  Neither appetizer looked or tasted fresh.  The yellowtail was mushy and swimming in wasabi sauce (again, out server told us it was not very spicy when we ordered).  The salmon was likewise, soft and mushy.  We had a lobster and shrimp roll that was mediocre and saturated in what seemed to be mayonnaise....yech!  We ordered a second round of drinks (one beer and two wines) which didn't come until we had finished the meal.  One order of sashimi never came and our server had to be reminded...he finally brought it when we were ready for our check.  During the evening, we had a difficult time finding our server....we finally asked another server to locate him.  This happened three times during the 90 minutes we were there.

I ended up getting an avocado roll, cucumber roll and some pineapple and cheese wontons. Really hard to believe those are made in house. The wontons were so crispy it broke when I ate it and had barely any cheese inside. The sauce was fantastic. Sucks when you have an amazing sauce but nothing good to dip in it.

The avocado rolls and cucumber rolls were as you expect. Avocado and rice and cucumbers with rice. Nothing memorable but nothing bad. It was just...good. When I go to places on the strip I expected to be wowed. I have been wowed with sushi before so it's possible.

This place is good for happy hour but I wouldn't come back for anything else. I also fear they don't have other servers like Adam. So chances of me getting a server that blows me away....not looking hot. That speaks volumes for his service.

I'm glad they were half price cause had I had to pay full price for any of it I would've been maaad. I eat a lot of sushi, maybe I should start writting more reviews because all the places I've been to deserve way more cred than this place is getting. The portions were small, the service was bad. I asked for things like three times, cups for the beer, they gave us two cups for the sake when we clearly had a party of three, sauces were missing, etc. Our waiter seemed to be occupied with a thousand things at once and every time we waved him down he'd give us like half a glance. Yeah I wish I could say the sake special made it all worth it but that would be a lie as well. The sake container was so tiny it gave us roughly two full cups per serving at $2 a pop.

It took 20 minutes (no exaggerating) before someone even came and took our order. She apologized and said the waiters were getting slammed and she came over to help out (we later found out that she was the bartender, and when she saw us not getting served, came out). She was the one bright spot in this shitty shitty experience.

Our actual waiter came out 5 minutes later (25 minutes on the game clock for those following) to take our order. Too late, buddy! A third waiter then brought us water.

Another 20 minutes went by (45 minutes now) and all of my sushi had come out, but my friend's chicken teriyaki hadn't arrived yet. I flagged down the lazy waiter and rather sternly asked him to track the dish down. It came out another 10 minutes later (55 min) without so much as an apology. 

The menu itself has more rolls with cream cheese on it than any self-respecting sushi place would allow. I got two of the few that didn't and a couple pieces of nigiri, totaling about $40. I ate $40 worth of grocery store grade sushi. And not a good, Asian grocery store, I'm talking about sushi from Ralph's or Safeway. It was terrible.

We ended up not tipping the rest of the wait staff at all for their shitty service, but gave the bartender a fat wad of cash and told her not to share.",fbCELURV7LPoNryjt-0UTQ,0,0,1,SMzfHQFLZQRkvJ6x2rgygQ

Their portions were so small, and the ambiance was pretty cool... a little too Americanized cool for my taste though. I am the type of person that doesn't go out much for sushi because my dad makes it at home at a much better quality and freshness. So for me to go to a sushi bar means either (1) I am REALLY craving sushi, (2) other people around me are craving it, or (3) the ambiance is really hot. 

Well... I think 2 out of 3 apply in this case, however I can't say the sushi was by any means high quality. The rice wasn't made well and it is just about a little better than your typical buffett made sushi. 

Well... since the happy hour prices were awesome, I can't complain much (the party of 8 frat boy gringos next to my table certainly seemed to love their ""cultured"" sushi experience)

okay... let me break it down my take on the restaurant....

Sushi Quality: 2 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars, if you are looking for a posh thing. But if you want traditional, 2 stars is more like it.

The price was surprisingly affordable, according to Vegas standards, and the seafood was super fresh.  We were starving and parched and this place was a wonderful surprise!

The look is very trendy and would be a neat place to be in the evening.  We were there at the beginning of lunch time and were seated almost immediately.  The waitstaff were professional and friendly, no complaints on their customer service whatsoever. 

For appetizer we had the Crispy Spicy Tuna.  The raw tuna mixture is served on top of crispy rice with a pepper soy sauce with fresh jalapeno on top. It tasted super fresh and the heat from the jalapeno was exactly what I would want.  If you don't enjoy spice, this is probably not the appetizer for you.  Because the pepper is fresh, not pickled, it can pack a little punch.

For our meal my husband and I shared the: Scallop Dynamite, Spicy Lobster, Ra'ckin Roll, and Viva Las Vegas rolls.  All were beautifully served and tasted amazing.

When in Vegas, I normally do not eat at restaurants... It's always buffets.

However, figuring it was a Friday night and July 4th, we thought it would be best to eat at a restaurant instead of facing the long buffet dinner lines.

I chose this place because the Yelp reviews said it was decently priced with decent food and it was close to our hotel.

We sat down with about 20 minutes left before the end of Happy Hour so my brother and I ordered 5 items - 4 food items and 1 huge Tsunami punch (which I neglected to read from the reviews that it is a drink to share).

Highlights-
-The drink was yummy. My mom liked it a lot. I think she drank more than I did!
-I ordered my usual soft shell crab which they cooked with a harder-than-I-am-used-to batter and covered it with sesame seeds - it took away from the flavor the crab. 
-I did not like the texture of the agedashi tofu. 
-Nice selection on the sashimi combo - I ate my dad's tako sashimi. Yum! Chewy without giving my jaw too much of a workout. 
-The rolls we ordered were only okay. I did not taste all the flavors I remembered reading on the menu when I ordered them.

If you want some cheap sushi this is definitely the spot, just do the happy hour before you decide on doing dinner to see if it meets your standards.  I would be ticked to get that sushi at full price",InxaL8hCQrs6XmLtbkcjSA,0,1,4,7fO9pviW4WhrjJxt84z-dg

I don't understand why there are multiple locations throughout Tucson, AZ, but none in the whole state of Colorado.  With that being said, I absolutely love RA.  It is in my top 5 favorite sushi restaurants of all time. They have excellent service, great happy hour prices and amazing sushi.  I have taken someone who didn't even like sushi to try RA,and they became a fan. Literally. Open one in Denver!!!

I always rant and rave about this place. I don't think I can say enough great things.  This time, we stopped in to the Vegas location across from the Wynn Hotel. This location is a bit tough to get to, but well worth the trek. We ordered off the happy hour menu and really couldn't decide, so we actually ordered entirely way too much food. We started with the calamari, which I had never had there.  It was lightly battered in tempura batter.  I would suggest getting this if you are sharing for a table of 4 or more.  The dish was a pretty large portion. It was good, but I am not sure if we would order it again based on the size. It is usually just my fiance and I.  Then we added the shishito peppers, which is one of my all time favs. We have ordered these at other restaurants and no one can replicate these to be anywhere near as great as RA. We then got the egg rolls and the gyoza. Both equally as tasty, just a ton of food. By that time, we should have stopped ordering, but, we needed to get some sushi.  Bring on the yellowtail! Yellowtail is my favorite fish and RA does it right. Soaking in ponzu sauce and topped with jalapenos, this dish will surely make your taste buds tingle. Top it off with more yellowtail and I was set for the day. I seriously just wish that they would open a location in Colorado.

This joint is our  must come for a quick fix type of place for us because we just love the tasty treats here.  It's the same as the one in Tustin on redhill location, but  dining in RA vegas, just seems alittle more fun.  I'm a little guilty for enjoying the non-vegan dishes this time...but like I said it's hard being vegan at vegas especially trying to be fair about the places and choices of food to eat with your partner.  

So I will just make this quick.  Very nice setting as usual...I love munching in the low dim glow of red lights all over, it's very intimate and makes the time more enjoyable.  Our waitress was very pretty by the way...I was drawn to her natural beauty...something we hardly see in vegas/employees. 

We got the chicken yakisoba which was mediocre. Only got it because of the veggies and noodles in it.  I love rolls...so we had over 5 different orders of rolls, and to me they all taste the same everywhere..cheap or expensive it taste the same.  The appetizers, this is a must order; the lobster spring roll. That was my favorite of all dishes.  It's lobster rolled up in fried thinly crisped wonton paper mixed with mango, cream cheese, & mild peppers.  It's the tastiest lobster roll I've ever had so I savored every morsel of it. lol because it was that good!  Comes in about 4 or 5 pieces so order more than 1 plate. The racklin shrimp was also a delight.  It's a crispy crumby type of shrimp that is placed on top of green lettuces that you dip into ginger teriyaki sauce.  Very very tasty.  I enjoyed it muchos. 

Cinnamon tempura ice cream was such an indulgence for my sweet tooth.  The green tea ice cream was okay.  I don't really drink alcohol so I tried their strawberry ginger lemonade.  It taste like strawberry sprite. So it's a nay for me. One of the items we got was in a happy hour menu so we got about $5 off our bill.

Hands down, I caught a good day as Lauryn the bartender only works one day a week.  She is awesome.  Friendly but doesn't take her job too seriously, and was witty enough to ask me if my sushi was ""uninventive"" after I quoted my own Yelp review 10 minutes earlier.

One nice addition is reasonably priced craft beers.  I had a Lagunitas Little Sumpin' for $5.50, which was definitely unexpected.  The two rolls I had were the Spicy Lobster Roll and the Zonie Roll.

I hate complaining, i just wanted food. When I got it, they told me it was comp'd. :) So I ordered a plethora of Sake and my night, was instantly better ( the hot sake was 2 dollars but man, you don't get much for it)

Alas we went back into RA Sushi and I gave the menus another hopeful glance. Despite the large number of items I would never order without somehow deviating, such as the inclusion of mango in an otherwise delightful sounding tempura roll, I miraculously found two dishes that will for sure bring me back:

The edamame dip, for starters. I'm a classic edamame lover and when I saw this, I knew I had to give it a try. The chips they provided with it looked a little too few at first so I majorly dipped my first handful and the dip itself was amazing. If you like tart spinach dip with a little bit of a sweet pickle flavour, then I definitely recommend this appetizer. And it turned out I should have been less generous with my first chips because I had chips left over as I was practically scraping the bowl clean!

Next was the calamari tempura roll. When you see it's rotating red and green colouring a from I assume the tempura crumbs, it looks like Christmas! It tasted pretty good, a little bland in flavour just because of the calamari and the cream cheese was a little overwhelming at the same time. It was OK.

I saved Lobster Shrimp Roll for last because it is simply the best. I don't believe I've ever had lobster in my sushi before but the combination of it with shrimp, avocado, crab mix, and rice was AMAZING. I was so impressed by it that I ordered it a second time, I just couldn't help myself!

I did spend a hefty $50 but granted it was a late Friday night with no happy hour but my taste buds justified it so it was well worth it. The service was okay, our server was very nice and polite but didn't bring wasabi for my friends Philadelphia roll and somehow forgot my iced tea would require sugar so we had to flag him down two separate times.

We came around 930pm on a Sunday, and the place wasn't that crowded. Their service is very poor and slow. We had to ask many times for water refills, and they even forgot to bring out the wasbi and ginger for our sashimi and rolls.
Let's start with the good stuff.
Yellowtail sashimi was the only best dish of the nite. The cuts were perfect and thick. It's wasn't the best,but it pass.
Viva Vegas Roll how can they like this. The roll barely had any spicy tuna mostly imitation crab,and it was to sweet for my taste buds.
Crispy Onion Albacore was a mess on the plate. The albacore looked like it was cut by a dull knife. Plus they drowned it with so much ponzi sauce were you couldn't taste the fish anymore.
Tropical Roll was ok. It was something different. Great presentation but no Wow factor there.
The only reason it made it to 3 star instead of 2 is because of the yellowtail sashimi was good.Other than that there's better places to get your sushi fix.",BNuPibT74jf8Kp47bZb7DQ,16,11,3,ASa_zMSqdc2E9gJJtNkaQw

We checked Ra's website and it said they were still serving food until Midnight so we wandered down and got there a little before 11:30pm. 

First, there was music blasting so loud that I could barely hear the hostess at the door, and it was bad rap/techno blends. Then the hostess tells us that they will be closing the food soon so to go to the bar area. So my friend and I wander over to the bar which was right next to the DJ, and the bar was completely full so we sat down at a table about 5 feet away. There was people with menus and food at tables either side of us, so we thought no big deal. 

10 minutes go by, of waiters and waitresses, 3 of them for 2 tables, ordering and cleaning up the rest. We finally snagged one, and asked if we could order. She just rolled her eyes and said they were closing down, and walked away. Finally the Hostess came over, got our orders for 2 creme brulees, so easy to do, and brought us waters. The next 20 minutes, we sat there, totally ignored by the wait staff, even as they walked right by us, until my friend went to talk to the hostess again, who found our creme brulees and brought them to us. The only time the wait staff willing interacted with us was when it was time to pay and my friend got up with the bill fold to pay at the bar with it. 

Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip. 

The only reason I am giving them 2 stars at all, is the Hostess did her best to make sure we got our dessert, and coconut vanilla creme brulee was absolutely amazing.",f9DfHWve3YX_CyYDXm5dxg,0,0,2,z7I2R1GFlvXeG08pJR6iYg

Ra Sushi is one of the few places I can talk him into going to because they have dishes that he will actually enjoy, not just tolerate so that I can gorge on some raw fish...

Usually when I go to Ra it is for lunch. I typically get the sashimi combo for $11... it is 4 pieces each of tuna, salmon and yellowtail and comes with a bowl of rice and miso soup. He always gets the chicken bento box for $8... it comes with miso soup, rice, salad, gyoza and a spring roll. $20 and we both leave full and happy...

Pineapple Cheese Wontons - In a word, amazing.

Seared Tuna - Served with a tasty soy based sauce

Daily Lunch special hours: 11 am to 3 pm

Service: 4/5  From my frequent visits with the work crew, our favorite is Kalani.  Very sweet and attentive every time she was assigned to us.  We never had any issues with the other servers as well.  Host or Hostess at the door always gets us seated quickly with a smile.

Food: 3/5 I usually hit up one of the Bento Box lunch specials and for me the best one is the Sashimi Bento (2 piece of tuna, yellowtail and salmon) with Teriyaki.  Sashimi is decent for a franchised Asian restaurant but the Teriyaki Chicken has been disappointing on numerous occasions.  Very bland and dry.  Shishito Peppers have always been tasty on my visits.

Value 4/5: Lunch special bento boxes, bowls and Shogun Bento Boxes is good value for the price and quality.  I can't comment on evening dishes at this time. (see pics)

Ambiance: 3.5/4 Love the red lantern, neo-tokyo decor art throughout the restaurant.  Music is playing rather loud, right before the point of being too loud.  If someone is hard of hearing, conversation might be an issue.

Overall it seems like a great place for small bites and drinks with friends, the food came out very quickly which is great, especially if you're short on time.",zLABDPqk5gA-avT37yP7rA,1,0,4,v6NOnyXX4WLOClcceGxAcw

The apps took a long time to come out, but eventually we were munching away and somewhat happy.   Then we placed our entree orders.  We both went with a lunch special which was nicely priced and probably the only good thing I have to say about RA.   Then my friend fell asleep... that's literally how long it took them to get our miso soups out (aren't these already made and just need to be heated up??) and then fell asleep again before our entrees came out - and these were not complex entrees!

RA is located on the first floor of the Fashion Mall and with a good view of Encore/Wynn and the street.  It has a patio area to people watch which is pretty fun.  Coming in at lunch on a Sunday was pretty quiet and they do have some nice lunch specials like $10 bento boxes and a few other meal plans.  The bento box itself wasn't too bad in terms of value.  You get miso soup, rice, the bento box entree you chose (I got chicken teriyaki) and a small salad.  I also got the sake samplers which was $9 for three different sake tastings which were pretty good.  The miso soup wasn't too shabby.  The rice was just rice - nothing special.  The chicken teriyaki was a bit salty but was cooked all right.  And the salad was not bad.  Service was solid and helpful.   

They also have a happy hour (about 4-7PM if I remember correctly) with some good sushi/drink deals.

First of all, the service was bad. The place was near empty. 
We each ordered a roll and such.
Took awhile to bring out the water. 
Took awhile to bring the beer.[surprisingly cheap...$5 for asahi...not bad: they also have asahi light for $5. And an asahi + sake for 6.50 light and regular]

All of a sudden my sisters bf gets his food[scallop dynamite roll: Amazing. So much flavor] 

.....20 minutes later my little brother gets his plate [chicken yakisoba: pretty tasty good portion to share...but the little bro is greedy and ate the entire plate].

Almost an hour after they both get their food....My sister and I get our sushi roll. By that time we were over the entire experience. We had the ""viva las vegas roll"": we had had this before and.....this time it tasted horrible. We also had some ""crispy spicy tuna"" something that tasted like a rice crispy with tuna [gross].

What makes restaurants in Vegas so good is that they are ALL suppose to taste good...especially if the ambiance looks fancy! 

RA Sushi Bar was just decent. I wasn't wow-ed away by any of the sushi rolls my gf and I shared. We got 3 rolls: 

RA Lollipop: It was basically wrapped in rice paper with raw fish on the inside. I wasn't a fan of the sauce it came with because it enhanced the fish taste when I dipped it in. The presentation was nice. It rolls came on a stick so that it could emulate the ""lollipop"" look. 

Lobster Shrimp Roll: Couldn't really find the lobster or taste the lobster flavor in this roll. It seemed more like of a California roll topped with shrimp. Not only that if you dip the roll in the pesto sauce it comes with, the sauce overpowers the flavor so you couldn't have been able to tatse the lobser with the pesto taste covering it. Also the shrimp wasn't a bright pink color like I am used to. It looked kinda dead...

RA'kin Shrimp - this was the best out of the three. Lobster egg rolls: no lobster flavor, it was just fried mushy cream cheese logs. The Viva Las Vegas Roll - oh please. Was a faux California roll (only the krab), tempura-fried, with I think what was supposed to be spicy tuna on top, then a tarot slice garnish. Disappointing. I just ate the spicy tuna mix on top, and even with that, I've had much better. I'm used to really good, if not great, sushi. Another disappointing Vegas restaurant experience.

After a day full of shopping at Fashion Show Mall, RA Sushi is a good place to wind down and enjoy drinks and apps during their happy hour. There are drink/food items starting at less than $4. They have seating indoors and outdoors, so when it gets nice outside, it's great to be seated right on the Las Vegas strip. 

During happy hour, which I recall being from 4-7, their hot sake is only $3.75. You can do sake bombs (sake + Kirin) for $8, which is a little pricier than other sushi happy hours I've been to (but not bad for the strip). For food I'd recommend their Shishito peppers (so good when they're spicy) and their Viva Las Vegas roll. Yum! 

I've tried their sashimi bowl for lunch before and it wasn't anything special. The sashimi didn't taste very fresh. The service here can also get a little slow when they're busy. You'll be calling the server over rather than having them come check up on you.

For quality, it is more like a below fair to fair.  The fish is toward the try dry side and without much flavor.  The sushi rice texture is amature/wrong/chewy/tasteless.

The atmosphere is loud and fun.  You can see Wynn right across of the street in the bar area.  However, you cannot see your food because it is so dark and red all around.  If there is a  alien item on your sushi, you will put that in your mouth.

Service equals to the pricey you pay.  Meaning, you will get your food your ordered within a timely manner.  For example... The waitress will ask, ""How's your food?""  Before you hear the complete sentence, she is already gone.

We had to wait for our table so waited at the bar. They also had drink specials and the service was fast even though busy.

The prices for the happy hour menu are 50% off and they have quite a lot of items on the happy hour menu. Drinks, Appetizers, Sushi and dinner items. We got drinks, apps and sushi. We ordered about 10 different things plus drinks and our bill with tip was $80 - this is damn reasonable for this much food and drinks in Vegas.

My favorite items were:

Apps: pineapple cheese wontons (YUM!)
Sushi: Gojira roll (say with 50s movie Japanese accent) and Crispy Spicy Tuna roll
 
Plus the simple tuna nigiri was delicious - very fresh! 

It was crowded but the service was excellent. The waitress was always by to make sure we were good. Plus when one of our last rolls was taking a long time, she gave us another on the house.

I still give RA three stars because of the overall vibe of the restaurant which was kind of cool and hip.  On the saturday night when we dined, there was a DJ spinning really cool music, music you'd hear at a Club or bar.

Group visits are the best. You can have dinner with cocktails, eat too much and hit up the bar for a beer on your way out. It's sexy with all those red lanterns hanging about but hell, it's Vegas and that's to be expected.

It's centrally located in the Fashion Show Mall so you could make a day of it to avoid the heat.  Shop a bit, and take a cab back to your hotel for a nap with no trouble. Cab rides from there cost  $8 - $15 depending on how far South you are on Las Vegas Blvd. Any further North and you end up downing Royal Flushes at the penny slots in the Fitzgeralds. ( No!)

Mango Martin was on point so big ups to the bartender for making that.
RA Kckn Shrimp was so tasty!

Rob was the worst customer service i ever had in my life.
he was so mad at something or someone that it look like he wanted to hit one of us at the table. 
we asked him where is our food and he looks at us like were crazy. we asked him to read back our order to make sure we had it and instead of doing so he walked away and not once said Let me check or please hold on so then we asked for a manager.
You can see the sweat come down from his bald head and the veins on his neck and his eyes were about to pop out from his face! The only reason why you can see all this is that he got all in my face and told us to fuck off!

Tony the manger can and told us Adam will be helping us out for the night.
Told Tony n Adam everything and they was really sweet about everything and made sure we got everything we needed.
so thank you 2 for making the night better.
Adam knows we took card of him even after the bill got discounted thats not the point he got a fat cash tip from us.

if you look at the receipt we order a lot but did not want to eat it after that fact ROB went all crazy on us girls. we just wanted to leave.

We came across RA and decided to stop in.  We had a couple of Bento Boxes - AKA your basic combo meal (rice, salad, egg roll and tempura) in addition to a couple of Rolls.  Pretty good stuff.  Prices were ok, although I hear there is a MEAN happy hour.

We only saw our waitress twice - first to take our order and again to deliver the check - but the bus boy and the food runners took pretty good care of us.  We sat outside and could tell that the party of 9 to our left was taking up all our waitress' time, so she's forgiven.

I was starving so I may have went overboard ordering.

We shared (even though most dishes were mine) California Roll, Seared Tuna, RA'kin Shrimp, Viva Las Vegas Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Crunchy Calamari Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll.

Seared Tuna was excellent- nicely sliced and great melt-in-your-mouth texture. My cousin and I kept dipping blander rolls with this sauce... 

RA'kin Shrimp was my favorite here! Panko-crusted HUGE pieces of juicy shrimp on a bed of greens with a tasty dipping sauce. If I ever come here for happy hour again, I'm gonna order 3 of these and be done with it!

Viva Las Vegas Roll had a thinly sliced and fried lotus root on each piece but the cream cheese was so overpowering. Why do we need cream cheese on everything? Ugh. This was alright, but I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese on my rolls to begin with...

Shrimp Tempura Roll... meh. Not crunchy at all. Soft and cold shrimp tempura with way too much rice. And it's not even good quality rice.

Crunchy Calamari Roll was alright. Kind of same as the shrimp tempura roll, but this time, you hardly taste calamari and only the cream cheese. Again with the cream cheese! 

Spicy Salmon Roll was ok. Chopped up bits of salmon with a nice kick. The rice kind of ruined it, in my opinion.

Overall, great happy hour prices and my cousin and I loved the seared tuna and RA'kin Shrimp. This chain is more Americanized sushi, but on the strip, we can't complain too much.

My Husband had made a reservation days prior, for our anniversary, and noted he wanted some type of ""intimate"" table setting if possible. Seating us in the middle of the dining area rather than at a booth, when there were only 3 tables inside the whole place was just extremely rude and unfair given he was provided the option to note something in the reservation request.
Now to note, we had never eaten at this location before but had eaten at their Chicago location roughly 3 years ago and enjoyed it so much!
We were anxious to give this location a try and I'm glad we did. The happy hour is one of the best for sushi but not the greatest for drinks. They don't have flavored warm saki but have strange flavors you can add to yours. Our favorite roll that we remembered from Chicago is the Vegas roll and they reminded us why it is our favorite once again. We have never found a roll quite like it but love it! 
Unfortunately one of the rolls we ordered had mashed up avocado that clearly was a little aged as I had an allergic reaction and was unable to eat after that but my Husband enjoyed many other rolls.

(the bf's family is from hawaii and so is she, so they bonded fairly quickly). everyone ordered a bento, except for me (i ordered the bara chirashi bowl and his dad ordered the viva las vegas roll). food was delicious! the bowl was SO filling! hamachi, salmon and tuna sashimi, rice and avocado. i barely finished it! it was a perfect lunch - simple and satisfying.

visit #2: his parents had us watch their suite while they were away, and we wanted to go somewhere we could walk to. so - RA happy hour it is! we ordered a tsunami punch (fish bowl was $13 and the baby tsunami punch was $6. we were gonna get 2 anyway, so we opted for the regular price fish bowl). we also ordered short ribs, wings, salmon carpaccio, edamame and seaweed salad. bill was about $40. our server at the bar was awesome as well (tracy). we needed a few boxes and still have quite a bit of our fishbowl left. i think she noticed we were full and the itis was about to kick in, and since its on the strip you're able to take your drink with you in a to-go cup (i had no idea that was possible! im so use to places saying no!). we left there full and completely satisfied.

My last couple of visits have been on Sunday nights, late Sunday nights.  It's Service Industry Night (S.I.N.), and they have food and drink specials from 8 pm to midnight.  It's crowded by the bar, and the restaurant is still hopping.  Grab a drink and take a seat outside if you want to chitchat or in my case last night, sit under the heating lamp to stay warm.  A lot of locals hang out there despite it being on the strip.  Located in Fashion Show Mall, it can carry a crowd depending on the night.  As of late, they were advertising Reggae Nights and 80s Nights.  You'll find a small dance floor and if the DJ is spinning out some good tunes, it'll be too crowded for you to bust a move.  But that's okay, there are some good-looking people here that are worth watching out for.

When I leave Ra, I see red...

Maybe someday I'll come by and try out their happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm on weekdays.  Or just swing by during their regular hours and have a taste of their Signature Sushi.

Update! 03/19/08 - Why do I always find myself here on Sunday nights?  This time I had a chance to sit down and try the food.  We lucked out with a party of ten at 11:30 pm with no reservations.  We only had to wait about ten minutes to grab a table.  

I took advantage of their SIN food specials and got the Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($3.25), the Spicy Tuna Roll ($3.75), and the Scallop Dynamite ($3.50).  There's nothing special about these rolls, they use Sriracha  to make it spicy, and it's not one of my favorite ways to do it.  We thought the Scallop Dynamite was going to be a roll, but it's actually scallops and Asian mushrooms baked in their 'Dynamite' sauce.  It's pretty tasty, and the BF was eating up all the onions that came along with it.

I also tried their Coconut Shrimp Tempura ($3.75).  It comes with about four deep fried shrimps on skewers with a roasted pineapple dipping sauce.  It's probably best to eat them while their hot, it was okay by the time I got to them.  

The really great thing about their SIN drink specials is the $1.00 Warm Sakes.  However, they ran out of Sake flasks (tokkuris)!  The waitress arrived with our sake in wide rimmed glasses which pretty much defeats the purpose of the flask which is to prevent the heat from escaping!  They also ran out of sake cups (ochokos), so we asked for shot glasses.  She was completely out of that as well!  She did apologize profusely and it appeared she actually went around to look.  They just didn't have enough people cleaning up the tables and washing the dishes.  (I personally think it's a management problem and they should be used to their busy Sunday nights and sake drinking crowds.  Running out of tokkuris and ochokos really is unacceptable.)  As a result, I brought their rating from a four to a three.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,2,4,3,G4naO21IN-XhfMZ3yHhkTg

When we first walked in I was thrown by the loud music but soon they began playing more familiar toons. Somehow when the music is familiar it doesn't seem so loud. 

We started with edamame which was pretty good. It was steamed just right and not soggy plus they used those nice flakes of salt. Next came the miso soup and again yummy. Unfortunately from there the meal was just so so. I had the shrimp tempura bento box, and he had the chicken teriyaki bowl. We shared the ultimate shrimp roll. The food honestly was just bland.  Those who know me will be amazed to hear me say that as I tend to like blander foods.  The sushi roll was nothing spectacular and really not rolled very well. The shrimp and bento box was just so so and I was disappointed that they had no sweet n sour or duck sauce. Even acted like I was daft for asking for it. Those who joined us got a couple of rolls and felt it was so so too. They got the spicy salmon roll and asked for a new one as there was no spice taste at all. 

The service was so so. It wasn't terribly so there was no reason they didn't check on us a bit more. Basically they just seemed a bit nonchalant about it all. Honestly I'd skip this place. There must be better sushi places in Vegas.",0mcagVwRnntWiAjlWZ8zTg,0,0,2,9J0Hism12oB3ABZU7dXztw

If you don't want to deal with the mall Ra has it's own entrance independent of the mall. I love that they have a patio that faces the strip. Totally made me feel like we we're playing tourist. The inside of Ra has a huge bar and tons of booths. Of course they have a large sushi bar so you can sit at watch all the action. But since it was a nice day we sat on the patio. There was some construction blocking our view, but it wasn't that big of a deal. It still was fun to watch all the people passing by. 

Jessie had her birthday gift certificate that they give you on your half birthday and it's for $20. If you sign up on Ra Sushi's website ( ra sushi.com ) you can get one too. 

Since it was happy hour we took advantage of it by ordering the Citrus Garlic Yellowtail and the Ra Chips and salsa. Jessie ordered the Sashimi plate and some edamame. The Citrus Garlic Yellowtail was sliced so thin and the ponzu sauce gave it great flavor. The Ra Chips and Salsa was my favorite. It was tuna tartar that was mixed with avocado, cucumber, soy sauce and a fresh salsa. Instead of regular chips they had wonton chips that complimented it so well. Jessie's Sashimi plate was beautifully presented. The cuts of Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna, and Whitefish were cut so thin and came with a bowl of rice. The fish was so sweet and the soy sauce accented it perfectly. 

Our server was great! She kept our drinks filled and even brought us out more ice when she noticed ours had melted. She also had our food out at a fast pace. 

I can not wait to return to Ra Sushi! I've been dreaming about that Sashimi plate and the Ra Chips and Salsa. Those two items are a perfect meal. They do also have items other then sushi on the menu. This is a plus when you have people that don't like sushi and you do. I'll definitely be returning soon. They definitely get a huge YUM from me!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,1,2,4,xo4K9FkI3KFNPUkonCz_3w

They include almost every regular menu item in their HH menu, so the choices are plenty and the prices are fantastic given the portions.  I ordered 3 rolls just for myself (yeah, I'm a greedy B) thinking the rolls would be the usual HH size, but they weren't sized down, and I had way too much food.  

As far as food quality, I was pleased.  I'm not a huge nigiri or chirashi fan, and thus, cannot speak to the true quality and freshness of the fish.  I stick to the mostly rice filled, sauce topped rolls, and those did not disappoint.  The crispy spicy tuna, which probably wasn't sushi at all, was really good, as well as the Viva Las Vegas roll.

Our server seemed stressed and forgot our soy sauce which I had to go retrieve after waiting a while and it took a very long time to get the bill. 

My last gripe is about the noise level. It would not be an issue unless you are sitting outside next to the restaurant that they border (which we were).

Ra, please tell us why in the world it takes almost ONE HOUR to get 4 orders of Sushi when we saw 6 sushi chefs behind the bar?  Ok, we understand that it's crowded on New Year's Day which our horrible waitress claimed that was the reason why the pace was slow but seriously, ONE HOUR?  

Our hot food came out before our sushi order did.  Our waitress didn't even have the courtesy to keep us updated on what was going on until we had to ask.  When we did ask all she could say was that it's busy and that ""it's like that every year on New Year's day""  In our opinion, we've been to much busier restaurants with much friendlier service.  And another thing-- don't you think that if the restaurant knew that every year that New Year's day especially would be busy then maybe they would up the staf coverage for that day?  Hmmm, poor planning on management's part.

The sushi came out WITHOUT wasabi and ginger, uhmmmm.....pardon us for expecting those things to come with it.  Call me crazy but I just thought that was a GIVEN.  Didn't know you had to ask for wasabi and ginger with Sushi!!

And lastly, NOT FRESH and BAD fish.  When one person had a stomach ache afterwards we thought, eh....maybe it was something you ate earlier.  When another had a stomach ache we knew......yep must be the sushi and the bad service at Ra.

Dengaku tofu ($4)- this was a generous portion (8 slabs) and the tofu was silken and had a bit of roast veggies on top, but there was  oppmpf needed in the flavor. It was in tempura sauce with a drizzle of eel sauce but needed more of the eel for flavor.  I added a bit of soy, and ate it with sushi ginger for some bite.

Crispy Spicy Tuna ($5)- I love this at other sushi bars, but this version was just okay. It had a very big piece of rice and it was a bit cold so the crisp rice piece wasn't actually crispy since I suspect it was pre done. 

Crispy Onion Albacore ($5)- it was decent but not the best quality of albacore and very thin slices topped with some sesame dressing, French's onion, a bit of sprouts.

Every time I walk in, the security already knows me and gives me a hug to greet me.  The setting is very laid back and casual.  There's no dress code and it's comfortable.  As I enter, on the right there's the DJ booth and there's always different DJ's spinning.  On Wednesday's they have an open spin night.  The decor is very modern with bamboos for plants.  There are some good art work on the wall to spice up the scenery inside.  

As I walk a few steps more, there lies the bar and on most occasions that's where I'll end up but sometimes I'll take the table if I felt like it.  The stools are very comfortable and cushiony.  There are a lot of candles lit up through out the bar to give some lighting.  For the sports lovers, a huge flat screen TV hangs above the bar for some entertainment.  I've watched the Ms. USA on there one time.

5181866,2010-05-28,0,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"Came here for my belated birthday celebration in our bar-hopping night on and off the Strip. My friends have been raving about their happy hour which inspired me to check out Ra. Happy hour ends at 7 pm and we arrived about 10-15 minutes before that. I wanted a table but the place was full, so we sat at the bar- our fault for getting there late on a Saturday, I know. The bartenders were nice and even though we barely got there in time and probably ordered just as happy hour was ending, they didn't make a fuss about it and we still got the hh prices. Also I got a complimentary birthday drink. I really can't remember what it was (I am a hard alcohol and mixed drinks noob) but it was so good. It was supposed to be a birthday shot but they gave me just about 1/3 of a glass, so there's customer appreciation right there.

The happy hour menu has a small but ok selection for drinks, but is definitely limited for sushi. I ordered some half price sushi as well as full price. I've been enjoying sushi for a long time and while not an expert, I think I know good sushi. The quality of the sushi itself is mediocre. It's not a health hazard but the rolls did fall apart a handful of times and were definitely in the bottom half of what I've tasted. It was not bad but just ok. Their sushi is way overpriced especially for what is it (poorly constructed with small cuts) so I would not come here to get full on sushi, but just for a snack or small meal during hh. I'm usually not a big fan of the California roll but it was good here, despite the small portions. My drink was some kind of tropical punch with tequila (sorry, I said I really am a noob) and it was very good. I felt the $5 it cost was not robbery. To add, the time it took for our rolls to come was very appropriate considering they seemed pretty busy.

For a drink, a free drink and small meal (I think 3 rolls) I spent $19 including tip which is nothing to complain about. Luckily I was not that hungry that their small portions could really bother me, but I had a good experience there with my friends and liked the set up of the bar and especially the good service. Not-bad-but-not-great sushi and high prices will limit my appearances here but it's a good place to snack and hang out with people.

The ambiance was nice, and what you would expect from a moderately upscale sushi place, with dark wood, bright paper lanterns, and a variety of music at a decent volume.

My group of 8 wandered in on a Saturday afternoon (4-5 PM) and was seated instantly, with no problem. The server waited until all of us trickled in before taking orders, but not before getting us water. Since we came in at a good time, we were able to order from the happy hour menu, which had decent (for Vegas) pricing on rolls and sake. 

I had an order of hot sake and ate my fill of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, and a few mixed rolls I ate for fun, though I'm sure the sushi chef rolled his eyes at all the rainbow rolls we ordered. The fish tasted fresh and was delicious, with fatty cuts of tuna and excellently-made sticky rice.

5244503,2009-03-15,2,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"It has been a long time since I have had this bad of a meal. 

I absolutely love sushi and am usually willing to give most places a try. Ra seemed promising...it was full of people, dimly lit, bumpin top 40 tunes. I was by myself and requested to sit at the sushi bar. I figured that it would surely be faster to sit at the bar then a table...boy was I wrong. 

When I gave the sushi chef my menu of selections, he informed me that it would be at least 30 minutes before I got my first order. What?!?! Yes, the place was kind of busy, but not packed, and there were at least 4 sushi chefs behind the counter.

So I figured that I would order some miso soup and vegetable tempura appetizer to kill some time. The soup was good, kind of hard to screw that up. The tempura on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. They gave me about 10 pieces, 8 of which were asparagus and broccoli. Come on! I want some sweet potato, regular potato, green beans....anything but a plate of broccoli! Broccoli never tempura's well because the batter gets in the crevices and never really cooks, but stays raw. Utterly disgusting. The tempura dipping sauce had absolutely no flavor at all and added nothing to the flavor of the dish. 

About 30-minutes later and on cue, my sushi began to filter in. First I was given my rainbow roll. The diameter of this roll was a little larger than the size of a quarter. It was cut into 8 pieces and consumed in about 20 seconds. Next, I was given my tuna. The tuna was mushy and the rice fell apart on almost every piece. I am no sushi virgin and know full well how to use chop sticks...this rice was horrible. 10 minutes later I was given my yellowtail. Again, it was mushy and the rice fell apart. Some time later my salmon arrived and it was the same story. I had to ask for ginger and wasabi, as they were not just provided to me. 

I saw my server maybe twice and not only did my glass of water sit empty for nearly 20 minutes at a time, but my plates began to stack up next to me. 

The sushi chef wouldn't even give patrons the time of day and seemed as though we were bugging him every time we wished to place an order. Look, at nearly $6.00  for two pieces of tuna sushi, the food better be pristine! And the service impeccable! 

The menu comes with a disclaimer that good sushi takes a while to prepare, so if you can't wait, then you basically should leave. Um, no. Good sushi does not take 30-minutes to prepare. Sushi was designed to be Japanese fast food, analogous to the western European sandwich. If you are going to pose as a sushi elitist restaurant, then at least go all the way. I expect to not have wooden chop sticks that splinter and I would like my sushi to be served in the correct order, from light fish to dark. 

All in all, the service sucked and the food was blah. I'm done with this rant. That's how much I hate this place. If no star was an option, I would have picked that!",EHjp3-183IXI-sC0yluZwg,3,2,1,u-Yhf1nfM922HaolGGSGXw

RA is a chain found of sushi bars found in 7 States with 25 locations. I am familiar with RA from my local RA located in Huntington Beach.

The restaurants are all decorated about the same... Large red ""Chinese lantern inspired"" glass orbs (dim) lighting mixed with simple, but tasteful traditional Japanese/Asian decor. It is not a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant, but sometimes that is okay.

The service is good, considering how crazy busy this place gets... But, most importantly... The sushi is consistently fresh and tasty. Don't be fooled by the fact that this restaurant is located at the Fashion Show Mall, this is definitely not a ""food-court"" experience.

We ended up sharing a bento box and a few pieces of nigiri sushi. Bento was teriyaki chicken and I judge a place on how well they can make an easy dish (because, seriously, how can anyone screw that up?) 

Thankfully chicken was right. I couldn't eat the gyozas because they had pork in them. :( If I recall correctly you can't substitute either so that was a bummer for me.

       - Food - The food was average at best with the exception of the spicy sesame chicken wings.
       - Ambiance - You're definitely paying for the hip/club feel at this place. Everyone there seemed to be dressed for a night on the town and it was only 6pm when we went.
       - Price - The happy hour pricing seemed to me like what I'd pay regularly at other places for the same quality/portions.
**Price**
       - Happy Hour Mon-Sat from 3pm to 7pm.
**Ordered**

       - $3 Salmon Nigiri  - The salmon seemed like it was cut and left there for a while. It was completely dry by the time it got to the table.
       - $5 Spicy Sesame Chicken Wings - The only thing we ordered that actually seemed worth it. You get about 6 tangy and delicious wings/drum sticks.
       - $6 Rainbow Roll - The assorted fish on the roll was cut nearly paper thin.
       - $7 Viva Las Vegas Roll - The roll was good, but for five pieces, it didn't seem very happy hourish to me.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place for the food. If you're coming here, it's probably for the ambiance.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,3,X5e70vw-bcXCzcLvDk1VHw

It was good nonetheless, but for some reason I dont remember what it was haha. Since I'm not a big fan of sushi, I decided to be American and order this noodle dish haha it was really gooood!

They have dishes from $2-$7 and drinks from $4-$8. The service was spectacular for what we were looking for. Our waitress came around to take orders, clear plates, and then read the cues as to when to leave us alone. We were able to study and eat at the same time. 

The ""RA-cking"" Shrimp and the short ribs are the way to go. The shrimp comes in a generous portion, crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside. The dipping sauce is pure liquid crack. It goes well with everything. The rest of the items tend to be less imaginative or special. 

I tend to be conflicted with the idea of happy hours at sushi restaurants. A part of me would rather just go to an AYCE restaurant and have a larger selection, but RA was a good option for a more quiet place to sit back.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,1,3,AyfVS2wtHv9nnkyY99RhfQ

Hip... rockin... and good food.

Ate here with some friends and business associate.  The sushi was decent/good, the other menu items were also both intriguing and delightful.  

A nice selection of Saki's and beer.

Only complaints are 1.) as much as I like hip, when I feel like being hip, the music was too loud to hear the person across from me... as well he was playing all rasta beats... loud rasta music and sushi equals not so much good deal. 2.)  Sushi selection was lackluster, all the basics, but none of the best.

First, the happy hour is the best which is on Monday thru Saturday 4-7 and then on Sunday from 8-11. Awesome sushi and drinks which are usually half off, but recently they have changed their happy hour menu. I've always had a great time coming here with friends for a quick bite while at Fashion Show, but the service the last  three times was extremely slow. Once, the girl forgot our cocktails but we asked about them after we received our food and the girl was clueless. It felt like years before the server came back to ask if we wanted anymore food or drinks, by then I was rather upset and got the check instead. Either RA needs to provide more staffing or figure out a way to make service move a bit faster. 

Overall, I can't complain about this place. $2 Edamame and $5 Tootsie Maki rolls will eventually make me want to go back.",jy4_WUoDZKynQCqn4LitxQ,0,0,3,jDaIcZfkALm7GsBnglTZeQ

It's a louder, more upbeat sushi bar....a little more swanky and the decor a little more modern, since it is on the strip.  So for ambiance, especially for a bachelorette party...I think it fits the bill.  The food however is not good for the price you are paying.  I ordered the sesame garlic chicken wings...and it was just salty on the outside without any real flavor to the chicken and most chicken wings have a nice crunch on the outside.  I also ordered the sashimi dinner combo with tuna/albacore/salmon/yellowtail.  While the portion is decent....the fish is not fresh....it was hard to eat the tuna/albacore/yellowtail because of how fishy it tasted.  The salmon was decent, but again there is definitely better sushi just down the road on spring mountain.  They do have happy hour, so I say if you want to give this place a try...come during happy hour to test the waters instead of paying full price for mediocre food.  The service was also lack luster, we all got our food at random times and we repeatedly had to ask if our food was still coming.

We had big plans for dinner so I wanted something close, not outrageously priced but it had to be sushi. Enter RA Sushi Happy Hour! 

They make their miso soup in house- honestly they had me at that. It was very good.

Aaron, our server, was hilarious & attentive. I had the sense he was practicing his standup; either way good combo in a server. 

We ate inside as Vegas was very windy this trip but the outside patio looked cool, right out onto the strip but I had the sense it maybe a bit loud. 

We had a table near the sushi bar which had a better feel than I expected. The Sushi likewise exceeded our expectations, especially given we were ordering Happy Hour items. 
Loved the shishito peppers. They're always reliable. The garlic ponzu yellowtail was a major highlight. We devoured that pretty swiftly so it's the near empty plate in the photos. Served more like sashimi with no rice & a mild glaze, it was very good. We went out own way for rolls, not ordering the standard house recommendations bc there were other good things on the menu we'd rather try.

Upon entering Ra Sushi, we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess whom quickly gave us a view and summary of our seating options, a more formal area in the back, casual up front, the full bar with televisions, the sushi bar, or at a high top counter that runs the length of the restaurant facing Las Vegas Blvd.
My wife ordered their Blushing Geisha for $8 I Samurai Cowboy,also $8.
Ra Sushi offered up the usual sushi fare, Nigiri, Sashimi, Maki and speciality rolls ranging in price from $2 for QUAIL EGG ""UZURA"", to $17 for a King Crab Roll. Interested in trying their sushi, and interested in the quality of food with such reasonably priced dining on the strip, I decided to order one of their lunch specials which run from 11 am - 3 pm daily. The BARA CHIRASHI BOWL for $10.75 is served with miso soup & uchi no salad tuna. The soup was served first, the scallions still retained some of their crunch and the soy was firm, which led me to believe the soup was made fresh for me today. The uchi no salad never made it to the table, but sitting at the floor to ceiling opening on the strip located directly across from Wynn Resort & Casino, provided me with so much to see, that I honestly forgot it was a part of my meal and though missing, I never asked. The Bara Chirashi Bowl was large and plentiful containing salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, avocado & cucumber with Asian green vegetables, mixed with poki sauce; served over rice. Chilled, filling, no shortage of sushi, I will definitely order again.
My wife ordered an UCHI NO SALAD for $5 containing mixed greens tossed in a soy ginger vinaigrette which arrived with my soup. The salad was a good portion yet not overwhelming so. The greens were fresh, and the ingredients in the vinaigrette complimented each other nicely. She also ordered an appetizer as an entrée. The LOBSTER SPRING ROLLS for $11.75 contained lobster mixed with mango, cream cheese & mild peppers, wrapped in wonton paper & lightly fried; served with a mango sauce. Unfortunately, after the salad and soup were cleared, my lunch bowl arrived, and my wife's lobster rolls had not. We assumed, that for some reason, the server was making two trips, but they were not. We did not wait long before the waitress checked in, surprised and apologetic with regards to our missing food, she promised to have it out right away. The Lobster Spring Rolls did make it to our table fairly quickly. The rolls were delicious. And though we were friendly, and beyond asking for our food, truly did not complain at all, our waitress informed us that her manager did not charge us for the lobster and asked if there were anything else she could do for us.
Lunch for two adults looking over the Las Vegas Strip, on the strip, including soup, salad, two fun cocktails, and just a little confusion mixed in with friendly fast service cost us just $40 including tip. The confusion saved us $12.
The Las Vegas Strip contains many, many places to eat, and it runs 4 miles long. That being said, if you find yourself at the Fashion Show mall, or any where close by, Ra Sushi is a wonderful, affordable place to eat, and I will definitely be dining there again.",-BzMrzfDlxPP1s2AAU8KCw,2,0,4,5VMMQjjOINeXMK3SYyyhfA

We were sat in a comfortable booth and promptly greeted by our server. I forget her name but she was nice. 

Whenever my cousins and I go out to eat, we EAT. By this I mean, our eyes were definitely hungrier than our stomachs. 

We ordered all types of food, from the small plates (albacore onion or something or another, tuna salsa, a micro green salad of some sort, seaweed salad) which were ALL DELICIOUS, to a chicken bowl and sushi. We also ordered some sushi rolls which were bland and tasteless and obviously not their specialty. One of my cousins also ordered the sesame chicken, which we did not even touch. 

We did order 3 of the Chirashi bowls. Oh boy, HAND DOWN, my favorite sushi thing EVER!!! It wasn't your typical chirashi bowl with sushi rice topped with sashimi. There was an amazing vinaigrette, tangy and complimented the fresh fish, and wakame (seaweed salad) throughout.

The server brought out the wrong roll and was strongly trying to get us to give in and just eat the wrong roll. I hate when restaurants get things wrong and then try to have you accept their mistake. We ordered the lobster shrimp roll because after having salmon sashimi we didn't want to have more salmon. I refused and they made us the roll we had actually ordered. 

The food is ok. It's a somewhat low priced sushi place and that's the quality you get. The salmon sashimi was really cold as though it had been frozen and didn't quite defrost and the cut roll portion size was kind of small. Eh.",es8RRHuGV2ScrnIKvYfXcA,0,0,2,6FpM1q6tnIMXCrvMgSTGGA

I was right about the great sushi part because it was actually delicious, but that does not outweigh our TERRIBLE service that we had.

The night started out fine and it seemed like our server had 15 girls under control. We ordered drinks/apps first, then entrees. Everyone's food came out randomly which is fine, but he completely forgot to bring out the bride's order... yikes. He seemed to get more gradually annoyed at us, but I guess we were a big group. You'd think they would be used to bigger groups in Vegas though. So after everyone was eating for a while, he finally brought out the bride's entree and proceeded to charge her for that, which I didn't agree with.

Then comes the good part... when the check came, he put it all on ONE check. This would take forever to try and figure out, so we asked for him to split it in separate checks. I'm not kidding when I say his exact words were ""I don't have time to sit and split the check for everyone because it would take too long, and I know me and all of you have things to do and places to go"" - I mean not exact, but that's basically what he said. EXTREMELY RUDE. So guess what. We sat there for almost 45 minutes trying to split that freaking check, when we had places to be and bachelorette plans at night. He kept ignoring our table after that and avoiding us. We asked to see a manager, and his response was ""why do you want to see my manager"" ... are you kidding? The bride's mom and her friends did not let anything sit, so they were talking to our server, then finally the manager... I'm not sure how anything got resolved. So after all of that chaotic mess, we ended up putting it on one bill and giving cash/paying by Venmo, which was still a mess. What a disaster.

This was probably one of the worst service and dining experience I've ever had, and I think that most/all of the girls would also agree. DO NOT go here in big groups, and don't expect good service.

Kind of tacky to me.  The set up is kind of odd too, I thought it was weird how the bar was sorta isolated from the restaurant, but i suppose it would be nice to sit at on a sunny day when people are dining in their outside patio.  Anyway, my BF and I were seated promptly along side a somewhat booth area on the other side of the sushi bar, right behind the bar.  The hostess was pretty nice; she told us we were able to sit wherever we liked- i'm a big fan of this option.

Their happy hour just started when we got there (4pm) so we ordered a few things on there.  $2 edemame was fine- not something you can easily mess up.  We also got a spicy yellowtail cut roll- this was alright; it wasn't bad or good- and some nigiri pieces.  From the regular menu we ordered salmon sashimi and some type of yellowtail dish served on a ginger/ponzu sauce or something like that.  The nigiri seriously looked like it was made by one of those buffet sushi machines and lacked any sushi chef skills whatsoever.  It also looked like it wasn't made to order.  My salmon sashimi was a horrible dish!!  I believe it was $9.50 for seven pieces of butchered ass cut sashimi.  OMG, the pieces were a sorry excuse for sashimi and I can't believed they served something like that.  Whoever cut them obviously lacked skill with the knife and is not a sushi chef.  I could've done a better job with a butter-knife.  Because of this horrible craftsmanship and  the not so fresh taste, i chose not to eat it and the waitress took it away.  The yellowtail dish was no different as far as cut was concerned, but it was masked by all the greens it was topped with.  The taste of the fish was edible, but i'm sure it  was because of the citrus sauce.

Service was ok.  It was a rather slow afternoon and things were mellow.  I don't know how busy this place gets, as it was my first time, but since it was slow our server was pretty attentive and made some suggestions.  I don't know if I would come back here, especially with all the other options in Vegas.  The prices are not bad for a strip restaurant, but you can definitely go off strip and find better quality/priced Japanese joints.  Though, I feel like I should maybe give them one more chance because I didn't really order any of their specialty/original dishes.  If i do come back, i'm definitely not opting for their sushi.

*Happy hour seems like it was a definite steal.  A lot of their appetizers, small plates, rolls, and nigiri were half price.  If you like to drink sake and martinis and such they have a pretty killer happy hour for that, too.  Cheers.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,0,0,2,hTRbAlVjy8H3wgJ5BfFwgQ

**The Menu
Sushi, plus an assortment of other dishes: teriyaki, noodles, katsu. The sushi emphasis is on rolls with all sorts of stuff mixed in. How about a Viva Las Vegas roll: an artificial crab and cream cheese roll, battered and fried, then topped with spicy tuna, crab mix, and lotus root, THEN topped with bbq sauce and fried spinach flakes.

**The Atmosphere
The design is simple, with lots of light wood and a black industrial ceiling. Light is provided by a number of blood red globes. Music, at a moderate volume, consisted mostly of blues and rock.

The sushi bar is poorly designed. While the sushi chefs try to be friendly, the bar is so deep that it was difficult to be heard over the music. I view this as a major flaw.

**The Meal
Since this was my first meal here, I opted for some basic sushi choices. They all suffered from a basic flaw: rice that was too soft, and lacked flavor. Not a good start. Now, on to the particulars:

    * hamachi (yellowtail). The fish was fresh enough but, even given the mild nature of hamachi, was bland.
    * unagi (barbecued eel): The eel was barely warm. The sauce was watery.
    * flying fish roe with a quail egg: Good. The rich egg flavor and the crunchy roe made the rice's deficiencies less important.
    * amaebi (raw sweet shrimp): The shrimp were fresh enough, but lacked flavor. On request, the heads are fried. No tempura batter was used, which I thought odd but not bad. The heads were crisp, but overcooked and somewhat dry. Nonetheless, RA Sushi get points for even offering this selection.

**Summary
The sushi was very disappointing. Go for the atmosphere. Maybe the more exotic rolls are good. Just don't go for regular sushi.

**The Bill
The meal was $44, plus tax and tip.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,0,2,XoWR_pKkCZrmFDLDkMocow

Sat at the bar to avoid waiting and to feel the breeze from outside.  It was dirty, and no one bothered to wipe it down.  By the time our food came we were the only ones left seated at the bar, and we were pretty much left to fend for ourselves.  We managed to waive down our server/ bartender to get a fourth plate for our group of four, but had to scavenge for soy sauce dispensers that weren't empty.  Add a crab roll being brought instead of the nigiri we ordered (they did end up charging us for the nigiri instead of the roll, but we had to point out the discrepancy, and still didn't get what we'd actually ordered).

Potstickers were very good.  Salmon was pretty good, as was whatever roll was basically a Philly roll with avocado and mango sauce on top.  Crab roll was OK but had lots of rice- nigiri would have been better to taste it.  I don't recommend the mango sauce on rolls without avocado- it just seemed too sweet to me, but my friend liked it so if you like sweet sushi then it'd be good.

The chicken teriyaki resembled chicken teriyaki in that it was chicken in a brown sauce, but all similarities ended there. Somehow they find a way to make the actual chicken both rubbery and soggy, which is mystifying in its own right.

I waited a few minutes and because at this point I'm running out of time for lunch I asked if they could hurry and I just want to be seated and eat in.

I look over again and the other girl at the bar gives me a dirty look. Finally the waitress gives us our food and never comes by again. I did not leave a tip and I'm never going back again.

I got the salmon rice bowl, it was a bunch of salmon sashimi with rice, cucumbers, and a really delicious sauce. I loved it so much and it got full with leftovers, since it's raw fish and I don't trust leaving it in the hotel, it just sucks I can't take it to go unless I eat it quickly *sad face. That first time I got it, it was from the lunch menu, but when I came back a few months later luckily they said they were able to make me it for dinner. Weird how it's something on the lunch menu and not on the dinner though? And when I asked if I still got the miso soup (included on the lunch menu) the second time I came, the waitress told me it shouldn't come with it because at the time it was dinner hours... but it's not on the dinner menu whatsoever, it's on the lunch. I don't know how to explain it. It was just odd to me that whole situation. I told her ""oh okay then."" Yet she still came back with it after her lowkey attitude for asking.

As for service, the first time I came the waitress I had was very sweet and super attentive. I got everything I needed to enjoy my meal before heading out to EDC that evening. The second time, I was kind of disappointed because our server literally took a very long time to take our order, to get us water... and when I needed something she was nowhere to be found, for such a long period of time my boyfriend had to ask the busser next to us to get us a side of spicy mayo (thanks dude!). That second server was probably annoyed of me asking for that miso soup earlier lol. I don't even think she was busy because the place was pretty empty when I came in. I will still return hoping to receive the service I got the very first time, hopefully they have less snobby servers in the near future. Otherwise I don't think I can handle it. I would probably just want to take it to go back to my hotel to eat it instead just to avoid having attitude on the side with my meal haha.",NIZ8FXId2xJJl-n96plJuA,1,1,4,mXjefmvoLsP1bP1aCsi6Vg

On the happy hour menu: $2 sake and around $4-$8 for rolls, sashimi and other appetizers. The rolls aren't that great. I will tell you what is because I'm a heffa like that and tried just about everything on the happy hour menu. 

Get multiple orders of the sesame wings. That was the favorite dish at our table. Big, succulent wings that were a little crispy just how I like them. And that sesame sauce was so good we took some to go with our leftovers. Another favorite was the fried shrimp, calamari and albacore sashimi. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was just ok. I would also forgo the short ribs. They were NOT good.

Sweet Onion Salmon: salmon was cut thinly, but pretty good with sauce
Lobster Spring Rolls: only 3, super crunchy, but couldnt taste much of the mango
Calamari: not too memorable , but filling
Viva Las Vegas Roll: typical sushi roll, average, but the plating was gorgeous

All of these dishes were reasonably priced (considering vegas $$), and the food came out fast and hot. Waitress came back to check up on us a lot and gave us boxes to take things to go for our friends.

5979639,2015-05-02,7,R3TC2oq8fQK9c9BNMZ-ynA,"Living in the middle of the desert.. Las Vegas to be exact.. you learn very quicky that there are 5 star sushi joints. And those are the ones you need to go to. I love RA Sushi, and the Las Vegas location(service-wise) wasn't all that when I lived there, and it wasn't all that when we paid a visit in the middle of March, but it's fresh (^_^) I honestly thought it was so-so when I lived here..but 3 years later.. there seemed to be an improvement! 

Let's get down to it. RA is located within the Fashion Mall at the end of the ""new"" Strip (Spring Mountain Rd and S Las Vegas Blvd, across from the Wynn & Encode hotels). Therefore it can either be really crowded or really empty. Frankly, it's usually in between..during weekends there is usually some sort of music being played at the bar, and it reverberates through the ENTIRE restaurant. Meaning diners have to listen to he latest hip hop or whatever the DJ is playing. Great if it's a younger crowd, not so much if it's full of older folks (and yes, age varies by day and time too!). Parking can be found behind the Fashion Mall in an underground garage. It's pretty spacious down there, but people drive like morons so watch out! The ambience of RA is..bathed in an annoying red light. Okay, at first I thought ""OMG how cool..."" and then when I tried to read the menu, AND take photos of my food. I had to enlist the help of my flash to get clear photos!! It's he lighting I'd expect of I was going on a date to a restaurant I guess. 

The bar has plenty of alcohol to whip up numerous drinks, and oh so many sakes, wines, bottled beers and . Because sushi and sake bombs, it goes hand in hand. I'm quite the picky eater when it comes to sushi, as it is raw fish, so better safe than sorry right? At least RA has fresh fishies on my plate! RA has 5 types of sushi. Maki, Sashimi, Nigiri, and then hand rolls and specialty rolls (only found at RA locations). Personally, I prefer the specialty rolls and their Maki choices. The shrimp tempura hand roll has a lovely crunch, and fresh chunks of shrimp inside.

When browsing the menu, I usually go for what I know. My 1st time eating here was back in 2010 when I first moved to Nevada, and I was still relatively ""new"" to sushi. Now it's a staple. The latest trip provided me with 3 or 4 different rolls. I chose the Vegas Roll, Rainbow Roll, Avocado and Cucumber Rolls, and the garlic edamame. The Vegas rolls were fresh, full of crab and cream cheese mix that played up the crab flavor and wasn't overly strong from the cream cheese.  The tempura decoration on top was tasty too haha. The avocado and cucumber rolls were both fresh, but the chunk of cucumber where difficult to bite through because they were pretty thick..not to mention I still had to get through the layer of rice..not an easy roll to eat in just one bite :(. California roll is standard at ANY sushi place, and just like any other sushi place..it tasted just like every other Cali roll I've had. But, plenty of crab! The slices of fish adorning my Rainbow rolls were fantastic. I'm leary of Rainbows because the fresh fish slices, but the chef came out and reassured me that the fish had been delivered earlier that morning and had the slip to prove it. Can't get much fresher than that..especially when ya know..there's not ocean for a good 300+ miles haha. This particular Rainbow Roll is only found at RA, and while I've seen them elsewhere, the amount of crab meat within the roll, makes it a far better one! I enjoyed my choices, but would probably pass on cucumber rolls again, and maybe the Cali rolls too, just to open up spots for new choices (^_^)

Service varies by day, time, and crowd. I came here many times living here, and I had good and bad service from the hostess, to the chef. The chefs are almost always fab, but there was one guy who was just snotty. Didn't see him in March, so maybe he's gone? Anywho, going around peak feeding hours or happy hour seems to generate a few cranky employers, just because it gets so darn busy! Lunch is usually better! Also, sign up for the RA newsletter and get a coupon for a half birthday discount, and plenty of deals that change weekly! I've definitely taken advantage of the half birthday deal, and it was worth it IMO. 

RA is a good sushi joint on the Strip, but if you know some locals, hit them up. They have the good ones hidden up their sleeves(^_~), but if not, RA will do the trick if you're wanting sushi and can't drive because you spent the day drinking. I mean, I did give it 4 stars. Service is why it's not a 5. (^_^)",MAYg7YwA-bFhZqphq33UDg,9,8,4,WvbtYw7WyiFUQ3VA54rUKQ
