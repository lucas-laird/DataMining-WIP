They were funny, they were helpful (telling us what the ""book"" says to do), joking around and just being cool.  There was this cool guy from Nicaragua who was like a cool Spanish Bluto.  We had a funny lady from Vietnam.  She realized we were giving our friend a hard time so when he busted she jumped in and gave him a hard time too which increased her tip from the rest of us.  They also played good tunes, classic rock, 80's and just a good assortment.  We stayed at the Mandalay Bay (which was very nice and fairly priced) but did not gamble there because their dealers had 0 personality.  The dealers at Caesars are pretty hot but do not exhibit any personality which might be deliberate.

Dear Management, continue to instruct your dealers to have fun and rock it out.

P.S.  Rap and hip-hop?  Don't even think about it because in the long run you'll drive off the lion's share of your paying customer/gambler base.",5Wi2W2T2sUkuUHBI5Tcc3g,0,0,4,pgSc3PfCZE3nRdrx_Rn2ug

I was still pretty new to the game of craps when we went but they had no problem showing me the game, helping me out, and joking around. Really quick drink service too. 
The 5 o'clock somewhere bar was great. They have a ""reverse happy hour"" which was really cool. We had trouble adjusting to the time zone change (we're from the east coast) so we'd wake up every morning at 4 or 5am! We'd just head down to the bar, get some $5 margaritas during happy hour, and play some craps before the table got too busy. It was great! 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lack of the type of table games I like. It looked like they had plenty of blackjack tables, but only 1 roulette table and 1 craps table. There were a few times when I wanted to play but couldn't because the ONE table was full. 
Still, it was a great time. We'll be back to Vegas in May 2013 for our honeymoon and plan to stay at the Flamingo so we can spend more time at the Margaritaville casino and 5 o'clock somewhere bar!  :)",GD_7gP_b1k7Df-36V86aiA,0,0,4,V_tXwRvdOa1U86FvpF9LEQ

Of course, for suckers like me who's blood flows like hot Volcano Nacho lava, I was assured I was going to win at the Margaritaville Casino because of all the Margaritaville/Buffett references and memorabilia.  So, I threw down $20 on the roulette table and won about $130 and I was convinced that Jimmy Buffett is indeed a holy man.  You'd have to be a parrothead to believe that so don't ask.  But anyways, I lost it all right away again and decided to sit at the outside bar attached to the casino and drink the ""Who's To Blame"" margaritas and just watch other people gamble and walk down the strip.  Anyways, awesome little addition to Margaritaville Las Vegas.",BXSUe6os4jS7lNQGyo77ow,1,1,5,sgREq288CpEIE9BDTEvttg

Score! It was packed with Parrot Heads and just a ton of fun! Coming back a few months later, it was still a blast. We grabbed a seat at the bar and had a killer time chatting up with the bartender and watching him do tricks while making our drinks. Tons of drinks to choose from, laid back island vibe which is a plus in Vegas! It took us back to our vacation in the Caribbean! We'll definitely be back.",gfY-BGAJMINto1WK8w6orw,0,0,4,KNQtPsgsPQv1NyhUz2p7Ww

I love how they have converted and renovated this place to be a nice new casino. It's attached right next to the Flamingo and in a great spot on the strip. When I was staying at the Flamingo for a convention recently I was able to drop in a few times to check it out and play some blackjack. Ended up having a great time! Friendly dealers and bartenders. $5 and $10 blackjack tables! Low table limits! 

The whole place feels upbeat and had terrific rock music playing along with the prerequisite Jimmy Buffet tunes. When I was walking through it seemed so laid back, with a tropical decor, bright colors, cheery, chill and relaxing. Seemed everyone who worked there said hello and had a smile on their face. Had no problem getting drinks as cocktail waitresses were always coming by and they are served up by cuties in bikinis! Even the crowd gambling here seemed more happy than at other casinos.

One thing I did notice is that this casino is on the smaller side, with a nice selection of the newest slot machines to go along with the standard table games, but not that many of them. It's a great spot to drop in to have a few drinks, gamble a bit, and begin your night of carousing. They even still have the outside balcony area overlooking the strip that you can drink on and people watch and make catcalls to the sexy ladies and gents passing by. 

Even if you are a parrot head or not then definitely check this place out if in Vegas.  The Margaritaville Casino is a fun time!",YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,6,6,4,EYTJF9pvmHx80cdhc1ROqw

It has the feel of a laid back, tropical, relaxing place... much like back home, except you can gamble! It's nice to walk into this casino, right from the strip and it's searing heat, have a cold beer and hit the crap tables! Then, if you aren't having any luck on the tables, you can always sit at the bar, strike up a conversation with the friendly bartenders and play your favorite video poker games! Friendly staff and you feel comfortable here, not like you're not wanted if you don't gamble. I'm coming back next trip!!",e-sQ7oGQElAaaE5OH6b55g,6,5,4,313-2IAPbda1fWAuzNYtdQ

The big downside is that it's a very small casino so it can get really hard to find a spot to play blackjack or craps, especially if you don't get there right after they open. It's worth waiting around though if you prefer cheap table because they aren't easy to come by, especially at night.

I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan/Parrot Head, and coming to Vegas for the first time, I was very excited to play at the Margaritaville Casino inside of the Flamingo. I have to say though, it was better than I expected. 

My sister, brother-in law and fiancee are not the biggest Jimmy Buffett fans by any means, and even they enjoyed their experience here. 

I am a blackjack player, but I by no means have the bankroll to play the higher minimum tables (15-25$) found at most other blackjack tables on the strip. At this casino, there was always a $5.00 minimum table, which was a great change of pace to play at my favorite venue. The blackjack is 6-5 (only bad part) but is played out of a shoe instead of a continuous shuffler. 

I played blackjack for several hours with a great crowd of players, and did not lose money here, in fact I won. The bar service was spot-on, some of the best we experienced in vegas. Waitresses came by frequently and served more drinks. At one point I was being served faster than I could drink the three beers in front of me. We had great dealers that talked to us and entertained us further while we played. 

I played at several other casinos such as the Hard Rock (also a great experience), the Aria, Mandalay Bay, Planet Hollywood, and the Bellagio to name a few. Margaritaville was my favorite experience of them all. 

I am not a HUGE fan of the rest of the Flamingo, but loved the time I spent at this casino. It was everything I hoped for and so much more. I would be willing to stay at the Flamingo during a future visit just to play more at this casino.",RnHJ2SsCHNEAxXV56yiU1A,2,0,5,_vJT5IPc_t78MX9Klp6cAA
