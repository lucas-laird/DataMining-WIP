I normally get a #13 on wheat bread, Mike's way (sans the red wine vinegar) and it is such a great combination. 

One of the beauties of Jersey Mike's is the amount of meat they put on your sandwich. Other places tend to be a little stingy, but I'd say you get your money's worth here!

They also have hot sandwiches such as Philly cheesesteaks, which are great too. 

They offer 3 different sizes for most sandwiches (mini, regular and giant). The mini is definitely good for kids and a quick snack, the regular is more comparable to a 6-8 inch sandwich, while the giant is worth it for those with a big appetite or those wanting to share.",X6sVuBNrwkn8_R-qt9lYIg,0,0,4,IaTRcXBFtNXktJc4CbKMLg

Food: As noted, while they have a couple of fun subs like the Big Kahuna Cheese Steak, I feel that they hold it down when it comes to a more ""traditional"" approach with their subs: good bread, quality meat and simple ingredients. That's not to say that traditional is bad. Other sandwich spots have their angle. Jersey Mike's just puts a product that stands more on keeping to simple ingredients of quality than venturing into the hit-or-miss territory of inventive subs.

Staff: I have been here plenty of times (many of times I even forget to check in....I get sub-sandwich-tunnel-vision) and I have never had a bad experience with the staff. They are professional but they are also fun and talkative; they do not go into that mechanical sandwich-making auto pilot mode you see at other spots. Also, while it looks like chaos at times, they are very good at assembling multiple subs at once (when I go...it's usually for picking up an office order so it's usually 4-8 subs).

Facilities: I usually take my food to-go but their facilities are always clean. Additionally, all of the location I have been to have had plenty of seating.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,1,0,5,e89XDfOMjm08YLlQbA8tkQ

2741700,2013-10-14,4,tkdolOWoZ9KIYP-PETvYWA,"Jersey Mike's Subs are one those few sandwich places that I don't mind going to every so often. One of the main reasons why is that they only had 3 locations in the Vegas area. With this being the fourth one that just opened up only makes the percentages of me having a JM sandwich even higher.

This day I had a regular size ""Big Kahuna"" on wheat bread. It's a Philly Cheesesteak with Onions, Mushrooms, Peppers, and Jalapenos. It tasted how a Philly should taste like. The only thing I that kind of bothered me was that I wanted it with extra onions but when I got my sandwich, there was hardly any at all. Since I had time constraints for lunch and there was a long line, I just let it go. Hopefully next time they get it right.

Their cold sandwiches are also very good. If you are not sure what to get, I recommend the #9 Club Supreme. It has Roast Beef, Turkey, Swiss, Bacon, Mayo, and topped off with Mike's Way. What is Mike's Way you ask? Well on all the cold subs, if you want all the fixins' you say what cold sandwich you want and say you want it Mike's Way which is Onions, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Spices, and ""The Juice"" (red wine vinegar and olive oil blend).

Their location is one of many eating establishments all clustered together in front of the South Premium Outlet Shopping Mall and right next to Las Vegas Blvd on the east side.

Service is efficient for they have an assembly line style of sandwich making. I notice they have one person constantly making sure all the tables are nice and clean.

The only negatives that I can say are that the parking is limited especially during lunch and dinner rushes. They said they have free WiFi but is not set up yet. You think that would be ready when they first opened.

There's a large variety of cold and hot subs; with a choice of wheat bread or on a white roll.

Grilled peppers, onions, steak and melted cheese served ""Mike's Way"" (oil, spices, wine dressing and no mayo) were delicious and just under 800 calories (I was craving a heavier meal since I was pretty hungry). A bit of a messy meal and no seats (take out only) make this meal a bit challenging to consume, but no real problems.

Regular jersey mikes fare, though only one size sandwich available (regular 7"") and possibly missing some options. Also I think more expensive than normal.

In case you're not familiar with this suburban chain, it's a decent quality deli sandwich; order of magnitude better than subway. They also have a decent hot cheesesteak (beef or chicken).

My go to order is a #7 on wheat, mikes way plus spicy mustard. Mikes way definitely makes their sandwiches good, make sure to get it.",ujbLWpurrq1MQwMsn0n6wg,1,1,4,SkXVuDirL2xt3pJBOGxxnA
4063027,2018-05-16,19,tkdolOWoZ9KIYP-PETvYWA,"I probably should wait until I try this place out again before writing this review, but my first experience was so bad (food) that I'm not even sure I even want to give it another chance. Really sad since I've been wanting to try Jersey Mike's for a long time and when I finally get around to it, it was a letdown. 

Stopped by last weekend and my first impressions were great. The inside was very clean and organized. The floors were cleaned, tables wiped down, trash area clean, and the drink station was clean, organized and filled with all the necessities. As we entered we were greeted by the friendly ladies working behind the counter. The lady making the sandwiches gave suggestions and answered questions we had. 

Jersey Mike's offer Hot and Cold subs as well as wraps. They offer the subs in three different sizes Mini, Regular, and Giant. All cold subs include ""Mike's Way"", which is with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, red wine vinegar, olive oil blend, and spices. And you can choose between a plain, wheat, and tomato tortilla for your wrap. Add a small chip and a drink for $2.69 for a 22 oz or $2.89 for 32 oz drink. Their kid's meal is $4.49 and includes and drink and a cookie. 

My guest got the #13 - The original Italian regular sub. This comes with Provolone cheese, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. He made it ""Mike's Way"" minus the tomatoes and added Mayo. Cost $8.49. I decided on the Buffalo Chicken Signature wrap on a tomato basil wrap. It came with grilled chicken in a spicy buffalo sauce, melted American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and blue cheese dressing. This cost $7.99.

My problem with this place was how they made my wrap. They put so much lettuce and tomato into the wrap that she couldn't roll the wrap. Everything was busting out the ends and with all the sauce they added to it, my wrap was so soggy by the time I got to my table!! I picked it up and everything fell out of the wrap and they didn't have any forks for me to eat it with, so I ended up having to toss most of it. Very, very disappointed. Sure, I'm glad they give you plenty, but it was ridiculous how much they put in the wrap. If you can't close it, it's too much! On top of that, the ""Mike's Way"" with the vinegar and olive oil just added to the sogginess of the wrap. If I come back, I'll just stick to a sub and opt out of the ""Mike's Way"".",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,33,33,3,OlfaGkLhYGScW0XjC0e3TQ

I get the California club with no bacon an extra Turkey which is phenomenal. my friend gets the number 10 with provolone and that looks pretty amazing as well.

I would warn that if you're going to call ahead make sure you have your order ready and you're very clear about what you're looking to have ordered along with having them repeat back your order.

4540142,2018-05-31,3,tkdolOWoZ9KIYP-PETvYWA,"First time at a Jersey Mike's, the food which I will get into shortly was good but the staff had a lot to be desired.

My daughter order something in a bowl which is basically a sandwich without the bread on top of a salad.  They attempted to make what she asked for but kept forgetting ingredients which she had to tell them or ask as this was a nicer way to do it, ""isn't there supposed to be this and that on it and the response was always oh yea...."". Then the girl at the register asked if it was for here and to which we said yes, so she rang us up said thank you and moved on to the next customer.  We had to ask for a fork and knife to which she gave us a strange look, really???

From the time we walked in, ordered our food, sat down and ate our food, I was able to see the back of the place where the bathrooms were.  Being that there was no one in the place customer wise when we came in and even those who came after, no one went into the men's room yet the door was locked.  My nephew had to use the bathroom so I knocked on the door twice and there was no response.  So I went to the counter and asked if there was a key...I was told no it's open.  I explained that it was locked and I knocked several times and there was no answer.  Another lady very rudely said well if it is locked then that means someone is in there.  I explained that I find that hard to believe since I've been here for almost 15 minutes and no one went in or came out, that I knocked and got no answer.  She then replied rudely again, just go use the women's bathroom and we will figure it out later...

The food was really good and I will go to Jersey Mike's again, just not this location as the staff is not with it and are rude.  I would have easily given this place 4 stars maybe even 5 if the place was clean and the staff was not rude.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,9,3,3,PoN9tsBqEFtA_bl0fUoSDg
4875664,2018-05-16,1,tkdolOWoZ9KIYP-PETvYWA,"I'm a huge fan of Jimmy John's and Subway and had heard of this place many times and it's been on my list of sub places to try and I finally was able to come by last weekend. This location is located at the South Premium outlet Mall by Outback Steakhouse and Buffalo Wild Wings. 

As I entered I noticed how everything looked clean and in its proper place. The employees greeted me as I entered. Since this was my first time ever trying Jersey Mike's, I had to take a few minutes to look over the menu before deciding. On their menu, they show 3 different sizes, so I had to ask how big each of them were as they don't specify on the menu. I decided on the regular size. I got the #13 Original Italian and made it a combo with small chips and a medium drink. 

When you get a cold sub you can get it Mike's Way which is with lettuce, tomato, vinegar, oil, and herbs. I decided to try it Mike's way without the tomatoes. I'm used to how much vinegar and oil subway puts on their subs so I had no idea that Jersey Mike's just pours it on theirs. So, if you don't want a lot, I'd suggest you ask for ""light"" on the sauces. You can also get mayo and some other extras like jalapenos, peppercinis, pickles, etc. 

My sub was delicious with just the right amount of meat, cheese and veggies. However, I'll ask for light on the sauces next time. I wouldn't have been able to take any of my sub home for later cause the bread would've been soggy and gross.",zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A,0,0,4,naM-QttnBy2ro8QDQ2-ycA

I have eaten at Jersey Mike's in San Diego before. I didn't really think much of it. But my flight was delayed and this seemed to be the only place to grab a quick dinner at McCarran. 

Firstly, the bread lady ignored me and proceeded to take the order from her friend who was standing behind me. I get it I am tiny but I am not invisible!

I had to get the bread lady's attention and ordered the veggie sandwich. She proceeded to cut my bread without changing her gloves after cutting her friend's turkey/ham/monstrous piece of whatever meat. I didn't really say anything because I wasn't sure how Jersey Mike's works. 

Now the vegetable lady who has my bread goes ""Oh veggie, do you want me to change my gloves?"" I am like yes please! The bread lady hears this and smirks and she and her friend exchange knowing glances! 

What the hell bread lady! You knew you were supposed to change your gloves before making my order. Fine you probably forgot to. But you could have at least offered to switch my bread once you realized it. 

Also just realized the cheese goes through the same meat cutter! :X

Jersey Mike's has fewer options for bread, vegetables and sauces. And the sandwiches are not toasted. Yet Jersey Mike's is more expensive than Subway or Quiznos. How you stay in business is beyond me!

Zero for customer service and zero for taste. You should just call yourself Sub-Zero! :P
