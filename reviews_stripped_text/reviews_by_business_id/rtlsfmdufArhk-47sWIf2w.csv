The decor was charmingly romantic with soft pastel circus murals on the walls.  Even the whimsical dinnerware was unique and interesting.  And the food was simply wonderful.  Our meal began with a peanut soup which was followed by escargot that were tender and perfectly seasoned.  We selected breads , warm and flavorful,  from a tray brought to our table often.  Our entree of Sea Bass with potato crust was amazing.   I had a Grand Marnier soufflé and my husband had the banana soufflé.  The were puffy and light and tasted heavenly.   Every course was served with perfect timing so that there were no delays in the meal.

The service was attentive and friendly and the meal was simply delicious.

But the reason why I love Le Cirque and would recommend it is because I came back. The staff immediately spoke to me in my native French (as if I was just there the day before) and spoiled me with a little extra of my favorite delicacies (gougeres and toasted brioche). The foie gras au torchon is one of the best I've ever had, the lobster was great and our chocolate souffles were decorated especially for our 1st wedding anniversary.

The fact that the food is perfect is one thing, but it feels amazingly good to go back to such a friendly place. Whenever we are in Vegas, we know that Le Cirque will always be part of the trip.",OEb_kGar-vTTlP9_YY_P7g,1,1,5,qXPz-YzIs5gv5-enYumiAg
25937,2007-02-23,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"My foie gras was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  But long after I forget the taste, I will remember the path I took eating it.  You see, as the gentleman seated at the table next to us explains, the food at this restaurant is absolutely wonderful, but not the best in Vegas---you pay the  approx $110 per plate because of the presentation and the service.  Well said, my friend.  

Our path begins wandering through the strip trying to find a place to eat that suits our mood.  Unaware that we found a world class restaurant, we stumble into Le Cirque and ask if we could be seated.  ""In the parlor"" she says with her pleasantly but assertive French accent.  I am tempted to fall for the accent, but my mom is French, and I naturally rebel to that sound.  No merci, I say, we will try something else.  Mon dieu! a table for two somehow opened in the main restaurant.  I am not offended. Rather a bit proud, as if I passed a test..why must the French always test??  

The restaurant is aptly named.  The Bellagio fountains shooting off every now and then seen through the window are only background to the real show.  Under the tent is a hub-bub of activity with servers hustling here and there drawing laughs, suggesting wines, shaking hands, catering to whims..... You might suspect it to be noisy, but you are incorrect.  The decor is themed and consists pleasantly of soft orange and yellow and browns.     There must be a busy and jolly impressionist painting somewhere that is the inspiration.        

Back to the foie gras.  You start with the first bite, it melts.  As you make you way through the dish, each bite exposes a new series of tasty gems---oils , raisins, cranberries, nuts and different oils.  The fresh finish is a small tumble of clover.  

The wine, chosen by our server because we really have no idea how to choose from the hundred or so wines that range from $80 to several thousand dollars, smelled like roses. Oh no! we realize that we have not given ourselves enough time to fully enjoy this experience and make it to the 10:30 show.  ""Monsieur, I regret to inform you that I have some unpleasant news.. you see, we have tickets.""  ""Oui, of course, I will make it work, I promise.""  With a clap our new advocate chastises the nearest of the many staffers milling about---""where is their food---they have been waiting...  Do not worry my friends,""  Within minutes it is here.. my canard is in rich and flavorful medallions.  Not quite the foie gras, but excellent.   After two aperitifs each supplied, gratis, by you know who, the question of desert is our top issue.  One choice for something with chocolate and another for coconut.  She has made reference to the chocolate at least five times since we were there two days ago.  Mine was a fluffy creamy thing presented in a shell and provided a sweet surprise at the bottom.     We paid (ouch) and somehow made it to the show just as the music began!  

I suggest that your path finds its way to Le Cirque. It is not only a restaurant but a journey.",HBLzEv21iNOf23sLb7QpjQ,3,1,5,097l4glcqSNPoez0YIDMmg

I had really great sweetbread dish with morel mushrooms and thyme.  The duck is excellent and the desserts are fantastic.  My husband has  a poached meringue in vanilla ice cream sauce that was outstanding.  

I liked this place better than Alex.

   2. Snobby server who, for some reason, neglected us the whole night. What did we do to deserve that?!
   3. Whoever is responsible for my entree come out 45 min after I was done with my apps.
   4. Manager who, after listening to me, said I should have waived him down earlier to resolve the issues with the entrees and our server! Whaaaat?
    You guys have those five diamonds hanging on the wall, I shouldn't have to waive anyone down. Besides, i find it extremely rude. So we had $20 of our $400 bill taken care of. Please don't bother next time...Wait,there won't be next time! 
   By the way, make sure your servers know your menu because that Kobe filet is probably 4oz, not 8oz as I was told.
    A good thing I can say about that place is that the sommelier and food runner were amazing, both professional, funny and very attentive. They are the only reason I'm adding a star.

47477,2011-07-03,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Unexpected gem.  

We went for the pre-theatre menu expecting a good quick meal.  We knew it was a Michelin starred restaurant, but we recently dined at 2 3 stars, so we weren't expecting huge things.  

From the moment we arrived, service was impeccable.  While we started with tap water, our neighbors asked for San Pelligrino.  While they do not have San Pelligrino (they serve another type of sparkling water), they offered to go to other restaurants to find San Pelligrino if needed.  They also recognized diners for a few months ago, which I though was very nice.

Anyways, on to the food.  We did the pre-theatre menu. Our amuse bouche was a english pea soup and a croquete of something tasty but I do not recall the details. My husband had the beef tartare and I had the lobster bisque.  Both were perfect.  The beef tartare had a perfect mixture of beef and greens and they were paired perfectly with the lotus chips.  We did not even touch the accompanying toast because we did not need them.  The lobster bisque was lick-your-plate clean good.  

For our main courses we had the salmon and beef tenderloin.  The salmon was good, but the beef tenderloin was the star.  It was the best piece of meat we have had in several years.  It was perfectly medium rare.  When I cut it and saw the texture I almost cried from how beautiful it was (just kidding, but I imagine a steak lover somewhere would).  My husband sat around with a goofy grin for the next half hour because he was so happy from eating it.  

The dessert was so creative, BUT TASTY.  Some ""fancy"" restaurants make the mistake of being creative and weird tasting (I'm looking at you Le Meurice with your bee pollen dish aka assault on the tastebuds). One was a chocolate ball that came out in a beautiful globe that was promptly melted away by hot fudge to reveal vanilla ice cream and chocolate/hazelnut. As my husband put it ""a giant delicious ferraro rocher.""  I was presented with a coconut.  When the lid came off, I saw a sea of beautiful white foam.  It was COCONUT FOAM.  If you tasted just the foam itself, it was delicious!  But combined with the pineapple sorbet and the fruit hiding underneath... heavenly.

I like food, and my husband usually just comes along to these ""fancy"" restaurants to appease me, but this time he was also very happy.

yay for you, Le Cirque!",XN3Hx6Nu1NWYOhpN8SYv1g,1,0,5,iqbEC0Nzc36CoI60smIQpw

I have never seen foie gras served like that at a high end French restaurant, let alone a Michelin restaurant. Taste was strange in a bad way. Someone in my party got an upset stomach right after dining here.

If you only care about interior decor and using the finest bone China, then you may try here; although I don't understand why anyone would not care about food when they go to a restaurant.

124411,2007-12-20,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Tragically disappointing, unless you enjoy eating raw lobster and scallops.  Outrageously expensive as well.  Details below.

We visited Le Cirque on 12/17/07.  I wanted to take my partner and some lifelong friends out for a fantastic dinner in Las Vegas and the concierge assured me that this was one of the best restaurants in town.  ""Five star"" quality she said.

Well, the dinner was a total disaster.

First, our cocktail disaster.  We ordered Ketel One martinis, and from our table we watched the martinis sit in the shaker for nearly ten minutes before the bartender poured them into glasses.  When they finally got to us they tasted mostly like water.

Next, the appetizer disaster.  My partner ordered the scallops and lobster appetizer.  After one bite of the lobster, he realized that the lobster was NOT COOKED.  Everyone at the table inspected the appetizer and agreed that it was not cooked.  The restaurant manager agreed too, so she sent it back to the kitchen and brought my partner another one.  Well, the second appetizer had cooked lobster but RAW scallops!  So we had to send that one back too.  Yikes.  At this point, my partner declined a third try on the appetizer.

Because of this terrible screw up, the restaurant then decided to bring our entire table free garlic pasta appetizers (without asking us first).  Unfortunately, my partner does not eat fresh garlic, so they had to take that back.  Then, again without asking us first the restaurant brought my partner a foie gras appetizer, which he also couldn't eat because he doesn't like foie gras.  Even though the restaurant meant well by these gestures, they only made the situation worse because they didn't ask us what we wanted.

Now on to the wine steward disaster.  When we sat down, I consulted with the wine steward over wines and selected both white and red wine for our table.  Well, the red wine didn't show up until our main course was served, but no white wine -- the wine steward had completely forgotten about the white wine that I had selected!  We had to remind him.  This is not the type of wine steward service that I expect from a five star restaurant!

And finally, the main course disaster.  Three of our four main courses arrived barely warm.  At that point, my partner sent his main course back to the kitchen and decided to not eat dinner altogether.  I ate my sea bass main course and it was decent but would have been better hotter.  Not one of my dinner guests raved about the food at Le Cirque.

So overall, my wonderful idea of a fantastic dinner for my partner and my two longtime friends turned into something out of a Stephen King novel.  I was very disappointed.

Of course, the restaurant apologized profusely for serving us uncooked seafood and for the comedy of errors (especially since the manager witnessed all of it firsthand), and comped my partner's dinner, the watered down martinis and our bottle of red wine.  This was a nice gesture, but even after this, our bill still came to over $400 for four people.  Way too much money for the quality and service at this place.

Afterwards, we spoke to the general manager of the Bellagio Hotel, where we were also staying, about this horrible experience.  The general manager took my partner's drivers license number and address in order to run a background check on him, and then promised to contact us the following day about our situation.  The next day we received a call from the hotel's Risk Manager who offered us two free nights stay and free dinner for two on a future stay once my partner signed a legal liability release for the hotel and restaurant.  Yes, everything always comes down to the lawyers!!  LOL  So, the hotel did try to make things right for us as best as they could.

Luckily, after all of this, the MOST IMPORTANT THING is that my partner did not get sick from eating that one bite of uncooked lobster.  But it did create one very unpleasant experience for us.",av1op2NFCMJ3n0tys5t0QA,6,0,1,hFvLgwttAMksekn3G17JLw

Better than Le Bernardin, considered by people who do such considerings, the best seafood restaurant in the world? Yes. They also gave me a liquid egg. I loathe liquid eggs. I love hard boiled eggs, omelets, quiches and other such concoctions but fried, poached or otherwise liquidized eggs are the enemy of my palate. But Le Cirque somehow made it palatable.

If I remember correctly, it started with an oyster topped with caviar, then a smaller preparation of my lobster salad, a risotto covered with a layer of truffle shavings, a generous portion of seared foie gras, a perfectly cooked sea bass, filet mignon, a sorbet, and then a bread pudding type dessert. I was fortunate enough to get a taste of almost everything and the risotto and filet were incredible. The foie gras was really beyond words- incredibly rich and melt-in-your-mouth-y.

Everyone one of the 5 courses was above average.  Hands down the best thing,  was the risotto with the black truffles on top.  I will forever dream of it.  Definitely  worth the money!

Get a seat closer to the windows facing the fountains for the best view.  A little disappointed with the interior decor, but maybe it was because I was spoiled by staying at the Encore...

Bottom line- we ate here based on Yelp reviews and can't say I would go back given the number of other fine restaurants in Vegas.  You won't be disappointed, but you won't leave saying that it's one of the best meals you've ever had.",Eaxkd9Y5ZBRV1EPBb5Iwlg,0,0,4,VEofzJu6xjsSXPhLiQGcyw
229163,2008-11-02,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque is just a overall perfect place to dine. As soon as you walk in you know your in for a great experience. It has a warm, dark, and playful room and I was seated at a perfect little table with a great view of the Bellagio Fountain Show as I requested! As soon as I sat down the manager came and introduced himself. Everyone had smiles on there faces and was ready to jump for the smallest request. 

As soon as I sat down the bread basket arrived. Bread was nice and warm. It featured many different types such as raisin, wheat, pretzel and white. While most places give 2-3 different types this basket must have had 5 different types all in which were very good! I was then presented with a amuse! It was a Oyster topped with Caviar! This was by far the best Oyster I've had. It was as fresh as they come and the Caviar added a nice smooth salty flavor that was just amazing!

First Course was there famous Lobster Salad. The lobster was dressed with Black Truffle Dressing topped with some greens all wrapped up in a dill pickle. The lobster tasted very fresh and paired well with the dressing and the dill pickle just added the perfect amount of saltiness to it. Overall a great start and a tasteful dish!

Next up was the Foie Gras. Aw the sinful taste of Foie Gras. Some states have already banned it but Las Vegas will most likely always be the place to find Foie Gras and in MANY forms. Le Cirque's version was just awesome in every way. It reminded me much of the dish I had at Craftsteak. Sauteed Foie Gras with White Peach, Blackberries and Micro Greens. While Foie Gras itself is very rich no matter how the Chef prepares it, the White Peach and and Blackberries added a very nice lightness to the dish which I like when it comes to Foie Gras. Overall one of the best Foie Gras I've had. 

Course #3! OK so I'm a full blooded Risotto LOVER! This was my favorite dish of the meal. It had LOTS of lobster which was cooked to perfection along with very fresh tasting peas. While risotto can be a hit or miss for me this risotto was the best I've had besides the one at Gordan Ramsay's at the London in NY. Everything was perfect. It was rich of course but not to rich which is why risotto is a hit or miss for me because most make the dish WAY to rich and cheesy. It was just perfect!

Course #4: The Halibut. This was my first time having this fish and after trying it, it will not be my last. It was cooked to perfection! It featured Halibut, Pesto Emulsion, Calamari Popsicle, Borlotti Beans & Tomato. It a had beautiful green color, the Pesto Emulsion, and this was definitely the best fish dish I've ever had. The Halibut melted in your mouth and all the flavors paired perfect with each other. This restaurant knows how to cook seafood and I think its there Strong point!

Course #5: The restaurant is known for there Rabbit. So of course I had to order there signature entree and I've never had Rabbit before so I figured what the hey! The dish is called ""Blanquette"" de Lapin in which they call Rabbit Symphony: Ravioli, Roasted Loin, Braised Leg with Crispy Spaëtzles, Riesling Sauce! The Rabbit itself was good but a little dry, it reminded me a lot of pork but with the texture of chicken, the ravioli was good but also felt it to be a little dry as well. No flavors really popped and it was my least favorite dish but still a good dish and it was something new to me which is why I ordered it. 

Palate Cleanser: To be honest I lost my notes somewhere during the trip so I'm not sure what the heck it was but all I know it was VERY VERY good, refreshing and light which was perfect before desert! It featured Coconut Sorbet with some kind of peach infusion.

DESERT: Chocolate Souffle! Perfect in every way. Loved it. It was rich and I was only able to eat three bites but it was good! First bite I felt like I was floating on a chocolate cloud with ice cream just slowing pouring over me!!!! And the end of the meal they present you with fabulous plate of petite fours, which I had them wrap to go because I was so full, and a nice little Le Cirque box which had some delectable chocolates in them and was a nice little souvenir!

Overall this was a AWESOME meal and loved every moment of it. The service doesn't get any better and was made to feel very comfortable as a solo diner. The manager came by throughout the meal to make sure everything was to my liking! The only negative I would say is they are to generous with there tasting menu. I hate leaving a restaurant stuffed to the point I can pairly walk. This place doesn't get enough credit and is in the same price range as many of the ""Celebrity Chefs"" restaurants which is why I think many people choose to dine at other restaurants just to say they dined there. If you want to be treated like royalty for a night with a ambiance and food that is just perfect then Le Cirque is the place to go!",zjdNmQTjA6IXQaJZUYYwHg,0,0,5,7yAUQfLICf_wrncHcTGWog

I can only judge the food from my one dessert and the little dessert sampler they bring out with it, but if all the food is as good as these items, then Le Cirque rightfully deserves to be one of the top 10 restaurants on the Strip. Our dessert (I can't remember the name) was a marvelous creation of strawberries, creme, and streussel in an egg shaped bowl made out of ice and floating on a bowl of pink-colored ice chips. And the dessert sampler they brought out with it (always a classy touch) was just as wonderful. Service here is as fine as anywhere in Vegas - the staff is the definition of restaurant professionalism.

570848,2013-03-02,5,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I had the opportunity to dine at Le Cirque during a recent trip to Las Vegas. This New York City fine dining outpost is located in the lovely 5-star Bellagio Hotel and Resort, and is one of the cornerstones of the hotel's dining experiences. My expectations for the restaurant were quite high, but both the floor staff and kitchen fully delivered with an amazing meal and a very memorable evening.

My recommendation is to definitely go with the Le Cirque dégustation menu rather than ordering a la carte, and certainly do opt for the lovely wine pairings. You will not be disappointed. Unlike some tasting menus, you will have an element of control in the selection of your dishes while still experiencing the full range of what the chef and his staff can create. The exemplary service from the wait staff and sommelier at Le Cirque is professional and attentive without feeling at all intrusive.

Although I ordered the snow crab as my starter, I was surprised when the waiter brought a lovely amuse bouche of uni with lemon grass gelée and a fennel puree. It was sublime, as was my actual starter of snow crab with turnip, apple, avocado and pomegranate.

Sautéed foie gras with pear confit - and a salty caramel sauce - did not disappoint. It was delicate and well balanced. My only complaint is that I could easily have eaten three portions. But with a tasting menu one must be patient and pace ones self.

Although I hail from Alaska, I do like to see how chefs handle our seafood bounty. Alaskan black cod with citrus, shellfish and coconut nage was perfectly cooked and received my vote of confidence. There was a pleasant touch of acidity that perfectly counterbalanced the richness of the fish.

Less successful was the suckling pig tasting with purple potato and a truffle vinaigrette. The bit of pork loin was succulent but other porcine portions of the dish were sadly dry and over-cooked. In hindsight I wished I'd ordered the Kobe beef tenderloin enjoyed by a gent at the next table - it looked delicious, and his murmurs of approval spoke volumes.

Dinner finished with a sweet-savory pre-dessert, a dessert of fluffy chocolate soufflé and assorted petit fours, and the evening wrapped up with a lovely gift box of truffles. This was a meal that I did not want to ever see end.

Is dining at Le Cirque it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely, emphatically yes. Don't ask questions ... just do it.",j-8aTRLpfdhainESk5o0Aw,7,7,5,HMMTjAkKZRHuXrYH8k33dw

For the main course, I had the Coeur de Filet de Boeuf which was to die for.  The portion was not to big and the foie gras that came on the side was excellent.

I had the creme brulee which was perfect, it came with a small scoop of lemon gelato that was topped with edible gold... yes, that's right, edible gold.  Finally, they do give each table a really cool gift box that has two delicious truffles.

The food was excellent and you could tell they put a lot of thought into their dishes.

Service: Truly amazing.  I was a little worried that my boyfriend and I were going to deal with condescending waiters who would label us as young kids who had no business in being in a frou frou restaurant.  This was not the case at all.  Everyone was polite and courteous and we got the same level of service that the other customers got.  Every staff member knew where they had to be and you could see how everything worked like clockwork.

Ambiance:  Its a small restaurant which for me, made me feel special.  It's circus themed with the ceiling looking like a tent top.  Paintings are of circus scenes.  My favorite thing though were the dishes.  They were monkey themed and I am the hugest monkey fan.  The restaurant has a view of the Bellagio fountains.

After my experience, I understand why this restaurant is a 5 star award winner.  While the prices may scare you away, I say its worth going and checking out.  It will definitely be one of your most memorable meals.",pnrG47iwW26dDyHCwEr8UQ,1,0,5,csSZZLXiNzYCoSCCrYladA
590570,2015-03-16,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Let me begin by saying my review is skewed by my disappointment with my waiter, which I will explain at the end.  Four of us went there for dinner--two couples. The room is nice, not noisy at all. The wait staff is attentive, without hovering all over you.  For starters, my wife and my friend had the lobster and avocado salad--just so-so, not a lot of flavor.  I had the escargot--they were good. My friend's wife had the lobster risotto--it was out of this world.  My friend and his wife had the dover sole; it was good, but definitely not Michael's (South Point), which is the gold standard. My wife had sea bass; it was ok. I had venison; it was outstanding. The three medallions were as tasty as any tenderloin, anywhere.  Three of us had chocolate soufflé. It was really good. The chocolate ball was nothing special.  All in all, if you know what to order, you could have a fantastic meal. As for the waiter, I asked the maître d to make sure I got the bill instead of my friend, and gave him my credit card, and told him to add 20%. When the bill came, it showed a total, nothing on the gratuity line, and nothing totaled. I assumed the tip had not been included and added 20%. When I got home I realized the bill was $525, they added $105 for a tip, for a total of $630. But when they brought the slip for me to sign, the waiter had left the tip space blank. I felt like I was tricked by a sneaky waiter who definitely did not deserve a double tip. I really expected to get a call from the restaurant telling me about the error.  I now feel the waiter knew exactly what he was doing, and intentionally tricked me. I would have given Le Cirque four stars, but feel the waiter's actions cut it in half.",uCNo-Hk4Kqid4MMAqQxk_g,0,0,2,7nM4GCHxjkVpt-VNz80CjQ

674621,2013-02-17,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Still fresh in my mind from our Valentines dinner.  Been almost 10 years since I've been to Le Cirque, so we decided to come back.  Had one of the later seatings, so the restaurant wouldn't be that busy, and got lucky with a window seat for fountain view.  The restaurant is a bit off to the side and kind of water level, so it isn't a great view; but having see the fountains a million times, whatever... :P  Beautiful dining room though, I had forgotten the ambiance of sitting under a colorful circus tent. :)

Set menus for every one that night, so we just picked an assortment of goodies from the menu.  I'll try to recall them, but some of the things are more memorable than others.  I had dinner with the wine paring, wife got a coke and the kobe addon.

Amuse - foie gras mousse.  Interesting présentation and just enough for a table spoon full of flavor.  Good starter.  

Appetizers -
 - snow crab salad with turnip and caviar - very tasty.  little pomegranates for extra burst of citrusy flavor.  paired with Ruinart blanc de blanc - not a huge champagne fan, but this glass was excellent.
 - deconstructed baked potato - meh.  wife said it was mostly prosciutto and some creme fraiche and a tiny block of potato.  she ate mostly from my plate.

 - sea urchin capellini - very yummy noodles, but I think the uni was either bad or something...ULTRA bad fishy taste.  I almost sent it back...but decided to just scrape off the uni and eat the noodles.  paired with Puligny-Montrachet chardonnay; i've never had a chardonnay from outside of California, so this was an eye opener for me.  nice muted pear flavors to go with the noodles.
 - pan seared foie gras with pear and roasted almonds.  very yummy.  i tried to steal this from the wife and got some nasty looks. :)

Fishies -
 - paupiette of sea bass - very tender and flavorful.  the pinot reduction made this a rockstar dish.  used to sea bass being miso/asian flavored, so this was a good change of pace.
 - crispy blackened bass with artichoke sauce.  awesome, awesome dish.  was one of my favorite moments of the night.  nice subtle bass flavored in with a crunchy of the skin and the creamy artichoke sauce.  probably one of the best fish dishes i've ever had.  little odd that it was paired with a light french pinot from Nuits St Georges though...but still yummy!

Main -
 - new zealand venison, broccolini, brussels sprout, date beignet.  very tender cuts of venison, no gamey taste to it.  almost like a nice veal, but nothing like the wife's kobe.  paired with chateau giscour.
 - a5 kobe, truffle potato puree, shishito pepper.  what is there to say about this dish besides that it's really, really good.  nice cut of beef, well seasoned, perfect with little slivers of shishito pepper.

Desserts -
memorable because both of them were in the shape of spheres.  the chocolate ball was melted with cocoa sauce, which made for an amazing presentation.  yuzu ball was also cool looking, but wasn't quite so yummy.  the sauternes also tasted like cheap Albertson's alcohol, so didn't really have much after the first sip.

Over all though, another great experience at Le Cirque, good food, great service, and some funny one-liners from the wine sommelier. :)",2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A,2,0,4,yB9ZJZbp0VU7eBSBTbrtOA

Stopped by a little after 10pm exactly one week ago, as the 3rd stop on our Vegas eating spree! They were already closed, but were kind enough to allow us to join them at the bar for dessert.

We were recommended a tasty glass of Moscato D'Asti to accompany our desserts.

Next thing you know, compliments of the pastry chef: tequila lime sorbet with pink grapefruit, grapefruit gelee, and pop rocks (see my photos). What a delightful and refreshing start to dessert!

This was followed by a platter of pre-dessert treats!

And then, our desserts! OUR JAWS DROPPED at the presentation! We immediately captured images of these gorgeously amazing, elaborate creations!

My vanilla poached strawberries with yuzu cream and crunchy streudel arrived in a sculpted bowl of ice, atop a mountain of crushed ice. Good looking, tasty, well-balanced, and a generous portion!

My partner's glossy sugar sphere was filled with lycee cream and dragon fruit cubes (and maybe something else I'm forgetting?). I've never seen anything like it! OMG SO GOOD! That is, after he reluctantly agreed to crack the sugar sphere. You've got to look at the pic of this one!

As if that weren't enough to make me feel like the most spoiled Princess EVER, I was given a jewelry box with secret compartments concealing truffles!!!

The service was excellent! The staff were attentive, gregarious, generous, and welcoming.
The presentation of the desserts was out of this world!
The desserts and dessert wine were top notch.

We are DEFINITELY coming back to experience a full meal here the next time we're in Vegas!!!!

793354,2016-05-24,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Good:
- Fantastic decor, very tasteful and playful with circus paintings and a ""big top"" feel
- Front of house extremely well-run, see ""Ugly"" for exception
- Menu items are well-constructed and well-presented
- Cocktail bar in foyer has excellent selection (Yamazaki 18!) and a very pleasant bartender
- Does all the little things right, like the amuse-bouche up front and macarons to close
- Reasonable pre-theatre menu ($72, optional +$30 for wine pairings)

Bad:
- Supplement costs a mite unreasonable
- Tables are quite close to each other and voices carry

Ugly:
- Waiter made an off-color joke about me dining and dashing. He asked if I was a guest at Bellagio (so he could bill my room, at a guess), I replied that I was staying at Caesar's. He then (jokingly I hope) said that if I left he'd have to chase after me and it wouldn't be a good look for either of us.

This is a ""jacket recommended"" kind of place, and I arrived in a 2-piece suit. At no point did I give the impression of not belonging, unlike the party next to me that arrived in Bermuda shirts and shorts. If the waiter was joking, it was in extremely poor taste. If not, even worse. Really soured what was otherwise an immaculate dining experience. From my observation, every single other member of the front of house was pristine and fantastic, which made his behavior all the more ridiculous.",V2U28iWEUf2SilfzXv3LFw,1,0,3,9ekaq-2D2zrApTpV2gNM1A

801111,2011-11-10,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque is amazing and as best as it can in every way. Food was fantastic, the interior was the most beautiful with a circus element, and it is needless to say how amazing it was to dine while looking out the Bellagio fountain. The service was top class and the waiters were very attentive, working closely to cater to the needs of the diners. 

Before I go further on to describe more about the restaurant and my experience, I must say that I was quite impressed with one thing. To keep the story simple, I went to Le Cirque with a group of people and some members do not drink and have never drank wine before, and were demanding for fruity non-alcoholic drinks, which is just about the most embarrassing thing that one can do in a fine dining restaurant particularly French. And most importantly, we were generally quite underdressed, which undoubtedly gave off the impression that we were some locals from California that visited Vegas for the first time. For an upscale French restaurant, this could tilt the waiters to act with more contempt, and one cannot reason why this is happening. To my surprise, and different from my previous experiences in situations like this in a fine dining restaurant, the waiters, including the manager, were totally unpretentious and treated us with great attentiveness. This may not sound like nothing much to anyone else, but this contributed quite largely to my pleasant experience at Le Cirque.

I disagree with many people who mentioned that Le Cirque was surreally, or extremely expensive. If you are in Vegas, most places are extremely overpriced with less than decent food. You are expected to pay more anywhere you go unless you go to fast food restaurants. I would like to say that Le Cirque is not overly priced for what it offers. Given that they serve top class French course meal, with the Bellagio fountain view, and an interior that is arguably the most romantic in Las Vegas, I believe that people are getting just about what they are paying for. Don't forget that this is Vegas, people. 

The restaurant itself is quite small, the ambience of the restaurant is warm and intimate. The degustation course that we had was phenomenal and every course was an excitement, a reason to live and die for, and titillating (not a good choice of word here) to the taste buds. I went with the Le Cirque Lobster salad, sauteed Foie Gras with white chocolate & raison brioche, paupiette of Loup de Mer (a sea bass interpreted differently), and Wagyu Kobe beef tenderloin, finished off with Creme Brulee Le Cirque. As you can see in the pictures, they are quite amazing, not only in presentation, but how tasteful and memorable each dish was. Even the plates, utensils were beautiful, making it more pleasing to the eyes. I must say that what amazed me the most was their selection of desserts. Every single one of them is fantastic. Our table ordered every single one, and shared all of them. I'm not gonna lie, it was a party. 

I am glad that I had a chance to go to Le Cirque and if I go back to Vegas with my beloved one, I would love to go again. Please be sure to make reservations before you make the trip though. It would be very sad if I had your hopes up and then you found out the restaurant was fully booked week after another.",AmMsxK4ooPok74Hb6UGQMg,2,1,5,HqQ67b5GIKckPN-b3ayriw

These are the reasons why Le Cirque is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. This was our second visit, and although not the best night to sit down for a three course tasting meal (we had just arrived from the East coast and metabolism was at 11 PM in that time zone), we soon forgot it was our bed time. 
You can't hep but have fun here. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable, yes. But, what I like is the exuberance and friendliness of this restaurant. I enjoy good food, but an evening is sometimes dampened with too much stuffiness. Not here! 

I started with the lobster and avocado salad and followed it with the ""symphony"" of rabbit paired with spatlese on the side. The chef's sauce for this dish had me wanting to lick the bowl. Julia Child would be jealous. The spatlese was a miss for me- not reminiscent of the German kind; it was bland and dry, and it didn't add anything to the rabbit.
The wine pairings were wonderful: sauvignon blanc from Loire Valley for the salad, a pinot noir from Oregon, and a nice ice wine for the souffle'.

We ordered chocolate souffles ahead of time for our desserts. Incredible! 
Just when you think the evening can't get better, you are handed a lovely small box that looks like a jewelry case. Inside are two perfectly shaped bon bons. We saved these and had them for dessert five nights later after we arrived home. We're still savoring the occasion.

Not an everyday restaurant and I hope they keep it special. I do suggest given the size of the place that they limit the parties they seat to 6-8. Large groups tend to be loud and dominate the service. Still, far better than Piccasso and much more welcoming than Andre's.

870807,2010-08-10,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"While I feel I got reasonable value out my $98 pre-theater menu + wine pairing with respect to Las Vegas extreme pricing, I do not feel I ate at the same restaurant as other reviewers.

The decor was spectacular with the modern circus theme and the backdrop of the Bellagio fountains.  I was placed at a table against a wall, with tables immediately to the left and right of me.  This was a enjoyable spot while those adjacent tables were empty, but when two couples were seated at both sides, I felt like all privacy was lost.  The tables were close together a la NYC, where I felt like I was involved in the surrounding conversations.

The bread course was pretty good. Although I can't remember  specifically the breads I picked, I think these were well formed French breads with a nice crust and crumb.  The amuse bouche was a chilled canteloupe  soup which was very nice and was the standout of of my meal. Complements to the chef.

The rest of the meal becomes a little on the mediocre side, and I feel like I payed for what I got (again relative to Vegas high prices).  The risotto from the pre-theater menu I believe (and I could be mistaken) was a mushroom risotto and not the truffle risotto from the a la carte menu.  It was good enough relative to quality Italian restaurant, but not a standout in the scheme of high end Vegas eateries  

The pot-au-feu was not to exciting either.   The rib meat was served in a simple clear beef broth accompanied with a a few slivers of beet, snap peas, and a bone marrow.  The meat was cooked just fine, soft and tender as short ribs should be, but the broth was underwhelming and the vegetables were a bit bland.  I won't comment much on the bone marrow, as I have no experience with bone marrow.  To me, it wasn't as exciting or tasty as what folks on the food channel parlay, but that could just be me.

The chocolate souffle, was good, but again not anything that stands out. If anything, the dessert portion was too big, and I felt sick afterwards.  I would have rather had cheeses, but in general I prefer a savory cheese dish for after the meal than a sweet thing.

The wine pairing was nothing to complain about. For $30, I got nothing spectacular, but complemented classic French/Italian fare just fine.

In summary, I felt like the highlight of the meal was the ambiance, and even that was destroyed at the end of the meal by the emplacement of people at the all too close adjacent tables.  The food was on par with a decent local French restaurant in any major city or suburb, and with the pre-theater pricing, the total bill wasn't much worse than what I would get at that local French restaurant.  I would recommend, but don't expect to be mesmerized by the pre-theater menu. Perhaps the a la carte menu is more of a standout!",pzBU3e-SjOw3sBDcy8QKEw,0,0,3,Uo-k-a8g91HhZS_ID1GFXA

Everyone at my table had the tasting menu, which was an excellent value at $125.00. 

The oyster amuse bouche was delicious. Even the oyster hater at our table thought it was tasty. The lobster salad was very good, as was the fois gras. One of my dining companions upgraded from the fois gras to the truffle risotto, and in my opinion the upgrade was worth the extra $35.00. I stole a taste, and that risotto was the best I've ever tried.

The sea bass wasn't a hit for me, but everyone else at the table loved it. To me, it tasted as if there was a hint of something moldy in the accompanying vegetables, and I found the pastry wrap a bit greasy. 

The duck course was excellent. The desserts were to die for. I tend to be disappointed with the desserts in high end restaurants, but not here. We were served a molten chocolate lava cake, a citrus sorbet served in an ice bowl, and an unbelievable pear soufflé. All were fabulous. 

The service was attentive and friendly without being overly familiar or intrusive. I enjoyed every moment of my evening, which more than made up for my disappointment with Twist at the Mandarin Oriental the previous night.

It is 100 degrees (and, with recent t-storms, 60% humidity) in Las Vegas right now. I live in LA and am here for a couple of days... to be honest, I didn't even bring pants.  Or shoes.  Pants are a fine requirement, if they want to make it so.  But in a place like Las Vegas, in Summer especially, that requirement is not obvious to me.  Even at LeCirque.  

The restaurant's handling of our arrival was poor.  The staff fliply suggested I could just go upstairs, change and come back.  That would have been great if I were staying at the Bellagio (vs. the Venetian half a mile away, where my wife's conference was)--and if I had brought pants.  They also suggested that maybe I should try the casual (and empty) sushi restaurant next to LeCirque (because that restaurant apparently doesn't care about people wearing pants).  I've been there.  It's not really in the same ballpark; and I found it a bit insulting.

I am aware that this is a nice restaurant.  I have never been.  But I go to nice restaurants.  In nice cities.  And, if I were going to the original Le Cirque in NYC, I most certainly would have known to wear an appropriate suit (perhaps even with pants).

On the other hand, In 100 degree-60% humidity-Las Vegas--where I spent $700 on dinner for two at Nobu the night before (and wore shorts)--this restaurant owes it to make this requirement clear up front.  

In the end, I found these people to be snooty jerks.  And frankly, LeCirque can't credibly ""put on airs"" that ""it's not catering to Vegas tourists""...  at least to me, it's somewhat ""gauche"" for a restaurant ""of this caliber"" to bait $70 prix fixe dinners to fill the tables.",9vz1dNRVqoGaUs-5kWhKSw,1,0,1,Fh9phoH5g4GAsEXMIlfjqg

The desserts (they brought one for each tasting) was terrific without being too experimental and the pre-dessert palate cleanser (raspberry sorbet with grapefruit?) was really terrific.

I must say that the atmosphere is great. As you can derive from its name, Le Cirque has a circus theme - the walls are covered with cartoon drawings of circus performers and the menu is covered in simple circus decor. The upholstery of the restaurant is striped (as consistent with the theme) and the view, should you have the privilege, of the Bellagio fountains from a window seat is absolutely amazing. Of course, it's even more spectacular if you are present when the fountain shows are active.

The experience with the staff/servers has always been pleasant. Most people think, ""Well, if I'm paying these prices to get an upscale meal, I should be getting the greatest service"". That, however, hasn't always been the case with some of the fine dining places that I've been to. Le Cirque has a staff of laid-back, down-to-earth people. It's always a pleasure speaking to the folks. 

All the dishes are pretty amazing. No need for any additional flavoring... and that's the way it should be. No substitutions needed because the food is superb the way it is. It's probably preference on my part, but I prefer their cut of beef over the veal or rabbit.

Started the night with a martini and it was a delicious drink, and strong - left me buzzed the whole night. I wish I wasn't, so I could have enjoyed the food better. 
We ordered the degustation menu which turned out to be a little too much for me since there's four courses. Started with an amuse bouche of foie gras mousse which was excellent, followed by our appetizers, a sauteed foie gras and nantucket bay scallops. Both are delicious but I made a mental note to order foie gras next time I'm here because that's the better one. 
For fish we both ordered the paupiette of seabass, crispy potatoes, braised leeks in pinot noir reduction. Good but didn't blow me away. 
Here's the winner - the kobe beef. I'm not a beef person and so I didn't order this because I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it at $65 extra. REGRET. Husband ordered this and kobe beef is really something else. The texture and flavor is simply out of this world. I despise my veal after tasting it. You know, when you feel like you married the wrong guy? Could have been savoring that kobe beef instead of the drab boring veal. Maybe if I've never met kobe beef, the veal would have been alright. 
Dessert - order the chocolate ball and see the chain effect. The table next to us ordered one and we decided we had to get one. When ours came the new table next to us saw that and decided they had to order one too. It is literally white chocolate icecream encased in a frozen chocolate shell. The server then pours hot melted chocolate over the ball and you watch as the outer shell melt away to reveal the icecream inside. It's such a visual treat.

1159751,2016-08-02,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"When friends of ours were married at Bellagio we wanted a special celebratory dinner afterward.  From our call to request a reservation through paying the check, the staff at Le Cirque was professional and attentive.  It clearly mattered a great deal to everyone at the restaurant that we have a perfect experience.  

We started with drinks in the small lounge because we arrived early.  One of our number described what she liked In a wine, rather than peruse the Wine tome.  Within moments she had a glass of something that was perfect.  In fact we ordered a bottle for the table with dinner.  While we were sitting there a couple arrived not exactly dressed for dinner at Le Cirque (but by no means poorly).  They asked if they could sit in the lounge and have desert.  They were made to feel welcome in the lounge, which struck me as gracious and unpretentious.  We did not feel like we were waiting long for a table, but the staff was clearly concerned about the wait.  As it turned out, they wanted us to be seated at what they considered the best table in the house for this special dinner, and passed on seating us elsewhere.   Mind you, we were not even guests at Belagio.  No VIPs in this group.

The food was amazing, the table was ideal, and every course was just perfect. We all ordered the Prixe Fixe menu.  First though, we were served a complimentary appetizer of smoked salmon with something else I can't recall with a caviar garnish.  Each serving was in a small dish and the server who brought it out asked if we would please consider being certain that all the layers of the dish were present in each bite.  It was very good. Then the actual appetizers came out.  I had the tenderloin carpaccio.  It came accompanied by a tiny raw quail egg, and our waiter explained the custom of pouring the tiny egg on top of the beef and eating it with toast. Another in our group had the cold corn soup, which she reported was indescribably good, and like nothing she had ever had before.  The others selected the lobster salad which garnered many complements.   My entree was the rabbit symphony, and I'm glad I selected it.  Others had the diver scallops and one chose the sea bass which, for lack of a better description, resembled a large egg roll because it was inside a potato crust.  Everyone was pleased with their selection.  The only mistake made by the staff all night was a very happy accident for us.  We ended up with a chocolate soufflé for the table in addition to the other desserts. Each one was unique and delicious.  The chocolate ball should not be missed.  It is a perfect sphere of chocolate served in a shallow bowl. The server then pours warm chocolate sauce on top at the table and slowly the ball dissolves to reveal a praline filling.

The decor is unique and beautiful in the cozy dining room overlooking the fountains.  The concept is that you are inside a closed jewelry box.  We were surprised how small the dining room was, but the acoustics are such that conversation is easy.  I don't think there was any music, which I only noticed toward the end, which was well after the advertised closing time.  At no point did we feel like we were overstaying our welcome.

The restaurant was generous to say the least, and when we couldn't possibly eat another bite, a beautiful dish of petit fours appeared.  Naturally, they disappeared.  It is impossible to pass on anything created in this kitchen.  The ladies were then presented with a gift of a miniature jewelry box with two chocolates inside.

We all agreed this was the best dining experience any of us had every had, and we are all...let's say ""experienced""...diners.  This truly is as good as it gets.  Do not pass on an opportunity to to visit.",eRTEqnums9QCc0aJ3psaUA,0,0,5,j9SekkOYwf05pXXojCoiug

Had to get off the beaten path to have a good experience. Well, this is not off the beaten path and felt the same. Server was very vague about two menus, so much so that I did not realize the only menu he had given me was full of supplemental charges, above the price my sister had already paid. Only one copy of our intended menu was given to us, put aside like an afterthought. I mistakenly chose an entree not on the deal for a $33 upcharge and did not know it. My lobster avocado starter was very good, my lamb was good, otherwise more about presentation than astonishing flavors. My sister's salad was miniscule and her generous portion of chicken was dry and flavorless. No drinks and over a $200 dinner.

The service is impeccable. 
It was 3 of us and we got the best emotions and experience after the dinner.
I got the salad - I dont remember the name  (maybe that's why I was refused Elite 13 by Yelp - Im a bad yelper) Thus, this salad is the first one in the menu. 

On the huge white plate there was a small green salad which looked like a roll with avocado, asparagus all some other green stuff inside and it was covered by a thick slice of cucumber. On the other side of the plate there was a lobster tail (perfectly cooked!) and on the third side there was a piece of the meat from crab claw. 
Great combination!
Perfect size!
the ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and chic. Very elegant ceiling covers and 5 stars view on the belagio lake  - Thus, every half an hour you could see the dance of the fountain.
At the end, we received cute little gifts from the restaurant  - So I didnt have to buy a souvenir for my bf. Cute box with 2 candies.",ddOMtq46o4CshCmHQxR2QQ,8,6,5,z_r3DW4cmp7VdCkjODHpAw

1197802,2012-02-27,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"this was absolutely the worse fine dining experience i've ever had (and as our host had pointed out, i would know, i'm from SF). not merely because the food wasn't that great, but because the restaurant botched my experience altogether.

i made reservations for a party of 2 on a thursday night for my bf's birthday celebration. i called again the day of to make sure they had that the restaurant knew we were celebrating a birthday and to sit us by the window so we can have a view of the water show. during our dinner, the waiter/servers/host (a group of what? 5-6 people altogether) completely forgot the fact that it was bf's birthday. 

fine, ignore my request to sit by the window even though a table was readily available and given to the party of two after us, ok...be oblivious to the fact were celebrating his birthday...including no ""happy birthday"" writing on the dessert, but to hand him the check at the end and thank us for coming...well that was pretty much all i could take. i pretty much burst into tears on the spot. 

i don't know how many fanciful restaurant can pride themselves on ruining a perfectly good evening and making a girl cry because of their crappy service, but this one is definitely a winner for ruining a once in life time birthday. after all, how many times do you turn 28? (the answer is once).

oh, we had the 5-course menu. it's not worth the $400 (including 2 glasses of wine and an additional appetizer) i paid since the food was mediocre and unexciting (langostine was overcooked, sea urchin odd flavor combo, fish entress were not good- turbot was dry and fishy/ sea bass was okay, did not give us an option between cheese and sorbet, duck was soggy and plain, wagyu was tough and flavorless, choc soufflee had an odd texture (too much egg white?) and strange watery liquid on the bottom). my unbias opinion about the food is that you should take the $400 and go to Joel Rubuchon or L'Atelier instead if you're looking for french. but in the name of a complete rip off, just avoid this place altogether.

yes, the waiter/servers did try to make it up in the end, after i paid the bill, burst into tears, and told them you completely forgot it's my bf's bday. they came out with a plate of 5 bite sized desserts with the words ""happy birthday"" written on it and offered my bf a treasure chest box that are usually given to the girls. yay. that made it all up. and on the way out, when i asked the hostess what happened? she told me yes, she absolutely got the note and had mentioned it...she had no clue how they missed it. even more reassuring.",DwJU5xy9AQfvEt8zlrNnhA,3,0,1,5VzkDKSR5adv04MZRMqxng

But other than the exorbitant price, everything else was spectacular. They had the best cocktails I've ever had, the service was friendly and not overbearing, and the food was exquisite.

1220906,2018-04-08,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Wow. Where do I begin? First and foremost, the reputation this Vegas icon has achieved through the years is more than well-deserved.

My girlfriend and I dined there last week before going to the 7 pm showing of ""O"", and as a result, had to choose between the pre theater and prix fixe menu. Girlfriend liked the pre theater options better, so we decided and off to the races!

To start we had a Myvegas credit for the house champagne, which was delightful and crisp with the appetizers. I got the foie gras, my girlfriend the English pea risotto. While the risotto was creamy, decadent, and delicious, the foie gras stole the show. They used a brandy made from Normandy, France, that really brought the dish around. Every bite was spectacular, and I could easily have done several courses on this alone.

For main dishes we did the beef tenderloin and Chilean sea bass. The sea bass was wrapped in a crisp potato layer that was just the right texture and consistency to not overpower the fish. The beef was simply the best non-wagyu cut of meat I've ever had. (My girlfriend let me try hers). Even the potatoes mousseline that accompanied the beef were to die for. We didn't want to be too drowsy for the show, so we skipped wine pairing and had a cocktail with the desserts, which again were almost too pretty to eat! I thought I was going to be all about the chocolate ball, but the strawberry parfait was so refreshing and sweet after all the rich fare that it took top honors for me.

As for service, there's a reason this place has a Michelin star and Forbes 5 Diamond. Old world service, attentive without being intrusive, non judgemental and no attitude about doing the pre theater menu, no attitude about the free credit, and of course beyond knowledgeable about the menu options. Our table was lead by Daniel, along with a host of servers refilling water, wiping away crumbs, offering more bread, all while feeling invisible, which I found especially impressive given the small size of the restaurant. To top it off, a view of the fountains only to be surpassed by the likes of Lago and Picasso. My heartfelt thanks to Daniel and the Le Cirque team for making even a brief dinner a memorable one.",7vFWz2YcWWC5UnPYNm7KNA,1,1,5,xk9oo_byZQclgqA8Alg2qw

1249721,2013-05-14,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"My wife and I decided to splurge and go for the 'fancy' French restaurant experience.  After some deliberation we decided on Le Cirque and I'm so happy we did.  Everything about this place from the decor, the service staff and the food is exceptional.  

We had 7:30 pm reservations on a Tuesday night.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and were seated immediately.  The interior space is smaller than I would've expected.  The setting is intimate but not clausterphobic   The ceiling is covered in fabric making it look like the inside of a circus tent and the walls are covered with old-time circus paintings with matching artwork on the plates and dishes.  The room is relatively well-lit (for a restaurant) and the noise level was low-medium.  A number of the seats have a view of the fountains.  We didn't specify a seating location and were seated on the opposite side of the room.  That was fine with us, but I imagine you can specify a fountain-view table.  

The service staff here is simply amazing.  They truly make the meal memorable.  I've eaten in all different kinds of restaurants from the fancy to straight-up shacks.  No matter how many fancy ones I hit, I always wonder if I'm going to feel uncomfortable.  The staff here immediately took away any concerns I had.  They do a wonderful job of being extremely attentive, informative and personal without ever being stuffy or pretentious.

We each had the Dégustation Menu with the premium wine pairing.  This tasting menu is unique because it gives you choices for each course.  They started with an Amusee Bouche, a little goat cheese and strawberry parfait thingy.  Very tasty.  Then it was on to courses.  The wife had the langustino, scallop, halibut and the Kobe beef.  I had the king crab, lobster risotto, sea bass and rabbit.  Everything was amazing.  I could go on an on in excruciating detail each course but I'll keep it short and say that it was up to par and I couldn't find a fault with any of it.  That said, I think the winners of the night were the king crab, lobster risotto, halibut and Kobe beef.  The beef is incredible.  It was my first time trying it and it certainly lived up to the hype.  There was an up charge to add it, but since you're eating at Le Cirque and already spending an arm and a leg, what're a few more bucks?  They give a fun little pre-dessert palate cleanser after the main courses.  No spoiler, but let's say it included a childhood candy I was not expecting to see in this restaurant.  There were a number of choices for dessert.  Wifey had the chocolate ball, which has a really cool table presentation and I had pear and caramel ice cream in a merengue.  Both were delicious.  The wine was delicious and I love the idea of having it professionally selected.  Stress-free dining!!

All in all, this was probably the best meal, start to finish, I've ever had.  That said, it was also easily the most expensive meal I've ever had.  So if you're in Vegas looking to splurge on an amazing dining experience, this is the place.",y2vJyqImj1e1R-WR3lFPtg,4,3,5,b6W8APaJ22sqi6KhNFzMpA

I would rather dine at Le Cirque than Alinea. The service at Le Cirque is more friendly and seemed less rehearsed. The food that Chef Gregory creates is more sophisticated and flavorful. Grant(ed), the dining experience at Alinea is absolutely wonderful and it is almost like attending a theater performance. And there is nothing quite like having a meal at Alinea.

This is a 5 star French dining experience. Jacket recommended but not required. 

We arrived a few minutes before 5 and the door was still locked. Promptly at 5pm they opened the doors and we were seated at a nice table with a view of the famous Bellagio fountains. The restaurant is very small and intimate. Beautifully decorated. 

We decided to have the special pre-show 3 course meal which proved to be plenty of food. I chose the escargot, the hanger steak, and the chocolate ball. My wife had the organic greens salad, the sea bass, and the chocolate ball. We also chose the wine pairing for an additional $40. So for roughly $115 a head we were all set. Not cheap but that is not why you go here. But actually that a quite a deal for what you get. There were several other menu options at a variety of price points up to $375 a head for a 10 course tasting.

I won't get into the details of every dish. All I need to say is that everything was presented beautifully, was extremely well prepared, and delicious. The hanger steak I will say was nothing amazing, but the burgundy sauce for it was, and the potato side was awesome.

It sits near the famous Bellagio water fountain with an incredible view of the hourly shows.  The restaurant atmosphere is warm and intimate.  It's clear that circus is the theme, a very exquisite circus that is.

Since the Degustation Menu was available with awesome wine pairing selection, we decided to give it a try.  It's a 5 main course meal with goodies in between, and we had a wonderful experience.

First Course:
- White Asparagus, Scottish Smoked Salmon, New Potatoes Crusted Farm Egg, Osetra Caviar, Sorrel Purée, Ravigote Vinaigrette

Very good mixture of caviar and salmon.  Everything tasted exceptional well together

- Santa Barbara Sea Urchin ""Ice Cream"", Ginger-Lemon Grass Gelée, Fennel Mousse

Words can't describe how great this dish was.  Uni melts in my mouth and the mousse is amazing!  Remember to dig to the bottom with your spoon, so you can enjoy the layers in one bite!

Second Course:

- Sautéed Sonoma Foie Gras, White Chocolate & Raisin Brioche, Roasted Rhubarb, Cardamom Streusel, Ibiscus & Champagne Gastrique

THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal! Never tasted any Foie Gras that's as good as this!  The wine pairing of a 1929 port is amazing.  The sweetness of the wine really did a wonderful job breaking down the fatty taste of the Foie Gras.  Highly recommended!  The waiter also spent some time intriguing me with the technique French used to preserve grapes that's over 80 years old! 

-Risotto in Rhythm with the Season

Solid dish with lots of flavors

Third Course:

-Traditional Seafood Bouillabaisse, Fennel Confit, Purple Vitelottes, Shellfish Fumet, Saffron Rouille

-Chilean Sea Bass, Purple Artichoke, ""Grenaille"" Potatoes, Chanterelles, Tomato Confit, Verbena Sauce

Again, very solid dishes with exceptional taste

Fourth Course:

- Honey Glazed Barbary Duck Magret, Daikon Duck Confit, Spiced Sweet Potato, Bing Cherry au Foie Gras, Ruby Port Sauce 

Very well made duck confit.  The mixture of sweet and salty taste is perfect! Duck meat is tender and full of flavor.

- Bucatini Timbale, Kobe Beef Oxtail, Périgord Truffles, Daube Sauce 

The presentation is amazing.  At first it looked like a cup made out of noodles, but once I dug in, the juicy beef center flooded out.  Very flavorful!  Beef tasted unique and out of this world!

Fifth Course: (Desserts)

Well dessert is dessert.  They will fill you up if you are still hungry. :)


Overall, the quality of the food is on par with restaurants at this level and service is excellent.  Highly recommended if you are planning to enjoy a wondering dining experience.",f8qjzrBmZFjSR3AAITmfFA,0,1,5,aH0Og7GZirr58BYYjx0zcw

If we weren't in such a nice restaurant, I would have used my finger to scrape every bit of rice and sauce into my eagerly awaiting mouth!  MMMMMMMM!!!  It's four months later, and I can STILL taste it!

We had the tasting menu, so each course wasn't the biggest, but in the end, we were both severely full.  Although I loved our meal, I think next time I'll opt for the full sized risotto, because it was just that amazing!  

The chocolate souffle was likewise out of this world!  I've never had one quite so soft, airy, and fluffy.  It was like eating a cloud and put all other souffles I've had to shame.  Actually, in retrospect, I can't say I've ever had a proper souffle, now that I know what they're supposed to be like.

The rest of the meal was very good, but not outstanding.  My duck was a little dry.  The sea bass was nicely done.  I don't remember much else.  On that note, I'd probably rate the food a 4 or a 4.5.  The risotto and souffle were 10's, so that evens out to 5 overall.  

Regardless, service was impeccable.  We were waited on hand and foot and made to feel as though we were the only two in the restaurant.  Every dish was explained, from ingredients to eating etiquette, and there was just the perfect amount of personal conversation to make it seem as though we were all friends and that the staff really cared about who we were.  Immaculate!  I've never had such service!  They even matched our dinner napkins to our clothing colors!  So crazy!

It was a lovely (albeit pricey) birthday dinner from the boyfriend!  Le Cirque is a lovely restaurant for a special occasion, and it's perfectly situated for an after-dinner show with Cirque.  :)",lufa4bHQd3XLYQE1zXis0g,3,0,5,Gm0zxwnALIF2uNWGF6VdjA

I came here I think 20 years ago and remember it fondly. 
You get to see the fountain show from the windows. 
It is a price fixed menu with 3-10 course meals. 
Plus they give you lots of extras. 
They gave us a very interesting vegan egg dish in a real egg shell. 
Then after dessert they gave us more dessert... macaroons, a black berry jelly candy and a passion fruit marshmallow. They even gave more more to take home. 
I didn't even talk about the food. I had a fish with a wonderful cream lemon sauce. It was incredible.

1335876,2013-05-21,10,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Perfect. My boyfriend and I ate at Le Cirque on May 17th for his birthday. We had the degustation menu, we ordered different plates, he had the Premium Wine Pairing and I had the Sommelier to taste as many wines and plates as possible. The food was perfectly prepared, nothing over or undercooked, perfect textures and flavors. I won't go through every dish because I don't feel like writing a novel (I will, please read the whole thing, it's quite funny) but everything was perfect.

The food was perfect, but the wine pairings and the service just brought the experience through the roof. I've had many degustation/tasting menus and wine pairings and have never had such perfect selections for each dish. They elevated everything without taking away from the food. The sommeliers (Tom and Frederick?.. I'm not positive about the names) were really just walking encyclopedias of wine and liquor. The service was absolutely perfect. You never ran out of water, the timing between dishes was perfect, they were attentive without being intrusive and were friendly and personable which is a nice reprieve. My biggest complaint for most ""fancy"" restaurants is that I always felt like if I breathed wrong I would be escorted out and black carded and that the servers were too uptight... simply robots reciting the same thing over and over. The service was perfect and personable.  

My only disappointment for the evening is partly my fault because the menu lists a ""dessert fantasy"" and I am um... a uh.. fiend for sweets. I'm a pastry cook. And an oversized child with a paycheck. So when I read ""dessert fantasy"" in my mind I'm thinking the lights go out, the sparklers go off whilst servers dance around me (somehow the floor is now an ice rink and they are in fact ice skating now) placing hundreds of desserts/pastries on my table and each time I take a bite the dessert would morph into a new one, maybe Willy Wonka joins me... but that's my fault. The reality (the worst part of anything) is you get to order a dessert from the dessert menu.. I kind of wish they had an option where you could have a tiny bite of every single one because well.. I wanted to try every single dessert ever. However, dessert was whimsical, delicious and perfect. 

I honestly wish I could've tipped 100% for the service and convinced the higher ups to reward them raises, but alas I am without power. /sigh. You will not be disappointed by choosing Le Cirque. If you truly love food and wine (as in, passionate and legit get a little turned on by good food) then you will marry Le Cirque. In fact, you will be smiling/giggling like a complete lunatic the whole time during your dining experience and will probably be smiling the whole evening afterwards. I'm pretty sure anybody that saw us thought we were high on um... not life. But we were high on Le Cirque.

I apologize for abusing the word perfect. IT WAS PERFECT! PEEERFEEECT!!",e1JOoxgoDKPhPeI5QVlyrA,8,6,5,4PGoPeUAlXTr7vqT77nSOA

The place feels old school upscale though the staff don't make it feel stuffy. They are all very friendly and attentive. The sommelier was really good at chatting with the group and not being overbearing but still being really engaging. He was super generous with the pours and even gave extra when we were sharing some tastes.

We tried both the theater pre-fixe menu and the regular 3 course pre-fixe. The walnut bread is amazing -- couldn't get enough. For the theater menu, we got the steak tartare which had a tad more mustardy taste than I'd like but was beautifully presented and was delicious. The potato encrusted sea bass was phenomenal -- truly a unique experience that I'd highly recommend. The chocolate ball was also amazing presentation and filling. For the regular pre-fixe, the foie gras was excellent and a generous size. The bouillabaisse was elegant though only good (especially compared to the sea bass). The soufflé was good but not great compared to the chocolate ball.

1399244,2012-05-03,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I learned a valuable life lesson in my recent trip to Le Cirque - when venturing into the category of restaurants that go over $100 per person before wine, the return to the dollar diminishes greatly the more you go over that $100.

Don't get me wrong, the food was spectacular, the atmosphere exquisite. The service? Well, we'll get to that. 

My husband and I went to Le Cirque for a blow-out meal on our honeymoon. I guess the first sign we were in over our heads was when the maitre'd replaced my white napkin with a black one in order not get get white lint on my black dress. Nice touch, that. My husband started looking at the menu, while I looked at the wine list. To my horror, there was not a single wine by the glass for less than $20. I did not see a bottle for less than $65. This, by the way, was also a bottle of wine I purchase regularly at my podunk backwater town's liquor store for about $18 a bottle. I get that wine gets marked up in restaurants, but come on Le Cirque. 

Because it was a special occasion, we decided to go with the tasting menu. The first two courses were dynamite. One was an sea urchin with sea urchin foam on lemongrass gelee that I am still dreaming of. The next was a very lovely foie gras with rhubarb that sent shudders of pleasure down my spine. These were the last courses that I really felt were worth what we were paying. 

The following fish and main courses were excellent, truly, and executed to perfection, but they were nothing I could not have accomplished in my own kitchen with enough time and money. (I am, I will concede, a trained chef.) We enjoyed them, and the presentations were lovely (a checkerboard of carrot and spring onion atop a piece of sea bass particularly springs to mind), but I have had more creative menus at far lesser restaurants. 

Things got bumpy with the service when they skipped the cheese portion of our tasting menu and went straight to dessert. Once we realized they had forgotten an entire portion of our meal, we had already been served a (decadent and delicious) chocolate souffle and creme brulee. I politely told a waiter (not ours, we hadn't seen our waiter in quite some time) that a course had been skipped, and he did not believe me. My husband had to convince him that, yes, we had indeed ordered the tasting menu and, yes, a course had been skipped.

Now, normally, I would not have made much of a fuss about this. I am a reasonable person, I know how difficult the restaurant industry is, and let's face it, we were pretty stuffed already. However, when I am paying $135 per person _just for the food_ I don't think I am unreasonable in expecting almost perfection. After much hemming and hawing, trying to bring out the cheese after dessert (YUCK!), trying to give us the cheese to go (um, we're staying in a hotel room with no fridge and we're going to a show after this), trying to bring out those little red boxes they bring to everyone like it's something special (sorry, I know we look like hicks, but we're actually pretty sophisticated and won't be fooled that easily), the waiter brought out the maitre 'd who was one of the toughest-looking customers I have ever seen in my entire life. No wonder the waiter didn't want to tell him what had happened - he was probably afraid of him! 

After more wrangling and finagling, my husband agreed to a $50 comp to the bill - the cost of our two glasses of wine. 

I gave Le Cirque three stars for this. I remember an old review Ruth Reichl wrote of the original Le Cirque in New York where she went to the restaurant twice - once as herself and once as a ""regular Jane"" off the street. Needless to say, her experiences were vastly different. I feel, had my husband and I appeared more moneyed or been someone famous, our treatment would have been entirely different. 

I am glad I had this experience. I learned a lot about myself and a lot about a level of establishment I had long coveted. I won't be back.",XiZX1MYGNN0SLpR7jlXGIA,6,0,3,Bt8kIT9_KPPVjLa7Y9dZAw

1505513,2017-06-28,5,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I finally returned after a nine-year hiatus.

I'd been wondering all this time if a second dinner experience would live up to that magical first time in 2008. To recap, Le Cirque was my first ever Michelin-starred dinner (back when Las Vegas published a guide). Since then, I've experienced others and now have a better point of reference of what should be expected. I'm happy to say that it's still an excellent restaurant despite Michelin's departure. 

We were a group of four. I wouldn't initially describe the decor as timeless, but the whimsical and showy look has stood the test of time. Upon checking in, the hostess happily welcomed me back and pointed out to me the many staff members who still worked there. 

Once at the table, service began and spotlessly continued throughout. We spoke to the sommelier at length about the type of wines we like and our desired price range. We also mentioned we wanted to learn more about French varietals. As expected, he chose the perfect bottle for us.   

WHAT WE TRIED:

Citrus Risotto
St- Germain Flambéed Foie Gras
Burgundy Snails
Potato Crusted Mediterranean Sea-Bass
Diver Scallops
Colorado Lamb
Classic Crème Brûlée
Chocolate Ball

We all chose items from the 3 Course Prix-Fixe Menu. In addition, Le Cirque provided complimentary courses; started with an amuse bouche (a custard inside an eggshell), received a palate cleanser before dessert (a fun candy shell that popped easily to reveal a sweet liquid interior), and ended with mignardise treats (macarons and marshmallows). I enjoyed every dish I tried. Presentation style varied per dish: some more innovative than others. The highlight dish for me was the foie gras. The tapioca and sesame added an unexpected crispness to the silky yet firm consistency. The sweetness of the St-Germain and elderflower syrup complemented the dish nicely. I loved the presentation of the seabass. A thick layer of potato wrapped around the fish stabilizing it and making it simple to scoop all of the flavorful ingredients in one swift move. 

There were a couple of misses. Unfortunately, my girlfriend didn't enjoy her scallops and only ate one of the three served. I can't recall why she didn't mention it while there; I'm sure they would have offered to remedy the situation. Lastly, I thought the crème brûlée didn't quite fit in given its dated simplicity (although I did enjoy the cheeky plating). Then again, it IS listed as a ""classic""...so I suppose we were warned? 

Chef Wilfried Bergerhausen brings a skilled hand to Le Cirque. While the menu still lists classic dishes, it's nice to see the newer ones added. The key here is just how flawlessly and successfully both the work together. Overall, I enjoyed my second visit and recommend adding it to your bucket list if you haven't yet tried it. 

P.S. The purse holders are still there...and I still have my original one.",-xr__Zqgwqhsfx0ThCn-ag,12,7,5,uuEcWdUn9rfe-ioWJ8f4xQ

The magnificent sauces they give you are just perfect and every course that follows the appetizers just get better and better.

For dessert I ordered the chocolate sphere, he ordered the fruit with sorbet and coconut creme served in a coconut.  His by far was better...

The wine pairings were fine, not fabulous but OK... but we are picky wine drinkers. 

The only issue was the timing with the lamb/venison course... we must have waited 30 minutes (I'm not exaggerating), which then made us rush the dessert course, making no time for dessert wine/cheese/coffee or anything else (we had show tickets for 9pm, keep in mind are reservations were at 630 and we were timely).

I'll just give him a quick shout out, he gel his hair up and he had blond/brown hair and possibly in his late 30s to 40? Idk this review is a bit overdue now so the memories aren't as fresh anymore but I had thought I had to give Le Cirque a 5 star review when I left the restaurant. 

We all got the set meal(Prix-fixe menu for $105, I will simply go through what I got because they review will get too long if I write about my two friends got too haha) and although the price was a bit step hence the four $$$$ sign, I think it's definitely worth the money(possibly for special occasions like birthdays and such). I had their beef/steak tartare which was on par with Craftsteak's steak tartare and stand out possibly even a bit more simply because they give you fried beef tendon instead of crostini. Their fried beef tendon was exceptional(a bit too oily but it was the best tasting fried beef tendon I've had) and it worked so well with the steak tartare. 

Among that amazing steak tartare, this is also a must and I'm not kidding. If this is your first time at Le Cirque, I recommend everybody to try their potato crusted Mediterranean Sea bass. From the sauce, to the potato crust, to their beautiful sea bass...everything was exquisite and unique. The potato crust was lightly crispy while having a juicy and perfectly cook sea bass. This potato crust is so different from any other place that I just have to recommend this to any first timer before you try anything else. I won't forget you...potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass :). 

What stand out more is when you have a fix menu, I feel like I always get disappointed on the dessert. Le Cirque exceed expectations and gave me one of the best chocolate Souffle I've had. It wasn't only the best souffle or one of the best souffle I've had, but it was a big souffle that really puts you in the right spot after your appetizers and entree. The entree kinda leave you a little to be desire in terms of being full and this really hit the spot in terms of hitting the flavors and making you happy. There are no ways to describe this fluffy hot souffle that hit every level of excellence and that's all I'll say. 

I'll give another shout out to the excellent waiter who also exceed all expectations just like the dinner had. The waiter makes jokes with us, took time to talk to us even though they're busy, let us see the recipe book(which they have at the restaurant), and gave us other desserts(but you'll probably be too full to eat after that wonderful souffle). I wish I had got your name but just know you did an excellent job just like the food had satisfied me in every way.

Was in LV for a ""Girls Weekend"" with my oldest friend.  We had tickets to ""O"" at 7:30, so were walking around the Bellagio looking at what our dinner options would be around Noon-ish.  Walked past Le Cirque and saw they were advertising a ""Pre-Show Menu"".  I immediately got on my iPhone to see if I could swing reservations, fully expecting not a cold chance in hell.  I mean-- it's LE CIRQUE.

But, there they were, was able to get us in at 6.  (Just 2 of us...)  We actually ended up getting there early (you never know how long it'll take to get a cab/get through the strip during rush hour) and they seated us right away.  

This was one of the most elegant restaurants I've ever eaten at.  We opted for the Pre-Show dinner with wine pairing, which was an AMAZING deal at $95/each.  I got the Risotto to start and the Sea Bass.  My friend also got the risotto and opted for the Rabbit for her main course.  Everything was phenomenal!!! 

Then, for dessert-- they bring us a mini silver tray with Petit Fours and a really large Chocolate Souffle and a small cocounut filled with a coconut-pineapple sorbet-- all for us to share.  OH MY GOD.  Just amazingly decadent.

If you have the chance to eat here-- go, go, go.  And as we left, they handed us the most adorable little keepsake box with truffles inside.

But then, I saw there were mushrooms-a-plenty via truffles on the menu, so I knew it was not a dream. While fungi do not float my boat, all would still be fine, because options in Le Cirque's Degustation Prefixed menu with wine pairings permitted me (mostly) to select other more palatable items.

The soup for my Amuse Bouche was flavored like a corn succotash (it tasted similarly in a later dish). Chilled and good.

Next one was already my favorite -- their Osetra Caviar Trio! Included Smoked Salmon Rillette with Vodka Cream; Capellini with Poached Quail Egg, Shiso, Lemon Vinaigrette; Kumamoto Oyster, Granny Smith Apple, Lemon Verbena Mousse. A dramatic liquid nitrogen effect occurred as cold vapors rose through pores under the plate, encompassing the dish for several minutes before dissolving away. The delicate smoked salmon tasted scrumptious!

Here's where the succotash returns from earlier... The Florida Frog Legs included Potato Gnocchi, Corn Succotash, Parmesan, Lardons, Broccolini, Micro Mizuna. My second time trying frog legs ever, this was a much more flavorful version and the only caveat was how quickly it ceased as I consumed this quickly. Frog legs were similar to chicken in texture but distinctive enough to be recognized as their own thing -- try them here, if you get a chance.

Next up was the Atlantic Cod en Croûte, Ratatouille, Kalamata Olives, Tomato Confit, Potato Pearls, Baby Octopus, Sauce Vierge. This was an okay item -- I did enjoy it and the octopus appealed to me -- it just didn't engage me like the previous dishes had.

My last main dish was their Organic Roasted Chicken, with Asparagus, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Roasted Baby Potatoes, Sauce Vin Jaune. Here's the one time I couldn't avoid le fungi... But their roasted chicken was quite good. May have been a bit heavy on using potatoes (let alone mushrooms), but it's all a matter of opinions.

Our Palette Cleanser: Lime flavored shaved ice. Very refreshing -- didn't think I could possibly have any room left but it didn't feel heavy to consume.

1671601,2008-01-28,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque gets huge points for being super vegetarian friendly, sort of.  When I was first seated, I asked the waiter what my vegetarian options were.  The only one on the menu was a mixed green salad and there was no way that I would order that for $100 dinner.  So, French-waiter-man rattled off some options and when he got to truffle pasta or truffle risotto my dining companions got all giddy.  I decided on ravioli for a starter and, based on peer pressure, truffle risotto for my main dish.  
The ravioli was really good, but the sauce was supposed to be herb-something and instead was butter thickened with butter (much like at Cuistot).  
The risotto was a large portion completely covered with truffles.  It was incredibly rich and very good, but I could only eat about 1/3, so I took the rest home.  
Some of the dessert options were odd - strawberry soup?  Midori melon something? They do have souffles, which one in my party ordered.  It was fine but nothing fantastic.  The coffee ice cream was fine but nothing fantastic. I had a praline mousse which was also, nothing fantastic.  I think the goal might be to be totally full by the time dessert comes because it wasn't that exciting.  Most of the petit fours received the table's approval except a yucky strawberry-marshmallow-thing.
As for the basics, the bread basket is good - rustic white, olive or pretzel bread.  They push water like you wouldn't believe.  If you order sparkling water for a table of four, they automatically bring out two bottles and fill large glasses completely full which is kind of annoying.  Also annoying is how they are constantly fussing over you, pouring a splash of wine because you took one sip.  My least favorite of all fussing is when they fold your napkin/replace your napkin while you are off in the restroom.

SO THEN THE CHECK COMES and there is a $62 surcharge for the truffle risotto.  No one said anything about a surcharge when offering truffle risotto as a vegetarian option.  I get that truffles are expensive, but rice isn't, so the only ingredient that cost any money in my risotto was the truffles.  $170 for ravioli, risotto and mousse, really?

I was incredibly fortunate to be invited by some friends to go on a Vegas vacation for a couple days and on our first night, we were treated like spoiled princes and princesses at Le Cirque. 

The restaurant is very high class with such an authentic Parisian atmosphere. I've traveled to Paris twice and I can quite honestly say that this little restaurant tucked away in the busy Bellagio casino lives up to its international competition. I was completely blown away by their menu. Our party ordered four different appetizers our waiter so knowledgeably recommended. You can't go to a French restaurant and not order the escargot. And their lobster risotto was just mouth-watering delicious (this was just the appetizer!) Let's not forget the yellowtail hamachi and scallops.....dude this place was unreal. 

For entrees, we each ordered something different (our party of 10). I ordered the duck and my GOODNESS I was floored by how tender and flavorful it was. There was a breaded and fried grape (singular) on the side as well. You could probably imagine my surprise when I cut this little fried ball in half to discover a green and sweet center. Seriously, what a delight. I also tried my friend's kobe beef. I LOVE kobe beef and this place just upped it to a whole new level of love. 

Dessert. My kryptonite. I shared a chocolate sphere with a friend. If you're ever as lucky as me, I highly HIGHLY recommend the chocolate sphere. The description of the dessert described this as ""hazelnut ice cream with caramel nougat enveloped in a chocolate shell"". Okay yeah, sounds good. But it's very deceiving because when our waiter served the dessert, he made a little joke asking us ""do you like the sphere?"" (it literally came as a chocolate sphere the size of a large fist). Then he proceeds to tell us, ""yeah you like it? well I'm going to destroy it"". I honestly got a little sad when he said this but THEN he pours hot melted chocolate on top of our sphere and the whole chocolate sphere begins to melt all around, revealing the hazelnut ice cream in the center. The effect was never-before-seen. And plus, each girl received a small chocolate box. Like seriously, this place was unbelievably delicious and it was one of the most surreal experiences I've ever been apart of. I owe it all to my friends who made it possible. 

I apologize for pulling a Tim Lam (he writes the longest reviews) but this place deserves high praise. In all honesty, this was the best dinners I've ever had at a restaurant (I emphasize ""restaurant"" because my mom cooks like a culinary goddess) and it wasn't even because I had two martinis plus champagne :]

Le Cirque is a well regarded transplant from New York City.  It is a French restaurant, but it is a much less formal dining experience than Joel Robuchon or Guy Savoy.  The restaurant's decor is a signature element.  The room is covered in circus murals and even the ceiling is a tent canopy to really create a circus-esque atmosphere (albeit a high end one).

Several menu options are available.  There is a six course tasting menu (where you have some choices) as well as a 3-course a la carte starter, entree and dessert option.  A fast pre-theater menu (of 3 courses) is also available.

I went with the 3-course a la carte menu and added an extra starter.  The meal started with a trio of salmon amuses.  There was salmon tartare with roe, salmon gravlax with honey and dill, and smoked salmon atop a potato waffle.  All of the amuses were good and really showcased the salmon.

There was a wide variety of bread options.  I chose the pretty good bacon baguette.  I also had the French bread, which had a pretty good chew.

I started with the white alba truffle risotto, which was expensive but very good.  The risotto rice was very nicely cooked.  It was al dente with a noticeable bite.  The risotto was creamy and had a good Parmesan flavor (some might find it a tad too strong or salty). 

The white truffles were great--very nice flavor and strong aroma.  The truffles were not as good as the ones I had in DC at CityZen, but that could just be because white truffle season is ending. The only thing that could have been better was the presentation.  They should have shaved the truffles tableside.

If you do not want to pay the supplemental charge or are not a fan of truffles, a good lobster risotto is also available.

I also had the sautéed foie gras and it was nowhere near as delicious.  The foie gras was undercooked and it was not the best quality.  It was very broken and there were quite a few strands in it.  It was creamy but not that smooth.

The garnishes were okay.  I liked the crunch and flavor of the almonds.  I also liked the pineapple tart though it was a very small portion.  The quinoa was kind of just bland mush.

You can definitely see the difference between Le Cirque's foie gras (the first link) and Picasso's foie gras (the second link), which is much more refined, simple and clean (Picasso is also located in the Bellagio).

My entree was a butter poached lobster tail and the lobster itself was nicely cooked.  It was very fresh and was mostly soft (a little tough in parts).  I really liked the garnish of caviar--a generous portion and very fishy, briny and salty.

The base of the lobster was a vanilla emulsion and I did not like it.  The sweetness and the very pronounced flavor of the vanilla kind of ruined the dish.  The garnishes of cauliflower and broccoli were average.

There was also a side dish of pomme purée, mushrooms and lobster meat.  This was messy, but it was good upscale comfort food.

For dessert, I oped for the grand mariner soufflé, but I should have ordered the chocolate soufflé instead.  The baking of the soufflé was very good.  It had a nice lift and it was airy, light and moist.  The flavor of the grand mariner was too strong.  It was a very powerful flavor and the strong punch of alcohol diffused any sweetness this dessert had.

The meal ended with some mignardises including a pretty good cream-filled profiterole (with a hard candy-esque topping), a blueberry financier, a lemon meringue tart (similar to the ones they have at Platine in Culver City), and a caramelized fig tart.

Service was good.  The food came out at a quick pace and the staff was pleasant and attentive.  I did feel the service was a little rushed at times; Le Cirque's service just did not have the smooth ease of Bellagio's Picasso.

Prices were high, but that is to be expected given Le Cirque's location.  The food is about in the same price range as Picasso and I think the food at Picasso is much more refined, elegant and exquisite.

Le Cirque is a decent French restaurant.  It reminds me of La Folie and Gary Danko in terms of menu items and quality.  I think you could probably have a satisfying French dinner here, but it will probably not be worth the high price (like most Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,29,19,3,MXdP2nvY5rkSM26A9LansA

Spending our last dinner in vegas, My marine took me to this resto. Since it was in the hotel we were staying in.
I have remembered being to this place before, LONG time ago with friends.  How can I forget, the stars on the wall right before you open the door to this establishment.  

This resto has ONLY pre fix menus.
We ordered the 3 course pre fix- appetizer, entrée and dessert.
I had the Maryland blue crab (which cost extra) He had the Hamachi.  Both were delicious.  Portions are small but savory.  
Main course- Sea Bass and he had the 4oz Japanese Wagyu filet (also cost per pound) 
OMG, that wagyu just melts in your mouth!!! Like butter!
For dessert: crème brulee and ice cream.  The resto gave us macarons on the side.  MY FAVORITE! Pistachio macarons! 

Ohhh and the view is great, you get to watch the fountain show right from your seat!

1733194,2010-12-21,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"What an amazing meal. I had a multi foodgasmic experience. Haven't had my taste buds lit up like this in awhile.

I have been to some good restaurants and I would like to give my compliments to Le Cirque, especially for being in Las Vegas. Because of the high tourist traffic many times the quality just isn't there at these fancy Vegas restaurants, not so here. 

We had the Degustation Menu, or Chefs Menu. 

Amuse-Bouche: Japanese oyster with salmon roe, very different, very good. First course lobster salad. mmm mmm mm. Served with truffle sauce and a few slices of black truffle. Second course foie gras with butterscotch and white chocolate? Are you nuts? It was AMAZINGLY good, hats off. Paupiette Le Sea Bass came next. I heard you can't even order this dish at le cirque new york, luckily its included here. The potato and fish were seared to a perfect crisp. Pinot Noir wine sauce deliciously complex. Second main course consisted of honey glazed duck. Get it medium rare if you like a bit more flavor. Candied pear was a perfect compliment to the fatty duck. Screw the $65 Kobe beef add-on its just a fad. 

May I suggest a Lewis Vineyards 2004 Reserve to wash it all down with? This is a fabulous bottle, but you gotta bring it cause its not on the wine list. 

Pre dessert was a delicious sorbet. Really cleansed the palate. 

For dessert they treated us so well. They brought our table (of 4) four different desserts! So didn't have to.  Molten chocolate cake, yuzu ice cream, peach souffle, and a sort of raspberry sorbet. They served up some petit fours as well. 

Everything was amazing and made with the upmost care and complexity. Service was top notch just like a good french restaurant would be. Atmosphere and decor are beautiful. Completely worth the money spent here. Cheers!",NE1edqG0EMyzevbgfU6FDA,2,0,5,ZD2ma8-gqlxl-Yks7UR_9Q

But based on the reviews in Yelp, as well as recommendation from a friend,  we made a reservation at Le Cirque. Le Cirque was a huge disappoinment. We had a 9:15 reservation on a Friday night, we were promptly seated and the place was about 3/4 full. The wait staff, was not overtly friendly or energetic, nor very efficent, kind of like our entire experience there. I felt that perhaps the Le Cirque once had her day, but is now worn and in need of an eclectic upgrade (think Gordon Ramsey).

We ordered a bottle of Cakebread Sauv Blanc and it was poured near room temperature, this to me is a fatal error for a high end French eatery, I asked them to bring a bucket of ice to the table which they did without complaint, is was drinkable in about 30 minutes.

We ordered the 4 course tasting menu, eh...just not impressed. The snow crab apettizer was decent, but just as in any good sushi place. The next course was a tiny piece of Foi Gras, which has carmelized and served over crisp bread, perhaps the best part of the meal, as the John Dory was cooked dry, and way under seasoned, think Tilipia. The Rabbit breast was again cooked to sawdust dry, tasteless. My wife had the Duck Breast which I tried, it was much better, but an extremley small portion.

The other thing, and I noticed other Yelper's commnented on it, was the long wait between courses, at times uncomfortably long. Our entire dinning experience was 2 hours and 45 minutes.

1789919,2016-08-14,2,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I had a tough decision on booking Le Cirque for dinner, a few hours before Le Reve at Wynn.  The restaurant has been around 18 years, virtually day one since Bellagio opened.  Very good Yelp reviews (though none among my Yelp friends), a Michelin Star, and top rankings from various local ""best Vegas restaurants"" lists and blogs.  The first red flag was my coworker buddy who ate here a week before who commented meh - French food that does not compare to Le Pigeon in Portland.  Nonetheless, I took the gamble and booked here anyways.

Overall I felt the dinner was good, but not excellent. I liked the small, intimate restaurant next to the Bellagio fountains, and the cute circus-themed art and colorful decorations.  Service was excellent along with the wine glasses suggested by our sommelier.  It was the execution of the 5-course tasting menu that was slightly uneven and the quality-to-price ratio that drove me to the 3-star rating overall.  The 5-course menu gives you more dishes, but portions seem smaller than going ala carte or many even the 3-course menu.  Plus they have several dishes with price supplements that can easily increase the price!

Excellent aspects:
+ The bread service.  Wow the coffee-chocolate bread sounds like dessert and is borderline sweet, but man did that taste good.  Next is the bacon roll!

+ Australian Truffle Risotto.  Superb, creamy, and surprisingly not to rich.  Several generous pieces of shaved black truffle but expect to pay a whopping $40 supplement.

+ Foie Gras of course, and it works so well with cherries and cherry amaretto sauce.

+ Service from the waitstaff and sommelier were definitely friendly and Michelin-worthy.

Good aspects:
+ Potato stuffed sea bass was a small portion, so perhaps that is why it seemed slightly overcooked and you really need to eat it with the wine reduction.  Excellent leeks!

+ Diver scallop was perfectly cooked and served in a shell with lobster bisque.  Its just one for a $19 supplement, so a bit pricey.

+ Colorado lamb - Meaty and cooked well.  I liked the veggie sides and the sauce.  

+ Chilled Corn Soup - Interesting and colorful, and has some crunch from the buckwheat popcorn and some sweetness from vanilla snow.

+ The raspberry parfait dessert was nice, with lychees and raspberries adding a nice surprise.

Mediocre aspects:
+ 3-oz A5 Wagyu Beef - At a $105 supplement we were hoping to be blown away, but sadly while some portions were indeed juicy and soft, the ends seemed drier and overcooked.  The A5 we had at Carmel's Aubergine (a 4 oz) literally melted in our mouth, while the Le Cirque version required some chewing.  Flavors were good, but the execution on texture didn't seem up to par.

+ Panna Cotta - presentation was beautiful, and the custard was good.  Somehow biting into the pears in the dish gave me the feeling that they felt canned, but that may be just me.

Overall, I think Le Cirque is good, but for the price I think L'Atelier is a far better option.  With all the supplements, our 5-course tasting menu with 2 glasses wine, 1 coffee, and tax and tip came to about $600 for two.  The 10-course tasting menu at L'Atelier was less than that and there every course was awesome.",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,11,3,3,AAAp_fjLbVqScy0Ht7uSyw

1814856,2009-07-01,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"An upfront warning - these events happened a few years ago. This isn't meant to be a current review, but an overview of the class and integrity of the restaurant and its management. 

As gourmands, my wife and I enjoy Las Vegas for it's abundance of high quality restaurants.  The couple we were with are of the same mind, so we visited Le Cirque with high expectations. The decor (circus tent ala Donald Trump), service and food were all that we had hoped for - until my wife noticed her entree wasn't what she ordered. 

She had ordered the Sonoma Lamb; when it came, it looked suspiciously like veal.  My wife doesn't eat veal, so we call the waiter over for confirmation.  Sure enough, they had run out of lamb and the chef had substituted (without asking) the veal.  Our waiter said this was SOP for the restaurant - the chef decided what to serve if your order wasn't available. 

Naturally my wife was irritated, and sent back the entree for another lamb order.  The rest of us had finished our dinners before hers came back - and it was the sorriest piece of meat I've seen served this side of Denny's.  Since I had initially encouraged her to accept the veal, this became my fault and the evening was ruined.  We ended up paying the bill (a small fortune) and leaving no tip for the waiter. 

When we got home I wrote letters of complaint to the Bellagio, Le Cirque Las Vegas, and the original Le Cirque in New York.  Imagine my surprise when I received a response from all three.  New York's response came first, and offered a free lunch whenever we were in town.  Then Las Vegas' letter came in the mail, offering a complimentary dinner the next time we visited.

It was a few months later, but we returned to the Bellagio and took them up on the offer.  My wife got her Sonoma Lamb, I got a Staglin Cellars cab (which I expected to pay for), and we got the dining experience we had hoped for the first time - all comped.  The icing on the cake was that our waiter from the first time was standing in the corner - we called him over and gave him the tip he deserved from the first meal.

The night before we dined at Joël Robuchon and Le Cirque was much better. If you have to choose between one and the other, Le Cirque is the way to go. 

The staff is first-rate. Everone we encountered was very professional and at the top of their game. Everyone involved with table service had been there since the Las Vegas location opened back in 1974. That says a lot about what a quality place this is.

We ordered off the pre-theater menu. $72 a person. There are ample choices and it's substantially less than the regular menu. It's only available from 5:00pm-5-:45pm. 

We ended up ordering off both the pre-theater menu ($72) and the prix-fixe menu ($108). Whatever you order, the courses must match. For instance, everyone at the table must have a three-course dinner, five-course dinner, etc. You can order off different menus, as long as it's the same number of courses for each person. 

For starters, they bring over the bread. You must have the chocolate coffee bread.Trust me, it's a must try. I could have just eaten that bread and been perfectly satisfied. 

I'm not going to go into great detail about the food. It was all excellent and well presented. I had the Rabbit Symphony. It was very rich and pretty salty. I would almost knock off a star for it, but everything else was so terrific, I'm still sticking with my five stars.

My friend had the potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass. She sent it back because she didn't know the potato was fried. (I told you she's picky!) They allowed her to order the diver scallops off the prix-fixe menu and still only charged us pre-theater price. We didn't ask them to do that, but it was a very nice gesture on their part, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back because of how splendidly they handled the situation. Above and beyond! Bravo Le Cirque!!

For dessert, I had the Petite Boule de Chocolat, Eclats de Noisette Caramélisée, Glace Chocolat Blanc"", which translates to Chocolate Ball. YouTube this one. It's a really fun dessert to watch transform when they pour hot chocolate over it. 

If you want a truly memorable fine dining experience, and you like French food, this is a wonderful choice when you are in Las Vegas.

Cute dishes with their name on it and the walls of the dining room are adored with circus primates on each screen (monkeys and chimps) with a tent celining. 
If you ask for a window view, you can see the Bellagio fountains.

The amuse bouche was this delicious chopped tartare of fish. 
Hubby paid extra for the authentic Japan-raised Wagyu beef sold by the oz.  He got 5 oz. We both agreed that's one of the best tasting cuts of meat we've ever tried and they cooked it just perfectly.  The outside was seared and crunchy and the meat was very tender. He thought it practically melted in your mouth. I wouldn't go as far as that to say it melted, but it could easily be consumed by someone without teeth and had to gum it.  

I had an appetizer of Yellowtail hamachi, thin slices of fish which was tender and I could've eaten more of it. My entree was a Mediterranean seabass surrounded in a potato crust.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  Dessert was a wonderful milk chocolate souffle'. The souffle' was fluffy and soft served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cream anglaise.  

Hubby had a very tender foie gras appetizer.  His dessert of lychee ice cream with raspberry was also very good.  They offered 5 different slices/rolls of bread but we tried 3:  French, a great chedder bacon roll and chocolate/coffee which could've been dessert by itself. 

Just really good food and if not for the hefty price tag, I'd eat there every night in Vegas and get really fat.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,1,0,4,X90Q9iTKNYetd4rhyz_EYw

I'm sorry, but eating in a circus tent with flying colors and crazy rainbow stripes all over the place is a little much. I get it - it's a circus, (for the love of God, themed design AGAIN) but why not use decor that reflects a different aspect of the circus, how about caged animals? I think that might make more sense. 

So - the food was fabulous here dahrling....just as you'd expect it to be. The best part of the night?

My only complaint was with the wine pairing. Even though we chose the reserve pairing and my wife and I had different dishes we got the exact same wine with each dish. This makes me really wonder if they have a pairing for each dish they have on their tasting menu and if we even got the reserve pairing. I would have expected a different type of wine with each dish that was specifically chosen and paired by the sommelier. 

The place is colorful and some tables have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains when they go off.

We started with drinks at the bar, the bartender was friendly and we thought we were going to have a great evening.  

The décor is fabulous and so much fun, too bad the wait staff seemed grumpy and put out to be there.  Our table was small and on a crowded wall, it felt more like a bistro table than a fine dining experience.  I don't know why they sat 3 couples in a row on this wall given that there were other open tables that were never filled while were dined.  

We opted for the full tasting menu and the highlights were the amuse bouche and the cheese plate.  Nothing stood out and I was most disappointed by the signature sea bass, it was kind of dry.  While I don't expect to love everything on a tasting menu I expect at least one standout dish that blows my mind.  Not a single standout.

The service was terrible, don't know if we just got the B team or what but it was just off, here are some examples:

- waiters calling out to each other across the room
- the servers standing at our table waiting to put down our dishes because no one came around with new silverware
- a lovely fork with bent prongs

This is one of the few restaurants on the Strip that, in my humble opinion, is not overrated. In a nutshell, you will enjoy a fine dining experience with exceptional service.
We came here to Bellagio to enjoy a nicer dinner before watching 'O' and I really had my doubts. But as the night rolled along, the high ratings were justified more and more.
The food:
We had the Prix-Fixe Menu. Started with Steak Tartare, and Japanese Yellowtail. The quail egg added a nice bit of extra flavor to the Tartare, and I love what this place did with Yuzu sauce for the Yellowtail. 
For our main dishes, we got the Spring Colorado Lamb, and the Rabbit Symphony. We decided we wanted to try different things, so that's what we got. The Rabbit was exceptional! I'm absolutely sure that there are many people who cannot bring themselves to eat rabbit for whatever reason, but it was absolutely delectable! 
Lastly for our desserts, we got the Chocolate Ball, and the Chocolate Souffle. The chocolate ball reminded me of a dessert that I had at Sweets Raku over in Chinatown. Very interesting to watch it melt in front of you. 
The Prix-Fixe Menu is about $105 per person. 
The service was over the top! We had multiple servers who were all very knowledgeable about the food (especially the alcohol) and they seem to be very passionate about what they are serving. It made the evening extra fun. I personally hate sleepy restaurants, so I definitely enjoyed this type of environment. 
So why not a perfect 5 stars? We made reservations for 7:30pm and arrived at 7:10pm. So we were asked to sit at the bar or come back closer to our reservation time. We sat at the bar until 7:30, but still were not seated. It didn't look that busy, but we still kept waiting. We finally sat down around 7:50pm. Of course, this isn't some quick eating place, and we need some time to eat here, but we did feel a little rushed because we had to catch our 9:30 showing of 'O' which we were recommended to arrive by 9:15. We ended up making the show on time, but if we weren't seated 20 minutes late, we would have had plenty of time and not felt rushed to enjoy our delicious dinner.
Overall, I highly recommend this place, even if you are a local. Yes, we generally hate going to the Strip, but this is one place to go to especially if you want to take out of town guests someplace nice.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,9,6,4,5A7EwBo2oaFcz-pC5lYgCw

Impeccable service. Devine food. Quiet, relaxing ambiance. 
My only complaint was that the clientele who chose to dine with us there were uptight. There were a few times during our meal that I laughed a decibel too high (i.e., it could be heard from 5 feet away) and our neighboring patrons shot us nasty glances.

Anyway we (ok I ...) decided when were first planning our trip to Las Vegas that I wanted to try Le Cirque.  So we made reservations on OpenTable a few weeks before our trip.  We ended up getting to the Bellagio earlier than I excepted (probably because I decided against walking over from the Venetian in heels) so we stopped by the Hyde (see other review) fro some pre-dinner drinks before heading over to Le Cirque.

Once we arrived we were seated in the lounge/bar area to wait on being seated at our table (again, read: got there early).  We were quickly taken care of and our coats checked so that we weren't carrying them around with us.  After a few minutes of getting my drink in the lounge we were escorted to our table.  Bear in mind if you come here reservations are awesome and the dining area isn't very large - definitely an intimate setting for sure.  (be aware if you are seated near people who speak loud or speak loud people sitting around CAN and likely will eavesdrop).   Service was definitely exceptional - everything was refilled and cleared promptly; nothing was overlooked!

Now for the food...OMG the food...We decided before arriving (maybe more like 2 weeks before...) the DÉGUSTATION menu and it was divine.  The courses were
1.  Japanese yellowtail & Parsnip Veloute
2. Carnaroli Risotto
3. Mediterranean Sea Bass
4. Braised Veal Cheeks & Roasted Organic Chicken
5. Grand Mariner Souffle and Chocolate Souffle 
Not to mention the amazing bread, amuse bouche, palette cleanser, and the assortment of french macaroons.   Dinner was phenomenal,  everything tasted amazing and my favorite thing by far was the exceptional Grand Mariner Souffle!!

Definitely a great place for date night in Vegas (if you are willing to spend the money)!  A word of warning - it does look like a circus inside (duh! Le Cirque) and that was hard for my man to reconcile with an amazing high end restaurant.",SykFoD1kxIbd2OYij8JJqw,0,0,5,IMWeZwMfp1pyxLytFlYtQA

We brought this to the waiter and manager's attention and the manager apologized and said he would make things right and pay for the cleaning.

Both times I order the pre-theater menu. It's a great deal and a great way to try their amazing food. During the two visits, I have had the lobster bisque, the risotto (they were even willing to substitute the lobster risotto for the tomato risotto at no extra cost since I don't like tomato!), the sea bass in pinot noir reduction (twice), and the chocolate sphere which has pieces of real edible gold in it. Definitely get it with the wine pairing! The sommelier is very helpful.  Also, the bread selection is wonderful (e.g., rosemary bread, pretzel bread, bacon bread, etc), and they bring both salted and unsalted butter.

Everything is very tasty, and the service is perfection!  The waiters are attentive.  When the waiter noticed that I was picking the peas out of my risotto, he came running back with a spoon to remove them all from my plate for me so that I ""wouldn't have to look at them"".

2092967,2010-11-09,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I must say, I've eaten at many fine dining restaurants across the world, and after living in Las Vegas for many years now, Le Cirque is definitely THE global standard for upscale French dining.  Yes, it's expensive, but it is definitely worth the money- you can taste the money you're spending, hahahaha, and I mean that in a good way.

First off, the decor is amazing.  I've never seen an establishment pull of a circus-like decor, hence its namesake.  The entire restaurant is eclipsed by a tent-like ceiling made of sheer fabrics of exotic yellows, oranges, and bright vermillions.  The seating is somewhat close to each other, close enough for intimate conversations but not space-invading to the point of intrusion.

From the moment the hostess led us to our table, the front-of-house service ran lack clockwork.  Greeted by the maitre d' and the manager, they were then followed by the sommelier who explained what kind of wine to pick since I was fairly picky about what wine I drink with my food.  Sadly, I don't remember what kind it was- all I know is that it was  Chardonnay.  The busser arrived with fiji water and the server came to explain the menu.  He should've saved his breath- I knew exactly what to order.

So then I ordered from the prix fixe menu.  From the traditional side, I started off with escargot.  I've tasted it before, but I wanted to taste it from a French chef.  It was amazing.  It was like nothing I've ever tasted.  The texted was soft and slightly slimy, but that's because of the juices that the escargot was served with.  My buddy got foie gras (yes, I know, we wanted to go all-out French), and it was also very good.  It didn't taste like typical liver of any sort, but it was definitely a taste that few could appreciate.

For the main course, I got a plate of different sorts of seafood- it had a leg of a crab, scallops, and other crustacean stuff.  It was fairly small- I think the escargot was actually bigger, but no matter- it was still amazing.

I can't remember what dessert I had, probably because it didn't taste like anything special in comparison with the appetizer and the main course, but I did remember the waiter serving us a tray of assorted bon-bons (French word for candy) and a box of truffles for each of us.  The synthetic silk box had two truffles- both very tasty, but the bon-bons was what impressed me.  They were all different; different looking and they tasted different as well.  I asked for another plate of them and they gave it to me in a to-go box!  What amazing service :)

All in all, this is an amazing restaurant.  This will NEVER fail to impress a dinner date, unless she's eaten at somewhere ridiculous like a French restaurant on top of the Pyrenees during springtime with an accordion player playing tableside on the cobblestone street, lavender aromas from the fields nearby grazing your nose while complimenting the taste of your.. bouillabaisse.. straight from the Mediterranean.

So unless you can find that here in Las Vegas, it's best to just stick to the next best thing.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,4,4,5,AGgqCYzTWQP8RFnO4vkbNQ

This already put a bad taste in my mouth (we got you the first 4 times). Well anyways, we arrived at our reservation time and sat us down at the table. They asked us if we wanted drinks (alcoholic) and if we wanted to see the wine list as well. We declined, and told them we had drinks prior to arrival at another location and just wanted tea. The waiter seem to take extreme offense to this and black listed us for the entire meal.

When we called him over, he always had a attitude and was ""shocked"" that we had to ask for something.

But under the guise of it being a special occasion, coupled with the express written consent of their spouses, got them on board.

The $350 menu prestige was a bridge too far for them (and in almost any other circumstance, for me, too), but the 5-course dégustation menu was a nice compromise. I won't bother going into details about the individual courses because the menu will change by the time you visit and the cooking is far beyond what I'm capable of judging in and of itself. As you can tell by the recent five-star rating from Forbes Travel Guide and the Michelin star it's held onto from those few years when Michelin was rating Vegas, the food is going to be good. I will note that the courses were pleasantly leaning a little more vegetable-heavy: there were daikon ""noodles"" in the scallop dish and a cauliflower puree instead of a starch under the veal cheek dish. Not only does this lighten the menu a little bit (not making you feel completely stuffed by the end of the night), but I think it also takes more finesse to prepare. Also, although it's primarily considered a French restaurant, there was Japanese, Thai, and Italian influences on the menu, too, which celebrates the globalization of modern American cooking. Finally, while I've had truffles before, this is the first place I've been where they were used to elevate a dish rather than treat the mushroom like an expensive garnish. 

The food was amazing, and judging by recent reviews in the New York Times, exceeds the mothership that was a staple of fine dining many years ago. No matter how good the food is, (and no matter how many photos I took and menus saved) I'm going to forget about it eventually. Even recalling the finer details of the courses now, a week after our visit, is difficult. What's not going to fade is the memories I have of spending three hours with friends I haven't seen in years and the experience of sharing this well-paced and rightly-proportioned meal with them. How we were treated with the right amount of formality and with impeccable service. Sitting there at the end of this great meal and with a glass of Pappy Van Winkle in my hand and feeling the afterglow of a special night. That's what I'll remember. 

Will Guidara, owner of Eleven Madison Park:

""If you save up your money for something special, you can buy a nicer stereo system, get a nicer car, go to the theater and sit next to the person that you love and not talk to each other. Or, you can take a few hours of your life and create a memory. That's the business I am in: of creating those moments, of making the impossible possible, at least for a few hours.""",rlDDkE6G-nMO-z0hNqekzA,1,1,5,zU9udn1WjrHExLlmgB1RPA

The food presentation for each course was nice same as wine pairings.  However, the taste is lack of complexity and ingredients didn't have much natural flavor.  i am not sure if they have sauce chef on site.

2170211,2012-01-31,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"for a 1 michelin star place, i thought this place would have more to offer. And for vegas standards? this is not at the top of my list.

Service was yes fantastic, my water was never empty, people always asking how my food was, almost to the point it was annoying, but, i'd rather have it then to not have people asking me how my experience is. 

Food? For a 1 michelin star place this food was forgettable. I mean nothing really comes to WOW me, the risotto was good but not the best that i had, the scallops were alright but i live in the Bay Area, nothing special. Foie Grae? I've had it all. So nothing that really wowed me. And Kobe beef? No sir this was not kobe beef and if it was it was trash... I've had kobe beef in Kobe, Tokyo, and elsewhere and this was no better or even close or up to par with Kobe beef. that was an extra $35 i think... 

Dessert? Ahhhh this is where they were saved, the creativity of the pastry/dessert Chef is only rivaled by on that i've been to based on creativity and taste that is Atelier Crenn in SF. Wowed and it tasted really good. 

Price? Expensive. But thats already known, i just wish that i got more for what we paid. 

Overall? Let's say i'd rather have eaten at Picasso for a 3rd time then to eat here for a first (for the $$ spent). But now that i've said i tried it, unless i hear they changed something about it, i don't need to come back. Unless i'm invited to come back and try. So i offer Le Cirque a challenge, come back and show me why your 1 michelin, And change my mind for me.

Tip for ""O"" watchers: The gf almost missed her show because they were running a bit slow. If they say 8PM is alright for the tasting menu to go to the 10PM show? Try making reservations for 7:20. 

Stars? 2.5/5 i'll round up.",BFNVTFyGZZ_IzzWCRpPrbg,0,0,3,BZGpxUzGcLicLkwedc2cCQ

2203778,2014-05-05,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"It's absolute craziness that this place has only 4 stars.

I have had fine dining all over the US and many of the great international dining destinations, and I must say that this is probably one of the top 10 meals I have ever had.

The wine list is rather good, especially if you are interested in library and iconic wines. It is focused a little more on the classically reputable producers, and the major regions, as I suppose that is what the clientele demands. There are some great gems there, and the sommelier is rather gracious in helping you seek them out. It is a little odd that they would serve Veuve by the glass... with such a refined cuisine, it might be more appropriate to serve a wine that is not mass produced to such a high level (but again, that might just be what the clientele demands). 

The thing that impressed me the most about this place is how well thought out all of the dishes were. All of the flavors of each and every item that came out were perfectly balanced. It created a situation where the whole was truly greater than the sum of its parts. The sea bass was perfect. 

the front end staff did such a phenomenal job.... their standard of service was one of the best I have ever encountered. 

oh, and the soufflé... my goodness. We had the chocolate and grand marnier.... both were great, but the grand marnier was phenomenal. Order the soufflés when you first sit because they do run out. The table next to us tried to order towards the end of their meal, and they only had the strawberry soufflé left to order (which was great, I'm sure, but still). It felt a little odd when our soufflés came out as they were paying their bill haha.",7UXIramvX5zFm4LAqLR7UQ,3,3,5,esqiIXBbpZ7Ul2QJAHyIWQ
2208992,2010-12-23,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Probably because I didn't come here as hungry as I would have liked, but the meal fell below my standards. My standards for a meal like this would probably be Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, and Bistro de Paris in Orlando. This isn't to say that Le Cirque wasn't good - I enjoyed my meal, but my expectations were a bit higher than what was delivered to us, because of the service and the food.

The atmosphere is beautiful. You can see the Bellagio water show multiple times through the windows, and the interior is decorated accordingly - like a glamorous circus. I loved the murals, the drapery on the ceiling, and the whole French circus meets designer theme.

Service - I docked a star for this. We were served by many different servers. I was surprised, to say the least; he only time I've ever had that happen is in chain restaurants that I frequent for good happy hour sushi deals. This became a problem when we needed something because we were not sure which server to call over, and they never seemed to come around enough. On top of that, they were polite, prompt, and smooth, but that was it, and at a restaurant of this caliber, I expected much, much more. More description of the dishes, more coming around to check up on us, or maybe introducing your name (oh wait, that would have happened multiple times because we had multiple servers). And no, being French is not an excuse; the other fine French restaurants I've dined at have delivered impeccable, WAY-above-the-bar service, and I have never failed to remember our server's name because they are THAT good.

I got the foie gras saute as an appetizer, le lapin (rabbit) as my main course, and delice de framboise (raspberry sorbert, raspberry milkshake, raspberry gelee) for dessert.

The foie gras was good, but I wish I went with the foie gras au torchon instead; the foie gras was tender and juicy, and the caramel was interesting, though it was not to my liking when the sweet and salty mixed (or rather, clashed) together. The fruit was a great accent and I wish there was more of that flavor to balance out the foie gras, rather than the caramel butterscotch that they used.

The rabbit had nice texture, but was rather heavy. I don't think the roasted loin did anything for the dish in terms of enhancing its flavor, but the ravioli was delicious and new. The flavor was too salty, in my opinion; I kept trying to avoid the riesling sauce whenever I took a bite..

Delice de framboise was near heaven. The sorbet was the perfect texture, and was complemented perfectly by the raspberry milkshake and gelee that it sat upon. Its plating was also gorgeous, in a nestlike bowl atop a pink sugar nest, and with gold flakes and a curved strip of chocolate.

I'm not sure who, but someone definitely escorted us out as we were leaving and cheerily said that they hoped to see us again and that they hoped we enjoyed it and etc., etc. He sounded very friendly, very genuine, and if service had been like that all night, this place would have gotten 4 stars instead of 3 from me.

So, in short, a nice meal with beautiful atmosphere and good food... but service is merely average (not to mention confusing with the multiple servers) and I'm sure that, being in Las Vegas, you could find a finer restaurant that will deliver a finer culinary experience to your taste buds.

Sorry Le Cirque. I wanted to like you so badly, but I was not blown away like I wanted to be (so, so badly). Maybe it was cause I was wearing jeans and a jacket and had no time to change and dress up... but to be fair, my jeans alone cost more than our entire meal (so you can't say I dressed like a cheapass and that's why I got subpar service, haha).",ileI06mnGv32dYOk3Qwmmg,0,1,3,790aDF9Sr8c2AXtIo__vEg

They have a few menus you can choose from. We went with the safe middle option - 5 courses, which was just the right amount of food. They also have a 10 course option, which in our experience of multi-course tasting menus means - roll us out the door. There was also an additional starter and dessert not on the menu, as well a mini plate of fruit gelees, macarons, and a delicious little pink thing which may or may not have been a marshmallow to finish. A smoked salmon with panna cotta, caviar, and gold leaf on top - and a watermelon granita with lime foam as a refreshing palate cleanser. I absolutely loved the chestnut veloute - the flavors were so intriguing. If he could, I'm sure SO would have licked some of his plates clean.

Vegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Le Cirque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobster bisque was way way too salty.  The risotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall off the bone.  The halibut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that was soggy and not what was intended in terms of texture context between the flesh and the breading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of a souffle is to break it yourself and pour in the cream/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking.  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is supposed to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made out of ice, but the taste was too tart and didn't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative.

We thought everything was ""good"", but that was the extent of it.  We had the Escargot, Sea-Bass, Chicken and Creme Brulee.  Again, everything was ""good"", but we could not honestly recommend any of these items.  The 3 wine pairings with each meal were different per entree, but none were worth the equivalent of $16 per glass or however the breakdown worked out (3 glasses for $50).

2400253,2013-11-29,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Wow, what a disappointment.

My family and I went for Thanksgiving.  The menu was set at $145 for a set five courses meaning that each course was averaging $29.  

The first course was a lobster salad which was decent, but nothing to write home about.  

The second course was 1.5-2oz of parmesan risotto.  Also good, but nothing spectacular.  

Third course was sea bass wrapped in potato.  Inventive, but not only dry, but I was served an unacceptable piece of fish, certainly not one that should exist in a restaurant with this price structure.  

Fourth course, the supposed turkey which was an approximately 1.5""x1.5"" square.
When I cut into it there was a huge blood vessel running through the center.  Nice. They also forgot my drizzle of sweet potato.  Additional items including a solitary piece of asparagus that had been bisected, perhaps a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, and a rolled up item I was told was a combination of dark meat and stuffing that was an measured perhaps 3/4 of an ounce.  When I told the staff of the issue with the meat requesting a new plate with a normal sized portion of turkey, sweet potatoes and asparagus guess what I got?  The same tiny portions, but at least this time the turkey was edible.  

The only real stand out for this meal was the last course which was a chocolate dome with hazelnut praline and icecream inside.  Hot chocolate was poured over the top to melt into the top of the dome.  Inventive and delicious.  

This will definitely be marked as the one Thanksgiving I had where I wasn't stuffed.",T5MJ20E14ZnYqsZporHEQw,4,2,2,kDd2yjIUxRtgkuXdw0MCEg
2408799,2013-07-07,22,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Now, I rarely ever write mediocre 3 Star reviews, but in my honest opinion, my tepid experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. With that said, here's the rundown of what transpired on the evening of July 4th... After reading rave reviews from friends and fellow Yelpers, i decided to choose Le Cirque to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The restaurant was bustling when we arrived. We were seated towards the back which was upsetting since I requested a window seat months in advance. A few tables were still vacant by the window, which I found puzzling. Moments later those same seats were filled with other patrons, same number of guests mind you, that came after us. Not a good start so far. 

Granted the place was busy, it's no excuse for the waiter to make us feel rushed. He seemed hurried and not warm yet he was quite efficient at taking our orders and whisking away in a flash.  He clumsily scattered our silverware on the table like we were dining at Denny's. Wait, even at Denny's our utensils are placed with more care than this jumbled mess.

We all went with the degustation menu at 135$ per person and the birthday boy went with the 88$ additional wine pairing, as well. With a bottle of French Pinot Gris on the table, we were good to go.

The breads weren't warm, but room temperature and very chewy. 
I went with the onion bacon and pretzel. The pretzel was salty and too tough to eat and the onion bacon was hard and practically indelible. 

Thankfully, our amuse bouche was a refreshing bite sized cucumber wrapped creme fraiche treat that awakened my palate perfectly. 

The first course was incredible.  It was a delicate langoustine osetra caviar carpaccio with crisp sliced green apples that simply made my taste buds pop at first bite. The contrasting textures and flavors went from tart to tangy to sweet and spectacular. A splendid first course.

Here's where it gets bad, again. The time period between the first and second course went from lengthy to uncomfortably long. Luckily I was in good company and we had pleasant conversation that helped pass the time but the extensive wait (30 minutes) was inexcusable.
We inquired with our server and he quickly rushed into the kitchen without responding to us. Moments later, our dishes came out from one of the support staff that appeared agitated and rushed, as well. What was going on here? There was plenty of staff standing around, yet the same few guys were running frantically around the small restaurant. Strange. 

The scallops were supple, buttery and exhibited an excellent mouthfeel.

The foie gras was magnificent. The combination with the sweet plump cherries was genius.

The fresh black truffle risotto was a huge disappointment, however. The risotto was undercooked and hard, which is not the consistency a good risotto should feel like. The only saving grace were the finely sliced black truffles sprinkled on top, that left a subtle yet heavenly aroma to this mediocre dish. At an additional 40$ supplement to the 135$ per person tasting menu, I expected better. I would have sent it back but refrained in fear of an even longer and more excruciating wait time.

The third courses were far more redeeming with the beautifully crusted cod that tasted like butter in my mouth and the sea bass that was simply heavenly
The John Dory was good but paled in comparison to the complex flavor profiles of the other two mind blowing dishes. 

The fourth dishes were fantastic, too. Namely the Kobe. It was literally melt in your mouth delicious. It came at an additional 65$ premium but it was well worth it. Divine in every way!

The duck was supple and the flesh was smooth and velvety soft. 

The rabbit was tasty but I couldn't help but feel it tasted like chicken.

The pre-dessert was bright and whimsical. A tequila lime sorbet with fresh grapefruit and poprocks was inventive, surprising, refreshing and a perfect palate cleanser

In regards to dessert, don't skip it. You would be making a huge mistake. With that said, you've gotta try the soufflés here. They are perfect pillows of paradise in every bite. The chocolate was enticing but the vanilla grand marnier was irresistible! The ice sculpture berry sorbet dessert was inventive and incredibly refreshing, as well.

My friend received a birthday selection of mignardises and the ladies were presented with truffles neatly presented in Cartier inspired jewelry boxes. 

Thankfully the night ended on a positive note but in all honesty, for a restaurant of this caliber, I expected far more consistency in service than the inattentive and sloppy half-baked excuse for service we got last night. If it weren't for some of the incredibly amazing dishes, I would have given this place one star for the poor service alone.

If I were you, check out Picasso in the same hotel. They offer beautiful views, delicious five star quality dining coupled with exceptional service.

Happy Eats!",3vTf1xay9Oewde1BzakcQw,33,26,3,Wxl1ADwBhV704OT-1GEnNw

2435533,2016-08-25,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I have only given 5-star ratings to a very select few, but Le Cirque has deservedly earned the highest rating that I can give!  I simply cannot point to any one thing at Le Cirque that was not to my expectations and complete satisfaction. I wanted to celebrate a milestone birthday in Las Vegas and I chose Le Cirque after checking out all the upscale restaurants on the Strip. Their 3-course prix-fixe menu was special and unique for an early dinner before going to the theatre at 7:00P.

Their pre-theatre menu was absolutely incredible. First worth mentioning is the dining room which was absolutely gorgeous. The designer made the room both inviting and elegant.  We were seated in front of the windows so we could also enjoy the fountain water show that goes on in front of the Bellagio every 30 minutes. The food and presentation offered on their menu couldn't have been any better.  The amuse bouche of salmon tartare topped with creme fraiche and caviar with gold leaf was both beautiful and delicious.  If you love foie gras, their seared foie gras will knock your socks off.  Their wild salmon was prepared extremely well. The pastry wrapped sea bass simply melted in your mouth. Kudos to the chef!  And when you don't think you can eat another bite, petit fours are presented to cap off the entire meal and boxed chocolates to the ladies.  

The wait staff service was top-notch and always available and helpful.  The sommelier knows his wine and made excellent recommendations from their extensive wine list without having to dig deep into your pocketbook. I could go on and on about Le Cirque, but you will need to simply make your dinner reservations now to experience and appreciate exceptional food and service.  And best of all, they made my birthday extra special and memorable. Thank you Le Cirque at the Bellagio in Las Vegas!!!",g0NOf-1ytBMakQogD7ps7g,2,0,5,uPKUJxykdvdgUJ1OsM0M3g
2454810,2009-06-16,6,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Since the food in Vegas is marked up a gazillion percent, we decided that one nice meal out was all we could afford while in town. Le Cirque in the Bellagio was a wise choice. It was a perfect blend of fine dining and fun. 

I started with the lobster salad which was phe-nom. We were told that people come here from all over JUST for this salad and I could see why. The beef tip that I ordered was good but a little dry... I had mistakenly approved medium well thinking that he had said medium, so that was probably more my fault than anything else. The best part of the meal was the dessert. I am a chocolate lava cake connoisseur and I have to say that the one I had here was the best I've had yet, even surpassing Shadowbrook's in Capitola (which is very hard to do)! 

I will also note that I tried my friends truffle risotto, wow....if I had to do it over again I might have passed up the lobster salad and gone for this dish. It seemed almost impossible for something to taste so damn good. 

The decor is festive and fun with a colorful circus theme. The service was impeccable and well timed the way it should be. My only complaint was that the server pulled out all the stops to sell this seasonal champagne cocktail that didn't do much for me; it tasted like any other effervescent drink and since he raved about it I expected greatness. 

If you're in Vegas and have some money to spend on a nice dinner, this is a great choice.",zDltf7SGyDANcA6ndZkF7A,8,8,4,7JftKvuFCbQPEMXvCS62IA
2477266,2013-07-18,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Came here because of the good reviews and let me just say I was not disappointed. The servers were great, always attending to your every needs. Constantly refilling water, giving you bread. They asked a million times if we had shows or other time constraints, so they do everything possible to maximize your experience. 

The place is kind of small so the tables are close. It was close enough to see what the people next to you were eating but not close enough to hear their conversation clearly. The place is quiet so its great for a romantic dinner. It is located next the bellagio fountains and everything the show started I could hear the pumps go off. Ask for a window seat for the fountain view.

On to the food and wine. I had the tasting menu with the wine paring. I got to say, everything was excellent. Everything from the presentation of the food to the taste and wine was just perfect. The food that stood out the most to me was the foie gras. The flavor and texture was so good and unique that i could still taste it in my mouth now. Other things worth mentioning that I tried are the sea bass and the dessert I got (it was a chocolate ball). 

If you have the time and money, you must try this place! The experience was one of a kind. I will definitely come again and recommend this place to anyone looking for fine dining. You will not be disappointed. Service and food is first class.",q2ZBlGmHOce7izBS3AdqIA,7,6,5,IAQT83fmXPAaKkf29GDoEg

However, it does not justify the dinner being almost $100 before tax and tip.

The service was satisfactory like their main dishes.

2581185,2011-01-06,4,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque is situated in Bellagio with an excellent view of the famous water fountain.  The restaurant is small, but every aspect of it makes it high class and sophisticated.  Even the servers wear suits and wait on you hand and foot.  When I got up in the middle of the meal, someone automatically directed me towards the restroom without having me ask.  Walking in the restaurant gives you a circus feel.  The colorful fabric on the walls and circus murals create a fun and entertaining ambiance.  The cute monkey plates they give you added a nice touch as well. 

So many starter breads to start out with.  Le Cirque never leaves out the details.  Even the butter had a cute design with ""Le Cirque"" stamped on it.  We opted for the 3 course meal.  They start you off with an amuse bouche which consisted of a puffed cheese pastry and some creamy soup.  The pastry was fluffy and buttery.  The soup which tasted like some sort of chowder was a great start to the meal.  

For the appetizer, we had the lobster salad and foie gras au torchon.  The lobster salad consisted of a fresh whole lobster tail with house dressing.  The small citric taste of the dressing helped to balance the refreshing greens of the dish.  The foie gras was not the greatest I've had.  It had a stronger taste which didn't balance well with the sweetness of the strawberry compote.  It wasn't as smooth and creamy as some other foie gras I've had.

We had a blanquette de lapin (rabbit) and chilean sea bass for the main course.  Both came highly recommended by the staff.  The rabbit was tender and full of flavor.  The presentation was unique.  The foamed sauce surrounded the rabbit and ravioli.  The sea bass was the best part of the meal.  The best way to describe it was AMAZING!!.  The meat was flaky, but not too bouncy.  Each of the threads of the fish could be separated as it melted in my mouth.  It was accompanied by two citric vinaigrette reductions: orange and lemon, which added a sweet and tangy taste to the fish.  This is a definite must-try for any fish or simply food lover without a deathly allergy reaction to fish.

The meal ended on a sweet sensation.  We had a chocolate sphere and chocolate soufflé.  The sphere reminded me of a giant Rocher chocolate .  It comes with a warm chocolate that was poured over the sphere and opened it revealing the rich milk chocolate in the center.  It was a great show. There was even an edible gold foil on top.  This dessert was just chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate!  Great for the chocolate lover like myself.  The warm cream poured on the soufflé created a nice contrast to the cold vanilla bean ice cream.  Another must for the chocolate lover.  The portions at first seemed small, but with the added bonuses, I was really full at the end.

After a delectable meal, go see the awesome Cirque du Soleil show: O, which is just next door.  Come here to get a taste of high class Vegas!  This restaurant which with a Michelin star is rightfully earned.",JCapJcvST-rREaLEvNRMcQ,5,4,5,5o3llkkFZ5_WrC7lL_9Utw

The two desserts, the chocolate souffle and a raspberry dish, were both delicious.

Le Cirque is a beautiful dining room overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Our table was next to the window so we had a great view. 
The service is incredible and friendly, but the food, I've had better. 

On the menu you will definintely find decadent choices with both appetizers and entrees. They also have an excellent wine list. 
After a few questions about the menu we ordered.

Our appetizers arrived. I had the crab salad, which was a lite salad topped with hearts of palm, caviar and spinkled with pomegranate seeds. Nice and fresh tasting. One of the ladies in my party had the fois gras which she said was very good, another - escargot which she said was good. However 2 of us got the lobster and avocado salad, which the lobster was so tough it was hard to cut. 
When we mentioned it to our server, two men came back to our table, one remarked it must be our knife. (Really? not the response I expected) Uh.. no it's tough.. Since this is what I ordered for my entree, I asked if I could change my order to the Hamachi, they said no problem. 

Our entrees came, two of the ladies did enjoy their sea bass and black bass. However the sea bass presentation could have been better, It was wrapped in potato with a brown sauce.. (brown & white only on a plate, not too appetizing)
Another ordered venison, which she said was good, and another had the lobster risotto which she said was great.  The himachi I had was good, it sait on two pieces of avocado which were topped with rock salt, which was a bit much. Again it had heart of palm which was great. 

They do say save the best for last and it was with dessert. I didn't order anything but 3 of the women got the chocolate ball, which I tasted. Rich dark chocolate poured over 3 to 4 different decadant chocolates. Beautiful presentation. 

Again, the atmosphere nice, the service great, but the food?? For the price, I expected it to be one of the best meals I've ever had. With melt in your mouth food.  Unfortunately, I've had better.",Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,3,0,3,1fcZP_JVYnr7n4yp_mJPLA
2672422,2011-08-04,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"We LOVED our dinner at Le Cirque. The atmosphere is quiet and intimate. The decor, with draped canopy on the ceiling, feels romantic. The chairs are comfy. Our server was so attentive he made me nervous (haha). We opted for the pre-theatre menu without wine pairing (although I wish I had). Everything was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

Complementary:
One-bite Lobster Cake with Tomato Soup/Sauce - The lobster cake was good, although with just one bite, ""good"" is the only word I can describe it with. The tomato soup/sauce was a little too sour.

Bread & Butter - We both had the rosemary bread and loved it. It was fresh and still hot, there are bacon and some other stuff in there so the bread had flavor as is, but even better with the butter.

Appetizer:
Risotto du Marché - Mushroom Risotto. It was delicious, very flavorful, creamy but still with some bite. The nuts in there (macadamia I think?) made the dish more interesting.

Bisque de Homard - I had a couple bites of this from my boyfriend's plate, the soup was smooth and creamy and very flavorful, although boyfriend said it gets salty half way through.

Main Course:
Dos de Saumon Ecossais - The salmon was done to perfection, with the center still tender, but a bit too salty for my taste. I LOVED the parmesan gnocchi on the side, I got sad as they disappear on my plate.

Coeur de Filet de Boeuf - The steak too, was done to perfection (boyfriend asked for medium rare). I didn't have any of the side one-bites, but I did had a bite of the steak, and it was so so flavorful.

Dessert:
We were served three things: Chocolate Sphere with Praline Mousse, White Chocolate Ice Cream, and Hazelnut Caramel Crunch for me, Young Coconut with Passion Fruit Mousse, Pineapple Compote, and Mango Sorbet for my boyfriend, and a platter of five two-bites for the both of us.

Watching the Chocolate Sphere melt open as they pour hot chocolate sauce on it was as good as eating the sphere itself. The Coconut dessert was so good I stole it from my boyfriend and gave him my sphere. It was foamy on the surface, the sorbet was tangy, and there are real fruits in there.

At the end, we were given a cute little drawer with two chocolates inside to take home. I anticipated trying this place out and we were both glad that we did.",EhBSpcrb_td3l8TjqdiQDA,3,2,5,bguBQ7a-72Xwz70Ighk0aw

What made this place extra special was the friendly and very helpful wait staff.  The sommelier was full of stories about the wine and about life....our waiter (the redhead!) gave his honest opinion and critique about the food....his main concern was our dining experience, not getting us to order the most expensive thing.  (What a concept!)

But....if you're the type that doesn't want to talk to the wait staff and just wants to concentrate on the meal....you won't be disappointed!  Each dish was full of intricate favors, and was beautifully presented.  I ordered the wine pairing which made it even better!

I definitely would recommend this place, and want to return soon!",JpQi2cpUTArMCe0VPRwbZA,0,0,5,ni0-EUUcZJf0DU86xyqWGA

Came here before a show and was surprised to hear they have a theater prefixe menu and they are able to get the courses out quickly. I'm use to spending 3+ hours at fancy restaurants so this sounded awesome to me.

Great restaurants have impeccable service and Le cirque did not disappoint. Witty waiters, and attentive busboys were everywhere. I think we got serviced by 4 different people. 

The timing of the courses was excellent. No awkward long waits between each finished course. The kitchen was nice enough to substitute one of the prefixe entree choices with the rabbit.

Presentation and flavors of the foods were on point. Delicious Lobster and corn bisque. I can go on about the food but I'm sure other reviewers can say it better than me. In the meantime, enjoy my pictures.",WcxbtSZlF4DT41TIaz0Itg,2,2,5,j-X4VMm2Yto8DULMWyXqRA
2773720,2011-04-11,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"My fiancee and I had the pleasure of eating here for my 29th birthday tonight.  I have always wanted to eat at a Michelin star restaurant, and after reading about other restaurants in Vegas on Yelp, we chose to celebrate at Le Cirque.

We arrived 15 minutes early, and were quickly seated at our table overlooking the Bellagio Water Show.  The dining room was impeccably decorated with a playful circus decor.  Having already perused the menu online before traveling to Vegas, we knew what we wanted to order.  I chose the Degustation Menu (5-course), my fiancee went with the Pre Fixe (3-course), and we both had wine pairings.

Our meal started with an amuse-bouche: a turnip soup for her, and an oyster for myself.  This was followed by a lobster salad, and foie gras terrine for my fiancee.  Both were amazing.  The foie gras terrine was the most beautifully plated dish of the night, accompanied with a date, fruit gelee, fig jam, and a raisin brioche.  My next dish was the sauteed foie gras atop white chocolate brioche, roasted pear, and a butterscotch caramel.  It was the most amazing dish of the night - melted in your mouth like butter, just like good foie gras should.  The wine pairing was a sweet wine that accompanied the caramel/raisin very well.  This was the first time my fiancee had foie gras, and she is definitely now a fan.

My next course was sea bass with a pinot noir reduction (paired with a glass of the same pinot), and was delicious.  Our entrees came out at the same time, which was honey-glazed duck breast and duck confit for me, and the Homard Retour d'Asie for her.  The Homard was composed of Maine Lobster tail and claws, King Crab ravioli, with pureed asparagus.  Yum.

A pre-desert course consisted of a raspberry gelee with pop rocks - a nice palate cleanser.  My fiancee asked for the chocolate sphere, and I was not offered a choice.  When the deserts arrived, she got a chocolate souffle instead, and I had some sort of raspberry sorbet.  We didn't feel the need to complain about the mistake, and were not disappointed with the change - the souffle was awesome.  In addition, they brought by a tray of petit fours which were also very good.

The overall atmosphere was inviting, with a playful circus theme and great views of the Bellagio Fountain show.  The food was top notch and there was no surprise that the restaurant is a 5-diamond AAA and Michelin star recipient.  The food was easily some of the best food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.  Being from Miami, we are used to pretty lousy service, so it doesn't take much to impress us in that regard. The sommelier was very knowledgable and provided us with great parings.  There was more than ample wait staff  - it looked like there were sometimes 2 or 3 per table.  The only downside of the entire AMAZING night was the minor mistake with the dessert.  I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Vegas with a sophisticated palate and a few extra dollars - well worth it!",FuQKrM_1CyQrEHegFCnc3g,4,4,5,FnRYEKOazNUyAPY6AEawvQ

We where taken in at exactly our reservation time and greeted promptly and warmly by our waiters. The bread was so warm and good. Some of the bread they have here is also available at the belagio buffet which I had the next morning! Every dish is prepared with beautiful presentation and looks like it should be framed.

For starters I had the foie gras which was the best foie gras I have had. It was horribly unfortunate my date didn't want any and had to eat it all myself.

For the entree I had what they called a Rabbit Melody, and a melody it was. It was multiple rabbit preparations on top of each other, including rabbit ravioli, surrounded by spätzle and some amazing sauces.

They have a fabulous wine and desert menu in which I encourage you to try their armagnacs. There simply the best here I have ever had.

I had the five course meal with my boyfriend and we loved the fine dining experience!

They serve fresh bread in various assorments: french, bacon and cheddar, chocolate coffee, rosemary, and pretzel. 

First course I had the pea soup which was very tasty and had beautiful presentation. My boyfriend had the yellowtail sashimi and it had a very bold, citrus flavor that he loved. 

Second course was foie gras which was tender and creative use of apples and caramel sauce. 

Third course I had sea bass which was so tender and juicy. The wine sauce was amazing and my boyfriend had a scallop which was tender, delicious, and well balanced. 

Fourth course I had lamb which was absolutely AMAZING. It was a perfect medium and it was juicy and full of amazing flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken and he thought it was well marinated and he loved the gravy. 

The last course was dessert which I had Crème brûlée. It was the best I've ever had. The tart was perfect and creamy. My boyfriend had a chocolate ball with ice cream inside and the chocolate ball melted as they poured chocolate over it. Also, they give four small french desserts (macaroons, etc) in a very creative dish filled with brown sugar. 

We were also given a small tasting of salmon from the chef, and a souvenir box with bon bons inside. One of my favorite parts was the palatte cleanser. It was a nonalcoholic sangria inside of a bon bon or something and it just pops in your mouth and cleans it all out! It was a lot of fun, and it was an amazing dining experience. 

I would highly recommend coming to this restaurant and I hope that I can come here again soon.",Qbm-Oh2uk4_w6wSQl4Docw,3,0,5,3dHqMaY9LSWBOCpkLUkBTg
2807792,2017-04-05,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I've never bothered to review Le Cirque before because, hey, it's Le Cirque.  OF COURSE it's five stars.  You need me to tell you that?  It's one of the finest restaurants in the world.  And, unlike some famous New York restaurants, the Las Vegas outpost of Le Cirque is not just a namesake.  It is simply fantastic.

I have recently found myself compelled to give less than stellar ratings to a couple of other Bellagio restaurants.  So, in the interest of fairness, I wanted to say something nice about a Bellagio dining experience.  Yelp defines five stars as ""Woohoo!  As good as gets!""  Le Cirque is that.

If I had to quibble about something (and believe me, that's not easy here) I would mention that I might like a menu that is less ""bundled.""  I'm not a big dessert fan, so I would be happy with a menu that allowed more of an a la carte selection, and didn't require me to order a multi-course meal with dessert.  But, you know, if I have to choke down a Crème Brûlée or a  Soufflé - well, as they say, c'es la vie.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,0VnkmNa1INkmO23qj8iT7Q

Little did they know that 2 people including myself spoke French so we became louder and stayed WAY beyond our welcome.

2826508,2013-07-15,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"One of my top dining experiences to date! The level of service from the moment we walked in the door until we departed was exceptional. Warm, friendly, incredibly attentive without being intrusive. The décor and ambiance were both classy and whimsical without being pretentious. I ordered the lobster risotto starter and my friend had the pâté...both dishes were absolutely exquisite, both in flavor and presentation. For our entrees, we each ordered the potato crusted sea bass, which is one of their specialties (in fact, it was the video on their website of this dish that convinced me to make reservations!) and it did not disappoint. The potato was perfectly browned and lightly crispy, while the fish was tender and moist. The wine reduction was so delicious...truly one of those sauces that you hate to leave even a drop on the plate at the end of the meal. For dessert, we decided to double souffle it, ordering both the banana and chocolate. Perfectly airy, not too sweet, incredibly decadent without being heavy...paired with our cup of espresso, it was a delightful end to a glorious meal! 

We had show tickets for that evening, and the staff timed our meal perfectly, without ever making us feel rushed. One of our servers even stopped by to make sure we knew the quickest route to the show. Absolutely top notch service from beginning to end and a party for the taste buds for every single course. The 3-course meal was under $100/person excluding beverages, tax and gratuity, which I thought was more than reasonable. The portion sizes were perfect (and I like to eat!), we left full, but not painfully so, and stayed that way the rest of the evening. This is now on my list of 'must eats' for Vegas and I can't wait to return!

2863244,2012-04-01,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I don't know where to start!!! I originally planned to get a reservation at Picasso, but they didn't have any open slots left for Friday night, so that's how we ended up at Le Cirque. I like the whole circus concept of the restaurant - classy and unique. 
This was my first fine-dining experience - decided to do it for my 21st birthday and left feeling very satisfied.

3 of us decided to go for the Degustation (tasting) menu for $135 and the other 2 ordered a la carte for $98. Oh! I learnt something new - the waiter asked if I would like a black napkin, I just went along with him and said yes but then thought, why do I get a black napkin?Maybe it's because I'm special? since he didn't offer the others black napkins, but then I googled it and realized it was because I wore a black dress and white napkins could leave lint residue on my dress. haha okay back to the food.
We ordered quite a variety of dishes, so I got to try a lot that night. Everything was delicieux, so here are some of my favorites:
- endive and scallop salad - the scallop was so perfectly cooked and sweet
- truffle risotto (extra $40 - it's worth it): didn't know what truffle really tastes like, so I decided to get it and it was very creamy, earthy and truffle-y (don't know how else to describe it)
- if you don't want to spend the extra $40 but want something that's worth that extra $40, get the Santa Barbara Sea Urchin - it's to die for. Warm and mixed with king crab and lemongrass 
- Mediterranean sea bass - after having eaten the creamy risotto, I decided to go for something lighter and I'm glad I went with our server's recommendation (the Pinot Noir sauce is to die for - I'd take a shot of it over grey goose any day)
- honey glazed duck - tres tres bien
- got the cheese instead of the pre-dessert sorbet: they carved the cheese into a flower and served it with bread
We each ordered their raspberry champagne to go with the food - champagne was light and you can't really taste the alcohol - perfect for someone like me who isn't a fan of any types of alcohol.

The best part for me was the dessert. It was amazing - creativity level 8
- petite boule de chocolat: it's a pretty big ball of chocolate, on which they pour hot chocolate. Once the chocolate sphere melts, you'll find praline, white chocolate ice cream and hazelnut caramel crunch inside
If you love chocolate, this is what you should order - I think I died for a bit watching the chocolate sphere melt.

You know how they say it's the company, not the food that makes a dining experience great? I think this is a place where you can go eat alone and still have a great time. Our main server is very amicable and il est francais - got to practice a bit of my french haha 
At the end of our meal, the server brought us a plate of petite desserts and the ladies get a small box of chocolates. What a perfect start to a great night!",nAoR_O35MnVotyH5L4-3qQ,1,0,5,8dUfpYuok2RyvqNTPpuHlw

2886890,2011-09-21,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"My first Le Cirque experience was ephipanal. Between the service, decor and the food, I couldn't have been more beside myself. So, when out of town friends suggested we treat ourselves to dinner, I was only too ready to hit this baby up again. 

Sadly, I was disappointed the second time. I decided on the $98 three-course standard (a pretty good deal for an app, entree and dessert at a Michelin star resto). The amuse that started the meal was heavenly....a shot of organic tomato soup and a little crab cake. Delish. The uni risotto, however, left much to be desired. The risotto itself was more than al dente... it wasn't really cooked. The uni sauce in which the risotto sat was incredibly heavy... so heavy, in fact, that it was congealing on the plate. Yuck.  The scallops served atop the risotto were great.. I only wish there were more on the plate. After the risotto, my expectations for the main course were low. Thankfully, the sea bass wrapped in a thin potato skin was great, though the fish was slightly overcooked. Because we were a large group, the 10 of us split a fantasy dessert -- every dessert on the menu. While most of the desserts were ok, the stand out was the grand marnier souffle (the yuzu/passion fruit dessert, however, was a major miss). 

But here's the real rub: at some point during the meal, one of the waiter dropped a dollop of a buttery, cream sauce on the back of my husband's silk shirt. When I asked one of the waiters to help with getting club soda, he looked at me like I had two heads! After discussing the matter with the restaurant manager, he graciously adjusted the check by $50. That said, rookie mistakes at this type of resto are really inexcusable. 

The star of the show was the fantastic sommalier: Frank. If you're lucky enough to be dining when he's working, ask him to share his thoughts about Vegas with you. He is absolutely fantastic.",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,1,0,3,GFng7dGF8gqR1ezYHKKgtw

Multiple menus are available here, but we all partook from the prix-fixe menu.  That evening's amuse bouche was a perfect way to get things rolling.  The appetizer of sauteed foie gras had a perfect flavor and texture, and the rabbit symphony brought things together in a perfect harmony.  And what evening would not be complete without dessert -- mascarpone and chestnut mousse with huckleberry compote and white coffee ice cream.

He asks me about fried chicken and being a female of color, I didn't notice it until after he left that he asks about fried chicken from all the foods in the world. When told I was Latina, he got quiet and walked away. Later on, we heard him making comments about another patron in the main room about his breath being bad and that a mint couldn't help or save him. We were shocked at his behavior and words that were not whispered to his fellow co-worker who remained quiet and continued providing excellent service to the patrons.

2958026,2012-10-15,6,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"So what if Pete Wells demoted the New York original down to one star? Maybe it deserved it. And so what if the Las Vegas outpost has been open for more than a decade? One thing is for sure, this place does not clown around when it comes to fine dining. In what is perhaps one of my best food experiences in this town, Le Cirque combines the elegance and refinement of the Big Apple with the seductive theatricality of Sin City.

We opted for the Dégustation Menu with Premium Pairing. At $135 and $88 respectively, the meal is pricier than Picasso but certainly not as much as Guy Savoy or Jöel Robuchon. With tax and tip, expect to pay around $275 per person.

Dinner started with a cold amuse of New Zealand mussel with Catalan sauce and corn chowder. I typically do not like mussels because I find them too rubbery, but I have to say this was delicious. The sweetness of the corn paired nicely with the peppery tomato sauce.

For my first course I had the Santa Barbara sea urchin. Beautifully served in a ceramic sea urchin, which actually kind of looked like a candle votive (ha!), the urchin was transformed into an ""ice cream"" of sorts and then folded into a fennel purée and a ginger-lemongrass gelée. It was an extraordinary dish, one that presented my palate with flavors I have never tasted before. Paired with a NV Ruinart blanc de blanc, it was epiphanic!

The next course was sautéed Sonoma foie gras, served on a white chocolate and raisin brioche, with a honey glazed apricot, almond and cardamom tarte to the side. It's hard not to enjoy foie gras, especially one prepared as well as this one, but after the sea urchin, I felt I had tasted these flavors before, so I was not as impressed. This was paired with a 1929 Maury Pla del Fount.

The third course was my absolute favorite of the evening. It was a chorizo crusted Alaskan black cod, accompanied by a garlic brandade, piperade basque on the side, and squid ink sauce. Now this is why you come to Le Cirque! The sheer brilliance of this dish is that nearly every component was doubled -- the cod was doubled in the filet and brandade, the chorizo was both on top and inside the filet, and squid ink was used as a sauce and the dye for the brandade. Paired with a beautiful but ripe 2009 Patrice Rion Nuits Saint George, it stands as one of the top three fish dishes I have had in my life!

Our next course was a fascinating dish, one that required two days to make: bucatini timbale, Kobe beef oxtail, Périgord truffles, with daube sauce. When it arrived at the table, it looked like a little beehive, but it was actually a perfectly-lined up spiral of bucatini. It is only when I cut into the ""beehive"" that I saw the oxtail ragu inside. Simply amazing! I was buzzing with glee! And although I enjoyed the 2005 Chateau Rouget on its own, the sweetness of the meat and sauce made the wine taste bitter.

For my dessert I ordered the chocolate sphere, which housed a flurry of praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, and hazelnut caramel crunch, all bathed in chocolate sauce. It was more visually appealing than anything else, but I still enjoyed it. Unfortunately, this last dish was disastrously paired with a 2005 Le Tertre du Lys d'Or Sauternes. The sommelier should have known better than to pair chocolate with Sauternes; Port or Madeira should have been the obvious choice.

But the sheer deliciousness of our entire meal compelled me to overlook this blunder. The food was exquisite, the service was on point, and my experience at Le Cirque was simply outstanding!",cWVsDzn7L7dwL9c5tubwaQ,14,7,5,QsexLjEl1nqlINj3bf7bCw

From the moment we stepped in, the service was impeccable. We were seated with a nice card acknowledging our anniversary. Our waiter also congratulated us as well and treated us so kindly throughout the night, giving us some extras. The first extra that came out was an amazing carrot concoction nestled inside an eggshell. I could have eaten 10 of those. 

The chocolate coffee bread that everyone has written about is truly amazing. It's one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life (and that's saying a lot). Our waiter not only brought me over extra slices of that chocolate coffee bread but he also wrapped up a few slices and slipped them into a to-go box for me to eat later. I could have married that man!

For our meals, everything was excellent. I started with the Hamachi which tasted so fresh and had a nice yuzu complement. My partner had the lobster and avocado which was also delicious with generous pieces of lobster. For mains, he got the symphony of rabbit and I got the potato wrapped sea bass. That sea bass had the most rich, flavourful sauce. Perfection.  For dessert, he had cheesecake (with a Degas painting printed on top!) and I had the infamous chocolate ball. For chocolate lovers, this was the way to go. Just when you think you're done, we got a tray with macaroni and a little box with chocolate truffles. The waiter also gave us a signed menu from the chef which was a thoughtful souvenir. 

I loved every part of our meal, and I didn't want it to end. I could easily imagine coming here again and splurging on the 10 course meal. Maybe for our next anniversary!",Mz-WUZj-AkXsr_kOUE-71A,0,0,5,ID4YUozswAiDImXZj0QQQw

But mostly I leave here more enamores because of the service that one receives when they come to Las Vegas Le Cirque.
It must be mentioned that all or at least most of the waitstaff are originally foundational stuff meaning they been there for some 20 years.
It is professional,  a career and carried out with such aplomb and such attention to detail  towards making the evening a delightfully pleasant one, though not pretentious by any means.
Our servers that evening were Tom and Javier and course there are visits to the table by other dignitaries who offer amuse bouche and other delights courtesy of the chef along with your 3,5 or 10 course delight.
I will not go into detail of the amazing libations and delightful morsels to experience here, suffice it to say it is a spectacle to behold.

When we spend over $700 for a fancy French dinner, there is an expectation of extraordinary service. However, altogether they were INCOMPETENT, and as a result, WE WERE LATE FOR OUR SHOW and MISSED THE BEGINNING. We arrived when they opened at 5:30PM, and we were asked at least twice whether we were seeing a show. We had tickets for the 7:30PM show located in the same hotel, and they were aware of this from the beginning. When we were seated we were offered the regular menu, and we had to ask for the pre - theater menu, which made us believe that we could order off of either menu. Some of us ordered from the pre - theater menu, and others ordered off the regular menu. Our main course arrived at around 7PM, and it could have tasted good if we had time to taste it. Instead, we had to eat quickly, so that we could make it to our show on time. We got up to ask for our check at 7:15PM. We thought about getting our desserts boxed to go, but we naively believed that dessert would come shortly. One of the wait staff wished us to enjoy the show, but we had not even received dessert yet. At around 7:25PM, we were stuffing dessert down, and then we rushed to the show. However, we were late and missed the beginning of our show because of their incompetence and lack of care. They should not offer a pre - theater menu if they cannot serve a 3-course meal in a timely fashion. Vegas shows have regular start times, and they should know better. There is no good excuse! This was a special occasion, and it was ruined. Some of the wait staff were friendly, but others snubbed us, probably because we didn't order alcohol or because we were Asian. They didn't even apologize for their slow service and underplayed how late it was, and their lack of acknowledgement of the situation is disrespectful.

3100774,2011-05-11,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"For openers, perhaps one of the finest dining experience I have ever experienced.  Too often heavily starred restaurants have let me down.  Not because of any particular failure, but because the hype was just a little too much.  Stephanie Izzard's GNG comes to mind.  Being the flagship restaurant at the Bellagio, I did expect a ""wow factor"" but I have been let down on The Strip before.  Vegas teems with overachievers trying to do it bigger and better than the original.  Well, bigger and brighter is not always better.  Places like Daniel, Emeril, and Per Se cannot be improved upon.  Le Cirque did not try to dazzle, rather, it just succeeded in providing an elegant, warm, and earnest dining experience.  We all had the degustation menu.  My personal favorite was the sauteed foie over white chocolate and raisin brioche garnished with candied blackberries, asian pear & caramel (definitely a must for my ""death row"" meal).  My least favorite was the sea bass.  It was ""nice"" but a bit boring next to the rest of the menu.  I added escargot to the degustation menu and they were superb.  The deserts were fabulous and generous.  During our pre-desert, we encountered a strange deja-vu -- only to learn that the sweet rhubarb and ginger ice cream had been infused with strawberry Pop Rocks!  A nice whimsy touch to an otherwise serious menu.  I cannot wait to get back to Vegas and Le Cirque.  To date, my best meal in Vegas, bar none.",ENc7dUAAqtLc23ALSt4yng,0,0,5,J6r7zGeCdJwI3XRyfQcdxA

There was someone constantly waiting on us, whether it be filling our wine or adding more bread to the table or talking to us. The decor is simply marvelous. It is a fine dining place but not uptight and snobbish. They have a full bar too in case you have a long wait. It is inside Bellagio and they promptly ask you if you need to be somewhere (e.g. Shows) later. Accordingly they take orders all together etc. 
The amuse bouche was salmon tartare on something I don't remember but it was delectable. We chose a Napa Chardonnay and loved it :) 
For appetizers we had the avocado and lobster salad, burgundy snails (that were de-shelled), and the yellowtail. Everything was perfect. What I mean when I say perfect is that no flavor was overpowering but it was the right amount! 
Three of us took the Colorado lamb that was perfectly made medium rare. The meat was juicy and tender and went beautifully with the lamb jus and buttered vegetables. One of us took the fish (did not get to try, she devoured it and said it was too good to share). 
Before we could order dessert our waiter told us he ordered one of each kind from their pastry chef as compliments of the restaurant. The crème brûlée was classic and the sugar level was just right. The melting chocolate ball was done perfectly too. The raspberry yogurt something and other stuff was good too. I should have written them all done.

The most attentive staff, delicious food, elegant and upscale decor.  My husband and I were quite impressed and would definitely go back for another go at some point in the future.

The meal started off with this delicious amuse bouche - a chilled corn chowder.  I didn't think I'd want to eat a cold soup, but this was divine.  First course was my absolute favorite.  Chose the seasonal risotto, which currently it was topped with shaved white truffle.  HEAVENLY.  The risotto was perfectly creamy, the truffle decadent and rich.  I wanted to eat it all, but knew I had more food coming and most definitely didn't want to get too full too fast.  Sadly I had to give them a 2/3 empty bowl back, and my heart literally broke.

My husband loooooooves foie gras, so I knew before he opened his mouth he was about to order the seared foie gras.  All he kept saying throughout the course was this was how foie gras was supposed to taste.  I'm pretty sure that meant he approved.

Second course was the Maine Lobster.  This came in the form of lobster tail, lobster cake and a couple of lobster claws.  Accompanied by a mushroom and squash side.  I didn't eat much of the side - not because it wasn't good but because it didn't excite me like the lobster did.  You know, saving room and all that.  The lobster cake was like a crab cake and was very savory.  I did like the tail, but I wasn't over the moon with it like I was the risotto.  But let's face it: how hard is it to top a 5-star risotto?  Very.

Hubby got the wagyu beef with bone marrow fondant.  We didn't talk much during this course.  He cleaned his plate.  That's enough evidence for me.

Last course was the roasted pineapple/white chocolate mousse/mango sorbet thing.  It was the perfect ending.  Not too rich - the tart sweetness of the pineapple balanced out the creamy mousse.  An excellent blend of flavors.  My husband had the chocolate Grand Marnier souffle, which he thought was spectacular.

Surprisingly, I didn't make myself miserable with food and walked away regretful that someone in the kitchen was in possession of the rest of my risotto.  Ah well.  It was definitely a meal to remember, that's for sure.",5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ,4,2,4,YZhUbgVbylllH-E5jwZnqg

3181672,2007-09-08,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I went to Le Cirque with insane expectations.  Being only my second dinner at the Bellagio, the previous one at the amazing Picasso, I had anticipated this dinner quite a bit.  In the end, I was disappointed.

We went in a party of 7.  When we sat down, menus were provided, but we knew immediately we were doing the tasting menu.  We raised some special needs with our waiter, and he provided several possible substitutions for certain dishes that did not fit the constraints.   He suggested a truffle rosotto over the scallop and mushroom.  Instead of john dory, how about rabbit, or chicken (really?), or filet?  

With the menu decided, bread was served.  The bread was excellent.  There were three or four different breads in each basket.  The highlight was something I've never seen before: fat, soft pretzel bread.  It was like having a soft pretzel in bread form.  It was great.

The first course was a lobster salad, but I don't eat shellfish.  Instead, I was given a nicely presented traditional salad.  It was okay.  Nothing very exciting, though the tomatoes were excellent.

The second course was a sauteed foie gras with dried fruits and hazelnut.  A classic combination, again, tried but true. This was excellent, though I think I've had enough foie gras for a couple years from this one dish alone -- it was not lacking in quantity.  

The next course was the risotto.  Again, the menu called for a scallop and mushroom, but I opted for a truffle risotto.  Boy, did it have truffles.  The entire mini sauce pan in which it was served was covered with large flakes of truffle.  I've never seen that much in one place.  The risotto was good.  The truffle tasted like nothing.  Yes, there was enough truffle to take many bites of just truffle.  I simply didn't understand it.  I suppose truffle is best appreciated through the nose. Other members of my party who ordered the scallop rosotto preferred theirs over the one with truffle. 

The next dish was the jon dorry.  It was fine.  Interestingly, it was served with a red wine sauce, which I do need to give the chef props for.  That was unique to my experience.

Then, the lamb.  I am having a hard time remembering it, again.  The waiter did not ask for our temperature preference, and as such everyone's came our medium/medium well.  That alone was not so impressive.  I do recall that it was the cleanest frenching I've ever seen on a chop, though.

With all the courses over, our waiter asked us if we'd like dessert.  We say yes, order some coffees, and by the time the coffee is served, the waiters all come out with 7 different desserts prepared, one for each person (a surprise!).  We played a game of Pass the Dessert and got to try them all.  Each was quite large.  The best was probably a coconut/mango ice cream served in a coconut.  Other offerings included two souffles, a strawberry shortcake, and others.  On top, we were provided petit fours.  Again, nothing truly amazing.

In all, I found the food pretty generic.  It was solid, no doubt, but not creative.  Nothing elicited a ""wow"" except, perhaps, some of the portions.  I feel like the kitchen was playing it safe with this menu.

I must compare this restaurant to Picasso.  The experience pales in comparison.  Add on top of that that the menu is $145 per person ($40-$50 more than Picasso) and then another $14 per person for the truffle substitution (and for what, exactly?), and one wonders what the value proposition here is.  

Perhaps my anticipation got the better of me, but in all, I can't fully recommend this restaurant.  I think there are better choices out there.",iWF93IYQAKPLKXPojtgEpw,3,0,4,TzwmH3AzlGAZa8lSt1wGlg

Sea Bass and Beef Tornado(Filet Mignon) with sauteed fois gras this time cooked just right....sauces with both were perfect
Breads were unlike any we've had
Forgot.... meal began with marinated cherries  served in lemon zest rose water...tasty

Dessert-chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream and creme fresh and creme broulee .... both were spectacular
meal ended with selection of petit fours that  were consistent with fine dining we had come to expect that evening

What can I say a memorable evening in every respect....Le Cirque is Le Best!!!!",Uu8Qzw0jsc4n4WxfaxWLrw,2,0,5,HrpDHJuCU6bSON0v8NYhRQ

Fast forward 2018, my wife and I now live in Las Vegas. We decided to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary at Le Cirque. I called and the staff is always the nicest and most accommodating. There are only 3 restaurants in all of Las Vegas with service like this. 

I told them I wanted to eat the secret menu Surf and Turf that I had read about in magazines. With 1 months notice they were more than happy to accommodate. 
That night the service was amazing, the food was fantastic and the way we were treated makes us know how wonderful and special each and every member of the staff at Le Cirque Las Vegas is. They are impeccable with their anticipation of what you could possibly need or want. They are pristine in the quality of experience they provide.

(Food): From the appetizer, to the main course, to the dessert was incredible. I ordered the duck and to this day (3 years later) is still the best duck i have ever tasted.

The restaurant has a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains, but the interior is so gorgeous and the food is so delicious that you hardly notice them. We started our evening with a creme brûlée martini, which was perfect in every way. The amuse bouche was a salmon rillette and it was Heaven. I started with the beef tartare, which absolutely melted in your mouth. My entree was the sea bass, which was fantastic, but I will admit that my dinner date's rabbit was life changing. I finished the evening with the chocolate soufflé, which is by far the most amazing dessert I've ever had. 

I really wish we had taken the opportunity to return, if only for drinks. It seems like a sin to visit an establishment more than once during a quick trip to Las Vegas, but I could have dined here every day and it wouldn't have been enough.",jPAAnu73q33kwVd4uySuaw,4,4,5,Bfwrtu-o77TA77AluHmhtA

3257460,2015-06-06,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"If I've ever had a better meal, I honestly don't know what it was. Though I've had meals *as good* (see my review of Kabuto from earlier that week!) but where fine dining is concerned, this one took the blue ribbon. There were a couple of minor disappointments. For example, they were out of souffle which made me very sad and earlier they put my friend's medium steak in front of me and my medium rare in front of her, but everything else was so over the top wonderful, it's easy to overlook those things.

There was one other unpleasant thing but it wasn't their fault. There was a young woman at a table near us who just glared at me the entire time she was there. I was dressed nicely, didn't arrive drunk (though I was pretty loaded by the time we left!) and used my best Emily Post type manners. I finally started making faces back at her, which actually amped up the entertainment value enormously!  I almost got up as she was leaving to thank her for keeping me so entertained.

So, the food. Dear lawd. All four of us ordered from the tasting menu and you'll have to forgive me if I forget a thing or two, but let me tell you, if you can't find food you like on here, just please go to Olive Garden and save the caviar and foie gras for people who can truly enjoy it. Because damn.

If you're a wine drinker, I highly recommend working with the somm to pick out something you'll like in your price range. He left me with the list and I summoned him back over to tell him that I had narrowed it down to two or three California Pinot Noirs. He was completely knowledgeable and helped me choose a fabulous George Vineyard, (Russian River Valley) selection. Only $150. Yes, I know that bottle can be purchased for a third of that but this is how this works. If you don't like it, don't order it.  

There was an amuse bouche, with a mojito flavored grenita covered in coconut foam (I think) and decorated with gold. Just lovely.

My first course was Maryland Blue Crab with caviar. Stunning presentation, in the shell and the combination of the sweet crab with the salty caviar made me close my eyes and pray that I get to eat that again some day.

Others had the lobster and avocado salad, which I stole a bite of. Terrific. I wouldn't have traded my crab for it, but I wouldn't have been disappointed if I'd ordered it.

For the next course, two of us ordered the foie, one ordered the rissoto and one ordered the escargot. I got to taste everything and it was all perfection. Our waiter offered us a sweet wine to go with the foie (I wish I could remember what it was) and it was just stellar with that heavy foie. I could have licked the plate. I definitely didn't leave any behind.

For the fish course, I had the sea bass, encrusted in potato. I don't know how they did it and managed to get the potato fully cooked and crispy and have the fish perfectly cooked on the inside, but they did. I could eat this every day.  There were also scallops with caviar at the table for this course and they disappeared in no time - awesome.

We all ordered the wagyu for the beef course and as I said, they delivered the wrong steaks to the wrong ladies, but we're good friends so we just swapped after having taken a bite and discovering they were the wrong doneness.
In the end, we could barely finish those anyway. Well, I finished mine, my friend is much smarter than I am and walked away while she could still breathe.

We all wanted souffle for dessert but he came back with bad news...no souffle.  But they brought us chocolate spheres, which were wonderful. I could only fit in a bite or two. But wow, such a presentation and such creamy, chocolatey goodness.  They also sent us off with a tiny box with two drawers in it, each containing a truffle. So sweet. 

I think our waiter enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed him, either that or he's just so good at his job he can pretend to like anybody. Either way, props to him for putting up with us and taking such great care of us.

If you have the means to try this place once in your life, do it. I didn't have to pick up the check, but if I had I would have felt just fine, knowing we got the best service and best food of our lifetimes.",zbIGTH92-DDDwWDBpSbwJw,3,3,5,c6av3T6QhRj3o5R7oGI9Mg

3285545,2009-10-16,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Simply.  Amazing.

Le Cirque is one of those culinary institutions with a well-deserved reputation for outstanding food and service.  I've wanted to try the flagship in Manhattan... but when I saw the reviews for the Vegas location, I decided to give it a try.

Located inside the posh & glamorous Bellagio hotel, the dining room at Le Cirque overlooks the famous fountain show.  Every fifteen minutes, the fountains come to life through the windows (set to the low-level ambient music of the restaurant instead of tunes you'd be hearing outside).  The decor is circus-themed but very tasteful and subtle.  No scary grinning clowns on the walls.  The tableware features cute little monkeys.  Even though I had no reservation, they took my name and seated me in the lounge for a pre-dinner cocktail... and then called me by name for the evening.  Very personal touch.  The staff were friendly and humorous, and it was easy to talk to them and ask questions during the meal.

I ordered the Degustation Menu, which was an exercise in dining etiquette.  I took a course several years ago about using the proper silverware during formal meals, but these dishes presented me with a number of challenges with silverware I've never even seen before.  Fortunately, the staff didn't comment when I used my salad fork to eat the oyster course.  Oops.  The courses were each exquisite in appearance and taste.  I started with the tiniest oyster and a dollop of caviar, which was creamy and delicious.  The opening lobster salad ""Le Cirque"" was a well-matched jumble of flavors, piled high in a cucumber shell.  The sauteed foie gras was perfectly cooked and seasoned - I've had foie that's over-salted, but this was amazing and the ""verjus"" sauce was rich and bold with unfamiliar but delicious flavor.  The paired pinot gris was so perfect and sweet that I asked the sommelier to give me the name of it - I will be looking for this wine as a staple at home.  Mmmm.

The paupiette of sea bass was really the dish I was most looking forward to, and it didn't disappoint.  This signature dish was just simply divine.  Sitting in Le Cirque, watching the fountains, sipping the same pinot noir that had been reduced to make the sauce... I just wanted to close my eyes and revel in this moment.  Heaven!  The next course was yuzu-glazed duck, and it was probably my least favorite dish of the menu - but it was still excellent.  This was a dish more traditional in flavor and tone.  Duck with citrus is tried and true, not very exciting, but this was well-executed.  At this point I was quite full (and also quite drunk from the wine pairing), and both anticipating and dreading the arrival of dessert.  

The meal ended with pre-dessert (blood orange gelee and foam surrounding a rich pannacotta) and then a huge assortment of desserts.  I can see why they'd call this ""dessert fantasy"" - there were handmade petit fours, a gorgeous souffle with a strawberry cream sauce, and a spoon of tangy and perfect sorbet.  I tasted almost everything but didn't make it very far into the course before I was too full to consider another bite.  This made me sad - I wanted to finish it all!  But the waiter brought me a copy of the menu (so I could know the name of that fabulous pinot gris) and a cute little box with truffles inside.  

Everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the staff, the service, the food, everything.  Given the price, I wouldn't want any disappointments.  The full tasting menu is $125... the standard wine pairing is $65... the signature champagne framboise appertif is $22... and the hot tea I requested with dessert is $4.50.  This is, by far, the most expensive meal I've ever eaten.  But I think it was worth every bite.  The experience filled two hours and I stumbled away into the night, happily sated in both body and soul.",40pYoBJA9rcoXPZqWGyyfg,4,4,5,3UhshAI1RIBlQvVkGGk_MQ

Had the lobster salad as an app, my lovely date had the chilean sea bass, I had the rabbit. Exquisite dinner, deceptively filling. With a couple rounds of cocktails, the meals, the food... the bill came to $300 with tip. Cheaper than I thought it would be, so that was a nice surprise.

I requested a table near the window for the water show and it was reserved for me. Was the perfect start to a romantic evening, and I'm looking forward to going back.

3313338,2016-03-14,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I have dined at this restaurant twice, my parents recommended the place to me as they have dined there many times. I was impressed the first time and decided I wanted to treat my father to a nice meal for our first time going to Vegas together (father and son time). I made a mistake and accidently called the le cirque in new york when googling the number for le cirque (at that time i assumed there was only one le cirque). When we arrived to dinner (assuming we had reservations), we were involved in a very confusing situation where i thought we had reservations but didn't as i had unknowingly called the one in New York. The manager wasn't very nice about the whole situation (I wish i asked for his name, It was not the French manager he was very polite my last visit) I was polite and was not rude while he was defensive and seemed very agitated. Anyways, the restaurant was full but they offered a table behind the cashier/waiter's station so we took it. As i was seated I investigated the number I called and that's when I realized the mistake I had made and this is where my issues with the restaurant began....

 I called the manager over so I can explain the mix up as I thought it was sort of funny and he responded in a condescending way ""Yes I told you, we never make mistakes"" and walked away. 

The second thing that happened that night was my father and I were getting a weird vibe from the waiters, us being seated behind their station, we were able to hear them talking about us when we realized that they thought we were a couple. My father and I were embarrassed and he asked the waiter ""Can you take a picture of my son and I"" so the waiters would know we were related. Right after taking the picture he went back a couple feet to his station and told another waiter ""They're father and son"".  I understand that gossip at work is normal and unavoidable, however, I believe it was disrespectful to be gossiping about us feet away where we could hear. And now i wonder what gossiping occurs when seated in the actual dining room. 

This service greatly affected our dining experience as we did not enjoy our meal. Which is sad as there are many other restaurants in Las Vegas that would have treated us better. I have been to many great restaurants such as Alinea, The Cut, Wp24, Mastros, etc. and have never experienced such an awful service experience such as this one. I believe service is equally important as the quality of the food, a dining experience can be horrible if either one is poor. Since this experience my family and I have never returned and never plan on returning, they could offer me a free meal and I wouldn't accept it.",lmjgby7Img7YjmeNMsmcFQ,1,0,1,fWM48fky78sTFmtP3gOWLA
3313692,2015-02-17,7,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"In a word, disappointing. 

This should be a one star review for the service, but since the drinks were very nice, they get two (one for each Michelin star...what a joke).

My boyfriend and I were very excited to dine here after having read so many excellent reviews and since we began dining at Michelin star restaurants monthly (a New Year's resolution, of sorts). 

I had made a 6:00 reservation and was hoping to order the highly Yelp recommended pre-theatre menu, since we were seeing a 9:00 show. I called to let them know we were running late and we arrived at 6:10. They had us wait five minutes at the bar, even though, when they walked us into the dining room, it was 50% full and seemed laughably overstaffed (so many people standing around with nothing to do, almost in the way).

The decor was nice but it seemed much more extravagant in the pictures. The dining room is surprisingly small, quiet, and brightly lit. We significantly brought down the average age of the diners and I believe we were judged immediately for not being over 60.

We were greeted with menus, 5 minutes after we sat down, and ordered two cocktails. I can't remember the names of the drinks but I believe both had St. Germain in them. I inquired about the pre-theater menu and was told almost immediately that it was no longer available after 6:00*, even though their own menu cites otherwise. At this point, it was 6:25 and I asked our server if it was possible to make an exception since we had a 6:00 reservation and had arrived at 6:10. He told me he'd see what he could do and I was naively optimistic, considering I've worked in fine dining for years and understand that a guest's happiness is the only priority. 

Another person promptly came by to tell us that we could not order the pre-theater menu because the kitchen had already packed up all of the items on it. This seemed like a pathetic excuse, considering most of the items on that menu were now on the regular pre-fixe menu for twice as much money. 

I was annoyed, to say the least. I informed our server that in lieu of the pre-theater menu no longer being available, we would just take the check for our drinks and dine elsewhere. As we waited for the check, I was told that we could sit at the bar and order off of an a la carte menu. At this point, I was visibly upset and didn't care to give this uppity restaurant our business. We signed the check and I left a tip that I'd normally be embarrassed about, but in this case, it felt deservingly appropriate. 

If only we were treated differently, I could be writing a 5 star review like everyone else on Yelp. I'm sure the food is fantastic, but when I go out to eat, the service weighs heavily on my dining experience. 

We ended up dining at Fix, also in the Bellagio, and I plan to write an excellent review about their food and service. We ended up spending over $300 at Fix, in case anyone reading this misjudges my disappointment for frugality, in the way that Le Cirque did. 

I have no problem paying for great food and even better service. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see either at Le Cirque.

3320194,2013-12-27,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"My son & I had dinner reservations for 8pm and arrived promptly. Service from the start was very good, attentive, and somewhat formal. We noticed as we were being seated the ratio of diners to staff was about 3:1, but that being said, there were still a couple of misses in the service, the first and most forgivable, as it was in our favor after all, was the double delivery of the canapés to our table, to which I advised our server that we had already been brought the canapés, the second and the one that really didn't settle well with us was the forgetfulness of the mignardises! This is my favorite and almost the most anticipated part of the meal and the last chance for the chef to leave a good impression. 
I of course did not bring this to the attention of the staff, as to save mine and their embarrassment. I just couldn't bring myself to politely bring it up, so I let it be... they brought me the check, and as I paid I sadly watched the other diners tasting their mignardises... that was for me a big miss. 
Regarding attire, I will say that we were probably the best dressed people there, so I doubt that had anything to do with it, there was a good amount of people in street clothing, sweats & sneakers...I'm not even joking... it true! Very badly dressed people, I'm sure it wouldn't bother most, but if I am paying that type of $$$$, I don't want to be seeing others in sweats... people should make an effort 
ok, on to the food... 
Coming from a day and a half of heavy eating, we decided to each go with the a la carte instead of the tasting menu... appetizer, main & dessert, which was plenty. 
The bread service was ok, bacon bread was tasty but none of the offerings sampled seemed fresh, they would have really benefited from a light oven warming. 
The amuse was a delightful chestnut soup. Regarding the apps ... I had emailed the restaurant 2 weeks prior requesting their Foie Terrine... to which I received no response... I had gotten very busy at work, and really just forgot to follow up, as did they. But being that it was still showing up in their online menu, I didn't really worry.  However, as I perused the menu in the restaurant, I realized there was no Foie Terrine, to which I was informed that it has been replaced with a Foie Gras Parfait... as in mixed with Heavy cream, as in Restaurant Saving $$... half the Foie, twice the profit.  I felt a bit ripped off. 
I did end up ordering the Foie Parfit, which was pretty small in comparison to the pictures I've seen of the Terrine, but It was tasty & smooth... but very light in taste (obviously by the heavy cream) I would have loved the terrine, but oh well... it was served with pretty good brioche bread and atop slices of beets, to which I didn't really like... not sweet enough or tangy enough in comparison to say berries or bitter orange marmalade ... that's my fav combination! 
My son had the Panko crusted egg which was superbly done, and it didn't hurt that it had a nice little dollop of caviar! I could have that for a decadent brunch anyday!
For our mains, my son's Lobster was over cooked and rubbery, a sad dish and if you are going to charge a supplement ($15) you better make sure it's worth it... but it wasn't. I had the good but safe Prosciutto wrapped monkfish. Yummy, but really nothing I couldn't do at home.
For dessert, son had the Chocolate Ball and I had the Grand Marnier Soufflé to which we both agree were both overly sweet.  There's a word in Spanish ""empalagante"" which doesn't really have a proper translation, but really describes the desserts perfectly... Great taste, but way too sweet. 
Overall, we both gave it 7 out of 10... there's plenty of room for improvement. Really want to try Twist next for excitement and Picasso for upscale ""comfort"" food.",4T_FLzTM94cOiQdSrY8Vjw,1,0,3,fgMgaLF1yRv463SYlPpO-w

It was beautifully presented and just the right amount for a first course. For the second course we got the risotto. This was a very rich dish so I appreciated that the portion was small for this course. For the third course my husband got the sea bass and I got the scallop. Another great dish. I loved the play on textures with each course. For our fourth course I got the chicken. My husband upgraded his steak to Kobe for an additional charge. It was so worth it. He said it was the best steak he had ever eaten. For dessert we ordered one of each again. I had food envy over my husband's dessert. He ordered the chocolate ball.

3333267,2013-03-11,4,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I have now dined at all of the Bellagio's fine dining-level restaurants, and Le Cirque is my second favorite behind Prime.  The food was of very high quality, and the service and atmosphere was superb.  I would recommend Le Cirque if you are looking for an enjoyable and intimate dinner among the Bellagio's top notch eateries.

I opted for the a la carte menu to give myself the freedom to splurge on some highlight dishes, though there is a $72 pre-theater menu for those visiting a show afterward or a full $135 tasting menu.  The Langoustine et Caviar was an excellent appetizer--langoustine topped with caviar topped with edible gold leaf.  And unlike the gold leaf, the caviar is not just for show--it complements the langoustine well together with the shellfish champagne sauce base.  This isn't the best langoustine dish on The Strip--that honor goes to Joël Robuchon--but it certainly was no slouch in itself.

My main dish was the Le Filet de Boeuf Wagyu Japonais, which is Kobe beef tenderloin (albeit just five pieces of it) cooked just right at medium rare.  The dish comes with a few very small accompaniments: a spoonful of truffled (and very very buttery) mashed potatoes, a mushroom, and a pepper.  The portioning definitely reminded you that this was not a steakhouse, but this did not at all take away from the experience as a whole.  (I ended up getting a massive dessert, anyway.)  I would personally recommend Prime, though, if you are really looking to enjoy the quality of Japanese-imported Kobe.  Watch out for that pepper!

Grand Marnier Soufflé for dessert.  I was surprised that this was offered to me after I finished my entrée because the extra preparation time needed for soufflés usually required it to be ordered along with the rest of your meal.  I asked about this and was assured that the wait would not be significant.  In this case, however, I was disappointingly in the right.  Once it arrived, however, it was very good--light and fluffy combined with a really good Grand Marnier sauce.

As for the other aspects of Le Cirque, the dining room seemed small (in a good way) compared to the other Bellagio restaurants, and the effect is accentuated by the circus tent canopy ceiling to go along with the circus murals on the walls.  The restaurant has a great view of the Bellagio fountains, though unless you are towards the middle of the room, your view will be obstructed by large window pillars.  The wine list is extensive and intimidating, but the sommelier's light-hearted attitude (""Hey, it's just grape juice!"") eased the tension.  Then again, when you see the whole page of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti with prices ranging from $1,100 to several tens of thousands of dollars, you know that this is some serious grape juice.  The bread service was pretty good:  The bacon bread comes as close as anyone to the best bacon bread I've ever had (at the Caesar Palace Guy Savoy), and the rosemary bread was also very good.  Service was at a very high level--the waiter substituted a black napkin for a white one, which was the first time I explicitly noticed such a switch at a restaurant.

The final damage for one diner was $350 including tip and two wines by the glass (an excellent Sancerre to start and a robust Cabernet Sauvignon to pair with the beef tenderloin).",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,4,4,4,kkG7ZOW2xs2K9l1jUYVLTQ

My boyfriend and I went to Le Cirque with great expectations. When we arrived and through the experience the service was phenomenal and that is why they got 2 stars. 
Let me get to the major problems we faced. Our main dishes came out at around 11pm when the restaurant closes. Not only was my chicken room temperature at best but my boyfriend's single lamb chop was pretty much raw. We both love very rare meat but when the fat has not been rendered at all and is completely cold and chewy then we have a problem. 
We sent the two dishes back and they apologized for the food being cold and not cooked. They said they would remake everything. Well at 1130 and a complete empty restaurant, our entrees were brought out again. At that point we had been there for 2.5 hrs. We asked them to box everything up and that we wanted to leave. The final portion of the tasting menu was the dessert which we didn't even experience. They gave us a box of macarons to take with us as well.
 I was pretty shocked to say the least. Not only did they royally mess up the main course but we didn't even have the dessert. They saw we wanted to get out of there so they brought us the bill. Too bad that dinner was so disappointing and for $450 was a waste of money and our time. I'm glad we experienced Le cirque because it's supposedly one of the best restaurants in Vegas but needless to say we will not be back. For that kind of price tag the food better be perfect and you better serve all of it to your customers. Very disappointing how the entire situation was handled by the restaurant.",-h8t_V9dUVrg81lHnFkrDQ,2,0,2,ESX8n5CWBXkgy3gkYiCXnQ

We both got sea bass as our main course. I'd never had it prepared this way and I have never had it better.
The chocolate ball is a fun dessert, a little sweet for my taste but not for my wife and it was scrumptious. And the port pairing was spot on again.

The desserts were AH-MAZING.  Because there were four of us, they offered us four different desserts that we all shared.  The Creme Brulee was HEAVENLY and was definitely my favorite of the bunch.

There was one point where we had 3 waiters at our table: 1 was filling up our water, 1 was cleaning off the table, and 1 was bringing additional food. Talk about VIP service.
 
-Amuse Bouche: I honestly don't remember what it was but it was like a corn soup deal (they switch their amuse bouche throughout the night btw) but it was warm, savory and yummy
-Foie Gras Special with sangria and a side of cooked date and fig (not on the menu): DELICIOUS! I'm a big fan of foie gras so the sangria gave it a nice oomph to it. Nice way to start off the meal
-Chilean Sea Bass: Not the typical kind that I was used to (really oily, delicious and yummy) since this was more fried on the outside. Still good but not exactly what I was hoping it'd be
-Rabbit symphony: Very, very rich tasting but worth a try. It's full of flavor but like I said, it's extremely rich so if you're not a fan of that, maybe you shouldn't try this.
-Chocolate sphere dessert: Got this whole show going on where you melt hot chocolate onto it and the sphere breaks, revealing the hazelnut goodness inside. THIS was really delicious
-Crème Bruelee: Pretty standard but they give you a generous amount

I like ordering prix fixe menus (I splurged on the $145 menu) because it gives me a chance to sample the general style of the restaurant and chef without giving me too much of a headache. I was not disappointed in the least because the food was so tasty, fresh, tender, perfectly cooked to my liking, etc. 
The food was excellent. There was nothing that I didn't like. Here is a list of some things that were on the 9-course prix fixe menu for the day I went (it changes daily):
-Lobster salad 
-Sauteed Fois Gras with Macerated Fruit and Hazelnuts (YUM !!!!)
-Colorado rack of Lamb with Tender Vegetables and Lobster Jus

I was feeling adventurous and decided to hone my wine-aficionado tastes by adding wine parings to my meal (an additional $65). The best idea I've had this week. Chateau Gravas Saternes, I have found you as my new love :D

The service was prompt and helpful, yet not as attentive as other places I have been to. There is a spectacular view of the Bellagio water fountain show out of the windows.

The reason why I didn't rate this place a five, however, is that the tables are way too close to others, making it difficult to walk and just noisy in general. There were actually many large groups at this restaurant, and though I was happy that everyone was having a good time, it took away from the classiness of this place.

I'd like to mention that the service here is some of the most silent, effortless and efficient that I've ever had. The environment is truly over the top circus big top. Very luxe but with a kaleidoscopic hallucinogenic feel. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I can see how it could be seen as just plain gaudy to some.
Our courses were all excellent, but the foie stood out and our Sauternes was exceptional, and should be given the pricing on the premium pairings. I'm glad we went with the upgrade. It was our honeymoon so they brought extra desserts and the chef came out to congratulate us. There are other places in vegas I will pick before going back next time, but it was a wonderful experience. I prefer fixed menus where there are no choices except if you wish to have the options and upgrades or not, but this does provide a little bit of control for those who don't like stepping away from the a la carte menu completely. The creme brulee also stood out, and I'm not usually a sweets fan. My wife was in heaven with what ended up being 5 dessert courses including the mignardises and gourmandises. Definitely a treat for those with a sweet tooth.

Our meal was delicious.  Extremely memorable.  Service was great.  Decor was beautiful and playful.  We saw a famous football player.
This is currently my top meal of all time.  The dish that really took the cake was the additional supplement we got of risotto topped with huge shavings of black truffles.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  A heaven filled with roundish black mushrooms!
The desserts deserve a special mention - we got the 'circus of desserts' which includes basically all their desserts and you should totally do it if you have a big group - all the deserts were delicious and special (check out the picture of the yuzu cream and strawberry sorbet in a bowl made out of ice!).

3641091,2010-03-22,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Our party decided to do the degustation menu. Here is what I think... First course, Lobster salad, there was nothing not to like when it came to the bright clean and refreshing flavor but when you bite into the lobster the only thing that came to mind is chewy and rubbery as if it were boiled/poached way too long.  Next course, the much anticipated foie gras which sadly came cold and rather under cooked with a texture that was flat, lumpy and fleshy. Despite that the paring of the spiced bread and asian pear was terrific and unique. The bass was surprisingly my favorite course, it was everything you want a fish dish to be. Light bursting with delicate flavor yet subtle enough to not over power the fish itself. Although I would have imagined the paupiette to be crisp it was more soggy and soaked through, yet again another dish where taste over ruled texture. My main course the glazed duck came remarkably short of expectation by any standard. Again it came very cold (not even warm) lacking all flavor and texture. There seemed to be no balance in this dish. I was confused on whether or not the skin was supposed to have been crispy but got stale or was just stale. It was most likely cooked to the perfect med-rare and could have been amazing right off the line.  My assumption is because of the lack of enough waitstaff the dish was probably sitting for too long before being served. Here the desserts very much out shone the rest of dinner. If I had to go back I would make this place a stop after dinner just for dessert and drinks in the bar area. The souffle was probably the best I've ever had . It was impossibly airy and light, total perfection! The gigantic chocolate ball reminded me of a ferrero rocher de-ca-dent! On to service... As noted earlier there seemed to be an obvious lack in enough wait staff. They were courteous and not over bearing yet, they seemed unrelaxed and somewhat stressed and frantic. Ambience was interestingly enough a bit disheveled but fun with a circus tent atmosphere. We also did the wine paring which put our bill for two well over $400 making the value to service to food to ambience ratio much lower for a restaurant doting a reputation of such a high calibre. In the end with all the amazing places Las Vegas has to offer its a wonder how they can remain on the forefront of so many ""best-of"" lists. Great place to eat once just to say that you did.

Went to Le Cirque with 15 other people.  Yes that is correct 15.  They put together 3 or 4 different tables and chairs for our rather large group.  Seating was tight but this is not a huge place so there is a trade off.

1) Salad.  Maine Lobster salad.
2) 2nd course was pate de foie gras
3) 3rd course for me was the duck
4) 4th course was the Kobe beef.
5) Dessert with 15 people there were 15 different desserts.  I did not partake in any but they looked fantastic.

What sounds like a bacchanal of food really was not.  It was very much a taster menu so each course except for dessert was 2 to three bites of food.  Out of all the dishes I had the duck was the best.  Best duck I have ever had or will ever eat.  It was cooked to perfection and the taste was mouth watering delicious.

The other 14 diners had a wine paring with every course.  Since I am a former drinker all I could do was listen to the sommelier tell everyone what a great choice each wine was with the meal.  I believe him after all he was from France and it is a French restaurant so if he does not know know who does.  This of course is a once in a life time meal and Le Cirque gave all 15 of us a once in a life time meal.  Oh yeah after the meal we watched O.

I thought to myself afterwards: so this must be what it feels like to be a Democrat in a room full of Republicans...

After months of research and comparison, needless to say, I was exultant over my Christmas day/Anniversary dinner reservation with Le Cirque. I was looking forward to this decadent dinner for months even prior to my arrival to Las Vegas. 

When this evening finally arrived, I practically was skipping all the way from my room in Cosmopolitan to Bellagio. Upon arrival, the hostess told us that they're prepping our table for us, I thought to myself: Yes, just like what I requested over the phone, they're seating us at the table with a nice view of the Bellagio fountain (which was suggested to me when I mentioned this will be a third year anniversary dinner with my BF.) After 45 minutes of waiting and two cocktails (during which time we had a fantastic time with the gentleman who was attending the bar,) we were finally seated. Our table was two rows away from the window seats, while there were other empty window seats that were left unoccupied. 

Don't get me wrong, the food and the services were beyond amazing. We had the pleasure of ordering out of the entire Christmas Day tasting menu (since there were two options from each category.) Somehow, I still felt strangely awkward. I enjoyed dishes such as Le Cirque's famous lobster & avocado salad, creamy risotto with alba white truffles, Japanese A5 wagyu kobe beef, and of course, the chocolate ball.

It wasn't until I left the restaurant, I realized no one had mentioned anything about my 3-year anniversary with my BF. We didn't get any of those treatments that people raved about when they decided to come to Le Cirque to celebrate their relationships' milestone. My BF on the other hand, had a wonderful experience. I guess in the end that's all it mattered. But, if someone asks: would I go back to Le Cirque again the next time I'm in Vegas? Probably not.

Now onto the difficult part. Amuse bouche was... interesting. Rambutan with roe and gold flakes. I've never eaten gold before..which is fun to say that I have now. It was seasoned with fish sauce? Threw off my taste buds. 

For the appetizer, my husband's hamachi was light and fresh. I had the Burgundy Snails (escargot) and...I'm not going to lie, it made my stomach turn. I'm not sure what went wrong. I thought in the moment that it might be too rich.. but I am also the girl that grew up in the south and I know rich/heavy food. I didn't touch much of this dish and tried to let the abdominal pain pass.

Food portions were smallish, but that is kind of expected for a tasting menu. I actually wasn't completely full after finishing the entire 5-course meal...unfortunately, but it was still filling.

Their A4 Kobe beef was the winner of the meal...closely followed by their sauteed foie gras, but beware, the small 2"" by 3"" piece of Kobe beef also came with an additional supplement cost of $65...

Good solid restaurant, however, the ambiance was not very romantic. It honestly felt more like a casual restaurant that served fancier food. Service was was not very personable or friendly. The servers came off aloof and very curt with their descriptions for each dish.

I'd label us as ""amateur foodies,"" meaning we don't know everything there is to know about food, but we love trying new things. Dining at a place like this was a first for both of us, and I was a little intimidated. My fears were quickly allayed. The staff was attentive, but not overbearing. Formal, but incredibly warm and welcoming, not to mention humorous at times. They kindly explained how to read the menu when we admitted that we were newbies and a little confused. 

We both ordered from the degustation tasting menu, and were told it was best for us to order different items so that we could try more things. We had planned on doing this in the first place, but I was relieved to know that we wouldn't look out of place eating from each other's plates, as this was the point. The food was just out of this world. There were a couple of things that we ate for the first time, and we were beyond impressed.

Our orders were:
1. Tasting of Tomatoes & Japanese Yellowtail with Hearts of Palm
2. Sautéed Foie Gras w/ Peaches & Burgundy Snails
3. Potato Crusted Sea-Bass & Seared Scallops
4. Lamb w/Sautéed Sweetbreads & Kobe Beef 
5. Chocolate Ball & Gran Marnier Soufflé 

I also had the wine pairings, and Frederic, the sommelier, poured and explained each one personally. You can tell Frederic was not only knowledgeable, but really excited about what he did. This just kicked it up to a different level. As a whole, the staff made us feel like VIPs, seriously.

The ambiance is very formal, but also very comfortable, and the space itself is beautiful. As far as dress code, published dress code is dressy and elegant, and jackets are ""recommended but not required.""  We were dressed up for dinner, and I think they appreciated that and saw it as being respectful of the establishment. One member of the wait staff told a story about a gentleman who showed up for his reservation in shorts. This said to me that they not only notice what you wear, but they remember. 

As people who don't do this often, we were both just so blown away by the experience. And that's exactly what this is. An experience. Not just dinner. Yes, it was expensive, but for what we got, it was totally worth it. I would do this every day, if I could.

Perhaps the reputation, the history and the awards of the restaurant are blocking the fellow Yelpers perception of the reality. The restaurant is small which is not a bad thing BUT all the tables are positioned so close to each other that there is no privacy and you are getting this feeling of ""too close for comfort"",  rubbing elbows with the diners from the near tables and can't not help hearing their conversations. The decor is posh but too heavy for a small place. The colorful fabric covering the ceiling hanging low creating the effect of a circus tent is claustrophobic,   I understand it's purpose to reflect the ambiance of 18th century era of the French circus but today this decor seems just old, outdated and suffocating . The French windows are dark and too small to enjoy the wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains so don't expect a dinner and a show. The crowd .... no sophisticated foodies to say the least ... 
Now the most important part the food. Yes it is good but not to die for, not amazing, not fantastic as it should be for the legendary place they claim to be. And what is with the pre-fix menu and no option a la carte ?  Are they pushing you to spend more $$ because they can't fit enough people in this small crowded space..? The presentation of every dish is impressive  but the service kills it, it is ROBOTIC with no personality.

The 3 bottles of wine didn't help either, not to mention I know that the New York Le Cirque is expensive (which is why I've never been to that one).

I'm not sure if this is their standard dinner, but dinner was a three course pre-fixe meal for $98.  Not bad considering this was Le Cirque, but definitely up there (I mentioned the 3 bottles of wine right?)  Everything on the menu looked fairly good, so it was actually reasonably difficult to pick an entree.  With a table of 8, we all happened to select a good mix of appetizers.  Mine being the escargot, it was very tasty, yet rich.  The dish had ample snails to go around, that I just had to share.  They were that rich I couldn't finish.  The other appetizers on the table looked as pretty as they were delicious according to my dinner party.

The actual entree menu was split into a traditional side and a contemporary side.  Interesting for a table of 8, we had a total of 2 actual entrees.  2 ordered the poached lobster with king crab ravioli, and 6 ordered the chilean sea bass - I ordered the latter, though I wished for the former when they came to the table.  Though cooked nicely, I thought the mushrooms that came underneath the fish were tastier than the actual fish.

Did I mention that before the appetizer and before the entree they gave us a little more food?  Probably adding to the bill, but the 2 additional ""meals"" were yummy - some kind of mushroom soup thing, and the risotto.  The risotto again being very rich, I couldn't even finish it.

What I found interesting was in between the appetizer and the entree wasn't just the risotto, but was a long long long wait.  Too long considering this fancy schmancy restaurant.  I think even they realized they were moving a bit too slow for food service, because as they offered us our entrees, they suggested for the table to just take a sample serving of desserts....to ""save time"".  Although they tried to make it seem like it was saving time for us, me thinks it was saving them some time.

I don't think the table could have complained anyway, as the sample serving of desserts basically involved them bringing us 8 completely different desserts...so we just took a bit and passed them along.  Eventually, we each found a dessert we liked.  Thank goodness no one was allergic to anything.

Overall, I honestly was torn between a 3.5 to 4 star rating.  Honestly it was because of the wait between dishes.  What was their saving grace though was their quality and presentation of their food.  To dine at Le Cirque is truly all about the experience.

Just be prepared to pay for it.",LZPtLWnjGZVODlhZk_uPdg,0,0,4,2Hc_nSR8bvyTIiSWfl_mmw

The walls are painted artistically in dramatic shades of orange, red, and jewel tones. The high ceilings are made of drawn up fabric that looks like you're inside a tent. Each table had plush furniture and there were whimsical painted murals of circus scenery and animals. 

The dinner was an experience, one surprise after another. I tried so many new flavors in this one meal, enough to evoke a foodie inkling inside of me. I can't remember exactly what each dish was, but I tried white asparagus appetizer, a shot of some sort of green soup, an apple tartin, raspberry sorbet. I had a sparkling dessert wine and a red wine with my entree of truffle stuffed chicken. A standout was my appetizer, foie gras roasted with blackberries, apricots, and red potatoes. We were also offered complementary petit fors, which were artfully layered and sinfully good. I would recommend for anyone who wants to experience daring French food and likes the finer things in life!

3918705,2017-11-27,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"This was the best restaurant meal I've ever had, better than anything in my city. I've yet to visit Chicago, NYC, or California though, so I know it's only a temporary place holder. There's that identifying marker of a great restaurant where everything is perfectly balanced, not too salty, sweet, acidic, etc. I can only count a handful of restaurants that fit that bill. When we arrived they had asked us whether we were going to see a show, which we were and we had a 2 hour period before that was an issue. Since they made this a big deal, we assumed they had a system. We ordered the 5 course instead of the 10 course due to time restraints. We were informed this would work out well for our time limit. Everything went fine, everything was great. Then there was a giant lull between the third and the main course. Which was okay, because we had very large drinks and lots of bread and butter to consume. A couple that had arrived there an hour after us started complaining about where their main course was. There was a large 12-15 top there. Then they brought the pre-dessert balls, and we asked where our main course was. He apologized, and out came the main course, quickly after that the pre-dessert, the dessert from the menu and then then a plate of macarons, jellies, etc. In a matter of 5-10 minutes. All of that would have been fine, except the main course was cold. The A5 Wagyu that was $35 an ounce on top of the price of the normal dish itself was suppose to be medium rare, but was well past medium. It was all brown on the inside. It was still tender, but I've had hundreds of pieces of meat better than that. Even the Buffet down the hall's prime rib was better. The croquette was soggy and obviously cold. It became apparent that they had basically forgotten to server our main course, but we didn't have time to worry about it. Probably sat on the pass for a while. I'm assuming due to the larger table. Of course, we were about 10 minutes late to our show, where our friend informed us we missed the beginning that was the best part.",d_e5biCpnN-gse6IcJpQLg,0,0,4,GZxVl8lKUPES4LGu67diJg

I had a group of friends in town for a couple days and we were so happy with our dining experience here that we immediately booked a second visit during their short trip.

Let's get the décor out of the way, because I rarely if ever comment or care much about the ambiance of restaurants - but I love the décor and layout of the restaurant and ambiance here. It is cozy without being confined, intimate without being too loud, and just overall feels romantic. It's such a lovely place to be.

Service is also top notch in every way. With French restaurants, I am always scared of the staff being pretentious or even condescending. Here, the staff are incredibly well-trained and knowledgeable, and show attention to detail while not at all being overbearing or pretentious. The sommelier was wonderful to talk to about wines all throughout dinner, and engaged us with discussions on the various vineyards and regions that his pairing picks were from.

Finally, the best and most important part - food is great. I would describe Le Cirque as top-notch execution with sufficient innovation to keep things interesting. My personal favorites for appetizers were the yuzu hamachi with avocado, the poached egg ravioli with mushrooms, and the langoustines with caviar. For the big dish, I loved the rabbit tasting, duck, and dover sole.

Don't skip the desserts either. Between our two trips we tried every one on the menu and they were all great. My personal favorite was the yuzu, strawberries, and cream served in an ice bowl. Just decadent in every way.

The bartender was so kind, we were talking about Hawaii (he is from there and we just went there). The wine selection is one of the largest I have seen. The bread selection was overwhelming! I wanted to eat them all! Love how the butter is room temp. So many restaurants over look this tiny detail and its so disappointing to have wonderful bread and hard butter. 
I started with the escargot (amazing flavor, cooked to perfection, not chewy at all!), my fiancee had the frois gras which was so rich and creamy.  
Main course I had the potato encrusted sea bass with pinot reduction. So light and flakey. Fish melted like butter. My fiancee had the butter poached lobster with lobster stuffed tortellini. I can't even describe accurately how fabulous this dish is. 
Now on to one of the best parts... dessert! I had the Grande Marnier soufflé. For those who said it tasted like straight liqueur are out of their mind! It tasted like sweet oranges to me! Creme Brûlée was the best I have ever had. The Tahitian  vanilla makes all the difference. 
The service was so hands on and friendly. Considering the type of place this is you would think the servers would be a little up tight. But the were all so nice and accommodating.

3955667,2014-01-27,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I had no expectations walking into Le Cirque for dinner, it was just unplanned and pretty much winging it. I was surprised to find a reservation slot at 8pm the morning of, and luckily it wasn't so busy on a Sunday night. 

We were seated in the middle of the circus ring, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Too bad my back was turned towards the fountains otherwise I wouldn't be talking to my friends at the table at all. Overall, the setting is very clustered, if you're a bit claustrophobic, good luck.

Like always, our table was probably the youngest ones at the restaurant. Perhaps that might be the case which I felt a bit rushed through during the first half of my dining session. We ended up all getting the degustation menu which consists of amuse bouche, appetizer, another appetizer, fish dish, meat dish, pre dessert, mini tarts, and main dessert. As always, you can describe the meal portions as ""meals for ants"" but really, all those courses can add up, especially with a lot of heavier ingredients for the courses in the middle. 

I ended up ordering the uni panna cotta, foie gras, prusciutto wrapped monkfish, veal cheeks, and the vanilla poached strawberry.  Overall, my dishes were absolutely great but not enough to amaze me. Overall, the dishes were not eye opening in terms of originality. I was a bit surprised at how much was influenced by Japanese cuisines. They made all of their ingredients to its perfection. A lot of stuff going on with the textures moreso than flavors. You have a few different types of ""smooth and creamy"" going on in the uni panna cotta, a bit of an differentiating layers in the foie gras, a little bit of the dry and chewy in the prusciutto versus the moist and tender monk fish, different aspects of ""melting in your mouth"" within the creamy polenta and the veal cheeks. Especially my predesert, it was a tequila sorbet with strawberry poprocks and gelee. It was such a fun dish! Hell, it was a fun meal overall. But wait! I haven't even told you how in awe I was with my dessert, the vanilla poached strawberry. Other than my strawberry compote at L'Atelier, this is the only other time I was too shocked about how my dessert came out to be. I had no idea how to begin! My strawberries in yuzu cream were all served in an ice bowl that was stacked on top of these pinkish icy rocks on a silver plate. It looked like an inverse volcano of some sort. I felt like an little kid eating a strawberry sundae. Gorgeous piece! I'm so glad the server refused to let me change my order to the Grand Marnier souffle. 

For the food and the atmosphere, this place deserves a 5 star ranking. However, for the service during the first half of the meal, I'm dropping a star. Mainly because I felt unwelcome with most of my meal rushed up, I didn't completely enjoy my dining experience. Luckily when the crowd had died down, our server had carried a few talks with us, gave us this chocolate cabinet (or rather mini cabinet with chocolates). But that was more like second half of the meal, better late than never.

3971649,2012-02-25,4,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"This was one of the top dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional with two small nit picks. I found the service to be excellent. 

I had a reservation for opening at 5:30.  I wanted to have a slow meal with time left over to get from the Bellagio to a show at the Venetian at 9 PM.  I was seated promptly.  I was immediately given menus and asked if I had a show or other time constraint.  Explaining my need to be at the Venetian by 8:30 to get my tickets, my server and I agreed I had lots of time for an unhurried meal.  (I should note for one of my Yelp friends--I was offered a darker napkin option from white as I was wearing dark pants.  I kept the white.)

They had four options.  There were two dégustation menus--a regular one and a black truffle one.  They also have three course pre-theatre dinners and à la carte selections.  I ordered and iced tea which was quickly brought.  I looked at the truffle menu, but I had already decided on the regular dégustation from looking at their online menu.  There were some changes to the menu.  I ordered and the delightful dining began.

Bread service consisted of several kinds of rolls.  I chose an onion and bacon roll.  I really appreciated the butter.  It was in two sections--one unsalted and one salted.  I am not a fan of unsalted butter.  The butter was shaped in the Le Cirque logo and was thin in depth so it became soft quickly which is another plus for me.  I hate fighting with near-frozen unsalted butter.

An amuse-blouche of a soup with a quail egg on top started the evening.  There were a couple of pieces of Iberico ham referred to as bacon truffle in the liquid.  It was very good.  There was a thin toast round on top of the glass and it was suggested I take the spoon and pierce though to the egg and goodness below.  I wish I had noted the soup on which the quail sat but I was more intent on getting a photo and then eating.

Course one was New Zealand langoustine topped with some osetra caviar and edible gold leaf.  The plate was adorned with some tapioca, passion fruit, and apple and vodka gelée.  I liked the langoustine, but the adornments were more for that than for a taste point of view.  It was beautiful plating and pleasing to the eye.  

Course two was Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Royale with king crab and a lemon grass emulsion.  It was served in a white cup that would remind you of a sea animal.  Great plating idea and very tasty.  The sea urchin and crab were superb!

Course three was wild Atlantic turbot with roasted sunchokes, chanterelles, a celeriac purée, artichoke chips, and Barigoule sauce.  The fish was very good.

Course four was different from what I had planned.  The online menu has not been updated.  I was going to get their venison, but the menu had rotated and they hadn't changed the online version yet.  Instead, I got duck with a port wine reduction with a potato puff.  The duck was so moist and tasty and the duck jus was excellent!  The potato puff was so good I wanted to get another.  It was like you puffed a french fry after removing the potato from inside its out wrapping.  The reduction had solidified on the plate and was one point where I wondered why it was done.  A little nit pick.  Maybe it was a plating reason.

At this point, you have a choice of cheese or pre-dessert.  When I found out the pre-dessert was sorbet, I ordered the cheese.  It was a cows milk cheese from Switzerland served with some candied walnuts and two raisin bread rounds.  The cheese was delicately sculptured and the cheese course was very good.  The cheese was just a tiny bit on the way to sharp.

There were several desserts for the finishing touches.  I had ordered coconut soufflé.  They also had chocolate and Grand Marnier soufflés but he had me as soon as he said coconut.  With the soufflé was a spoon of mango sorbet and a container of chopped mango and pineapple.  The spoon of sorbet was kept in place on the plate with some brown sugar so when you picked up the spoon to have some sorbet, you also got some sugar sweetness.  Very clever and tasty!  Accompanying the soufflé, as if this wasn't enough dessert, were four mignardises--a lemon merengue tart, a raspberry tart, a caramel puff, and a dark, unsweetened chocolate goodness.  I felt guilty eating all these sweet things--well 2 seconds of guilt, that's all!

Service was impeccable except for my other nit pick.  As soon as you finished a course, a young man was there almost immediately to remove the plate so you didn't sit with a dirty dish.  The one time, he was almost too quick to remove the plate.  I was still eating a piece of bread when he removed the plate.  It wasn't to hurry me.  It was simply so you had a clean table in front of you.   He brought me a new glass of iced tea when my first one was almost empty.

4042992,2014-12-30,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Expecting to pay outrageous to try this restaurant out. A group of five us came in for dinner. One of the best values. Fancy restaurants usually mean small unfulfilling portions.

Decor runs with the Le Cirque theme on paintings, ceiling, and French style dining area. Visually appealing and harmonious to enjoy while eating.  

Staff was friendly, helpful and prompt upon checking in for dinner. Wait staff was congenial and answered any questions about the menu. A good variety on the regular menu and prefix choices on pretheatre for the O. There are choices for the sensitive or dietary restrictions (allergies, vegetarian et). 

A drink order was taken and delivered at a good pace with the meals. Water refills were consistent to enjoy the various aspects of our meals. We were fairly quick on our decisions with none of us ordering the same appetizer or salad, main dish or dessert. 

Amuse bouche was served to cleanse the pallets. A nice cold soup. Refreshing it was and should be. 

Staff returned fairly quick with a large bread basket of all types offered for our party. If you are dining as a couple the bread waiter will circle around the tables a la carte style. Good selections of not common flavor on taste buds. 

The appetizers were served at a good pace from here. Amazement to the eyes and tantalizing on the buds. Some appetizer we tried include pomegranate salad, tartar, the seasonal risotto. Nothing was left on these dishes.
The salad was sweet, light, and refreshing. The tartar was rare and tender to my enjoyment. Risotto was just scrumptious with the lobster. All good proportion to pair well with our each selected main entrees.

Some of the entrees we ordered include the roasted chicken, salmon, filet, foie gras. The entrees were paired with appropriate seasonal vegetables.

Each of us enjoyed the dishes we ordered. The salmon was cooked as requested. Topped with a nice sauce. Good balance. The chicken fell off of the bone with lots of flavor. The foie gras was so good (tender like a good cut of beef). The filet was cooked to the medium rare desired. Each of us were happy with our choices. The wine paired with the entree ordered was good. Not a bad choice. Healthy sized. Most of us were full at this time. Well portioned for a great entree. 

Dessert was short to arrive from there. Each of us again elected to try something different from. 

A hazelnut filled dark chocolate, raspberry lemon, and Creme brûlée. Desserts each had their delicate nature but big on flavor. Most desserts were large enough for two people to share. As we were celebrating a birthday, a dessert platter of various desserts was also brought up. Little chocolates and truffles. So great on the eyes. The wines paired were distinct in taste.

The check and bill settlement was quick. 

Staff was consistently, friendly, helpful, and 
efficient. Food was well portioned, seasoned exceptionally, and thoughtfully constructed. Beverages were paired to the meals. 

Good: everything. 
Bad: nothing.

4057284,2007-08-23,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"This is the second time that I have been here (the first being at their signature NYC establishment), and I have to admit that this was an amazing experience compared to the first. Set against the back drop of the famous Bellagio water fountain, they managed to convert the circus decor into something rather elegant. That, for me, was an amazing achievement since I am still haunted by that crazy clown from Stephen King's book/movie IT. Admittedly though, the quarters were slightly cramped more than I had hoped, so much that I felt as if I was participating in the neighboring table's conversation. But at least everyone tries to speak in a slightly hushed tone. Furthermore, the restaurant claims that a tie and jacket are required. I have to be honest - the only people that were wearing the preferred attire were the waiters and me. Everyone else was in the jeans and a button up (maybe a few khakis).

Now, moving on to the more important affair of that evening, the food. I ordered the Prix Fixe plus the wine pairing. Although I cannot recall the menu course for course, I will tell you that the food was fantastic. The wines matched the food perfectly, and the food was well balanced and not too heavy. Since we had gone for an anniversary/birthday, they even wrote Happy Birthday and Anniversary on the dessert plates (except I think most any restaurant will do that). 2 hours later, I was happily drunk and plump. This definitely ranked high amongst my dining experiences and I think it's a great place to go for any special occasion. 

Summary:
1) Slightly cramped quarters
2) Good service - not the best. We had a friendly waiter who was not a supercilious snob. But I have had weird yet great experiences where the help goes so far to open the bathroom doors for you.
3) French accents = Fake?

The veal cheeks alone was almost worth the price of the meal. One of the best bites of red meat that I ever had.

The sea urchin and the foie gras were also perfect. The portion of foie gras was surprisingly large for a tasting menu.  The sea urchin was also the best I ever had, though I have had that many sea urchin before.

The prosciutto wrapped monk fish was the only dish less than perfect. It wasn't bad by any means, but the prosciutto taste kind of over whelms the monk fish taste.

In sum, the veal cheeks alone is worth the trip, sea urchin and foie gras made it a freaking bargain, and everything else were great option on top.",NjKncZuGEU9NGWxEmtHD-g,2,2,5,359qSbtUcDc2Slj4qlBe8Q

Are you SURE you're ready??

Le Cirque's stellar reputation is well-deserved, as it is a sure treasure not only within the Bellagio hotel but all along the Las Vegas Strip.  Among the many recommended restaurants up and down Las Vegas Boulevard, Le Cirque is not to be missed.  

This certainly qualifies as a ""fancy"" restaurant.  Though I don't think tie and jacket are required, diners are certainly NOT in jeans.  The prices are high-er, but honestly compared to many other of the wonderful and even not so wonderful restaurants in Vegas, one really can get quite a bang for his or her buck - items may be ordered à la carte, however Le Cirque offers a large and smaller prixe fixe option so you are able to taste much of what Le Cirque has to offer for a reasonable bill.

As high class as Le Cirque is, I never felt as if we were being looked down upon by any of the staff, who are ALL excited and knowledgable about Le Cirque's offerings.  The staff at a place like this is more than accommodating, and are working there for many reasons other than supporting themselves financially.  

So what did we eat?!  We had the signature lobster salad, escargot (possibly best I've ever had), the rabbit, the sea bass, the chocolate boule and the crème brulée.  Oh, and the wonderful bread assortment and confection assortment that accompanied the meal.  I love sea bass and was un-familiar with this preparation of it - it was possibly baked in the potato casing it was wrapped in, or maybe steamed prior to... What really made the dish were the braised leaks and pinot noir reduction sauce the sea bass pocket was placed on top of.  A beautiful combination of tastes. (Not to mention the perfectly paired glass of pinot noir I had alongside the meal...)  Also, the butter the escargot sat in was much more than just melted butter.  If I attempted to describe it I wouldn't be able to do it justice.  Another wonderful array of flavors.    

I was encouraged to order the crème brulée, which I was informed has been on the menu for years and is extremely unique.  It had wonderful vanillas flavors and a perfect consistency.  I'm excited to try an assortment of in-house made gelatos and sorbets next time...

Incredible fresh-baked breads.  The bread-server was a little surprised, and then compassionate, when I asked for a sampling of every kind of bread offered!  

If you're celebrating or you merely make dining an important part of your life - oh, and if you love Vegas - Le Cirque needs to be put on your must-go list.",5dYduxPNouuR5SI3V1OtCw,3,3,5,v3ZqaYGXQrBClpOUIktaZw

4094638,2014-04-03,2,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I came in on Christmas Day and had the Christmas Tasting menu. 

It was a great experience, especially when it is to celebrate the most important birthday of the year... Jesus. Kidding aside, we were really there for a birthday. 

For this holiday, you can only order the tasting menu. There was a choice for each course, even the amuse bouche. 

Here is what I had and ordered: 
The breads were ok, as they were not warmed and actually tasted stale. We had a late reservation, but that's no excuse in any restaurant. 

The amuse bouche was Panko Crusted Farm Egg with Caviar. This was wonderful because I love egg based dishes and how can it not be better with a dollop of caviar. Oh and yes, the egg yolk was nice and slightly runny. 

The first course was Maple and Balsamic Glazed Foie Gras. This is a dish that a French restaurant should have perfected and indeed, it was seared wonderfully which made the foie creamy and buttery with a firm outside layer. The addition of the maple glaze and balsamic added the sweetness and the acid to balance the gras. 

The second course was the Wild Atlantic Turbot with Truffle Puree, and Black Trumpet mushrooms. This was a good dish albeit petite. The best combination was to put a dab of truffle puree with the fish. With just the fish or the puree by itself, it would have been lacking. 

The third course, the main course, was Braised Veal Cheeks. Who knew Veal cheeks were so big? Just kidding, they were a good size and reminded me of braised short rib but more tender. What really took this to the next level was the red wine reduction and black truffles. 

For all the dishes thus far, it's not about the main ingredient, it's about how all the ingredients on  the plate pair and compliment each other. There is a harmonious togetherness that each of the dishes had, which a lot of other restaurant have a hard time finding. 
 
Dessert - souffle
It's a 5 star French restaurant. They better get this right and right they did. I wonder if they would just let people come in for their souffle.... because I would be there every week. Um, just the souffle, not the tasting ;)

To conclude, if you like the more traditional French Fine dining experience, I highly recommend Le Cirque. 

Note: The only downside about the restaurant is that the tables are way too close to one another. You can literally hear the next table's conversation.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,4,2,4,XzWx8VQ685GZSwNxpAKyWg

The time between courses (tasting menu) was inconsistent, with some long waits. We did not get what we paid for by far. Had we known this going in, we would have gone elsewhere. The best item was the souffle, everything else did not live up to the reputation of Le Cirque. We will never come back. Overpriced and underwhelmed.

I get that things need to be cooked to order, but some attentiveness in between or acknowledgment that it had taken over 30 minutes for us to get from the first course to the next one would have been nice. 

Also, I felt like I was sitting in the lap of one of the people in the table next to me. We basically had to maneuver our table in order to go to the bahtroom and I'm a small person -- I cannot imagine what someone of normal height would have to do. It's also not as if we were a surprise guest -- I made my reservations well in advance. 

Thanks to the food, both of these issues were very much overshadowed.  

Our meals began with their squash soup shooter and bread amuse bouche. Both were great. Then came the bread platter. Amazing. Between my boyfriend and I we tried all of them, our favorites being the bacon one (bacon!!!) and the lemon/rosemary one. 

For my first course I had their seared foie dish. It was superb. Su-perb. The boy got the fruit de mer bowl and all in all it was good but not impressive since we hail from the land of seafood. The highlight of it though was the tuna in the middle. It melted in your mouth.

My main course was the duck. That was also great. Well seasoned and the confit of some of the leftovers that they gave me was also very good. My boyfriend's rabbit was also very well done. He had never had rabbit before and enjoyed it quite a bit.

By the time dessert arrived, we were both sufficiently stuffed. I ordered the chocolate souffle and it was everything I had hoped for. Rich. Creamy in the middle. Delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Sphere which was not only rich and tasty but also really cool to watch as they poured the sauce over it.

I really like the petit fours at the end but they seemed a bit overkill given how rich everything else was. The mini jewelry box with truffles was also a nice added touch.",E23K7p3-V_kxsc0fhpEqNA,0,0,4,1TBgBzcy6ZXXdbZLEoqBPQ
4104380,2016-11-21,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Wow.  I don't know how I had never been here.  It's been here since Bellagio opened.  I think it's my favorite French restaurant in Vegas.  And I really enjoyed it, and I don't love Frensh restaurants.

It's 5 star service, with 5 star food, overall just a 5 star experience!

It's tiny inside so make reservations and don't expect a huge interior.  All the tables are very close together.

ALBA WHITE TRUFFLE MENU: wow.  Incredible.  You can choose from 3 courses up to 8+ courses, and the price varies based on that.  My favorite was the Tagliatelle with truffles.  Simple and well done.  All of the courses are small but since they are all rich, 3 courses feels like plenty.  The quail was also incredible - super tender and rich.  The foie was a little much but hey why not.  The veal was very tender and tasty too.  The rabbit is their signature but honestly it was a little too heavy for me by the end.  I wish the rabbit dish was a little lighter but it was nonetheless tasty.  

CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: incredible.  perfectly cooked. heavenly.  Maybe my favorite chocolate souffle I've had in a while.  And also I was so happy they had a chocolate souffle.  So many places are trying all these flavored souffles but really, it's a souffle.  Keep it classy Souffles!

Fresh juices: Ok, you probably don't come here to drink fresh juices but they make an incredible passion fruit and mango juice cocktail.  A piece of paradise in a french restaurant sitting in Vegas.

If you want something served to you that doesn't look like what you expect, try the tartare and beef tendon ""souffle"".  It will not be what you think.  It is one of the most interesting presentations of what someone nicknamed ""chips and dip""...

Service is incredible.  Super friendly, with a dry French humor, and seems super authentic.  All our services spoke French I think.

Windows look out at the fountains and at Paris' Eiffel Tower.

They have their own bathrooms inside of the restaurant so you don't have to go into the casino!

People dress up but you don't have to if you didn't bring a suit or coat to Vegas, or if you just don't want to carry your coat after dinner...

The entrance is closer to the North Valet entrance, so if you're coming from somewhere else, get dropped off there and head in so you can avoid the crowd of the main entrance and having to walk all through the casino.",JLZs2s5Z6AtvE6Ry2AovTg,0,0,5,ZT9ChmsaieiiW7SYviVrmw
4115586,2010-04-16,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"With Le Cirque's reputation (and many, many fabulous reviews), I had high expectations... and some of my expectations were met. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, the food was beyond disgusting. I consider myself somewhat adventurous when it comes to food, so it's not like I disliked it because of inexperience. 

Again, because of the number of raving reviews on the lobster salad, I figured there was no question as to what I was ordering for my appetizer. It was ok. I had a lobster salad at Fleur de Lys the night before that was easily 10 times better. 

My husband ordered the quail for his appetizer, which was good... but not anything to write home about. The truffle sauce they served with it, though, was delicious. Also, I'm usually not one to complain about small portions, as some of my favorite restaurants have small portions, but the quail was ridiculous. It was so tiny, it might as well have been an amuse bouche. 

I ordered the lobster with king crab ravioli for my entree... this is the reason I am giving one star. If I could give zero stars, I would. The lobster was so incredibly rubbery and tough, I could barely cut through it with my knife. It also had such a horribly fishy taste that I only ate one bite. I decided to take a bite of my ravioli (even though the dough was dyed with squid ink, which I was already nervous about), and it was even worse than the lobster. I couldn't bring myself to swallow it on my first try, so I tried drinking some water with it. It took 4 tries to finally get it down because the taste was so awful. Immediately, I felt a strange pain in my throat and had the urge to throw up right at the table multiple times. I would have much preferred grabbing a big mac and fries from McDonald's. Seriously. 

My husband ordered the rabbit. Also just ""good"". 

I have been quite sick for ~5 days now and my doctor told me I probably have food poisoning. Needless to say, I will never go to Le Cirque again... even if someone paid me. Fleur de Lys at Mandalay (Huber Keller's restaurant) is a much better choice if you want fine French food in Vegas. In fact, it was one of the best meals I've had in my life.

I had a wonderful dinner when Marc Poidevin was the chef. I had another wonderful dinner with Wilfred Bergerhausen heading the kitchen. Regardless of who is in the kitchen, sticking with the signature Le Cirque dishes ensures a memorable evening.

The specialty cocktails were all martinis in outrageously tall glasses. Like most martinis, they weren't particularly unique like the ""Deja vu"" with Hendrick's gin, muddled cucumbers, and St. Germain which felt like déjà vu because I've had this combination before at other bars. Despite the common cocktails, the show began with the amuse of smoked salmon on a smoldering bed of dry ice.

For appetizers, the lightly seared whole foie gras was big and rare. The lightest Thai flavors were creatively used to counter the fatty foie. The frog lollipops starter had cute leg bones used as the lollipop sticks. Acid from the mild béarnaise wisely balanced the fry coating on the frog meat ball. For added decadence, sautéed fiddleheads, whole morels, and white asparagus were added.

For entrees, the ""Rabbit Symphony"" was a duo of tender roulade and braised meat. The fried spaetzle added textural crunch and a buttery sauce tied everything together. The potato crusted fish was an upscale presentation of fish, chips, and slaw. The potato crust was thinner than expected which only made the dish more elegant along with increasing the scale of difficulty because it must be challenging to both cook the potato and fish at the same rate. It was also daring to use a red wine sauce with the moist bass.

The signature ""Chocolate Ball"" dessert was another showy dish as the hot chocolate sauce made the chocolate ball shell vanish. It was more showmanship than tasty as it would have been better with a darker chocolate sauce. Ultimately, it was too much like a chocolate sundae. The raspberry soufflé had incredible height and a perfectly browned top. Again, the faultless execution topped the taste.

The wine pairings were on the mark except when both entrees were served with a Bethel Heights, Willamette Valley, Pinot Noir which smelled wonderful, but laid a little flat with the food.

Although jackets are recommended, it's Vegas and they'll seat any true high roller in just about any attire.",yz0s55qwi_WqVjmbyZ9ICw,2,1,5,0XXnGHVqZmOd7Yk8zssqlA

1) Menu is very truffle-heavy. I didn't opt for the truffle-themed menu, and it still felt like every other course had truffles. The truffles were great, and they belonged in the dishes, but it felt repetitive.

2) For a $400 dinner, I want bigger portions. I know I sound like a pleb saying that, but some dishes are just sparse. The black bass was literally 2""x1"". Take one bite, decide you like it, take another bite... and it's gone. I'm not looking for gigantic portions, but the entrees border dangerously close to hors d'oeuvres.

4218119,2015-03-05,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Third time at Le Cirque- twice in nyc and first time in Vegas. I was always super satisfied and happy about my experiences at Le Cirque.

Tonight I went with my husband, his cousin, and his aunt and we all enjoyed everything we had there. The ambiance is very special and the staff is wonderful. I really am impressed with the service at the Vegas location (nyc was very good as well)!

The portions were large but not overwhelming and of course everything was delicious. 

This is what we ordered:

Appetizer: foie gras (2), lobster risotto, lobster and avocado salad.

Main: rabbit, duck for two, and sea bass.

Dessert: raspberry parfait, mascarpone and chestnut mousse, creme brulee, and sesame panna cotta.

I got to try a bite of everyone's food (haha don't judge...) and my favorites were the lobster risotto, duck, and creme brulee. 

They even gave us a small platter of mini desserts on the house and small boxes of chocolate for the ladies at the table. So cute!

4225311,2017-06-14,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"We were pretty disappointed with what we were hoping was going to be a memorable dinner and ended up feeling like pretty poor value for the money.  Let me begin with the good: we each had a curious George cocktail, and it was the be best cocktail we ever had.  They yellowtail was also exquisite - fresh and buttery. The breads, the butter, the little details were all great.  Now for the bad: first, the degustation menu ($138 per person for 5 courses) does not allow for a couple to order a separate dish for each course without at least one person having to pay a ""supplement,"" which is anywhere from $40-$70 dollars.  For us, this meant that we had to order two of the same plates for two courses, but we ended up paying for one supplement, just to try something different.  This took a lot of the fun out of the menu, because it suddenly shot up to $200 for one person for one different small dish.  Second, the seared foie gras was simply worse than any foie gras I have ever had - it had a strong, musty smell, and was cold and curdled in the middle.  The main course (we were stuck with chicken because the other option besides the sea bass - which we had already ordered -- required a big $$ supplement), was really mediocre.  It was a lump of tepid chicken breast with gooey skin and gravy on top.  There was nothing spectacular about it, and it was so overdone that it could not compare to a good roast chicken salted early at a home kitchen.  The service was good, but the waiters would zoom by and say, """"how is everything, delicious?"" and when we would not answer, they would zoom away.  Not sure what they could have done, but the food just was not as good as it should have been for the amount of $$, nor was it particularly interesting.  $500 for this meal felt like a pretty serious rip off when compared to some of the other restaurants we enjoyed in Vegas for a quarter of the price.",Wa_kb1pA45mW81IleqYjuA,1,0,2,fq8K8CJL3MExsJslQ761ZA

That's probably the best way I can describe my recent visit to Le Cirque but I would say the food was pretty darn good too. We chose this place for our last night in Las Vegas, a pre-cursor to the famous O show at the Bellagio hotel. After catching the spectacular and dazzling water fountain show, we made our way inside. The decor is eclectic, imagine a heavily French circus with cute little monkeys printed on the plates. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly, offering recommendations and even accommodating our dietary needs (no pork or alcohol). Husband ordered off the Dégustation Menu (5 course), I order A La Carte (3 course). Honestly between his choices and mine plus the free chestnut soup, amuse bouche and pre desserts, I counted about 10 different courses (example of good service: for every dish where he got one and I didn't they placed an extra plate besides me so we could share!). And the desserts, don't even get me started on the desserts. Pure chocolate heaven. And pre dessert I mentioned? Lemon sorbet with Pop Rocks. Pop Rocks! At a 5 diamond star restaurant. Simply brilliant. They were also really good with timing and mindful of our theatre tickets so everything came out at a good pace. Overall a wonderful experience, yes it's pricey but once in awhile you gotta splurge on yourself.

4286048,2015-04-13,2,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque is a modern American dining experience in the Bellagio that fits the bill in terms of the decor/service but the taste itself is a bit more tougher to distinguish.  

To find Le Cirque, first, go towards the back of Bellagio when entering from the main entrance past many of the restaurants.  Signs will start appearing about halfway in.  

The decor of Le Cirque is intimate and cozy.  Not a big fan of the old circus paintings and the colors personally but you do get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains from here.  

Service here is outstanding all-around.  Great stories from the waiters; explanations of all the dishes; constant checks of water to supplies.  No problems.  

The menu is a prix-fixe menu of different sorts (most of them are +$100).  A few of the options also have extra costs affixed.  The one I chose was with an appetizer/entree/dessert.  They also have a cocktail menu (and wine/beer) ranging from $16+.  For the cocktail, I received the deja vu which is gin with cucumber flavors - pretty good and love the presentation/cocktail shaker. You also get bread (lots of flavors) and salted/unsalted butter.  We also got a seafood amuse-bouche which was pretty interesting and even had some gold on it.  

For the appetizer, I got the risotto which came with lobster.  It was pretty good although the texture was a little strange with the nuts and fruit-like food involved.  I then got the sea bass which came in an egg roll shape.  I thought the presentation was interesting but the taste was fairly not that special here with the salty/vinegar-y sauce and the egg roll style dominating the flavors too much.  Finally, I got the pistachio dessert - the bar which wasn't too shabby with good flavor profiles.  The included buttermilk ice cream though was tasteless in my experience.  We also got some small desserts for free but I was told the flavors weren't that special here.  Most of these dishes had that similar deconstructed feel as well which all looked interesting/cool but the flavors always were a bit all over the [lace.  

Le Cirque isn't bad by any means in terms of the quality of service or experience.  Just the food I felt wasn't completely connecting taste-wise with the creativity behind the dishes.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,3,3,3,N2oxAxnxn3P37SI-pUZobg

I found Le Cirque, as most great discoveries go, by complete accident. First, they have amazing service. At 10:10, they re-opened their kitchen to accommodate my late arrival and promptly whisked me off to a well appointed table adorned with fine sliver and roses.

A meticulously paced stream of staff brought my martini and selection of savory breads (the bacon roll and thyme roll really are amazing). Always off the beaten path, I dismissed the prix fix out of hand and set about ordering. I invited a few staff to my table to quietly debate their favorites, what was new, freshly in season and landed on two of their more simple dishes, the signature Lobster Salad and Poulet Rôti Contiser à la Truffe Noir (Organic Roasted Chicken, Black Truffle, Macaroni au Foie Gras). 

A stocky member of the staff with slicked black hair and the air of self importance shuffled over to my table, declaring himself the sommelier. I shared my order with him and offered that a bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay might be just the thing to pair with both dishes. Casually intrigued, his eyes searched the horizon for a moment then refocused with resolve. He smoothly made a counter recommendation, assessing me with arched brow. I smiled and slowly handed him the wine menu with, ""I am in your hands.""

The Sauvignon Blanc (Domaine Girard's 2008 Sancerre La Garenne) arrived with the salad, an impeccable combination. The wine's crisp fresh notes and effervescent mouth feel were counterpoints to the richness of the lobster and peppery greens. The Chardonnay (2007 Husic from Napa Valley) had hints of oak and leather that seemed to embolden the seductive tones of the black truffle, sinfully appointed macaroni and lightly broiled chicken.

The off menu dessert recommended by the staff was a triumph of a raspberry candied basket nested with poached peach, crème fraiche, almond slivers and made popping sounds like fireworks. My desert had pop-fizzy candy in it!! That sealed my crush on Le Cirque.

Each dish left me wanting more while feeling completely satisfied and well rewarded for visiting.

My husband and I had only 48 hours in Vegas and the only place we crossed our fingers and toes on getting a reso was for dinner at Le Cirque and lucky us, we got one on the evening before we left the city.  We both chose the 3 course prix fixe menu.  Portions were perfect and all guests were surprised with a beautiful complimentary amuse bouche of a citrus foam inside the shell of an egg atop a slight sweetened carrot puree, cucumber and was it coriander or cilantro? Delicious! Looked intimidating at first as i was expecting a gooey texture but this was the perfect way to start the meal.  Our first courses came:  I had the Japanese yellowtail with hearts of palm, avocado mousse and yuzu vinaigrette.  My better half had the fois gras...omg soooo decadent and delicious!  For mains we had a seabass wrapped on potato on a bed of leeks and also the lamb three ways with thumbelina carrots.  All the plating looked like they used kitchen tweezers and placed every ingredient on there with love.  You can taste the love they put in the food here!  Palette cleanser came in a beautiful gold pineapple with ice and two little spheres that looked like truffles. We popped it in our mouths to experience a refreshing pineapple lavender shot to prepare us for our decadent desserts.  We had a chocolate souffle with a vanilla bean ice cream as well as a chocolate ball with ice cream that tasted like a ferrero rocher...so good.  The service...so refreshing to be in the food industry and not be disappointed with service.  We toasted quietly to our anniversary 'plus one month...plus a couple of days' at the beginning of the meal and when our desserts landed we were blown away.  Our desserts each had a little plaque that said Happy Anniversary, not only that but we were astonished by the waiter wishing us...and i quote 'happy anniversary...plus one month...plus a couple of days!' When he placed the desserts down.  One may call it eavesdropping but i was super impressed.   So impressed i wanted to whisper 'this food is terrible' and see if every wait staff turns around.

My husband and I decided to splurge on one good dinner during our recent stay in Vegas.  It was hard narrowing it down with so many great choices but after reading several yelp reviews and recommendations from foodies, we made reservations at Le Cirque.  
The service here is impeccable.  Everyone made us feel so welcome in such a genuine way.  Our glasses were never empty and the waiters were good about picking up our empty plates when we both were done- as to not rush us as is the case when one person finishes and the waiters take their plate right away.  The sommelier was so nice to us when we wanted a bottle of wine to pair well with both of our dishes.  He did not snub us when we told him our price range or that we weren't too big of a wine drinkers.  He gave us great recommendations and we ended up with a nice Sauvignon Blanc that is now my husband's favorite wine.
The waiters seemed very genuine too- made lots of small talk asking where we were from and talking about good eats in Chicago.

We did the tasting menu and every dish was awesome.  Usually when you do a tasting, there's a few dishes that you could do without, but every dish was ""lick your plate clean"" worthy.  Husband and I usually trade plates half-way through the dish, and we both struggled to give up our plates but were glad when we did because the other plate was just as good.  I don't think I could even pick a favorite dish because every dish was great.  One that I was borderline about was the sea urchin ice cream.  The first 2 tastes were really good, but after awhile it was too rich.  Since i traded halfway, it was a good dish that wasn't overpowering.  My husband LOVED the foie gras and duck dishes.

So we decided to go back for the second time tonight.  It was better than the first time.  Martin, our waiter is the best waiter we have ever met in all the years of dining from fast food to fine dining.  He went above and beyond his duty. Told us stories, made us laugh and was an all around an amazing human being.  Of course everyone here is amazing but Martin was an exception.  

We look forward to come here everytime we comr to Vegas.  Thank you for making our dinner amazing.",aHj0ZIZCK_pL16Jf3ayubA,1,0,5,u_POXy2RdX8y3WZasq94Kg

Just irresponsible and want to experience the finer things in life that you can't afford?  Well if any of these is the case, why not enjoy a nice dinner at a Michelin Star rated restaurant in the Bellagio.  

As you can imagine, service was over the top fantastic.  We probably had 7 people serving us.  One was an expert on the bread, there's a sommelier for the wine, a food guy, etc.  You get my point.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  

Ok ok, I'll get to the good stuff.....THE FOOD!  We did the chef's tasting menu and EVERYTHING was delicious.  We YOLO'd and added the A5 Kobe Japanese Waygu beef.....BEST DECISION we made in Vegas that weekend.  I've been lucky enough to have it a few times at other places and this was ONE OF THE BEST!   Overall for the quality of the food, taste, and presentation it was worth the price.  Just be careful if you're a drinker, the bill could add up pretty fast (see photos).

Speaking of drinks, they have a great wine selection and really unique and creative cocktails.

The beauty and of Le Cirque's interior will take you on a magic carpet ride away from the stresses and problems that exist on the exterior of our complicated world. 

The decor is only the beginning of this extraordinary experience, as the beautiful plate ware and glassware play their part in this superb performance de cuisine. 

You'll quickly notice the beauty is not only on the walls (and the ceiling), the food in front of you is a gorgeous work of art. It's been a while since my lady and I dined here, but I remember we were simply taken into a whole new world. Aromas, textures, colors, memories, and emotions explode from every dish. We had an unforgettable experience at Le Cirque. 

A large part of this had to do with our server, a charming young man who truly understands his trade. He complemented the both of us immediately on our appearance, very thoughtful. He was perfect at answering any questions we had, providing recommendations when we asked about aperitifs and menu inquiries, and he knew how to treat people of our age (early 20's *at the time*) in this environment. 

We've been offended a couple times by pompous and ungrateful attitudes from career servers at high-end establishments. I feel obligated to mention, we're not a complicated pair (with our food that is!) and we don't order light. 

Our server, clearly understood this. He was entertaining, humorous, and respectful/appreciative/professional in relation to our total experience. He really made the evening splendid for the both of us. He even gave my girlfriend a Le Cirque purse holder, probably standard, but very cool never the less.

Amuse Bouche:
Foie gras soufflé with an edible marigold flower. I specifically came to Le Cirque to try foie gras for the first time so I was excited that it was the very first course. It was amazing! 

Appetizer:
Sautéed foie gras with this light puff pastry bread with pears. Easily the most delicious thing I've ever put in my mouth and would return just for that dish. My friend got the lobster risotto which was cooked perfectly and had a bit of spice. Also delicious. 

Dinner:
Milk fed veal with the crispest asparagus tips I've ever had and black pepper mashed potatoes. I ordered my veal medium rare and my friend ordered hers rare and both came out cooked perfectly. Perfect portion sizes and just delicious. 

Dessert: 
I had the Tahitian vanilla bean creme brûlée. It was easily the best creme brûlée I've ever had but the Tahitian vanilla didn't really taste different from any other vanilla. Just my opinion. My friend had some fruit sorbet cream thing that came out in an ice bowl so the presentation was much nicer than the actual taste. 

It's a once in a lifetime experience that I highly recommend for everyone who has $300 to throw away on a meal. I'm a total foodie and will remember this meal for the rest of my life.",q8UfnNs9NsbcT8uLoBwbjQ,5,5,5,UiKcvmLfKTrLf8uTINxdvA

I expected a much bigger and intimidating restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by how small and cosy the restaurant is. It felt very comfortable being in there.

The service was top notch...we had a designated waiter but the rest of the staff kept an eye on us and to make sure that all our requests were met and not delayed when our waiter was attending to somebody else. Great teamwork!

The food was amazing as well. I had escargot as my appetizer and my husband had langoustine with the top of caviar. I would go back there just for these two dishes. 

I had the turbot and my husband had the lobster. The turbot was good...not exceptional, the lobster was very good. 

We had the Grand Marnier  soufflé for desert and coffee. The soufflé was too sweet for our taste but held its shape and was very nice overall.

I would go back most definitely for their tasting menu given they add escargot and langoustine to it.

4472885,2017-09-24,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"""We'll always have a table for you at Le Cirque"" was the parting words from our fantastic meal.  Honestly, the chocolate coffee bread could have elevated this place to a five out of five stars.  When they offer it to you, take it!  The service was different than any other place I've been to.  It was top notch, but there was an extra factor of personality that you just don't get everywhere.  I feel I have had better service at a few other places, but those establishments had people just standing around scanning the dining room to see where they can assist.  Le Cirque was still very attentive and would be considered some of the best service if they weren't personable.  But they were...  They were all so friendly on a personalized level and I think that elevates this service above anywhere else.  We were asked to have our photo taken with our own camera so many times.  They offered, we didn't have to ask.  That just makes my wife's life so much easier.  She also tested them with this by having five thousand, three hundred and twenty-seven photos taken of us there.  When the artwork that they said was edible food was presented, we were advised to have our video camera out if we want to capture the presentation.  

Every single serving of food was explained in great detail.  I heard the sommelier explain the wines to every table.  We talked to the table next to us about the meal and watched as other people ordered amazing dishes.  

Lastly, I'm a big fan of ginger, so I love mule drinks.  Their mule drink had so much incredible flavor.  It was the best mule I've ever had.  The drinking vessel was this heavy copper pineapple cup, with a macaron on top of the pineapple lid.  

I have only been to Las Vegas a few times, so I would rather try different places than attend the same place again.  It seems unlikely that I would return in my lifetime, but the experience was so extremely positive, that I would highly consider returning on a future visit.  I feel that speaks volumes to the experience we had.  

Also, the chef signed the menu for us as an anniversary present.  We were also provided with some takeaway truffles too.  Thank you for such a personalized meal!",eFUcc2QbaW0InWgsBsMiwA,2,3,5,mxCtESAMAf_wh4aEiOgQYA

I wanted to experience the satisfaction of watching delicious, warm chocolate being poured over a chocolate ball covering ice cream. We had dinner reservations at CUT at 10 and Le Cirque was closing at 11 so we knew there was no way we could have dessert after dinner. My boyfriend, who so kindly supports my food adventures, agreed to run around Vegas so I can get my dessert before dinner. 

We got to Bellagio at 9:00 PM, ran to the restaurant and asked for a seat at the bar (highly recommended). The bartender (who's name I can't seem to remember) was a sweet, feisty woman with a lot of character. She was entertaining and welcoming and completely understood my visit to the restaurant for the chocolate ball (no judgement). She first gave us these little cold fruity dessert balls which explode in your mouth. Then I finally got to try my chocolate ball! And yes it was satisfying. She also gave us truffles in a keepsake box which was so sweet! I felt so excited! Like a little kid at Toys'R us (if you read this review years from now, Toys'R us was the store amazon ran out of business.

4498355,2016-01-22,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque definitely gives you one of the best dining experiences you can ever get.  Mind you, I said experiences, not just food and not just service because both are phenomenal.  I have also had my fair share of Michelin star restaurants, and this one is a winner in my book.  The first time I had it, I was with a group of 4 and we were enjoying each other's company but what stood out for me was the fact that I never noticed when they had refilled my water.  The second time I came back, we had a very intriguing conversation with the waiter about some of the people who come through the restaurant and we continued conversing with him even more after that.  You definitely will not get any type of service where they can give you so much.

That first part was just about the service alone and that was one of the best experiences, so let me get started on the food.  It is French food with very good combinations of tastes that melt together and complement each other well.  I have had the foie gras twice and have enjoyed it and have enjoyed the scallops.  I have tried many French restaurants outside of Le Cirque and have had the enjoyment of dining in France and Le Cirque is one of the places in the US that makes me reminisce about eating there.

The thing that hit home for me, given my sweet tooth, partially because of innovation and being one of the few places I found it, is the Boule de Chocolat (Ball of Chocolate), where they pour heated milk chocolate to melt a ball of dark chocolate hiding a hazelnut crunch and white chocolate ice cream.

My previous best meal EVER was at SPAGO Beverly Hills, but this exceeded that in both food and service quality.  Compared to Picasso, Michael Mina, Bradley Ogden (no longer at Caesar's?), Mesa Grill, Fleur, Le Cirque bested them all in food quality, taste, and service.

My wife and I both tried selections from the Degustation Menu (5 courses) and they did not disappoint.  Foie Gras and burgundy escargot were delicious.  Lobster salad was better than Spago's - much more lobster in the salad.  Sea food selections - sea bass and scallop - were dead on delicious.  I had experienced very ""gamey"" venison at other places (Picasso, for one) but this was gratifying.  Since it was the end of the seasonal menu, the chef included black truffles onto my wife's organic chicken, which was super succulent and juicy.  Only problem - we didn't have enough room to finish our desserts.  Chocolate sphere and chocolate soufflé.  Both rich and devilishly smooth, but not overly sweet.  We really were treated to the quality of the chocolate, and not a huge sugar-rush taste.

Everyone involved with the service was fantastic, from the lead waiter to the support staff.  They were fun, charming, yet sophisticated while warm.  My wife and I felt like they really wanted you to enjoy the dining experience.",v7dX7v1NQBapLlguguOuvA,3,1,5,wphwBlBOZeNQzucXwa4Muw
4513599,2017-09-06,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I was incredibly excited to eat here during a recent trip to Las Vegas. We reserved a table for 4 at 7pm, and were seated promptly. The dining room is gorgeous. 

We were offered and ordered a pre-meal cocktail. 
At that time we met the staff and were asked if we had a show that evening. We said no, that dinner was the highlight of the evening. 

Shortly after we ordered our cocktails we placed our orders. I was a bit surprised they did not offer to explain anything on the menu; however we were discussing the Tasting Menu so I assume they knew we already wanted that. We placed our orders and before we could finish our cocktails the first course was at the table. The Sommelier arrived, who was funny and cordial, to describe the first wine. The first course was yellowtail, and delicious, my husband got the crab which was divine. As soon as we finished the food it was cleared and nearly as quickly they brought the glasses for the next course. Again, I was surprised because we all still had half our pre dinner cocktail and at least half of the first glass of wine. The second course came, amazing risotto, and the speediness repeatedly itself again. Finally, my husband asked them to slow down because the course were coming so fast we were barely able finish our previous course and unable to finish our drinks. The waiter apologized and mentioned they were used to getting people to shows. We stated again we didn't have a show. He said he would take cues from my husband. At this point, the service switched, the sommelier came out for 2nd wine, but not the 3rd and despite my husband trying to signal the waiter repeatedly it took 3-4 attempts (understandably he had other tables) to catch his attention so it took almost 3.5 more hours to complete our remaining courses. 

Overall the food was wonderful, I particularly loved my potato wrapped sea bass and soufflé, but the pace of service was stressful and detracted from the experience.",CuiVTD61-mAXqY-nAMfAWQ,0,0,4,tKE_Oj-wxstMDv14RGDnKQ

However, if you come between 5-5:45pm on most nights (except holidays), you can do their pre-theater menu, which is a more limited 3 course menu for $72. We opted to do the pre-theater menu. 

We received the following:
Bread basket: amazing. There were lots of delicious types of bread inside, including a white chocolate coffee tea bread (so sweet, almost like dessert!), a bacon roll, and a salted pretzel. The bread also came with salted and unsalted butter. Smoked salmon topped with panna cotta mousse, gold leaf, and caviar amuse bouche: a delicious start to the meal. The smoked salmon was flavorful and the panna cotta was deliciously creamy. The amuse bouche was served on top of rocks with dry ice, which created a cool smoky effect.
Steak tartare with quail egg and herb salad appetizer: the steak tartare was fresh and high quality, and I enjoyed being able to pour the raw quail egg whites and yolk out of the tiny shell and onto the steak tartare to give an added creaminess.
Lobster and Parmesan risotto appetizer: I liked this a bit less than the steak tartare, but the risotto was well-cooked and had a strong lobster and Parmesan flavor. 
Salmon entree with asparagus and potato mouselline: I thought the salmon was a bit overcooked and therefore not as tender. Portion size was generous for an upscale restaurant. 
Chicken entree with asparagus, mushrooms, roasted baby potatoes, and sauce vin jaune: the chicken was tender and juicy, and the sauce was thick, dense, and flavorful. 
Sea bass with crispy potatoes, braised leeks, and Pinot noir reduction: I didn't try this, but my friends who ordered it said it was the best sea bass they have had, and their favorite entree. The basil and the Pinot noir reduction paired together in an unexpectedly creative but delicious manner. 
Chocolate ball dessert with praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, hazelnut caramel crunch, and chocolate sauce: this was an amazing dessert! The chocolate ball is decently sized and the server pours hot chocolate sauce on top, which melts the outer chocolate shell and reveals the ice cream and praline mousse inside. The dessert tastes like a gigantic Ferrero Rocher!
Raspberry parfait, champagne gelee, lychee dessert: another amazing dessert. The acidic raspberries paired perfectly with the sweetness of the parfait and the lychee. 

Service was amazing. Our waters were constantly refilled and our silverware replaced. At the end of the meal, we were given complimentary macarons and truffles, which were the perfect sweet treat to end the meal.

4593221,2014-05-13,5,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque in the Bellagio has the formula for a perfect restaurant figured out -- gorgeous ambiance and Michelin-grade cuisine, coupled with a fun vibe and none of the stuffiness or pretentiousness that I typically associate with Vegas fine dining.

I was flying solo on a Friday night, so I dropped by Le Cirque since I had read on Yelp that it was very solo-diner-friendly.  Even though I had made a reservation just to be safe, I found it to be unnecessary since I was able to settle into the cozy bar and enjoy the full dinner service there.  It was also a good vantage point from which to enjoy the vintage-circus-themed murals and carnival tent decor.  

The whole night, I was taken care of by the bartender, Gene.  He started me off with a ""déjà vu"" cocktail (gin, St. Germain, cucumber puree), and a few slices of complementary (and dangerously addictive) walnut chocolate bread.  It was served in a stunning long-stemmed martini glass and tasted delicious.  Gene was friendly and chatty, and made me feel very comfortable and welcome as a solo diner.

I'm a believer in ""go big or go home"", so I opted for Le Cirque's multi-course degustation menu.   Although Le Cirque bills itself as French restaurant, the dishes feature flavors culled from all over the place.  Here's the list of what I tasted:

AMUSE BOUCHE -- minced cucumber with hibiscus foam.

COURSE #1 -- Scottish salmon gravlax with quail egg, pickled onion, baby radish, blini, lemon creme fraiche, and salmon caviar

COURSE #2 -- sauteed foie gras, kumquats, baby turnips, and pomegranate reduction

COURSE #3 -- potato-crusted Mediterranean sea bass with braised leeks and Pinot noir wine reduction

COURSE #4 -- espelette-crusted Colorado lamb chop with couscous, baby zucchini, turnips, tomato confit, and navarin

PRE-DESSERT -- tequila sorbet with grapefruit shaved ice and Pop Rocks

DESSERT --  chocolate ball with praline mousse, white chocolate ice cream, and hazelnut caramel

PETIT FOURS -- an assortment of four small pastries

Every bite of this meal was perfection.  Picking out a favorite or best would be impossible.  I loved it all.  In terms of sheer visual appeal, the gravlax was a work of art on a plate.  In terms of indulgence, the foie gras wins hands down.  In terms of elevating a simple concept into something extraordinary, the winner would be the sea bass and leeks.  In terms of dinner-as-performance, the chocolate ball deserves kudos, since it's an incredible sight to behold to watch the a perfect chocolate sphere dissolve in front of your very eyes, revealing the ice cream inside.

An unexpected treat was receiving a small gilded box with two additional petit fours as a goodbye gift.  Another nice touch was receiving an email from the G.M. the next day thanking me for my patronage.

For apps I had the Escargot which was prepared out of the shell.  The garlic butter sauce was bland and the snails were chewy and overdone.  The croutons were served mixed into the dish which in turn made them mushy.  Had to be the worst preparation of Escargot I've ever eaten.  For my main dish I had the Atlantic Cod.  The fish was fine.... BORING.........  Yes, of course the size of the main course would have left a baby starving but that's not my beef.  It's that it lacked any creativity or flavor.  Same went for dessert.  I had the Chocolate Souffle.  This souffle compared to Bottega Louie's is like comparing Boones Farm to Chateau LaTour.

The service was excellent, yes... but the lack of flavor and creativity made this dinner forgettable.

One of the best dining experiences in Vegas! I have been to Craftsteak, L'Atelier, Mesa Grill,  Nobhill, and N9NE but Le Cirque outshone them all with their wonderful service and great food. 

I felt it was a bit stuffy but our group was lively so we made the restaurant work around our mood. :) 

The best part was the fantasy desserts for my friends birthday. The chocolate souffle is a MUST!!!!

Definitely go and you will not be disappointed! :)

The food was as expected from a classy french restaurant. You will not be disappointed. The Foie Gras Saute was delicious as it slowly melted in the mouth. The ""assorted seafood"" entree was typical, nothing too special. However, the desserts were something else. The presentation was spectacular (Had the strawberry sorbet contained in an iceball) and tasted just a little sweet, but you'll still enjoy it because you are in Vegas.

4632538,2012-07-22,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"We had dinner at Le Cirque last night, and let's start off by saying that the food was terrific. The service, well, that's a completely different story.  To recount everything that went wrong would go on too long for anyone to bother to read.  It started out with the two of us being seated squeezed between two tables such that I was bumped into a half dozen times by servers for the next table.  We assumed that there was good reason for this initially, but after a while it was clear there was no good reason why they couldn't have seated us somewhere else.  Then, no one came to even ask if we wanted something to drink before asking for our orders.

We were looking forward to a nice meal, and we both decided to have the degustation menu with wine pairings.  Without running through all six courses, there was at least one significant problem with each course: I was brought the wrong dish for one, my wife was brought the wrong wine for another, etc.  And they could never seem to get the timing of the wine down, with respect to the food.  We went from getting the wine for one course 20 minutes before the food arrived to getting the food before the wine got there at all for the next.  Even when they began to sense that we were getting irritated, it seemed that they were too hopelessly disorganized to be able to get to correct the situation.

It would be nice to able to experience the food at Le Cirque under better circumstances, but I can't imagine going back there any time soon, and I certainly could not recommend it to anyone else.

Addendum:  To their credit, the GM of Le Cirque contacted me to apologize for the bad experience and asked for the opportunity to make it up to us.  No telling when we will be back in Vegas, though.",bB53KUXV-CSD78i4vevgWQ,5,0,2,RKxONAvdbRXL-nKjbMcPpw

We aren't talking polite and attentive wait staff, we are talking truly amazing service. They replace your napkin with a fresh, folded one when you get up to go to the bathroom. Your drinks magically meet you at your table from the bar. They pour all your cocktails right in front of you, even at your table. All this in addition to friendly and attentive wait staff that you would expect.

The reason I'm rating this restaurant 4 instead of 5 stars is honestly because of the food. There were things I tried that were out of this world, and then others that were good but not great. We ate at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant the night before and honestly I felt that I enjoyed the food better there. The one part of the meal that was head and shoulders above anything else we had was dessert. Presentation was outstanding, and it wasn't just about the plating. I ordered the chocolate ball, a seemingly solid and perfectly round chocolate dessert topped with gold leaf. My perfect sphere was then bathed in a rich, hot chocolate sauce, melting away the spherical exterior to reveal still frozen white chocolate ice cream and pralines. Truly spectacular to watch and eat.

Overall, the meal was amazing. Obviously you have to expect to pay an arm and a leg here, so don't even bother on commenting about it being overpriced or not. You pay for the service and ambiance (something not found many other places in Vegas) in addition to the quality food.

4634398,2011-01-03,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Le Cirque offered me one of the WORST experiences in my life.  We had scoped out Vegas for our wedding dinner, and we were trying different restaurants in the area.  One of them was Le Cirque's sister restaurant, Circo, which is also in the Bellagio.

We contacted the new assistant manager (who was in charge of booking their room for wedding dinners), and she reserved our dinner of 4 at Circo.  My fiancee and I went along with our sister and brother-in-law.  The four of us were completely underwhelmed by the meal.  First, there weren't that many people in the restaurant, which made it a bit depressing.  Second, the service was off - I don't know if the wait staff was preoccupied or what, but they were not attentive.  Third, and most importantly, the food was not great.  It was mediocre.  Pasta that was overcooked, entrees bland, and even down to COLD coffee.  

We paid the bill.  And then the new manager came by and asked us what we thought about booking the place for our wedding, and we told her all of our concerns above.  She apologized for Circo's disappointing performance and asked us to come back and try LE CIRQUE.  She said she would set it up and that it would be ""on her,"" i.e., no charge.

We took her up on her offer.  A few nights later, we went back to Le Cirque, but the new manager was not on duty.  No problem, right?  The maitre d' said he had our reservation and that the new manager had told him about us.  Not wanting to be greedy about it, it was just the 2 of us without in-laws.  We sat down and had a pretty good meal, but we noticed the waiters came by and kept pushing add-ons and extras on us.  The sommelier likewise kept passing by and offering us wine after wine.  We wanted to stay sober and judge the food on the merits because this was for our wedding after all.  We had some rabbit ans spaetzel and some other dishes.

HERE'S THE KICKER.  At the end of the meal, the maitre d' came by and put down the folder holding the check.  I thought this was so we could see the total and TIP the waiters.  After all, even though the manager said the meal was ""on her,"" the waiters should still get their tips for serving us.  The waiters were not that great, but we were going to give them 20% anyway.

THE SHOCKER:  We didn't eat that much, but the bill still totaled $430.  I took out $80 for the tip and gave it to the maitre d' and explained again that the manager said the meal was ""on her.""  He said, ""I don't know anything about that.  You have to pay the bill.""  That's when I said, ""Not a chance.""  I told him to call up the manager and confirm.  They made us wait about 10 minutes, and then he returned and said he couldn't find the manager.  The waiter and the maitre d' then attempted to humiliate us in front of everyone else by saying, ""You paid at Circo, right?  So now you pay at Le Cirque.""

I flat out refused and told them I was NOT paying a penny other than the tip.  They were complete a-holes.  My fiancee was so upset that she told me she was going to pay.  I wouldn't let her.  After another 10 minutes of holding us hostage, the maitre d' finally let us leave with dirty looks.  Like we were escaped convicts or something.

I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS POOR TREATMENT ON ANYONE ELSE.

THE EPILOGUE:  We tried e-mailing and calling the manager, and we left her messages telling her what happened and how pissed off we were.  HER RESPONSE:  She sent an e-mail asking if we wanted to book Le Cirque for our wedding dinner.   She's got some nuts, doesn't she?

It's fun to just have a cocktail because the atmosphere and ambience is so fun, with the huge drapery mimicking the circus. 

Bread was not my favorite but not the worst either-- the chocolate coffee is worth trying. The standout dish here that I will always remember is the truffle tagliatelle. There is truffle in the pasta and a LOT more truffle on top. They just come by and start shaving. So decadent! The lobster avocado salad is also outstanding. For the main course, I had the diver scallops which were solid but I felt the potato-crusted sea bass was the better choice. It's such a classic dish but executed so perfectly and really worth your pick. Finally, you can't go wrong with the souffle for dessert, although I am also a panna cotta fan.

Our normal approach is to go for the prix fixe menu but this time we decided to go with the truffle menu.  Wife choose 3 savory courses while I did 4.

The meal started with the amuse bouche which was smoked salmon topped with creme fraiche and caviar.  Excellent start, could really taste the smokiness of the salmon.

My first course was the sunchoke veloutte while the wife had the scrambled eggs.  Both complimented the truffles so well.  There was richness in each of the courses.

From here my wife then had the sunchoke soup while I had the tagliatelle.  The tagliatelle was one of the best past courses I have ever had that wasn't in Italy.  It was perfect cooked pasta with a nice sauce that paired pefectly with the truffles.  This will be a regular choice for me in the future as long as it is on the menu.

We then both had the quail stuffed with foie gras.  This course was good but I think we both went into this dish expecting on of the best things we ever will have eaten.  The quail was cooked pefectly, nice combination of flavors.  It was missing something to put it over the top.  Will say that it was plated with such care.

My final savory course was the rabbit symphony.  This was also amazing.  It was by far the largest sized dish on the truffle menu.  You get multiple pieces of the rabbit so you can see how the chef is able to master a delicate meat.  Not the first time I have gotten this dish nor the last.

Desserts were very good with lots of options.  Wife did a chocolate souffle while I went with the red velvet cake.  

The truffle menu was really good.  All the dishes were in the very good to excellent range.  The amount of truffle you get with each dish is not all that generous so don't expect this to be completely covered with shavings.  That is not surprising given the price isn't that high for this option and it was alba while truffles which are the most expensive truffles in the world.",g-cGhCYwQ0azyPqNBbT1nA,5,2,5,QX9K1EjUzifP2WF-Tl7bng
4703815,2014-11-24,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"I've dined at least a half dozen times at Le Cirque (it is my favorite LV restaurant).  Nothing, however, could have prepared me for THE most luxurious meal I have ever had. The staff, and especially the GM, Ivo Angelov, have always made sure that when I dine at Le Cirque I am treated like a queen. 

When I arrived Tuesday evening, I was again greeted warmly by Ivo. I was led to a corner banquette that would have comfortably seated 4 or 5 people. I told Ivo that I was interested in having some white truffles. I was not given a menu, but started receiving dishes that I would have ordered. Before the parade of luxury, I was presented with a beautiful assortment of breads. I chose the pretzel, the bacon cheddar, and the white chocolate walnut--all were delicious.

My first course was the trio of caviar: smoked salmon rillette wth vodka cream; capellini with poached quail egg, shiso, lemon vinaigrette; kumomoto oyster, Granny Smith Apple, lemon verbena mousse. The dish is presented, and a liquid is poured and smoke rises from the plate (very dramatic!).

Next course was the Fall Salad of baby artichokes, avocado, foie gras snow, jamon iberico, Parmesan, Dijon mustard vinaigrette, and shaved white truffles.

I was thrilled with the next course: gnocchi with white truffles. The best gnocchi anywhere, and with the addition of the white truffles, this dish became my favorite dish of 2014!

Next course was the chilled beet velouté, goat cheese panna cotta, micro greens, and crostini. I'm not a big fan of beets, but this course made me a convert.

This was followed with the seared diver scallop, potato and Apple brunoise, white truffles, celeriac purée, lobster foam, and white chocolate sauce. Didn't think this would all work, but it did beautifully!

My main course was the Japanese A5 Wagyu kobe striploin, bone marrow fondant, spinach purée, beef tendon croquette, royal trumpet mushrooms and bordelaise sauce. Oh yes, more white truffles! I wound up having beef at each of my dinners, but the best was at Le Cirque.

The pre-dessert was a mojito granite with lime foam-very refreshing.

I specifically requested the soufflé for dessert since I have long considered the soufflé at Le Cirque to be the ""gold standard"". The flavor was raspberry-yuzu; I tasted mostly raspberry, and it was delicious!

A tray of mignardises followed, and I ate everyone of them. The last treat was the jewelry box with 2 truffles. I ate only one of them.

Service was, as always, wonderful! It's great to see many of the same staff. Even those staff members not taking care of my table came over to say hello.

When I requested my check, my captain came back with no check, and said my dinner was with the compliments of Le Cirque. I was blown away by such kindness. I left a very generous gratuity for the staff.

Even if I had paid for the dinner, I would still rank it among my top 5 all-time favorite meals.",y6UplUH72gl3eBtG6ACa1w,8,1,5,3khonDde99lKoWnkqOubCA
4709253,2010-05-19,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"How Michelin awarded Le Cirque anything less than 2 stars I'll never know.  While I haven't been to Joel Robuchon (the only 3 star in Vegas), I've been to the other 2 stars and this is at least as good, probably better.

I've been a member of Yelp for quite some time now, and this is my first review.  The meal was so good I felt I needed to share.

The Restaurant
A wonderfully intimate, yet whimsical, environment that's puts you in the mood for a fun evening out.  There is a small bar area where you can enjoy a drink while waiting for your table.  I recommend their signature cocktail, the Veuve Framboise (it's like a really good Kir Royale).  Mmmm.  When you arrive at your table, you might even be blessed with a view of the Bellagio fountains.

The Service
Le Cirque has mastered the art of constantly checking in on your table from a slight distance to make sure everything is going well.  There is nothing worse than enjoying a great meal with constant bombardment from the staff.  Each member of the staff has certain roles.  For example, only the sommelier refilled our wine glasses.  Nice touch!  Speaking of the sommelier, he suggested a great Bordeaux that was reasonably priced.

The Food
No matter how great the decor or service is, the bottom line is the food.  Each dish that came out (we each had an app, entree, and dessert) was better than the last.  I started with risotto that had freshly shaved truffles and champagne.  One of the best risotto dishes I've ever had.  In fairness, this was a fairly expensive supplement to the standard cost but well worth every penny.  This was followed by a duck course that was prepared in about 3 different styles.  I'm craving a return trip just for this dish!  My meal ended with a chocolate souffle.  Shockingly enough, it was great.  ;)

I've been to many of the top restaurants in Las Vegas, and I can say that whenever I get asked for a recommendation for high end dining in the city, Le Cirque will be the first restaurant I mention.",F_QyWtaeGeRjNZvWnVbOfw,4,2,5,GnM5_ehNTiDDXGdwNcilqg

He was willing to make a custom wine pairing with our choices which we took him up on. The food at these kinds of restaurants is always stellar and unforgettable. I have to say that the dish that stood out was the one he recommended strongly - the rabbit. It was like comfort food to the tenth power. This dish had very warming flavors that cover the tongue with a blanket of savory-ness. *thinking about it right now*

Oh and they also served a raspberry champagne concoction that I loved. 

My father ordered a chocholate desert and when they serve it they pour hot liquid chocholate on top of this chocholate bowl and it melts a hole in the top - just very cool presentation that I had to mention.

Aside from this the atmosphere is not typical. I love the dim lighting mixed with the colorful patterns surrounding. 

There are simply so many excellent restaurants in Vegas to choose from and if you value excellent service paired with awesome food and atmosphere - I would recommend this.

Upon entering the dinning room, we could see that the space was small and intimate, overlooking the lake and fountains. 

The waiters here are nothing short of exceptional, both friendly and helpful. My wife wasn't too crazy about the choices for one of the 5 courses, so our waiter was able to offer up a different alternative that was agreeable. One of the things that I truely appreciated was that the waiters took the time as each dish was served to explain what each dish was and how it was plated. Far too often I read a menu description only to be uncertain as to what's on the plate that has been put in front of me.

 To start with we were served an amuse-bouche of pureed peas with what looked to be a bit of mash mellow, this we all agreed was delightful. Next came the appetizer. I had the escargot and it was very good as well and I believe that everyone at the table enjoyed their choices as also. I have a weird restaurant theory that appetizers are usually the best things on the menu and my theory was mostly proven correct again. I think that the only person that really enjoyed their entree was my friend that ordered the the steak with the red wine reduction, this came at an additional cost of $ 45.00 which seemed like a lot considering that each of us paid $ 98.00 for our 3 course meals. I ordered the Black Cod and as a former fisherman in Canada and Alaska I know what great fish tastes like and this was not great fish!......my fault I guess, as I already know that fish should never be ordered unless you can see the ocean. My lovely girlfriend ordered the veal and it was not at all to our liking so consider yourself warned. Desert for the table was great for some and only OK for others. I had the crème brûlée which was fine but certainly not outstanding. The wait staff was great! Our waiter was a tall thin gentleman who had the perfect combination of tact, attentiveness and a friendly attitude. He as well as the other staff were very nice and accommodating.
 I would love to give this place a better rating but I just don't think we got our money's worth. Dinner for each of us ended up costing on average about $ 150 and that is a lot in my book......on the other hand it made me appreciate the great food that I get to enjoy at home ( Walla Walla WA) that cost significantly less and on most accounts is much better.

What set Le Cirque apart from other restaurants was the fantastic staff. For background, I had just turned 24 and my friend was 23. We were the only people under 30 and the only platonic friends. Usually in a restaurant like this, I expect to be talked down to and ignored. This was not at all the case. Our servers were very respectful and treated us like any other clients and even matched our whimsy at times. It made us feel much more comfortable and less out of place.",RQpAIOM3lBRWgtNkBiGGIg,0,0,5,nlwgycUdN69V44M1LEqh4A

I'll break it down:

Service - impeccable.  Totally spot-on, without being stuffy formal.  They didn't miss a beat from filling glasses, setting proper cutlery, serving, follow-up...all of it was perfect.

Presentation - while not over the top architectural, it is French Classical cuisine, so presentation is tight and clean.  The dinnerware was lovely and different.  lol

Food - outstanding.  There was a pinot noir butter sauce on the sea bass that I could have drank from a demitasse cup.  Apparently I moaned through every course, as the food was just THAT GOOD. 

And, to top it off, they give you a lovely little red jewelry box filled with chocolate truffles to take home.

My only ""complaint"" is that I wish they instituted some kind of dress code.  I know it's Vegas, but the couple next to us was in tee-shirts and sneakers/jeans.  To me, fine dining should require a bit of class from the patrons.

My parents, though not formally diagnosed as compulsive gamblers, liked Las Vegas... a lot.
We'd make the 6 hour drive from Salt Lake City to Vegas 4 or 5 times a year.  I've spent some interesting holidays in Vegas as a kid, some highlights off the top of my head:

- Age 14, buying a chocolate milkshake at the Burger King in the food court of the MGM Casino.  I was alone.
- Age 10, 12, 15, Thanksgiving dinner at the Stardust Buffet (RIP)
- Age 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc... Trolling the midway arcade at Circus Circus with a pocket full o' quarters.

Aaaah, the memories sweep over me like a wave.  God I was pathetic!!!
Now that I'm older and have more than a roll of quarters in my pockets (remember, size doesn't matter), my Vegas experience is vastly different.  The main difference is that wifey won't let me go cheap here because she's a wallflowery princess.

In the spirit of living high off the hog, we dine at Nevada's branch of the famous New York institution, Le Cirque.

In short, it's good.

But I have a problem with circus themes, the clowns give me nightmares.  The other problem is that when you tell people you dined at Le Cirque, most assume it's the one in NY.  Definitely less snob-appeal.  But I guess if you're in Vegas, edgy sophistication is pretty much thrown out the door.

The staff are masters of their craft and the service was polite, informative, genuine, and funny. I cannot applaud them enough. 

I went with a couple of friends of mine and I ordered a vodka cocktail and the five course menu. Regrettably I forgot the ingredients of the cocktail but I believe it's name is the Le Solitaire and it was pleasant. 

First course was the yellowtail with heart of palm and a nice vinaigrette. The fish was silky, not the slightest bit fishy and in every way exceeded expectations. Obviously the plating was amazing as well. 

Second course was foie gras with buckwheat and a st. Germaine sauce. It was decadent and fatty and just hit on all levels.

Between courses the chef sent us a complimentary bite to try. I remember it was incredible but regretfully I only remember some of the ingredients. I believe it was a foam/carrot sort of thing, amazing and appreciated though. 

Third course was a scallop with a coconut Thai sauce. I must admit I am not a fan of scallops but I took a risk on this. It was fresh, the sauce was yummy, and the plating was very cool. Overall though I wish I traded it out for something else, the best scallop on earth is simply not for me, and this was a fun way to learn that haha. 

Fourth course was the Kobe beef with a nice bordelaise sauce, oxtail in a potato cylinder of sorts and a fine mushroom. best steak I've ever had....best sauce too! The oxtail was also divine. 

Then the waiter brought us a palate cleanser. A sort of orb of juice that was very welcome after the heavier dishes. 

Last was the chocolate ball desert. A ice cream ball made of chocolate hazelnut that they melt with hot chocolate. Addicting and soooo tasty!

Don't get me wrong, I really love garlic and butter and Le Cirque's dish had it's fair share, but with a lovely sophisticated twist.

I'm surprised it wasn't given a second star because I honestly felt that it ranked up there in quality and the experience. In my opinion, I had a better experience here than in Picasso, which has 2 Michelin stars.

Le Cirque is physically smaller than Picasso, and the theme is different too. Le Cirque has a ""circus"" feel to it with the murals of circus acts and I like the silk drapery that simulates being in a big circus tent. It also has some respectable views of the fountains too, that is if you score a table by the window.

The degustation menu is the only way to go if you have relatively no time constraints (2.5 hours) at Le Cirque. But they also have a smaller pre-theater menu as well. And with 15 somelliers on staff at Bellagio, getting the wine pairing is must.

The wine pairing was the best I've seen. And I only chose the somellier wine pairing. They have the more superior premium wine pairing, but I was already wowed with the cheaper version.

The 5 course menu was carefully and meticulously prepared. My favorite was the dessert. I chose the banana souffle and I would honestly come back, and just sit at the bar, and order 2 of these very decadent dishes. The best souffle I've ever had.

I had the lamb trio for the entree. There was a lamb chop, lamb meatball, and sweetbread (thymus gland). It was accompanied by mini spring veggies, golden raisin, and a mustard au jus sauce. The standout of the plate was the sweetbread, with its creamy flavor and dense texture, as well as the golden raisins, which packed a sweet and tart punch that reset my palate for the next bite of lamb. 

My husband had the Dover Sole with the beurre blanc sauce and glazed string beans. The fish was breaded and fried and with the sauce literally painted on with some green veggies (which was later then doused on!!), with was a piece of art both visually and taste wise. 

For dessert, I had the panna cotta with blood orange gelee and honeycomb. It was quite a large portion. It was light and refreshing, and the honeycomb was so fun and yummy. Where has honeycomb been all my life?!? 

My husband had the chocolate ball. Upon serving, melted chocolate was poured over the chocolate ball to revel the malt center with hazelnut center and vanilla ice cream.  It tasted just like a Ferrero Rocher candy.

The ambiance and decor are lovely and interesting and the many staff members with whom we interacted were all pleasant and professional.  Then came the food, which also was delicious and well prepared in every respect.  It would seem a 5 star review is in order.  The problem is what we have been dealing with after our visit to LeCirque.  First our friend, now back in AUS, contacted us to say he'd been billed twice on his credit card and asked us to check our bill.  At the restaurant we asked the server to split our check equally onto two credit cards.  Our friend had two charges for approx. $400 on his card and to our surprise our card also had been double billed with another two charges for $400.  Ok, seems easy enough to correct what could have been a simple error.  Not too easy, unfortunately, because multiple email and phone calls to the MGM and to LeCirque have gone  unanswered for one month now.  The only option for both of us was to dispute the charges with the AMEX Centurion desk and answer questions and waste our time.

We both decided to get the Prix Fixe menu ($105/person), which includes an appetizer, entree and any one dessert. The Sommelier assisted us in picking a bottle of wine in a friendly and informative matter. 

We were provided an Amuse-bouche of salmon, which was fresh and delicious. The meal only got better. Each course was described to us and was as delicious as they sounded. The escargot was amazing - as well as the lamb.

5040954,2017-07-02,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Excellent dining experience at Le Cirque. I ordered the Pre Theater menu ($72) with wine pairing ($40.) 

Le Cirque lived up to my expectations. The staff were friendly, swift, courteous, and well informed.

The meal began with an amuse bouche of an acidic lemony foam with, beneath, a savoury carrot puree. The flavors were forcefully challenging yet very well balanced. Excellent way to start the meal with a thougtful bite from the kitchen to get me thinking.

The bread was very good. I've had fresher bread at other fine dining restaurants, but the flavors were nonetheless well balanced and the crumb soft enough. I appreciated the juxtaposition of salted and unsalted butter on the same plate, preferring the salted variety. The choices of bread were varied and consistent with other fine dining restaurants
 No surprises for the bread course.

The escargot had a plump bite with just enough chew to give it body and allow mouth time for the sauce flavors to meld in the palate. I found the sauce a bit too bitter and leafy for the relative medium softness of the butter/something bitter in there sauce. The sauce of the dish was a bit gloopy for my tastes and had a bit of a xanthan gum mouthfeel. The chablis wine pairing was crisp and sweet, a complement to the bittery dish.

The potato-crusted black bass over braised leeks was so good. Though the bass seemed a bit dehydrated/overexecuted (cooked maybe to 137f instead of 131f) the dishes flavors were outstanding. The savoury potato and fresh firm fish were lavished by the soft yet complex slight acidity of the leeks and buttery pinot noir sauce. The dish naturally paired well with pinot noir, which was an element lightly accented within the dish.

For dessert I chose the chocolate ball. The waiter pours hot sauce over it at the table which mesmerizingly melts away the chocolate exterior. This dish is bitter and sweet with dark chocolate crust, hazelnut notes, and a crunchy, toffee like crush interspersing smooth ice cream. The port wine paired well with its syrupy deep sweetness and oaky complexity.

The final bites were hazelnut and raspberry macaroons with a Pâte de Fruit. All was soft and freshly fruity.

Le Cirque made me feel at home. It took me away from the garish facade that is the Vegas casino. They present an authentic and intelligent fine dining experience amidst the gambling harpies of vegas hotel conglomerates.",EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,1,1,5,QNIi0awa-p2BliwDXZMRqA

We were at the outlets before and weren't even appropriately dressed but we were too tired and too hungry to go anywhere and didn't care that it was expensive. 

We got a table for 7 quickly. We had 3 hungry kids who only wanted pasta and nothing fancy and Martin helped make it happened. His service was excellent, friendly and entertaining and I was very impressed he made the grouchy kids very happy. He knew exactly what they wanted and they ate everything on their plate.

5178842,2010-12-03,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Having eaten so many times at Le Cirque, I would say I am a bit of an expert.  I've had everything on the menu, sometimes multiple times, and I can honestly say that they do not serve even a single bad dish.  This is one high-class restaurant that has earned their Five Diamonds.  In fact, their sister location in New York City has been the haunt of many of the cities elite.  Ever since their opening of their Las Vegas location in The Bellagio, they have been a shining star in the Las Vegas dining scene.

The fine french style cuisine is separated into two sections on the menu: Classic and Contemporary.  They have a well prepared prix fixe menu, that I would recommend for the indecisive, but I have always just chosen my own.  One thing I would leave up to the staff would be the wine pairings.  The Sommelier is very accomplished, and knows exactly how to find a perfect match between your personal tastes and the food you are eating.  For those more interested in a liquor or cocktail pairing the Bartender is as seasoned and artful as they come.  

Here are my suggestions for the Appetizer and the Entree, both for the Classic and the Contemporary

Appetizer, Classic:  Salade de Homard
This lobster and fresh greens salad is in a black truffle oil dressing, and it is their signature appetizer.  It is crisp, fresh, lightly rich, and expertly well balanced.  A perfect prelude to a fine meal.

Appetizer, Contemporary:  Risotto du Marché
While the risotto they serve changes once each season, I have yet to have one that wasn't completely decadent.  I believe one of the best I've had was the Wild Mushroom and gruyère.

Entree, Classic:  Cur de Filet de Buf
When people ask me my absolute favorite food, this is what I tell them.  A large rare to medium rare tenderloin steak, sautéed foie gras on top, with little potato croquettes and sweet onion compote.  And of course, plenty of the reduction made from the steak.  While fine dining has a stigma of not being filling, this is one large dish that I have only managed to finish once out of the several times I've ordered it.  If you plan on it, get a salad for your entree, and maybe take desert to go.

Entree, Contemporary:  Magret de Canard
This dish of Honey Duck Magret uses the natural richness and flavor of the duck to play with the sweet flavors of the Black Mission Fig, Apricot, Daikon Radish, and Cassis Coulis.  This is something that I would not only be surprised to see on Iron Chef America or Top Chef Masters, but even impressed.

With whatever dessert you find most fitting, they also serve a tray several small bites such as a mini-raspberry tart, dark chocolate covered almond slivers, and tiny meringues.  And finally to go, they give each party a tiny chest of drawers, with a chocolate truffle to remind you of your experience.

And believe me, if it is your first time or your thirtieth, you will always be thinking and wishing for the next time you will go.",Vu5hXr3Lmv6aSlTLpSPboQ,3,0,5,ZEHoSYexP3P0f1GWLosNZA

The servers are wonderful. They're courteous and want you to have the best dining experience possible. Plus, if you're off to see a show like we were right after dinner, they time the dinner carefully and even give you directions on where to pick up your tickets/see the show.

The food, however, fell a bit short for even the discounted theater prix fixe we were paying. For the price we expected straight A atmosphere, service, and an almost perfect meal. We did love the variety of bread though! The appetizers impressed: my boyfriend loved his escargot, and my risotto was great, although not mind-blowing. The entrees, what was meant to be the star of the meal, was the part that disappointed. My seared salmon was only luke warm, although cooked perfectly, and lacked an interesting flavor profile to lift it from decent to excellent. It may even have been under-seasoned. More of the singular tomato on the dish would have brightened it. My boyfriend can't recall his entrée, except that it was ""alright,"" meaning it was not memorable. His father mistakenly ordered a chicken dish thinking it had foie gras in it (it only had foie jus), and was so distraught about it they actually brought out a little plate of foie gras for him. (The service was really above and beyond!) He was very happy about this, but without the little side of foie gras, we all agreed it would have been a very bland chicken dish (even a little dry at times).

As for dessert, we had banana soufflé. It was unfortunately slightly undercooked, although the flavor was pleasant and light.

We made a reservation a few months ago online to this restaurant, and my family were very excited about the experience. We arrived right on time (or probably 1 minute earlier), but it took at least 10 minutes for the crews to prepare a table for us. The attendance had to run back and forth several times to ""create"" a table. After 10 minutes, they found us a table and got us seated. 

So at first we didn't feel like they were prepared for their customers. 

What's worse? They gave us a table right at the location that all waiters would have to pass. We understood that the restaurant was fully booked so we were ok with it. The thing is, everyone who walked by us would hit our chairs. Literally, everyone. 

We tried to move our entire table away from the walkway at least a foot, unfortunately our seats were still got bumped all night long, plus the person on the other side got a smaller space. 

My parents still keep complaining about this experience after several days, that's a really bad experience for us. 

The food themselves are just fine. 

At the end of the meal, it's time to pay. Be careful with the tip they calculated -- it is calculated after tax, which means 18% is actually 24%, 20% is actually 28%, you get the idea. Unfortunately we didn't calculate, so we paid the tips after tax. 

One more thing to mention -- they messed up the order of the main course. We had to pass the dishes to each other for the entire table.

Atmosphere
The circus theme is gorgeous, the lighting dim and pleasant, the music classy and quiet. The seating is very comfortable and the signature plates with the restaurant name on them are a nice touch. The silver ware arrives and removed every course. The napkins are a thick soft fabric and don't have that over washed bleached feel of lesser restaurants. We asked for fountain view seating and although you can see the fountains in this restaurant I would recommend just enjoying Le Cirque. It was nice being able to see a glimpse of the fountains with dinner but at the same time you couldn't hear the music the fountains were performing to so it was just pretty water at that point.

Service
Wow, wow, wow, wow, did I say wow? I mean literally I felt like I was the only person in the dining room. While my food was in front of me and I was eating I felt like I was alone in the room. As soon as I had finished and it was apparent I was done eating my plate magically disappeared, my setting cleared, and my water topped off. It was amazing and just down right impressive the level of service provided in this place. It was our anniversary and they made sure to wish us a happy anniversary as well as have it written in chocolate on our dessert plates. Our wait staff was personable and great everyone was just stellar. Not only that but after dinner the manager personally emailed us and thanked us for dining with them. If I could award them a extra star I would without hesitation. 

The food

Amuse bouche
It was a small glass of tomato gazpacho with fresh veggies and a small butter pastry on the side. What a mouth watering start this was a complex flavored tasty little treat to start us out. The pasty was so soft and buttery it was a true Amuse Bouche in every sense.

First course
Risotto Du Marche 
Me and the wife both wanted risotto and boy did we make the right choice. It was a mushroom risotto with a blend of gruyère and one other cheese I cannot recall. This dish was hearty, flavorful, and just down right amazing. 

The wine pairing was a crisp chardonnay that blended well with the dish and was surprisingly sweet for a chardonnay. 

Main course
I had the Salmon and my wife selected the Sea Bass.

My salmon was perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the top. I requested mine cooked medium and the kitchen nailed it. The gnocchi and vegetables were amazing and complemented the dish perfectly. The portion was a perfect size and was a much more filling dish then I expected. 

My wifes sea bass was a more simple dish with the bass, a bed of simple veggies, and a pinot noir reduction. The reduction was amazing the fish well prepared and she was very pleased with it. 

Wine Pairing was a nice pinot noir  it was a lighter pinot noir and was a very good match for our fish as it was not over powering. 

Dessert
My wife was given the souffle and was given the chocolate sphere. Oh my were these desserts exquisite. They were sweet, decadent, and extremely good. These are very rich desserts and I cannot even begin to embellish how outstanding these were. They also serve a assortment of small chocolates and candies that are outrageously good. 

Wine Pairing
An amazing moscato was served paired with our dinner and it was so good I am literally searching where to buy it. We love moscato and this was by far one of the best we have tasted.

I was slightly disappointed with the menu though - the items that I did want to try, for example the foie gras or the prime beef tenderloin, there was additional cost. 

They came around serving us bread to start but we got to choose from  a variety - bacon cheese biscuit, coffee chocolate bread, pretzel, etc. Coffee chocolate bread was really good! They came around for seconds, and I of course, had another piece :P They also served us another appetizer on house, which was a panna cotta and salmon topped with caviar and gold flakes. This was really tasty as well.

For starters I ordered the Hamachi, Japanese yellowtail. Essentially it was like Hamachi carpaccio, served with avocado puree, mandarins, cucumbers and yuzu glaze. Not only was the presentation lovely, but the dish itself tasted really good as well, really refreshing. All the ingredients went well with each other, loved all the flavors combined. The quality of the Hamachi fish was really fresh.

For my main I ordered the ""filet de loup de mer"", which was the seabass wrapped with a thinly sliced crispy potato served on top of braised leeks and Pinot Noir verjus. This was really tasty. The seabass was cooked perfectly, the meat was tender and juicy, not dry at all. I was surprised the potato could have been made that thinly sliced to wrap the fish and surprisingly it held up crispy and wasn't soggy at all. 

For dessert I ordered the chocolate ball. It was cute how they poured the hot chocolate, which melted the ball devouring it to a praline mousse with white chocolate icecream and hazelnut caramel crunches. I was really surprised that the icecream held up and didn't melt. 
After dessert they also served us a dessert tray with candy gummies and macaroons. The macaroons were disappointing. I would have expected something better coming from this restaurant.

Overall the dining experience was great. The service was good, staff were really friendly. Although I didn't get to order the menu items that I originally wanted to try, all the menu items which I did try turned out to be really good.

 I've sampled several other ""high end"" Vegas dining options in my previous trips but Le Cirque put them all to shame. Le Cirque is certainly expensive but I'd consider it better value for the cost than similarly priced alternatives (Micheal Mina, Picasso, SAGE, Eiffel Restaurant). I'd very much recommend the 6 course Tasting Menu (135) with the wine pairings (68 and 88 I believe). You can't go wrong with either the standard or the premium wines and they really are intended as an integral part of the meal. Some of the pairings are adventurous and wholly surprising (A red wine with the cod; a caramel, almost chocolatey, wine with the creme brulee) and I found these to be the most rewarding of the bunch. Moreover, the food is not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing. Foie gras has never looked or tasted as good as when accompanied by apricots and chocolate sauce. However you should be aware that the full tasting menu is quite time consuming (at least 2 hours) but the staff is so precise and the new courses so well timed that it never drags. I realized that quite a few of the costumers preferred that prix-fixe 98 dollar 3 course option where you have the option of mixing and matching just about anything from the menu. 

The staff itself is professional and courteous to the fault. Our head server described all the dishes as they were served with the precision of a mathematician while the head sommelier was wonderfully gregarious, telling us the history behind every wine in French (with a native accent, of course). The decor is charming and whimsical yet classy.  

Strangely at the end of our meal, the head server for our table offered his assistance in  finding us a car/limo service, club passes, and show tickets. I've personally never been offered concierge service by a French waiter but I suppose a restaurant priding itself on the thoroughness of its service like Le Cirque might potentially offer such services.",IOf-UvT_gfpP1c7s3HYx3Q,2,1,5,AKwYpuYtauns2zM86PjSOg

Carl took fantastic care of us along with the rest of the staff.  I ordered the Digestion prix fixe menue with the wine pairing as I did last time.  Expensive, yes, but compared to comparable meals in Vegas for the same money it is still the best bargain for the number of courses and quality of food. 

In a nutshell, this is the best fine French meal you will find in Vegas for the money.  You can find several more places in Vegas to spend more (much more!) and maybe they will be better meals and experiences, but as far as I""m concerned, I'm VERY happy with Le Cirque and will return.  I think you will be too.

Ask for Carl.  He will take great care of you and his personality is great.

5263416,2013-09-09,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Came here last night with the guys.  We are in town for NFL opening weekend and we wanted to dress up and have a nice meal while we were here.

After looking at many many yelp reviews we made reservations here for Saturday night at 8:15pm.  We were seated after a few minutes and we all ordered the 5 course degustation menu.  3 of us had the sommelier wine pairing and one of us had the premium wine pairing.  

The amuse bouche was a galette with goat cheese and something crunchy.  It was really delicious and definitely amused my mouth.  We were also offered several types of bread: french, pretzel, bacon, rosemary, and chocolate.  The french bread was standard, the pretzel bread was pretty good, the bacon bread was super bacon-y, and the chocolate was the clear winner.  It had some nuts, which gave it a nice change of texture and the chocolate was subtle.  Very good!  Great start to our meal.

For the first course, one of us got the country egg with caviar (additional $15 charge) and it looked really good! The rest of us got the snow crab.  This was my second favorite course of the night.  The snow crab was wrapped in avocado and was covered in delicious sauce and some roe.  The result was a creamy delicious light crab flavor.  SO GOOD!!

For the second course, most of us ordered the foie gras and one of us ordered the langostine.  After tasting the foie gras, I asked to taste my husband's langostine.  As he looked longingly at my dish, the amazing balance of flavors on his dish overwhelmed me and I quickly said, ""let's switch!"" The boys all really liked the foie gras, but it was a bit too sweet for my tastes.  The langostine tasted beautiful.  It was my favorite dish last night.

The third course: 2 of us got the sea bass wrapped in potato and 2 of us got the barramundi.  The barramundi was the winner of this round.  It was tender and flavorful.  The sea bass was a bit dry and not as flavorful as the barramundi.

For the fourth course, 2 of us got the duck and 2 of us got the pork.  At this point in the meal, we were getting pretty full.  The duck and pork were both alright; the pork was slightly better.  It could have used more seasoning.

For dessert, we had been eyeing other tables and there was this really cool presentation where there was a chocolate ball, they poured chocolate sauce on it and the ball melted.  SO COOL! I definitely had to get that.  Someone else got the banana souffle and another person got the sugar sphere with chocolate and cherries inside.  The chocolate ball was amazing as was the souffle.  The sugar sphere was a very interesting presentation, but the taste was just okay.  

Service was incredible throughout the meal.  The dining area is a little bit loud so I had to shout a little bit to our waiter.  The sommelier was so awesome! He would swing by our table to explain the wines, drop some knowledge, and tell us an entertaining story.  Turns out, he lived in the Philippines for 11 years and he spoke Tagalog to me! To hear a Frenchman speak in Tagalog.  That's the dream.  The wine pairings were all incredible and paired well with the food.  

OH! Also the greatest  thing ever! They give all female diners a little jewelry box with truffles in them at the end of the meal! I felt so appreciated! 

Overall, it was a great dining experience.  The husband and I ended up paying $500, which was definitely a splurge.  However, I liked the food at Providence (in LA) better, but that's just because I'm partial to seafood.  We had a great time and a great, albeit expensive, experience.",BoRDC7m0JP1pm1OapkDG7A,4,4,4,Qyqm4oBUHqEaVdUiSo7sxw

5279550,2018-03-21,4,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Consistently one of Las Vegas' best Restaurants for nearly twenty years it was on the eighth day of new toque Alan Mardonovich's tenure that a late celebration was scheduled at Le Cirque, the young Chef's move from Joel Robuchon bringing a new set of skills to Bellagio's most exclusive dining room and a look at several works in progress showing plenty of reasons to be excited for the upcoming Spring menu.

Hot on the heels of another 5-Star recognition from Forbes, the plaque adorning walls both inside and out alongside other accolades, it was with warm greetings from General Manager Ivo Angelov that guests were welcomed moments prior to a 6:30pm reservation, the familiar staff once again found serving a full-house of guests from various backgrounds and several with time constraints.

Taking a seat in the dining room for the first time in over a year, a rounded alcove looking out on the Bellagio fountains better fitting a birthday than the usual bar seats, it was with carte blanche deferred to Chef Mardonovich that the meal began shortly after Cocktails, two old favorites joined by specially crafted Mocktails for a ten year old that made him immediately feel comfortable sitting amongst adults in his shirt and tie.

Dining under the big top with classical music playing lightly overhead, the room's whimsy and a veteran staff creating a refined environment that is anything but stuffy, it was shortly after the first bites of Le Cirque's White Chocolate Coffee Bread that an amuse arrived, the legendary Crab still available but seeing a rival for complexity in chopped Oysters served with a spoon of Caviar plus individual frozen Raspberry cells.

Moving forward to an enlarged version of Le Cirque's Yellowtail painted in Yuzu with textural toppings, the service outside a vessel without liquid better allowing the Fish to show its quality, course three once again presented Ossetra Caviar acting as a garnish, this time atop early-season Asparagus and citrusy Sauce that saw everyone including the youngster happy to eat their Vegetables.

Next reinterpreting a Le Cirque classic with the nouveau Black Tie Scallop, a plate dating back to Daniel Boulud's days in Manhattan as elegant as ever beneath shaved Black Truffles and Sauce Perigourdine, it was in follow-up that two new courses spoke of Mardonovich's training and perhaps Le Cirque's future, a tender slice of Dover Sole first crusted in Bread Crumbs and Sea Urchin with a stuffed ring of Marrow followed by Chicken and Lobster bathed fragrant Bisque with Carrots and Turnips smaller than a thimble.

At this point well-sated but excited by what was to come it was with plates centered on two proteins long-missing from Le Cirque's menu that Alan rounded out savories, the sizable Sweetbread seared crispy with an unctuous center made lightly sweet by Honey providing a beautiful juxtaposition to a stuffed Morel while rosy Duck topped tableside with Sauce Cassis found its dance partner in Chartreuse-scented Liver.

Quickly cleansing the palate with Le Cirque's liquid-centered Pineapple and Lavender ""Explosion"" plus a cup of Coffee it was once again a surprise to see a new Dessert despite no change to the posted menu, the Strawberry Parfait outpacing its predecessor in terms of subtle sweetness and layered flavors while the rest was highlighted by a Grand Marnier Soufflé flamed and then extinguished with Crème Anglaise.

FIVE STARS: No doubt a difficult task in replacing Wilfried Bergerhausen, though Christmas from sous-Chef Billy Maldonado showed well, it  seems Le Cirque has found their man in Alan Mardonovich to help push the Restaurant forward and if these preview plates are any indication it seems another visit later this season is  well advised.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,9,5,B_aqyyTYZKbRlgnWQ13QDw

We got the Degustation meal and had 5 courses. The best item was the Maryland blue crab with caviar on top. The next best item was the risotto with black truffles, next was the braised veal cheeks. The meat was so tender it wouldn't even stay on the fork. And the chocolate ball finished the night on a sweet side.

The sea-bass a bit overcooked for my liking. And the chocolate coffee bread was the best tasting bread ever. I tried to google a recipe for it and didn't find any that looked the same or had similar ingredients. Must be a French thing. :-)",DIckqqZNAQwL5ySdqWIJyw,2,1,5,mBVlVHdJUMuvQRjw-48cZw
5294599,2009-12-21,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"After reading the reviews for Le Cirque, I knew I had to go here for my birthday. My boyfriend and I had tickets to see a late showing of 'O' a the Blahgio, which topped off our amazing night.

I was just too happy for anything at Le Cirque to annoy me, but in retrospect there were a couple of things. The waiters were extremely friendly, which was wonderful, but a little slow for a place of that caliber. For example, my wine glass stayed completely empty for about five minutes, until finally my boyfriend refilled it for me. Our server turned around at that moment and looked on in horror, then rushed to our table to see if there was anything else we needed. 

The pate was okay, but not great. The rabbit was so salty I was chugging water. I guess the server noticed and came to ask me if everything was all right. I apologized profusely, then told him what the problem was. He also apologized, joking that ""the chef is from Alsace"" (which he is). He offered me something else off the menu, but it wouldn't have arrived on time so we skipped to dessert. My souffle came with a candle melted to the plate, which was a really nice touch. They have their own customized plates that are adorable. I forgot to ask whether they were available for purchase.

In all, the experience was wonderful, and even the mistakes the restaurant made were duly corrected. I loved the tastefully accomplished circus theme of the place. We were seated close enough to the window to be able to see the water show as well.

I don't think I will go there again (unless I happen to see 'O' a third time), but I would certainly recommend Le Cirque for a pre-show meal. I will be heading to New York soon, and hope to try their tasting menu over there.",6woTWCjHDMEjQclniEei-A,1,1,4,u1suXyvXsmWvbSrDbwA3Zw

This place is small (about 60-80 max capacity) so make sure you make a reservation. They do not have patio seating bu there are tables near the windows with a view of Paris. It is circus-themed, hence, ""cirque""...but don't worry, they don't have clowns walking around!

I almost ordered from the degustation menu when  my sister pointed out that my favorite escargot isn't included in that menu. So we both each got an appetizer, entree and dessert instead. My sister wanted to get the sea urchin but their shipment got stuck at the airport due to weather conditions.

Spiced Pumpkin Cappuccino with Warm Gougere:
A frothy pumpkin soup with a small cheese pastry. Just a few sips and you're done. Great warm cappuccino and the gougere was tasty. 4/5

Escargots au Beurre d'Ail:
Burgundy snails in garlic herb butter with confit tomato, croutons and Parma prosciutto. One of my favorite things is escargot. Generous portion of garlicky buttery and slightly crisp escargot. I was dipping my bread in garlic butter after I was done with the escargot. 5/5

Hamachi:
Yellowtail marinated in citrus with avocado, heart of palm, cucumber and orange blossom smoke. The presentation was very nice. Orange blossom smoke coming from the bottom of the plate. The hamachi is fresh. 5/5

Filet de Loup de Mer:
Potato crusted Mediterranean sea bass with braised leeks and Pinot Noir reduction. One of Le Cirque's classic dishes. The crust was so light but slightly crisp. The Pinot Noir reduction was amazing with the fish. 5/5

Degustation de Porc Berkshire:
Pork chop, soy-glazed pork belly, butternut squash puree, truffled haricots tarbais, marjoram cider cream sauce and chestnut confit. The highlight of this dish was the pork belly - it was tender and melts in your mouth. 5/5

Petite Boule de Chocolate, Eclats de Noisette Caramelisee, Glace Chocolat Blanc:
Chocolate ball with praline mousse, hazelnut caramel crunch, white chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce. You get a ball of chocolate with gold leaf on top and your server will pour hot chocolate over the chocolate ball causing it to melt parts of it and exposing the hazelnut crunch and ice cream. 5/5

Foret Noir dans sa Boule de Sucre, Cerises Morello en Kirsch, Cacao Sorbet:
Black Forrest crumble in sugar sphere, cocoa sorbet and Morello cherries in Kirsch. This was my sister's choice for dessert since she likes black forest. The presentation was fantastic. You get a red ball made of sugar and inside it is all the goodies. The cherries were a bit too bitter and medicine-like for me so I didn't like this dessert but then again, this was not my choice. If you like black forest then you'd probably like this.

Petit Fours:
Chocolate with gold leaf, marshmallow, lemon blueberry and profiteroles. My favorites were the chocolate and the profiteroles. 4/5

We were each given souvenir truffles. Service was good. Bread service includes: pretzels, baguette, rosemary and feta, bacon and cheddar, etc. and they'll give you unsalted and salted butter. Overall, it was a great dining experience.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,8,5,wyC89PNVsTvOu1BJmXGAvQ

Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good. 

It's really not fair to Le Cirque that this was our dinner the night after a magical time at Guy Savoy (GS), but that's how the cookie crumbled. 

The gaudy interior took me back to Joël Robuchon and made me long for the clean and modern space of GS:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#Pz6MCvMoqe20cjiEN61ICA

We elected the full Degustation Menu and each got different things to maximize the number of dished to try. At $135pp plus $88 to share a wine pairing, Le Cirque really sticks it to you, which I'm fine with if the food is great. 

In short, we were not impressed by much and some of the food was just bad. The service was stuffy, borderline arrogant at times, and without stealth. Pretty much the opposite of GS. 

It wasn't all bad though, the poached egg with caviar ($15 extra) was very nice. The veggies were cooked right and the paprika crostini was a delight;

I tasted my friend's lobster bisque from the pre-theater menu and thought that was much better.  I had upgraded to the beef w/fois gras and it was good, but again, nothing special even with fois gras on top --of which there was very little I might add. Even my dessert -- a young cocount with sorbet and pineapples was very lackluster. It looked kinda cool coming out in the coconut but you can't taste the coconut cuz it's hard so it's really just sorbet w/some pineapple chunks. I wouldn't recommend it. 

All in all I think it was an okay meal but not of the caliber I expected based on the notoriety of the NYC Le Cirque. With so many good food options in Las Vegas, I doubt I'd ever go back here.",WvntDWMQnaEV8agu3gcTug,1,0,3,fNfVemoQGCcfH1t01a5VLQ

When we told the waiter that we were full and wanted to leave and could you please box up the rest of the food, we waited another twenty minutes at which point he brought out our entrees.  

I can't really fault the food.  Most of it was really delicious.  I really liked the duck that I got for my entree and would have really liked it later except the waiter threw it away and then tried to pretend that he didn't hear me say I wanted it boxed up.

To be fair, we spoke with the manager who comped an entire degustation meal but, even then, we spent $300.  I don't know if they were having an off night but the couple beside us and another table near us waited as long or longer and were also not very happy.  I'm pretty sure the large party near us also complained.

I might go back but probably only for the pre-theater menu.  It's too bad their service is so awful because the food is really good.  As a side note, the only thing I didn't like was the sea bass.  It had an odd flavor and seemed overcooked.",YXYm0ngQAC7ELXKZRGH2qA,0,0,3,u7I6V-e-_j3sHyvE46WEHw

As the dinner hour arrived, we wandered over to the Bellagio to check on a couple of options. Our first few choices were booked for the evening, but Le Cirque had a table for two for immediate seating.

We had been to Le Cirque two years earlier for my wife's birthday, and it is by far one of the best meals that we have ever had. She is not afraid to announce Le Cirque as her favorite restaurant. 

We were elated to be seated at the same table and to be served by the same server as we had during our last visit. Le Cirque is a fairly intimate setting without feeling crowded or stuffy. The service is timely, but not pushy. The Christmas Eve menu was simple, you could choose from one of two tastings: the Chirstmas tasting, or the Christmas Truffle tasting. Since this was an ""unplanned"" dinner we chose to stick closer to our budget and have the $155.00 standard Christmas tasting as opposed to the $255.00 truffle menu.

I decided against a wine pairing, but had Michael (our server) choose a nice glass of Pinot that arrived for our main course. Everything was sensational.

We chose this place based on the reviews and the fact we hadn't dined at Bellagio in quite a while.  With so many great eats popping up everywhere on the strip, you almost take for granted such great resorts like this.

I made the reservation about a month beforehand and only had a choice of 5:45 or earlier or 8pm on.  8pm it was.  The really cool decor is what strikes you upon entering along with a single rose given to the wife.  It's classy and cool with some bright colors thrown in.  We didn't get to have a cocktail at the bar as we were seated within seconds of looking at the drink menu.  

Service was impeccable and the 5 course dinner was unique and delicious.  The standout dishes included the Santa Barbara sea urchin with king crab.  My wife doesn't even like urchin and she finished it pretty quick.  Foie gras was awesome as expected.  

I took a shot on the ""Ris de Veau"" which I had never had before.  It's essentially veal guts that may or may not have contained the throat, pancreas, heart, belly etc.  I think the majority of it was stomach.  It was interesting to say the least, almost tasted like high-end cow brain.  Glad I tried it but I would go with my wife's terrific beef dish if I could do it again.  I finished it like a good boy :)

The desserts were very cool.  I'd never seen anything like the chocolate cigar with passion fruit sorbet which came in it's own ashtray.  I posted a pic of it.  My wife went with the sugar sphere with yuzu and raspberry.  That came in a clear hardshell sugar ball filled with the fruit inside.  You simply had to tap the top of the ball for it to crack and enjoy.  They also brought out some extra bite sized sweets and presented my wife with some extra chocolates as we were leaving.  

So why 4 stars?  I've had better dining experiences in Vegas.  Not just around town but at Bellagio itself.  I would rather do Picasso for the price.  And while the decor was nice, the tables were a bit cramped which didn't make Le Cirque as romantic as it could be.  You were able to listen to everyone else's conversations at all the tables nearby.  One couple two tables down kept going on and on about their kids and how they own 3 doughnut shops in Canada to some couple just trying to enjoy their own company.

Diner familial au restaurant Le Cirque avec ma femme et nos 3 enfants. Nous avions longtemps hésité entre Le Picasso, Le Cirque et les restaurants de Guy Savoye et de Robuchon. Notre dévolu s'était finalement porté sur Le Cirque qui nous semblait présenter le meilleur compromis prix/qualité.
Nous avons pris le menu dégustation pour 4 convives et mon plus jeune fils s'est vu proposer un plat de tagliatelles avec lequel il s'est régalé.
Le service est impeccable. Le Maitre d'hôtel, qui parlait un français parfait, était charmant avec les enfants. Le Sommelier était très compétent et évoquait ses vins avec une passion communicative. Seul petit loupé, le vin servi avec le Sea Bass est arrivé après l'assiette...

Côté dressage, l'harmonie des couleurs dans l'assiette était généralement bien choisie, notamment pour le carpaccio de langoustine. Les desserts étaient très joliment présentés (que ce soit la boule de chocolat, la crème brûlée, ou le soufflet au Grand Marnier)...sans être non plus très originaux.
Au niveau des cuissons, c'était un sans faute. Le Sea Bass était ferme comme il se doit, le foie gras parfaitement maitrisé et le veau était rosé et fondant à souhait.
Les saveurs, enfin, étaient intéressantes, certes, mais peut-être un peu en dessous de nos espérances. Les langoustines étaient probablement le plat le plus abouti à ce niveau, en mêlant audacieusement cacahuète, citrus, langoustine et caviar. Le Ruinart proposé dans l'accord mets-vin Premium était parfait, et probablement le meilleur des mariages proposés au menu.
Les saveurs du veau étaient très convenues et le jus de viande aurait supporté un assaisonnement un peu plus marqué. On avait aussi envie de trouver un peu de croquant dans le foie gras poêlé, ne fut-ce que quelques grains de sels pour relever ses saveurs.
Quant au Premium Wine Pairing que j'ai brièvement évoqué avec le Ruinart, il est plutôt décevant. Non par le choix des appellations qui sont plutôt judicieuses, mais plutôt par les domaines qui les représentent. Ainsi le Lacoste-Laborie 2004 était-il très court en bouche (la faute au millésime probablement) et le Sauternes accompagnant le dessert sans saveur (la faute au Domaine inconnu au bataillon).

All dishes but 1 was perfect for us (this is what i had wanted to take off the 1/2 star for). My fiancee had ordered escargot for appetizers and it was SO buttery and salty. You couldn't taste much aside from the butter. The portion was generous...but he couldn't finish eating it because it was so salty and buttery.

Everything else was perfectly delightful but the highlights - 
Lobster Salad Black Truffle Dressing - Generous portions of lobster, flavorful but light dressing, delicious and so beautifully presented. 

Beef Tenderloin, Sautéed Foie Gras, Smoked Serrano Potato Croquette, Sweet Onion Compote Supp. - The foie gras was perfectly cooked with a thin crunchy layer and a very generous portion.

Napoleon of Melon, Chilled Midori Melon Soup - This is incredibly refreshing! I loved the cantaloupe sorbet atop watermelon. It was both visually pleasing and awesome way to finish up dinner.

    I've been here countless of time before, since being a fan of the Bellagio for a decade and chef Sirio since New York, but this time was very special. New executive chef Wilfried Bergerhausen, he's talented, young, handsome and simply awesome. I met him at Michael Mina Bellagio last year. He was nice, genuine and talented. I knew it wouldn't be long before he could be an executive chef of some amazing restaurant.

   Chef Bergerhausen was the executive sous chef at Michael Mina at the Bellagio before he came to the Michelin Star Le Cirque. He replaces chef Paul Lee. Chef Bergerhausen worked at Joël Robuchon for almost 5 years, as well as L'Oasis in Mandelieu La Napoule, France. He was an assistant chef at Bocuse D'or, the worldwide cooking competition, with chef  Eric Finon, competed in Paris. 

    Experience the timeless sensation created by charismatic Restaurateur, Sirio Maccioni. The rarity of Le Cirque's AAA Five Diamond rating speaks eloquently of French cuisine - exquisite, bold, transcendent. Immerse yourself in a jubilant showing of brilliant color adorning this famed lakeside destination designed by Adam D. Tihany. The moment you walk in, you will feel this luxurious feel, elegantly designed, a bit bold, bright, but grande, it feels as I walk in a chateau, I feel royalty, I feel special and the service from the moment we walk in till we left, it was perfect in every single way. 

    We got lucky the wonderful GM Ivo Angelov got us a corner booth table which is my favorite with the lake view of the Bellagio, priceless, with my client Apple iTunes department, I was here for CES 2015. I couldn't be happier.

    Everything was delcious, chef Wilfried Bergerhausen knows what he is doing. My clients were every happy, my best friend loves everything and so did I. The 70 seats Le Cirque was packed every night since chef is on board. This Le Cirque under chef Wilfried is a 2 Michelin Stars in the making. I can't wait to come back.

    The wine list is impressive and the sommelier is so wonderful here. He helped us to choose the perfect wines to pair with our dinner. My group was very happy with the choice. 

   If you want to celebrate your BDAY, anniversary, a promotion, or just because you are loved, Le Cirque Bellagio is a perfect place for you. And tell GM Ivo that you hear this from me :-) You will thank me later :-) Enjoy!",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,14,11,5,U7sXIU4q_ok4Ok11pLlcDg

Food was good, not great.  Wine pairings started off great, but last two were very much misses (maybe because they weren't selected/poured by the somm himself, who was awesome?)  Truly, this is the first bad experience I've had ordering tasting menu w/ pairings from a high end restaurant.  Typically that's the best route to go to allow the chef/somm to show off their best work.  I guess they don't feel they have to prove themselves here anymore?

After watching the documentary about the building and opening of Le Cirque L.Vegas, I really wanted to go check it out for myself the work of Sirio Maccioni.  Just like what I saw on tv, the restaurant was vibrantly and colorfully decorated and I was taking it all in.

We went for dinner at 7:30pm and advised the staff that we had a cirque du soleil show at 10:30pm. They told us delightedly that it will not be a problem, and that they have done the tasting menu for someone in 45 mins before!!

We were seated a little away from the window but still had the view out the window for the Fountain Show. All the wait staff were nice and efficient. We had the tasting menu.  Everything tasted as wonderful as they looked, from the oyster on half shell amuse bouche to the sauteed foie gras, to the seafood and the red meat courses. All the portion were appropriate. 

They even had a surprise b-day trio dessert plated for me!!   Very yummie!! We were done with dinner by 9- 9:30pm.   Overall, I have no complains about the food at Le Cirque, they were all well cooked and great tasting. I guess the little minor detail was the service could be worked on, not that they weren't good but I didn't get the down to earth genuine feel...",o83QcIRyWBznec4Shzg04A,1,0,5,k3-KVvxjqJ5iA_Hdw4_skg

So I used Yelp and choose ""Le Cirque"" thanks to its great ratings.
They are deserved!!
The food was delicious and the place very comfortable knowing that you are on the Strip. 
I would have actually give them 5 stars if rating only the food. But the service was mediocre compared to the rest. The waiters were trying too hard to sell you the most expensive part of their menus. And the 2 French waiters were just purely annoying; being pretentious and anything but nice.

5731406,2017-02-17,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"For my birthday meal I wanted to try some of the food that you always hear about on cooking and travel shows but never want to spend the money.  I found the 5 course meal that had everything I wanted to try at Le Cirque. The price is hefty because in addition to the 135 price the supplement dishes ($35 per ounce on wagyu beef, $40 extra for the black truffle risotto, $60 extra for the caviar).  We decided to skip the caviar but opted for the risotto and wagyu beef and so glad we did.  With drinks and tips the meal came to almost $800 for 2 people.  Definitely the most expensive meal I have ever had to date but well worth the experience. 

First, the staff are friendly and professional.  We arrived early and sat at the bar for drinks. Had a pleasant conversation with the bartender while we waited. The hostess that greeted us and the host that took us to the table were polite.  Our server provided exceptional service though out our meal. Pretty much everyone that came up to the table know their job and they do it well. 

Second, the food.  Along with the 5 courses you are given different dishes in between to transition from certain dish.  There's a rambutan jelly and salmon mouse amuse bouche that's light and fresh.  1st course yellowtail was visually beautiful and it had so many layers taste and texture. 2nd course my bf got the FOIE GRAS while I got the risotto. Both creamy and flavorful with a great after taste. I especially enjoyed the foie gras and the richness of every bite. 3rd course was the sea bass. A flaky piece of fish wrap in a crispy potato.  Text and taste are both on point.   4th course we both ordered the wagyu beef. It was well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and melt in your mouth.  There was the complementary dessert ball filled with a tasty liquid that tasted like apple pie. Our dessert was visually stunning. The raspberry mousse was light and fruity.  The chocolate ball was rich and decadent and a perfect way to finish off the meal. Just when we thought we were done the server brought out some macaroons and candy jelly to push our meal over the top. 

Final review, this is not a place if you are looking to get a heap meal. But you definitely get what you pay for and along with the food you get an experience.   An experience I look forward to doing again.",vfBUFBso--zpOwx3y09QTA,1,0,5,J7yzzbfPmBBIm_USIq7nTw

Everything was outstanding from the food, to the service, to the presentation of the meal. It was also our anniversary that week, and the staff really went out of their way to make us feel special. 

My husband and I arrived and were warmly greeted by the hostess who said Happy Anniversary. Our waiter promptly came over to our table and also said Happy Anniversary. He was very friendly, helpful and thoughtful. He saw me taking photos of everything and volunteered to take our photo without me having to ask. He answered every question we had about the menu. My husband ordered this delicious drink in a big pineapple shaped copper Moscow mule type mug and it came with a macaroon on top. Someone comes over with 4 different kinds of bread for you to pick from. The coffee chocolate bread was to die for! I had seconds it was so good. 

We went with the 3 course prix fixe menu. I ordered the Maryland blue crab with caviar,  the rabbit symphony, and the chocolate molten ball. I was hesitant about getting the crab because it was an extra $65 charge, but the couple next to me talked me into it by saying it was very good. Our waiter asked if I knew there was a supplemental charge before I ordered it, which I knew but I  appreciated it  because sometimes people don't catch everything that is written on the menu. I told my husband he should order the oxtail because it was something we didn't normally have, but he decided against it when our waiter told us it was a supplemental charge. That one I didn't catch, I thought it was only for the ribeye, so I am glad he told us before ordering it. My husband ordered the snails and lamb instead. 

All our food was delicious. Our waiter even told us to have our camera ready to take a video of the crab when it came out when they poured the smoke over it, the presentation was amazing. I was expecting caviar to be really fishy but it was surprisingly not at all. It blended really well with the crab and avocado. My rabbit was very tender and flavorful as well. My chocolate mousse ball with hot  chocolate ganache poured over top of it was another great presentation as well that I got on video. 

I decided I wanted to switch seats with my husband during the meal because I wanted to sit on the long sofa and not a chair and one of the workers was nice enough to give me a pillow  to sit on cause I was a little short for the table. 

We got a copy of the menu signed Happy Anniversary from the executive chef. We also got a complimentary box of truffles and 2 plates of macaroons with some kind of gumdrop.  I also asked our server to take our picture again before we left and he did it without hesitation and until we were satisfied with our photos.

They have a tendency to take you somewhere far away from Vegas through the ambience, the food, the atmosphere.

Le Cirque is a small restaurant that is decorated like the finest circus big top I have ever seen.  They have a monster wine list with a french speaking, well experienced sommolier to match.

It is almost irrelevant in regards to what I had because when you are paying as much as my group paid for the bottles of wine and the food, the staff will do whatever is necessary so you leave satisfied.  My party of three left satisifed having tried a variety of meats with perfectly pair wines to match.

I would say that it is necessary to make reservations.  If you are on a date, don't look at the eye candy that are on the arms of other men.  If you are going to do that bring your own.  The staff is attentive but they also don't want you to waste their time because they are busy.  They are friendly but not indulgent.

Foie gras with kaifer lime and coconut. It sounds a bit odd but the flavor profiles were bold and extremely complimentary to each other. This dish stood out and definitely gives you an idea of the chef's skill at integrating such random ingredients to make such a palatable dish.

Eating this meal was a delicate balance between 'I don't know how much each bite is but I don't care' and 'This is really good so I really, actually just don't care.' Mom, Uncle, and I stopped in on this petite restaurant on a Tuesday evening in June, but I'm here writing this review because it had to be written.

AMBIENCE
If you get seats by the window you have a good view of the Bellagio Fountain and the Paris Eiffel. The lighting and inner decor are reminiscent of an upscale, cozy, inner circus tent. Everything says ""Welcome to our whimsical gastronomic circus, you'll be well taken care of.""

SERVICE
Our meal was hosted by a couple of different maitre ds, one who never introduced the dishes and one who did. I preferred the latter, but other than that service left no room for complaints, perhaps the stray suggestion, and many compliments.

FOOD
5-course meal 
1. Lobster Avocado Salad
2. Foie Gras
3. Sea Bass
4. Lamb 
5  Panna Cotta

Given the chance between 3-course and 5-course, the three of figured ""Well, you know, we're here already so might as well make the most of it."" (The following will be in the order that I preferred the dishes, on a scale of impressed to 'I will never forget about this.') Starting out, the salad had giant chunks of lobster, married well with the buttery avocado. Really fresh taste. Main plate, lamb, was a bit underwhelming after the stellar foie gras and sea bass. Uncle ordered the wagyu beef instead of lamb, which I personally feel wasn't worth the extra $100. The sea bass was dense and flaky, but personally I was more interested in how that glossy wine sauce was made. It didn't have that wine dryness at the back of the throat as many wine sauces do; rather, the well-rounded acidity went with the crisp exterior of the fish like Forest and Jenny Gump.

Now. That kaffir lime bay leaf lemongrass tapioca foie gras was crazy. Probably one of the most amusing things to eat -- there were so many different elements that worked together in that dish. So much praise to the creative person who masterminded this dish, because I would have never thought the bright notes of Southeast Asia would complement the richness of foie gras. What easily gets too rich and difficult to eat, I finished in a heartbeat. French tradition with a twist, this creation gave me the greatest impression of Le Cirque. 

Everything came out beautifully plated, especially the panna cotta. (Now, I had a long internal discussion on which dessert to get because literally everything sounded amazing. Mom went for their famous chocolate ball, and I couldn't help but go for my favorite dessert.) The milky-white jelly came out with beautiful edible flowers and granita lined along the edges of the plate, reminding me of a beach scene, panna cotta washing up against the floral sands. Texturally, this dessert couldn't be beat -- there was the crunch from the granita, softness from the panna cotta, and florals from the flower petals. Delicate and refreshing dessert!

This was my first time in such a highly regarded restaurant. Even though I've been to many fine restaurants, I definitely felt intimidated knowing this was Five Diamonds (you know, the highest rating from a respected institution short of the chefs having Michelin Stars!). What I learned? There was no reason to feel that way- the staff was so warm and accommodating, they made us feel right at home. I really appreciated the fact that they helped us make decisions and were really honest about everything. The waiter even offered to pay for our entrees if we felt disappointed in our choices!

One thing I found remarkable, and perhaps this helps achieve their high rating, was that a member of our party requested a (fairly common) sparkling water which they did not have. The waiter actually had someone from the bar leave the restaurant and acquire some for her. Woh. That right there was mind-blowing to me. 

Their wine list was particularly impressive, but asininely expensive. Expect to pay hundreds of dollars for modest bottles of wine. I'm fairly certain I even saw a bottle listed at around $30,000! I'm sure it was a Lafite Rothschild or something. The sommelier (read: a REAL sommelier) actually complimented my two choices! If that was genuine or not, I don't care. The words ""excellent choices, sir"" actually came out of his mouth. Brownie. Points. Mister. 

Now to the food: everything was excellent. I mean, it was just...excellent! I don't even know what to say beyond that except that my dessert was a ball of ice cream in a spherical shell of chocolate topped with gold leaf (I ate gold!) and had a hot ganache poured over it, thus revealing the dairy insides. 

The decor was so much fun, the restaurant is small and intimate, and if you get the table in the corner on the left when you first enter the dining room, you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from your table!

If you're willing to spend the money, you will not be disappointed in your experience her. It was true Vegas decadence and I loved every minute of it.",EOQRFEwh051glxi4CWboyA,5,5,5,Vc2BTUNgcKLqBHgp2MJaiA
5867925,2015-02-15,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Hearing of its stellar reputation, we made reservations before we got to Vegas. It was as good as the raves - and then some. Not only was the decor lovely and interesting, we enjoyed the dancing fountains every 15 minutes through the windows at the Bellagio Hotel (where the restaurant is located). The staff was abundant and attentive. Even though it was a busy evening, they took time to chat with us about the food, the wine and the environs, along with info about the other locations throughout the world. 
Each course was exquisite in its presentation, its combination of interesting food choices, and of course the mix of amazing flavors. Such a delightful evening for the palate and all the senses! 
I had the venison which came in two medallions impeccably flavored and presented with savory accompaniments. No gaminess there, as we found out their venison is raised in New Zealand especially for their restaurants and is not the kind of deer you would see wandering around the US. 

I could on & on about the food, but it is something you should experience for yourself if you get a chance. Although we dressed nicely, there was a more relaxed dress code than the New York restaurant. The guests around us were also friendly and seemed to be enjoying their time there. All in all, worth every penny - and more - for the wonderful experience.",5ATy9dTuYCfbOJKp8ww3jg,2,2,5,o5YQ14DyFndueuLQpNw_yg
5881579,2016-11-26,1,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,Ate there last night.  Staff was clearly unhappy and that set a poor tone. Kinda snooty.  Good was very good with the notable exception of the Wagyu steak.  I was very disappointed in the quality. No where near the quality and taste I've had in other restaurants.  Definitely not worth the extra $175.,42DynntIbykYrq4MqaEpbA,0,0,3,uSW25vte_7i27vLYGCRz2A
5890720,2015-06-15,0,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"dined pre Cirque du Soleil O! Nice pre-theater menu + wine pairing (~$110 each).  

Our selections:
Course 1- 
Steak tartar w/quail egg- nice dish too much mustard- wine pairing was interesting Grenache rose- though the wine + tartar= too much acid, would have preferred a heavier red
Wife- lobster risotto paired with Chablis- beet risotto was flat out perfect. Cheesy with good chunks of lobster. perfect dish, beet flavor a tad mild.

Course 2- 
seabass- interesting presentation (quasi fried?)- great dish, but the baked/fried coating was unnecessary. paired with uninspiring side. Paired with nice pinot.
Wife- Tenderloin- absolutely cooked to perfection. Essentially melted in your mouth like butter. Paired with a decent but uninspiring cab.

Course 3- 
Raspberry sorbet- delicate but beautiful dish. Paired with port that was just not to my liking.
Chocolate ball- excellent presentation but uninspiring delivery. paired with Riesling that my wife enjoyed.

Overall- Service was excellent and attentive, bread was great, but overall while everything was good, aside from the tenderloin, nothing left us glad we dropped $300 for 2.",OGP5eR9Mz-ouqLtt6DF4zg,0,0,4,CMMwnd2BqYEKjqQur6LWmQ

We had reservations for right after the show. My party of six were dressed in our finest fabric and don't you forget to because this place has a dress code. All the servers were in fine tailored suits. Upon observation that all the servers were male, I asked our ginger server why this was the case, he said that male servers were more aggressive in serving the cliente but that there were two female servers, one on maternity leave and one was cut when the restaurant down sized it staff. He said there were 3 rules to working there:

1) Don't steal
2) Don't make mistakes 
3) Don't call in sick

Point taken, I'm hiring all males for my restaurant. ;)

The menu is quite confusing, especially the gustation taste menu. You get many choices and some no choice at all. The items are separated by a maroon & symbol or an ""or"". Regardless, ask for help and clarification...you end up getting a six course meal, given the little oyster bonus they bring out.

The lobster salad was refreshing, the sauteed foie gras rich decadence, the seabass was in excess, I could have done without, the duck was outstanding, and the train desserts were heavenly. We played musical desserts at our table. And they also gave the women in our group parting boxes of chocolate truffles!",tB8K22NTv8HXHysFnyrYqw,5,4,5,s_AoVcUeqY8T91zDj5cOUA

ATMOSPHERE: Festive, fun, but very high class and hoitty toitty.  The crowd was very conservative looking and everyone spoke at a whisper.   

FOOD: Amazing! The salad was clean-tasting, perfectly seasoned, and the lobster was uber-fresh and perfectly cooked.  The filet mignon with foie gras was melt in your mouth delicious, even though I like my steaks cooked medium-well (I know, but get over it).  Finally, the pear souffle was cooked to perfection and tasted like silk!    

PRICE: 98 clams for a three course prix-fixe is not bad considering the quality of the food, the pitch-perfect service and the fact that this is Vegas.  Their wine list was very comprehensive and quite impressive.  For those who don't care to spend $5K on a bottle of DRC, you can get a 750 of Papapietro Perry for about 100 bucks ... not too shabby.   

SERVICE: Absolutely perfect! The maitre-d, server, sommelier, and bus-boys were attentive but not over-bearing.  The sommelier shared an interesting story about the paintings on the walls, and when I informed our server that they failed to remove the twine from my filet, they immediately took it back and brought out a re-plated entree.     

CONCLUSION:  If you're in Vegas and you want to splurge a bit, I highly recommend Le Cirque.  The food ws great, but what sets this place apart is the impeccable service. Oh, and the little truffles they leave you with (in the cool red boxes) are a really nice touch!",t775KUuWRXlTzYenSSvwHg,0,0,4,x0-LZtOEV5ptyKd31QKhCg
5982205,2017-05-02,3,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"The ""prime beef"" hangar steak was completely inedible. It was so tough that the provided steak knife should have been replaced with an electric hedge trimmer. 
The service and all of the other courses were definitely 5 star, the food flavourful and expertly prepared and service efficiently delivered. 
But it remains incomprehensible that a Michelin starred restaurant would even think of serving, and perhaps even improperly prepare, an oftentimes tough cut of beef to its customers. Why take the risk in serving a relatively inexpensive cut of beef in a restaurant of this renown?
It should be acknowledged that the uneaten beef was removed from the cheque.",-0GfW6bw64XRcI6fWvUQ6g,0,0,2,iRNHStryo6bWwFszyIR4yg
5993565,2011-09-14,2,rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w,"Wow wow...We had dinner after the 7:30 O show ended.  I wasn't really expecting it to be this great.  I really don't like super french over the top food, because some times, I feel like there is too much fluff and not enough substance.  However this place is fluff and full of substance.  

It was late so I only ordered one thing (and I was hesitant about eating here) so I ordered:Filet de Loup De Mer, wrapped in crispy potato. Oh my God, was it good!  It was just memorable....perfect all the way around.

My boyfriend ordered: The lobster salad and the lamb chop. Again, Oh my God, delicious!

His cousin ordered the Roasted chicken. It was sublime.  Moist, perfectly season and cooked.  It comes with a truffle sauce, she doesn't like truffle, but she wanted to bathe herself with it after the first taste.  

For dessert we ordered:
Some sort of chocolate filled thing.  When it arrived at the table, we were confused as to how to eat it, (because its a ball, a large ball) then, the waiter pours a chocolate sauce on top of it, and the ball start melting rather quickly, like magic! It was incredible good.

It was expensive, we spent almost $380 (including tip, if I remember correctly, it could be more) for: one glass of champagne, one salad, (lobster salad that is) and three main entrees. 

So this place is not suitable for penny pinches!  You will not like it, trust me.  I know you people only like food based on price, so erase this place from your mind. You'll hate it! 

But I think there is a pre-fix menu for less than $70 before the 7;30 show.  Don't know how good it is, but I guess, if bargains are your thing, then try it.",1mI_WcnyKUfTX10XNey_AA,3,3,5,0qQHfvWmSb7TAFnDEj9EbQ
