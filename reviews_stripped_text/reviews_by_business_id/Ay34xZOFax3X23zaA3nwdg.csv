3879,2017-03-13,0,Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg,Stopped in today for lunch. Every previous experience has been great. Today was terrible. I walked in and sat down. The waitress kept on looking at my table and walking to other tables around me. After about 10 minutes the waitress asked if I was waiting for someone and I said no that I was alone. I ordered some water and she brought me some and the menu. I was ready to order right away and as I was talking to her she turned and walked away. I sat and waited as other patrons came in and sat down. The owner tended to them and the same waitress brought them their drinks and began to take their orders. I kept on waiting patiently for her to stop by but she proceeded to clear empty tables as well as ask other tables about their meals and if they needed anything.  After 25 minutes I decided to leave since nearly half of my lunch hour had passed with no true service.,_O9uuFfVgUSwuoTa9Vb4fQ,3,0,1,Bk0lUP8FuJhwvwuUETKr3Q

However, we ALWAYS come here to order up their very good selection of Italian meats and cheeses.  They offer fine quality mortadella, salami, capicola, soppresata, provolone ... I could go on and on.  We haven't found anyplace in Las Vegas to match their selection or quality.  

I would have given them five stars, but they could use a little more gusto in their customer service.

344474,2012-02-19,0,Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg,"You have a few different types of Italian food. There's the food you get at your average big name restaurant, there's these gourmet type places and then there is the kind of food you get when you go over to your friends house and his grand mother cooks the dinner, you know what I mean the real stuff. That's the kind of food you get at Roma Deli, the real deal authentic stuff. I've gone here a few times with an Italian friend of mine. 

When we go there he walks in speaking Italian and everyone is greeting each other and so on. It's not such a big place but they also have a little area outside that you can relax at. Its clean and usually busy when I've been there. 

Now the thing I love about this place is the atmosphere. Roma Deli is family operated and I think 3 generations work in the place. It's the kind of deli you see in the movies that you would expect in Brooklyn, the place everyone knows to go to eat. I believe this is more a reflection of authenticity then say bad service. There aren't really waiters wondering around. Instead as my friend showed me, when you want something you just shout it out and it's there. Some people might be turned off by this because we are taught in America mostly that such things are rude. But I found that only added to the appeal of the place. It's more like being in this guys house at dinner then a stuffy restaurant. 

The food is delicious. I've had the lasagne and the Sicilian sandwich and I've never tasted anything that compares to that sandwich. This isn't food trucked in from the supermarket but real homemade food. The food gets a 5 from me. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because I love my soda and free refills.

The mussels had barely any ""meat"" and where some were absolutely delicious there were a few of them that were rather ""fishy"" tasting....if that makes any sense.  Anyhow, I didn't quite finish and hope to please my taste buds with dessert and an espresso.

I then asked for the tiramisu and I swear it was one of the best of its kind I ever had.  No it was the best slice of tiramisu I've had.  Overall my experience was 3.5 stars.

The only thing that tasted good was the ciabatta bread which was fresh. The tiramisu was bad it tasted more like water or watered down. I think they used water instead of coffee just weird that I would taste water in tiramisu. 
Either way it tasted nasty, never had a bad tiramisu like that specialy at an italian restaurant. 
It feels more like a grocery store inside maybe they should just stick to selling produce instead of serving food. 
Dont know how they get all those great reviews about their food but trust me having eaten at real italian restaurants in europe and being familiar with the taste, this didnt taste nothing like italian. Either those people who eat there have no clue how italian food should taste or they dont have any taste.

I discovered it during a work lunchbreak, it was crazy busy, but the food was wonderful.  The bread...oh the bread!!  I had remembered a friend said this place has the best meatball sandwich he has had in his life.  I have never ordered meatballs before, but I gave it a try.  Delicious, and I'm a foodie at heart.  My girlfriends at work and I started coming here for lunch.

I took my boyfriend here for dinner, and it was a completely different atmosphere, just like the perfect hole in the wall Italian place that you dream of finding in North Beach in the Bay area.  My now husband, when he was in town, would always want to come here.  We love it! 

And we've tried a lot of the food.  My fave is always the spaghetti and meatballs, which I get with angel hair and a side of capers.  It is divine.  The house salad is absolutely wonderful with their homemade dressing. My husband has tried all different dishes on the menu, and it is always great.  And if it's close to closing, sometimes they'd send us home with an entire grocery bag of fresh bread.  

Now that I've moved to California to be with my husband, we have searched high and low for this place (or a near second).  We are still looking.  Not even in North Beach have we found its equal!! So much, that a yr later, I had a friend driving through from Vegas, bring me 10 servings of my dish to have frozen, and they sent her with a ton of free bread too.  

I wish this restaurant were near my home.  It has captured both our appetites and our hearts.  It's hidden treasure in Vegas, that has yet to be discovered.",yD9XUzpHAIpv3KkiWzLGYQ,0,0,5,Z5msa9xoIw5VYrDqGHdpeg

Yesterday, as part of my ""NFL Day "" planning, since I was on Spring Mountain to buy apple fritters from Ronald's for my gf, I opted to buy sammies at Dakao and Roma.

when I walk into Roma, only one other customer who also had a to-go order.  I opt for a sammie of  sausage and peppers adding eggs and a meatball sub. total cost $19.

I have to ding the guys one star - it took over 20 minutes to prepare the food - why ?? the place was empty ! 

As far as the taste - the meatball sammie was very good, tender, flavorful and decent serving size.

The sausage sammie also good but not quite as good as the meatball.  A personal preference, I like the peppers ( and onions ) softer, not crunchy.  I think a couple sprinkles of parmesan would've helped, too.

I'm still a fan of Roma

1340247,2018-01-25,0,Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg,"Inside Roma Deli Restaurant Café, every square table has an elaborate map of Italy. If you look to the right, you will be delighted to see the great Pinocchio. Also there is an intricate mural of the Ruins of the Roman Forum which captivates a pivotal moment in Italian History. The restaurant is very spacious and clean. You can watch TV, just know that it is primarily focus on tennis as this is a favorite Italian sport. They do have a deli and bakery section and everything is freshly made. Now when you are dining in, the atmosphere feels light-hearted and it will put you in a jovial mood while listening and rockin' to the best songs of the 80s.

It's amazing how this restaurant creates the best kind of Authentic Italian Cuisine. For my order, I chose the Gnocchi Your Way ($15) with chicken ($3) and spinach. Gnocchi is a soft dough, it is similar to a dumpling but it's rolled and cut into small pieces. Given a choice of Pesto, Alfredo, or Bolognese, the recommendation I was told is to combine the Pesto and Alfredo for Gnocchi. In doing so, the unique blend of two different sauce will make the dish very creamy and full of flavor. They bring a small basket of freshly baked warm bread and butter that you can enjoy as a snack or with your meal. 

As soon as the Gnocchi is serve, I am thrilled how soft, savory, and delicious Gnocchi taste. The meal is so good! The chicken breast is cut into strips and the meat is tender. The sauce is very creamy, you can even take a piece of bread to sponge some of that sauce and enjoy it. For dessert, I chose the Cherry Panna Cotta ($6) which is an Italian cream pudding. Its texture taste almost similar to a soft custard and with the addition of fruit and cherry sauce, it elevates the wonderful flavor of this simple dessert. One of the greatest thing about having a Cherry Panna Cotta is that it makes me smile. The service is outstanding. Becka and Boba have been so kind and attentive, they made me feel welcomed. This truly is the best Italian restaurant.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,2,0,5,OGMNnEabTgBmXMxklaHaBw

The menu is very different. The stuffed peppers (our prior fav) have been changed to be stuffed with sausage and breading. No longer gluten free.

We ordered four different items. The Pappardelle with willd mushrooms sounded so good. How a chef can take a dish usually made with a delicate oil, wine herbs and mushrooms and destroy it with a heavy red sauce is beyond me. The sauce was terrible and mushrooms gritty. It was inedible. The lasagne was just terrible. The risotto was ok. The only good item was the salad with buratta.

After taking two little bites of my pappardelle I just gave up. It was a huge portion and obvious that I hadn't eaten it. Rather than sending it back I just left it.

The pricing is moderate but the portions and quality are worth it. Usually a fairly good selection of music playing (well beyond the generic 'best of' Dean Martin selection, though enjoyable, is fairly stereotypical of many local joints) and with two mid size tv's you can find whatever the general sporting event of the moment is.

They do offer takeout and delivery, and dine-in does include table service for dinner.

Their chicken or eggplant parm sandwiches are heavenly, with fresh bread, tons of gooey cheese, and a large portion. The calamari salad is a bit plain, but fresh, so I tend to go for the greek- add chicken if this is intended as a meal.

Downside to this location is the parking situation- I often come by to a full lot and have to pull out on the busy street, turn into another adjacent lot, repark, and walk over.

I have spent three times as much on the strip to eat at the finest Italian and this place was as good.
The service is good, the dining room is old school, it's like a deli, you actually get real Italians telling you buonasera and not asking you every five seconds how is everything and not telling you "" Prego , prego "" instead of "" buon appetite "" when they bring you a plate.

From what I read in the net, there are new owners, some famous poker  players , Todd Brunson , Fabio and a Italian Max Pescatori, the chef Leonardo also partner is Italian , they are lucky to have him ,  he is cooking from his heart , it's simple, tasty, straighforward, authentic.

You can see they are trying hard to transform a place that was already a good place to go , they want to make it a more authentic Italian place.

Hurry , guys , go there , they will make it, I bet in two years , they will be renting half of that mall. I hope  they keep their new enthousiasm and I wish them the best of luck.

Recently my uncle and I stopped in for dinner at Roma's and I have to say that I left very impressed with the food and the service. I ordered a shredded chicken pasta with peppers and onions and it was perfect. The sauce was spicy enough and the portion was generous. We were given a generous basket of fresh bread before our main dishes came out. Overall, it was the best Italian dinner I ever had in Vegas.  

The management of this restaurant/deli is exceptional. The owner (Massimo) came out to talk with us and was very professional and personable. The atmosphere is intimate and ""hometown"" feeling, not at all like what chain restaurants feel like. The location is a bit out of the way down in Chinatown, so I can see how most people miss this place if they are staying somewhere on the strip, however I would say it is worth the drive to eat here instead of the bland, overpriced, and overrated food you can get on the strip.

This restaurant had a very ""local"" feel about it. In a good way. In one corner was a young man and woman on what appeared to be their first date, in the other corner was a two of Las Vegas' finest eating as well, and then of course there was the large Italian family at the long table enjoying their night as well. It really had a cozy feel to it. At the end when the bill came, I was delighted to see that it wasn't overpriced either.  

Overall, I would not hesitate to come back to Roma's. In fact, I will request that we go back anytime I am in town. It was that good.",RvXTDScB01DbDaV7XOuE-w,2,1,5,UH8oynAlW1EjB69qwrLa4g

I tried to order a veal Parmesan sandwich for professional poker player Jeff Lisandro. They, for whatever reason, do not carry it anymore.

Instead, we opted to order two chicken Parmesan sandwiches and a breaded veal chop.

Instead, we got a normal veal chop; unbreaded and not fried; definitely not parmigiana either.

I confirmed the order with Becca twice, so I'm not sure where the lost in translation occurred as it was pretty dead.

I shoulda checked to make sure once it was ready, but c'mon!

We went here for a Sunday family dinner because Cugino's and Monte Sanos are closed on Sundays. Well, next time I want a good home cooked Italian meal on Sunday, I will wake my butt up early and do it myself before I come here again. 
They did have some products imported from Italy, many things you wont see elsewhere. But overall, it was just ok. 
We had raviolis, chicken marsala, chicken parm, and I also started with an olive salad. 
The salad was way too oily. The meat sauce on my ravioli left a layer of grease that I felt all night long.

There are always people speaking Italian that it starts to feel as though you are in Italy dinning in a deli. 

Their staff is always friendly with big smiles on their face and that Italian courtesy. They will go well and beyond to make sure that your dinning experience goes swimmingly. 

As far as food goes, I loved their seafood specials! It changes constantly, but the ones I've been fortunate enough to eat were phenomenal! The sauce is always flavorful and creamy, but not thick or watery. You can definitely tell that their food is as close as it will get to the real Italian food from Italy. Pair your meal with their selection of wines and you'll feel like you've gone to heaven. The kicker is their homemade desserts! Be sure to end your wonderful food-gasmic experience with their delightful selection of sweets to go well with their cappuccino.

to start they always offer some fresh bread and butter. i usually order a plate of different olives

portions are for 1 and half person

their desserts are homemade as well. 
i love their pana cotta with red berries or their tiramisu with REAL Mascarpone.

you won't eat Italian elsewhere once you try Roma Deli!

(I forgot her name) However, the last two times i've dined at this establishment, I noticed discrimination by the owner when it comes to giving the same treatment to his customers that are Caucasian. When they walk through the door, he greets them, seat them, and check on them. 

However, I did not receive the same treatment. I had to seat myself, sat for a while and have to give an uncomfortable stare for someone to assist me. Once, I was served, no one checked on me to see how I was doing until I had to do it again to get the server attention. My friend also noticed the last time we came which was last week, the owner was giving him an uncomfortable stare while we were dining in. 

It's unfortunate that I'm writing about this and I have never felt this way at any business until now. I really enjoy the food there but I or anyone else should not feel this way especially if i'm a repeat customer, pay and tip just like everyone else.

I felt the presentation was lacking, the service was slow even though they were not very busy, the quality was ok, but nothing special. Nothing I could not have made at home for far less money.

I don't drink and had my brother with me. We did nor order a lot, he had some juice, I had a lemon water. I ordered a caprici salad, chicken parma which came with a side of ziti. My brother had spaghetti and meatballs. Our rather ordinary food came up to $65.00 before tip!

If the food was amazing I would have been fine with the bill but it was not. I'd put it about the same quality as a Frizolli or one of those Italian chains in a Mall food court. 

If we had gone to a Johnny Carinno's or even Olive Garden it would have been better and cheaper. 

For a place that touts itself as authentic Italian, with a faux Italian market and deli they could have done so much better without a lot of effort. I liked the other location and may try them again but will not be back to this one.",bWavcIJp3L3aTCH82y6bRA,2,0,3,R-m2rosPPv9g07h7fre9Wg

First off, the selection of meats and cheeses is impressive.  And the quality of the salame in my sandwich was impressive.

My friend wanted a salad and none of the options appealed to her.

We walked in and stood there, waiting for someone - anyone - to tell us to seat ourselves or wait or go to the counter.... We finally took a seat, and, after about 4 minutes, a lady said ""oh, order over there.""   So we walked up to the counter.  At which time we were told we were at the wrong counter.  So we went to the ""other"" counter - the salad and sandwich counter, apparently.  There were tip jars on every counter and little direction.  The beverage selection was paltry, though not as limited as the one flavor of potato chips.

Yes, there's a feeling of authenticity.  Yes, the bread is fresh - but that roll was bigger, harder and more difficult to digest than any I've had in recent times.  We heard lots of Italian being spoken and I liked the truly local vibe this place exuded.

We ended up here after asking the valet at our hotel for a local, off the strip restaurant.... He looked like he was about to drool when he recommended Roma, so we had to try it.

I think I'd have rather paid $15 for a sandwich at Carnegie Deli on the strip...  Oh well.  I'm glad I checked it out.  And, hey, there's an autographed picture of Celine Dion on the wall - and if it's good enough for Celine, it should be good enough for me.

Most Vegas residents and tourists that visit the Spring Mountain Rd. corridor is familiar with the dominant Asian Foodie scene. After reading reviews of this place, I finally got the chance to try this place out.

From the moment you walk in, you'll notice the simple and straightforward layout of the place. About a dozen table and chairs with a cool laminated table top with the map of Italy. The table tops got my attention and it was an interesting guide to the different regions of Italy. Great way to keep anyone occupied as you wait for your delicious food being prepared. 

Onto the food, everything was simply prepared to what one would expect from an authentic Italian restaraunt. This place exceeded my expectations from the quality and consistent flavor of each dish. Especially the Meatballs and the Linguine with Shrimp and Mushrooms with pink sauce. I would come back for these two dishes. My only compliant was the wait staff, it seemed they were under staff but the service was still reasonable despite the wait and our server was very friendly and accommodating plus she was pregnant.

FYI: 
Don't forget to checkout the Bakery items in the display case torward the rear part of the restaraunt. They also have various items on one side of the wall  kinda like a mini Italian market.

I don't have a lot of experience with authentic Italian food (other than knowing I want to put it in my face) but we went with an Italian friend from Chicago who said the place looked pretty legitimately italian, and saw a bunch of stuff she liked on their deli shelves. 

We went on a Sunday night, so the restaurant was not crowded. The service that we got was very good, our waitress was helpful and attentive! When a member of our table asked if she could put a soccer game on the tv she was really nice and put the game on for us (in Spanish, like he requested). They were very accommodating! 

Everyone at our table enjoyed their dishes. My husband got the Sicilian lasagna with eggplant and loved his dish. I ordered fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. The sauce was good, it was a little oily, but the chicken was absolutely delicious. I don't know if it was a marinade or something they used on it, but it was delicious. 

I wasn't planning on ordering dessert, because a few yelp reviews had said they weren't good - but for once I am so glad that I didn't listen to the reviews!

The noodles and cheese was overpowered easily by the over abundance of meat sauce. Beyond greasy! Have notice the quality of food going down each year. Staff and service is great!

I used to bring clients here for lunch, it was always a treat for them and a delight for me to see how much my guests enjoyed making the discovery.
Mossimo the owner offers uthentic Roman prepared Italian dishes just as if one were in Rome. Their lasagna is incredibly delicious (Roman style).  I sometimes would order and bring an entire take away pan or pans of lasagna to clients offices (1 pan served about 20) at Christmastime, along with rolls, salads and delicious Italian cookies.
Their breads are their own baked and some of the best anywhere. I believe that they have their own bakery off premises and that they supply breads to many local eateries.   Assorted Italian charcuterie, delicious salads, Italian cookies and subs.  Their pizza is really good as well.
I'm thinking that the place has changed hands but I'm unsure.  Things look a bit different.  I miss visiting this place as I used to come here pretty regularly with clients.  Ciao!  I hope that your experience is a good as mine.",eVpEgqXaVPXgN0qVFxJpGQ,0,0,4,iLhHDHi0vC5shvz4Sb88bA

Even when they're not really full they seem to have trouble keeping up with orders in a timely manner.

Food is decent, but nothing to talk about. The main reason I went there was to try their lasagna since this is one of the few places in town that makes the real deal with bechamel sauce instead of the sacrilegious Americanized ricotta recipe like most other places. My excitement melted away after the first few bites. It was OK, but far from memorable. Sorry my fellow citizens, but if you're looking for the real deal the closest best lasagna is in L.A. The other stuff I tried was also OK, but not worth the trip.

Deli department is just average, fuhgeddaboudit... You may want to check out Bagel Cafe or some other place.

As a former New Yorker, I'm sure my review is biased, but if you have any idea what a good NY style Italian deli is about or good homemade Italian food, you will be underwhelmed.",-g-x5DiRxV0rXCyFkfhU3A,5,3,2,UqgIqtWHyU6XXk9qnGgyOQ

On their board of lunch specials they had braciole (with rigatony)! Score! I've been looking for an Italian restaurant that serves this dish and what better place? So I'll admit it.. I got the pasta AND an Italian sandwich. And I might have eaten half of my sister's sandwich.. what? She offered. 

The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente (although the brand itself wasn't my favorite.. a little chalky), the sauce obviously homemade and the braciole itself was tender and had little surprises hidden throughout- raisins, pinenuts. It was heavenly.

The sandwich.. oh man. The sandwich. Fresh baked roll, Italian meats sliced to order, shredded lettuce, fresh tomato, provolone, oil and vinegar. A thing of simplicity. A thing of perfection ($7.49). My sister ordered the imported prosciutto sandwich with fresh mozzarella and roasted red peppers. This too, was amazing. This came on pillowy but chewy ciabatta whose mere aroma seduced me. The creamy mozzarella with the slightly bitter and bold roasted peppers and the salty meatiness that is proscuitto.. this too was a great sandwich ($11.49).

Plus it was just down the road from the major grocery stores in chinatown. The front parking lot is small but we went just as they opened so it was not so busy. We also found that there is a back parking lot for customers.
 As you walk in Roma it has a deli counter where you can make sandwiches or buy prepared items like mac salad, green olives, calamari salad. The restaurant portion has one long table for a big group and several small seating and the there are shelves with products for sale. We were seated quickly, and they brought the whole specials board down to us to show us the specials. I guess that is a normal practice since everyone that walked in for the restaurant got shown the board.
I like that as we waited for our meal we could see the deli counter. We will definetly be back to try the sandwiches.  The bread looks nice and crisp, vegetables are cut fresh instead of prepackaged cut veggies and you can get sandwiches with roasted bell peppers. On the deli counter menu I also saw pizza dough on sale. You can buy the toppings there and make your own pizza at home. Awesome idea since the have such a variety of cheeses and meats. I am looking forward to going back to try it. 
Back to what i actually ordered
Calamri salad-excellent. Fresh and not fishy tasting or rubbery. Got the garlic bread and it was crunchy but not tough or chewy.
Chicken parmigian-cant go wrong wirh breaded chicken with cheese and sauce. Three pieces was one portion. The pasta came on the side which was a good touch but it was too al dente for me.  The flavor was good though and i ate it up. 
We ate the dishes family style.
We were actually full but had to taste the dessert so we had tiramisu and the ""grandmother cake"". Tiramisu had the consistency of tres leches, overly soaked bottom layer and then the creamy top with coffee flavor. Taste was there just different from what i expected. The grandmother cake was a pastry pie with a lemony, nutty, custard type filling. That i found very delicious.
Anyway...this review is long because it was just an overload of things to see and eat. The menu is relatively simple but it just has great quality products.",sYSRSJVuZcLEM-_kQfIRNw,2,2,4,YhaENn3cyolea9-9DDverg

The ambiance? Well, there isn't any. This isn't the place I'd go for romance (not that I wanted romance with my buddy in the desert!) . It's like eating in the middle of a market. The deli case dominates. Coolers with sodas. Olive oil and pasta along the walls.

Really REALLY good chicken parm.

We came for dinner with Mom and grandma in law. It's sometimes hard to figure out what everyone would like with different taste and everyone's answer is ""anything"" is good with them.....

So I pulled out something I bookmarked at random and it was a good choice.

They give you bread and while I was dipping it into oil and balsamic I had the idea to go to the deli part of the place and ask for some accompaniments. I ended up going for the ""olive salad"" which was big green olives tossed with cornichons, peppers, celery, herbs. I LOVE green olives with ""bite"" so I was a happy camper stealing everyone's foccacia bread. 

BF and I shared like usual. Pork chop milanese was perfectly cooked and juicy and even the simple red sauce on the pasta that it comes with was lovely....simple things are hard to do because nothing is hiding mistakes. We also got the rigatoni basciola which has sausage, mushrooms, peas, with a tomato wine sauce. This had a nice balance of flavors and definitely would order again. 

Mom and gma shared a meaty lasagna. I tried a bite and it was very meaty and good. They thought it needed more sauce....I think to American standards, it does since we're so used to sauce sauce sauce. I thought it's flavors was good. 

We got some desserts. I shared with the BF some cookies: almond butter cookie, chocolate sprinkle butter cookie, a florentine cookie, a rainbow marzipan cookie, a nutella shortbread cookie and a cannoli. The cannoli had a banana taste to the filling. It wasn't bad, but wasn't what I was expecting....I just wanted the ricotta milkiness to come through. Florentines are one of my favorite things and though the texture was nice, it was freezerburnt tasting so I was sad panda. The butter cookies are okay. The highlight was the rainbow ""cookie"" which really is rainbow colored cake and marzipan dipped in chocolate. Theirs was nicely made and I have been craving these, but they're usually only available on holidays. I bought some of the rainbow cookies to take home. 

Service was very attentive and friendly....the place has a very homey feel which I like.  I didn't realize the profile didn't have lots of pictures....what a bust- I should have tried to take some.

My friend and I often go around 11 am and it's never usually busy there. We always get greeted right away on top of that, which is always awesome. 

I have to say that we are utterly addicted to their pastas. We have gone to Roma about three times now. We have never been disappointed at all with their food nor service. One of the servers actually recognized me after the first time we went and she already knows that I'm on a time crunch so she tends to get our food out quick! I absolutely adore her! 

The first time, we had their chicken cacciatore pasta with bell peppers and with a spicy red sauce. Unfortunately, the sauce wasn't as spicy and I would've liked it to be and it was a little more on the tangy side due to it being a tomatoe based sauce. However, it was still very delicious and the pasta was perfectly al dente, which is how we LOVE our pasta. The pasta also came with some garlic bread, which was delicious!

We have also tried both their Italian and Sicilian sandwiches. It was pretty decent. The only thing I don't really care for is their bread. It's kind of hard ): 

Their penne pasta with salmon and spinach in vodka sauce was so good. The salmon were chunks and cooked PERFECTLY. It had the BEST texture -- not too dry nor too raw.  

Then in our most recent visit, we tried their fettuccine with sausage ragu in a tomatoe cream sauce ... and it has been my FAVORITE dish so far at Roma. It was DELICIOUS. We couldn't stop eating it! I can't really describe it aside from it being yummy goodness all over. It's also one of the dishes that they offer all the time because it's too popular for them to take off! 

Awesome Italian food right in the middle of all these Asian places .. definitely a surprise!

HUMANITARIANS and fellow VEGETARIAN'S TAKE NOTE

1. Ordered a VEGETARIAN lasagna get all the way home only to find they gave me an eggplant instead. 

2. Returned and even ordered something extra to help balance their loss which was their fault to begin with but hey, we are all human and make mistakes. I choose to give others opportunities to improve themselves. Driving away I check bag and Massimo forgot to add the dessert.

3rd and final MAJOR screw up!

Once again I order a VEGETARIAN lasagna, I get all the way home and am excited for dinner and take 1st bite only to spit it right out. They screwed up yet again and gave me a MEAT lasagna and I have not had any meat, chicken etc for over 35 years. 

I call and Massimo picks up the phone and asked how I paid for it then stepped away for a bit to ask kitchen about order to see if it was kitchens fault or his fault and comes back and says bring it back but didn't mention who's fault it was.

I drive all the way across town and bring the MEAT lasagna back and experienced attitude completely uncalled for by Massimo who conceitedly tried to blame me and said ""he thought it was REALLY FUNNY this has happened 2 times."" 

I remained patient throughout his unprofessional tantrum and politely said ""no, Massimo, it has happened 3 times as you also forgot part of my order the last time and you now think it's funny that you served meat to a vegetarian who has not had meat in over 35 years? I said ""do you know how this feels?"" Massimo sarcastically said ""no, I'm not a vegetarian and showed minimal remorse or compassion for their screw ups.

Massimo you should be ashamed of yourself and consider taking a trip someplace and regrouping yourself as this type of behavior to any human being is completely uncalled for. Your  poor attitude and lack of morals was uncalled for and not appreciated.

 I REFUSE to reward poor behavior and it is unfortunate I am forced to give you even 1 star and assure you I will NEVER set foot or recommend Roma's to others. 

If you select at top ""view reviews by lowest rated"" you will clearly see from other YELP reviewers this poor and conceited customer service is not out of the ordinary. 

To get that angry over a few slices of pasta, eggplant and sauce that probably cost you a few dollars out of pocket for YOUR mistake is truly pitiful.

Chicken cacciatore is so delicious.  Next time I'm saving room for dessert.   Even my husband who grew up in NY loves it here.  Can't wait to come back....

I've been to this location and the one on Sahara, personally I like Roma deli 2 a little better, it's busier, closer to my house and the overall vibe of the place although this one doesn't disappoint. They have a mini market if you will with a nice deli selection and the desserts are on point. Tonight I ordered the linguini with clams in a white wine sauce, I was in heaven! The dish was very flavorful, the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the clams tasted amazing not to mention the amount you get in the dish I sopped up the sauce with the crispy French bread mmmmm. I highly recommend but just know that it's a bit on the pricey side so bring your mula.",xzLpOmG-9TRpAp8Wd6HLSA,0,0,4,Epzd233ajVUXpzZa1n6LjQ

5767182,2013-10-05,1,Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg,"Welcome to Italy or at least our own little slice of it. Forget the Venetian and it faux decor. This is the real thing. This shop has a vibe unlike any other Italian restaurant I have been in. Doubling as an Italian deli the restaurant itself sells quality Italian food at wallet friendly prices. The food here is what I'd expect a home cooked meal to taste like... If I was an Italian... In Italy. The portions are very generous, and the food itself is always freshly cooked and delicious. 

Furthermore, the service is top notch. You feel as though you've stepped once again into an Italian household invited to dinner. The workers due their utmost in providing the best service with a smile and a few jokes at that. 

The deli serves some of the best Italian cold cuts from various types of prosciutto and capicolla. They also serve a delicious assortment of cheeses and cold dishes. 

Coming here you are welcomed into the heart of Italy. From food at the table to the food sold at the deli you can't go wrong. The service is top notch and the restaurant is very clean. So if your looking for some great Italian food, you don't have to look so far.",SlCXIWAYwL_itoM_gHuzQw,2,3,5,wo-ERW-KeMPYNsshPoAALQ
5771811,2015-07-14,0,Ay34xZOFax3X23zaA3nwdg,I've been to Roma at least 10 times while visiting Vegas. I used to love this place but recently the food has gone from excellent to fair in my opinion. Calamari salad is too tangy and salty and so are many of the pasta dishes. The chef need to tone down on the salt. Desserts are still good. I probably will find a better Italian food in Vegas next time I'm here.,d3ypnBp6yDHWShML-9k5Ng,0,0,3,fA-dN--Fv8Yu3NdmdIll-A

In Iceland we don't have Italian restaurants.  But if we did I would like them all to be like the Roma Deli.

The owners are the nicest folks, the patrons are real Italians with guns tucked in their belts and parole officers waiting in the car, and the food is outstanding.

I hesitate to make this review in fear that it might change this place because it's like our little hideaway place off the beaten path, it's never crowded, always a friendly staff, great authentic food, great service, and great prices. I have been living in Vegas for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed at this restaurant. 
They also have great authentic italian cookies, prepared deli items and many favorite italian grocery items in their deli section. The place reminds me of the old ""little Italy"" neighborhood places where I grew up back east.",g2G2iCVo6hXpYbf2silskw,0,0,5,4w1EWEbjSgj7msk6X3b4KA

Order: 
Calamari - Delicious!

My overall experience here was warming and enjoyable. Plenty to choose from and yummy food too! They have a store side/deli and a dessert section too -- I will be trying that side during my next visit.",yFpmlk4flcdeIx7bAorSHA,1,1,5,v7QMrnSigKmCLZ7thopmkw

the service was horrible... she actually never came back after dropping off the food... while she was there i asked for a cup of sauce of which i never received. someone else went and got our bill.....
the food itself... well the chicken parm was ok nothing to write yelp about but ok... however the meatball parm was horrible.... it lit tasted like those stuffed raviolis from chef boyardee 

all in all i wouldnt rec this place, and i wont be going back.

The food is AMAZING, out of this world delicious, cooked to perfection. They will always accommodate special requests. The new vegetarian lasagna left me speechless it was soooo yummy. The staff is also great, courteous and quick. Love the family vibes, they always make you feel right at home. 

In addition to a satisfying dinner they have an amazing espresso bar. The cappuccino makes a perfect pair with their handmade deserts. The cannoli and tiramisu are the best I've ever had. I've wanted to try other desserts but, I just can't leave without that cannoli. LOL

They also go above and beyond on service for special occasions. My boyfriend took me here on Valentines Day knowing it is one of my favorite local eateries and they had transformed the restaurant with beautiful table clothes and even gave out long stem roses to each couple.

You might find a fantastic Italian meal at an expensive restaurant in the city, but the West Coast is conspicuously lacking the neighborhood delis that the East Coast so enjoys.

So it was a very pleasant surprise to find Roma while on a trip to Las Vegas.  This place is the real deal.  They serve fantastic sandwiches (I got the sausage and peppers) and have wonderful Italian desserts.  They even have a small grocery section so locals and buy the right pasta, tomatoes, and olive oils for real Italian cooking.  You won't see a can of Hunts crushed tomatoes here!

Also, I ran into Jerry Lewis here.  Random.",5dtr_H7wFyq1rJN5Ud4PQg,0,0,4,HybLFGuqw_0J9hPrnOT8Yg

Their desserts, deli counter and breads are always fresh and plentiful, so it's a good place to pick up food to go.

I'm not a big pasta eater, but they cook their pasta well and all the dishes I have had here have been delicious. Some of my favorites are the linguini with clams, eggplant parm sandwich and many of their lunch and dinner specials are outstanding as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,7,5,eavJEU59h2gzsvg9tTYRIg
