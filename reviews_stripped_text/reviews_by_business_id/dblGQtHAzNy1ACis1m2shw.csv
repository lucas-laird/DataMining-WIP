So we come in, and look through the menu, ask if they can substitute the meat in a couple of dishes for tofu; they say no, so I order the vegetable fried rice and the egg drop soup and my fiancé orders the lemon chicken, we sit and wait for half an hour while the kid of one of the people who works there, plays loud videos and music that if we were to have dined in, he would have been a heavy nuisance. We finally get our food and leave, when we get home and open up our food platters we see that the chicken breaking is not throughly cooked (so we re cook it) and as I am eating the rice I wish we hadn't decided to try this place. The rice has no flavor whatsoever and you can feel that the rice is not all the way cooked either. I try to add different seasonings to it but it's just unsalvageable. We didn't even touch the soup since it smelled bad, like the eggs were bad. My fiancé eats his chicken and end up throwing up all night.

Most people who are not from the east coast don't get it, I have seen a few reviews about the staff on yelp. I personally like the east coast attitude. The night we dined there one of the lady's was giving me crap (in a fun way) because I didn't eat the mushrooms in the hot-n-sour soup, I picked them out and put them on the side of the plate. Yes, I am a mushroom hater. Anyway I just laughed it off and told her if she didn't put mushrooms in her damn soup, I wouldn't have to do it. It was an oddly comforting exchange.

ATMOSPHERE:  There are tables available but I think this was designed to be a delivery or pick-up kind of location.  The tables and atmosphere are for quick-service.

FOOD:  
Cream Cheese wontons - EXCELLENT.  I couldn't even wait until I got them home.  It helped that I was hungry, but these were delightful and I could have made a meal on just these.
Egg Drop Soup:  Bland, I am sorry to say.  I spiced it up with a little soy and some hot sauce, but it really had no other flavor at all.
Dragon & Phoenix - I was looking forward to this because I love both chicken and shrimp and had not seen combos with both.  I did special order it with carrots and water chestnuts only as I don't like the abundance of onions and green peppers that usually accompany Chinese entrees.  They did an excellent job of making it in accordance with my request.  The portions were more than generous.  I MAYBE ate 1/3 of my entree before I was stuffed  But the flavors, again, were a bit bland.  Perhaps it had to do with the way that I ordered the veggies.  There was no spice either which surprised me because it was supposed to be General Tso's.  

OVERALL:  Not a bad place to eat and I would definitely try it again - this time I'll let them make it the way it's supposed to be made so that I can get the full flavor.",hmhrLfwHkkATV6qonMUjrg,0,0,3,UKVNxRZ_JDp0PVIiqo03KA

We called ahead and asked for the broccoli and beef (large).  

Beef and broccoli was good, nice amount of beef. they didnt skimp. It had a little too much sauce for my liking but everyone else loved it. I'm not a saucy person. 

The lemon chicken had such a light and fresh batter on it. It came on a huge bed of lettuce with fresh lemons. The lemon sauce was on the side and it was a ton! The chicken was very tender, not over cooked at all. I didnt like the lemon sauce, it was very sweet and thick so i skipped it. 

Orange chicken was same as last time. I'm still a sucker for the orange chicken at Panda Express but this is a nice second place. I liked that this time it had pieces of broccoli. Got to get those veggies in! Just shows that they arent consistant though.

OOOH and we also ordered a side of the crab ragoons and they were so crispy and perfect. I was impressed with the amount of crab/creamy cheesy stuff on the inside. 

They told me it would be ready in less than 20 mins and when we went in 15 mins later it was ready to go! (and they were super busy too, so glad i called ahead!) Quick and fresh, cant complain!

It was really cheap, less than 30 bucks for four people and we had left overs for the next day! The entrees were 8 bucks each and all came with steamed rice. Winner!",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,9,7,3,-TadpKofFDNqFZl2FSfxEw

We got the smaller of the family meal and between Steph and I we only ate about half of it. For 26$ delivered (not including tip) it was quite a deal since It felt like it coulda fed three to four depending. We will see if we will be back for more in two hours. :P

We got the egg drop soup with the meal and for entrees I got the Moo Goo Gai Pan and Steph got the Egg Foo Young.
The egg drop soup we both thought was a bit bland. It had a lot of egg but it was all thin wisps and really missed the seriously eggy flavor. The MGGP was good with a few flaws IMO. I am used to fairly authentic MGGP so when the sauce isn't extra thick and it's not made with MSG it's not the same. I've had worse but this is fairly bland to my tastes. Steph was tingly giddy because she said it's the first Egg Foo Young she has had in Vegas that meets up to her strict east coast Egg Foo Young standards (Disclaimer: she is from New York). She said it was all about the sauce, which she could identify by color and smell. The egg rolls and sweet sauce for them was the exact same as from the place I used to eat from in north town that made my baseline for amazing. The pork fried rice was also well done, the peas and carrots didn't seem to be rehydrated or freeze dried but full and juicy and it was all and all great without any soy.

All and all it was a mix, some things where great, some not up to my expectation. I miss my MSG kick but they advertise their lack of MSG, next time I order the MGGP I will ask if they can make it with MSG proper. However for a full review you HAVE to try the pork.. Ok lets be honest, I am going to have to try EVERYTHING, they are walking distance from my apartment, cheap, and are good for the tummy.",AU2aKHGkiVNCi5Io2L_Z2w,1,1,3,VoayeTsidMBRyaKxM58Gvw

I was waiting outside and saw the delivery man wondering around the block, clearly he was lost. So, I walked toward the curb and hailed him over. He said he didn't have a cell phone and he couldn't find my address. Ugh. 

Everyone was starving by the time the food arrived.. We all agreed that we would've been better off eating 25 cent ramen like broke college kids! 

The dumplings were filled with a bland, gummy grayish meat. The hot & sour soup was OK, not great or even good. We also ordered orange chicken, combination lo mein and Mongolian beef. Everything was overcooked, and either overly salty or too bland.

I'd like to preface this part of my review by letting ya'll know how much I hate onions. I can not convey enough how disgusting I find white onions, green onions, red onions, leeks, chives, scallions or anything in the onion family. (It's really hard to order most foods but I digress.) I give the menu a rundown and notice that it's less expensive than most chinese take out places and the cheap ass inside me smiles. I order the lunch special ($5.75!) and a side of lo mein. Then I give the lady my No Onions Please speech. She's like, ""Oh no problem, we don't put onions in our food."" I swear to you, the heavens opened up and and a chorus of angels started singing ""Hallelujah"". You have no idea how rare this is. People put onions in EVERYTHING. But not this place apparently.

So while I'm mentally planning my wedding here, the lady tells me it'll be a five minute wait, which is slightly optimistic, in my opinion. 15 minutes later my food comes out but I'm not even bothered by the amount of time it took since I was still on my onionless high. And the food was delicious. 

So yeah, I'll be back and I recommend, this place to anyone who likes cheap tasty chinese food. I especially invite my fellow Onion Haters to try this place. They get us.",wFL2RrJvTsOVRU6gnRd2WQ,2,0,4,dQaXHK4DRUlQBVuc9ILubQ

Plan ahead, delivery takes at least an hour on a fri night.  Order online & vacuum the house or wash the dog...you'll have time!  I'm not taking off any stars for this since I'm lazy and not driving to get food on a fri night & I had read the other reviews so was prepared to wait.  

I left NY in 1995 and have yet to find any restaurant (fine dining or dive in 6 different states) that makes cold sesame noodles like my favorite hole in the wall in Kew Gardens....until tonight that is!   YUM x10!!  And a big portion (enough for 4).   Tiny little bit of shredded carrots & even tinier bits of shredded cabbage on top which is perfect IMO.   Why muck up the star attraction with veggies?!

The pork fried rice has the perfect amount of peas, pork chunkettes & chinese-y flavor.   No soy sauce necessary and it's not greasy...score!!

We ordered the family dinner with hot/sour soup, egg rolls, sweet/sour chicken (I hate, but it is hubs' favorite) and Mongolian beef (figured it was a safe try-out meal).  

It was still 90 degrees out so we skipped the (steaming hot) soup saving it for later.   The beef was moist, tender-ish and spicy but not tongue on fire hot (I don't like hot so by normal hot & spicy standards it was probably only a 1 out of 5 peppers).  When you order online, there is a place for special instructions so you could get them to make it hotter if you like.  As far as the sweet/sour chicken, the portion is huge and I tasted the chicken (no mystery meat here!) and thought it to have a very good chicken to breading ratio & also NOT greasy.   And I know you thought I forgot to review the egg rolls, but I was saving the best for last.  Get a load of this....we got 2eggrolls, 2 crab Rangoon AND 2 fried shrimp for our appy.....who doesn't love a gift with purchase?!?!  I scarfed both Rangoon & hubs ate the shrimp & 1 eggroll.  It is rare he will agree to eat Chinese food with me and even more rare that he will say anything nice about it, but he says, ""very good, I thought it was all very good/no complaints with anything.   Best we've had (since moving here 2 years ago).  No, really!""

They give you a little packet of 2 mustard, 2 soy sauce & 2 duck sauce and 2 packets of crunchies.  We didn't use any of it...everything had such a good flavor on its own.   There was no plastic ware, but I guess they assumed they were delivering to a house that has silverware.  So if you're picking up or in the middle of moving, ask for plasticware.

4655197,2012-12-07,2,dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw,"New York Chinese Restaurant puts me in a New York State of Mind. It serves New York style Chinese food that is out of this world.

  My past visit to their Lake Mead Boulevard location left me with an exceptional first impression of New York Chinese Restaurant. When I write exceptional first impression, I am saying that it is my contemporary favorite Chinese restaurant in the Vegas valley. With that in mind, when I hiked in Red Rock Canyon this past Saturday, I planned it so that I would try their Fort Apache location on my drive back to Henderson.   

  New York Chinese Restaurant blends into the Fort Apache landscape. Passing the southwest corner of Fort Apache at Spring Mountain, it is easy to pass New York Chinese Restaurant, which sits in a shopping center anchored by a Dollar Tree. Featuring only eight tables and a take-out environment, the restaurant itself is ordinary. Due to the fact that New York Chinese Restaurant appears to have a strong take-out business, I landed a table with ease.

  I ordered Chinese food that delivered me back to my fond memories of eating Chinese food in New York. Their chicken chow mien combination which included won ton soup, crunchy noodles, fried rice, and an egg roll was déjà vu to my taste buds. The fact that New York Chinese Restaurant includes won ton soup instead of the conventional egg drop soup made an impression on me. The New York style chow mien that they feature is a different entrée than the chow Mein served in Las Vegas Chinese restaurants.  This chow mien is vegetable instead of noodle based. Because I dislike celery, I specifically directed them to eliminate the celery. They listened and the chow mien was first-rate. 

   
  Their cold beverages are Coke beverages. It works like this. If you order a cold beverage, they give you a disposable cup. Near the counter is the Coke machine. You serve yourself as often as you want.

  When you dine in, they will deliver your food to the table and clean up after you. I feel that this service deserves a dollar tip. Most of all I feel that Yelpers deserve a bigger tip: As of the time I write this review, New York Chinese Restaurant is a first-rate restaurant specializing in New York style Chinese food that will put you in a New York State of Mind.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,6,2,4,gAfOT-DWrl6_ienKZHZLBA

It's not the best Chinese I've had, but it satisfied the craving I had for chicken and broccoli and meant we didn't have to cook. For 2 people it was less than $20 and we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, so that's super cheap in my opinion.

I was visiting some friends in Vegas and wanted Chinese food realllly bad.  We decided to order from New York Chinese Restaurant Inc and got:

Chicken Fried Rice
Chicken and Broccoli
Chicken and Mushroom
Shrimp Wonton Soup

I didn't realize all the dishes had chicken.  Anywho, I was super excited because I love Chinese food.  At the same time, I'm also really picky as I've grown up eating amazing food cooked by my madre and was surrounded by what I call Little Taipei (Rowland Heights).

The soup was pretty tasty and had many wontons in it.  My friend commented that it tasted like carrots however there were no carrots in the soup.  Either way, I think that was probably the best dish of the bunch.

The chicken fried rice was a little bland and didn't have any egg even though we requested specifically to have egg in it.  Chicken and mushroom had a great sauce to it, I have to say it was tasty.  As for the chicken and broccoli, I was a little less impressed with that.

All in all, New York Chinese Restaurant Inc. can be a quick fix when you're short on time and money in the city of sin.",osSzFkfeMP417i9Qb4rmEw,0,0,3,5pdBkRZEkiSOvAw91pnTfA
5568075,2014-06-26,1,dblGQtHAzNy1ACis1m2shw,"This place claims ""no msg,"" which is great. However, they most likely use a lot of soy sauce to compensate, which must be why many of their dishes have a browner sauce or tint. Fried rice is super brown! I'm used to a reddish Szechwan, theirs was brown. Moo shi chicken; way too brown, lacked fried egg, skimpy itsy bitsy chicken pieces, & too many mushrooms. BUT, hot n sour soup & egg drop are good for a hole in the wall take out joint. Shrimp dishes aren't skimpy, big shrimp! Nothing was too salty. I stopped in 5 min before closing just for an egg drop soup & had to wait 10 min; NOT complaining, I watched him make it FRESH! Good to know they're not reusing old soup! On another visit, they gave me a free 2 liter for my order over $30 (I think.) That's a helluva perk! If u live close, go for it. Rice n Noodle on Rainbow was my fav but I moved so this will have to do & I'm ok with that.",6fh175INr4nvJrfsuGiiuA,1,1,4,dr4zzvYf6ut51GB9ayqXtw

So that means in the 40 minutes after the EDT the driver still hadn't left the restaurant until I called and asked that first time. And the restaurant isn't even 15 minutes from my house, so who knows how old my food was.

The food is always fresh.
We really love the Crab Ragoon so far it as never been burnt. Just lightly cooked and very appetizing. Fried Shrimp is big not on a stick.
We always get delivery from

But #New York Style Chinese Restaurant is way better.
I usually get the Shrimp & Lobster Sauce their Shrinp &Lobster Sauce has crab meat in it.  # Little Dumpling does not.
My husband will try anything and it is always good.
We tried the Shrimp and Cashew big shrimps and a lot of different kind of vegetables in a brown sauce.
My husband tried their version of sesame chicken and it was very good and it was not dried out.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there was no menu on the wall. You walk up to the front counter and take one of their menus that are printed on nice paper. Just thought that was weird, I mean the least they could do was laminate a few of the menus so it would be easier for customers to look at.

I decided to order the Sweet Sour Chicken Lunch Special, which came with

-Egg Drop Soup: thick and pretty bland. I have definitely tasted better. Next time I will try the Wonton or Hot and Sour soup.
-Crab Rangoon: it tasted like 98% cream cheese. It was like eating a big spoonful of it with no crab whatsoever.
-Sweet and Sour Chicken: pretty good because it was lightly battered, which was nice, and the sauce was tasty.

They did not charge extra for brown rice, portions were big and the price was very reasonable for all that food. I took my order to go and did not have to wait very long. The cashier who took my order wasn't very nice. He kind of just stared at me, not saying anything and waiting for me to give him my order. However, the employee who brought me my order when it was ready was friendly. He actually thanked me and said ""have a good day.""

I would definitely like to come back and try other items on their menu. Hopefully it will be better the next time around.
