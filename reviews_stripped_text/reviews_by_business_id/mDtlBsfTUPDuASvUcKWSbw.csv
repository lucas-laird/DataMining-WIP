I called and spoke to the female cashier who took my order and she immediately knew why I was calling. She stated  to come by and pick up my Masubi. When I arrived, I apologized for not noticing it was in the bag and she stated they were going to make me a new one as the one I originally ordered had been sitting out. I waited less than 3 minutes and when she handed me the container I was surprised to see that they had given me 2 Masubi's when I had only ordered one. The cashier stated it was a courtesy, smiled, and wished me a good day! I thanked her and stated that she will definitely be seeing me again. I am firm believer that restaurants including quick service restaurants should not only produce good products but they should also provide even better customer service as customer satisfaction is one of the key differentiators between you and your competitors.

This is just down the street from my apartment so having them around is just so convenient! But convenience is not the reason why I keep coming here. I love their food!

Usually, I call them to do my order because I'm not really a fan of sitting in the restaurant after I order. So having the take-out option is fantastic from this place! Usually I get the combo which is great because you get to try everything out! Each of the meals comes with a deliciously made macaroni salad which always gets devoured first! 

Again, I always get the combination which is actually the BBQ mix. It's a combination of chicken, beef, and bbq. Fantastic combination of hearty meal with deliciously made sticky rice along with it. I'm a fan of this meal since it's very filling. It's deliciously seasoned so you're not just getting bland meat upon order. I think that they're all beautifully executed. 

Another thing that I get there is the loco moco. I don't know who orinally came up with this combination, but I just want to say-- AMAZING! I love the meat along with the gravy incorporated along with it. This is all over a bed of rice. This is just Asian comfort at it's best. 

The location isn't really at the best place as it's not as busy, but I don't think people really care about that since you'll see people coming in and out on their busy hours. I think this shows that regardless of location, if you have good food, people will go out of their way to visit you.

Food came quickly and she brought it to my table with a smile. Despite lack of flavor in the saimin, I still got full. She asked if I wanted shoyu and hot sauce beforehand and I had said no. Less sodium for me. I hate musubis that have mushy rice and a small size of spam inside but the musubi here was pretty decent.

3963010,2014-06-23,0,mDtlBsfTUPDuASvUcKWSbw,"Ordered take out yesterday, was ready in 10mins. The chicken katsu plate was good as expected but the Hawaiian Plate (laulau & kalua pig) wasn't as good as other L&L locations. Usually when I get their laulau it's wrapped in the Ti leaf still but this one was already opened for me (which could cause one to think if they really used Ti leaf to steam it or foil?) and it ended up a little I. The dry side. Also the kalua pig with cabbage was dry as well. It was more like roast pork shredded (think carnita) versus the moist shredded pork that is usually kalua pig to where there is still some liquid in it. But the flavors were on point, no shoyu needed on anything and portions were more then fair. So if u got the Hawaiian food craving this place works!",RdTdVgd9u58BA52d0eHqcQ,0,1,4,UGQRYhhw0_tGU-R2Kc4T_Q

She took my order and brought me my food. I ordered the mini short rib with a side of fried sunny side up egg. It was delicious and they gave me plenty of delicious meat and wasn't cheap about it. They have so many options for ordering here. I wanted to try the garlic shrimp but they only had regular size instead of mini so I will be back to try their garlic shrimp and other items. This location was great and it's right by my place. Price was affordable too. Definitely recommend.,lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,2,2,5,l1-zJaOw8uxB56-4LvcRaA

Boy was I disappointed in the katsu meat. Not as white and lean as I like, but I can look past that. What I can't forgive is chewing on ""mystery"" hard parts inside the chicken - unforgivable! 

My girlfriend's BBQ chicken was not too bad, but salty. At least it was edible.
 
L&L stores that I used to frequent on the east side (one by The Galleria and the other on Nellis) used fantastic meat in their katsu. This L&L on Jones needs to follow their lead and stop passing off cheap meat...",XbrgwqwKyCUAVeQMSE7Lvg,1,0,1,Ty23cZfhpxcpiaby2Bv-Hg

All on a bed of rice.  Mahi was moist with a nice crust, beef had great flavor and char as did the chicken.  Spam was spam and also crisped on exterior.

Seafood Mix - fried shrimp, mahi mahi and chicken katsu with double rice instead of macaroni salad. Shrimp and katsu were delicous... haven't made it to mahi mahi yet as the freaking plate was enough to feed 3 people.

Cream cheese wraps - otherwise known as crab rangoon --- this location was giving out free ones for their soft opening and they were amazing... I could eat 6 or 12 of these :)

On my way home from work so this may be a regular stop... if you are not a big eater you could easily make 2-3 meals out of the combination plates. We plan to split one from now on. This location is so new it's not even on their website yet.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,1,5,DnILD4n2QBNnZFbG5MaeqA

5340750,2018-01-04,0,mDtlBsfTUPDuASvUcKWSbw,"For some reason we wanted to eat Hawaiian food and we heard about this chain. It's more of a fast food joint than a restaurant so no need to dress up other than super casual.

Each meal comes with two scoops of white rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. Nothing extraordinarily amazing about either but still good pairing. We got the garlic shrimp and it's deep fried and then added with tons of garlic. If you are not a garlic fan DO NOT ORDER this!!!

Get the spam musabi! It has some cool sweet sauce which was a good pairing with the saltiness of the spam. 

Overall, cool meal to try but not something I want to eat a lot... maybe once every 6 months? Haha plus I think I can make most of these meals at home too but I'm just to lazy to make them. That's exactly what this is... lazy comfort food!",0aGMVKiNqmY1kCc5983UkQ,0,0,4,K_x9dkfOleeLmFye2i29ng

The only difference that I noticed was that some locations put way to much rice in the Spam Musubis. Although it's not the best Hawaiian food in the city, they have many locations and the food is good enough. 

Things I like about this location:
-Quick and convenient: I usually call in my to go order and my food is already ready when promised.
-Friendly staff: The two employees that I have seen working in the front have always been very nice and don't mind giving you extra sauce when requested. They also promote their stamp card: buy 9 regular plate lunches and get the 10th plate free! I know that other locations have this as well, but they don't care to tell you about it. 
-The restaurant is very clean.

What I hate about this location:
- The area is kind of ghetto. I have seen homeless and some weird people hanging out at this plaza so be careful!
-The parking: the parking stalls right in front of the restaurant are tiny. If someone else parks next to you, good luck trying to get in and out of your car!
