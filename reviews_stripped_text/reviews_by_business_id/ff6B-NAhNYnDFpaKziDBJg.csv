433083,2011-02-20,2,ff6B-NAhNYnDFpaKziDBJg,"Lol, I know nobody will care for this review cuz it's Jack in the Box & all, but who cares...I do, that's who ;)

Every now & again I like to slum & get JITB, I mean who doesn't?! Especially those of us from the West Coast. Such a deal! 

The food is decent, depending on the location of course. But, overall you get a good bang for your buck. I mean c'mon, 2 tacos for .99 cents!! These tacos are better than some I have had from some Mexican places :P

Anyways, I give them 4 stars cuz I like them & it's definitely a West Coast & nostalgia thing for me, from going there as a kid after school, back in the day when they has Pizza Pockets & Frings! Lol, that's right, Frings. A combo of fries & onion rings. Awww...I really miss those days.",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,1,2,4,5D7ArHrJbHILdylifM839g

First I just want to say the order menu that verifies accuracy was not working or perhaps not in use, with that said it was almost impossible to communicate my order. I'm craving a Southwest Grilled chicken salad so of course they don't have any available that's ok because I always plan ahead and order the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl instead, but why for the life of me are there never any salads at a certain hour? I proceed with my order, and order 2 Jumbo Jacks the guy ask me if I want those in a combo, NO buddy, if I wanted the combo I would have gave you the combo number to begin with. I then order my last item which is just a plain kids hamburger for my dog, again he wants to make it a combo grrr! Then it's time to verify my order and he blurs through my entire order in one syllable. I ask him to repeat my order, and of course he sighs then reads it back with an attitude. What confuses me even more is why would you read back my order by saying 2 Jumbo Jacks with NO CHEESE. News flash dude, 2 Jumbo Quacks with no cheese are still just 2 Jumbo Quacks LOL.",KXcRKSjoJpESpvozLXH42w,0,0,1,QYU36SL2i5HDeWOj3EbkUA

I'm not sure why it's so hard but every time I say extra lettuce tomato and pickles it just never happens. I don't mean that for this particular drive-through I mean that anywhere I go.  But this time when I got to work and started eating my breakfast Jack it was amazing it actually had extra lettuce tomato and pickles THANK YOU so much for whoever did it right today February 10, 2016 at 5:39:47 AM through the drive-through store #159.",tV-q3aoHwTt6UgqKwDArjQ,0,0,5,dxLdW2yzv8FDzbbNP6_xHQ

I repeatedly ordered a regular Oreo shake, and small curly fries. I was charged for a large fry(which I didn't debate because I was hungry) and as soon as he handed me my shake, it hand a weird dent in the lid. I didn't think I had to check my food because I only had ordered fries. I looked down in the bag at regular straight fries, as I was pulling out. I immediately backed up and let him know about the error, and he acted like I was wrong. . After my 30 second drive home, I dig into a bag of cold fries.

2016919,2014-08-27,5,ff6B-NAhNYnDFpaKziDBJg,"I rarely eat fast food but hey, some times  a girl craves curly fries.
This location has the absolute worst service: completely unable to get an order correct.  You would think they'd be able to find competent staff, being located across the street from a community college but apparently not.

1. Ordered a munchie meal to split with my guy. Order placed fine, payment matched the order, got home to a chicken patty on a bun and curly fries all over the bag. No tacos to be found, not the sandwich we ordered, no container for the fries.

2. Tried multiple times to order a smoothie. It's on their menu but they apparently just don't make them, or are unable to stock the correct materials. It's fast food, the ingredients are frozen, this shouldn't be that difficult.

3. Drove by on my way to dinner plans, cars in drive-thru. Dining partner called to cancel, turned around to go in the drive-thru myself. Menu board on, no service. Dining room lights off. Closed early? Weird.
Drove around the block and grabbed something else. Came back by, and what do you know? They're serving out the drive thru window again.

I guess if you're only planning to really get the business of the community college, you can set your hours for whatever you like. But if you can't get an order right, you won't get repeat business. And if you can't adhere to your own hours, you won't get any additional business from the tons of residents in the area.

Please put someone on drive thru duty who has active working brain cells.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,6,1,05rVLz-3rXabPskGje2xHA

I see the exact same reviews on here for years now At this same location! Ignorant rude people and they are demanding $15 an hour? What a joke! Get a damned education and then go ask for $15 an hour lazy idiot! And that's exactly what it is! LAZY! 

Literally sat at the order board for 5 mins and 40 seconds before she even took my order. 1 car in front of me at the window... So of course the shake machine is not working. It has not worked here for 3 months now and no I'm not exaggerating. So I order a chicken sandwich with no lettuce and 2 tacos. Tacos were stale. I could hardly bite into them and I had to yank the taco back and forth like a rabid dog to tear the piece off. I spit it out! Chicken sandwich was all white like it was freezer burnt before they through it in the week old greasy fryer! I also got a Sprite. There was maybe 2-3 mouthfuls of Sprite in the cup. They fill the medium cup all the way to the top with ice so they dnt have to give u much soda or whatever u order to drink. The girl was overall just pissy and didn't want to be at work. I don't eat fast food very much but I will never go to this location again. Bunch of lazy morons! And maybe someone can get the stupid shake machine to work for them cause no one there can seem to figure out how to turn the damned thing on and put a cup under the spout!",RQTtZ4BLYCHGUISOZrFrIg,0,0,1,jud4KqoKZ3IVnNjnxyaDlA
