My family and I ate here for lunch today, 5/25/2012.  Our server was Karen.

We were interested in trying this place because of the promotion, ""Kids Eat Free M-F until 2pm with dining adult.""  That is all it says, with ""dining adult.""  We each had a pizza and when we got our bill we were charged $6 for our son's meal.  When I asked why, Karen told me that pizza didn't count as an entree.  I told her that her signs all say ""dining adult"" with no stipulations.  She refused to budge.  She also refused to give me a receipt.

After leaving I called to speak with a manager since I was still upset.  The manager, Kristina (Christina?), kept repeating that it was ""with an adult entree.""  I kept telling her that all her signs said ""With a dining adult"" which would be myself and my husband and why would pizza not be an entree?  She started to tell me that no other discounts can be used.  We had no other discounts.  It was only when I mentioned that Bait & Switch is a completely illegal practice did she begin to backtrack, say she would speak to Karen, and that she would refund us if we came back.

The food was ok, nothing spectacular, and the service was very slow.  Karen took my drink order and then left to get it without asking my husband or son what they would like.

Also, the table next to us (a blond family with French accents) also had issues with the ""kids eat free"" promotion, so I know it was not just us.

I told the manager she may want to read these Yelp reviews rather than keep arguing with me about something I know to be completely illegal.",11BhFimEFbG4WX9BCnxJhg,2,0,1,wMMhDZvg3j-_QhNCcct06g

We went after work, had a few drinks, an appetizer, and some entrees.  The food was good, the bartender attractive and friendly, and the drinks lower priced than yardhouse downstairs.    They also have tater tots, which I'm always a fan of. ;)

We're picky eaters and so are used to getting our orders made incorrectly.  Sure enough, my wife's sandwich came out with cheese after being requested no cheese, this isn't really a problem, as long as the staff acknowledges the mistake and corrects it quickly, they did, which is really all I can ask for.

Additionally, we're cutting out a lot of fried foods out of our diet, so of course was a bit worried when we got there, but actually the menu was great, plenty of options for those who don't want to for the delicious but heavier fried foods.",02sxoqCJ_1lbk_t2GCLxQQ,1,0,4,D2ScWkpLi9jMKkM6COT-5w

I ask for a different drink. It takes another 15 minutes to get my second choice. Our food took another 15-20 minutes. Then I find out there are other happy hour specials that we were never told about. We paid $10 per drink instead of $3 per drink. And just as I was trying to get someone's attention to bring me a REAL $3 happy hour drink, our server comes over with the check and tells us ""no rush"" Really?! No rush?!

We did end up going during a football game (we don't watch) and we had a 20% off coupon from valet we wanted to use, but we ended up getting some football deals instead. At first I didn't really know what to order, I don't eat pork and the main things were pulled pork, pork ribs, etc. But I wanted to try their style food which was southern. We ended up ordering potato skins with chicken as our appetizer which was absolutely amazing. They were delicious and I almost wish we had only ordered appetizers and sides.

We got the brisket, which wasn't that good. There was a lot of fat on it and we particularly didn't like the sauce, but ate it anyways. We also got the fries and corn which were great. The buffalo chicken pizza we ordered wasn't that good either. The sauce was pretty hot, but the chicken didn't taste good. 

Besides the food, since everyone has different tastes, I would say it was pretty great. The service wold have gotten a 4 out of 5. Our waitress was great, she continually refilled our drinks and helped us out when we were trying to figure out what to order. I believe a manager brought out our food, which was nice, she was very kind and helpful, but she wasn't wearing anything to identify herself as staff. Also, a man came up and took our plate when we were finished, but it was awkward because he just grabbed it off the side of our table and was in plain clothes, we didn't even know if he worked there. 

The place is nice. It has a theme to it. There're guitars all over one wall, a bull, and it was nice. We didn't like all the loud football fans, but we also didn't go there realizing there was a game on. So 3/5",yQuEw5dp9G3Uac5XaSogQg,1,0,3,eFvbumUNfWtdfzKxqQJLzg

All of the interior is the same. I was excited to try a new restaurant at town square, I got there and met my friends and waited for about 10 minutes until a waitress finally came by. We ordered drinks, and ordered our food. The appetizer came out, and it was bbq nachos, something different but not great at all. It seemed as if they popped it in the microwave, and put cubes of cheddar/nacho cheese on the chips because there was UNMELTED cubes of cheese throughout the dish. Our food came, and one of my friends had to send her plate back as the mahi mahi was completely overcooked and dry, embarrassed because she had never in her life sent back a plate. I ordered a chili cheese burger, Hmmm, seems as if my chili was missing?  The girl had all of our bills split separately BEFORE we gave her our credit cards. She came back with a long bill that was split 4 times, 4 different totals. We double checked everything, and wrote our names that were on our credit cards next to the totals. She came back with receipts to sign and we left. A few days later I check my online account and noticed a $107 charge on my card from ranch house. I immediately called them, notified them of it, and was told that they would contact accounting and someone will call or email to let me know what happened. I got a hold of a friend who was there, and she checked her account and there were NO charges from ranch house. I called them back, told them that my card was charged for the ENTIRE bill. 

I was called back at the end of the day, told that it was an error made by our server, and that I'll be credited/charged the correct amount. And that I could come in for another meal.

I appreciated the follow up and quick response, I am happy that the problem will be solved. For an error like this, it seems as if the restaurant should have credited the entire amount from my account. Needless to say, I will not return here. The food was horrible, service was bad (the place had about 6-8 tables filled during lunch time). If the food was good I would return even with bad service, but the prices are very high as well for a lunch meal at town square.

We were just going to stop in for a drink as we were intending to go to the new Coconut's Mexican restaurant across the way but they did not open until noon.  Well since we all had to be back for meetings at 1pm we decided to stay.  We were told by the bartender that the food was very good and she is sadly mistaken.  I had the 1lb pulled pork with root beer BBQ sauce and it arrived lukewarm to cold and it was nearly tasteless. I ate a few bites and my stomach is in knots right now as well as two others that also had the pork.  Another coworker had the beef brisket and he said it was very greasy and his stomach is in knots as well. 

It's kind of sad that a place that is just opening isn't paying more attention.  To ruin the reputation of a very nice looking restaurant the first week or so out is horrible. They had a lot of staff on hand but it seemed like people were just walking around doing nothing. In all fairness they did try to make things right by removing my order from the bill and providing free drink cards (we left them on the table as I doubt we will be back).

1402848,2012-05-06,0,SGPjYRy6x7R5ZlGa_nrskg,"My family and I came here after watching a movie during their Happy Hour. First off the server (Chelsea) was pleasant, but seemed to get annoyed that we hadn't made up our minds after visiting out table 3 times within a 10 minute span. She also didn't help with suggestions. If they had any specials, we were not made aware of any.

Their Happy Hour selections were a handful of $6 appetizers which consisted mostly of sliders. Not very suitable I guess who is someone that has cut meat from their diet, so I ventured to their dinner menu. I was actually in the mood for an appetizer but was disappointed that it was nothing more than a bunch of fried items. I had been to Yardhouse earier in the week so my appetizer expectations were set pretty high.

The only thing that caught my eye was the grilled ahi tuna because the description said it was served on a bed of fried green tomatoes and kale. When she brought it, it was missing the green tomatoes. I brought this to her attention and she repled, ""oh those have been 86'd and we won't be getting those in until our grand opening."" Really? That, my dear, should have been brought to my attention when I ordered it because that would have been a deal-breaker and I would have ordered something else. The tuna was bland and so was the kale. It was served with a side of this creamed corn mush which I thought was kind of a strange and off pairing for ahi tuna. Thank goodness I had the extra lemon on hand which I had to request because it did not come with my iced tea.

My husband had the wings off the Happy Hour menu which he thought were decent size and just ok. My older son ordered the same thing I did and shared the same opinion. My younger son had the ribs from the kids menu which were decent and a generous side of green beans which looked pretty good. We were charged $2 for the side of green beans when the kids menu clearly stated ""served with a side."" My husband brought this to the server's attention and explained how this can be misleading that we were charged for a side that says it comes with the kids' entree. She understood and took it off the bill without any problem.

Needless to say, it just made me ill to pay $60 of our money and time when there are so many other better places in Town Square. Pretty disappointing. I thought that it's predecessor, Cadillac Ranch, was decent and had a great menu selection and was hoping that  it's replacement would be at the very least equal or better.

They have $10 bottomless beer from 10pm to close every night. Well at least that's what I was told, then went to the bar to buy my bottomless beer and was told it was only from 10pm to midnight. Then took my bottomless 2 hour beer to my table and was informed by the server that it was indeed 10pm to close (about 2am). Unfortunately I didn't find out until 11:15pm that it was until close and by that point I had drank 4 beers to ""get my fill."" They also offer $3 well drinks in conjunction with their beer offerings.

So it was a Saturday night, they had a great live band, but not very many people. Strange since Town Square is so popular. Regarding the food & drink, I've had better. To quote the comedian Jim Jeffries, ""we don't drink because we want to, we drink because we have to."" $10 bottomless beer is limited to Budweiser, Bud Light, MichUltra, or PBR. The food would have been rated 2 stars, possibly 1. They have a list of $6 ""Happy Hour"" appetizers that are pretty unappetizing. Sliders were dry. Queso meat dip was just weird.

It seems like Ranch House Kitchen has been attracting a lot of bad rap, but I think the place deserves a second chance. For a bar-food restaurant it wasn't bad at all. In fact, I quite enjoyed it. Being located at Town Square I think some people might walk in with high expectations.

We chose to sit on the patio because there's four big screen TVs playing each of the college football games. I love it how there's misters everywhere, it never got too hot in the +100 degree weather that day. The overall decor is nice, themed like an average BBQ venue - sports memorabilia, wooden walls and furniture, and lots of TVs. The service is some of the friendliest I have had! It was pretty busy but the staff took care of our water and orders constantly. My order came in about 20 minutes, even though the place was pretty busy.

We ordered the chicken fingers, potato skins and taco pizza, which are all under the Happy Hour menu at 50% off. The potato skins are my favorite, served with melted cheese, chives, and a touch of sour cream. None of the dishes were THAT oily. Try having real bar food from a small local casino near Boulder Highway and you'll know what I mean. The food is nothing to rave about, but for what it was, I liked it. Chicken fingers were served hot and the taco pizza was pretty unique, although I'll probably have regular pepperoni next time.

The biggest takeaways for me was their lack of a standard nacho dish. They have a nacho dish but it only comes in BBQ flavor. Why? I personally don't like BBQ seasoning except when it's used for meat. Also, their pizza menu is pretty small. They don't have a supreme topping, something that has everything on it. They just have a few regular ones. In the end, we were happy replacing the two with the potato skins and the taco pizza, but I can understand how this can upset some eaters.

Seeing that places like TGIF and Applebee's have four stars or close to it, I think Ranch House Kitchen deserves better. There was nothing in my visit that warranted a two star rating. If they work on their selections and menu better, I'd be glad to give them a higher rating on my next visit.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,2,3,QLbbIvf6UOb6SR8SOp_tAw
3006383,2012-06-10,1,SGPjYRy6x7R5ZlGa_nrskg,"My boyfriend, our friend, and I went on a Saturday night. I had read about the change from Cadillac Ranch and thought it was worth a shot. I felt pretty meh about Cadillac Ranch and I like to try new places. Another friend of mine referred to this place as ""the place where they stand outside and beg you to come in."" There's a reason they have to beg people to come in we would soon find out. We did get the option of outside or inside seating; we chose inside, booth. 

It was 10ish minutes before someone came to ask if we wanted drinks. She said they were switching sections so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but seeing staff socializing and drinking while you wait, even if it's due to a section switch, just makes you more annoyed and frustrated. The server was actually quite friendly and attentive. She tried to tell us about happy hour, but she wasn't sure when it began or ended. The whole conversation gave me the impression there's a lack of continuity in training the staff. We needed a minute to decide, she brought our drinks in a reasonable time. I ordered the cucumber mojito which was delicious. That was pretty much the highlight of my meal though.

Our food seemed to take a long time, although I'm not sure exactly what the time frame was. It could have been that I was frustrated with the experience already at this point. When it finally arrived it was meh. My boyfriend ordered the firecracker coleslaw which at first he thought had Rice Krispies in it on account of the crackling sound. He soon deduced it was actually pop rocks. There was no description of the coleslaw so he assumed ""firecracker"" referred to a spicy flavor rather that the sound it makes. While I get what they're trying to do, it really seemed like a crappy dish made from ingredients on the Food Network show Chopped. He said his burger tasted like a Burger King burger with Ranch House's crappy chili on it. I had the sliders with roasted jalepeños and ""garlic salsa."" By garlic salsa they mean marinara sauce. I had green beans with mine which tasted like they were waived over hot water. They were crunchier than they should have been, practically raw. Our friend's meal was meh. Underwhelming to say the least. In an attempt to redeem the meal, I wanted to order the sweet potato melt only to be informed they were out of sweet potatoes. At that point I threw my hands up and decided it was a place I'd rather not return to. I suspect it won't be around long.

I thought that was the end of it, until I woke up sick this morning. I didn't have anything else after that meal and I'll be spending my day nursing my digestive system. I would advise against this place whole-heartedly which is unusual for me. I generally give places at least 2 visits before I review.

Menu is pretty wide from breakfast thru dinner and most everything has a western type twist on normal American foods. Alot  of sandwiches, pizzas, salads all with a twist. 
Full bar service at tables and a stand alone bar. Plus the bigtime mechanical bull when you think you wanna show what you got. Not recommended after eating :)

There are three things that I will say were good about this place: my watermelon jar cocktail, the sauteed kale, and the service. Our waitress was super nice, the hostess/bartender, too, and both were willing to be friendly and chatty without getting up in our space. The cocktail was fruity and delicious, refreshing and at once dangerous. More than one, and it could have meant an afternoon bent over the toilet, especially considering the proceeding meal. But I digress--the service, the kale, and the cocktail: that's where the good parts end.

Chips and queso con carne--this was straight up chemicals with cold ground beef on top with fry bread chips. I ate it because it was there, and also because somehow I have an affinity for Taco Bell-calibre food, especially in a place with liquor.  We ate some and moved on.

I ordered a Caesar Salad with Mahi Mahi on top. The fish was cold and slimy, and the dressing tasted disgusting, and had zero Caesar flavor to it. Applebee's has a better Caesar than this--it was a pretty confusing excuse for Caesar. My boyfriend had a sandwich with a hamburger (overcooked), BBQ pork, and bacon and a side salad. His salad was also particularly weird, though we both agreed that his sandwich was the entree winner.

As for sides: we ordered the Dorito mac and cheese, and let me tell you. Whatever kind of cinnamon-sugar they are using in the cheese sauce portion of that dish made my taste bugs scream in pain. I'm extremely judicious in using profanity to describe foods, good and bad, but I can safely say that I truly thought, WTF is this mac and cheese debacle? The sauteed kale was good--I just wanted to have a nice vegetable-laden lunch--but it wasn't enough to rectify the meal.

I'm so very sad to say that I will not be back. It has a cool decor and a very cool set of ideas behind it, but it was not worth even the $11 I ended up spending on top of the gift certificate.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,5,0,2,rzlcoxP9-_wWxhzLNGx7JA

I had never eaten here before, and I did indeed check the reviews before entering this place, but I threw caution to the wind because they had less of a wait time than Yard House. Oh boy, that's where I went wrong.

The hostesses were pleasant, and the wait really was not that bad. But then we were sat in this strange booth that was completely separate from the dining room and it was on the side of the bar, but not a part of the bar either because there was a railing between us and the bar. 

I'm not going to completely document our experience, but I am going to highlight a few of the more deplorable offenses. The waiter sniffed my drink to make sure it was Dr. Pepper. WTF moment number 1. We ordered pretty simple dishes because we were indeed going to see a movie. My niece ordered a BLT with the Doritos Mac & Cheese side dish. I ordered half a house salad and the Loaded Baked Potatoes with the Pulled Pork. We then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes before our waiter arrived at our table to tell us there was a big party taking up the kitchen and our meals would be out ""very soon"". So, we missed our movie. Luckily there was another showing an hour later.

Next, we waited again for our food. During this time the manager came up to us and apologized, comped our meal, and gave us a free dessert.

The meal finally arrived. They brought the incorrect sandwich to my niece. She ordered a BLT and it was a turkey club. She had to wipe all the turkey off of it. The salad was a poor excuse for a salad with tiny witherlings of shaved carrots. The loaded baked potatoes were okay, but the drizzling sauces they put all over it were not my thing. The Doritos Mac & Cheese was seriously one of the worst things I've eaten in my entire life. My niece and I both agreed would wretch right there at the table if we had another bite.

We then awaited our cookie (minus the ice cream) so we could take it to go. We waited, and waited, and waited. Our server arrived to inform us it was still being cooked (we already about to be late to the SECOND MOVIE SHOWING). I decided to leave, so we walked out the door. Our waiter (running) met us at the door of the movie theater to give us our absolutely cold and disgusting cookie.

I know that this place was formerly Cadillac Ranch, and I was never there under the previous management. I am not sure if this means I am at a disadvantage with nothing for comparison, or that I have the benefit of being unbiased.

We went to Ranch House Kitchen on Monday night after seeing a movie at the Rave Theaters.  We had been at the Yardhouse for dinner, so we wanted to check out something different for post-movie drinks.  As we were walking up we were somewhat awkwardly greeted by a Ranch House hostess, about 10 feet outside of the restaurant.  She was VERY nice, but it was a weird spot to be greeted.

Going into the restaurant, it looked like a great place. HUGE (probably too big) but it looked like it should have been a place that was successful - clearly they had put a lot of money into it.  Sadly.... we were just about the only customers in the joint.  As we walked past the mechanical bull I was a bit surprised to see a girl of no more than 8 sitting on it.  It was strange to say the least.

We finally got to our table and we quickly noticed that the employees outnumbered the guests by at least 4:1.  Our first round of drinks came out pretty slowly, and my friend said the margarita was awful. We ordered wings with our next beers and they were standard bar wings -- not bad, but certainly nothing that would bring me back.

We had two waitresses, one who was evidently in training.  It was clear that the girl who had been there awhile was not very interested in us.  The girl who was training was much more attentive and spent some time talking to us at the table, which I suppose we expected from them since the place was basically empty.

Overall it was sort of a strange experience.  The beer was cold and the wings were hot, but there was nothing that would make me want to go back to Ranch House Kitchen.  REPORTEDLY they do draw customers most nights, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Just not sure why anyone would go to Ranch House when they can pop down to Yardhouse where there is a MUCH bigger beer selection.",ZaXJ9AaYOqFUMkJ1ddpciQ,0,0,2,Sh2QMmMKDYBIRUL7lBinrQ

On the Saturday before Halloween, I discovered that it changed to the Ranch House Kitchen.  A couple of friends and I, attended a Cross fit party and wanted to try a few appetizers during our visit.

For the appetizers, we got the 8 piece buffalo fingers (medium) for $11.95 and the Ultimate Quesadilla for $7.95.  The chicken fingers were nothing special.  Just your typical fingers, didn't really stand out for me.  I didn't like the buffalo sauce.  I thought it was too tangy and borderline sour.  For the quesadilla, we got the pulled chicken.  The quesadilla is filled with shredded cheddar, jalapenos (charred), caramelized onions and pico de gallo.  My thoughts?  Super inauthentic.  Very generic and not impressed at all.  

When I started Yelping, I knew that I would have to be comfortable with giving not-so-stellar reviews.  I didn't give a lower rating because I appreciate the country theme.  I'm a big fan of country restaurants and bars because of the wooden accents and the character and vibe it offers.  You should definitely check it out for yourself.

5083708,2012-05-09,0,SGPjYRy6x7R5ZlGa_nrskg,So me and my girlfriend watched avengers and we walked by the ranch house and asked the hostess to see the menu and what kind of specials they have. They had 8.95 lunch specials I thought it was gonna be great..... The service sucked waited for 10 min for our waiter to take our order...well we ordered the honey glazed chicken and the ribs......once we got our food we splitted our food......the ribs were only 4 pieces and the chicken was pretty small....we tried the chicken first and it was pretty simple white rice with grilled chicken and just salsa on top wasn't really what I was expecting.... the dish was pretty mediocre and the ribs came with a choice of a side so we had the corn bread......the ribs were pretty dry and it tasted like it was smoked and it wasnt tender at all but there was good thing about the dish was the cornbread it seemed like it was homemade and it was sweet and tasty and not tasting like it was store bought or premade. The server was giving us pretty bad service he asked us about 4 times if our food is alright within the 5 min we had our food and the 5th time he asked me if I was done with my food which I wasnt ... I felt like I was getting bugged and rushed to eat my food.... I hope this place steps up I know they're new but the service and food needs to step up a little.. ill give it 5 stars the next time I visit if they step it up a notch and listen to the customers on yelp that love real food...,aR9HHc3LEicAOXt2jaITKg,2,0,1,LMU3ERRhywUjg_9Y506bNg

I had never heard of this restaurant ever until I visited Vegas for a few days and visited the Town Square Las Vegas shopping mall, where this restaurant is located.  I was there at 10am one weekday during the last week of Dec.  This place actually serves breakfast all day.  It wasn't crowded at all since the place just opened that day, but the menu looked pretty good.  My boyfriend who's a big breakfast person, ordered the stack of whole grain pancakes with blueberries, which he really liked and I tried their turkey burger.  The turkey patty itself was nothing special, but when added with the grilled onions, melted cheese, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, and even raw red onions, it didn't taste too bad.  Their french fries are REALLY good, better than many restaurants!  They have a surprisingly good-tasting flavor!

The decor is like it's name, like you're in a ranch house, so there's cowboy-type decor and the whole ceiling is covered with old license plates.  There's even a mechanical bull to ride.  The restroom is different...dim with black toilets and sinks.",q8H1N3zrUyO336izK_WDPQ,1,0,3,IdAZMWRpSW4dgWSdkBJSZw

 It's a pretty cool place, loved the music and the mechanical bull! 

The service really didn't stand out to me as amazing so, that's why I gave it a 4. 

BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE , I would come back!! :D",Kn88TcAZphREn-yKqerPbw,0,0,4,RL3S3kvm_6oEmVSvYNmyew

I had the grilled salmon over kale with deep fried green tomatoes. It tasted fishy, probably because I just came back from my vacation in Alaska and the salmon there was to die for. What made up for the 'blah' food was the mechanical bull that my son got on for free, we just tipped the operator. That was the most exciting part of the dining experience. Expensive, but hey this is Las Vegas right?

The two stars is for the clean restroom.",ctWAuzS04Xu0lke2Rop4lQ,6,5,2,v3rDiD7lu0ZNiCYx6pdRmw
5596421,2012-06-03,0,SGPjYRy6x7R5ZlGa_nrskg,"Stopped in after a movie. I was never crazy about the Cadillac Ranch but since it was taken over by the Ranch House, we thought we'd give it a try. Being a beautiful  night we sat outside. Our waiter was excellent. I haven't had such good service in a long time. The food on the other hand, not so excellent. Very typical bar food. A little more greasy than most bars though. I definitely  can say we won't be stopping back here anytime soon, especially with The Yard House just below. 
I truely hope our waiter finds a better job, one more suited to his talents..",tuCE0__ZY_Yc3UIVe4JYlg,0,0,2,ebevFpoaZYQY_UUG2NpqlQ
5863142,2012-11-14,0,SGPjYRy6x7R5ZlGa_nrskg,"This really should get a 3.5 rating.  The food was good and deserved a 4 but the service was poor and deserves a 2.5.

RHK took over the old Cadillac Ranch--there is still the mechanical bull.  I guess by keeping the word 'Ranch' in your name, you are basically sticking to the same theme.

I had the cheddar brisket sandwich and would definitely recommend it.  The brisket came out very lean, surprisingly.  The experience takes a ding as it came out cold; thus, the low points for service.  Speaking of their service, it was extremely sloooooow even though the restaurant was practically dead.

From about 3:30, you have happy hour.  Cheap rates on beers and well drinks and 50% off the pizza and appetizers.  We ordered the pizza as our appetizer.  My party liked the pizza.  The crust was good and it came out cheezy.

Next time, i want to try the bbq potato chip nachos.  I saw another table order it, and it looked huge and fully loaded...",vNqJm3mlYnqxFrLBi_NViQ,2,0,3,RPolu5rJrt0i108FRZ4wVw
5893368,2012-05-25,0,SGPjYRy6x7R5ZlGa_nrskg,"Formerly Cadillac Ranch, the new restaurant's menu exceeds the so-so food served at Cadillac Ranch. While the menu focuses on country fare, they also have steak fajitas. The cole slaw packs a punch as it's topped with ""pop rocks"", which is surprisingly tasty. The decor seemed relatively unchanged, and the indoor/outdoor seating option is a plus.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,4,15ZVoOnyz-kPAVn9thMMAA
