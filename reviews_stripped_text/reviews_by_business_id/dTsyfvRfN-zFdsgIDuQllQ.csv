We had cocktails and then booked a  rez the next night.  We were not disappointed by the meal and service in the dining room. A hidden gem off the strip in the Orleans hotel.

139472,2016-04-22,0,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"I've been to A&B on several occasions since they opened.  The results have been inconsistent and hence the 3 star rating.  After 2 months in business, I would have hoped they ironed out any of these issues but it is not the case. 

Food quality has been been good with some hits and some misses.  Try some of the happy hour options.

Food preparation - particularly the steaks - is subpar.  For a place that specializes in steaks, I've been disappointed in the steak preparation.  A medium steak should not come medium rare or medium well.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the filet medium, it came medium rare. The server and manager noted that it was undercooked and returned it to the kitchen.  It came back browner on the outside and still medium rare in the middle.  The manager agreed that it was still undercooked but did nothing to address the situation.  Not the sign of a quality steakhouse.

Service - aside from the above - has been ok.  Jerry, the bartender/server, goes above and beyond to take care of his customers.  The review would be 5 stars if it could be based on his service.  Other servers have not been as efficient or as friendly.  The hostess seemed inept at times - telling me the bar area was full and I needed to wait 20 minutes for a table when there was an open table just behind the hostess station.  On one visit, the manager stood by the door and discouraged my entry indicating the restaurant was full and was standing room only.  The restaurant wasn't even half full and my party found seats in the bar area.  The manager should encourage business, not shoo people away.

My recommendation is give A&B a try but be prepared for possible food and service difficulties.  Better yet - go to the bar area and sit in Jerry's area.  The excellent service will help overshadow any other issues you might encounter.",VNmQ12LYwG16HAspOp7WeQ,1,0,3,KBPtCW2v84uL-CLW1wW_RA

We sat down and were greeted by a very friendly waiter. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and it was great. They serve delicious bread and crispy cheese crisps beforehand. 
The menu is set up so you order your beef and whatever you want on the side separately. They have some great side vegetable and potato dishes. 
For dinner I had the boneless beef short rib and Boursin mashed potatoes. The beef was cooked perfectly and was so tasty. It just melts in your mouth! The mashed potatoes had great flavor.

Alder & Birch was terrific!  I had the onion soup...wonderful! My husband had the tomato bisque and all he did was rave about it.  We both had steak, I had New York steak and he had porterhouse and we selected Bleu cheese au gratin potatoes and Brussels sprouts.  Sooo good.

The restaurant itself is located in the back of the casino behind glass doors that block the noise but allow you to look out to see all the action. Atmosphere is upscale but welcoming. Sat at the bar for social hour (4-6). There is a limited menu & some good drink prices but you can't order from the regular menu till 5.  

We ordered meatballs, bacon wrapped dates, & tuna. The meatballs were made from pork & Kobe. They were pretty tiny, not tender at all, and it there was way more pork than beef. Not something I'd get again. The dates were fabulous! Stuffed with Maytag blue cheese, wrapped in bacon with a balsamic drizzle. The perfect amount of sweet and savory. At 5:00 we ordered the ahi tuna appetizer. The tuna itself was nothing special. Very thinly sliced and lacking a lot of flavor but cooked well. It came with a cucumber dill sorbet that was wonderful. Very refreshing. The wine list needs a little work but there are some acceptable choices.

1255396,2017-03-05,1,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"When I hear ""Fine Dining"", I don't expect that it means ""Fine... just fine, but not great"".

The food was perfectly...fine. Nothing great, nothing bad.
Highlights were our Oysters (fresh and tasty), Scallops (just what you'd expect) and Boursin Mashed Potatoes (how can it miss?)

Not crazy about the creamed corn or the Halibut, which was overcooked. (I probably should have said something, and given them the chance to fix that - but I was more interested in my date than I was in the food at that moment). 

In my original review, I had included comments about the service being less-than-spectacular. I received a very kind and well-written response from member of the waitstaff - apologizing and legitimately explaining the circumstances of our visit. I find this to be so rare - and the letter so honestly written - that I'm revising my original  review, and adding a star.

I want my reviews to be totally honest - but I'm not a dick. If someone makes a real effort to fix things, then that counts for a lot. 

Our meal for two was almost $200 with tip. Not ridiculous for this kind of place - but for that kind of money, I want better than fine. But Even though this experience didn't quite get there, I have have high hopes for Alder & Birch.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,1,4,sGCuZ1fRuZUYR0Xr_LnNTA

Tempura Rock Shrimp $9
Sweet Chili Glaze, Chives, Shaved Greens
- My favorite item next to the dates.

Tempura Fried Calamari $9
Pepperoncini, Tomato Sauce
- Need salt desperately and some sort of shaved greens too. Fried pepperoncinis are awesome. I wonder if I could get half cala/half peppers ;)

Bacon Wrapped Dates $9

This time the service was very disappointing or should I say somewhat non-existent.  It took awhile before any server came and took our order. Then it seemed forever before we got our drinks. Once we got our drinks, she never came by to check on us to see if we wanted to order any more drinks. We even had to flag her down just to get the check. We thought this would be our regular watering hole but not after what we experienced.  Afterwards we did dine in the restaurant section hoping the service would be much better and it was. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I ordered the flat iron steak and it wasn't anything exceptional. My partner ordered the Wagyu Colette sirloin and the way it was cut and presented on the plate didn't look very appetizing. It definitely didn't look like any sirloin steak I had in the past. The flavor was good but the center portion was more rare than the medium he requested. Btw, on our first visit, we both ordered the classic filet and it was very good.

We got there at 7:30pm and as it got later, it filled up a little more. It is very bright inside, maybe a little too well lit.  It's modern decor and the elevator music was a nice touch.  There is also a lovely 'fire and ice' style fireplace to add to the ambiance.
Our server Ivan, was very nice but seemed to be the only one there for the wait staff, so service was a bit slow.
We had the ahi tuna for the appetizer and it was very good.  The bread basket that was brought out had a variety of selections.  All were tasty.
We had the special, which was a veal chop with julienne vegetables in a brown sauce, and it was fatty, but veal chops are anyway, so it was good.  My steak was a NY steak and while done the way I ordered it, it was served on a big white dish with a small grilled onion as the garnish. That was it. Looked quite sad. Who eats an onion?  The presentation left a lot to be desired and I think that a tablespoon of potatoes or rice would have more than completed the dish. But I get it, everything is a la carte here.
The grilled cream corn was good, not great, as I have read, and the creme brulee for dessert was good, but the brulee crust was not hot when served, as it should have been.  It came with a small scoop of raspberry sorbet, which was rather tart not sweet.
Overall, it was a decent meal and with only a lemon-lime soda to add to the cost, it was $135 before the tip.  Pricey.",FU_BUlXtbUQefXOSUt69_w,0,0,3,6ZZ1qNP9l5g_Ybsr--t9dA

bone in ribeye we ordered medium rare and sliced it came out unsliced the server brought it back it in and asked the kitchen to slice it but I guess the chefs are set in their own ways and didn't want to slice it so our server had to slice it for us at our table. What the hell? So the chefs run the place now? We are paying customers and they don't want to slice our steak for us??? And another thing the  steak came out MEDIUM WELL we didn't want to complain because it seemed like our server got into it with the kitchen already so we felt bad. This is a steak house how can you mess up STEAK?? A $50 ribeye? SMH we added the sautéed bone marrow $12 and there was barely anything on it. Very disappointing!!!!!!!!! 
Moving on The bacon wrapped dates stuffed with cheese was excellent it was my fav. 
Calamari - this was  weak and breading falling off the marinara sauce tasted like it was from a can.
Roasted root veg - lacked flavor whole pieces of carrots and beets. My friend liked it but the rest of us will pass on that.
Truffle lobster Mac- meh it was ok lacked flavor or salt I usually never add salt to anything I eat but this needed some.
Tempura rock shrimp- this was good nothing special I've had better

2256936,2016-04-14,4,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"I had to think for a bit before writing this review. Not because it was on either spectrum of good or bad but more so because it was a mix. 

Let me start by first saying i was shocked when i saw the restaurant especially since i was in the Orleans. At first sight it looks quite fancy and upscale so to say. The decor was modern, simple yet elegant. The welcoming zone was open and gave the feel of a posh uptown restaurant. 5 stars.

We had a reservation and we were a little early, I was a bit put off when they said we had to wait till our reservation time especially when I realized later more than half the restaurant was empty. Reservations are not required so it makes me wonder how long we would have had to wait if we just walked in. 2 stars.

Nonetheless, we waited and started with a drink at the bar. While we were waiting, a bartendar was experimenting with some drinks and poured a little taste for each guest sitting at the bar. That was nice, it got us all talking and chatting. Social discussions help create comfort. 

We were seated at our table (mind you 5 min after our set reservation time and 20 min after we arrived) which is when I realized the restaurant was half empty. Our server, Alex welcomed us right away, explained the menu and suggested a few items. Alex was extremely attentive, friendly and alert. He touched our table just the right amount of times. Our busser was also very attentive & friendly. So the first ""wow"" of the night was when the manager, Madeline came up to me and acknowledged my allergy to peanuts. One of the guests had asked the busser if any of the bread had peanuts since he had mentioned macadamia nuts in one of the many types of breads offered in the basket, which is how we assumed the manager was alerted. I know they do this in fine dining establishments which is why i was shocked when it was done here. We started with 2 dozen oysters which were fantastic! 5 stars.

I found a new wine I like too! We ordered 2 bottles of the Paraduxx. Loved it!! 5 stars.

I ordered th Australian lobster which came with 2 tails and I was quite pleased with how large they were. Alex even offered to detail them and take the meat out for me, nice added service.  5 stars. 

Other items at our table: 3 stars. 
ABCD Wedge salad - fresh and a healthy portion
Tomato Bisque soup - nice presentation, so-so flavor
Kobe beef meatballs - not impressed, tasted like any regular meatball
Bleu cheese potato scallops - doesn't taste like bleu cheese at all
Baked potato - huge potato
Truffle frites - just thin French fries
Button mushrooms and onions - great taste
Brussel sprouts - delicious!!

So let me say disclose this first, the table was comprised of people who are mostly food coniseours, a few whom also work in the fine dining aspects of F&B. It was quite a disappointment that everything (service, apps, wine) was pretty top notch until the steaks all came out. All the steaks (5 ordered) were ordered med rare, one came out well done and had to be sent back to be remade, one was rare and the other 3 were medium rare on the outside but the closer you got to the bone it was rare or well done on the inside. For being a steakhouse it was a bit of a disappointment for their signature cuisine. 2 stars.

Near the end of our meal most of us ordered after dinner cocktails or coffee. I had a sambuca and espresso which was presented quite nicely. Those that had coffee had asked for more but it never came. One of the guests had said I guess it doesn't matter anymore since they dropped the check. 3 stars.

Overall, the service was great with the exception of the very end. Alex was great and well educated on the menu & wine list. The lobster tails were delicious and a generous size. Presentation overall was above average. Steak not pleased. We maybe back since we are locals but with so many other steakhouses in Vegas and prices pretty much the same, a place needs to stand out and I'm not sure that occured this trip.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,8,1,3,oGofDYQhN2PVwIQfPws6ig

Restaurant was empty, we were seated right away and the service was prompt and friendly all night long.  We spent about 2 hours there, and later on, about 6:30 p.m., they got really busy.  Their level of busyness never detracted from our service however, always prompt and friendly.  The busser especially was friendly and helpful and talkative, even grinding fresh coffee beans for my coffee at the end of the meal.  Our server was Justin, who did a good job.  

We had the shrimp appetizer, which was expensive at $16, but we got a lot of shrimp, and they were very well prepared.  We both liked the appetizer a lot.  Both my wife and I got steaks, she the ribeye and me the USDA Prime New York strip.  Both steaks were prepared as ordered, and my NY strip was especially tasty.  We didn't get any of the toppings or sauces, as we think they detract from a really good steak, and these were really good steaks.  Use the toppings and sauces at Sizzler.  We ordered the pommes frites (tiny french fries with truffle oil flavor) and brussel sprouts for side dishes.  They were both really good, and we didn't finish all of them.

We used to eat at Canal Street, the previous restaurant in this same location.  The A&B interior design is much brighter, which was fine with us.  There is lots of dark wood to tone the brightness down a little bit.  We both think that the food at A&B is better than at Canal Street.  Our steaks were excellent, and they were the main attraction.

2807793,2017-04-26,0,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars on this one.  I went with 4 stars as a hat tip to all the fine meals I have had at Boyd hotel restaurants, but I have to admit that I was disappointed.

First impressions:  The hostess was pleasant and seated us immediately.  The drinks were a bit slow in coming, but they were a reasonable pour and not overpriced.  The bread basket was French bread with a piece of flatbread thrown in - not terribly innovative, but acceptable.

Our first courses were better than average, although not great.  The onion soup had an unusual flavor, which I thought was interesting but my wife didn't care for it.  Our two salads - watermelon and wedge - were tasty but not stand outs.  My wife's main course was the scallops, and she thought they were excellent.  We also very much enjoyed sharing sides of creamed corn, blue cheese scalloped potatoes, and asparagus.  

That brings me to my entree, which was the big disappointment.  I had what was supposed to be a bone-in rib eye steak.  When it arrived, it looked more like what you would get on your plate if you ordered the $9.95 steak and eggs at Denny's.  It tasted like that too.  The color was consistent with the medium rare I had ordered, but the toughness said otherwise and it was bland.  The Bearnaise sauce was the only saving grace for the steak - it was one of the best I have had.  I'm not a butcher, but I have eaten a lot of rib eye steaks, and I would swear this was just a sirloin.

The room was also somewhat odd.  It seemed to be mostly bar and banquet tables, with a few  dinner tables scattered around where they could find room.  There had obviously been some money put into decorating the room, but the look was still chaotic and confusing.  Fortunately, the banquet table for about 25, which dominated the area where we were seated, was empty - otherwise it would have been really noisy in there.

Our server, Alex, was professional and helpful.  Not a big chatterbox by any means, but he did his job properly.  

As I said, I usually like the restaurants in Boyd hotels very much, but the next time I want a steak in one of them I will go a mile north to the Gold Coast and have dinner at Cornerstone.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,0,4,N4ijMLpUFfkJPsUdUxVomQ

Beef Carpaccio - The meat was marbled so nicely and topped with an arugula salad and capers. It was perfectly salted, I could've just eaten 3 orders of this and had been happy.

Tomato Bisque - I am not a big fan of any kind of tomato soups, however, their bisque was so good. It was creamy, but still light and topped with crème frache in the shape of a heart, which I though was cute. I didn't want to share.

Lamb - We ordered it medium rare, and it came out looking so. After taking the first bite, it was cold. The server offered to warm it up, but we were hungry. Meh.

Steak with Rock Shrimp - My steak was tender and at the right temp. The Rock Shrimp was alright, nothing amazing.

The inside is very nice and has fireplaces, and even its own restrooms (rare for a restaurant inside a Strip resort). Our waiter was professional and his assistant was friendly and struck conversation with us.

The food itself was good, but I'm not sure justified the price. Most of my party ordered steaks, and I had boneless short ribs. My ribs were tender (akin to potroast meat). My cousins ordered fairly large cuts of steak, though one medium-rare was clearly overcooked (we opted against asking for a remake, since we didn't want the overcooked steak to go to waste). To be honest, the sides were probably the highlight of the meal, with tasty roasted root vegetables and a lobster mac & cheese full of real lobster meat. 

We also tried two desserts, and the cheesecake was better than the bread pudding in our opinion.

Now for the food. The half dozen oysters were flavorful and a good start to a massive dinner. I had to try the tomato basil bisque based on a fellow Yelpers review and I'm glad I did. One of the best tomato basil bisques I've ever had. Then there was the 8oz filet Mignon that I had to get topped with grilled portobelleni mushrooms with a side of peppercorn sauce. Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare), although a little plain in flavor, but perfect with a dab of the peppercorn sauce. I didn't have much room for the sides we ordered, grilled cream corn and grilled asparagus but from what I did have I can tell you that they were flavorful and complimented the steak well. And usually we order wine with our steaks but decided to give their handcrafted cocktails a try. The maple manhattan was amazing. Oh and that bacon inside? Delicious! I don't even like manhattans but wow I'd make an exception for this one any day. 

Overall a great cocktail and steakhouse at a very good price. We'll definitely be back to try out other dishes on their menu. Can't wait!",ga_05brEylDLIabc3lZOgA,5,3,5,8yjbh9vqCBxw1196ArXMUg

Hopefully the management won't write this off as just someone looking for a freebie (I don't I just want a better experience the next time
I come in).  I wish I could send this to them privately but it's unclear who runs this restaurant.  Boyd?  I just want to help them improve so here goes.  

So first awesome food and fantastic service.  Absolutely 5 stars.  Zero complaints and everyone should go here.  

However, beware.  If you want to finish your drink and it's closing time (11pm) they will kick you out.  Rudely.  Seriously this is a get the F out screw you experience.  When then close they close.  So I guess come to dinner early like really really early.  Otherwise you'll be finishing it in the casino.  Doesn't matter how much you tip or how often you come in, it's get the F out we want to go home.  :(

I hope they change this and at least take care of their guests that are still in the restaurant, it's fine to close the doors but unfortunately for then if you're still in there after they close they will rudely make you leave.

Seriously that's food and beverage 101.

Let me be clear I love this restaurant and it's the best one in the Orleans. I will come back because no one is perfect.  We all make mistakes and we can all improve.   I hope they take this as constructive feedback and get their act together.  I promise I'll upgrade this if they improve.",yzUbxWyFhoxV8hvHr0ZG9g,2,0,2,3QfEo_isGNuAMw2AbDRNtQ

My boyfriend & I come here pretty often, but I keep forgetting to post a review. We've been to a few steak houses in different casinos & this by far is one of our favorites. Beautiful settings right when u walk in with a cozy ambiance while you're dining. Their menu is a little pricey , but of course the quality of the food is worth it all. Tonight we started off with the dozen seasonal oysters (which is a must wherever we go), tomatoe bisque (the best we've had), & a Caesar salad(pretty basic). Oh yea & they automatically bring u a little variety bread basket with house made butter. So yummy. For our entrees we ordered a med rare grass fed ribeye Oscar style & the salmon with crawfish tails & spinach. The Oscar style on the ribeye is an add on that goes on top of the steak which is asparagus, crab meat, & bernaise sauce. Bomb! The salmon was cooked to perfection & was still moist in the middle. Our sides were the button mushrooms with onions & the blue cheese scalloped potatoes. We never forget to order the blue cheese scalloped potatoes! This definitely is a must try side. To top off our dinner & almost send us in to a food coma, we went in on their chocolate decadence mess dessert . Omg delicious!

3971711,2016-04-17,7,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"Alder & Birch has replaced the Canal Street restaurant that I used to go to and liked a lot.  If you knew Canal Street, when you see A&B, you'll notice a big change.  Alder & Birch is bright and modern when compared with the darker, river themed wall of Canal Street.  I decided to give Alder & Birch a try.

I made a reservation and got there just about one minute before.  I was taken to a table that could seat three people with two of the seats being booth seating.  I sat in the chair.  I was given the menu and my server soon appeared.  Her name was Brandy and she was excellent!!

I ordered the tomato bisque soup, the signature, 14 ounce A&B porterhouse (ordered blue), fries for the side, and later strawberry shortcake for dessert.  

I was quickly brought my iced tea and some bread.  They had a nice selection of sliced bread, some lavash, and a focaccia square.  Along with the bread was a round dish with soft butter and another dish with large salt crystals for those, like me, who like salted butter.  The focaccia was hands down the best of the bread service.

The tomato bisque soup was very good and served extremely hot which was good!  I took my time with the soup and enjoyed the focaccia.

Next came the porterhouse along with the blue cheese topping I ordered with an up-charge of $4.  The fries were placed on the table and it was explained that the ketchup was jalapeño flavored and if I wanted regular ketchup I just needed to ask.  Not being a ketchup fan, I tried two fries with it and I was unimpressed.  I didn't taste the jalapeño zing I expected and it was just ketchup.  I enjoyed the rest of the fries without dipping.  The steak was done the way I like and the Maytag blue cheese topping was very good.  There was one large pearl onion grilled and served with the steak.  The meat near the bone came right off.  If it wouldn't have been messy, I would have gnawed the little bit left and cleaned the bone.

Brandy brought the dessert menu.  Some of the desserts were somewhat standard so I went for the strawberry shortcake.  Brandy explained that it wasn't cake at all but white chocolate bread.  It didn't matter--i wanted to try something different and it was.  Their strawberry shortcake consists of two slices of Bon white chocolate bread, grilled, and served with strawberries and vanilla bean ice cream.  There was a partial rose petal done in thin chocolate accompanying the dish.  I've had Bon Breads white chocolate at home and either they have changed or the grilling changes the bread but there was little chocolate flavor to the bread.  There was a good grill flavor but the dessert is essentially grilled toast with strawberries and ice cream.  Good but just OK.

Some things about Alder & Birch.  I like the modern decor but the lighting could have been turned down some.  It's bright in there and there was no rheostat to darken the dining area and give it a more intimate atmosphere.  It was modern wood, glass, and light.  I don't want it dark so I need my iPhone to read the menu but I'd rather not have it the way it was.

My server, Brandy, was excellent!  She was always there to replace my iced tea, answer questions, or see if I needed anything.  The people working with her was just as good.

The dinner was good and A-OK as Yelp says for three stars.  I don't think it wowed me enough to bring me back especially the lighting.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,20,7,3,G2y8S3y4-dNsS-ez1kutsw

Because my husband and I were looking for tapas more than a heavy dinner, we ordered appetizers and sides instead of entrees.   The braised short rib appetizer was to die for!  Order it if you're even slightly inclined. It was served on mushroom caps which were equally delicious. Though I've had better elsewhere, the crab cakes were also worth ordering, as was the carpaccio - though I did use the lemon from the crab cakes to add a touch of acid the dish needed. The mashed potato and blue cheese scalloped potatoes I would definitely order again.  The Brussels sprout side, while happily generous with the pecans and savory onions, was lacking both acid and salt.  The Kobe meatballs were meh - the gravy was heavy when it could have been bright, and the meatballs were on the dry side.  Overall, I highly recommend a meal here if you find yourself at or near The Orleans.",FEJoMCEzogMqcLB2-__2Qw,0,0,4,vIZSFetNYsyx89beAzqSYQ

I am generally not a fan of casino dining, which greatly limits this little foodie's options. Most places do not understand that many people prefer a more subdued atmosphere for dinner. Alder & Birch has it right.  When you walk into Alder & Birch, the doors close behind you, sealing off the stench & noise of the casino. 

We had drinks in the foyer, where you can people watch from behind your glass wall. Very entertaining. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and placed in the capable hands of Ivan.

We ordered every appetizer on the menu excluding the ocean treasures and the oysters.  The braised spare ribs looked horrible and tasted how they looked!  The shrimp however was delicious.  The Kobe meatballs weren't anything special but were better than the spare ribs.  
For those with children they have no children's menu or small portion section.  I ordered the Bone in rib eye (22 oz) and shared it with 3 children.  The French fries (Pontus frites) were a hit with the kids.  The creamed corn was mediocre (definitely not Lawreys) the mashed potatoes and lobster Mac were good.

A friend tried this restaurant last year and raved about it to our tennis team, so for my sister-in-law's birthday we decided to give it a shot. And I'm thrilled that we did! 
The chic interior is a welcome break from the glittering lights and frantic noise of the casino. Although our table was already prepared when we arrived early, we took a few minutes to check in at the bar and wait for the rest of our party. The bartender, Brandon, was better than even your best idea of what a bartender should be. He was charming and engaging, and asked questions in an effort to craft cocktails each of us would enjoy. He even managed to create something for our friend who hates the taste of alcohol, which we thought could be an impossible task! When we were ready he helped escort us to our table, and introduced us to our server Alex and runner Javier. Alex was attentive without hovering, and gave excellent recommendations. Plus, I would clone Javier if I could. He was sweetly hilarious and gracious, and always nearby when we needed anything...and we needed a lot of things over the course of a couple hours! 
When we finished, but weren't quite ready to end the evening, Brandon recommended we check out Bailiwick's for live music and billiards, which was also great, and also significantly cooler than anything else in there I can remember.

4456848,2016-04-23,0,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"We stayed 2 nights at the Orleans on our recent trip to Los Wages and we decided to try Alder & Brich.

I recently got the app Open Table and made our reservations a week before leaving.  (The app worked.  I'm an app noob so yeah take if for what it is lol)

Walking it, I must say we were really impressed.  The decor was really cool!

The hostess who sat us was so super sweet.

Our server was the best server I've encountered in a long while and his name was Ivan.

In addition to Ivan, there was another young gentleman I think his name was Race who also really super nice.

It's a bit noisy and you can hear other people's conversations pretty well.  My husband came to the conclusion that it was because the table is too big so people have to talk louder to be heard.  

I just thought it was because the tables were too close to one another lol

My husband and I are the kind of people that love bread baskets.  As soon as it hits the table my husband starts checking it out immediately.  There was one particular item in their bread basket that we both loved and I think it was a Parmesan Lavosh.  It was super yummy and we ate it all, lucky for I took a picture before it was gone.  My husband also like the bread that had the white chocolate in it.  I didn't get to try it.

We decided to have the Crab Cakes for our appetizers.  Now I love raw fish, poke, sahimi but cooked fish or shellfish, I'm not a big fan of.

Crab Cakes came and I was like uh oh.  If you are fan of crab, then you will like this a lot.
Where's the filler that normally masks the crab taste?????  Well there's really no filler, just crab.

So I had to pass it over to my husband who inhaled it and said wow that was the best crab cakes he ever had!  

For our entree, my husband went with the Boneless Beef Short Ribs and I selected the Double Cut Kurobata Pork Chops.

Ivan had asked me how I wanted my Pork Chops done and I kind of stared at him for a bit as I always thought pork chops were always cooked well done.  He suggested that I try medium, it would be a little pink but it would be nice and moist.  So I went with medium.

I never cook pork chops at home because well, they're always hard and now I know why lol

Ivan really knew what he was talking about, the pork chop was so moist and full of flavor.  I actually fell in love with pork chops that night.

My husband loved it too.  

My husband's dish was yummy and rich.  The sauce was hearty and just the right amount of seasoning.  My husband said he would have it again the next time we come back.

For our sides we selected the grilled asparagus and the grill cream of corn.

My husband had read other reviews prior to our trip and everyone that ordered the grilled cream of corn seemed to love it, so that's why we ordered it.

And they were right!  OMG, we've never had anything remotely close to this before and it was awesome!  Who knew grilled corn could taste so sweet and be firm and not mushy.  It was so awesome that we were still talking about their Grilled Cream of Corn on the plane ride home.

For dessert we had the Spumoni and coffee, which rounded out the best meal that we had during our entire vacation.

My rating:  5

My husband:  4.5  

But since this is my Yelp account, they get a big 5!

Scallops were delicious & very large. Like tenderloins. Filet was very good, very good wood flavor from off of the grill. The steak was cooked just a touch over my medium rare request but very good nonetheless. Also ordered Brussel sprouts which were good but nothing special. Price for everything was very good. Don't want to deal with the wait or prices at some of the more haute steakhouses, then I'd say give this a try.

4639573,2018-03-06,0,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"From the moment we arrived at the Orleans Casino complex we were treated cordially and efficiency.  The restaurant is reasonable walking distance inside the casino which is important to me as I walk w/a cane.  The decor is subtle and sophisticated.  The front bar is comfortable with chairs & tables by an open fireplace or stools at the stylish bar.  The bartenders were affable without being intrusive.  A selection of house-made cocktails sounded fun to try but we held out for wine with dinner.  The bar liquor selection is adequate but not extensive.

Our party of 3 was seated promptly.  The menu has an emphasis on cuts of beef from different sources.  Appetizers were enough for us to share.  The shrimp cocktail had large tiger prawns.  I asked for the remoulade sauce to try as I'm on the hunt for the perfect remoulade.  A&B's is very close!  The 3-onion soup was available without cheese and was extremely flavorful. Our filets were cooked as requested, ""rare to medium rare.""  Prices were fair for an upscale restaurant with excellent quality beef and attentive wait staff.

A well-rounded selection of wine by the glass was well-met by us all.  It gave us a chance to try something new without the commitment of a bottle.

All 3 of us splurged on desserts:  the flourless chocolate cake was very interesting while the creme brulee was spectacular.

All in all, we had a lovely, gracious dinner with the chance to not be hurried by the waiter.  Cost was just under $100/person.",X_E6p2LrbS4vH1Uz9IhEVQ,0,0,5,4Nf4s3M2Kmp8Ybst61sj4Q

When we were discussing where to go it came up that we definitely would not go back to Alder and Birch. The food was good, not great. But what made this a one star restaurant was the service. I also noticed when management responded to negative reviews they always said, "" next time you come in, notify us of a problem."" Really? Do they expect people who were treated poorly to come back? My complaint has to do with disliking a drink. Most high end restaurants would take it away and offer something else. Me, I was told next time to order something else.

Alex had suggested a bottle of wine to try and it was very good with my New York steak and 3 onion soup. Alex suggested we try the creme brûlée for dessert and I'm glad he did. I think it was the best I've ever had! Would recommend to anyone if they love to fancy wine and dine and great service. 10/10!,CZBE_VJPHPRxPQTA6HF_cA,1,0,5,sIx-Ov7B8GQoGykwkDfN6A

First impression,upscale and clean. Everyone I came in contact with was courteous and friendly. First up was the french onion soup. The only thing is the soup was not 100% heated through,however it was fine I really didnt mind not scalding my mouth. The soup was an 8. Next up was the new york steak paired with a lobster tail. The steak was cooked precisely as requested and was excellent. I would rate that a 10. The first half i ate as served the second half i had them bring me a peppercorn sauce. However ,they have many options on how you would like the steak topped ask your server. The lobster tail was good,I would rate that an 8. Not too big,not too small..just right..flown in fresh..not frozen. I also ordered asparagus on the side,of course it was a larger serving,couldent finish it but was typical asparagus. For dessert ,I ordered the bread pudding,was excellent,rate it a 9. had a coffee as well. The server,I want to say his name was alex? sorry if i got that wrong he was great,attentive but not overbearing. Price wise,compared to comparable steak houses on the strip this place is an absolute bargain. I had a full course meal and it was tough to get the bill up to 110. As you may or may not know there are places on the strip where you pay 110 just for the steak. To sum it all up this is an excellent option for the steak experience in las vegas. steak houses are plentifull and numerous. I would rate this as one of the best values in las vegas. If you want to have an excellent meal at a fraction of the cost then I would definetly make time to come here for a meal that I am sure you will enjoy !",O5VAQ-dbR2Bk0OZLL1L0Ig,1,0,5,aR_i7X-tX8FiH3LyNNRg_w

The Orleans did a fantastic job by adding this fine dining establishment, fabulous food,  delicious cocktails & excellent service. While dinning here several times, we tried various items on the menu, we enjoyed ourselves immensely.

4920734,2016-02-20,3,dTsyfvRfN-zFdsgIDuQllQ,"Alder & Birch is the new and improved steak house at The Orleans casino. If you think they simply changed the name (from Canal Street) and put some new items on the menu, you're wrong. They completely redid the layout and created a nice, hip steakhouse that would be perfect for a date night or business dinner. 

Items that we enjoyed: Kobe beef meatballs, ahi tuna, watermelon salad, filet, seabass, & the bread basket lol
Items that we did not enjoy so much: Roasted Bone Marrow as it was dry and not much marrow to rub on the crostini. Lobster Mac & Cheese did not have much flavor and we didn't like the elbow macaroni pasta that they used. 

Service from Ivan was amazing.. He was personable, knowledgeable on the menu, and was not overly attentive to the point of annoyance. Some of the server assistants and food runners seemed a bit nervous so hopefully they gain more confidence over the shifts.
Jerry at the bar was also great. They didn't have blue cheese stuffed olives for my dirty martini so he took the time to hand make them. He even dropped off a few extra to the table since he knew I liked them so much. 

I'm excited to go back to try their Happy/Social Hour in the bar area by their fireplace!

The selection of side dishes will please anyone and can feed 2-3 people. The grilled cream of corn with a birch syrup crust was $7. It is not your typical cream of corn. This one was not a cream style. Lobster mac and cheese with truffle Oil was $12.00.

The food was very good but not spectacular.  My wife had the surf and turf and it was great. My Diver Scallops was very good.  Presentation of the meals was unremarkable considering the price.  I would have anticipated a bit more flamboyance.   White simple plates that our server reminded us were very hot.  Now let me get to my 2 Star rating.  At the recommendation of our server my wife had the Lavender Kiss.  It's a champagne based cocktail which he highly recommended. After a few sips of the drink she decided it wasn't to her liking.  When the server approached and asked us how we liked our drinks she told him she didn't like the drink.  He said he was sorry to hear that and suggested if she wanted another drink that she should try the Sangria.    Now at this point I was anticipating that our server would have not just suggested but would have on his own taken the Lavender Kiss and got my wife a new drink of her choice.   That didn't happen.   When I got our bill, I got what i expected.   The $10 Lavender Kiss was still on the bill.   Well, there are some fine places to dine in Las Vegas. I suggest looking closely at Gallaghers at NY NY and Mastro's where you will pay the same for better food, service and ambience.      

Read your response to my review.   Of course we could complain when or if we went back and had poor service.  But with a restaurant that hopes to compete with the Greats of Las Vegas I shouldn't have any complaints. We won't be back.",7ulf0EAfpg_W58U_KzWq3w,0,1,1,CJD7_Vkn8yqg4g_PAEaFpA
