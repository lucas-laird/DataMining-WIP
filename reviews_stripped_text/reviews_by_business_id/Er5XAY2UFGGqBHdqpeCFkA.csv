The prices are great during happy hour. Usually the service is great when we get served by an asain girl with short hair or a white girl who happily serves us but the last few times we got this bigger guy. I accidently ordered a seaweed salad instead of the cucumber salad last time he served us literally 3 minutes later as i realized it, the server was no where to be found and it was coming to the table oops that was my bad i guess.... (i dont know if it was that because i was so nice and apologetic) we almost felt like he was avoiding us after that the only time he asked if we needed anything was to take our order and once towards the very end, he would fill our waters and leave without seeing if we needed anything else or how it was not even making eye contact. He wasn't busy he had like 3 small tables and was standing by the host stand. The asain girl checked up on us more then him. I work in the food service industry and this was dissapointing how his service was inattentive.  I felt kind of uncomfortable. Oh well ill still go back hopefully he's nicer or we get the girls lol.",cB5SxWRv33xgilnJAPJOjw,0,0,4,sJL2KWOX0kA8Q-6KElhoww

Tonkatsu ramen was also good. The broth wasn't salty. I would not order the udon at this place. It looked and taste like the udon packet we buy at an asian store.

I would have given this place a 5 star if it wasn't for one of their employee. 

The girl at the reception desk was the rudest person my group had to deal with. If you do not like you job, don't take it out on your customers. 

We had a group of 8 and when we got there, there were plenty of seats open. We asked the girl to put out name down and she said its a 20 minute wait. We ask if we could sit separate to make it easier and faster to be seat and all she said was give me a minute and rolled her eyes at us. We waited 15 minute and asked her how much longer do we have to wait and she would not reply. A group of 7 people came and she sat them right away. We asked she why we can't get seated when half the restaurant was free and she said they have a list of people waiting before us. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE! This girl said we can't get seated because the other people are not there yet for their dinner reservations. Ten minute later and yet no one else showed up. We finally got seated after another girl came to take over the position.

Horrible hosted! Other then her, our waiter was great and very informative!",scPAxI9yQ_CPRC8N_5oGxg,0,0,4,So5Solzw9ItTkQZWB00ocA

The slight difference between the two is that Zenshin's menu is more Japanese focused. I just learned recently that they're under the same management, what a coincidence!  I'm all about the island fusion flavor so I had high hopes. The layout and seating was quite clean and modernized with a centered sushi bar. We were a party of six, and gorging is what we came for. It's an Asian Hog Feast is what I call it. So the dinner started with Ahi Poke Tacos, Eggplant fries, fried calamari, dynamite green mussels, fried soft shell crab, and tons of mouth watering rolls specifically the 8 second bull ride. The eggplant fries and ahi poke tacos was the highlight of the appetizers. If you're itching for ramen or anything soup base, try the oxtail soup or the Ton Katsu ramen. :)",0S6OtXUGAZX__HuXlqIO0g,0,0,4,wG_RRSMJKksnm3_Tq-kdEg

Not a busy crowd at that time and it's a pretty spacious restaurant so I'm liking it already. Right away I'm greeted by Leo who is by the way a genuinely very social person and good sushi chef. Whenever I look at the menu I'm never really sure what I want. So I'm always open to suggestions. And Leo made his right away! Most of the rolls were $3-$4 and they had some that were five or six.  I had their 777 roll, Salmon poke, fried oysters. $2 for Asahi beer! Pretty good rolls. I looked over their entire menu and they have a full selection and a few interesting menu items. Overall the service was very friendly. Most importantly though the service was very quick from Leo. Of course there weren't very many people in his section. But I don't know how many times I've sat down in a restaurant that didn't have a lot of people in there, yet the service seemed very slow. And sometimes when I'm dining alone I don't seem very talkative, but he got me to be social. He also let me know what was going on at the Southpoint and not just at Zenshin, such as the $5 movie specials at the movie theater.

The tonkotsu ramen:
- Braised pork in the ramen was amazzzzzing!

Misoyaki black cod:

777 roll:
- I was weary about ordering anything with soft shell crab because I had never had it before but it was soooo good! 

Spicy tuna roll:
- A classic staple. Always good. :)

Len Ying drink: (I think that was what it was called)
- Really interesting. It is a hibiscus flavored drink that was recommended by our bartender. Never had anything like it!

Strawberry cocktail of some sort:
- Also really interesting. Very very tasty! I was skeptical because it had muddled fresh strawberries and a thai chili inside but it ended up being so good!

Green tea tiramisu:
- A nice light dessert after a big meal. :) 

Mini malasadas: 
- Served with a dollop of custard and chocolate, it was the perfect dessert to share along with the green tea tiramisu. 

The owners did Zenshin right. Food and service was amazing! We especially enjoyed the company of Katie, our bartender/server. She was very personable and accommodating. When in Vegas, I would definitely go again!

I'm an avid sushi eater. I know the difference between a good quality fish or not. I ordered assorted sashimi, and it doesn't taste fresh at all. It's chewy. A good sashimi supposed to feel like it ""melts"" on your mouth.

Another failed dish: Spicy Tuna Bowl. Not authentic at all and they smothered it with thick layers of unappetizing mayonnaise-based sauce.

The okay dishes I tried were beef teriyaki bento box and tempura. The bento box was honestly, a good value. Comes with rice, pickled cucumbers, roasted kombucha, and salad. Good portions of food and taste was standard.

Service was meh. The hostess was your typical teenager with attitude. 
The server was friendly at first, but then gets too friendly afterwards. I know she was just doing her job to give me recommendations, but she's pressuring me too much. She offered dessert for like three times and every time she ask, I would have to say 'no' multiple times. 
The chef.. was too slow.. It wasn't even crowded. There were only about three tables out..

Bottom line.. If you have to eat here, just order the Bento Box sets. It's the only one that's worth it. If you want to order sushi, don't expect it to be fresh or in a good quality.",OVKWEfQLseKcdn9iV2aiwQ,0,0,2,cAy3UMTxATheDDgNPLWkwQ

I went there by myself this one night, this hostess refused to seat me...she asked me to rather sit at the counter, or to just stand there to wait while there were many empty tables available.  I asked her about those tables, she told me they were reserved, which was a lied.  Because no ones ever came in for it.  Then this waitress named 'Jane', the biggest rude air head I have ever seen.  And here's come this food runner, absolutely rude, rude, rude.  'Rude' is probably his last name.  I believe those people have never received any kind of training before working there.  Although these two managers were running around the whole place acted like they were real busy.  But then again, if they were doing such a good job/management, why would the place be so bad?  The sushi were not fresh, they should not be serving it at all.  I am the kind of person who look for quality, especially when it comes to sushi.

1060485,2013-07-11,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"Zenshin is located within South Point, an already great casino hotel.  What would make it better, one would wonder?  A great Asian restaurant, yes!  During my four day reservation at South Point, for the first two days, the family went to Zenshin to try out some good Japanese food.  It worked!  The food tasted great, and it came at a pretty low price.  Also, I know I say this quite often, but I rarely experience bad service: the staff came by, did not neglect us, and did not annoy us.  We never had to return anything.  The atmosphere was like the rest of South Point itself: clean, roomy, yet modern and smoke smell free.
     Food quality:  In Japanese, the literal meaning of ""Zenshin"" is ""advancement, progression, or moving forward"", as can be seen on the Zenshin restaurant page on the South Point website.  This food is truly progressive, in that it makes one consider: why can't all Japanese restaurants be half-decent? Good, tasty, but filling food indeed.  There exists a large selection of selection for but a few dollars per order, and some novel combinations.  Main dishes include such delicacies as Tempura Udon.  I genuinely enjoyed every bit.
     Food quantity:  Again, for only a few bucks, a very good quantity.  I think it's also AYCE, which comes at a great price as well.
     Service:  The staff here are like South Point staff themselves.  Also, cue the atmosphere.  Staff are personable, speedy/efficient, and seem truly intent on living up to the restaurant's name through making progress.
     Atmosphere:  The restaurant logo is a bright reddish sunset, which symbolizes the simplicity and efficiency of the Japanese culture, where the restaurant's dishes hold their roots.  The Japanese flag itself is to symbolize progress, so that's a good job done on Zenshin's part.  The interior itself doesn't reek of casino-ish smoke, which not even the actual lobby does.  The whole thing is modern, should I say.
     Overall:  For an Asian restaurant inside of a casino hotel spa, it sure delivers on its primary message: to make progress in not only Vegas, but the entirety of America.  It's a pretty good restaurant too, with a flair of uniqueness.  Definitely try it out if you're into sushi or different Asian food, which I am!

What made tonight's visit so terribly bad was the Zenshin manager and his 2 hosts wouldn't allow My brother-in-law in to the restaurant with his seeing eye dog. I guess he doesn't look ""blind enough"" walking around with his new pup- who was wearing a fully labeled GUIDE DOG harness! 

The manager asked for my brother's ""blind"" credentials and after reviewing his IDs insisted casino security come and verify his dog was a service dog and give her a pink tag. The manager said it was part of SouthPoint's new policy. What made it worse is the security guard came and kept asking ""what's the dog for? What's the service?"" To which we all had to reply ""He's BLIND!"" 

The cherry on top was the service was terrible and they didn't even offer to comp my brother a drink, appetizer or dessert for the inconvenience, embarrassment or harassment!! Seriously?! ?

Shame on Southpoint for being so ignorant of ADA rights and for being blind towards a blind man! Apparently, their ""new policies"" include discrimination towards the blind.

The Japanese noodles had an Indian type twist which was interesting. 

The lettuce wraps were boring.

1676116,2013-04-08,1,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"While at the South Point checking out the Glass & Bead Expo, I wanted to grab a quick lunch. I noticed the sign for Zenshin and it clicked that I had seen this under recently open businesses on Yelp. I made my way to the menu and was surprised at how extensive it is...they had anything from sushi to ramen on the menu. The prices seemed reasonable and they had bento boxes and lunch specials. I opted to give this place a try.

SERVICE: This is their weak point. Our server was nice, but not really on the ball. He was not well informed on the menu nor the drinks that they offer. When I received my bento box I had asked what the pickled vegetable was...he walked around asking three different people until he found out it was squash. Perhaps it was busy, or they're still working out the kinks, but this is their main area for improvement right now.

FOOD: Reasonably priced and delicious. The fish was fresh, the roll options vast and unique. They had several lunch specials and I really enjoyed my bento box. I had couple of classic rolls such as cucumber roll and california which were priced accordingly between $5-6 per roll. I had one speciality roll Tuna Mango Passion and that was $13. Their speciality rolls were between $10 - 13. I generally don't like fruit on food that is suppose to be savory, but this roll was very well executed. I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki bento box. It came with miso soup, salad, steamed rice, pickled squash, and a generous piece of salmon in light teriyaki sauce. This was a great deal for $11.

AMBIANCE: This is an open restaurant inside of a casino. It is definitely noisy. The decor is very sleek and modern, and the restaurant is spacious so personal space even at the sushi bar isn't an issue.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,6,5,4,SBD56dPrK0_SJqS3G6sAzA

The decor was Asian inspired and everything looked clean and organized. 

The hostess led me to the bar and offered me the happy hour menus. For drinks, I ordered a water and a strawberry bangkok (strawberry colada - patron silver, malibu coconut, fresh sweet n sour, fresh muddled strawberries with a thai chili pepper inside) which were brought out to me quickly. The sushi chef behind the counter took my order of teriyaki beef slider (thinly sliced beef, asian slaw & spicy miso sauce), hoisin pork belly with bao buns (pickled vegetables, green onions & cilantro), and a crunch roll (shrimp tempura, crab, avocado roll, topped with crunchies & eel sauce).

I enjoyed the strawberry bangkok drink and the crunch sushi roll was delicious. I had to force myself to slow down and not inhale the roll. I enjoyed the teriyaki beef slider more than the bao buns. The bao buns weren't terrible at all, they were okay. Just not my style.

Both the food and service during happy hour were a joy to me, especially after the terrible happy hour I received at another place, so I definitely want to come back to Zenshin. Heck, I even want to come back here when it's not happy hour, that's how much I liked it.",vLUHU5KxoB_CzLSHLkwz-g,1,0,5,8O_pNor4d0AFoh3pxXJUhg

I saw Karage Chicken, Salmon Poke, California Rolls included in HH menu.  I ordered the pork belly bao buns which were really good! The bun was soft, the pork belly was a little too crisp though. 3 appetizer sized came in a fancy platter. Unfortunately my phone had low bat so no foodporn for this review.
 
The menu I was given was primarily sushi and a few beef/chicken bowl options. I didn't see any bento boxes as my choice. Come to find out later that is only on the dinner menu?  So I ended up with eggplant fries and the beef teri as my entree since I don't really care for sushi...(yeah I know blasphemy)
 
The Eggplant fries: YAY!....  The Teriyaki bowl: NAY! ... I really like these fries!!  Veggies dipped and fried in a light tempura batter and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. For sure I would order this again. Very good!  The Teri bowl though, not so much. The sliced beef pieces I had was a little dry and tough and the teriyaki sauce was too thick and salty for me.

Location: Inside South Point Casino next to Steak N Shake. You can either sit at the sushi bar or the tables and booths surrounding it. There is also another dining room but it was not being used at the time.
  
Service: Staff is still lacking in finesse department. Service started out fine but after I got served my entree, I didn't see my server till I got my check. Granted he had to cover a lot of tables in his area, it was not that busy in my opinion.  I needed silverware and couldn't get his attention at all so after a few minutes went by I had get up and ask someone else. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot but a little acknowledgement can go a long way you know? 

Hopefully the kinks will get worked out cause I really would like to come back and try more items on that Happy Hour menu. That Lychee Martini sounds good.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,8,6,3,mxIq9wHOG3y4u1FW9xPbUA

The food was tremendously better than expected. I ordered a tempura roll, with the chicken teriyaki entree and my boo ordered the hibachi salmon. Both entrees included miso soup (which I don't like in general), but our server was able to give me an extra serving of salad, instead of miso soup. The salad was exceptionally fresh! Although I'm a sushi virgin, the tempura roll was delicious ;-)  My teriyaki chicken was fresh and cooked to perfection. The chicken wasn't dry, like most dishes. Although I did not taste the salmon, it looked very appealing! The presentation of the dishes was admirable..

They never apologized for the wait or reassured us that they will help us soon. The hostess even seemed unsure about the situation when we asked how long we had to wait. It wasn't even busy. My friend was on a time crunch so we were hoping we could eat together for a little bit and she could leave. The wait lessened our time and my friend told the waitress she had to leave soon so she wanted her food to go. The waitress said she couldn't do that and explained that they couldn't let her bring it to go because people take advantage of the cheap price. But my friend didn't have time because of the wait and had only ordered one roll to go which is not taking advantage of the prices They messed up her order also which made her have even less time to eat. Our waitress only came back to us once when we asked for the checks. The only person who was friendly and made it a better experience was the guy who cleared our table and filled our waters.

I ordered the crunch roll which is okay compared to other sushi restaurants. The furakake salmon poke was good but would not be worth the price if it wasn't happy hour prices. I tried other restaurants that serve the same items that are better and aren't even Japanese restaurants. 

I would give the food another chance just because I can't judge the quality based on my 2 items I tried but hope the service wouldn't be as terrible as what I experienced.",NthmRgkXzbpd_NYNpwmbhg,0,0,2,FTyHjXcDhjknlw0kCaqbfQ

I will say though that the eggplant fries were phenomenal and the rest of the burger, including the house made bun, was on point. Just wish the meat in both our meals was a little better quality.

I asked her 3 times regarding seating and she gave me the same mono-toned answer to another question....like a programmed robot. Well, I put that aside and got seated by her at the worse possible seating. Though many booths were available, she put me and my wife at the sushi bar right next to the kitchen door on the end with my seat having no table space for the stack of menus which apparently are there normally. She had a smirk on her face which didn't help. We had a mind to walk out, but timing was upon us as we had pre-purchased movie tickets and needed to eat. So, a fantastic view of folks cooking and washing dishes, not to mention the extra ambiance of kitchen noise. Only good thing about this section was Jesse our server who was great and also two other staff members, even one who looked like the owner or manager in a nice suit came and filled my glass when it was empty. So that made for very good impressions on us. Regarding food, we are from San Francisco (right by the ocean), so we may be what some might consider ""sushi snobs"".....(this being the Nevada dessert), and the portions were rather small and flavor only passable. Too much cucumber in the California Roll, (SF restaurants have only avocado as the veggie, along with the crab and nori......never cucumber....filler?) Again, all our rolls were about 70% the size of what we get back home. After eating we made sure Jesse got a nice tip, and we ended our meal. Now just to make sure I got her name, I said a pleasantry to Miss Azure on the way out so I could see her name tag.......true to form, she half smiled and did not say a word...... So......I will recommend this place for a quick sushi fix but ONLY on Miss Azure's days off from work......not kidding, she really doesn't understand how to talk (or not talk) to customers....too bad she is in a service business. She easily ruined our meal experience with very poor customer service skills. Seriously, does anyone know if there is an opening at the DMV where she can apply for a position? It would be a perfect fit for her.....no lie.",YNFb1OOVN1UXyhdQ7gEY0g,1,0,2,hD_FQARBaGyztHRaMjSJ8Q

If I couldn't tell by the taste, I seen them wheeling it in air tight bags on ice during lunch.  I think the strengths that put this place over the top are the non-sushi items:

The black cod was crispy, flaked off the fork, was not dry at all.  In fact it is very succulent with zero ""fish"" taste.

Pork belly was totally fantastic.  Just get it is all I can say--find room for it, share it, whatever...  just try it.

The servers are good and an enjoyable bunch.  They definitely know their menu if you are not sure about something and are having trouble deciding.  They will tell you details and have had stuff on the menu themselves.

I am no paid food critic--but I am not some schlub who stuffs his gullet and has no concept of what is going on.  I'm pretty surprised with 1-3 star reviews but notice they tend to be closer to when the place opened so maybe the restaurant was working through some things at their opening.",5n5tu-jy4wuNhCStLxhWag,2,0,4,Fnea-jG9pfw6qefIuW8xTw

The tuna didn't look fresh (see pic), as you can tell by the color of the fish itself (not bright red but very pale). 
The 777 roll was supposedly spicy soft shell crab but again (please see pic), the majority of the filling was fake crab/kani and not the soft shell crab. The small amount of crab that it was in there was mushy and not have the texture of freshly fried crab. 

Quality was very low for a nice restaurant inside a (busy) casino. And I have to agree with my husband, people will check the restaurant out usually during happy hour.

I stay at South Point every year, and I was happy to see a sushi place open up.  It's not very busy yet, so we were able to sit down fairly quickly, but that's the last time anything happened in a timely fashion.   Everyone we talked to had pretty much the same thing to say, ""It's not my favorite place for sushi (which is XXXX), but it's here.""

The menu: It's got a good selection of sushi rolls and nigiri... but not much else.  Very little in the soup and noodles section, and for those who like a lot of tastes, there's only the 2 combinations... one sushi, one sashimi.

The food: The fish was certainly as fresh as you can get in Las Vegas.  The tako with the cucumber salad was just excellent.  The special rolls are small, especially for 12-14 bucks a pop.   Go somewhere else for your teri-bowl, too.. it was teri-ble.

The service: Here's where they really need some work.  The staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know much about how long things take.   We sat down, ordered inside 15 minutes or so, then proceeded to wait.  20 minutes later my wife's teriyaki beef bowl arrived.  15 minutes later her cucumber salad ""appetizer"" arrived.  15 minutes later my two special rolls arrived.   50 minutes from order to arrival... with no warning from the staff except apologies as it kept taking longer and longer... shows a complete lack of interest in setting expectations with the customer.

Another example of the same.  My wife doesn't eat sushi, so she asked about the teri-bowls.  ""They're both great!"" the waitress says, so we order the beef bowl.  It comes, but is very fatty and the meat was tough to chew, which we then mentioned to the waitress.  ""I do like the chicken better,"" she then adds.  Well, where was THAT when we were ordering?!

Finally, we ask for the check... which doesn't have the comps we mentioned both in line and at the time of ordering.  So we wait again for her to come back with a modified check... which only has one of the two comps on it.. again mentioned before.   I walk up to the register to get it fixed, and have the remainder billed to the room, which the cashier does without giving me a chance to tip.   Total time from first check to walking out... 10 minutes.

Will the place get better?  I have to assume so.  They're starting from a good food and presentation base, but it's pretty obvious they've got some kinks in the preparation line, as well as some staff to train better.",cwqYWgrPD4aLF4HB9ArtGw,3,0,2,-AyUzXdUIQv-h7Sg-QIgkw

We got there about 5pm and were seated immediately. Didn't get our waiter's name but he was an Asian guy with a bigger build and he was very attentive. Never did we sit around and wait for him to come and take our order, refill our waters, or get our check.

What we got:
777 roll, $6. Spicy soft shell crab inside, with spicy tuna outside topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. Gotta say I was expecting more like a spider roll as far as texture. Couldn't really tell it was soft shell crab. And with all the ""spicy"" in the description, it wasn't that spicy. 3/5

Hamachi kama (Yellowtail collar) w ponzu $5
They were out of the salmon collar so the waiter recommended this. It was actually really good and had a good amount of meat on it. The skin was nice and crisp, but make sure you eat it fast! 5/5

Fried oysters $5
Three pieces panko coated served with Yuzu aioli and tonkatsu sauce. Loved this as well! The oysters were very silky and still had a nice oyster taste. Some fried oysters I've had were overcooked till they fried the snot out of them.  I couldn't tell the aioli was yuzu flavored though. 4.5/5

Hoisin Pork Belly Bao $5
Served with pickled radishes. I was expecting actual pork belly slices. This was more like pulled pork. Also the Hoisin was very sweet to me. I preferred to use the tonkatsu sauce instead. 3/5

Including tax and tip, the two of us for this light meal was $27. Not too bad. Usually Happy Hours end up costing us at least $40 and then does not feel like a deal at all.  Even if we got drinks, we still would have gotten in under $40. Will def return!",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,1,4,2DYQnkoa79ogwKtxkvKatA

And the waitress even said it was really good, that's the atrocious part. No tomatoes as listed in the ceviche as well, not even any onion as it is normally made regardless of regional variation, so how was that ceviche at all? For $6 I could have assembled that on my own from a quick trip to walmart. Second.. the takoyaki... adequate amounts of sauce but there was medium sized rubbery chunks of octo in the dumpling.... not minced or diced at all so it was an unpleasant surprise to say the least. Third, the tofu was.... flavorless... even though it was in a cute broth. The broth lacked any flavor and I ended up having to put soy sauce *cringe* on the cubes of tofu... extremely displeased with how this food turned out, everything screams lazy or uninformed about how the items should actually be made. 

Customer service was decent at best. The food came out quickly and the drinks were good. Can't expect too much from a casino restaurant but for the prices they should actually make the menu items as listed and not a sad imitation. Was not worth $30 happy hour prices.

The name you would never know but they do tell you on the menu the Chef same guy. I always been fan of Island Sushi. I been too both locations one on eastern and downtown. One thing diversifies this location is much more upscale feel too it. The sushi bar area is easily biggest one of the three. It has very modern current look too it. Overall never know upscale because the prices are very reasonable most of the items are under $10. There is no real dress code seen braddahs going casual shorts and tank top action. The portion sizes are good size goes along with the local style food. It just opened so you could tell that the wait staff still working out the kinks. Overall say the service was great! Some of the sushi took little longer but still got everything that we order. 

The food I ordered the torq fever sushi roll (spicy tuna roll) the presentation was beautiful. The taste was solid spicy tuna roll. I had the tonkatsu ramen. I know why ordering ramen if not the big three. I was in the mood for ramen. It was another solid dish. The broth was Ono! It was filling with all the toppings. Lucky enough that got too try some of my friends dishes. I tried the gyoza, softshell crab, sashimi platter, and eggplant fries. All tasty stuff. The presentations on all the food was really nice definitely for the price thinking something off. It all on point.

We had a large party of 8 and they didn't seem too busy but the service from start to finish was so bad.  After placing our order it took about 20 minutes for food to begin to arrive.  The California rolls arrived first and D said they were really good. About 5 minutes later a soup and a salad arrived and they were basic. About 10 minutes later everything else arrived.  About 10 minutes later a dinner salad arrived.  

Most had teriyaki, chicken rice bowls that were fine not great.  While we were waiting 20 minutes for the check and discussing how average the food was and how untimely the service was someone from the kitchen brought another dinner salad after we had finished dinner.

777 roll $14

Salmon Skin Salad $8

Spicy Tuna and Crispy Rice $12

Garlic Chicken Bowl $11

Oxtail Curry $17

Creme Brûlée $6

So why i'm I giving this place 3 stars? Well, the salmon in the salad tasted brunt. The bottom of the crispy rice also was burnt. The 777 roll was pretty good. Their garlic chicken was nicely fried and was probably the closet thing to mitsu-ken's garlic chicken in Hawaii.  The oxtail curry was delicious!

My husband took me out to celebrate my birthday at Zenshin on Monday, Memorial Day.  When we got there we had to put our name on a list and were told it was a fifteen minute wait because they were cleaning tables.  Tara took my name and phone number and said it would be 15 minutes, maybe sooner.  So we walked around SouthPoint for a bit to find some lucky machines.  About 15 minutes later when I didn't receive a phone call I walked over to the hostess desk and noticed that she was seating people who had arrived after we did.  So I walked up to the podium to take a look at the list and saw names crossed out below ours.  I asked what was going on and all she said was, ""oh sorry, your table is ready"".  As we were walking toward the table I told her, we requested a booth.  She completely ignored me and put the menus on the table and walked away.  I decided I wasn't going to let her ruin my celebration.  Granted, the food is fantastic and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  While we were having lunch we noticed that a gentleman with a walker was waiting to be seated.  Tara, grabs a menu and walks over to the sushi bar and realized she couldn't seat him there and there wasn't a table ready.  She says to him, wait a few minutes while they get a table ready and just leaves him standing there and walks back to the podium.  Really? Is that how you treat customers?  What appalling treatment.

Happy hour specials are $4.50 beer, $6 wine, $7 cocktails.  $3-$8 food specials.

Came in for afternoon happy hour.  Got off to a bit of a rocky start.  They asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or a table.  We said first available then waited over 20 min for them to sit us at the bar that was vacant the whole time.  Once inside we could see there were several open tables as well.  I understand restaurants need to stagger tables.  20 min seemed a bit much.  Maybe I just needed a drink.  Lol.  You can make reservations for happy hour so I will definitely do that next time.

Everything but the spider roll came out quick.  Sushi tasted great.  I don't usually think of pizza when going to sushi but the chicken teriyaki pizza was really good too.

2604369,2013-03-28,6,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"Really enjoyed my meal here with Anthony and Sarah-Marie. We try to fit a ""sibling"" meal in at least monthly to catch up; trying out the latest spot @ South Point was a great idea. I'm trying desperately here not to hold it up against my favorite neighborhood Sushi-Ya, because it is a fusion/Hawai'i style location. Never having been to Island Sushi put me at a loss as to what to expect. 

Speaking of lost, holy heck, this place might as well be in CA. The car park was INSANE. I was cursing like a sailor on the phone with SM trying to find a spot for 15+ minutes. Do yourself a favor & go to Self Park. 

Normally, I'd be sitting at the sushi bar, but SM & Anthony procured a table in dining room to right. Kind of glad because the sushi bar area was open to Casino and it was packed Friday night. It is brand spanking new, which showed in decor and some service hiccups (they ran out of menus? So our server had to take away the one we wanted to keep: no biggie, but since we order family style, we might have ordered more with a chance to really peruse it as we munched and gabbed)

We had the Eggplant ""fries"" deceptively light for a deep fried item and the batter was airy, like tempura. We also shared the Ahi Poke Tacos (x2 orders) which were very good, with high quality tuna, guacamole and creme fraiche. The Hamachi Sashimi with jalapeño over truffle oil & yuzu was indulgent. We turned at least 4 over zealous bussers away because we wanted to keep that oil for the House Sashimi Sampler and the Salmon Carpaccio. I did not taste the Dynamite Mussels, but I'm picky about mussels. The fish was fresh enough, cut and presented well. It just wasn't that ""flown in last night, killed in front of you"" quality I've become accustomed to. We all really enjoyed the salmon skin salad: on a bed of super fresh micro greens with a light delicious dressing. The only ding was that the slices of salmon skin were very inconsistent in their cuts, with most being on the thin side. 

There were choices for any palate on the menu, so carnivores, ramen lovers, local Ono style and bowl folks alike should walk away satisfied. My Belvedere with a side of soda (I'm super picky and usually mix it myself: former bartender problems) was only $6. You read that right. So clearly, marking up premium vodka is not an issue here! 

In all, this is a great spot to grab ""Asian"" food in this part of town. On a funny note: I was lost and asked SP employee where the new restaurant was and rolled my eyes when she said ""Oh, the Asian place..."" and very kindly pointed me there. Then I walk up and see a giant honking sign proclaiming ""Asian Restaurant"" so I was getting all non politically correct riled up over nada. 3.5 stars rounded up because it shows promise. And ALL of these delicious dishes were just 30$ each+ tip (split 3 ways which is our style) extremely affordable!

As a food lover, I enjoy most foods out there.  Sometimes the food can be good to fantastic, but the service is not the best.  When a mismatch like this happens,  I really have to write about it.  

My friends an I came to the Southpoint Hotel for a Health Convention, we decided that we should come here, since we were here last time and the Chicken Curry Katsu was pretty good.  So we came, had to wait 20 minutes because there were a lot of people.  So we thought wow, must be pretty good like last year.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.

The 6 of us, missing 1 because he was busy winning at the slot machine, looked over the menu and decided we were going to eat light tonight.  Good thing for Happy Hour.  I ordered a Spider Roll and 777 Roll, my friends ordered a Beef Teriyaki, Chicken Katsu Curry and Beef Fried Noodles ""Japanese Style"" w/ Fried Egg.

For me the rolls were excellent in both taste, texture and presentation.  I would give it a 4/5 for the rolls.  My other friend who got her Fried Noodles was not impressed at all.  The fried egg was a sad looking overcooked, extra oily flat ovoid, that was begging to be part of a high school cafeteria unhealthy meal.  This was sitting on top of oily thick egg noodles and thinly sliced beef that was overly marinated with sauce.  To make a long story short she could not stomach it and had to bring it home.  The other 2 friends were way too tired and hungry to care much about the food.

After, finishing, or not wanting to finish the food, we waited for the wait staff to return.  Thinking that it would not take long for the pricing and atmosphere, we were sadly mistaken.  At 20 minutes of wait time, I tried to wave somebody down to get the check, but he said that our waiter will be with us.  After waiting another 10 minutes and my friends asking how come we can't get a waiter,  I decided that I needed to be proactive.  Going to the front, explaining how long we have been waiting, the ladies, said they will look for our waiter.  One came back with the printed check.  The worst part of this communication transaction, was that they did not even apologize have out waiter come to give us the check and apologize for the long wait.  Bad customer service trickles down from the top.  I have been at less attractive meal locations and had the best customer service, to a mediocre meal.

After paying our meal in cash, so we can hit our beds quicker,  we realized something.  They totally forgot the Miso soup that  was suppose to come with the Beef Teriyaki and the Chicken Curry Katsu.  This prompted me to write this review.  I can only say this, like the shadow economy the past year, along with oil,  Service has gone down, way down.  If you are desperate and don't mind to wait and waste your sleep time, by all means this is perfect for you.  If not, invest your time and dining experience elsewhere.  The Customer Service is a 1.5/5.  If you need recommendations for food in Vegas let me know,  I can help.  There is life after bad service.  Take care.",g6DMmDkqhSdWZAacCWpeFg,4,0,2,FM5eInzrxE9aJdOSGYWVAQ

Anyhow, we got our tickets and wanted a place to eat. Because we've never been here before, we decided to try it. And OMG, so glad that we did. The service was great. It was quick and the atmosphere, setting, mood was sooo nice that it really made my boyfriend and I forget that we were in a casino. It just really felt like a restaurant to us. We wanted a table where we could sit next to each other, but we chose the sushi bar instead because we didn't wanna cause the trouble of the hostess moving tables around and stuff for us. We didn't interact too much with the waiter or the sushi chefs, but when we did, they were so kind and totally recommended us to come back for their happy hour. The food was also really good. My boyfriend got the beef teriyaki and I got the chicken stir-fried noodles and it was not what we expected at all. It was more than what we expected. We thought it was just gonna be a mediocre type of place, but the price is totally reasonable for the food. Awesome experience! We will definitely be coming back here.

He helped us pick out some cocktails and came back to find out we were clueless. Poor guy! Lol. Ok so here's the deal I do not like fish at all. Only sea food I like is shrimp and sometimes a little bit of crab. He pointed out the cooked shrimp rolls. Honestly we tried almost all three!! Skip the garlic shrimp there isn't any garlic flavor really. But the crunchy roll and the deep fried California roll are the best. So yummy!!! 

Rory kept coming over to check on us. So nice and we kept ordering something else lol. Next was the chicken katsu meal. Scott had the miso soup that came with it, we shared the salad and then shared the rice and katsu.  Really good!!! Everything we ordered he could eat because there wasn't any corn in it!!! Yay!!!! I had the island drink and he got the plum wine special. He liked them all except for the one with honey. Two managers came to our table to check on us.

Mom and I went on a Monday evening (prior to seeing White Christmas at the Cinemark upstairs.)

We got there around 5:40pm and still had 20 minutes left on the HH menu!  
And what's great is that the HH menu is available in the regular dining area.
SCORE!

So... we had $3 Asahi draft beers, veggie pizza (more like a flatbread that was surprisingly good), potstickers, sweet thai chili chicken and a chicken garlic bowl.
Both chicken dishes were great.  I was surprised.  I figured it was just ... ya know... plain chicken with sauce... nope... both were juicy and had wonderful flavor.
I think we liked the sweet thai chili chicken the best.  It had the whole sweet / hot thing going on.

Service was nice, and the food came out as it was ready... not all at once which really worked for us so that we could nibble here and there.

Since it was Monday... it wasn't crowded. I bet on the weekends it is tho.

I've been here a couple of times now and was disappointed to see that their Eggplant Fries are no longer on the HH menu. It reminded me of Portobello Fries but more tender.  Although there wasn't much flavor to it, the dipping sauce complimented it well. These were probably my favorite on their HH food menu. I've had the Chili Garlic Edamame as well and I really liked the flavor here. It was a good amount of seasoning that really fought out the flavor of the edamame. We also had the Ahi Poke, which was really good, but I felt I could have fresher fish elsewhere. I really like the fact they have a number of sushi rolls on their HH menu, and what now looks like some kind of pizza. I probably will try one of these during my next visit. 

Environment/Ambiance: The restaurant itself is tucked in a small corner of the casino and is a bit small, with booths lining the walls and a large sushi bar in the middle. It's a very open area that's connected to the casino floor. It looks as though they may get a bit busy during their Happy Hour so sometimes there's a bit of a wait.

Service: During my first visit, I don't remember our server being negligent. During our second visit, our server was attentive...at first. But when she noticed that we were just ordering drinks (we had already eaten and were planning on eating later) we saw her less and less. She only checked on us once and that was just to see if we wanted a refill on our drinks. It came to the point where I honestly thought she had forgotten she was our server as she walked by us a number of times without even a glance our way. We were on a time crunch and we couldn't even flag her down to ask for the check.

Tips: They have great deals for the Happy Hour, which is every day from 2pm-6pm, but come early as it can get a bit busy.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,8,6,3,apVk2BhxfFX9MQSH44L7cA

I love sushi and eat it every time I can, but this visit was disgusting.  Even though the poki tacos were tasty, there was little fish on them.  I could have put all the fish on those tacos on a tablespoon.  We have even ordered  asian dishes in the cafe that were prepared in the asian restaurant that were equally as disgusting as this visit.  My son who loves asian food would not eat that dish.  Great service but the food isn't so wonderful.  I will never eat there again.  Save your money, go off-strip and find a better deal and better tasting food elsewhere.",lpMwksiqpt5MURIIJLts9g,0,0,1,IfxuuXO_2OdIAJlD2Nf3EA

Then the scallop had a weird taste. Not a fan.

You know when you step up at 5PM on a Sunday and there is a wait, something great is about to happen.  Hub and I were informed without reservation could be up to 20 minutes.  We took first available seating and got seated only after 10 minutes.  We were attending the Dat Phan comedy show, so we had plenty of time.
Bartender (wish I caught his name) was super prompt.  We ordered 2 Asahi draft beers for 2 dollars....super ice cold.
I ordered the 777 roll for six dollars...it was a big roll!  Hubby ordered the teriyaki sliders.  I think he expected they would be on Bao buns due to some of the reviews on here, but he still liked them quite a bit with a spicy slaw.
We ordered a spicy garlic edamame.  Hub has never had, and after begging him to finally try, I almost had to slap his hands out of it.  He could not get enough.

3583603,2016-09-25,1,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"Zenshin, advertised as an Asian restaurant, is a Japanese sushi bar located in a far corner of the South Point hotel. Upon entry, you're greeted by many enthusiastic hosts, and even the servers passing by will also welcome you. 

The interior is very minimal, which is the popular style in Japan, however, I found that the establishment might have some identity issues. 

As I first mentioned, Zenshin is advertised as Asian, but it's a majority Japanese. Their choice of decoration include the lucky new years cat, Buddha, and metal traditional Chinese garments, which are all things usually seen in a Chinese restaurant. There are a few things Japanese, such as the samurai chest piece, and the choice of wood on the sushi bar, but the vibe I got was more Chinese than Japanese. 

As for the staff, I found that they mainly left their tables to the more experienced staff members, while the younger staff remained at the host stand and the cashier stand. The waiters seemed to have worked there for a long time from their thorough understanding of the menu. I asked one of the host for the name of the roll that I was just given and she was unsure, which left me to believe that maybe everyone who goes into training start off as a host. 

The server that I had was very knowledgeable and when I asked for recommendations, it was very comforting finding out that he didn't point to the most expensive dish on the menu, which is usually the norm of many restaurants. 

I ended up getting the miso soup, gyazo, and the Silverado, all at the recommendations of my server. 

Starting with the miso, it was made with mushrooms, green onions, tofu, and seaweed. The broth was a lot more white than what I usually have and it was made with a lot more filling than most miso soups, but it was absolutely delicious. There was a lot of flavor and the textures really pulled together. The tofu was there but in tiny bits, which I really enjoyed. 

The Silverado came next, which is a bit out of order considering my appetizer didn't come for another 15 minutes. The Silverado is a shrimp tempura unagi roll, covered with spicy crab, salmon, and plated on eel sauce. I have to say..the roll was definitely more sweet than spicy. It did start falling apart a little when I tried to pick it up, but it tasted really delicious. 

The gyazo, which is a Japanese potsticker, came last. It was served with Chinese black vinegar, which I found to be a bit overwhelming mixed with the already flavored pork and vegetable of the gyazo. It wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be because I don't honestly believe they were made fresh, and chances of it being bought in package is more likely. 

All in all, I did enjoy the service and the food, but I do believe they need to put more thought into their identity. Having a majority Japanese menu but a mixed Asian atmosphere doesn't really work.",IvJtGJAUDP1xPhhLJt4g_g,1,0,4,8HqeAeQ0FTd7V06jFSUtYw

All the sushi was better than expected considering where this place is. Also got a bento box and really enjoyed the salad. Everything was super fresh. Service was outstanding! Waiter was very attentive and knew the menu well. Also gave us some info on local shopping options to stock our condo. For the price vs quality this place is great.

We were having our family reunion at South Pointe Hotel.  It's our 7th year.  Last year, a few of us ate at Zenshin and ordered the Oxtail Soup/Oxtail curry.  The oxtail were huge and plentiful.  We decided to tell the others and make a point to going back the following year.

Prior to our visit, I called to tell them we had a large group coming for oxtail soup.  I didn't want them to run out.  Steve, the manager returned my call and thanked me for considering dining with them.

Upon my arrival, I went to the restaurant to meet with Steve.  He was very nice and professional.  He said he was all prepared for our reservations for Sunday, spoke to the chef and staff and assured me they will not run out of Oxtail.
On Sunday, he greeted me and my family, set us up in their private dining room, and introduced us to our waiter for the evening, Rory.  Rory and the rest of the wait staff were very attentive.  The sushi was fresh and yummy.  The Oxtail was fall-off-the-bone delicious. 
Thank you Steve and Rory!  All 15 of us had a fabulous time at your restaurant with our family and no one left hungry.  We will see you again next year!",ktMZ9untLbktZxngIDRtDQ,0,0,5,5Td6dRLGC-s1Qa9Qv7HYJw
3753526,2017-06-08,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"This place was the last stop of the day. Had some grear other grub but had to take the babies out for a little thank you for being so good. This place was conveniently located across from out resort and the fact that it was happy hour was the kicker.

Now, contextually, you'll have to understand that this restaurant is in a casino/resort that hosts alot of rodeos and things of that nature, so, I'm not sure they are going for completely authentic sushi, or sashimi. I'm guess they are going for a wider or broader audience so tje have diluted it, alot. But, I digress.

Obviously, the food was just okay. We ordered a bunch of stuff off the happy hour menu and the lunch menu which lasts until late afternoon. The best items were the pork skewers which were very very chewy, think I'm still chewing it a day later.  The crunchy shrimp roll was really crunchy, I think, due to maybe shells being in there was my guess. The oxtail tostadas were disappointing, didn't taste like oxtails though, and the seasoning was questionable. The waygu burger BG  ordered was killed by the kitchen, totally overcooked. And, it didn't really have much flavor which makes me sad because it's waygu??? The best thing we are I think we're the eggplant fries which were good once we put some salt on them. 

Overall, I would take the kids back here if they wanted to go and it was convenient but other than that, not so much...",tRIHlMbHe4Hsg-ubVLg8Ow,1,0,3,LCah5x5W8li8gx-K3iQ-aw
3754477,2014-09-20,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"I went to this place because I read all the great reviews. I may have gone on a bad night but it was truly awful and I would never go back, nor would I advise anyone else to go. To begin with, the sushi chef lied and tried to pass off something that was not what he said. When I sat down, I asked the chef if he had hamachi toro, or hamachi belly. He told me ""no,"" they did not. Five minutes later he miraculously appears with a hunk of fish and tells me, ""look, I found some hamachi toro!"" Really? Ok, I guess it could happen at 10:00 pm...He prepares it, hands it to me, I eat it...it was eatable, but it WASN'T TORO!! It was regular old hamachi and by old I mean tomorrow it will no longer be good except for deep fry. My son is a sushi chef. I know my toro!! It only went downhill from there. You would only ever expect salmon skin to be used in very small quantities, almost as a condiment. We ordered the ""double down salmon"" roll, believing by the description it was going to be some great salmon with a sprinkling of salmon skin. Wrong! It was a roll full--FULL--of crunchy, salty salmon skin, with two anemic, tasteless pieces of salmon, but mostly unripe avocado slices on top. Disgusting!! AND, we felt the chef KNEW this was distasteful as he and his fellow chefs were joking about the salmon skin as he was making it. Lastly, we ordered the ""sizzling tuna"" sashimi. ""Sizzling"" apparently is accomplished by passing a torch flame over the pieces until they are somewhat grey and lukewarm. I don't know how this place got such rave reviews, but if someone is going by those reviews as I did, you should know it isn't always so great.",w2uN_GwCXQQzkDIX_Eqpeg,0,1,1,1_PjfWozfqxyAc2Ar8CwQw

Food was good. This is Hawaiian-style Japanese. 

Eggplant Fries were the decisive winner. Get these now!  

The calimari tempura was ok. The pork belly was good, but with the sweet and smoky sauce and sour pickle you lose the pork belly goodness. The chicken teriyaki bowl was excellent. Very moist because they used dark meat. The ton katsu was also very moist and crispy. Didn't try the sushi, but looked like they had some worthwhile selections.

The ramen smelled delicious when. He brought it out. However I found the broth to be a bit too salty. There were thick cuts of meat and the ramen noodles were pretty thick too. It was good but not the best. If it was less salty I would have enjoyed it more.

3786127,2014-08-01,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"My husband and I went here one night just to try out a different Japanese/Asian restaurant. 
We were standing by the hostess waiting to be seated for about 15min with no one else in line but us, although we could understand that she was on the phone with another customer who had a lot of questions. Regardless, I wish the manager, who was walking around just asking people how their dinner is, could have given us any of the many tables that were available that night. 
After we were seated, the server took about another 15-20min to get to us and said she thought our order was taken already. She was nice about it though but I still expected a little more than that.
My husband had their beef teriyaki and I had a couple of their sushis. 
His beef teriyaki was extremely disappointing as the beef seemed old and re-heated. It had an ok flavor to it but the quality of the meet was just terrible. 
The two rolls I ordered were just ok and had too much rice packed into it. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Paying more than $70 for a meal that I would have quickly tossed in the trash was painful. 
The one star I'm giving this restaurant is for our server who was kind enough to keep coming back to re-fill our hot tea.

Service was awesome! Our server was very fast, attentive and very kind! The food runners and host were also very friendly. 

I ordered the eggplant parmesan fires which were super good. Perfectly crispy and not greasy and quite addicting! I also got a few sushi rolls which were pretty good and standard for Vegas. 

Sadly my Miso Ramen, was really really bad :/ Being Japanese and a ramen fanatic and having experienced many kinds of ramen in Japan and America, I kinda have an idea of how it should kinda taste. Basically the broth was like they skimmed all the fat and grease from a fryer and put it in my bowl. It had no flavor and no evidence of miso.. The chashu pork was tender and the noodles were cooked perfect, however I could not taste anything due to my grease broth. It was also supposed to come with tamago (egg) which it did not. 

I let our server know of the nasty grease ramen and she quickly took it away and apologized. I had already eaten half the ramen (I was super hungry and didn't want to be rude) but I felt quite sick and ran to the bathroom and puked. I was sick for the next two days... :( 

Though it was not the fault of the serving staff and I don't blame them, I do however blame who ever made the broth and called it ""miso broth."" Certainly not a good representation of how real miso ramen should taste, so hopefully they can raise the bar and learn from a mistake. 

I will maybe try this place again since the service and the other food items were good... but... I really hate puking so we shall see..",ZOXLXDo1C8nlW5a_2RpvKg,0,0,1,SYoTa_0ycZNsutGOZjco4w

4147496,2017-12-16,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"It is difficult to give a full detailed review of Zenshin since all I ordered last night was an appetizer and a beer but I can tell you a story of that much. 

It all started when I won tickets to a screening of Last Jedi from my bank. It happened to be booked for the theatre at the South Point so I came in from work and prepared to get my nerd on. I had some time to kill before the show so I walked around the casino looking for food. The National Finals Rodeo was in town and the South Point was the place to be for all the cowboys. With all those cowboys over running the casino, most every dining option was packed. But not Zenshin. There were pleanty of open tables and no line. Plus they have happy hour specials from 2:00 to 6:00 PM daily and it was now only 5:00. Since I was a party of one, I was seated immediately at the bar. 

I already knew what I wanted to order having looked through the menu outside. I asked for a Sapporo beer ($4.50) and an order of the chicken lettuce wraps ($5.00). My beer was up within a couple of minutes and was simply a nicely poured lager. Refreshing but nothing spectacular. My lettuce wraps came out just a couple of minutes after the beer. There were three pieces of bib lettuce on the plate each with its own small fill of ground chicken and mushrooms. I could smell the mushrooms above all else. Fine by me as a mushroom fanatic. There was also a small bowl of thick sauce which I spooned over the chicken. Each wrap lasted about three bites.  Not huge portions but it was just an appetizer. Despite the small size they had big flavor. A punch of salt from the sauce. Earthiness from the mushrooms. A hint of spice. It was perfect to get me through the movie. 

At $5 for this app, I am not upset. But I would never pay full price for it, whatever full price is. And the beer at $4.50 was high too. Especially for a happy hour pint. Though I guess it was technically an import. All in all, the beer was cold and the food hot. Service was friendly and the cowboys were not (just kidding guys). And everything came to my table fast. 

Historically I don't really come to the South Point more than once a decade so I probably wont be stopping back by Zenshin. If by chance I should I find myself back here, I'd be happy to give it another go.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,1,4,j_U06Lmo-Tdfwty7fbJVXg

The rolls are not rolls, please. They lack quality ingredients and flavor, just .. eh. Extremely high prices, I'm talking $14 or more for a measly excuse of a roll. It's not the strip, guys, and it is no high end Japanese joint. Terrible. We all left very disappointed. Oh, and they don't even bring you those wooden sushi plates or any ginger or wasabe.

and...they..are..SO...SLOW!!!! One sushi chef for the entire place??

Mexican roll - terrible. Not worth $12 an there was nothing inside except old, cold fried crab tempura. Gross. The 777 roll was just OK but it too was not worth $12.

We didn't have to wait too long for the food either. I think the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the ponzu sauce that we got on the side for the albacore. It was too sweet for my taste.

4956422,2017-10-09,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"2 days late but after my experience at tgi Fridays I wanted to post a positive review for a change instead of a rant. First off this restaurant is in a casino so expect a bit of a wait to get seated during dining or late hours. I had the teriyaki steak while my parents had the oxtail soup which is usually their favorite . But while the portion was big the meat was not the usual fall off the bone they are used to , the Teri steak on the other hand was decent but it was the restaurant style where the sauce is separate from the meat itself as a dip, I should have inquired to which way they served it before asking for it to be well done , an error on my part. Also as a side I got a panko style pork belly , 2 small pieces with average taste , IMHO not worth the price. The greeter was friendly as well as the restaurant but due to the average oxtail soup and skewers, it's hard to say it is worth the price charged . Unfortunately there are limited choices within the hotel that serve rice so it is still better than the buffet rice.

Placed a ""to go"" order and wasn't even offered to sit on the bench inside the resturant to wait for our food. Saw it come out and sit at the counter for 7 minutes before walking over and asking for the Mgr. All Keani had to do was offer us a seat inside or at least call us over when the food was ready for pick up but NOPE, instead she let our food sit on the counter and DIDN'T call us over from the slot machines we were sitting at in front of the resturant (we don't gamble) we just sat there looking over and even getting eye contact with the girls at the counter. Mike the Mgr handled it well, offered us a seat INSIDE and had a new order of tempura cooked up.i sure hope Mike changes the way people get treated here. We were dressed pretty casual but no reason to treat us like that. California rolls, spicy salmon rolls and tempura was very tasty and what we expected the quality to be like. 2 Stars for the good food, 1/2 Star (if I could for MIke making it right).

5144993,2013-04-02,2,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"Ok first of all please note I am not a sushi fan so to be fair if I could rate it 2 1/2 stars I would. We went here as a family birthday dinner only one or two of us liked this place, everyone else was trying not to roll their eyes.
 Guess which side I was on?

  First off we wanted to change tables and they made this big deal out of it even though the place was empty. Trying to say the back room as closed so they had to ask the manager, yet there were people back there already. So that annoyed me. And that was only beginning. 

 Not being sushi groupies three of us figured we would just get the teriyaki chicken bowl, sounds easy. Well the waitress was either making pretend We wanted the more expensive dinner version, or I was simply not clear but we got the dinner one which was more money ( also asked for less sauce and got sold up to with cut chicken that isn't teriyaki for a 2.00 upcharge). And the Miso soup was disgusting and no one wanted it. The plates had a small amount of cheap white rice with some seaweed embellishment on it, two very small cold squash like vegetables, a spring mix style salad and the chicken which was dry as hell. My Cousin who doesn't eat much laughed saying we'd be hungry later. ( He's psychic!)

 They got some eel, and sushi or fish platter that was served on a huge mound of ice. there wasn't much there for the money. It looked fresh though.

We also got ribs, they were good, we ordered another lot and the next round were tough. Also got eggplant French fries these are very good but be warned eggplant in general really sucks up the grease so if that makes you wonky don't order em'.
 The drinks looked expensive but I am not an expert on that since I don't drink. My cousin got one mixed drink and it was 12.00.

 The wait staff were pretty pushy, they were friendly and attentive but obviously trying to pad or bring up the bill at any chance they got. ( which made me wonder about the ""miscommunication"" with the teriyaki bowl thing) She suggested dessert so many times I was ready to scream by the end of the meal "" No we don't want any more of your lousy food"". 

 There is a bar, and it looked nice with nice décor and seating.

They do NOT take points, I think you can get comped but they are considered separate from Southpoint and don't take any points on your casino card.

The plates, food presentation, the atmosphere, décor is not bad, This place is trying very hard to be classy or unique so kudos to them on that. I think people who like slick places and drinking and appetizer or sushi eating might love it here. I would not suggest for family dining as the menu is limited and the portions weren't too big. At least have won ton soup for people who don't like miso! In fairness some meals were not overpriced. You can eat here for 10 or less if so inclined to scan the menu for that price range, not everything was expensive. The bill was over 200 for 5 people and we got about 30 bucks worth of food. A few of us did not even order a drink.

 Honestly this place just strunk me as a tourist trap all the way, there were no lines at all when we went and it was dinner time. The Steak burger place next door had a huge line, and I thought to myself you'd think people would get sick of waiting and just try the new Zenshin place but no one was buying into it.

We used to get served a larger bowl that contained all of the oxtail you could handle in one sitting; 5+ decently sized pieces. Now the bowl is smaller and all 4 orders of the oxtail soup we ordered contained 2-3 pieces each. What used to be a meal that had you bursting at the seams, now left you yearning for more and leaving South Point still hungry. The flavor was still great but the value is now gone.

We had to ask if there were a table available for 2 people. The place was decently busy so we didn't mind waiting for something to open up. She said it would be a 20 to 25 minute wait. As soon as she said that 2 people got up and a table opened up. We asked if that table was available and she said ""it will still be a 20 minute wait"" .. I work in the customer service industry and this place tops the cake. I could only assume they had to go to Walmart and pick up new cleaning supplies to wipe down this table. 

The hostess was very cold and not a attentive. Let's just say we ate next door at the burger place and it was just as bad.

What a shame because we really like going to the South Point for the movie theater.",e4caalR3lIjWpHVB-EBkTw,2,1,1,iXjPb6pRhuREMpZwRO6dpQ

A platter of sushi is a choice of California roll or spicy tuna and nigiri.  It was 17.00 not worth it.  Going to sushi mon so much better.   The sukiyaki was decent the beef was tender and sliced thinly so how can it not be tough.  They give you a lot of cabbage a couple of mushrooms and some yam noodles.  Not too sweet like the way I like it but decent.

5406257,2013-06-03,2,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"BOOORING...same ol' sushi places serving up your typical sushi dishes you see everywhere else.  If you're as tired as I am of the usual, THIS is the SPOT to go with their unique an innovative dishes!!  We had a lot to eat here so forgive me for the long review.

SERVICE:
Greeted with a smile and promptly seated to accommodate our group of 6 as promised with our reservation.  The night we went was pretty busy so I would recommend a reservation ahead of time.  Our server explained all the popular dishes like they were being presented in front of a panel of judges on the the FOOD NETWORK.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  On with the food!
 
FOOD:
I had to say at first thought, how great can a sushi restaurant in South Point be, I mean I see SHISHITO PEPPERS everywhere....WOW...these peppers might be the best things on the planet right now.  A perfect appetizer; their menu is much too humble.  The peppers are nice and flavorful from the grill with a miso sauce that melts in your mouth.  I could eat a hundred of these with the most authentic Japanese beer and liquor selection I have ever seen.  The TOKYO BLACK stout was especially complimenting of the meal.  And EGGPLANT FRIES nice and crunchy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. Truly a great texture experience for the palette. 
JALAPENO YELLOWTAIL sashimi; fresh as it was caught the moment we walked  into the restaurant.  Nice sizeable slices of yellowtail with a pleasant ponzu sauce.
OYSTERS on the half shell, I can't remember which ones they were, but we picked the recommended ones by the server.  Once again, I swear these guys have their own ocean in the back.  Very fresh and subtly sweet with great yuzu sauce compliments. 
DOUBLE DOWN SALMON; I do love my salmon and this roll is perfection.  combining fresh salmon with crunchy salmon skin with salmon eggs with the ailoi cuts nicely through the richness. 
The 8 SECOND BULL RIDE is truly a treat for the senses. Harmonizing the ingredients much like a surf and turf into a roll.  The beef is so tender that its like velvet.

DESSERT:
MINI MALASSADAS are addictive!  The only complaint is that they don't give me a box of them!  I suppose its their lure of getting me back into their booth. (which is working).  Next time I'll have to try their in-house made Ramen noodles.",KTf_GRFCIP-NSYih9FPX3Q,3,1,5,RF1M_P0re-XQsBSXM4OvyQ

5533123,2018-03-18,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"First time coming here today from my cousin's recommendation and I was extremely disappointed. My cousins, brother and I were craving some sushi and ramen. My cousins told me this place was really good.

We walked in about 4 in the afternoon. We waited about 5 minutes, not too bad of a wait. As we sat down, our server got us our drinks quickly and was able to take our order immediately. My cousins ordered about 4 or 5 stuff and then my brother and I ordered: miso ramen, teriyaki pizza, crunch roll, takoyaki and a salmon nigiri. 
All of my cousins order came out first and then later my brothers teriyaki pizza came out and then my miso ramen. We were still waiting on the salmon nigiri, takoyaki, and crunch roll. 
After about 10 minutes, my cousin ordered another crunch roll because he thought it would take awhile since our order was. 5 minutes after he ordered, his crunch roll came out. We started getting very impatient, especially due to the fact almost 30 minutes has passed and we didn't get our items from our original order. It was also very aggravating that our waitress never came to see if we got all our food or to see if we were okay.

We flagged down the guy wearing a suit who we assumed is a manager. We told him we haven't gotten our full order so he told us he would go in the back and check it. Few minutes later, he said that the takoyaki and salmon were taking too long because they were doing some ""preparations"" for it and it would take about 10 to 15 minutes. Okay... so in total it would take almost 40 minutes to due prep for takoyaki and salmon nigiri??? If that was the case, why didn't our waitress say that there would be a wait so we can order something else? ALSO what preparation takes 40 minutes for salmon nigiri? Honestly think the guy was making excuses. He didn't even mention an excuse for the roll we were missing. 

Later on, our roll FINALLY came out. And the man we spoke with said that they made the salmon nigiri for me. What happened to the 10 to 15 minute prep???  The guy told us that he didnt charge for the salmon nigiri. I honestly did not care that he did but okay sure I appreciated a little bit. It amused me that our waitress never came back to even apologize to us for the inconvience or even checked to see if we needed anything else or hot tea. When we asked for our checks, she just handed it to us and walked away. No ""sorry for the wait"" or even a ""thank you."" Okay.. What kind of service is this? I was okay after we got some of our food even though it was VERY late. But then even as we are about to leave, our server didn't care for us at all. That triggered me really hard.

This was the most unpleasant experience I've ever had. I wanted a nice lunch before I went to work but ended up in disappointment. I do know the name of our server and the manager, but I would not rather call them out. 

Also, out of everything I ordered, the crunch roll was the best. I give them the 1/2 a star for the crunch roll and 1/2 a star for the guy who somewhat helped us out.",OKIU4flGD2fACF5EsplXeA,0,0,1,EIvrbGI2rzfELOUolkfbqQ

     I've followed Chef CHRIS RECAIDO on Instagram for sometimes now www.Instagram/C_REC, Have dined at his former place SENSEI sushi inside the Marriott Hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii before. I told myself, I will visit him at Zenshin Asian Restaurant at the South Point Hotel in Las Vegas at some point.

    I come to Vegas average 6 times a year, some trip like the CES one last month, I stayed for 8 days, I finally got to visit Chef Chris Ricaido. All I can say is WOW, I'm impressed.

   If you look at their website, no where mentioned his name besides the owner and the executive chef, or their website is so dated, they even misspell the grape varietal. However, be sure to call in advance, to make sure chef Chris is in, you will be in for a real treat.

   Zenshin Asian Restaurant is spacious, you don't have that feel of a cozy Japanese restaurant. It's big and almost feels as you walk into a cafeteria. However, the oval sushi bar, makes it perfect for foodies, you can watch to chef and cooks do all their magic in front of you. Don't the look and feel of Zenshin discourage you. 

   Their HAPPY HOUR is amazing, such a great deal on cocktails and not-so-small-bites:

- Strawberry Bangkok - $6

- Rising Sun - $6

- Beers & wine - $2-$3

- Hamachi Kama - $6 Grilled Yellowtail Collar & Ponzu Sauce, the CHEAPEST in Las Vegas! Order it!

- Teriyaki Beef Sliders or Soft Shell Crab Cake Sliders - $6

- Karaage Chicken - $4.50

    Now the regular menu:

- Jalapeno Yellowtail - Hamachi, Jalapeno, Shiso, Tobiko & Truffle Ponzu - order this!

- Sizzlin' Tuna - Sizzled with Grape Seed Oil, Ginger, Chives & Truffled Soy - delish

- Teriyaki Beef - Marinated in Soy, Ginger, Garlic & Simply Grilled, simply falvorful.

- Uni with caviar, toro, tai, hamachi were all fresh and high quality fish.

- Cucumber roll with tuna, hamachi, salmon was so delicious, fresh, and it was my FAV roll, off-the-menu, but if request on a week day, chef will do it for you.

    I have met many chefs via Instagram and Twitter, Chef Chris Ricaido is 1 of the most genuine chefs, he's humbled, kind, young and very cute too!  And I probably enjoy his company a lot more because he's from Hawaii where my half broski was born and raised, what not to love about him :-)

   Service was very attentive, the price point is so CHEAP compare to everything on the main strip or San Francisco Bay Area. This is why I love to come to Vegas for food. TRUST ME, take a short cab drive to the South Point Hotel to check out Zenshin, it's a perfect sushi spot for a big group or for a family on budget.

5654439,2013-05-28,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this place, but the truth is that good sushi isn't exactly scarce here, so you'll need a few other points of pride if you want to do well.  

We've been twice.  The first time was right after they opened.  We approached the hostess stand to the right (if you're standing in front of the restaurant) and the girl snarled, ""You need to put your names in over there,"" pointing to the other hostess stand to the left (basically just a counter where menus were spread out).  Okay.  Our visit that time was unremarkable - nice waiter, good food, really dead for a place that just opened.

It was the second visit this weekend that solidified my opinion.  Wouldn't ya know, we approached the ""correct"" counter this time and stood there waiting.  And waiting.  And... waiting.  A hostess approached... no, she diverted to the right-hand stand and began counting out her drawer.  After a couple minutes I cleared my throat, she looked up and said, ""Um, are you dining in?""  I said, ""Yes, we were hoping to, but we've been standing here for almost ten minutes.""  Not even the grace for a perfunctory apology, she grabbed two menus and stalked into the restaurant.  I assumed we were meant to follow her, so we did.  Big mistake!

We ordered two apps (garlic edamame and eggplant fries, both good) and three rolls (two of which were very good).  I don't know what to say about the third roll, a baked roll, because it never came.  We waited and waited... our waitress disappeared.  She finally showed up and we asked for the check, which of course, included the missing roll.  We explained that we didn't receive it and asked her to take it off the check.  She was embarrassed, very nice, about it, but explained that ""the first one got burned and they are trying to make you another one.""  Really, 30 minutes after our food came out?  And no one was going to tell us unless we asked?  There were literally three other occupied tables in the restaurant.  The bartender was eating a pretzel.  It's not like it was too busy to handle the Saga of the Burned Roll.

Needless to say we will not be back.",wKwJGB84SaZ0so2TWmhinw,2,1,2,MlM9Ol4Cvundy-VicBfmXA
5667063,2014-12-31,4,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"One would think to give this restaurant one star but I beg to differ especially after what we had to go through yesterday.

Okay we had to wait a minimum of thirty minutes for our table as there was a long line but not compared to the Steak n Shake next door! Next our food did not appear until after 45 minutes of seating. My brother-in-law ordered  sashimi and does that take that long to make? I noticed our neighbors got their food before us even being seated after us. Plus my sister got her soup & salad after her main dish? My sister said her soup & my mother's hot water were cold.

My dish was a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was in a deep bowl that I had to request a fork to really eat it. I enjoyed it even though the HB felt it needed more sauce. My sister's beef teriyaki was flavorful and beef so tender that I had wished I had ordered that instead?! My HB ordered the fried noodles like yakisoba as he is the pasta guy. And that tasted okay to me.

Our cute and most attentive Hawaiian waiter Rory was one of the best servers I have had in a long time. He over compensated by automatically deducting 10% off our bill
(I had a coupon plus checking in on Yelp had it too but he did it w/o me producing it.) Plus he brought us a complimentary dessert after feeling awful of our negative experience. The dessert was very much like the malasadas of Hawaii and they were yummy!!! Underneath each malasadas was some decorative custard cream but edible alongside the chocolate swirl! This was a unique dessert TDF!!!  Okay sweetness can help tremendously but excellent service by Rory (it wasn't his fault but I felt it was the cooks' fault for the delay) really made the difference yesterday.

I would come back to this restaurant on a different trip as we have many other places to try. Don't let my mixed bag experience throw you off!",pjxgZ_tjfP4xibXL3jofPg,4,7,4,T0GMPhZoFN1aYo0HOkv0Vw
5674849,2013-11-27,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"I've really been dreading having to write this review....

I have wanted to dine here for quite awhile, and heard that they have great Happy Hour.  So on a Sunday night, before my bowling league, I decided to stop in for some dinner.

It was pretty busy (around 5pm), but the hostess was able to seat me at the sushi bar.  I was approached immediately by a very nice server and ordered an Asahi Draught (only $2!).  I also mentioned to her that I am not a very experienced sushi eater and she offered suggestions for me.  Although I was more than ready to order some sushi, she kind of led me away from that....

I ended up starting with the chili garlic edamame ($3 I think?).  This was a large portion for one person, so definitely enough to share in the future.

I then ordered the Karaage chicken ($5) and teriyaki beef sliders ($4).  

While I was sitting there, enjoying my beer and Edamame, I saw the hostess following a gentleman who stopped by me at the bar.  I heard her telling him that she could not ask me to move - so he stood there, hovering over me.  It was extremely uncomfortable, and after a few minutes, he asked if I would be willing to move over 1 seat so that the 3 people in his party could sit there (again, awkward).  I know that this isn't the restaurant's fault, but it was weird.  I had food and drinks in front of me and I would just never ask someone to move while they are eating.

In the meantime, it took a long time for my small food order to come out.  I hadn't really noticed, but the waitress came to apologize and said that the kitchen was a bit backed up, trying to catch up on the last hour of HH.  No big deal, it came out a few minutes later.

I'll start with the sliders.  There were 2 in the order.  The meat was very dry, but overall they were tasty, especially for the price.

The karaage chicken was a HUGE disappointment.  I took 1 bite and almost threw up when it tasted (and looked like) it was raw inside.  The outside was very well done and crunchy, so I am not sure how this happened to the inside, but it was not appetizing.

My server seemed very busy and didn't ever come back to check on me.  A Manager came by awhile later to clear some plates next to me, and I told him he could also take mine.  He asked if I didn't enjoy the karaage chicken, but I didn't say anything.  I am not a complainer (although with something that could be a heatlh concern, I probably should have brought it up), and I was in a bit of a rush at this point.  I just told him that it was ""alright,"" and that I was just full.

When the server came around, I asked for my check.  She brought it back a few minutes later and mentioned that they removed the karaage chicken since I didn't like it.  I thought this was AWESOME.  I know that the chicken was only $5, and I didn't complain....but the manager recognized that most of it wasn't touched and removed it without me saying anything.  More restaurants should do this.

I gave my server the check, with my debit card immediately, but after about 10 minutes, she hadn't returned with it.  After awhile she saw me still sitting there and said ""they haven't brought your check back yet?!!"" Apparently someone else was running my card because she was busy, and they walked up right at that minute.  There doesn't seem to be very good communication with the staff - while sitting at the sushi bar, I heard many times that people had been waiting 30 minutes or more for sashimi.  Maybe they were just having a bad night altogether.

I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and 3 stars based off of how proactive the manager was, even without me saying anything.  All of the other reviews seem pretty decent, so it could have just been an off night.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,0,3,lS3xzNJqeFWkdbd_t_6jww

Came here on a friend referral who is a local of Vegas. Remind me to call my friend later. Appears most of the locals come here for the oxtail ramen. Sounds delicious and hearty right? Negative. Oxtail was tough. You had to pierce your fork into the meat and kind of fight with it just to eat instead of it nicely peeling off the bone as it should be. Also tried out some of their HH appetizers, none really worth mentioning. The Hamachi tail was actually cooked well. Location is off the strip, inside South Point Casino. Another negative. Not well ventilated, my eyes were burning from the smoke, my poor lungs were working doubletime. Overall, I don't see myself coming back here.",vhWv4sa7nCVow15gggzcrA,14,16,3,dEl45mR5Odclo9qCuEbMiw

You can't beat that. I had the burger also and let me tell you,  it was one of the best burgers I have had. I think it's soy sauce in the meat. Whatever special delicious sauce they used, It was amazing. I didn't really like the eggplant fries but the dipping sauce that came with them was very good. 

Everyone there was really friendly and to top it all off, you get a 10 percent coupon from yelp when you check in. The sushi was so good we went for lunch one night and came back for dinner a couple of days later. This was one of my favorite restaurants in this hotel. I don't think that you can go wrong here. It wasn't that crowded, which was nice because it allowed me and husband some time have a mini date. I definitely recommend going there if you are at south point hotel.",8QXtRBXVdCBzE9_KsDa2EQ,4,0,5,9ga-rEiLqnHELIabf8wS_g

I think the happy hour hour is 2pm-6pm and I suggested making an online reservation  during happy hour time because it does get kind of busy.",6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,0,0,4,saXU6-oz8TsPyfLF3-sxJA

Crunch roll was sweet and crunchy. 777 roll was a little spicy and chewy, but delicious. Can't go wrong with the prolly roll. Ordered a pina colada and my wife ordered a lemon drop martini.

Food was underwhelming- the baked mussels were too sweet, the black cod had a chocolate sauce which was odd since cod is already pretty sweet, the ahi tacos I liked,  the teriyaki chicken was underwhelming and we asked for more sauce on the side,  and with every entree there was a plethora of rice so much so that when we packed up our left overs I felt we had enough rice for a week.  My wife and kids didnt eat much so I had to get them food afterwards. :(  and japanese food is their favorite!

5894643,2017-12-24,0,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,This place had been a favorite (probably been there 20+ times).  Yesterday the restaurant wasn't busy and our table of 7 waited 20 mins for drinks.  The food order was messed up and the server argued with a friend at the table insisting he ordered a spring roll (he actually ordered the Spider Roll the waitress messed up this order as well).  Two of the sushi rolls arrived after dessert was served.  Usually this is my go to place for sushi but yesterday was exceptionally bad.  The food that we did receive was okay so I will give it another try but the service has to improve.,Jq8VjyoryP8a1WsnwbROdQ,0,0,2,qQSMr8e5mxAYJ09o7xhTow

Philadelphia roll was fresh and flavorful with avocado, salmon and cream cheese. The Crunch roll was a little plain, not crunchy and fell apart when I grabbed it with chopsticks. The lettuce wraps were delicious with little mushrooms mixed in with chicken and savory ponzu sauce. I'll work my way through the menu on my next visit, good first impression overall. Service was excellent. Managers walked by several times to make sure we were satisfied. Our glasses were always full. Plates were tactfully taken when emptied.

5959918,2013-08-04,4,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"I'm basing this review on the happy hour menu. We had a team outing here last night and decided to check this place out. We hadn't initially anticipated doing happy hour, but since we got here before the 6pm cutoff, we decided to order a majority of our meal off the menu. They have plenty of appetizers, drinks and rolls for $5 or less on the menu. We ordered a number of different things to share. I started with a Strawberry Bangkok to drink. It was pretty refreshing, nothing amazing, but good for the price. Here is a rundown of what we ate. 

Hamachi kama - Not the best yellowtail collar I've ever had, but it was a nice size portion and at only $5 I can't complain. 

Shishito peppers - A little oversauced, but the flavor was nice nonetheless. 

Candy cane roll - My favorite of the night. Flavorful and refreshing. I'd definitely order this again, despite it not being on the happy hour menu. 

777 roll - Not a fan, despite the $5 pricetag. The flavors were just off and I probably wouldn't order it again. 

Squid legs - Chewy and overcooked. Really not a fan, wouldn't recommend. 

Salmon poke - This dish was just ok, although there was a little too much sauce and it was a little vinegary. 

Eggplant fries - Second favorite dish of the night. I'm not really a fan of deep-fried food but this was light for fries. The eggplant was really tasty and well-seasoned. Skip the mayonnaise dipping sauce it's served with. It was not good. 

We tried a few desserts as well. No standouts, but mochi is always a safe bet. 

This was a 3 1/2 star experience rounded up for their happy hour value. Most of the food quality was just ok and I don't think I'd be too interested in paying full price for most of the items. Definitely a great value and worth a visit for happy hour. They accommodated our large party quite well and service was good until the end when it was time to order dessert and we couldn't find our waitress for a while.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,7,4,xhcHmV8ChDkI-eb3wd4WnQ

5985335,2013-08-14,1,Er5XAY2UFGGqBHdqpeCFkA,"A gem in South Las Vegas along with Michael's & the M resort. Everything about this place transports you to a different world than the South Point, and That is a good thing.

Our party of eight was whisked away to a huge round table the back where we thought we would get subpar service... That was not the case. The whole night the service was second to none. We started with drinks and right after those arrived our server asked if we would like appetizers.

We started with the classic salted edamame, then garlic chicken, and gyoza. The garlic chicken was fantastic, so much so we ordered an extra one as we were licking our finger & chopstick.  I WANT THAT SAUCE!!!!!  It was sweet & garlicky & mildly firery and so much like a crack substitute I am shocked there are not addicts waiting outside the place.  The gyoza was perfect, crisp yet tender & not slimy inside.  

For our main dishes, we were under time constraints so we opted for entrees meals which included soup & salad.  The miso soup while slightly salty for my taste was perfectly presented otherwise as was the simple salad that had such depth of flavor from the ginger vinaigrette that I could have just had a big bowl of that salad & been happy!

I ordered the tonkatsu which was served in a huge portion, was perfectly fried crisp yet Tender inside. It was served on a bed of shredded cabbage with tomatoes on the side a wedge of lemon which I did not use, and a side of Ponzu sauce.  Others in my party ordered the chicken teriyaki, glazed I a deliciously sweet & sour sauce cooked perfectly to a juicy and tender perfection, chicken katsu, Also tried to crispy tender perfection and one of the teens ordered a beef noodle bowl, full of tender moist noodle sans soup which was served in a bowl almost as big as her head!  There was a few more that I wist I had wrote down but all tasted great (we stared tastes).

Zenshin was a surprise find at the South Point Casino (my guests were staying next door at a timeshere & I was at SP) considering one of the guests wanted to go for Chinese takeout. Instead we found a fantastic place to sit down and enjoy even with the time constraints we had.  It's now a must eat every time we come to Vegas.  It's that good!  Great portion sizes.  Killer Service!!!!  

Garlic chicken on the appetizer menu...GET IT!!!!!
Bring mints!!!!
