I had no wait time and the staff was really cool! 
Hint Hint, perfect place if you have the (munchies) ; ) Or even if you don't. 
This place is far better than Wendy's ,whomever said that must have an affiliation with that franchise as for myself, I will continue to frequent Burger Dogs because simply, it's good.",Qn_M0DGu6DJoSiPDCN2vMw,0,0,5,1meZAWm32gvVGzbwFF4mZw
220084,2012-07-06,0,-n8PaipyFGNUJE4xlnrOAg,"I have been in Las Vegas for 10-years and I now have a place other than Tommy's to get Chili Cheese fries!  $4.89 for a POUND of heart clogging, delicious, layer upon layer of cheese and chili IN the fries, not just dumped on top like some places do.  My fries were DROWNING in chili and cheese and I thought they were great.  Whoever complained about buying plain fries for $2.89?  Well, don't get PLAIN fries if the value isn't there.

I had the Camaro Burger with everything and it was a beautiful, messy, gutbomb with cheese!  It was great.  Ask for the GRILLED onions...  $4.99 and I had no problem with it as it was cooked fresh and was delicious.

For a pleasant change, my food looked like the pictures in the advertising and I was 100% satisfied.

I read the other reviews about the ""horrible"" wait in the drive thru and all I can say is:  Don't use the drive thru.  Go there when you have time.  I admit that the drive thru is probably not going to work out too well for anybody in a hurry.

Everything is made FRESH so it takes TIME.  This is NOT Weinerschnitzel.  Weinerschnitzel is a place I've only been to once and NEVER again.

Burger Dogs is brand new and nobody knows about it yet.  They are still working out their credit card bugs as they are on dial-up for making a payment with a credit card.  Yes, they dial-up and you wait for the call to connect and the payment to be approved.  Be patient and good things will come to those who wait.

Some customers will always complain about how everything should be fast or complain about how they shouldn't have a drive thru if it takes so long to make fast food.  You can't make everybody happy.  I mean, you wait a good ten or fifteen minutes at the Fatburger in Green Valley Ranch but you're really happy when you get your food right?

If you have time?  Then go to Burger Dogs - wait INSIDE - and don't go for PLAIN food.  Go for the FLAVOR and you'll get your money's worth.  If you order a plain dog and plain fries and complain about the price, then why did you leave the house in the first place?",pFULTzUsCad2eJ5gXiogmw,2,0,5,DV-y5GKAA3QklcGDjE3O1Q

342330,2012-05-13,5,-n8PaipyFGNUJE4xlnrOAg,"First review for this place...uh oh. One positive: they have good pickles. First of all, the prices are waaaaay high for what you get and the quality. We pulled up to the drive thru (only 1 car parked outside, dining in) and no one in the drive thru. We were asked to ""hold on a sec"" - after about 3min my husband said ""hello?"" and we were asked to ""hold on a sec"" again...after 5 min we were asked if we were ready to order...ummm, yeah. We order and pulled ahead where the girl at the window stuck her hand out for the money, no hello, no nothin'. She gave us the change and said sorry for the wait, it will be a bit for your food. So we waited, and waited and watched a table of 4 inside wait and wait and then get their food. Then, we watched them eat. Ok...started to get annoying at this point, yes I could see them cooking the burgers on a grill so they are freshly cooked but come on! At last...22 min after pulling up to the menu board, we receive our food, where she once again says ""sorry for the wait"". We drive home (3min away). And unveil....well take a look at the photos I posted. Yikes! My husband's burger Camaro Cheeseburger (2 patties) $5.49 he got with ketchup, mayo, tomato, lettuce was alright, just alright but super sloppy! (You have the option to order mustard, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion & grilled onion, all free). My burger, the Mustang cheese burger $3.99 (single patty) with ketchup, mayo, pickle, & tomato was bleck. Totally overcooked and black. I even got free black ""crunchies"" in wrapped up with my burger - see photo. Totally sloppy! We got a chili dog to share/try instead of fries, cause we thought maybe it will be good and wanted to know in case we come back (which won't be happening) since it was they same price to order plain ole' fries. It was slopped all over the paper, hardly any chili, little squirt of liquid cheese, and what there was of it was all over the paper, again see photo! It was alright, not good, alright. I cannot, I repeat, cannot believe it is $3.29 for this!!!! It is small, the same dog as weinerschnitzel for $.99 Cents!!! Total for our order: $13.80. Price it was worth: $7.50.
 I am sad, I really was hoping for something good here that we would go back to since it is close to us. Oh well. I definitely do not see this places hanging around for long. Sorry to the people who were behind us in the drive thru....hope you aren't still there waiting for your order.",Y-sW-k-vT3jXCfYoOZLt5w,8,5,2,3a2MufnJ2wPBeOzTuk9ubQ

I went there Saturday, there was one car at the window and I was at the order menu. The Gal came on and said ""be right with You"", fine.

We waited for someone to take our order for about five min! Mind you we were the only people. Then after our order I was shocked at how high the prices were. And then getting our food took another 15 min. The food wasn't all that either. My burger sucked. The gf hated hers. Fries were cold. The shakes were good. I'll try it again, but only for the desserts. And next time I hope the service is faster. Not the Burger experience I wanted.

I pulled into the drive-thru and waited 11 minutes before ANYONE even greeted me.  When I was greeted, it was a very rude ""hang on a minute.""  After another 5 minutes, he said ""what do you want?""  I ordered a single patty, fries and a chocolate shake.  I pulled forward and waited 6 minutes before anyone came to the window to greet me.  When he did he said ""crap, we are out of chocolate, all I have is vanilla or strawberry.""  I said ""vanilla is fine."" He went to work.  Another 9 minutes went by and he came to take my money, handed me my food and that was that.  I didn't get an ""I'm so sorry for the wait,"" a ""thank you for your business,"" literally nothing.  

I got home and my burger had cheese (which I did not order) it was also burnt on the edges with little black crusties and rather medium in the middle.  The fries were SOOO greasy.  And the price was extremely high.

2122656,2012-12-01,0,-n8PaipyFGNUJE4xlnrOAg,"I decided to finally give this place a chance today. I am a fan of a good burger and I drive by this place often. It's a Saturday and the place was not busy so I decided to pull in. 

As I approach the speaker I see the menu that surprisingly looks like the in and out selection with the addition of the hot dogs. They theme the food after cars which is cool but I m and in n out fan and I can see where this is going

The gentleman comes over the speaker and says be with you in a minute.  Non problem I say and that's when the wait started

There was one car in front of me at the window and the car was off. I thought for a minute that someone had parked their car and maybe the drive thru was closed.  I finally noticed a guy sitting inside. 

10 minutes later and about two minutes after the guy in front of me got his food and pulled away, the gentlemen comes over the speaker and says go ahead. I order the Camaro burger with cheese, fries and a strawberry shake.  All is good and I pull up to the window. 

25 minutes later I get a guy at the window handing me a bag with my burger and fries and says. That was a vanilla shake right?  I politely tell him it was strawberry and he says ok and disappears again. A couple minutes later he appears by the shake blender with the phone in his ear and proceeds to make the shake. I can see that there is no strawberry in the blender and thought that this was odd. Then he opens it up and pours strawberry syrup in the blender and continues

I ordered the strawberry shake because the sign says ""made the old fashion way"". Maybe it's me but the old fashion way would have fruit and not some artificial flavoring...

After I get my good I remind the guy at the drive thru that I need to pay and he takes my card. He comes back and gives me a receipt to sign that includes a Tip line...  Really? I hand it back and poof he is gone. One problem.  He didn't give me my card back...

After a minute or so he appears and I ask for my card and go on my way.  

Like most of us I reach in the bag and grab some fries for the drive home. As I pull out the cold dark brown objects I am amazed!  That long if a wait and the food is over cooked and cold.  I just sake my head and keep driving. Needless to say the burger was just as bad..

Do not go here unless you really want to throw your money away. I could and should have driven 4 miles down the road to five guys.  Parked my truck.  Gone inside and got my food and then drove home in the time it took to go thru the drive thru and this sorry excuse for a burger joint

Well, 5 Guys is amazing, but I like local joints.  Local family owns this joint.  YUM!  Great beef, burgers are made fresh after you order them, the toppings are tasty and generous.  Fries are hot, crispy and just the perfect amount of salt.  Heinz ketchup for us purists.  The only thing keeping this from a 5-star burger is the bread.  It's YUMMY and toasted as it should be, but it's just too thick.  You have to get at least a double to have any hope of balance.  Triple would be best, but that's too much food for most folks.  Get a single, lose the bottom bun and just roll it and eat it with the top.  :)  I'm REALLY happy to have found this place. The cook was awesome, the food was SO tasty, fresh and hot and it's just like what it should be.  Next time, I'll have a chili dog too.",gtuRablOmw5O08QoKbn0fQ,1,1,4,leCHgVp3Qk4JcEBYUmU1tA

You might miss it passing by because it's on it's own on the side of the street.

I like the car theme with all the car models and pictures all over. They have a drive thru and a small dining area indoors and outdoors. And they were friendly with great service

The food is decent kind of like a Wendy's or a Sonics in quality or maybe less nothing amazing but good enough.  The burgers and dogs are 100% beef and all the toppings are free.  I did the mustang burger (single) with mustard, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, and grilled onions basically all their toppings.  It was satisfying except the bun was cold.

So I pick my girl up from work @ 7:30pm(pay attention to the time) and she wants something to eat(I aint feel like cooking nothing). So I was telling about this place called Burger dogs I seen on my way home from work. We decide to try it out only because I noticed they had reasonable prices. We pull up @ exactly 7:49pm. So were looking @ the menu and all of a sudden, out of nowhere without us even placing our order, some stoner sounded dude says ""Sorry, burger dogs is closed, we close at 8 now"". Me and my girl looked at each other in complete confusing as I backed out of the drive thru and drove away. Horrible service and wont be back to try the food.

Note: As we pulled off, we noticed three dudes inside congregating amongst each other as if the weren't at work. Im still confused.",v63s_QngaH6ywFMNM_YclA,1,0,1,WhjKHFN0kQn3Y3lx-enHlg

Okay, so I moved into the area a few weeks ago and this place is just a stone's throw away so it was just a matter of time till I tried it.

I don't know if I refuse to learn from my own mistakes or maybe I'm just a little thick. I should have listened to my fellow yelpers.

In a nutshell, very overpriced for what you get and service takes FOREVER!

I pull up to the drive thru to order, Nobody was in line in front of me. Nobody appeared to be in the restaurant at all. I ordered a Mustang burger and a regular fries. No drink. This comes to 7.44. Ouch. At least kiss me first. Okay, lets see what this gets me.

I pull forward, pay for items with my card, and wait. and wait. and wait. At about the 8 minute mark I thought somebody might possibly be out back killing the cow. Sheesh.  From the time I got my card back to the time they handed me the bag was 11 minutes. 11 minutes!! 

Granted, the girl did apologize for the wait(which she herself described as ""forever""), but that whole scene was just rediculous. They get the extra star because the burger actually was good. Just not nearly good enough to justify that price or wait. The fries were very generic, like Jack in the Box fries. blah. You do get a heaping mess of them too(for 2.89)

Sorry, I wont be back at all. Just not worth the price or the wait. Not even close.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,3,2,2,J5dWK5L_p2C0ISE4iC15tw
3222139,2012-05-18,1,-n8PaipyFGNUJE4xlnrOAg,"New hotdog place near my house. I don't eat beef, but was hoping they'd have turkey dogs or something, but not dice. All beef. I did go through drive-thru to order fries and iced tea. Fries and drink were a bit pricey for what you get. The fries order was a large serving, so that was okay, but the iced tea for $2 in ""medium"" sized cup was a bit pricey. (For about $1 less in total price, you can Macho Fries & Tea at Del Taco which is more food & tea and the fries are cooked in transfat free oil and less salty.)

To that fact, the fries looked like what you'd get at McD's or similar place, frozen not fresh. Thus, they were nothing special and too salty. 

I had a better experience than April P did in the drive-thru, but for a cute little place that could do something special, instead you get basically the same thing you'd get at most fast-food places. Disappointing. I too was hoping it'd be a cool place to go. Anyone can sell hot dogs and burgers (the little kiosk stand sometimes found outside of Lowes on Eastern has good dogs according to my daughter...).

3704653,2012-06-13,1,-n8PaipyFGNUJE4xlnrOAg,"Well, I went to try the ""Special Burger."" 
Here is how the experience went.

I pull up through the drive-thru and was greeted promptly. I already knew what it was I was going to order because of the pictures from another reviewer so I say, I will have the special burger. She then repeats me. ""The special burger? She asks. I say yes, the special burger. She then states that has 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese. I say, yup? She then asks what else I would like on my burger. While I am staring at a sign that specifically states what comes on the burger. Lettuce, tomato, onion, and special sauce. So I say, lettuce, tomato, onion, and special sauce. Easy enough, but I was a little put off by this. So my order is complete and I pull forward to the window. At the window the woman was very nice and friendly but the way she was talking to me made me feel like I was a little special (slow.) Now, I know that you should be friendly and it is always appreciated but a smile and a thank you goes along way (I don't think that all the awkward conversation was needed..)

Okay, now to the taste.
I knew exactly what I was getting into when I ordered a 4x4 burger with four slices of cheese and it came as expected. The burger was juicy and tasty, the cheese was your standard american and the toppings were there. I wish there had been more special sauce as with all the burger that was there the toppings were kind of lost. I would go back  and maybe get the double or triple. Also, after my order was taken it took about 11 minutes for me to receive my food (with no other visible customers). I don't mind waiting this long for fresh food so this was okay. Just added that in there so that others will know that this isn't your typical fast food.",PVotm5MM-ucxFNTBypb9lA,5,3,3,fVJLlTqlBzePd5HKjaHrjA

The location has been many things in the past and I asked my friend if they had visited the establishment since it looks like it just opened and was right around the corner from his house. He had not and since I like to support local businesses so we decided to try it out. Not knowing anything about it other than the name. I thought it was going to be burgers in the shape of hotdogs, but sadly it wasn't (possible new menu item). They serve hamburgers and hotdogs. It was $3.85 for a singer patty burger without cheese. They have varieties up to four patties for the super hungry and don't charge for their toppings. The toppings are what you would most likely serve at a backyard barbeque spread: mayo, mustard, tomato, onion, lettuce, pickle, and grilled onions. We ordered two burgers with everything but mayo and a side of fries. The burgers are a good hearty size and I bonus points for grilling the bun. It did take a tad long in the drive-up but I feel that is expected since it looks like everything was made to order. The fries were crisp but a little over salted and I wish that they used that extra salt to season the burger but those are my only gripes. I will probably go back and at some time try the shakes that boast they are made from real ice cream.
