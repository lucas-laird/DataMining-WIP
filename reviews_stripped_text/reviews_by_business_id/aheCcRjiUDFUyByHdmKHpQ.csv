They've always been filled to the top, covered with bananas, fruit and granola. Price, $8.95. A perfect lunch after a hike or after a workout. Today was no different, except that my bowl was half the normal amount! I asked what happened to my bowl, literally half the size, (but the same price) and was told that that was the amount it is now. It's been changed. I was so disappointed and can't understand how a business can cut their product in half and keep it the same price. Not good business in my book and I won't be returning. They've lost a customer.

I don't always post the most positive of reviews but this juice bar is really as good as it gets!
I had some time to kill in the neighborhood, so I was so glad I stumbled upon this Oasis (truly an oasis), with its myriad varieties of juices, smoothies and acai bowls...
I got the peanut butter Acai bowel and it was amazing!!! It was so good and filling.  All the products are organic and great for people on clean diets.
I ordered the 16 oz drink so I decided to get the Sublime Juice, which contains lime, orange, Parsley, Kale, spinach, and cucumber.  It was really good!  Has a bit of tartness in it which I like. You can even customize your drinks as well and add on other ingredients to drinks that are already set with certain ingredients.
Friendly and fast service! This juice alone totally satisfied the craving I had been having. In fact, it hardly tasted like juice at all, more like a sweet savory dessert...

The first one I tried was Health Nut which was about $7 or the 16oz. Well worth the cost (especially for superfoods). Really liked the cacao bits in it too. I've heard people say their drinks weren't creamy enough, but I think they need to take into account the ingredients the drinks are made out of (like cashew milk is much lighter than regular dairy milk).

Daniel also suggested to sign up for the Loyalty reward app. By doing so I was able to save $2 off my drink. 
Who doesn't want to save a buck or two. After buying 9 drinks your 10th drink is free!!

My second trip back @1pm Whitney was so nice and helpful as well with another great drink suggestions. Despite it being a lot busier this time Whitney was  patient with me. The way she interacted with all the customers showed that she really cared. Very uncommon to find great customer service no a days. 
Never thought that Beets drink would taste so good !!

My third trip today around 5pm I was greeted by Carmen who was very knowledgeable in questions that I had about their 1 day cleanse that they sell in the store. 
Carmen brought to my attention that on Oct 9th,  their 1 day cleanse was going to go on sale for $20 off. I will be back to buy it this coming Sunday.

Then i asked the girl cashier who was standing there staring at me what her favorite thing was and she said ""i don't know, i guess everything"" Ummmm ok. haha So i asked if any of the Acai bowls could be made without Nuts because I am severely allergic. She said ""No"" and walked away.
I looked at the guy and he just shrugged. So I opted for a Smoothie. I asked him several times to please not put nuts in it for it had called for i believe cashew milk or almond milk and he said they couldn't substitute...

Now with my extensive background and knowledge in the restaurant industry I was pretty taken back by this. I really didn't understand why he couldn't just sub coconut water, soy milk, or even just tap water for the other.

Overall:

Tucked in near the entrance of Macy's in Downtown Summerlin, this cute spot serves up delicious juices that are juiced to order. And with a 16 oz for $5.95, 24 oz for $7.95, and 32 oz for $9.95, no other place can beat the prices. I'm actually really surprised by any negative reviews. I've been here numerous times and I always receive friendly service and yummy juice! 

I've only tried The Greenie and The Sublime because I'm a big fan of green juices and I think they are both really good. The Greenie is a standard green juice, something similar to what you would have in a juice cleanse. The Sublime is much fruitier while still being very green... the citrus makes this juice so good! It's my favorite. The best thing about the juices is that you can customize them! Don't like ginger? No problem. I always like to add ice to my juice and they always oblige nicely (they will put your juice in a bigger cup if you ask for ice).  If you're not feeling like juice, they have a nice assortment of smoothies for the same rates per size as the juices. They also have acai and pitaya bowls ($8.95 - $9.95). If a ginger or tumeric shot is your thing, you can get one of those for $2.75. 

Also, the cleanse is currently an unbelievable $39.95 a day (normally $45)! I don't think anything is organic, which is probably why they can offer such affordable prices. But do your research, organic is not always the best or necessary choice. And one thing is for sure, if you can't afford the organic places, it's better to have non-organic fruits and veggies than it is to not have any at all. 

Oh and one more thing! Their app is sooo convenient! I always place my order about 10-15 minutes before I pick up which is a time saver for me during lunch. You earn ""fruits"" with each order and once you get 10 fruits, you are rewarded with one free menu item :) I'm a huge fan of Nekter and I'll be back time and time again!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,3,0,5,GbzmmpZvGi3wqyJaY-ypPA

4164203,2015-04-10,0,aheCcRjiUDFUyByHdmKHpQ,"I bought a green juice here and when I tried it I was surprised that I didn't like it at all. I tried to drink it and just couldn't. My friend told me to just take it back and so I did.

For some reason the drink tasted very spicy, which was weird because there was no ginger. Later I discovered that there was a good amount of celery in there that made the drink taste spicy.

Normally I'm cool with drinking green juices, but the fact that this had a lot of celery in it made my stomach feel weird and I didn't want to get sick. I will admit there are just certain food and condiments I just can't handle.

I asked the guy at the register if there was any way he could make me something else and he didn't even hesitate and said yes. Wow! That's what I call great customer service!

I paid the extra money for a more expensive drink and gave him a tip for the favor. I liked what I ordered the second time around, which was an almond protein drink that tasted pretty darn good.

I'm definitely impressed by the juice selection and the great service and will be coming back real soon. If you haven't tried Nekter I highly recommend you do so... you won't regret it!

And I'm not impressed at all...
The bathroom was  a wreck (toilet paper everywhere with a dirty Urine incrusted toilet ) and the employees where spaced(as in unwilling to help and very distracted with their own conversation)
The white blond haired cashier charged the person in front of me their items plus mine(without asking if we where together of corse) Thank god she was a friend of mine or it would have apparently been a problem sense she shrugged at both of us as said ""I thought you two where together ?"" And never even offered to refund so I could pay for my drink , instead after almost 20 seconds of awkward stares she said""sorry it's already paid for"" then basically shoved me off to the side by trying to help the next customer instead of dealing with the problem at hand. then she quickly vanished to the back room to talk with her coworker, Which seemed to be more important then the actual customers that have been charged incorrectly. 
When my friends drink was finally done the young african American girl slid the drink down and was very rude/snappy about it when my friend went to go get it. She definitely needs an attitude check. 
(The Only reason I gave it two stars was because the products are actually tasty and well priced) 
Proper Communication (WITH customers) and the ability to Handel a situation that was as simple as refund should be retaught to that cashier sense she obviously didn't do it well this time. 



This is the first negative yelp review I've ever made and hopefully the last !

The watermelon cooler was very flavorful and my mom really enjoyed it. It was also fun to get to watch them juice the watermelon, as the juicer is easily seen from the counter.

After having lunch in the area, I wanted a sweet treat. I also needed to undo the bad taste of a bad acai bowl I had hours prior to coming here. It took me 2 acai bowls to make it happen.

The place has a nice vibe. They have seating inside and outside. I ordered 2 acai bowls which came out quick. The problem I found is that they only come in 1 size (for about $8) which is large for most places and is anywhere from 390-520calories. They have lids in case you can't finish it.

PB Bowl:
Peanut butter, acai, cashew milk, strawberries, banana, hempseed, granola, dates and agave nectar. I added whey protein for a few cents extra. This was recommended by the girl behind the counter since I couldn't figure out which 2 bowls I wanted. Excellent!!! I couldn't stop eating this. The flavors and textures were perfect.

Food: It is always made fresh to order. Only draw back is they should use a better strainer before handing the drink over, two drinks had a considerable amount of pulp. 

Cleanliness: From the outdoor seating, to the indoor  dining area this place is kept like a hospital. Clean clean clean

Overall, I would highly recommend this location.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,4,1,5,MCpNceYjB4D5rQSFQ3G-gg

5844169,2016-11-13,2,aheCcRjiUDFUyByHdmKHpQ,"Located in Downtown Summerlin is Nekter Juice Bar. Limited seating inside, so consider it a take-out juice joint. Vibe seems like Jamba Juice, but elevated because of the cleansing packages and fresh juices. After eating severely unhealthy for a couple of days in Vegas, I needed something lighter and healthier. Since I was in the area, I tried the Greenie and it consists of parsley, spinach, kale, celery, cucumber, lemon, and apple. It's double-strained so the juice was clean, foam-less, and tasty (well kind-of). Yes, it tasted like raw kale, but I knew it wasvgood for me. The apples helped add some sweet flavor.

Service was courteous and prices reasonable. I tried the 24 oz and it was a bit much. Next time I'll try the smaller size.",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,4,5,5,d-S67q3QEZ9OfX5E_q1kzw

Loved the banana berry açaí bowl and the mango delight smoothie. I asked for extra granola in the bowl. It's a little pricey, but the portion size and quality is worth it. Great service and quick. I would definitely come back!",Y29h0G8nwNSMSkYke1nArw,0,0,5,TNUIJcpkUwJxJxa7cvnHDg
