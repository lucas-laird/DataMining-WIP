You can't go wrong with about 30 all you can eat options, from beef, pork, chicken, veggies, seafood items, and even already cooked options/appetizers like gyoza. On top of that, they had exceptional service. Super fast, incredibly friendly, and very informed with several questions we had on items we weren't familiar with. Jessica S. Was one of our servers, forgot the other gentleman's name who also took good care of us.

868363,2017-12-28,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"My first Yelp review ever. Originally went to another yakiniku type restaurant on Spring Mountain but their wait was ridiculously long so was frantically searching in Yelp for somewhere to.eat with my Hangry family. I then looked up Gen on Yelp to see how far the one in Henderson was then remembered seeing a Gen restaurant on Sahara every Sunday as we pass by it after church. I checked on Yelp and low amd behold there were already 7 reviews. I then made a quick phone call to ask how long the wait was. The friendly girl over the phone said at the moment there was no wait so we went ahead and made our way over.

And now my review begins:
-Upon entering we were greeted with such a warm and kind welcoming by a lovely girl and three guys. Before we even walked through the doors we could see the excitement in their attitudes that patrons were coming in. Right before we got seated all of the front of house employees in the restaurant yelled out ""Irashaimase"" pardon my rustiness on my spelling. 
-The second we were seated Anthony was there ready to take our orders and literally within a couple of minutes our food and drinks arrived. As dinner progressed I noticed how attentive and consistent they were. Another thing I noticed is that it got crazy busy. 
-Despite the craziness in the restaurant, every single worker remained enthusiastic and happy to be working there. I believe the owner was there that night waiting on the patrons happily and making sure every single guest was satisfied. The manager even came by to change our grill and wait on us. 
-The food was 10 stars out of 5. It was absolutely and Incredibly yummy. 
-The restaurant was clean and so were the restrooms. I definitely don't see this place end up on dirty dining...and I am a stickler for cleanliness. 

It's so awesome that we don't have to drive a 30 minute drive to the Gen in Henderson. We will definitely be coming back and recommending this location to others.",0LpzYL0oNrsurPokNSnQxA,0,0,5,YcFhZAgici4m3bCg8X2Cjw

Me and my bf been in Gen 3 times and its ALWAYS A GREAT EXPERIENCE for us.

I love the ambiance its spacious and the contemporary and modern design made it look expensive but really its very affordable, the quality of the meat i love how the brisket is thinly cut (personal preference). The taste of the marinated meats is well balance. They also have a bar!! Yay 
Customer service i love it! The smile on their faces it made me feel welcome i dont care if its fake smile or what, they check on us often if we needed anything and everyone seems to be so friendly and approachable i just hope this will never change guys this is my new favorite korean bbq now

The hawaiian style is a marinated meat such as beef, pork or chicken with a pineapple slice. Very tasty. They also now have actual Kalbi with the 3 bones on the side. My favorite is still the super tender beef tongue. 

The quality is good for an AYCE. Service is fast, friendly, and your grill gets changed out regularly.

quality of meat is okay. better than the average kbbq place but not enough for me to say anything. wish the beef tongue would be bigger portions/not sliced so thin. 

service. fine in the beginning and then goes downhill. staff tends to be forgetful. (asked for rice 3 times, salt twice, and gave up trying to refill banchan) also tends to confuse things (asked the green salt, gived me reg salt and sesame oil instead... k.) 

annoying issues. fix up your ventilation. it gets so smoky in there it almost looks like fog during peak times.

The atmosphere was wonderful to walk into and very welcoming. Just a fair warning they do not have a liquor license yet (went Jan 9th) so if you are looking to have some beer with dinner you will need to call before going. 

When you first sit down you have a variety of different samplers that are offered to you. And they take you order right away and it comes out in a matter of minutes! Never had a wait for slow service which was excellent, however they could of checked on me every so often instead of every 2 minutes.

My most recent experience was amazing only because our server Jovanny was outstanding! Although he had 3-4 other large parties to tend to he always came by to our table and made sure we had everything. He's the best server I've ever had not just at this place but in general. He made us feel welcomed and always took care of us despite his manager Linette who didn't make our last visit so good. We would order drinks and she wouldn't let him serve us drinks then proceeded to tell us they were out of a specific drink we ordered but then we were notified that she had lied for no reason in particular. So when Jovanny had served us our requested drink she proceeded to lecture him in front of us even though Jovanny did nothing wrong but serve us. She was merely upset at the fact that she was wrong for lying but used her title as manager over him. If it wasn't for Jovanny's excellent service I would've gave a low rating but he made a bad experience into a great one simply because of his service and personality.

Since it is soft opening, a lot of the servers seem to still be training. They got our order wrong twice and they always seem to be rushing and frazzled.  I understand though, it's a new place and I'm sure they're still trying to get the hang of it all.
The food itself was good. Some of meat was a little dry, but you can't really go wrong with all you can eat for $22. ?

Best thing about this place was the service... however the food was not very good.  Not horrible, but just ok. 
The space is big... lots of cooktop tables.  That also means lots of smoke and grease in the air.  The owners need to turn up the exhaust fans or something.  They need better ventilation pronto.

1409490,2017-12-30,1,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Came here on a Tuesday evening with my parents after i got off work late. I heard about this location a few months ago but for some odd reason, it took them a few months to open. Maybe inspections and renovations stuff? Dunoe ! 

Anyway, this is located on the SW corner of Sahara and Decatur, in the same center as where Circuit City used to be (ahh millennials will not know what this was... XD fyi my definition of millennials is those born after 2000). It took over this standalone building that used to be some buffet (never been...)

Renovations are somewhat similar to the Henderson location but without the high ceilings and more seating (or so it seemed). 

My parents were already seated by the time i arrived and had some food ordered. I arrived and started cooking (sad face i still had to cook after working 11 hrs... zZzZz) 

Customer service for this location was pretty on point (for now...). I got my drink order almost as soon as i sat down and had people asking if i wanted to order more stuff repeatedly pretty often. 

Menu wise, seemed quite similar to the one in Henderson. The only thing i noticed a change to was the amount of beef tongue each order gives, and the ""premium steak"" was a sirloin steak. Iirc it was a NY strip or maybe even a rib eye at the other location but i havent been there in months. Not too much of an issue as i can start cooking on the fat cap, rendering it down then cooking it on the other sides. 

Aside from beef tongue and premium steak, got pork neck/jowl (whatever they call it), brisket, spicy pork, pork belly, bulgolgi.. and a repeat of a few. XD They finally have sliced pickled radish here ! 

The weird thing i noticed was their salad used a ""spring"" salad instead of the usual romaine lettuce. 

The ventilation is pretty bad. The ones without the hood above doesn't to suck as well (....ha...). I've seen the same type ventilate very well to point you saw the smoke curling in but this did not have this affect at all. I feel bad for whoever has to clean those glass walls daily... I actually overheard a someone telling another that they are supposed to turn down the gas if it smokes ....

They are very generous with the portions and keep bringing out more and more meat.  

I had never been here before so it would have been good for them to tell you how the place works. 

The vents above us didn't seem to work well. There was a draft in the restaurant pushing smoke from the table next to us directly to us. 

I wasn't impressed with the variety or quality of the meat. The marinades were too mild and most of the meat to fatty for my likings. 

Very limited non meat options.

The KFC came out ice cold. We had to ask for a second order that was warm. Not room temp cold but refrigerator cold.

By my Korean standards, I would've give the food a 2.5. While you can't really go wrong on meat, it was ok. And then the japchae, soondubu and side dishes... meh. It mimicked the real thing, but tasted nothing like it was really supposed to.

By my normal standards... a 3.5. The portions were pretty small. My friends tried about just everything that was beef and chicken, and I would say to stick with the steak meats if you're looking for real korean bbq but the flavored meats weren't too bad. 

service was amazing though. I loved the attention by the servers and our cups were rarely left empty long.

The meats were great and the Galbi and the spicy pork was the favorite. Food comes out very quickly and they ask to change the grill plate a few times. Sides were pretty standard, but limited in comparison to other AYCE places. There aren't any extra appetizers available or desserts included so that's the main reason for the star loss.

If you come with a party of six or more people, be prepared to wait for 45 minutes. This could have been totally avoided if they sat smaller groups at the respective small booths, but for some reason they don't do that.  It was frustrating to see a couple eating at the ""large seating section"" meant for larger groups.    

No sense of urgency.  This is ironic as this restaurant has a time limit. It takes too long for the wait staff to refill drinks, take more orders, bus tables and generally speaking, tend to customers.  We had to write a list down of ""refill soda, more X, Y, Z, extra spoon, etc"" because the time in between a waiter checking on us was a rare occasion and the list of things needed kept growing.

My first impression of this place, its packed! Came here on a Saturday night, and it was a pretty full house, fragrant with grilled meat that you will definitely leave smelling like your meal.

Love that they have drinks here! Soju galore! The soju capri is a fun choice if you're feeling adventurous. (Not included in AYCE)

They have appetizers like gyoza and jap-chae, veggies, and your typical side dishes.

Hostess failed to greet us, but the rest of the staff was friendly, attentive, gave reccomendations, and solicitated feedback. They were also very fast is bringing out what we ordered within a 5 minute timeframe. So good job there guys! 

Now for the important stuff! The meat! Porkbelly dishes were thick, most of them weee pretty good with acceptable flavor. Except for the wine porkbelly. That was the most bland and dry/chewy piece of porkbelly I have ever eaten, also the purple color was a little off putting.
Briskets and beef tongue were cut thin. We ordered a steak, or something along those lines, and it was huge! You definitely get some quality meat here, and they don't skimp at all.

They have seafood here as well! The squid/calamari was so tender and tasty! The octopus wasn't bad either, but it did look scary at first uncooked haha. Shrimp were not marinated, but a good option to start out your meal with(you peel off the shell yourself).

They have ice cream macarons here (not included in AYCE, so 3.50 each). Totally worth it if you love sweets! They have strawberry, green tea, coffee, and mango flavor.

The only thing I have to say is that I was incredibly thirsty after the meal. I'm usually a very hydrated person, but I was so parched and guzzling down water hours later. So that might be an indication of what they use to marinate thier meat/seafood with.

Overall good! I'll be back!",AAUPbv9rhQs8LDeqGgWVCQ,1,1,4,e9Y1F4s2cuMh26YCy97T4g

The upper management helped out and I was shocked that they would be helping out.. 

All the meats was good and fresh. Came out fresh and fast. I can't complain of all the meats and veggies. Just wished they had a dessert option but never fear I went to Dairy Queen lol.

Waited about 5 min and we were seated. The best part about this place are the servers and the quality of their meat. Our server was Austin, he gave great recommendations, provided quick service, and was very attentive. Our cups were never empty. Not only him, but all the other servers who came by to check on us and drop off food. It was a nice change because usually at ayce places, they tend to forget about you after the third order. Also, the way they season their protein here is very good, very distinct and different flavors rather than everything tasting like sesame oil. Although this place is great, I had to subtract a star for two reasons. One, our table did not have a vent fan above it (some tables do, but our particular section did not). Two, the only dessert they have here is ice cream macaron and it's additional cost at $3.95 I believe, and they are tiny!",bxRQIGQNkvxrmZ1i_cAnKQ,1,1,4,r7gvOXz6_8PMkqgAiRn4Ag

However, as far as being seated and the manager's demeanor involved, it was just unacceptable.
When we entered the restaurant, we were told that the wait was 10 minutes. After about eight minutes, we were told that our wait would be 30 minutes or less. There were six of us and we opted to stay. It wasn't as bad coz we were seated at about 20 minutes later. Orders were taken and beverages were served. one of the foid runners accidentally nudged the glass of water of my wife and doused her sweater and pants. The food runner was very apologetic. He even called the manager who just wiped the table and the floor but did not acknowledge that my wife got drenched with about 16 oz water. 
My wife and I left the restaurant earlier than our kids coz she was getting cold coz of her drenched sweater and pants. We paid our bill and left a generous gratuity for our server. We expected more from the manager though.

1993545,2018-02-09,10,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"KBBQ is not one of the foods I crave. However, I have tons of friends who do, so eventually I get dragged out to most of the major places in town. Gen's new west side location finally warranted a visit, as the new location eliminates the hassle of hiking out to Henderson.

I love this building and have watched it go through three other restaurants over the past few years. Gen feels like the best fit so far, and the clubby lighting isn't as off putting as I normally find it. Space is large, several seating options, plenty of larger tables for groups, $22/pp is more than reasonable for what you'll get here.

The menu is pretty huge, as are the portions. Come with a group or after a day of fasting for the biggest bang for your buck. The banchan were plentiful not quite as great as my favorite spot, but the meat is definitely swoon-worthy: platters of pork belly in several different styles (red-wine marinated being my fave), beautiful towers of rolled brisket, and my personal favorite, the garlic calamari. I haven't even had all they offer across a couple of visits, there are so many choices. Save room for macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert. I'd rather allocate space for that than drinking, but they have a huge bar menu too if you're into that sort of thing.

Shout to the super attentive staff who are on top of drink refills, always asking what they can bring you next, change out the grill before I even think it's needed, and just generally have a good attitude, no matter who I've had so far.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,18,4,2UqQZ2lAAmfZXCHjWb50JA

This was unfortunately my last meal while in Vegas, and I'm really disappointed I ended my trip at Gen.

Also, the atmosphere of  of the restaurant is great.   Very modern, clean, and comfortable.  For the AYCE dinner, it's $21.99 a person.  And I believe there is 39 options of raw meats (some marinated and others not) and already cooked appetizers.   The selection for the most part is very good.  I was wishing they had skirt steak but they have lots of other choices.  They have a few varieties of pork belly, chicken, cuts of beef as well as calamari and shrimp.    I've been to a few different Korean BBQ AYCE places and don't usually see the seafood selection this place had.  

The only big knock on Gen was the quality of meats.   Most of the items we tried were chewy and not the quality levels I'm used to at a Korean BBQ place.   And we weren't a fan of most of the marinades when the meat was pre-marinated.   

My favorite item was the KFC.   Also thought the spare ribs were pretty good.   

Considering most of the people there are grilling their food, the ventilation seemed quality because it wasn't very smokey at all.   

Servers are very attentive, helpful, and nice.   Restaurant is really well done and on a Saturday at 7PM, we only waited like 3 minutes to sit.

It takes approximately 10 days without water for the average human to die of dehydration, which was clearly taken into account by this establishment as the all-you-can-eat-but-not-drink time limit was set to 2 hours. I must commend them for their forward thinking. It got so bad that at one point, myself and 8 other patrons were forced to participate in an in-house spelling bee contest in order to gain access to the coveted cup of water. We were asked to spell ""rondayvoo,"" which apparently is not the correct was to spell rondayvoo. To the surprise of nobody, their thirst for literary excellence was not quenched. 

There is much more to say, but I am writing this review with what is left of my withering energy. I can feel my senses numbing. I struggled to decide whether or not to contact my loved ones for the last time, or warn all future customers of Gen Korean BBQ House. My decision is obvious.

I farewell thee, and hope for a equally brighter, more hydrated future for our children.
With that, I tip my glass (and a mandatory 18% gratuity) to the readers of this review, a final sip for us all, because that is all you are going to get.",NQqkAoMTOL6TuLxriP4gdw,4,3,2,GbnWcrqkZsnglZKqOtYa4g

But first huge disappointment was a terrible ventilation system. Unlike the henderson location it was """"really smoky,,"""" secondly maybe because its a fairly new place, the service wasn't that great, my waiter forgot to bring few items from the first order, we ordered soju but he forgot to bring shot glasses(??) then we asked someone else for the shot glasses after a quite long wait, then he brought us tall beer glasses :-((
My favorite appetizers at Henderson location wasn't on the menu anymore (Crispy spicy Rice cake, Fried Squid legs) Very good quality of beef tongue, ok pork belly, ok galbi, very good K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken)..No doubt it's a still decent dining spot for the price but we are not sure if we ever go back again because of their bad ventilation system and they don't offer my favorite appetizers anymore.",fzs8Urw86gD988D9xdmQ3g,0,0,3,IV1r9VU4DdWTUnpu-4EwTA

I stop going to the one in Henderson cuz #10 galbi is label on the menu but it's NOT galbi, its chewy and w tendon beef which they claim it's galbi(I know my meat) .

When I saw on Yelp that the new location have it cuz they just open and was excited to try it, BUT was disappointed  in the quality of the meat, omg it lack flavors and was sooo chewy..  I love marinated meats and all their meat lack in flavors..

2934885,2018-02-10,4,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"I mean...they're still only charging $22 for dinner and they'll seat my fata$$ solo (meaning they seat parties of one). 

My personal pro-tip. If you want a side of fried chicken or japchae have at least three other people to split it with. They say the portions are small but the portions are too big for ppl who want to use their most of their stomach space for grilled meats and seafood. 

Another (possibly obvious tip) stagger your marinated and unmarinated meat because the only thing they have to grease up the grill is unmarinated meat. They're very liberal and quick with the grill changes but if you go unmarinated then marinated, you won't have to ask as much. 

I like spice and calamari so I recommend the cajun calamari as something different to try here that you probably won't find or try other places. I don't recommend it if you don't like calamari. I don't think it'll convert you but If you do it's tasty. 

The quality of the meat is good for the price. It's the best I've had among ayce places and they don't overdo it with the marinade on the marinated meats. 

I was in the mood for soondubu. I'm not an expert or aficionado. I just like it. But while I liked mine as an owner, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to the discerning or the newbies. This is tofu soup for someone's who's thinking, ""yeah, tofu soup from an ayce kbbq place seems like a good idea tonight, and goodness that's a long sentence, and why am I still talking to myself?"" 

Lastly, I guess I went during the grand opening. I can understand you want a lively atmosphere, but I don't need the bass booming during my meal. I don't know who does. ""Time to eat, let's turn up the music!"" said no one ever, ""I want to have to nurse a headache after my meeeeaaal!!!"" 

Now, after all that. You might be baffled by the five stars. But the service was good, the food was good, the price was good. And after complaining four times (two before being seated, and twice after being seated [they asked]) the music got low enough that I didn't try to run to Walgreens and get ear plugs.

2935161,2018-06-22,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Absolutely Favorite Korean bbq place to go here in Las Vegas and California. But this location especially, they have absolutely great customer service. George was our serve but a few other servers helped us out as well Kaithlyn I believe was one. They all work together and I love that cause it helps give you the best experience. 

The food here is always delicious. From the salad to all the appetizers and the meats. Our favorites are the chadol (beef belly), the beef brisket and beef bulgogi. We always get extra brisket sauce and salad dressing sauce to dip our meats and gyozas in. 

We often come during lunch because it's such a great deal. It's only $16.99 for all you can eat which is awesome, we get around 8 plates of meat for the both of us usually and come out more than satisfied. 

I'm so glad they built this location, it's a lot closer to us and local to anyone that comes to the strip. We live up north and it's so much nicer to drive only like 30 minutes vs an hour to the Henderson location.",VDsnV9Xc-akVbJC0hVtAQw,0,0,5,oYIWWBI-_MYPsvE-hDQCyg

We came during happy hour and he said we would be charged the happy hour price for drinks.  Unfortunately he left without any notice and it was hard to get service after our initial order.  When we finally waved down somebody they were a little rude and acted like we were an inconvenience for trying to order more food.  We ordered more drinks about fifty minutes before happy hour ended as well.  When we got the check only our first two drinks had the happy hour price.  I would have gladly given this place five stars had we had our first waiter the whole time.  Our waitress just seemed unconcerned and stingy after he left.

We asked to be moved and felt like we were being punished. They seated us by the kitchen door and we were lucky if anyone came to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. We had dishes on the table that needed to be taken away and sat at the edge of the table table for 15 minutes before I was finally able to flag someone down.

3216210,2018-04-24,1,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Pro Tip: Bring a change of clothes if you're planning on going out after eating.

I've now been to Gen 3 times.  I was reluctant to go that second time, because I did not have a good experience the first time around.  To my surprise, the menu had changed and the meat selection was definitely an upgrade.  And the best part is dinner is only $22!!!!!  You won't find another AYCE KBBQ place that serves kalbi for anywhere near $22!!!  

Here my list of Gen's Greatest Hits:

Gen premium steak - oh so tender and juicy, might be my favorite item.
kalbi - well marinated, tender, and very tasty.

cajun shrimp - i'm not sure what the cajun seasoning blend is, but i do 
know it is delicious

spicy baby octopus - smothered in kochujang sauce, these ocotop.odes were scrumptious and not too spicy.  i highly recommend this item.

bulgogi - sliced thicker than what I prefer, the meat was a tough and put on my never order again list.

chadol - thinly sliced brisket that melts in your mouth. a must have item.

KFC - korean fried chicken was a bit disappointing.  tasted more like orange chicken from panda express than KFC from other korean joints.

japchae - this one is ok.  A bit on the sweeter side for my taste, but a descent appetizer choice.

gyoza - i admit, i love me some friend dumplings.  Especially when waiting on meats to cook, it is nice to have a cooked item to munch on.

soondoboo - thoroughly disappointed in this dish.  The broth was ok, pretty tasty actually, but they used the wrong tofu!!!!  You don't put firm tofu in soondoboo!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone knows that!!  You use the soft, silken tofu!!  Duh.

If the soondoboo and kfc were better, I'd give this place 5 stars.  As it stands, I can only do 4.  Also, I don't waste my time with pork or chicken.  I only go for beef and seafood.  For the price, service, atmosphere, and quality of food, Gen is no doubt my #1 choice for AYCE KBBQ place in Vegas.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,2,4,4,wo2w1kFWzNCgSn3PmrkLPw
3250838,2018-04-10,3,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"4.5 stars

The KBBQ here is solid all-around, and they offer a lot of choices of meat. Banchan (side-dish) is decent, not the greatest. I really like their salad dressing tho. 

My fav items include the marinated short ribs, premium top sirloin steak, brisket, cajun calamari, cajun shrimp, and premium pork belly. 

Clubby atmosphere. It's loud and dark with electro music playing in the background. A downside for me personally to this place is that it doesn't have the authentic feel of a Korean bbq joint. I didn't see any Korean workers, and you have to ask for a lot of the little things like sesame oil, samjang, garlic, etc. 

In the end, $22 for all the variety of meats makes this place worth it.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,8,5,5,rA3jppNH5wXuzP80TD7NFg

They do apply a 18% gratuity for a party of that size, which was no problem but that means the server can lack service and they will still get almost a 20% tip.

My family, who eat meat, seemed to enjoy it but vegetables and noodles did not fill me up. I was hoping they had tofu, but nope. If I was a meat-eater, this place would have been better, very cool idea. Also, ventilation of this restaurant was bad, left the restaurant REEKING of bbq smoke.

In short This is a fantastic Korean bbq restaurant!  The ambiance was very lounge like with blue neon lights reflecting off of mosaic mirrored vases. The standard  Korean bbq set up with the round grill in the center of the table where you prepare your own foods was surrounded by salts sauces Kim chi, & ginger and was presented on lovely simple white saucers and plates. The menu was AYCE top quality beef, seafood, chicken and pork. The bulgogi  was so good we ate four servings of it! Not to say the servings were small they were adequate and replaced almost immediately with more by quick service! We also tried or shall I say devoured, shrimp, premium pork belly, garlic pork belly, KFC (Korean fried chicken which is prepared in the kitchen) calamari, beef brisket, Hawaiian beef steak, & gyoza. Last but certainly not least is service! All that food  was served quickly with a smile by Justin and assists.

The japchae was another level of deliciousness. 

Service- hostesses and waiters were on top of their game. They constantly checked if we needed more meat. The best part was how every plate was equally fresh and delicious as the first. Other gens give you lower quality meat as you eat more but this one maintains quality.

3674047,2018-05-06,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"I came here last night with some friends and had a good evening but wasn't blown away by the culinary experience. The best thing about Gen in my opinion is the service. I received my drink order and our first round of meats in literally less than a minute. We almost became overwhelmed with the amount of food piling up on our table. I do also like the interior here, and it's very spacious and modern chic. 

As we cooked the meats over the stovetop grill, I felt that the meat was sticking to the grill much more than it should and it continued this way the whole night. Our grill actually became covered with charcoal and became unusable pretty quickly. However, the service helped us change out the stovetops promptly. 

The complimentary appetizers were very standard, but I did personally like the salad. The best meat i had of the night was the premium steak and the pork belly since both of these were tender and flavorful. I really also enjoyed the tofu soup since it added some tanginess to break up the heavy savory dishes. 

I did not enjoy the galbi one bit since it just tasted like sweet ambiguous meat. Most of the pieces I had were hard to chew through and very fatty. I couldn't even dip the meat in the dipping sauce to add some depth of flavor since the dipping sauce here consists of sesame oil and salt. The beef tongue was better, but it still lacked the succulent high grade quality of meat that I enjoy. 

I understand that you get what you pay for. You can't expect the highest quality meat with a very affordable AYCE price. I am impressed at the large selection of meats and dishes and again I am very pleased with the great service we received here. I would come back here with a large group or for a big celebration, but I wouldn't come if i'm looking for an intimate date setting or gourmet meats.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,2,2,4,SPBQgI6TQE1WfgNhoqH9EA

Gen Service:  Great great service to get our party of 10 seated within 10 minutes on a Friday evening.  Our meats were brought to us quickly upon ordering and banchan replenishes were quick as well.  Our lead server was great with changing the grill and keeping everyone's drinks fresh.  All the staff in general had a upbeat and positive attitude, fantastic.

Gen BBQ: Everything we ordered was above average but the premium steak, bulgogi and pork stood out for so these received repeat orders.  The salad was really fresh and paired well with our meats.  The usual banchan side dishes were good but the servings were tiny.  I especially enjoyed their Jap chae noodles.  Ask your server create the Gen Dipping Sauce as it doesn't automatically come with your orders.  This is a delicious in house dipping sauce that I will request at future visits.

Gen Ambiance:  A large dining area smartly designed with multiple tables, booths to accommodate large crowds that are popular with ayce Korean BBQ.  The open room restaurant dimly lit with some great Tron blue accent lighting but you're eating area is well lit for dining.  At an initial glance, you could mistake this place as a high end cocktail lounge.

So buyer remorse just hit reality, it's the same feeling you get after you buy a car.

Tons of rolled brisket is always a hit at my house.

Hawaiian steak was the winner as the kids kept fighting over the one slice of pineapple.  So we had to order two more Hawaiian steak to make everyone happy.

Gen Signature Galbi for this price NICE!

Must order the onions and mushrooms, garlic, jalepenoes, and bean paste.

They were waiting to get their liquor license for their bar. We will return once that happens. The service was great! Favorites: Cajun shrimp, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), chicken with fondue jalapeño dip, thumbs up that had the ribs and #1, the mushrooms and I liked the green tea salt. Not sure if Korean BBQ places do fish, but I felt that's all that would've been a nice choice. Great place for groups or a date. BTW, they have a couple of TVs at the bar if your special someone wanted to catch up on sports.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,0,0,4,End8YFZg0LUT8V7mXR3lGA

4699903,2018-04-21,8,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Friendly, clean, and not too smoky spot for Korean BBQ. Our server Austin was on point and made sure we were taken care of. He suggested some good soju and meats to start the evening.

We started with the odds and ends first. Intestines and tongue were good, but needed quite a bit of cooking time. The volcano chicken was not as spicy as I thought it would be, but was one of my favorites. The ribs were a definite hit too. Andrew the bartender made a tasty and pretty soju mojito. Banchans (side dishes) were refilled frequently which was nice. Dinner service got busier later in the evening causing a slight delay in our table getting the meats we ordered, so some of the table mates were a little hungry in between orders. 

Lastly, for large groups, you can only split the check 3 ways. They can take 2 different credit cards and the third payment would be cash for the remainder of the balance. Which made math time extra fun after we had a round of drinks, but we figured it eventually. Overall, decent bbq, good service, and cool atmosphere.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,21,16,4,nMmoQEm1Nl9bGJ0dh0qKYw

The service was incredible and the food was really good. Hopefully they can keep it up because it seemed like the service at the Henderson location could be hit or miss.

It's been a few months since we went to the Henderson location but there seemed to be a few differences between this location and the last time we went to the Henderson one. This Gen had two kinds of salt vs. just the green tea salt at Henderson. The galbi at this location also came bone-in whereas the galbi at Henderson was boneless. This location is less busy for now, but I'm sure it'll fill up as word gets out.

One negative about this location is that the ventilation isn't as good as the Henderson location, at least at our table. Other than that though, for sure a great experience overall and we're very happy to see Gen come to this part of town.",89MRppNHY1wtoI0V7vqdSA,1,0,5,unYKFOuNCrbWPuH4lqmcyQ

4738669,2018-02-11,1,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Introduction:
So while we were on our way to Cheesecake Factory, we saw this amazing Korean BBQ Gen.  Therefore, we decided to stop here instead of Cheesecake Factory. So excited that they put one here, WHOO HOO!

Customer Service: 5/5
So there's quite a few Gens in CA, their service is not quite as good in comparison to this one.  Which we stopped going. Everyone was on point at this location and our orders were served quite fast.  I hope they don't lose this awesome service when they get busier in the future.  That tends to happen after a business gets picked up, they lose their  loyalty to their customers that once bring them revenue to stay in business.

Price: 5/5
Omg! Finally a REAL Korean BBQ that belongs here. The Menu is outstanding with such an amazing price.  Most importantly, it's simple, in both pricings and categories.  I have a hard time locating a Korean BBQ restaurant here in Vegas that is buffet. And when they are, the meats are not AYCE or the Menu is annoyingly complicated.  With this pricing, you can only order this and/or that or, it's not a buffet. WTF? Super annoying well not at Gen, simple to the Max. 

Atmosphere: 5/5
Gorgeous, cozy and Modern! I love the fact that the grill is kinda deep, therefore, you avoid the splashing. In addition, the ventilation is exceptional. I usually have to change after lunch from the one in CA. I did not have to do that here. 

Quality: 5/5
One word OUTSTANDING! Everything was so freakin amazing, even the pre cooked items. I can not say that there's one item in the Menu I do not care for.  Everything we ordered were YUMMY!

Quantity: 5/5
A LOT, so much I could not walk afterwards.  They don't serve you those tiny little annoying small steam rice bowls that I always had to order two. Here, one is enough.  Every portion was super generous.  

Tips to the Owner:
Please ensure your TEAM don't lose their momentum, in both service and their attentiveness.  Right now, they are AMAZING, I will always be back and give you guys referrals if it stays like this.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,1,1,5,Up_sCInCVITUNJZsiAvcaQ

Wait staff are knowledgeable and always there to help. Kimchi and other side dishes were fine too, although I prefer kimchi quite a bit hotter. I like the ""Gen"" name and meaning and Chinese character.  
What is missing is obviously good OB Korean draft beer- they should also serve Asahi, Kirin and/or Sapporo. They should also give us a disposable plastic apron to shield our fashionable attire from the splatter.",LerhVER3hrPDXGBSbMMZAA,0,0,4,AT_dtIV8yWyb4l0PQWkAOA

The waiters themselves were very attentive and the food came out very quick. But the quality and marination of the food didn't taste that great. They didn't have a lot of the menu options that general Korean BBQ restaurants offer but at the same time they had a variety of other items on their menu for lunch that are not available at other Korean bbq restaurants. If you're looking for a spot that just gets that Korean barbecue craving out of your system then by all means, but overall this place would not be my number one spot to go to While in Vegas",pizFx1x3snKRFZ2_b2ozNw,0,0,3,-KLE9-BEhmAYV2y2hvqJ1A

Great atmosphere. Dim setting with cool blue neon lights. Plenty of decent size flat screen television for entertainment.

Once seated you have your appetizers all set up so you could dig right in!

Menu is pretty simple to read with over 30 choices items to cook on your grill. Ranging from steaks, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp and calamari!

Service wAs great, our food arrived promptly to put on the grill, drinks always kept full, and the grill plate swapped out twice to make sure we could cook up our proteins! My favorite protein was the bulgogi, we ordered 3-4 plates of this. Pork belly was good, maybe could have been sliced a little thinner as it took awhile to cook and if not cooked through, it is chewy. The only thing we didn't care for was the shrimp and squid, the shrimp were fine just a bit fishy ( it is seafood tho) and re squid was way too chewy.  For dessert we each had a macaron (mango and strawberry). We love these.  I definitely recommend this place, makes me want to explore similar concepts where I'm from.",80F0UXmJgsAns-jjSkAUjg,0,0,4,ka-tXpdMfcKvGDOrZYMO3g
4843274,2018-03-23,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"I've always been a huge fan of Gen in Henderson.  The service is always excellent and fast, which if you've read my review of the Gen in Henderson, you'll know that's almost unheard of in any Korean restaurants.  This Gen on Sahara meets all my expectations and I am super happy that there's now not only one close to my house but one close to my office!

The meat is always decent, some much better than the others.  For example, the beef tongue.  No one I've introduced beef tongue to at Gen has ever disliked them.  

The price is more than reasonable. Actually, it makes you wonder what kind of margin they are running at because it's just so much bang for your buck!  

I don't see why I should try other Korean BBQ anymore because Gen has everything I want and need.  I highly recommend any locations of Gen.",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,1,1,5,POpoC4KhoGjMMcPl8mvOBw
4845381,2018-02-03,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"This place was pretty good. The service is excellent and they were very accommodating.

We were here before the lunch rush, like right after they opened, and there were six of us. They sat us at one of their big booths that only had one grill. It was hard as heck first because there was six of us and waiting for food was no bueno. It would have been nicer if they sat us at their other tables that had two grills.

We requested to have us move and instead of moving us to the two grill table they split us into 2 groups of 3. I  suppose that was better than one grill.

Each time we ordered meat, we ordered some Gyoza. And they were bomb as fuck!! So while waiting for the meat to cook, we were eating something. And I love gyoza and their gyoza was bomb. 

They didn't have egg which was kind of lame.

They don't do half orders of meat which was odd. It was hard because after awhile you don't know if you're going to finish the meat and they charge you for not finishing so not being able to go half order was hard. 

The meat tasted pretty good there, they also had seafood which I'm not a fan of but my group was so they seemed to enjoy it.

I rate this place a 4 because they have great service, the food was great and the ambiance was nice. I would have given this place a 5 but they didn't have egg and they don't do half orders.",VU8kKjsrYL35vRygkIMhyg,1,1,4,MwyjPowcJq3kYc6oIQZg5Q

Now before I get into my review...i need to let u know when my birthday is...yes...its on Valentine's Day!! 

So normally I have to book one yr in advance at my favorite restaurants due to the fact that it's my birthday and Valentine's Day and normally it's hard to get a reservation...

But here I am one day prior to deciding to come check out this restaurant. I called at exactly 11 a.m and. a young lady answered the phone and politely took my reservations with no problems, no issues, no complaints.

Then the next day... they sent you a text message to confirm your reservation which I like so that's pretty cool..

So as my first time here ...the atmosphere is cool.. the bathrooms are clean but to me the tables were small..
You need space it's when you know what it is that you want to order... however the food was really good.. the flavor was good and even when you cooked it the meat was good..

For the menu and what you get I thought was pretty good so the only reason I gave four stars is because I wish there was a little bit more space for my dishes I don't like to rush when I eat...

We always go to Henderson location and it's always been a great dining except that we have to wait for 30 to 1 hr to get a table but its worth a wait.Meanwhile the new location in Sahara ave. has always been a disaster. 
The First time dining experience was GREAT!
Second time sining experience was not so lucky, we order the kfc chicken and in the middle of our dining I was chewing on a RAW CHICKEN  and the rest of the chicken was crispy except that some of them were RAW when I cut it with the scissor. The Manager apoligize and got my meal free of charge but i got sick for 4 days. We gave it the benefit of the doubt that we went their with my 17 year old daughter and 8 year old son. Unfortunately they charge us a full prize for my 8 year old which is $21.99 coz he is above the height limit they have at the door which I even brought his birth certificate to show but they didn't even consider to even look at it, they just say, it is company's policy which is BS. We are both tall parents and our child's Grandparents are also tall which means we expect our kids to be above height average. So they should remove that 10 year old sign of the kids price for dining. We just left coz I don't want to argue and dine somewhere else.
Third and last dining experience was HORRIBLE!!! Listen people we like this place so much that we put aside all the negative experience we have BUT this time we found a leg of a cockroach in my Chadol beef and I point it out to our server. Manager came and he says he things it's from the pineapple on a Hawaiian beef. We told him it didn't came from the Hawaiian beef it came from the chafdol beef brisket, he says ok I will just replace your Chadol beef order.

Anyway, this is a newer location. Used to go to the one by the galleria mall in Henderson. 

The place is nice, the service is on point and super quick and the long and many choices of meat is superb. Small portions to try more meats is definitely up my alley. All for about $20? Yesssssss!! Haha. 

It is a little loud sometimes but its not too bad. You can tell it caters more to the younger demographic instead of an older group of 60yrs plus. But who am I to say what people's preferences are? Grandma can eat and jam to some loud tunes for sure. 

Anyway, TRY THE PREMIUM STEAK. Cuts like butter and holy hell, it so good if you know how to grill it. Brisket, thick pork belly, tiny intestines, Korean Fried Chicken, Pork Cheese Katsu!!!,Jap Chae and a lot more. The list goes on and nothing I've tried has disappointed.

5073431,2018-05-14,1,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"The best places are found spur of the moment.  My wife and I have been on a personal trek to find the best Korean BBQ.

Invariably, the services comes at a cost of ambiance or service.  Not so Gen.  they've stepped up their game by offering a massive 36 item menu for an AYCE - reasonably priced at $21.99.

Their premium steak is served in 12-16 oz cuts 1/2 in thick.  All the fixins you can expect from a Korean BBQ.

The ambiance is bathed in blue hues - we'll have to come back at night instead of dusk.  Service is over the top.  As you'll have guessed, I am impressed by the sixth sense good servers have - realizing before you do, that you've finished your pop or need a refill of bean paste.

Special mention goes out to Prince, who did just that.  Have I mentioned that their hosts announce party size and the line cooks cheer?  

I recommend this place and give it 5 stars for service, ambiance, cleanliness, and for the delicious food.  We'll be back.

Update: Mothers Day dinner.

Consistency ranks high with me.  This place delivers.  Having worked through the food coma this place put me in last time, I was able to take my time with dinner - I'm ex-military, so I eat like it's my last day on earth with one plate I'm sharing with a fat kid.

The crew here is the envy of any 5-Star, Michelin rated establishment.  When was the last time I seen a cleanup guy really put some elbow grease to a particularly stubborn stain?  I did.  Tonight.  Everyone works.  In a full service restaurant, table turning is key.  The faster you can have an available table the greater it is in profits to the owners.  They trained their crew exceptionally well here.  I had the privilege of being part of a tightknit unit during a particularly exhausting mission.  We were on point.

The wine pork belly looked and tasted like literal crap. I don't understand how they can charge for any of this?? The service from our non-server, Austin, was the only amazing part. I think our server thought he was working in a Chinese restaurant because he said ""I don't read Chinese"" when we accidentally pointed at the Korean portion of the menu.. he was always not really around which was unimpressive because the other table's servers were around a heck of a lot more. Also, we asked to change the meat pan and he threw away pieces of our meat without asking if we wanted it.. this was our first course so we were pretty freaking starved after waiting for an hour after they told us it was a 30-45 min wait.. Everything we ordered was appalling. I cannot believe I wasted my calories and money on such mediocre food.. it makes me so sad!! My friend said ""it was edible.."", but I disagree..

When we were going to be seated they checked my sons height and confirmed that he would be half price. They measured him 2 times. Same price for him every time we go. Cool. We have a meal. Service from our serve and food was good as usual. 

When we went to close our check we were charged for 3 full priced meals. We mentioned it to our server and he went to go fix it. He tells us the front told him our son was full price. A few minutes pass and one of the ladies from the front..maybe the supervisor comes over. She was rude first off. We explained to her that we were told when we first checked in that our son was half price. She kept saying we had to go and remeasure our son. Keep in mind we were sitting in the back by the restrooms. It was the weekend so trays and people everywhere. At that moment when she kept insisting we get back up to have him measured for the 3rd time We got irritated. As I went to get up to take my son up there she said never mind and that he was half price. 

And then to add..with it being a super busy weekend and the commotion of everything. A full tray was spilled all over my guys shoes. Food and liquid went all over and some came on the table. We got an ""oops"". Things happen I know, but with the way the night was going it just added to the frustration.

AYCE was great and definitely affordable. I didn't check if there was WiFi, although dinner was so fun I didn't bother checking my phone once. There's no bike racks or outdoor dining area. Bathrooms are gender specific and clean.

Staff was on point. My server was a little unfriendly, although the bussers and other servers were nice. They checked on my table frequently to change my grill and to see if I needed anything. They did a great job! The only reason I didn't give this spot 5 stars was because of my server being a little rude and clumsy while grabbing empty plates or placing items on the table.

Overall, I'd definitely return to this restaurant. Walking in, there's lots of space for seating. It looks like a nightclub with Korean grills placed ever so well. Grills are hot and new.

The staff delivered excellent customer service. Our waiter Anthony B. made sure we were well taken care of and succeeded our expectations!  Everyone was very attentive and worked great as a team. The food was savory and hit all the right taste buds. My favorites are the brisket and the bbq beef ribs. Don't forget to add a macaroon ice cream sandwich to top off your whole experience. I recommend everyone try this Gen Korean BBQ place. We plan to come back soon and maybe even have a party here!,is-wPDckgfJefB047w80oQ,0,0,5,6lTTkEjBRlZcg3xC4t6Dfw

We arrived around 630p on a Saturday night. We were seated right away. The hostess was friendly and professional. We were promptly created by our server to take drinks & appetizer orders. 

I have to say this was probably one of the best dining experience I've had at a new restaurant. They staff were all on point. Service was impeccable. The food came out quickly after ordering and servers came by our table constantly checking up on us. 

This will be my new go to Korean BBQ spot. They have all you can eat for $22. Great selection of meat & appetizers. The quality of the meat was great. Two thumbs up! 

They are in the process of getting their liquor license. 

I will definitely be back with lots of friends & family. The restaurant is very spacious, modern, clean  and can accommodate big parties.",sjzv-c1k_HGGT9vZbfimWw,2,1,5,JXZ5PVRoL1H2pPBwYDf13w

5333164,2018-05-13,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"I have always been a huge fan of Gen. I have lost count of how many times I've been here over the past 2 years and I have never had a bad experience. The wait times are sometimes annoying but it is always worth it for the food. Unfortunately this last time I went made me question whether I should go back again. This past time I went I was with a party of 10, which of course is a large party so we knew we were going to have to wait a while. The wait time the hostess gave us was 45 minutes. Which we though was great. We had also asked her to not split up our party since I know sometimes they do that with larger parties. She assured me we would not be split up. After waiting 45 minutes we asked the hostess how much longer she thought it was going to be, and she pointed at a large group at a table and said she was going to seat us at that large table and that the guests at the table were paying and then leaving. She said it would me no more than 20 minutes. We waited another 30 minutes and watched the staff clear that table, then they called our names after waiting for a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes. When she walked us in she walked us to a different table that the other hostess said we were waiting on and tried to split us up into 3 different tables, which is something I had asked them not to do since the beginning. I voiced my frustration and after speaking to the manager she reluctantly moved us to the table we waited an extra 30 minutes for. 

Once we were seated the food and service was exceptional as always. It just really bothered me that they had us wait an extra 30 minutes on top of the 45 originally and told us they were putting us at one specific table that we waited the extra 30 minutes for then put us at another table that was open the whole time! 

I probably will not be coming back to this location, instead I will go back to the original Las Vegas Gen at Galleria Mall.",y6qDkZTaSGfzaW_2J1XT4A,0,0,2,7qXgOeTmgR7yIx6Rd-ln0w
5349192,2018-01-03,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"GEN! I loved going to Gen when they were still in SoCal. They used to have unmarinated short ribs and it was so delicious. Then they switched suppliers and they no longer carried the unmarinated short ribs so I stopped going as much. Then they came to Vegas but they were in Henderson and that was far. But they are pretty much the cheapest AYCE BBQ in Vegas at $21.99 per person. And now that they have opened up on Decatur and Sahara, they are much closer and maybe we can go more often!

Came here on Thursday night for dinner with my husband and some friends after my friend told us about their soft opening. Their establishment is pretty big with similar layouts to their Henderson location and Cali locations. What we did notice is that some tables, they have a hood for ventilation while other tables, their vent was on the sides of the grill. 

We ordered a bunch of their beef tongue and beef belly. They were really delicious. Just be sure not to overcook them or the meat will get tough. We also got their pork belly, brisket, steak, hawaiian, steak, bulgogi, japchae, and some other things. 

Everything was pretty good. Meat was decent. The japchae was so-so .. I've had better japchae at other places. It's still nice to have though so you won't be eating meat the whole time. There's salad as well. Unfortunately, they don't have the rice paper side dish yet since they are in soft opening. Though, honestly, I wouldn't count them having it all the time regardless of soft opening or grand opening cause their Henderson location doesn't always have it. 

Service was pretty good. They didn't have a limit on how much you can order, which is fantastic. They used to limit you to four a few years back but now they don't! The meats got delivered super fast but who knows if that'll stay that way. 

They were actually supposed to open earlier. They were working on getting some disposable grill plates for the grills since they are really hard to clean. They figured that it may be easier for them to just dispose it after it's been used. However, the problem with disposable grills is that it causes a lot of smoke when you use it. And because of that, they couldn't pass the health department with it. In the end, they had to scrap that idea and go along with the traditional grills. 

If Gen could get the adjustable hoods like the ones in Korea or the ones at Hobak and Doh, it would be so much better. Even though the establishment is brand new, their ventilation is horrible. Normally, a place takes a while for it to stink up with BBQ smell but I walked out smelling like some grilled short ribs and keep in mind that they are still in soft opening!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,0,1,4,EPpDFGSWQfB8elmz6IDb5w

5398757,2018-02-14,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"I really want to rate them 3.5 stars, but the lack of attention during the last half hour of our dining experience made me round down to 3. Definitely not a 4 star in my book. At first though, the service was top notch. We got our orders out quickly and the drinks were refilled promptly. After the restaurant got busier our waiter disappeared. We ordered meats and never got them. Finally we just gave up and asked for our check as the waiter was delivering food to another table. Now for the food:

The ban chan left much to be desired with very small portions (literally 2 tablespoons of potato salad). Additionally the taste of the ban chan was meh. The fish cake strips had no flavor, the Kim Chee was very mild and the pickled onions with jalapeños had no jalapeños. 

The meat:

Premium steak: a slab of beef with a huge strip of fat. Definitely wasn't ribeye but top sirloin I believe. It really didn't have much flavor but cooked nice and tender on the grill. 

Galbi short ribs: these weren't as sweet as I'm used to but still tasted great with the crisp of the grill. For a party of 3, the portion was 2 short ribs, which we reordered 4 times but got 3 actual orders. 

Beef belly: another tasty meat we ordered repeatedly due to the tiny portion size. This might have been my favorite meat of the meal. The beef bacon was thinly sliced and fatty which meant it cooked up quickly. 

Beef tongue: thinly sliced tongue that was very tender with a strong beefy flavor. It was very lean and went well with the sesame oil with salt and pepper combo. 

Red wine pork belly: tasted nothing of any pork belly I've ever had. This was more like a bland really tough piece of pork. Even though they only gave us 2 pieces of pork belly (bacon size), it was really hard for the 3 of us to choke it down. I'm not ashamed to say that I hid a portion of it under my rice! 

Spicy baby octopus: the portion was nice, 3 whole baby octopuses with a spicy red sauce tossed with sliced white onions and green onions. The taste was bold and flavorful. 

KFC: fried nuggets of chicken smothered in what tasted like a ketchup based sweet sauce. It was cold by the time it made it to our table and was therefore less appealing. 

Overall the food wasn't bad but when you're used to eating at other bbq joints with amazing sides (like Hwaro) it just leaves something to be desired. 

At the end of our meal we waited what seemed like an eternity just to get our check. This is my number 1 pet peeve. Don't make me chase you down to pay you!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,1,3,hn3qebjzowRvBS7QBwXoOA
5407201,2018-03-09,3,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Really swanky Korean bbq smoke house with NO ventilation what so ever. I know korean BBQ spots are smokey, but this location tops it. Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night & it was moderately packed. The restaurant is huge with a lot of seating. The smoke that builds up in this restaurant is horrendous. The vent on top of us did not even seem to work.  The front doors were left wide open during dinner service to get some fresh air in the place.  We noticed that the host would go outside several times to gasp for fresh air & when she returned she had to squint her  due to the heavy wall of smoke. I really hope they do fix their ventilation. 
Overall good Korean bbq selection, attentive & quick service. 
Tips:
- Hawaiian steak one of my top favorites. 
- 2 hour time limit.
- Mango Ice cream macaroons for the finale.",0O_QdaAP0WGO7qfuHd3m3A,6,2,3,COnp8iqlJP2Wkewup72gJw

I explained to the waiter, this was our first time at any korean BBQ.  He explained how everything worked and he gave us some recommendations, such as starting off with gyoza, which was perfect!  The server took our order, our raw meat arrived at our table in about 2 minutes.  Then it was on like donkey Kong!  

We grilled our meat and all the meats and the rest of the food was very tasty...I was impressed!

BUT I GAVE THIS PLACE 2 STARS BECAUSE OUR SERVER WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE PERSON SHE RUINED OUR EXPERIENCE HERE. I will add that we came here for a birthday dinner so yes our party was a little big but we gave this server no reason to be rude to us. I work in a high volume customer oriented place as well so I know how stressful it can get. At the end of our meal, we asked to have a check for our table of FOUR since our party was split up at different tables AND SHE SAID that we can only do ONE payment. So after paying, we asked ANOTHER server just out of curiosity if it was possible to have paid with two payments and she said we could've done 3 payments if we wanted. Our server's name was CRIZALAYNNE so if you want to have a good experience there I would ask for a different server if you end up with her.

1. Banchan dishes are small and we had to order some of them repeatedly and oftentimes the waiters would just forget to bring them.

2. Their bulgogi marinade is unlike any I've tried. Seems to lack the traditional sweetness, soy and other requisite ingredients. Not sure how you can mess up this quintessential Korean dish.

3. Very loud music, too much party atmosphere. It's not the strip.

4. Full price for any kid over 7 years old, based on height. Not even my 9 year old was even close to eating $22 worth of bbq.

Thumbs up for the nice green tea salt, a nice surprise that you can't find too easily elsewhere. Banchan recipes were tasty and fresh. Garlic calamari was a hit. So was the head-on shrimp.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,1,0,4,-nzALvUnIKOMQRfg37S-MQ

When we first walked in, we were surprised to see how spacious it is and a lot of seating. We were thinking it's going to be crazy pack with a long wait like it is back in the Bay. We were happily greeted by everyone that works there. Let me tell you something, BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! They are so on it! I love it!! Once we got seated, our server, Justin, was literally there to take our orders and the food came out to cook less then 2 minutes later. They would come and check on us so often that we always had a full glass of water and more food coming in. They would seriously take the empty plates as soon as we put it down.

I know dinner is around $20-$26 a person but I haven't had the dinner at that location yet. I'll update this once I do! No beer or alcohol served yet but they will soon. My advice is, use the tongs to put all your meat in there slowly versus throw in everything on the grill.. especially if it has liquid on there! Some people were new and saw flames go up pretty high on their station lol. Let's please keep this location for a long time.. they just opened the end of December haha! This location doesn't have rice paper which was sad on my part because I love wrapping my meats with it but they do have daikon.

I will be back this weekend!!!!,6Bqk6CnueVJFGT_gAyOVIA,0,0,5,muNPTViw0i9xzZpXU7d0QQ
5789426,2018-02-27,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,So happy for them opening one down the street from my house! The atmosphere is amazing and appreciate all the workers here. They are very nice and attentive to you while your eating. I love the choice in music that brings me back to my middle school days. I wish they had the rice paper wraps like in California so hopefully they add it.,Furcy6vV9If5NAniLuI1XA,0,1,5,eFYDMFJJAUPK0zbeleZCDw
5790651,2018-05-10,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"This is our second time visiting Gen korean BBQ house, however at a different location. The atmosphere is the same as other locations, good vibes, good music in the background. Our service was very friendly and attentive. The food is great, but it seems like its not too much of a high quality meat but then again it is an all you can eat spot. I would definitely dine here again because im an extreme meat eater and who is to pass up a good deal on all you can eat?",2wy6iFvLpFiP4kQNiHSQgg,0,0,4,b8HBvJPs7p2jiuh6G9m1QQ

5846969,2018-04-17,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,I have eaten at different Korean bbq  spots.  I have to say that this one has a very good menu selection and that the meats are quality cuts. Very good.   Waiter was very nice.   Only thing is that they don't have steamed eggs and rice paper wraps,X7xFbUUSx30YDir8V3mozw,0,0,5,jZLohuG0U0LAlcvyOh1MLQ
5879028,2018-03-18,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"UPDATE: We were so excited for Galbi that we decided to drive all the way to the Henderson location. We hauled our 4 kids (7, 5, 3 and 3m) all the way across town to eat. As soon as we got there, you can feel their welcome. Totally different atmosphere! Thankfully, we only waited about 10 minutes for them to get a booth ready. As soon as we sat down, ordered drinks and the first round of food. Food was cooked and in our kids bellies within 10 minutes from the time we sat down. Waiters and hostesses were amazing!!! Made sure our kids were ok with everything. 

Crappiest service ever!!!! Every where you turn, there was an employee. I think there were more employees than there were guests. All those employees, and they still couldnt get our business. Three groups were seated before us. Ok, they were smaller groups. Fine. A party of 3 seated at a table that we could've fit on? Wait, why? Ok, whatever, maybe there's a better location for us. I ask the manager how much longer and they said they're getting the table ready right now. But then, a bigger group gets seated before us? And they came in after us? Wtf?! That's when they knew they f***ed up. You can see it in their faces. The hostess started talking on her headset and looked around and started typing on her iPad. Yup, we left. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there until they figure out their flow. It's like no one knows what they're doing.",ABq1H4Cc2nD3j_d_AQMWjg,1,0,1,ZsOrObYCpamELAqWmQqpDA
5900200,2018-04-10,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,The meet is so not fresh. As soon as it touches the meet separates. Meets have excessive fat. Chicken was bad that it tasted sour. The restaurant has a lot of room for improvement.,0ZNJK6GXNxdOH8ahQDV1GA,0,0,1,3UPPTrXMgdZySV-OCWp0FQ
5900473,2018-04-07,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"My favorite Korean BBQ in all of Las Vegas! I've been to many and there are other good ones but Gen has become my favorite. 

I've been to Gen about 5 times since it opened and it has the best service  and excellent quality of food. 

It is all you can eat for 2 hours and has tasty hot food from the kitchen delivered which is nice to have while we cook your own meat. The staff always asks if we need anything and changes our grill top frequently.

We will absolutely be back at Gen time and time again!",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,5,x650LWVZBXH74e_r3ELThQ
5915282,2018-06-23,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Gen is what I would consider the In &Out of the KBBQ category. Prior to these guys showing up in the Vegas valley all that you would ever hear from ex-Californians was ""OMG you have to try Gen"" ""Gen is the best KBBQ place ever!!"" Honestly to me it's the in-and-out nostalgia complex defined. 

BUT I will say the following statements:
The Gen product is consistent across their chains; the Vegas locations are on par with the Tustin, CA location. 
Gen provides a environment that's comfortable and appealing to wehgukin/baeg-in. Meaning that the customer service what you expect from a standard restaurant in America (using Asian bias standard for all restaurants). 

They provide a solid spread of Bon-Chon and are very prudent in ensuring that your little dishes never run empty. 

The cooked dishes are OK however nothing to write in detail about. It's hard to write overflowing adjectives about the KFC and gyoza. Both are ok but not what you come here for. The main event here is the meat. First and foremost +1 star on the fact that they have Kalbi on their AYCE menu. Most KBBQ places either charge extra for Kalbi or limit it to one order. 
The cuts of the meat are good quality the Chadol (brisket), Samgyubsal (pork belly) and Hangjungsal(pork jowls) are some of my standard favorites and were top notch. 
The saucy meats: Beef Bulgogi, Kalbi and Spicy Pork were very good as well. 
My suggestion is to starts with the unsauced meats and then do the saucy stuff; this way your taste buds are not killed from the Gochujang if you are not used to it. 

For those who are just venturing into Korean foods, Gen is a good starting point to get introduced to the flavors w/o getting yelled at by an Ajima or getting blown away by the power of Gochujang.

Enjoy the wait for this place; it's worth it (as long its less than a 1/2 hour).",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,1,0,4,NLcv2hVOO6G4YwwhS01nJw

5985744,2018-03-24,0,8-8btzuYZCqEVOPwk0YYfA,"Service here was a little slow at first with taking our initial order but after they more than made up for it as we progressed through the meal.  
We had asked for two clean trays to place our cooked meats and they were so efficient that before we could even move them onto the table for use in the area we were needing them someone attempted to pick them up multiple times, assuming we were finished with them based on location on the table.  
There is a 2 hour limit on your occupation time at the table, plenty of time since they were so efficient with delivering items with little to no delay.  
There was a short line when we went because it is such a popular establishment around dinner so plan to wait a little especially with a larger party.  Well worth the wait however!",sGI1svtG_retrGgnythe1g,1,0,4,4PUCbhQ3gubPIv5M3LZk9g
