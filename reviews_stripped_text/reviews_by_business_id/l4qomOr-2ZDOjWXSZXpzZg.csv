It was my first time so I did not know what to order but Pho Rose menu offered different variety of dishes. My eye caught the ""Grilled Chicken & Rice"" dish so i decided to give it a shot. It didn't take long to get the food that I wanted which was approximately 3-6min. I was really impressed how much food there was in my plate!

Even though I have been here several times, I have always ordered to-go and every time I come by they never say ""Hi or Bye or Thank you or not even a Come again."" But I do come back since I don't want to drive to Chinatown. 

Okay now to the food...I usually order the Pho with rare steak and with extra tripe for $7.95 and the spring rolls with the peanut sauce is probably my favorite at this place. As for the Chinese food I would rate it as A-O-K, I've had better.

522737,2013-02-27,0,l4qomOr-2ZDOjWXSZXpzZg,"We have been going to Pho Rose for 6 years now and for being a local (mostly) Vietnamese restaurant, pretty darn good! The chef is Vietnamese and Chinese while his wife is Vietnamese, so they're definitely authentic.  I've certainly had better pho, but we live in the heart of Summerlin and nothing's that good that im going to drive 20 more minutes to satisfy a craving;  Pho Rose will certainly suffice. This place is definitely ""mom and pop"" so dont come in expecting great service and ambiance; we come here for the food. It's like going to NYC or SF and expecting polite conversation from our fav chinese take-out. Its not gonna happen, so just order your food and enjoy. If you want customer service, there's a Cheesecake Factory or PF Changs down the road to meet your superficial needs.  

We have take-out at least once a week (usually Pho Rare Steak or Beef Vermicelli and fried egg rolls). Their beef vermicelli is hands down some of the best I've had! The lean meat is marinated in a lemongrass marinade with just the right fixing of romaine lettuce, vermicelli, bean sprouts, topped with chopped peanuts and fried and green onions seasoned with nuoc cham and chili paste. With regard to the pho, there are days when the broth is too fresh (yes, too fresh) and the flavors havent integrated all too well yet, but i cant give a bad review for that. It happens. For the most part, they consistently have good broth that's well balanced without one spice overwhelming the other. They use good, tender steak and their herbs are always fresh.  I love how people whine about the price--I mean really? What do you expect? If you think that's too steep a price to have someone make a 16+hr broth, find good sirloin or filet mignon, and fresh thai basil served in a pretty generous bowl, then go get yourself a family meal at KFC if you're looking for a deal. UN-freakinbelievable! 

I love how most of the bad reviews are from ""Westerners"" that have the audacity to critique cuisine as if theyre an expert on asian food when it sounds nothing more than a trendy claim to say ""yeah! ive had it before"" during their next attempt at foodie conversation. Im Asian and i am no novice when it comes to Vietnamese food and my husband is French/Vienamese so he's been eating it forever, so I feel our review is worth it's weight in gold. To reiterate, not THE best ever, but if you live in the area, it'll satisfy the craving if you're not up for the Chinatown drive. 

Note: Don't recommend ordering Pho take-out unless you know how to reheat and plate correctly. Otherwise, the noodles and meat will get tough.",AAwDfOmg5j5_JegL-4SwvA,1,0,4,JQo3cc1thMShCR5sElPzdA

Our server placed her finger on the menu and informed us what was and what wasn't available. 

I went for a grilled chicken and eggroll vermicelli bowl which was okay and the portion was also big. The meal was pleasant but compared to some of my other favorite Vietnamese restaurants, this place took a back seat.

Lunch specials are $6 for a main, rice, and a cheese wonton- the beef and broccoli was surprisingly good, with tons of FRESH broccoli instead of the usual flavorless, frozen kind. The spring rolls are okay, always fresh and decently filled. 

The vermicelli/bun dishes are just okay: meats are bland, minimal veggies used. When grabbing to go, this is crammed into a takeout box that makes it difficult to mix.

I usually get the cold rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and an egg roll - pretty straightforward and really, really hard to botch.

Well, it was pretty much botched.  -_-

The only reason this place gets any kind of stars is their grilled pork is to DIE for.  Now why would I only give it two stars?  You get about two pieces for your ENTIRE bowl.  And not like, LARGE pieces - normal sized bowl pieces.  Everything else is mediocre vermicelli, some carrots and bean sprouts, and an OBNOXIOUS amount of lettuce.

Still hoping for the best, I tried the egg roll.  Last time I checked, egg rolls shouldn't be rubbery.  How does that happen?  I really don't know.

Fish sauce was not on par, it tasted like it was old.  In fact, everything but the pork tasted old... and I got this around lunchtime.  Eck.

Very tiny inside and I had to ask 3 times to get some hoisin sauce.  I tried getting sriracha as well but I guess there was a communication snafu.  The lady was friendly.

This place is bleh if you want to satisfy your cravings if you do not want to drive a distance and you live in the close vicinity.  (if you are willing to sacrifice quality and value)

However my concern is price value to quantity.  The prices are reasonable for what it should be, but for the amount of meat?  Mind you this is not just a Vietnamese place...for goodness sake it's in the name ""PHO"" Rose...so shouldn't they focus on Pho?  My gosh...I have ordered a Combo to go, and boy were they stingy with the pieces.  We don't pay for the rice noodles to just fill you up...common, it is no wonder this place has a sad rating.  I am actually surprise TETSURO P. gave such a high 5 stars...must be a relative of the owner...or he must be ________ (fill in the blank)  I hope Tetsuro was being sarcastic, cause you will find better Pho in Utah than here!

The broth is respectable and passes for okay.  but like I said Pho Rose fails to deliver even mediocre levels of appreciation.  It really is sad to see such a place fail...when it could actually be something good.

The chicken pho broth was salty and oily and they attempted to mask the bad flavor with an extra heaping portion of chopped garlic. Didn't do the job. The other person at the table had bbq chicken vermicelli and the chicken tasted like reheated burger king chicken tendors while the noodles had a plastic, almost musty flavor to them.  
The side of pho fixins came equipped with old browning bean sprouts and basil. Definitely no where near any of the decent pho spots on Spring Mountain. If you live on the North side of town and want good pho, it is definitely worth skipping Pho Rose and driving, or taking the bus, to Spring Mountain.

If you can drive the extra few miles to go to Chinatown, do it! I can't believe this place is still in business. 

My gripe was with the waitress who I assume is also the owner judging from the reviews. I went in there by myself to get a quick bite to eat. It was completely empty. I ordered my usual pho and I requested no cilantro. When it came out, low and behold, there was cilantro everywhere. When I mentioned this, she became irate and told me to pick it out myself because she was busy. At this time, there was 1 other couple in the entire restaurant! How busy can you possibly be? Oh and by the way, I'm allergic to cilantro! So picking it out of my soup is actually not an option! I made her make me a new one. She said fine. Talk about a stick up your ass!

Unless you're in Chinatown, pickings are slim in the Northwest for Asian eats.  Pho Rose is a mom and pop shop serving both Vietnamese and Chinese food. I remember coming here in 2004 B.Y. (before Yelp) and having some tasty Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef).

That was 10 years ago, and I wasn't sure if ownership changed throughout the years, so we gave it a go once again.  Perusing the menu I see Bo Luc Lac, so I had my mind set on that only to be told that they don't have that and about three other items in that section of the menu...WTH? So unfortunately,  I opted for the Grilled Chicken Plate and Wifey had the Grilled Chicken and Egg Roll Vermicelli Bowl. Everything tasted pretty good and the portions here are fairly generous. 

Service was good and I guess if convenience is priority for you, then you may want to pay a visit to Pho Rose.   ALOHA!!!

I found myself with a hankerin' for a fresh spring roll and some grilled pork on vermicelli... so decided to try Pho Rose.  It was a smidge off of the typical lunch hour, so I wasn't shocked that I was the only person in there other than the family who seems to own it. Now, seeing a person reading the paper, or checking their email on their phone at a family owned place is not completely off-putting to me, as I have a soft spot in my heart for mom and pop joints. Thing is, they didn't exactly look up with a smile when I entered.  One of them got up, no change of expression, and put the menus on a table - then walked away. I may like the local dive, but.... you'd best smile at me.  Either way, I perused. Spring roll - check. Grilled pork and egg roll on vermicelli - check. 
Well. The spring roll LOOKED good, but upon closer inspection, it was clear that it wasn't made just then.  The shrimp was cut very thin, and the pork in it was very dry.  Hmph. Then the vermicelli came. Now, before I describe this, the price on this dish was not high. $7 and change I believe, however, I would have preferred to pay an extra dollar and get better quality. The pork, though the taste was delish, was sparse and very grisselly (is that a word?). The eggrolls were ok, but some of the meat (pork) inside appeared to be pink, which I interpreted as not fully cooked. Eeek. Uncooked pork??  I took those out. The sauce was yummy, and the veggies (cucumber and carrots) were cut larger than I'm used to in this dish.  
I'll give this place one more try another time, but at this point, it looks like I'll still be making the trek to Chinatown for my authentic Vietnamese.",sM0FJN2NfXBmPjOgz7tv-g,2,2,3,-Z69va2ZEjWIiQSa1YpZrw

The first occasion I had surgery to extract some of my teeth...I could barely open my mouth and my throat was sore. My mouth was numb and I sounded funny when I talked. I needed some Pho because under my current condition it was the easiest thing to eat and 9 times out of 10 it cures my sore throat. I took my Pho to go and couldn't wait to get home to eat it. I made the mistake of accidentally ordering the meat rare. I opened the raw meat while I was watching an episode of True Blood ...what timing! It was no big deal I put it in the microwave then fixed the soup. I thought it would be messy taking soup to go but they separated the veggies, the meat and the broth. Everything stayed nice and tidy. I don't eat Pho all the time so I'm not an expert but it tasted good and cured my sore throat! 

The second occasion happened this past Monday. One of my friends from San Diego was down and we were meeting up north . It was getting kind of late so she and her husband were hungry by the time we met up. Her husband was craving Pho unfortunately there isn't any Pho restaurants near Durango and the 95 that I know about so I took them to Pho Rose. It was nice to see that they also serve Chinese food there because I didn't feel like having any soup. 

We started off with the egg rolls that came with veggies like lettuce that I wrapped around the rolls before I dipped it in sweet and sour sauce. It's the first time that I wrapped my egg rolls with lettuce it tasted more refreshing that way. 

Walnut Shrimp was also ordered . In order to like this dish you have to be a fan of mayo because there is a lot of it on this dish. It was good. 

My main entree was the beef curry . It was decent but not spicy enough for me. I also felt the rice that they served with the meal looked bottom of the barrel old. It had that look of when you scrape the last of the rice out of the rice cooker . Sorry I don't like my rice crunchy.

4654987,2015-04-26,6,l4qomOr-2ZDOjWXSZXpzZg,"Pho Rose is a a restaurant specializing in both Chinese and Vietnamese food. It is located in the Albertson's-anchored shopping center at the Northeast corner of Buffalo and Vegas Drives near Summerlin Parkway. 

   This past winter when I had been commuting between Henderson and my podiatrist in northwest Las Vegas, there were a few times  I caught the Chinese food lunch special at Pho Rose. 

  On two visits I ordered the lo mein lunch special and and on a third visit I ordered pepper steak. Both specials are $5.99 before a beverage. The lunch special came with soup of the day which I expected to be egg drop soup and white rice. Both the lo mein and pepper steak were flavorful. I thought the scallions added to the flavor of the lo mein. The pepper steak was interspersed with onions and peppers that complemented the meat. My complaint is over the fact that the lunch specials only included white rice. The owner and the menu never led me to believe that there is the option of fried or brown rice with the entree. I am not a big fan of white rice. This brought down the pepper steak and lo mein. Here on my plate was half a portion of a flavorful entree and ordinary white rice. On two of my visits I drank hot tea and on the third a can of Coke. I love the train that Chinese restaurants serve and this was no exception. 

  I knew I was going to be here three times. It's near Summerlin Parkway the east-West spur freeway of US 95 that put me close to my Podiatrost's office. My intention was to order a different item each time then ultimately write the review. The dilemma is that their lunch special features around ten entrees. 

   The $5.99 lunch specials that really add up to nearly $10  with a beverage and tip is a good deal. Really it's slightly more money than McDonald's. Where the value is Pho Rose's strong point during the lunch hours, customer service is their weak point. The woman who is most likely an owner never smiled or made the effort to make me feel welcome. The customer service here severely trailed behind Diamond China 2 and China Tango Bistro ( two Chinese restaurants I recently dined in) . On my second visit, I arrived here around 11:05 a.m. The same woman stated that the soup wasn't ready because they just opened and to come back around 11:30. Fortunately there was a Starbuck's nearby in the Albertson's. The lunch menu does specify that the lunch specials are 11 to 4. Overall, the customer service was plain in similar style to the white rice. 

  The dining experience is similar to a take out style restaurant with tables. Because it was rarely busy during lunch, available tables were plentiful. Overhead pop music played. The tables and utensils were clean. 
  There is no reason for me to rush back to Pho Rose in the immediate future. When it comes to Chinese food there are better restaurants. 


Likes: Good value. Good food. Hot tea. Clean. 
Dislikes: Not friendly. Only white rice comes with the lunch special.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,6,3,pzoclkZG1aTDPmkFUwyEFQ

4774157,2014-03-06,0,l4qomOr-2ZDOjWXSZXpzZg,"This is my go-to Pho place for several reasons.   It is super close to my house in comparison to all the other pho places in vegas.  It is never over crowded, and the service is good.  I usually order to go and it is always ready when I get there.  I get the number seven, just the simple pho with the raw meat that cooks when I throw it in the broth. The serving size is GREAT, I feel as though I almost get more when I order to go? But I'm not sure. They don't skimp on the meat, I think it is the perfect amount and there are always lots of the veggies and such in my to go box, I love it.  I do always ask for a side of sriracha, I can't eat pho without it.  Great flavor over all! And a huge serving, I'm always extremely full after and thats saying something for me.  I have sat down to eat several times and enjoyed it.  They do charge by the can for sodas which is a little annoying, but makes sense since it is a small non-chain restaurant. I can understand that. The lady at the front is very quiet service wise but I get the feeling it is just because of language differences etc, to be blunt (not because she is unfriendly or anything).

I keep going because I love pho and its conveniently located near my work.  The soup base is decent but you have to flavor it with a lot of hoisen and sriracha. Not a big selection like other pho joints in town. Don't expect a lot of meat if you're hungry. I once ordered a grilled chicken and egg roll vermicelli bowl and got 2 small pieces of chicken. It did nothing for me. The egg rolls are barely passable. The filling is skimpy and you eat mostly fried wrapper. 
Yes I'm a repeat customer but only because its the only place to get pho in that area.  Would i recommended it? No. There's many many other places to get good pho.

Soup was a bit too bland for my liking, but nothing a lot of hot sauce cannot fix! 

What brought the rating down was the service, or the lack thereof. The main server, probably the owner, was extremely unfriendly. Didn't say hi, didn't say anything really, and didn't even smile or acknowledge us.

5939217,2012-07-19,14,l4qomOr-2ZDOjWXSZXpzZg,"All my Yelp friends know that I have this Yelp ""Schtick"" where I try to maintain this image of a conceited, and narcissistic villain who does nothing but piss off everyone reading. Most of my reviews consist of me bragging about how unrealistically hot I am, how even my cheapest article of clothes costs thousands of dollars, how awesome my hair looks, and how your personal opinions are WRONG and my opinions are Scientific Facts. If I were a Buddhist, I would chose to be reincarnated as myself. Though it is true that I have too much money to spend and an extremely high opinion of myself, what I am practically trying to do is exactly what the ""heel character""(aka the bad guy) does at the Pro-Wrestling shows. I talk sh!t on every onlooker until they can't stand it anymore and send me tons of death threats, insults, and angry messages. Sometimes I wonder if I have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, because I seem to get high on annoying and pissing people off.  But, I promise that this will be my last Schtick review.....maybe..

Now on to the review....

People in Las Vegas are pretty stupid, but people in NW Las Vegas are even worse. Las Vegas is like DUMB and NW Vegas is like DUMBER. So practically what we got here is a city full of Harrys and Lloyds. So, I can understand why some people would give this place a low-rating because they don't have the intelligence, class, and sophistication(Like I have) to enjoy such a fine bowl of Vietnamese Pho.

The Pho itself is extremely oily. This is natural! You really want to see oil rise to the top of soups like Pho and Tonkatsu Ramen. Why? Because that is the first visual indication that the broth is made from boiling bones for over 16+ hours.  If the soup has no oils rise to the top, it means that either the bones were not boiled long enough or they used a powder mix to make the broth.  The only times I ever see anything more greasy and oily than Natural Pho is when I have to look at the profile pictures of the Elite Yelper's faces(Of course not counting the Elites who are on my friends list, who are all like extremely hot like myself).

The Steak they use at PHO ROSE is very tender, soft, and lean. I think they might be using sirloin.  Just a note: I know that most of you NW Vegas residents live paycheck-to-paycheck. I know most you guys barely make enough money to pay the bills. I also know that you are used to eating Grade F Low Quality beef from Walmart. But, Sophisticated(like me), wealthy(like me), and Upper-Class people(like me), eat nothing but Organic Sirloin and Filet everyday. So unlike you guys, I know a good piece of steak when I see one. And, PHO ROSE has some good quality meat. 

Okay...the portions here are not as big as the places on Spring Mountain. But, the prices are a bit lower. Also, lets factor in the convenience of not having to drive 30 minutes in bad traffic to Spring Mountain and Valley View.  You know, if you have to complain about a $7.50 bowl of Pho being too expensive then you shouldn't be eating out at all. You should be saving your welfare checks to pay rent at your weekly-rate roach infested apartments.  So maybe next time, don't blow your paycheck on your gambling addiction, and don't spend so much money getting drunk and stupid at bars...... and maybe you won't have to complain about $7.00 being ""too expensive"". 

Okay... I noticed my Yelp Friend Mike C gave this place a 1-star review. I respect his review. I noticed he last ate here in 2010. I think he should give this place another try because I think they have made a lot of changes.

So, I would eat here again on account of the food, service, and convenience.  The only thing that might keep me away is the fact that this place is located near Summerlin. I don't know why, but every time I come back to Summerlin, the people just keep getting uglier!  Does a privileged and good looking guy like me really want to lower his standards and eat amongst the obese alcoholic bottom feeders of Summerlin? 

Anyway...PHO ROSE gets 5-Stars for being the best Pho in the NW.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,12,11,5,mXYiuu9wWZop4_fnblascA
