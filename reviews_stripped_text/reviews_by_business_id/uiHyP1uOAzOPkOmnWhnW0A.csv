It's a bowl of awesomeness topped with WINNING. I used to think Pho was the perfect cure for a hangover, but Menudo tops that now. Too bad it's only available on the weekends.

The Carne Asada Burrito and fries are my typical order. The burrito is a good size and is just delicious. The fries are probably one of the best carne asada fries I've tried on the west coast. You get a giant portion with LOADS and LOADS of toppings!",cw1cO7zGarYJmIkdGdNdEg,0,1,4,lP-ygWZ_EFb77uBZa5nM9Q

731666,2013-06-08,0,uiHyP1uOAzOPkOmnWhnW0A,"The fish burritos, nachos, and combo plates from Roberto's are simply awesome!  A fish burrito contains two big breaded fish planks, loads of cabbage, salsa and tartar sauce, and probably weighs about a pound and a half, and is only five bucks.  The chicken and carne asada burritos are loaded and delicious as well.  

I think the shrimp burrito recipe needs to be revamped, but I can overlook this in favor of all the things that they do absolutely perfectly.  The salsa bar is also awesome, and they have plenty of little plastic cups with snap-on lids to take salsa to go.  It's preservative free and therefore highly perishable, but that is a sign of great quality.  They also have whole jalapenos and pickled spicy veggies if that's your thing, just sitting there for free in a container in a bed of ice.

The locations my wife and I frequent are both close to UNLV.  One is directly across from the campus on Maryland Parkway and Harmon, behind the 7-11 store.  The other is in a really spotty neighborhood near Paradise and Twain I think.

808131,2014-12-18,6,uiHyP1uOAzOPkOmnWhnW0A,"I would like to start by saying that Roberto's has often been the destination my family and I would eat at. We normally love the food, however, food can only go so far when it comes to customer service. I am unsure if all locations follow the same ""uncaring"" attitude this location seemed to have, but for the sake of the business, I hope not. 

Tonight we ordered 2 beef burritos along with a variety of other dishes for carryout. We often find ourselves spending  well over 30-40 dollars for the entire family, and we do this quite often throughout the year. The 2 beef burritos were EXTREMELY salty, and we decided to call the location and ask for 2 new burritos to be made, specifically Carne Asada. The employee began to tell us that there is absolutely no salt in the ingredients list for the burrito, which I found very hard to believe. We decided to go to the store and speak with her, but the best response I could get was ""It's not my problem you didn't like the food, it's your problem."" Also, we were going to be held responsible for paying the difference for an order that was already misunderstood to begin with, and in theory, pay for the burritos that tasted awful. I cut many companies slack that support outstanding customer service because it is in human nature to make mistakes, and if the company is going to compensate for their misunderstandings and mistakes, there is no reason to be upset. A company that does not exercise this notion is destined to lose customers, and as one myself, I will find it very hard to mention Roberto's in the next conversation that includes dinner options.",8rhV5BuWzGv1sJ3H4vueew,9,7,1,M5HtPtgGycDPr9q1JI_rrg

The Bermuda and Cactus location did not allow the substitutions for his burrito so I just ordered my fries. We both had a craving for some Mexican food so I went to this location to get his food. 
Considering the late hour we arrived, the woman who helped me order my boyfriends burrito was very patient and willing to complete an order. I simply told her what my boyfriend wanted in a burrito and she helped make that happen by suggesting a specific burrito that was plain enough to add more toppings.

Located in Southern Highlands, a master-planned community located on the southern side of Las Vegas, on W. Cactus Avenue, a main thoroughfare through the community.  Sits next to a beauty salon.  Lots of free parking.   It's a chain, though, so they're located all over Nevada and California.

Atmosphere
Your standard ""walk up to the county and order your food and take it home"" or ""walk up to the counter and eat it inside because you're too hungry to wait to go back home"" restaurant.  It had festive colors on the walls.  Bathrooms in the rear of the restaurant.  Lots of wall outlets!  (Which was good because my phone was dying and I need somewhere to charge it!)

Service
It's not fast food, but you can tell the food is being made fresh to order, so there is a little bit of wait before your food is ready.  The cashier was very friendly and made small talk with me and my friend while we waited for our food.

Food/Drink
I'm from the East Coast, so we don't have ""real"" Mexican food.  My favorite fast-food chain is Del Taco (think of Taco Bell, but cheaper and you can get burgers and fries to go with your tacos).  So, when my friend told me that nothing is better than Roberto's I said I'd try it.  Decided to play it safe and order the chicken tacos.  Fresh chicken (I'm assuming chicken breasts that they grill, then slice and put inside the tortilla), shredded iceberg lettuce, and an abundance of shredded cheddar cheese on a warm, soft tortilla. Very simple, but very delicious and very authentic.  I'm disappointed that they don't have pico de gallo as a salsa option.  In my opinion, their red salsa was pretty bland and their green salsa was too watery.  But, they saving grace were their pickled carrots.  You think you're eating healthy because they're carrots, but they're not that healthy because they're pickled.  But, they were so good, I kept eating them long after I was done with the tacos.

I would go back just for the pickled carrots!  I gotta learn how to make this at home!",eq3_JEuCS0liJc-T7_gYlg,0,2,3,8WWRpkOmHx1i1XCLWv4Ysw

My go-to meal is the carne asada burrito. My cousin's go-to meal are the carne asada fries (and trust me they don't stiff you at all on the carne asada unlike other restaurants). Before, I would sometimes get the carne asada chimi chonga meal but no longer.

5043875,2015-08-23,0,uiHyP1uOAzOPkOmnWhnW0A,"First time at Roberto's and I'm not disappointed. I tried the number four, which comes with two tacos (beef or chicken), rice, and refried beans for $7. The rice and beans were excellent. At first i wad disappointed with the tacos as I did not think there looked to be a lot of chicken on them;  however, as i was eating them I quickly realized there was plenty of meat.  The hard shell tacos were good, but a little chewy. 


They seemed to have a pretty extensive menu with a wide range of entrees and sides.  The staff was pleasant.  I really liked that they have a little buffet where one can get their own salsas and toppings - they even have to go containers to make it easy! 

Overall, I will definitely be trying again.",GCAYup0s9eGAuW9NBQASDQ,0,0,4,gbvL3gGIz24ESU4XX6zbVQ

More of a 3.5 stars. I'm still a Fausto's over Roberto's fan, but as far as Roberto's this is one of the better locations in the southern area of Las Vegas. This is the only Roberto's I like and go to lately because family and friends live within a 2 mile radius. We usually order take out and eat at their house.  

Great things about this location: 
- DRIVE THRU!
- fast service
- rarely busy when I go. 
- Food is consistently good. Never had a bad experience with taste. 
- My go-tos are the burritos, carne asada fries, tortas, tacos, horchata. 

Most recently I had the carne asada torta. I really liked their bread. What I liked about their torta is the bread was soft with a little crisp on the outside. It was so soft that it fell apart easily while trying to eat the sandwich. Good and bad but I didn't mind, I just used a fork. Also the bread is huge, fills the take out container but the torta doesn't have as much meat as Fausto's torta.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,9,11,4,qEp1jHd6JxGH2fNW_AhGgg

And I really enjoy not cooking on Wednesday's for their $1 hard shell chicken tacos!! Only complaint would be it takes them some time to prepare the food. When u order in person it takes a good 20 minutes to get your food.,c7NTxwdmuHFEgDAEDyo8HA,0,0,4,yzdlCs9GGKLqrprBDz1SuQ

5374361,2018-03-08,0,uiHyP1uOAzOPkOmnWhnW0A,"My boyfriend and I love Roberto's and go quite often. We always get the same thing, carne asada fries. It's usually good although the past couple times we've eaten here haven't been very good. We usually eat inside and it's usually not very clean there's always a table or two that's sitting with food on it or crumbs and what not on the floor. Which really doesn't bother us too much we just sit at a clean table but lately it's been too much. The staff is never too friendly.  The last time we ate here I actually got a carne asada quesadilla and the meat was very fatty and some pieces looked like they weren't cooked all the way. It made the meal unappetizing and I didn't finish it. We took it home otherwise I would've asked for a new one. Today we went and got fries and they were pretty good but towards the end I get a fork full and right before I take the bite I noticed a long piece of hair tangled literally around the meat. I took it to the cashier and showed her and even she was disgusted. She tried pulling the hair out and the meat came with it dangling from it. It was disgusting and the fact that we basically already ate all the fries was even more gross to think about. It was taken care of but I won't be returning. This place just keeps going downhill.",5vDnwYNUp4qPjjenvRmYOA,0,0,2,uAn_CAkEgy3d28Hy6zQoGQ

5499003,2010-12-25,1,uiHyP1uOAzOPkOmnWhnW0A,"Why does everyone say Roberto's is only good when you're drunk? I heartily disagree!

I love the fact that their tacos are fresh corn tortillas wrapped around the meat of your choice, toothpicked shut and dropped into the deep fryer. Afterwards it's topped with lettuce, cotija and cheddar, and served with really, really good beans and rice.

The salsa roja packs a decent punch and a good flavor, I find the tomatillo salsa verde a little underwhelming, but a better match for the shredded chicken.

I also really like the carne asada tacos, with pico and guacamole, or the rolled tacos and guac. The tortas are friggin' huge. The carne asada fries are much-talked about but I think that might be one of those drunk foods.

The breakfast burritos are awesome, especially with bacon and roja.

I would advise staying away from the quesadillas, which are beyond greasy and rubbery. The chile relleno an enchiladas are a bit too cheesy and gooey for my taste, but it's certainly going to be to the liking of others.

I've been to a few Roberto's around the valley and this is the cleanest one I've ever seen. You could eat off the floor.

Of course, being all the way out in the soccer mom suburbs of Southern Highlands, there's nobody on the floor during the prime time drunken shenanigan hours.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,3,2,4,S_p0ZtqQu4Q39506nSIOYg

Food has too much cheese but isn't that what you want to soak up the alcohol???  The food is plentiful and cheap. I have tried many of the dishes here and most are adequate or above.   

The one serious standout is the chorizo breakfast burrito.   This is one serious oil tanker of a burrito.   It is easily two meals unless you have a serious hunger going on. 

For 10 bucks you can get a pile of decent food in a divey Mexican restaurant with a counter to order at and some quiet booths tucked in dim corners.
