This isn't the first time I can here. Almost every el polo loco I've been too have reduced their chicken sizes from the actual sizes!
I wish there's a law out there that also watches out for these things. I'm sure there is, I just don't know if they're out there, if they are then they really aren't doing their rounds!
It is the same as stealing a penny here and there in broad day light!

The only el polo loco that impressed me is the one in Carson, California. 

Maybe I'll come back to El polo loco one day once their chicken is back to the size that I'm actually paying for!

I visited just this past Wednesday to pick up an 8 piece dinner with two sides. Instead of hitting the drive thru and pissing a line of cars off with my large order, I decided to park and walk in to order. I walk in, make up my mind what I am going to get for sides and proceed to order my food. It wasn't overly busy, just a couple people ahead of me ordering and a couple diners eating. I order my food, get my receipt and that's when everything goes downhill.


The first thing I notice was what looked liked the manager/supervisor (she was wearing the dark green button up shirt) is standing behind the counter by the tortillas and is straight out texting on her phone. Right there, in front of customers, on the floor. She then sets her phone down on the same counter, possibly on top of the bagged tortillas, and proceeds to start throwing tortillas in the plastic baggies. No gloves. No hand washing. 

I was thinking WTF but tried to ignore what I saw, scooped some salsa into to-go containers and waited for my order. I then saw that my cashier was now scooping my sides with no gloves and if she washed her hands, that was the fastest hand wash in history. She was helping other people behind me when I was at the salsa bar so I don't know how she could have quickly made it to the hand washing station, washed for 30+ seconds and go back to the side dish hot trays. 

I know fast food jobs suck and a lot of time the workers are treated like complete crap. I understand and can sympathize with them, but I can't excuse improper food handling as having a ""crappy day at a crappy job."" Needless to say, those two incidents were enough to turn me off of this place.",BWnz69daxDZIkc5g6uEGpA,2,1,1,puUTNnJaN76bxtMDIcpGwg
4054678,2013-01-18,1,_paJE9yQfSvo25BKBQrKZA,"Scary when I considered eating at El Pollo Loco as eating healthy.  But it's healthier than most of the restaurants that I will frequent throughout the week.  I don't go to this particular Loco often, only when I'm getting my cut at Xpress Cuts.  

Cleanliness is hit or miss here.  Sometimes it's super clean and sometimes it's just missing some housekeeping.  But I put that blame on the guest that don't clean up after themselves.  

I really don't go outside the box when I visit El Pollo Loco. It's usually 5 Chicken Legs or their 3 piece combo.  Regardless what choose, I'm shredding the chicken meat and eating it burrito style.  

TIP:  This drive thru is crazy busy and at all times of the day. One reason this drive thru gets busy is because it wraps around Wells Fargo Bank.  There has to be at least 2 times I've been here where someone thought they were in line for the ATM.

Yet again say makes more mistakes! When my daughter went in to ask them to finish giving me us are complete order they tried to argue with her that we didn't have the missing items on our original order my daughter explained look at the receipt and no there it was listed they gave her her soda with plenty of attitude and when she asked can we have our sour cream that yet was missing again they argued with her again rather than look at the receipt and the girl at the counter was told to put the sour cream in a container. A mind you when I originally place my first order I paid extra to have a Coke and a half sour cream! My daughter was treated very rudely! Now mind you it wasn't a mistake that we had made it was the first time around!

The bowl was decidedly less presentable as it slid back in forth in the plastic to go container it was packaged in from all of the grease/oil in the ingredients. They also forgot to put the chicken on my bowl, so that was very disappointing. Besides that huge oversight, the seasoning of the ingredients was better than expected and the avocado was ripe, but it was a cardinal sin to leave off the chicken when it was the only protein on the entree and chicken is also in the name of the restaurant!

This place has messed up my order more than once.
The food is good sometimes, but i credit El Pollo Loco in general for their food being good, but each location is responsible for the service and quality, which this place lacks.
A few months back, they forgot one of my items, had to go back and get it. It sucks but mistakes happen. 

So I went there recently, and Im not sure how to feel. I ordered a Mango grilled salad, with chicken. I did not see a single mango... Leading me to believe I didn't get the right salad.... Second, the bottom was saturated in bean juice, and there was hardly a tablespoon of chicken... The idea of the salad, and what I did get tasted pretty good... So much room for improvement. It seems like they are pre packed, and just sit there waiting to be ordered.. Not fresh. 

Speaking of not fresh, the red tomato salsa in the little round cups.
 I got a few in my bag and decided to put some one my salad. WHOA mistake, it was ROTTEN, it literally tasted like an old dirty tomato, and dirt. It smelled of a molded vegetable. I almost threw up.

Worse, though, is that I have not had well made rice from this location in at least a year. The rice is what made me a El Pollo fan many years ago, and it's always a disappointment when it's not made correctly. It's almost always soggy--once I had rice so soggy that it congealed into a weird rice pudding kind of thing. But lately they've managed to make their rice even worse by failing to properly mix the seasoning, so I often find giant chunks of seasoning in my soggy rice.
