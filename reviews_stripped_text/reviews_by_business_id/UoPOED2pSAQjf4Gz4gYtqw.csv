337684,2011-06-08,2,UoPOED2pSAQjf4Gz4gYtqw,So i went here one late night freaking starving! So I decided to get something real quick. This carls jr was the first fast food I spotted. And my experience in this particular carls jr drive thru was theee worst service I have experienced in my life! First of all the woman at the drive thru took at least 3minutes to even respond and she got my order wrong twice! I actually had to pull up to the srive thru wondow because she could not get my order correct. Finally she gives me total with a rude tone and slams the window in my face while Im asking very politely if she can repeat my order. And to believe it or not that was only strike one for me! so finally she gets back to the window 5 min later (and I am not stretching the truth at all when I say she took 5 min) literally snatches the money from my hand (strike 2) and again slams the window in my face! Ugh! I was really getting to my very last nerve at this point. So she takes awhile to come back my food and of course she gets my order wrong. (strike 3) she over charged me! And surprisingly I kept my cool. So I drive away and get get home and she totally skimped me on my fries!  I dont know if this lady was out to get me or if someone is trying to test my patience! who knows! Maybe she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me? But this is THE LAST TIME im ever eating carls jr EVERRR!,sdrj6qjGp9EYaVvHzxg34w,1,1,1,VmpWo77pk2CHTQwl-qcI8w

At least the girl Serena working the window was a sweetheart. Not her fault, she's new. Fast food, means fast & hot!!!",dS9I5V0ggf7mPkdmYG_UHg,0,0,1,mtBVCP0N2uZbmzCbOBLOjg

I'm literally still waiting at he window, nobody has said anything to me so far, and nobody was in front of me, and it's been quite a few minutes, giving me enough time to write this post. The cashier did apologize though. Very slow service, will try my best not to come here again. Not the first time this has happened.",GTCKY8Vaos3Bz8SoXyC0qQ,0,0,1,cCzPoTaUPmcy5ILg6GT2og

I usually hit this location because it's close to the office, they have a good chicken salad and they give me a big glass of water at no charge.  But the last couple times I have been through, they were out of large salad bowls (offering two garden salads with a side of chicken for the same price - um, no thanks) and refused my water request.  Apparently now if you want a glass of water that is larger than a thimble, you have to pay full soda price.  I don't mind paying for the cup inventory but I'm not paying for something I can get from my tap.  And thanks for making me beg for the cup of water which had no ice in it and you didn't give me a straw to drink it with.  Too kind!",xL4EOIKW6ZRM06T1lMjb_w,1,0,2,fKPCjjzLp52ps-bE87yLEw

The only way I stop by is if I get coupons in the mail or something. This location is a little sketchy only because it's in the heart of ""THE STROLL"" Aside from that let's be honest, it isn't always a persons first choice to go to a fast food place that is attached to a gas station lol but when you are hungry you are hungry! The breakfast French toast sticks are amazing though! I came here the other morning to take them up on that buy one get one free offer for those. The gentleman working that morning was half asleep as I had to repeat my order twice and give him the coupon number through the intercom 3 times. Why was this already a process though? Sheesh let me just get my damn French toast sticks and be on my happy way. But no when you deal with people who don't have common sense it's never that easy to just ""be on your way"". Will I be back? Sure send me some more coupons :-) But until then 3 stars for the HALF attentive service....",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,2,3,Pbch1HG7W7BBAV-GMIwGyw
3278316,2017-01-21,0,UoPOED2pSAQjf4Gz4gYtqw,Came here for a quick bite to eat while my daughter cheered at The Orleans. Ordered two western bacon cheeseburgers with zucchini. And I must say. This has got to be the worse Carl's I've ever been too. Not only was my food horrible but the service was bad. My zucchinis were still cold and hard. And the burgers were not cooked probably. I couldn't even finish my food comfortably without thinking I'd get food poisoning. Never again!,csEXKIx9RnjAHX1EXv5sZg,1,0,1,M7BbtpJBdh2_YXPFUaSzKQ

I took a bite into my famous star and it had way too much sauce on it like I had to get about 30 napkins to wipe some off of it,who am I kidding I had to wipe most of the sauce off! The Western bacon cheese burger was awesome in every way! The chicken bacon and Swiss Burger is really good to!

If you need a quick meal, its not that bad. The service was really slow for some reason. There wasn't a lot of people inside, maybe the drive thru was busy.
