   My son and I went through the drive through (took forever). They have the nerve to ask ""is everything on the screen correct"".  After we got our food, we pulled forward in the drive-thru to allow traffic to move.  I explained to my son that we need to check and make sure we got everything....
   I ordered big Mac meal and happy meal -burger plain.
   They missed the toy and my fries and his burger... how?  We went inside and had to convince them that we really didn't get everything. They got what we were missing and we went home.
   My son was disappointed.  I ordered burger plain for a reason.  They were too busy chatting behind the counter to pay attention to the order they already screwed up. No apology. Nothing. 
   I would let this slide if this was the only time. Hire people that work!  I don't expect a five star meal but get the order right. If not the first time, at least don't screw it up twice!",qGRyN_oAZ-v42be-YMJXcg,2,0,1,m2tvzzv6dDOlcADVjIRFAg

I get a ""Go ahead with your order"" and then an ""ok, pull around for your total"". Would it kill them to have better customer service or at least use a customized greeting?

After I placed my ordered and pulled around, no one was at the first window. I sat there for a couple minutes before I decided to pull forward to the next window. When I got to the next window, I wasn't greeted or anything. The lady said, ""What was yo order?"", I responded and then she said, ""she said you didn't pay, you just pulled forward."" I responded with, ""she wasn't at the window, so I proceeded to a place I knew someone would be at."" She said, I don't know, but you have to pay"". She said it as if I was trying to steal. I gave her my money and she said that she would come back in a couple minutes.

About four minutes past and someone, maybe the manager, passed my food out of the window and then the lady came back and brought my change, a minutes after that.
