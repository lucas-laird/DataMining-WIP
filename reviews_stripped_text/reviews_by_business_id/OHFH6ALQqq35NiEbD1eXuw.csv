3863,2011-06-21,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"I was looking for a dim sum place while in Las Vegas and decided to check this place out after reading the reviews. I must say, I was definitely not disappointed.

The dim sum selection and taste is by far the best I've ever tasted in US. It was a pity that it was just 2 of us and we could only stomach that much food. I would have loved to try more.

My top top favorites:
- The egg tarts (they taste just like those you'd find in HK). We had 3 plates of that and I wish I could pack to bring home but they wouldn't taste as nice then. 

- The soya beancurd is so smooth and the ginger taste is very subtle that blends in with the beancurd. I've tasted the soya beancurd in another restaurant and it was just too gingery. We ordered additional 2 portions to go and had them chilled when we reached home. They tasted just as great chilled & warm.

- Chives dumplings were also good.

I would definitely visit this restaurant when I head to LV again. Service was also decent. Carts of dim sum were being pushed around the whole restaurant.",8ooGRxoD7F7Tn1lkcoF0Ig,0,0,4,3GUUOMLXmjXg9SyJ1dIW0w
18934,2011-06-06,3,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Yes, I know what you are thinking. How could dimsum in vegas be any good? or ever comparable to la dimsum. 
The food is just as good or better and there are more selections if you go an hour after it opens. We got there exactly when it opened and there were very few selections. After 30 minutes of eating and getting full, we were like, dam we should have came 1 hour later. Many more selections like small sizes of walnut shrimp!. (never seen that before).
Service is a little iffy, but what can you expect if it is an authentic chinese restaurant. Its definatlely authentic when the server throws the dimsum we order across the table like we were playing frisbee together in the park. 
Overall, its a solid dim sum place and pretty dam chinese. I would recconmmend if your craving some dimsum in vegas.",3B12S1yCa-CdTgjTwHvgig,2,0,4,Lh4U1GmrtXLQD186VzAtlQ

The service is just ok because every time we go we have to ask for our drinks twice. But really this place is about the Dim Sum which was great, there are always carts running around packed with food. The 'cart pushers' aren't very friendly or talkative but when you point to an item they give it to you so I'm not complaining. The prices are very reasonable for a family of four.

The service and selection are good and things are usually fresh and tasty. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I did get vegetables once that were way overcooked. Thinking about it now, I should have returned them and I'm sure they would have gotten me perfectly cooked ones but I had guests and didn't want to make a fuss. My bad.

185880,2017-04-28,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"We started coming here 5 years ago then they changed owners and the Dim Sum quality went down. So we didn't comeback for a longtime and started going to Orchid Garden instead. 

We decided one day 6 months ago to give them a shot one more time and they did a great job, so we started going back regularly 4-5 times a month. 

We went last week and it was very disorganized and disappointing. The dim sum was ICE cold and the dim sum carts weren't going in a rotation properly. On the way out the door we told one of the owners and he just smiled and shook his head, so come to find out he doesn't speak English?

Decided to give them another chance today. The dim sum carts were disorganized again, dim sum cold and now one of the items we ordered tasted like cleaning chemical that someone sprayed on the food. We tried to speak to another owner and come to find out she doesn't speak English either? How can you own a business in the US and not be able to affectively communicate in English? Good luck if you decide to try this place!

Either way we won't be back anytime soon. I guess we'll have to wait for another ownership change.",CTRWImRbTrkhgIm2oG4lcg,0,1,1,V0hv-Eyol5ZPmLNLTCETtA

I showed up alone at 5 pm on a Wednesday and ordered mostly off the dinner dim sum menu (short but adequate). The exceptional: steamed beef tripe, tender but just toothy enough for interest, fresh clean warm taste perfumed with ginger - excellent. I asked for pu-erh tea and it was very high grade for a restaurant - good body and a hint of chaparral in the aroma. Very good: black rice coconut cake - jelled and sweet w distinct favors, very sweet. Chicken shrimp pork in tofu skin wrapper with a nice light gravy. Quarter duck (asked for, half duck would have been too much) perfectly rich and crispy with a little sauce over excellent home pickled vegetables. Hot sauce came without asking. I way over ate. 
Solidly good service: sweet older man who seated me got a sparkle in his eye when I requested the pu erh. Friendly younger waiter; both checked regularly to make sure I had what I needed but left me quietly reading and typing. Very relaxing. 
Decor is aging a bit but clean, no smell, temp was good. I saw a stack of high chairs and booster seats. 
So 5 stars on my experience. I look forward to trying their dim sum carts on a weekend and hope my experience holds up. Even if it doesn't I think you can't go amiss with those specific dishes.",0O2ntQe3skmie9EOEy783Q,1,1,5,6uV69HWLFa9ssZTsPml1AA

Since I owed my dad a present from Father's Day, I let him decide on where he wanted to eat and we ended up here. We've been here numerous times before and it's how my dad developed an addiction to their chicken feet. Normally, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays it gets packed due to a lot of older Chinese folks dining here on those days( I was told those are their fave days off). But to my surprise, this place had plenty of seats available. We were seated promptly and the dim sum carts started coming by quickly. I ordered my folks some of their favorites:

Shumais- before becoming a pescetarian, these were one of my favorites. From what the folks and the bf said, it's still 'the same' and its still 'good'.
Pork buns- ok wtf I loved these so much that I accidentally took a bite out of one! Then I felt sick...NOT because it was bad it's bc I am not used to eating meat anymore. But from that small bite, it was still yummy! And everyone agreed.
Shrimp balls on a stick?- ok these were alright. Used to be better and the lady forgot the mayo. And what's up w/ the sugar cane..they should've left it out.
Beef balls- these are the bf 's fave...he said it was still 'good'
Chicken feet- i didn't have to ask my dad how it tasted. He devoured it in 2 seconds and had pieces of chicken skin hanging on his mustache..you decide.
Shrimp w/ crispy skin- ok I apologize for not knowing what the food is called in Chinese..anyway these are awesome.
Shrimp shumais- I love
Tofu dessert- Warm,not too sweet, and good!
Coconut bun- Eh..it's alright.
Mixed seafood shumais- Good flavor a must have.

The food overall is good. The service has improved a lot(then again it wasn't busy so it might change). The only thing I don't love here is that prices seem to change quite often and it doesn't show the prices on the ticket like it used to.

Those who loved the old Chang's won't be disappointed.  The dim sum remains quite good and a fantastic bargain.  The food is very authentic, and a welcome break from the typical Strip fare.

I noticed most of the customers again seemed to be native speaking Chinese...always a good sign for authenticity.  And I guess that's how I put the negative reviews in context.  If you have ever eaten authentic dim sum ANYWHERE in the world, and you actually are complaining that the push cart ladies don't speak English....grow up, man.  The ladies almost never do.  Use sign language, or Google images as I did, to get your point across.

The thing that struck me the most was the wonderfull service!  Our drinks were filled promptly upon becoming half empty.  They were constantly bringiing the carts around without being pushy.  Our friend ordered for us and I loved everything except the short ribs.  A little too shy on meat and flavor.  The chinese brocolli was divine.  He got us a desert that looked like an almond cookie on top but was shaped kind of like a cream puff.  It had a custard pudding inside that was very carmely!  Awesome.  Will go again when our friend takes us or if we get the nerve to try and order ourselves.,-YgKh-vSmcTp2FtlEdI2xQ,0,0,4,IdsUx55kKWr9so7JnAm-Fw
674054,2009-06-07,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Well, had lunch here Sunday, and it was fine.  I think the offerings from one dim sum restaurant to the next are generally the same (har gow, siu mai, pai gut, fung zao, et al), with the probability of the cooks in the back wanting to make a dish other restaurants don't have, which is a good thing for competition.

I got in around 10:45-ish and was immediately seated, asked what beverage(s) I wanted and started to order away.  I notice the siu mai skin was thinner here than at Harbor Palace; for me that's neither good nor bad, just a difference.  The one thing I should have ordered but didn't was the you tiao (""Chinese doughnuts"") that are served with jook.  It's, what, a foot of dough fried until golden brown and delicious?  I wasn't getting any jook, and I haven't had you tiao for ages.  At least I know where I can get some quick, since I live down the road from them.

I like the ambiance/feel of the place; it's a more subdued feel, and more ""modern,"" as opposed to HP, which I know has been in operation since at least 2002, when I first went there.  (Not to bash anyone, but in time the luster and sheen of Chang's will fade, too.)  I guess the owners wanted that pavilion vibe, which I can totally dig.  Unfortunately, the windows look out onto the parking lot outside; but, I still give them credit.  And, it was good to see that not only were the typical Asians there, but also whites and blacks, which always helps demystifying the culture.

I'm going to give Chang's the same rating as HP, because I feel the food and service were equally the same.  Chang's is a good place that's not too far from the Strip and serving the locals.",hHhSmytOPwOfbsIPQrbtzg,0,0,4,bEmT3sf3fHWy0VACQTPWmg

I thought I would remember the street so we drove around for a while and gave up.  I decided to give a call to my pop.  He would know!  He asked his lady where the best DS place is and her prompt response was ""Changs on Trop and Decatur"".  

Side note: She knows what she is talking about a) she is full Asian (I am only .5) b)she is a host to Asian hi-rollas and c)she used to live here and has good taste in food.

So imagine our surprise when we drove up to Changs and it was the place we had been before!  Yesss!!  There was no wait (it was about 2:30 pm) so we got seated immediately.  We had delicious shu mai, har gow, sticky rice, cha seu bao,  shrimp in the long white noodle (rolled up and cut with scissors), the sticky rice in banana leaves and I got a hankering for jook  and it did not disappoint!

I keep wanting to get the satay hot sauce, and asked several ladies pushing the carts, they keep telling me "" ask the waitress."" I haven't seen a waitress pass for any request. when I finally raised my voice to get the attention of a waitress, she said we only have 1 type of hot sauce. 
NOT REAL AUTHENTIC dim sum, if they do not have the satay hot sauce. 

The fried shrimp balls was OK, a bit dry. The steam rice noodle with beef on the inside, was weird. Noodles too chewy, and the beef seems like it was from some kind of beef paste, (its and Asian thing) 

I did like the siu-mai though, it was good. seems like it was steam with little fish eggs on top. 

I got my check, they actually charge $.50 for tea for each person. That was why the waitress keep wanting me to say yes for tea. Forget the $ amount, it's the principles of the matter.

775511,2009-08-10,1,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Did you ever want to try a new restaurant that was rated pretty well and found out that you should whip out the ol' Blackberry and log onto the site just to heave the thing across the room in the hopes of watching the communicative device shatter into a glorious spectacle of plastic and debris? Well this was the case in the following review I'm about to ""drop"" on you! 

The wife read about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine that a ""Yelper"" had reviewed. We were planning a trip to Vegas and figured that we would try something different, as opposed to the usual buffets that we would normally head straight for. Innocently enough, we made a B-Line straight to Chang's once we arrived in Vegas and was anticipating a decent Dim Sum experience. Once we got there, we were left standing in the Foyer for a few minutes. During this time, I noticed that one of the servers arrived late from behind us and hadn't had the chance to clock in before she sat us. I just found that kinda funny and thought I would share this with you! =) 

As the Brunch progressed, the wife got really tiffed because the best Chinese team, in terms of timing and follow-through, in the Dim Sum industry decided that they would all take the day off and allow the lack-luster, slow, and incompetent crew work a solid day. Whoa is me! 

Service was slow, our tea order was really late, the food was sub-par, and most of all, my hot chili sauce was late! I loves me some hot chili sauce with my Dim Sum dumplins!

I think that the highlight of our experience was when my wife finally threw in the towel and flagged down a Chinese lady and berated her with God knows what! I couldn't tell you what she said but service surely improved from that point on! God I love feisty Chinese women! 

The Dim Sum itself was not memorable and the chicken feet were like the worst things because it tasted breaded before braising.  It felt and tasted gummy.  

The prices were great and its location was easy to find! It wasn't tucked in the corner of some sleezy shopping plaza that may be impossible to get into or out--to! 

The final note from me is that, all in all, I will not go out of my way to come back here. I think the only way I would is if a friend clocked me over the head with a baseball bat (preferably metal..my head might shatter a wooden one then I'll be left cleaning the bits of splintered wood from the carpet with a headache! Who wants that?!) and bribe the paramedics to drop us off here rather than the Hospital. Maybe this way I wouldn't mind the mediocre tasting food, but I'd probably bleed out before I get my chili sauce! =(",L5T-zQCGAqUDW8v7z6Gdxg,1,1,1,ecM9Lb65WdtR2gIAHQQULg

The flavors were so odd.. mostly everyone took a bite of each thing and passed it on to the next person. It was a fun experience with all the friends but as far as the food, I'd put this in as a never again, no way, and horrible.I have always loved Chinese food but this was just terrible. It came to 25 bucks apiece and I was so hungry after that I had to come home and eat. Didn't help that when we watched the news later we saw this place on Dirty Dining.",Nii-gfMpE7EaOyFdkwU6bw,0,0,1,DK_0drZAdFE2h_v_fqK_ww

Ok, this isn't SF or NYC or Richmond/Vancouver, so because I wasn't expecting perfection, I found the food to be quite good.

Everything was hot and tasty. The steamed chive shrimp dumplings were my fave, didn't stick at all to the bottom. Also had an interesting tofu skin stuffed with pork, and couldn't leave without sesame balls. Love bean paste...

Great loose tea, not the bitter bag stuff.

AND it's totally cheap. *bonus*~

Dim Sum - Chinese Breakfast, Lunch, Brunch

I grew up with the Dim Sum push carts, so I love how they've kept this up so items arrive super hot versus having waiters/waitresses carrying them on lame trays getting cold.  Push carts are very helpful if you're a newbie at Dim Sum because the ladies will always show you what they have, just point and say Ok!

BBQ Pork Steamed/Baked Bun, Char Siu Bao, Baked Char Siu Bao - must get
Chicken Feet with Black Bean, Fung-Tzow - it's red
Spareribs in Black Bean - it's a bit oily
Steamed Open-Faced Pork and Shrimp Dumplings, Siu Mai - usually a crowd pleaser
Shrimp Dumplings, Ha Gow - lots of shrimp wrapped in a semi-clear skin
Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings, Xiao Long Bao - tasty, sometimes a bit mooshy
Chinese Turnip/Radish Cakes, steamed then pan-fried, Lo Bak Goh - my favorite
Steamed Glutinous Rice with Chicken, Shittake Mushrooms, and Chinese Sausage,
     wrapped in leaf, Lo Mai Gai - one of the best
Rice Noodle Rolls with Shrimp, Cheong Fun - best eaten fresh and with soy sauce
Thousand Yr Old Egg Congee, Pai Dan Jok - silky goodness
Beef Inards Stew, Gnaw Lam - one of my favorites, very tasty, relative to the menudo
Steamed Brown Sugar Cake (sometimes with almonds), Ma Lai Goh - very very good
Tofu Pudding with Ginger Sugar Syrup, Dao Fu Fah - silky goodness x2
HK-Style Fried Soy Sauce Egg Noodles, See Yau Wong - oodles of noodles

This is an extensive list of what's usually at my table, but it's not all of it.  Although I'm not a huge fan of trying ""new"" items, by all means Try EVERYTHING! (you won't know what you like until you try it, it's not like they bite)

Also, I don't recommend people recovering from hangovers to come here during Dim Sum hours, the noise level is very loud and they don't serve coffee.  (Coffee makes Dim Sum tastes yucky!)",sPksYz22qDXP2Zh475Pi1g,4,3,4,fQX2oGBlELoDZfKhM1UgwA

With most dishes at $2 or $2.75 it is really hard to have a bill over $30 for 2 people. How freaking amazing is that?! Especially after a drunken night, what better way to erase that hangover than with some ha gow, su mai, and hot jasmine tea?

Dishes that I didn't like:
 -congee (rice porridge): it was too thin and wasn't enough thousand year old eggs chunks :(
  -chicken feet: I've had better. I noticed a pool of clear fat in the dish. Haha :(

Loved the su mai, ha gow, shrimp balls, and the FRIED TARO. Get it. It was some crazy transitioning with the crispiness, and then soft taro, and then cloud 9!!! 

Also try the pineapple cream pastry. I have no idea what they call it but I included a picture. Looks like a mushroom. Came out HOT and DRIPPING with the egg yolk cream inside. Mmmmmmhhh!!!

5 stars for such great prices (our bill was $21!!!! And we are fat pigs too!!) and pretty good food! Thank you for existing, Chang's.",Dc43j8jCChaPZq8o3L5jQw,1,0,5,caOdhM1zQrTa3Dua3lfxeQ

By choice.  We asked if the a.c. was broken.  Nope.  Not broken -- nonexistent, they said.  Although, since no one there really speaks English, it's possible they have it but simply choose not to use it.  

We went there to eat in December and it was 49 degrees outside. 

But, inside this restaurant it was easily over 80 degrees from all the people and the heat from the kitchen.  The few ceiling fans only pushed the hot air around.

So, if you have low tolerance for heat and stifling stuffiness, avoid this place.

Service was the same as any other dimsum places.  Some are rude and some are nice... but at a dimsum place like this, you are not really paying for the service so you kinda have to let that go.

They pretty much had everything I wanted from sticky rice, shumai, spare ribs, that fried taro thing, tripe, congee, eggrolls you name it.  Their boba tasted pretty nasty tho... so don't get boba there.

I've heard a lot of up-and-down things about this place over the past several years, and I think that's what made me resistant to trying this spot out. After coming here, I would say it's a very solid spot for some dim sum.

After walking in, there is a fairly large dining room that is well kept and preserved. It's somewhat elegant in a way. The cart pushers seem to have a very good handle on the situation, constantly refilling and making sure the peeps are always getting what they need, and that is really important.

Onto the food. I liked everything, while I've been to places that do certain things better, I was really happy with what was received. No complains whatsoever. The food here is solid all around. But, the prices might be hard to beat here. Every time I go to KJ's at the Rio, I end up spending around 25 dollars for the food, whereas at Chang's, I believe I had gotten more food here than at KJ's, but I only spent 15 dollars.

Pros

Service: the only thing that was favorable during my early morning dim sum run was the service. They were polite and quick when it came to takings orders. Although some of the ladies with the carts can skip your table. 

Cons

Siu Mai & Har Gow: These are the basics for serving dim sum and it was such a let down. The fillings tasted bad and not enough shrimp was used. The har gow was the worst since the filling wasn't true to its original recipe. 

Fried Shrimp Dumpling: It was more like shrimp wontons since it was so tiny. There was more skin than the actual filling so all I could taste was the fried wonton wrapper. 

Chicken Feet: By far the worst tasting chicken feet, even the Chinese fast food places makes a better version.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,5,6,2,YKv1tjWwfofB5M9VIYMufw

My husband (1/2 Chinese 1/2 Swedish) and I (100% Chinese) came here with our son (1 year old) for an early dim sum lunch. We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.

When we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans. This in itself is racial discrimination/profiling, seriously who doesn't know how to use chop sticks?!?!? Do Japanese restaurants bring ""Americans"" forks? Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks? 

When it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it. At this point my husband walked over to her and tapped her on the back to give her the bill. She continued to ignore him and refused to turn around. He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.

When we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back. Uuuuummm really? How else am I supposed to get a workers attention so they can DO THEIR JOB? Instead of being apologetic or recognizing the blatant discrimination the owner and the manager of the restaurant blamed us the customers for being a problem.

The dim sum selection was not as extensive and pretty much average in taste. The fried shrimp ball was an exception. It was very tasty and not greasy at all. The steamed spare ribs (paired with some bits of squash) was also a pleasant surprise. The coconut milk taro cake had a faint coconut flavor which I liked. The cake does not resemble a cake. It reminds me more of a silky tofu.

I haven't tried too many dim sum places in Vegas so I don't have a baseline to compare it to. The selections I had from the dim sum menu were decent. I left very satisfied and I would come back to try their a la carte menu as well.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,7,7,4,Q1zuDFNg26UoXfpdRu_YiQ

Beef Tripe: This was tender and juicy. Pretty good.

Chicken Feet: This wasn't as tender as I'm used to but this was pretty good. They might need to cook this a bit longer.

Sticky Rice: The sticky rice was cooked a bit too long that the rice was slightly soggy but I liked the filling. It had variety of different meats.

Congee: Consistency is ok but they don't have enough pork or thousand year old egg in it. Pretty good.

Chinese Donut: I like how they make this one at a time so that any person who wants it, gets it fresh. It was crispy and warm. After giving it to us, they went back to the kitchen to get another one. That's good that they do that so that people get it fresh.

Pineapple Bun: I don't care for the bun because it's the same bun as they use for the bbq pork sweet bun. The filling is ok but not the best.

Spring Roll: The meat inside the spring roll was slightly mushy but the spring roll was really crispy.

Egg Tart: This was good too. It came out warm and the custard part was flaky.

Shrimp Dumpling: This is a good dish. The skin wasn't thick and it's not a large dumpling. 

Bean Curd Roll: This dish needs a good sauce. This was pretty good and the filling was tender.

Service was good. There's a lot of people pushing carts around and they also make sure you get the freshest dishes. There's also people picking up dishes too when you're done so you have space to get more food.

Some of the better items we tried here were the fried smelt, the pork buns, and the various dumplings.

I don't know whether they are short staffed or just have slow staff??? Service took forever just for hot tea & water (I kept asking when it should have been automatic when you sat down), when another one finally brought those after just a minute difference of delivering to our table by another person...she seemed so pissed!  Unbelievable!!! Can't even believe her facial reaction!

The table next to us were also waiting for a long time (10 mins since we got there) just for the to-go containers for their leftovers & their check.  And I thought it was just us...HA!

They are short of carts...while other dim sum places have double amount of carts servicing the floor to avoid the wait, they need to double up their service carts.  You will have consumed almost all of your food before you get to see the next cart (even if you have at least 4 short orders to feast on, providing you are a party of 2).

Service here is pretty typical of a Dim Sum restaurant. I wish they would come back to my table more frequently to fill me up with my favorite seafood and dessert dishes. So, because I have to wait for specific carts, I usually stay here longer than I would like to fill up on the items I adore.

Just came here again after usual dim sum hours. The place was a ghost town. After my last experience, I can definitely understand why.

I came here with my girlfriend's family and we were the only party there. To put it mildly, our party wouldn't be one a waiter would like to deal with. HOWEVER! It is still a waiter's duty to satisfy the customer! The moment my girlfriend and I arrived, her family was already there with her little 10 year old sister crying because she wanted to eat KFC for her birthday. Rather than alleviating the situation into something funny, the ONLY waiter working just kept giving our table glares. We were then given menus to write what we would like to have ordered.

I understand in regular dim sum you would receive your food whenever the carts get to you; however, if you I am ordering all at once for someone in the kitchen to make it, I hardly understand why my food would come out in 5 minute spans of each other. I found that strange and bad pacing of my meal. Our food was coming out slow, so I asked the waiter if our baked BBQ pork buns were still coming out. He then rudely claimed that he told us that he had no pork buns. In an ideal world, the waiter should have simply said ""sorry, we have no pork buns today"" and if I were to argue with him, then he could've justified acting defensive. Either way, he still didn't say that they were out of pork buns, but I digress... 

The experience then went sour when little sister dropped her glass and then future-mom-in-law drops her glass. The waiter completely avoids the situation cleaning other tables from afar. He never once came to our table and say ""don't worry, we'll take care of that."" These guys then lost their tip when the cashier said ""boy, your party sure was loud"" as we were paying for our meal. I understand that my party wasn't the best behaved at this meal; however, the guys working the later afternoon shift (after 3PM) need to learn customer service!

However the food was good, so we still left a 5% tip. -5% for bad service and -5% for bad management. I definitely have to come here one more time during normal dim sum hours to get a more accurate review.

In contrary to my last review my new dim sum places are now:
1. Cathay House (service improved)
2. Chang's (service seemed to have worsened during after hours)

chow mein thin noodles - really good, not too salty a simple dish but cool, not warm
barbecue pork - juicy, good charred meat and tender inside
meat balls - kind of rubbery, decent not great
rice cake (plus two orders to go) - awesome if you like this dish, sweet and subtle taste, soft marshmallow texture
mango mochi cake - our favorite item, with fresh mini piece of sliced mangoes, mango pudding inside mochi and topped with shredded coconut
sesame do-nut balls - really good, sweet with ample sesame seeds, really crunchy when warm

So we finished about 2/3 the order, and the waitress gave us boxes. She brings out the check. $38 before tip for all that. When she saw I was filling in the tip box, she started her smiling, and engaged in some small talk with us. ""Do you want water?  Do you want more tea?  Anything else? LOL, she has great timing..

The selection is pretty good, and everything was the right temperature, the hot things were hot, and the cold were cold (which is really important to me).

1921738,2015-07-12,1,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"I'm a skeptic of any sort of Asian food that isn't found in California, but sometimes, when you have a craving for dim-sum, you gotta make do with what you have. 

Kidding, the dim-sum here actually isn't that bad. While I wouldn't call this place amazing by any means, it's probably comparable to a lot of the average places you'll find in Los Angeles. My friends and I ordered all the standard dishes (???????????, etc.) and they all came out pretty solid. No complaints from me on that front! 

I also ordered some takeout to bring back for my fiance, who wasn't able to make it but nonetheless still wanted dim-sum. Here's the only part of this entire meal that bothered me. I flagged down a waiter so that I could get a separate take-out order, and he was probably the most inexperienced and unhelpful server I could have found at this restaurant. He couldn't speak any Mandarin or Cantonese, so I had some difficulty describing what I wanted since I usually don't think of dim-sum dishes in English. Then, when I figured out what the English names of the dishes I wanted were called, he told me that he was going to have to get someone else because I had ""too many orders for him to remember."" Gee, I didn't realize four items would be that hard to remember, especially when they were all staple dim-sum foods. 

I ended up going to the cashier counter to make my order. This time, placing my order was super easy because the lady understood Chinese, but it somehow took them 20 minutes to gather the four things I wanted. I highly doubt that they were waiting on anything to be cooked, because I saw multiple carts come by with exactly what I had ordered. Ugh. Annoying.

Overall still a fun excursion, but there's a lot that could've been done better, especially regarding their service. I usually cut Asian restaurants some slack about service because it tends not to be that great, but there are some things that are just too ridiculous to overlook.",xxGO2bwU02mip8W_lYjtYA,1,1,3,7mt_Yhixyx-V6DEuL5AM1g

Anyhow I came here for the prices first but being that it's been here for so long I figured the food had to be great. Well I was wrong. Don't get me wrong the Dim Sum was not horrible I just would rather go somewhere else where you will get better food for penny's more. 

The Resturant is typical Chinese dim sum set up and even with dated evidence in certain areas of the place it wasn't too bad. The service...well our server didn't seem like he wanted to be there at all or maybe that was just his un-personable personality but other then that everyone else was not bad friendly ""enough"" I guess. 

The thing I did like about this place though is that they had lots of variety, I'm mean that alone made me so happy like they had tons of options. So to me I thought that was satisfying because no one likes to go to a dim sum restaurant and see 3 carts coming out to your table with the same 4 items over and over right? Right! 

The food had ok flavors just some stuff didn't taste the same as you would expect it to at very other restaurant and not in a good way, like the green onions and shrimp dumpling. For example every dim sum you go to you know it will have a crispy pan fried wrap outside with a FRESH green onion crunchy flavor inside and juicy shrimp meat stuffing right? But no here it was a weird meatball with slimy green onion inside, not bad but weird. Their crispy fried crab dumpling also ok but not enough flavors and that to me would be my ultimate rating is that on a some of their suppose to be key item dim sum dishes just wasn't and mostly lacked in flavor and tasted different. Other than that the sticky rice wrapped in leaves was ok again not enough flavors. We order the calamari and fried rice from the kitchen (which does not open till like 11:30am) so if you go early don't expect to be able to order rice or anything from the kitchen. But when we did get those items the calamari was a skip but the fried rice was actually really freaking good. Their crispy taro was good and their BBQ pork pie was really good to name a few and OMG you have to try their Custard puffy pie thing for dessert. This item alone my friend will keep my business. It was the best thing I have ever tasted and I will continue to come back just for this of not anything else! 

So if you want to try it try it. Just know that you well experience a little of everything because they have great selection. The food is a hit and miss and the service is not 5 stars but what do you expect. The prices are a little bit better then most places but then again the food at other places are worth the extra pennies and they do have some items that is really good. I will not run back to try their not dim sum menu but I will definitely run back for their Custard cream puff pies!!!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,1,1,3,6nk-VuoViA2mQzzQRU3jZg

There was plenty of variety and everything was very affordable. The food was traditional Hong Kong style dim sum. They didn't try too many fusion dishes or try to put anything not usually served at dim sum. It was nothing innovative, but still very good. The usual caveats of Chinese restaurant apply. Most of the tables are big. Our group of 4 got sat at a table that could have easily sat 8-10. Also, your hot tea will always be refilled, but good luck getting ice water.

I went back again with relatives a few weeks later. It was not as great of an experience. I think part of it was because we arrived too early. The carts all had the same items.

Fast forward at least ten years later and I'm glad to see Chang's is still around (now with two branches) and that their quality is still up to par. 

The majority of diners go to Chang's for traditional Hong Kong style dim sum.  However, for our meal, we came for dinner and ordered a traditional Chinese banquet.  

Having eaten in Hong Kong, Vancouver, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, I admit I wasn't expecting much.  But after dinner, I came away quite happy and thought the meal was a fantastic deal as well.

Service was surprisingly good and it's a surprise this place was relatively quiet of patrons.  It may be off the strip, but I can guarantee the Chinese food is better than most offerings on the Strip and of much higher and authentic quality.  Two thumbs up.

A sampling of our menu:

Appetizer plate - a beautiful presentation of Chinese BBQ items like duck and goose, alongside sliced meat selections, jellyfish, shrimp and seaweed.  Everything was flavorful and really started the menu off right.

Crab claws - Deep fried crab claws fresh out of the fryer were hot and delicious and was served alongside what looked like deep fried seaweed.  The waiter later informed us it was the top part of the gai lan Chinese vegetable deep fried and seasoned with salt.  Unique and delicious.  No one wanted the waiter to take it away.

Shark Fin Soup - classic presentation with good flavor and plentiful pieces of Virginia ham and chicken to complement the fin.

Peking Duck - a whole prepared duck was brought out, skinned, and served to each patron in a bun.  They then sliced the excellent duck meat and served that as a platter as well.

Braised Abalone with Chinese Vegetables - the abalone was not the least bit overdone and the vegetables were top notch

Steamed fish - I believe a whole rock cod was prepared steamed with ginger and soy sauce.  Live and fresh.

Wok fried lobster - a large lobster cut into pieces and sauteed with ginger and scallions.

E-fu noodles - a wonderful side dish alongside the fried rice.

Fried rice - standard fried rice

Overall, we were extremely pleased with Chang's.  Service was polite and fast, entrees were delicious and plentiful, and prices were very competitive.  We all left with more leftovers than we knew what to do with and everyone had plenty of their favorite dishes.

Next time you're in Vegas craving authentic Chinese food, you deserve to give this place (or it's sister branch) a try.

2333595,2013-12-28,3,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"(3.4 star) In Las Vegas when you think about dim sum you think about Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine, well Chang's and maybe 2 or 3 other places. It is a popular place for dim sum and has been around for years. Chang's was actually my first real dim sum experience, sure I've had the various dim sum items before but I never eaten in the ""dim sum"" environment where an old little Asian lady goes around pushing her cart offering food served from steamer containers until Chang's.

Nothing I've had wowed me to point of shouting ""OH THIS IS THIS BEST THING EVER!"" but majority of what I've had were delicious with some meh items. They have all of my favorites. You have to either like or dislike dim sum to eat at a dim sum place and I'm in the middle. I like eating dim sum items but don't like eating at time dim sum places. I'll eat or try almost everything they have to offer except the weird stuff. It's kind of hard to keep track of what you've eaten until the end because they'll come around fast with multiple carts and containers, they'll show you various items, and you just say that you want it or not. It's easy to get carried away. There will be containers on the table and you won't remember what they are, surprise.

Overall I don't think it's the best ""dim sum"" experience you can have in Vegas but I'll probably be back just for the food. It's spacious but can fill up, reasonably priced but can really add up if you want to eat a lot, clean but not so clean, it's old and does look like it needs work.

I've poked around Yelp and other ratings websites, and every now and then I see a review that decries that the restaurant that they are covering has the ""best"" dim-sum. Of course not everyone agrees as to where the best dim sum is, but they probably agree to what it is.

If you are familiar with dim sum, you may want to read their reviews instead.  If, like me, you had to go to wikipedia to figure out what dim sum is, then this is the review for you.

First - Dim Sum isn't on the menu.  In fact, there is no menu.  You are seated and given a blank card, with seperate price points.  I have eaten at a conveyor-belt-sushi place before, so I recognised this as meaning some dishes cost more than others.  Since the highest price point was about $4 I felt pretty safe.

Almost immediately, a server rolls up a cart of food.  Most of it is covered. With a bizzare amount of excitement they remove a lid and say something.  I presume they described the dish, but 
1) English is a second language at Changs
2) I'm not good at decyphering accents
3) It is very noisy in here
4) I wouldn't know the difference between fan gwo and yung bau

They keep uncovering dishes, like they are working on commission or something.  You know those movies where you see the busy marketplace in China or Persia and everyone is trying to push their wares?  That's what the servers are like.  It's not high pressure though.  Say no and they shove onto the next table to try to make a sale. 

I say yes to a couple of items. Chicken feet look like chicken feet, so I  stayed clear of them.  What I got was a total mystery though.  One was like a wonton soup, without the soup.  The other was like slices of sausage on a bed of carrots and cabbage.  I wish I had taken photos so someone could help me figure out what I ate.  It was pretty good though.

The server stamps my card with a little stamp.  Joy! I hit two of the lower price items.

Looking around, I see that in this packed restaurant, we are the only table without someone of Asian heritage sitting at it.  I wondered if it would be innapropriate to ""borrow"" someone else's Chinaman for lunch.  Most of the tables had more than their fair share.  Then I have a plan.  Just watch what other people are getting, then when something that looks the same comes my way, I'll get that.

My new plan gets me a tasty gooey rice wrapped in a big leaf.  This is very good.  Our card gets stamped with a different color stamp (maybe they do work for commision) and we hit the $4 item.  We are getting full, and I see someone get a plate of sesame seed covered balls, and put them directly into a to-go box.  I figure it must be a dessert that is so good, people get them even when they are stuffed.  The cart comes by and boom - I point and they deliver.  It may be uncouth, but if nobody explains proper custom, then I will make up my own.

The sesame balls are tasty dough balls with a sweet purple filling.  I will call them Chinese doughnuts.  Not as sweet as a regular doughnut, I could sit down with a dozen of these and a cup of coffee every morning.  Thanks ""to-go box family"" for the tip!

To sum up dim sum:  It was good when I was just guessing.  It was better when I was spying on others.  Maybe next time I will bring binoculars. I never felt out of place, even though I clearly was, so kudos to the staff there.  If you are ready for an adventure, I would reccommend Changs.  I'm unqualified to say it's the best, but for a good -and different- lunch for two under $22, it's worth trying.",cMAiTrM0Fxm8vKLQag53jg,3,1,4,TInqdv34aUB4WCED7ilLuQ

We came in around 3:30pm on a Saturday. After we were seated, the manager/server handed us a double sided piece of paper with the dim sum and prices listed - we just marked off on the sheet what we wanted, then we handed it back to our server and they began making it in the kitchen.

The food was inconsistent compared to our last visit - Items that I didn't care for, were actually good this time around and vice versa.

My Favorites:
- Juicy fried shrimp balls with sweet mayo are consistently delicious, plump, and flavorful.
- Fluffy (white) steamed BBQ pork buns were moist, freshly steamed, and stuffed generously with flavorful BBQ pork - They weren't soggy like our first visit. We also took 2 orders to-go and they were still delicious the next day!)
- Har Gow wasn't incredible, they were slightly hardened/dry but they were decently flavored.
- Sui Mai were moist, plump and satisfying.

I'll Pass: 
- Dry and minimal filling in the (glazed) baked BBQ pork buns. It was practically all bread and no BBQ pork. 
- Tiny and dried out egg custard tarts.
- Sloppy and breaking apart cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) with 2 tiny shrimp per noodle. The flavor was average, but the noodles were chunky and dense. 

Chang's is not a terrible option for dim sum, plus they serve dim sum all day so that's always a plus! However, if it's before 3pm I'll still recommend KJ dim sum for the most satisfying dim sum. That's my spot! 




Previous 2 star review:
--------------------------
I've concluded that KJ Dim Sum still holds the throne for the best dim sum. I mean, don't get me wrong, there were some items from Chang's that were legit and done very well, but there were more fails than wins. 

My favorites:
- Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumplings) - this was amazing the first round, delicate and lightly sweet, but the second round was lacking a lot of flavor and not as tender. 
- Cheong Fun (Rice Noodle Rolls) with Shrimp - lovely pillowy soft noodle texture, but 2 miniature shrimps in each roll.  
- Fried Shrimp Balls served with sweet mayo. This was our absolute favorite, the shrimp balls were super moist inside and flavorful.

I'll pass:
- Pork Sui Mai - This classic was shamefully bland and unmemorable.
- Steamed BBQ Pork Buns - they were on the mushy soggy end. The minimal BBQ pork filling wasn't bad, but it's also not the best either. 
- Chicken Feet - good flavor, but fatty and I couldn't get past how oily it was.
- Fried Taro Puffs stuffed with pork - It had a nice pillowy taro texture, but it was extra soggy on the bottom from being soaked in oil.

We came here on a Sunday at about 3pm and even though they advertised that Dim Sum is served all day, we were having a difficult time ordering it. Only one lady came out with a cart when we sat down. After we grabbed a couple items from her cart, they all bounced and started their lunch - so no one served us for the rest of our meal. There were no carts to be seen. We wanted to order more, but no one came to check on us.

We finally got the manager to serve us since he was the only one not on his lunch break. He seemed a little agitated that we wanted to order more. Not to mention, they ran out of a couple items that we wanted to order.

Pro Tip: come during prime breakfast and brunch hours- any time after that the service and food will be nonexistent. 

The restaurant didn't give off a clean vibe. The bathrooms are super sketchy, old, sticky, and scary. It makes me wonder what's the condition of the kitchen.

All of this made it a less than desirable dining experience. We will continue to enjoy the excellent service, pristine cleanliness, better prices, better selection at KJ Dim Sum. Plus KJ has the best egg custard tarts of my entire life! They're damn good.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,6,4,3,UkzI5hUFEt1JlM3I2vt5qA

The wait time at 11:30 was about 30 minutes long (not too bad) but the food was just okay. I felt like the rice wrapped in shrimp tastes a little bit artificial and the Shu Mai didn't have as much flavor as I though it would. 

There was about 5 ladies pushing the cart and I thought it was funny when people were running up to them and taking things off their cart instead of letting them walk by. The Chinese donut was extremely fried and almost as yellow as turmeric but my boyfriend said it was delicious. 

I think the service could have been better too as the ladies pushing the cart skipped our table and other tables next to us a few times. All in all, I think I will give it another shot before I make my final decision.

Here's what happened on my most recent experience at Chang's on a Tuesday just past the busy lunch hour:

* I sat for nearly 5 min with no server asking for water and hot tea or any of the dim sum carts around. Not a good sign. 
* The shrimp har gow and beef tripe tasted very bland with no flavor at all. Not at all what I expect from any dim sum place.
* Are you telling me at 1:00 on a Tuesday afternoon there are only 2 carts of dim sum available to choose from? Wow talk about lack of variety (and I pretty much lost my appetite after three dishes).
* I overheard an elderly couple at another table voicing their frustration at their server that they had placed an order for sesame balls for the last 15 min and never got it and that they need to go. The server apologized and expedited their order in a to-go container. Didn't know if the server charged the order or not for the couple but still an unpleasant situation to be in.

Unless the management take note and make change towards improving their customer service and appeal of their business, I will most likely not return (not even for a special offer or discount).",mFro0vmgVgZ-rZeE5MlpWg,3,0,2,SABetUznQGaibdanYED56A

Some servers were great, others weren't responsive at all (the congee cart specifically took more than 90 minutes and multiple requests to the other servers and hostess before we got our dishes. Needless to say, there were certain members of the party that really wanted congee...). I'd recommend sitting near the double happiness sign for best service as all the carts come out from there. 

They were constantly coming out with new freshly cooked hand made dishes. Our favorites included the shumai, pork ribblets, and the shrimp balls (fried and steamed). Only complaint food-wise was that a few of the other balls and shrimp dumplings had too much corn starch and not enough meat.

As dim sum should be relaxing and chill, we did not order everything at one go. Unfortunately for us, those carts went back in the kitchen and never came back out. They said that if we wanted anything special we'd have to order it. That's just not dim sum. Sorry, not the place for our usual Saturday hang-out with this kind usual chinese style rudeness. I'm Chinese, I can say this.

Okay, I have to be fair. This place is better in selection and quality than Orchid Gardens but it still doesn't compare to that of Great Eastern in SF. But, this is Vegas and I am not going to compare with other cities (Vancouver, HK, China, Sydney..etc).

It took us a while to find Chang's, and we ended up googling best dim sum place in Las Vegas, and Chang's was the first search result to display. We saw that it was less than 10 minutes away from our house, so we decided to check it out and give it a try. We were definitely not disappointed!

Normally, my biggest gripe about dim sum places is that the venues are normally huge dining hall areas, and the servers cart around the food forever and the food gets cold, and by the time we get it, it is no longer fresh. At Chang's the restaurant is small enough venue, so the food is ALWAYS fresh, especially if you get a table next to where the carts come out from the kitchen. 

I have a few recommendations for the best dim sum dishes. Definitely get the fried pork dumplings (ham shay go). This is my favorite dish there! It's less than $4 per order, which comes with 3 fried pork dumplings. I also really like the Chinese pan friend leek buns (gow choi). This is a less-widely known dish, but is equally amazing. Also less than $4 per order! Other recommendations include: salt and pepper shrimp or calamari, chinese broccoli, pork and shrimp siomai, and har gao (shrimp dumpling). If you stick with these items, you'll be set. I've gone for dinner before, and it isn't the best of Chinese restaurants, so make sure you just go for lunch dim sum, and don't bother with their regular menu items (this is the only reason I rate this place a 4-star versus a 5-star).

We love all of the dim sum items there, and we have dreams about them. No joke. It is one of the places that we always go back to visit when we travel to Las Vegas. Not too far away the strip if you are a tourist. Go where the locals go and don't get dim sum in the casinos. Trust me on this one.",9xppB_mrDBH3agQA8uLZOg,4,1,4,Xv8soYmpYFfKcC-WP0TUug

Their shumai and bao are delicious. Chicken feet, anyone? Yum! The carts are constantly going around and if a dish you request isn't on a cart, they'll usually inform you how many minutes before it gets back on. The ladies pushing the carts are pretty helpful. Some may speak hardly any English but they will try to explain to you, if you ask, what the dishes are. Keep the paper for food tally easily accessible to servers on your table. The ladies will come and stamp your food order on it and then you'll take it to the window by the entrance when you're done to pay for the meal. 

The food is relatively cheap and most orders are under $5 so I never had to ask how much each dish costs. Make sure to ask for large glasses of water or they will bring you tiny ones. They might come and check if you need a tea refill but if you happen to run out, just signal for more by turning over the tea pot lid or propping it ajar. This works some times.

No matter how much time goes by Chang's is always the same- same atmosphere, same friendly folks. One thing different this time was the quality of food, which I'm sorry to say has gone way down. Even the $2.99 price tag doesn't justify such flavorless dim sum ):

Out of 10 items ordered, the only thing good were the custard pineapple buns, and strangely, they were actually some of the best I've ever had. Fresh out the oven, crisp shell, LEGIT custard filling that's made from salted egg yolk. The hot runny custard is the best part, and there's so much that it runs down your hand with each bite! I can't recommend anyone coming here due to the lackluster food, but if you're desperate for dim sum and low on cash, I recommend you try those pineapple buns above anything else

Also want to note a weird thing about this place is that you walk up to a cashier window to pay for your meal. I've never seen a cashier window at a big dine in restaurant before and I felt like I buying movie tickets or something lol. But the guy working there was super fast and efficient though so props to that! I'd much rather walk up and pay than wait forever for someone to pick up my card.

I was very wary coming here because it was deserted. I actually thought they were closed the first time. The crazy part is that the dining room is pretty big but don't be surprised if you are the only one there. Normally this is a very bad sign that the restaurant is awful but I took my chances and I'm glad I did.

They have some off the wall plates and I was in a daring mood so I decided to try the Bird's Nest. Sounds crazy but it's just seafood and veggies in a chow-mein-ish bowl. The chow-mein/noodle is made into a dried cracker bowl and the seafood just sits inside it. Just in case this was a bust we ordered a ""safe"" dish in orange chicken.

The food was amazing. The Bird's Nest was very enjoyable and fun to eat! The bowl soaks in the seafood juicies and the crunchy bite into the chow-mein is so satisfying. The orange chicken tastes really good but not over the top with flavors. They give you a ton of rice + hot tea so I really enjoyed the service.

I don't know how they stay in business when they are empty all the time. I've been there three times now and the most I've seen is 1 table besides us.

Our go to dim sum spot is KJ Dim Sum in Rio.  We went there and it was packed and just nuts.  The wait was 1 hour for a table for 2.  No way.  I hit up my foodie friends and asked for fave dim sum spots.  Yum Cha seemed to be the popular dim sum spot in town, which I had bookmarked and wanted to try.  But I called and nobody answered the phone twice so I didn't feel like chancing it with a trip over there.  Chang's was another recommendation and I had never heard of this place so I immediately bookmarked it and called them, only a 15 minute wait for 2 guests.  So we headed that way.

When we arrived, the place was pretty packed, not KJ Dim Sum packed but still very busy.  We put our name on the wait list and they said 15 minutes.  She handed me a small piece of paper with ""E4"" on it. No problem.  20 minutes later, I check back in and the hostess told me it would be 15 minutes.  My response, ""You told me that 20 minutes ago.""  And then she said, ""I'm sorry, I don't know how much longer.""  The wait list system was chaotic, unorganized and just a big mess.  I put my name on the list at 11:45am.  When they FINALLY sat us, it was 12:20pm, 35 minutes instead of the estimated 15 minutes.

This gets better.  When they finally sat us down.  They put us at a table that was still dirty.  No joke.  But I was trying to be patient and keep a happy face for my kid who really wanted the Har Gow for lunch.  We were sitting at the table for 10 minutes and nobody stopped by the table to say hello or bus the table.  I had to flag down one of the ladies from the hostess stand, possibly the manager or owner and ask her to have someone come clean the table.  She was very apologetic and about 5 minutes later, she got the busboy to come over.  She again was very apologetic and I totally understand that it was nuts in there.  But at this point, I was already turned off with the underestimated wait time, being sat at a dirty table and nobody coming over to clean up the table until 15 minutes later?

We finally get a server.  Not a very good one.  He was obviously stressed out and inattentive.  I ordered Jasmine tea.  He brings over a tea pot and two tea cups.  Waited 5-10 minutes until a dim sum cart actually comes by.  We're starving and just want Har Gow and pork dumplings.  That cart finally arrives and we immediately get those items.  My kid is still hungry and I dread ordering anything else.  I waved down our server and just ordered another order of Har Gow instead of waiting forever for a dim sum cart to roll on by.  Also asked for the check so we could get out of there.

The restaurant space is confusing and not very efficient for dim sum carts!!!!  Too many nooks and crannies and not enough space for them to roll the carts around.  It was painful to watch.

Listen, granted it was Chinese New Year weekend and I realize it was a crazy day to come out for dim sum.  I get that.  But even so, I was not impressed from the start. The place is outdated and dirty. The service was terrible. The food was not worth the wait. Considering how long we ended up waiting here, we were better off waiting that hour at KJ Dim Sum. 

I feel as if they purposely quote you 15 min when it should have been 30-45 minutes because they don't want to lose your business. No thank you. The one thing I did like about Chang's, they offer free hot tea. But still won't get me back here.",7xwLiQx0-lCOXBUDAcazZA,10,2,2,jr8VxS_ZCcWFOeebSy32OA

I took two bites, and almost fainted , The other interesting thing is that 20 minutes after eating the two bites, i got a little sick.  to top it all off, the server was rude.

In an effort to enjoy all that the city has to offer, I found myself here at Chang's one recent weekend afternoon, with the hope of scoring something delicious. What I had found was what I expected all along: an average run of the mill ""yum cha"" experience.

It's not entirely their fault, after all Las Vegas isn't overrun with a Chinatown that isn't filled with seedy adult joints and gringofied Chinese spots without the support or demand of a larger community. Hence, the exterior gives away the experience ahead of time: a semi-cheesy palatial looking front coupled with a retro sign that screams Chinese Americana from decades before.

Inside the Dim Sum scene is within the typical banquet hall, with a few carts that make their rounds, usually a couple with steamed dishes and the others with more fried pastries and desserts. Once we saw the same 4 carts that approached the table and very few staffers with special dishes to give out, the experience and variety is going to be limited.

Everything from the steamed to the fried was bland. My beloved shrimp dumplings (har gow) needed some serious hot sauce before I could rip them from their mini bamboo baskets, even when the rice shell is dry and falling apart. The same could be applied to the fried pork dumplings (ham sui gok), which all of its glutinous glory was puffy and thick, but unfortunately was lacking on the pork part, skimpified on the guts side. All of the rice noodle wraps / crepes (cheurng fun) all needed some sweet soy sauce help before consumption, though the same can be said about the lo mai gai, siu mai, and fish + meat ball (ngau yuk yuen / lang yu kau).

A surprisingly decent dish? The stir fried rice noodle with sesame seed. Soaked in soy sauce, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seed and peppers, it was surprisingly flavorful and light. It was fragrant and the texture was silky smooth. It piques my curiosity for their other non-cart noodle dishes.

3294127,2010-10-11,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"In my humble opinion, Chang's is probably pretty authentic whether you roll for lunch, dinner or dim sum.  It is definitely superior to the Strip offerings in term of value.  If you're from East LA, then you might find something to complain about like shu mai being $2 instead of $1.50.

Sunday at 11:30am, dim sum wait time = 15 minutes.  By the time we left, it probably pushed up to 30 minutes.  Most people are in and out of there fairly quickly.

Service-wise, I think that Chang's is slightly understaffed, particularly in the non-cart personnel for water / tea refills and bill settlement.  The workers look a little tired, so I would bet that this has been the case for a while and they probably don't plan on staffing up.

Another minor note is that the cart ladies are not very keen on doing the visual style of ordering.  That is, more laid back places will show you each dish they are offering up, especially if you are clearly not Chinese.   It was very handy that I knew at least my favorite dish names and that they could understand my non-Chinese accent.  I am sure that it hurt their ears, but I got what I wanted.  Hargow, cha sau bau, jiao-tsu, etc (damn, I forgot my Chinese romanization... and I am getting pinyin and wade-giles all mixed up).  I definitely recommend taking a native speaker or at least get your favorite dish names memorized.

Price-wise, it probably is more that the general price of food and restaurants going up, but I think that it is a bit on the higher side.

We selected most of the basic items that were rolling around. I think there were only 2 carts... 

Nothing about the dim sum sticks out to me, pretty average. I wish we would have came earlier for a better experience and greater selection.

I had called ahead asking what time they stopped serving, They supposedly stop serving dim sum around 3 so I guess late comers get what's left.

This place opens at 10:30am on the weekend. I was there for Dim Sum right when it opened. The food was great. A lot of the pastries like the Sesame Balls, Barbeque Pork Pies were fresh out of the oven and hot! Those were GREAT!!! Seriously I didn't realize the difference, but if I can make a comparison. Cookies fresh from the oven are WAY better than ones sitting around, so were the Sesame Balls. The Sui Mai was fresh too, but I think the chicken feet were a little over done. That was the only bad thing I have to say.

The Good:
Very close to the strip by taxi 
Walking distance from The Orleans Casino
Good Authentic Dim Sum
Inexpensive
Decent/Friendly Service (is that possible at Dim Sum?)

The Bad:
No taxi's readily in the area to get you back to the strip.
If you walk to The Orleans for a taxi the neighborhood gets a little slummy.",bvoR3u9-vQanpUq13zVypw,0,0,4,TBS64fmAst9duoStMVbKaw

3382530,2011-03-27,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Average foods and service. I enjoyed it. But their attitude sucked. Let me explain...

I've been there once and anxious to return for a second visit. Dim sum was meant to be eaten with friends. So I surrounded myself with friends each time.

We all agree the foods were good, ranging from American fried foods to steamed southern Chinese dumplings. There was nothing bad and nothing outstanding. The service was on par with most big dim sum places. So are the ambiance and restroom.

After we're done, we split the cost and paid the tips. The restaurant only accepted credit card for minimal $20. So we all paid cash to one that used CC. The waitress chased after the group asking for tips. Not just once, but twice.

There are 2 problems here. First, tipping is a gratitude. I decide how much to tip and not influenced by anyone else. If the wait staffs have lousy attitude, I don't tip and most likely I will not return regardless of the foods.

Second, if we left the tips on the table and they couldn't find it, who's at fault?

It's audacious to ask for tips once, being purely shameless. Twice? It's plain outrageous.

So diners, heed my warning... they were very proud of their wait service and they will let you know about it if you don't tip. Unfortunately the service was average and they expect instant reward.",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,0,0,3,ptPbrlx_37Z2SLfU7C6rZg

After being spoiled by eating at so many good dim sum places back home in Monterey park/Rowland area, Chang's felt subpar to me. For all my OC ppl visiting Vegas & thinkin about trying this place, I would say it's comparable to dragon phoenix in Bolsa. You have the ladies rollin the cart around, which I don't really prefer because the temperature of the items were barely warm

Surprisingly though, the servers were on top of it here. I don't really expect much service from a chinese restaurant, but our water cups were never empty and the manager was a really friendly guy. We later found out they speak cantonese here, and once again I was used as the person to order everything for the table because I was the only one that spoke cantonese -__-

The place looked really clean for a chinese restaurant and the prices weren't bad.  They had all the dim sum basics such as shu mai, har gow, chinese broccoli, chicken feet, etc. The dim sum items such as shu mai and har gow were a bit small though. The good thing is I don't think they load up on MSG here and the food wasn't too salty. The congee was a rip off though because there was barely any shredded dry pork in it and the fried donuts weren't like the ones back at home.The fried donuts to dip in the congee were too crispy and there was a lot of oil on the plate.

Not too bad of a place to grab dim sum in Vegas. My friend said it's a lot better than Ping Pong Pang's",u6Rb0yrjDvYpAFOgXL8WXQ,7,4,3,CunShhk6CjbtJ90-PnrGHA

The food was really good, particularly the fried shrimp balls, which is my favorite dim sum item.

We got too many items for me to list but overall, try as much food as you can because it was all tasty!

3620671,2013-08-27,5,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Been going here for years for dim sum and dinner. It's generally been one of the more decent places to go for chinese. Sadly, this era is long gone. 

I won't be going here again. 

You see, I've dined at MANY chinese spots from Los Angles' chinatown, Seattle, San Francisco, Orange County and just about any other major hub for chinese food, and, for the most part, have a tolerance for bad service, as, let's face it, the more authentic the cuisine, the more you can expect lousy service....and did I mention I'm half chinese? So trust me when I say I have built up a tolerance over the last 3 decades...

So yesterday, I attempted to place my pickup order, however, after 45 mins of quality telemarketing style dials, continuous ringing with no answer, I eventually gave up and decided to head down there to place it in person.

Thinking it was super busy, I walk in and there are only 3 tables being served in the entire restaurant! So I stand at the ""pay for your bill window"" for 10 mins....no one. After an even longer wait, a chubby balding guy wearing a white polo looks at me and walks past me, even after my attempts to stop him. Just flat out ignored me. Then a tall guy wearing a blue shirt, glasses and a bluetooth headset (obviously more for the ""look"" as clearly no one there answers phones) comes out. After being vocally forthcoming (pissed off) about the lack of attentiveness, being visibly upset, and emphasizing the need to pickup their phone (which he had no explanation for), he proceeds to take my order. Midway through writing it down, he notices someone ready to pay, so he abruptly interrupts me and says ""let me get him first"", and without my approval waves the customer ready to pay to front of the line! This after everything that has happened thus far in addition to expressing my frustration?!? As he's clearing the customer's bill he says ""I will get you next"". So with my patience all but spent, I wait....as he finishes up he walks out into the dining area and picks up a serving tray with sauces and as he's walking away says ""be right back and I will help you""......WHAT IS THIS GUY THINKING?!?! 

Realizing these people don't have a clue, I begin to walk out. As I'm about to get into my vehicle, he then starts chasing after me, yelling for me to come back. Now I have your attention? After being rudely ignored 3 times in a row? Too late. Unacceptable. 

To the owner of Changs: FIRE THESE INCOMPETENT MORONS! Your food is not worth the lack of respect these two idiots have demonstrated! Not only do I plan to never return, but you can be certain I have informed everyone I know, and everyone I will ever meet of this awful experience. The food, which is below average at best, is not worth the 

Fellow Yelpers: This place many years ago was decent, the service, quality of food and portions have all significantly declined. Sadly, you'll find better service, food and portions dining at Panda Express! Seriously. Don't bother with this place.

We ordered quite a few things, but certain ones were especially tasty.
BBQ Pork Bun, Baked. The Bun was big, but the breading was nice and thin, and crispy. Every note has BBQ Pork in it, which is wonderful. Most places have a super thick bread and barely any meat.
The Egg Tart was delicious! The Egg custard was creamy and not too sweet, very good consistency. The Tart Crust was flaky, crispy, and thin. Perfect size to finish to 2-3 bites.
Steam Rice Flour (Chang Funn), rolled nicely. Thin yet didn't break apart when we picked up with chopsticks. Chewy texture and no flour residue.

Growing up eating at Chinese restaurants, I really do expect to be treated badly - Cups not being refilled, no one to come check on you, 50 Chinese workers and all of them ignoring you when you need something, etc.  

We came here for dim sum on a Saturday afternoon and I think the food was good, but it doesn't taste any different than the other Chinese restaurants around the valley.  Workers strolling around with their carts, they show you the goods, yell out the name of the food, but you have no idea what they are saying, you point, they put it on your table, and they take your ticket and stamp it.  When you are done fast food eating style, you take your check, tally up the stamps and give you some dollar amount to pay.  I never check the amounts because I don't even know how much is each food item.  They do charge an  18% tip for parties of 6 or more which frankly is BS because they don't give you even a 5% tip worth of service.",pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg,0,0,3,1WEFCMotZS075Uc84JJqTw

I was reading one of  the Yelp reviews and it mentioned that they are the best Dim Sum west of the Mississippi, and they are!  I have visited so many dim sum in the East Coast and West Coast and even Hong Kong and I can say that this place is on the top of my list.

Every time my family and I are in Vegas we have to make a stop and eat at this place and really early.  I've heard about the wait, but have yet to experience it since we get there before they open.  Once we get seated I see the place gets filled up quickly within a matter of minutes.

It is your typically Dim Sum with carts going around, but what make it different is the freshness of the food and not too salty for my taste.  Even the dessert is not too sweet.  When I go there I usually get the steam buns, sweet tofu, congee and some chicken and vegetables. 
My kids love their egg rolls and the vanilla pudding.

And, the best is the price!  It is very reasonable and they have it displayed, not like other dim sum place where they have it in chinese!

First of all, this is not a place I would recommend if you are new to Dim Sum. There were just a few carts in a huge dining room, and they never came over to our table without us having to flag them down. They didn't give us any information about what was on the cart and answered a few questions pretty begrudgingly. If you're eating here and are pretty familiar with the standard Dim Sum dishes you would probably be fine, but as someone who didn't know what she was looking at it was very frustrating. 

The hostess in the front of the restaurant was very friendly and helpful, though, she helped a friend of ours get one of her favorite dishes that wasn't on any of the carts (they were either missing a lot of things because it was busy or they didn't have a wide variety of options to choose from). The parking was limited and crowded, as was the dining room. I've only visited on a busy weekend, but the dining room was very loud when we were there.

While the food we did get was good, the selection and service means we probably won't be back. I'm just not a fan of any restaurant where I leave hungry!",n-Hit0Y3O6FxTiEhdEEsZw,4,0,2,f4p5wNC3wvAlgQ_wwWjZWQ

3923724,2012-07-01,7,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"I went to this place my first day in Vegas cause I was hungry after my flight and was yearning for some Dim Sum...

The place was easy to find with GPS guidance. Chang's is located at the Southwest half of the city and looks like a new part of town since most of the buildings looked fairly new and not much traffic in the area.  The private parking lot is sufficient for all the patrons to park. Although I got there around lunch time and the place was bustling with patrons and workers I was seated very quickly.  The place is not that large and it appeared a lot of the Chinese community was there....and you know that could indicate...?  Traditional Chinese taste...and good... :-))  As soon as I sat down, the carts started swarming around the table...like a swarm of bees to their nest - very quick service with the delivery of the food and drinks.  One of the things I was impressed with at this place was that if you tried to select something off the cart that was not of proper  temperature, they wouldn't serve it but rather bring you a freshly cooked item from the kitchen...That I thought was very nice.  Additionally, I had gotten some fish and after tasting it, found it wasn't really something I liked so I told the manager my experience and he very nicely and without any further question or hesitation replaced it with another dish to my liking. Now that's service with a smile!!

Needless to say, I've found my favorite Chinese Dim Sum restaurant in Vegas! Btw, I came back for a second time that week as I was leaving Vegas?  

The best part is they serve Dim Sum All Day! :-D

And the final thing is this place is just far enough away from the strip to give you a more relaxed feeling from the fast pace.

I'll be back!!! Can't wait till my next visit...not the strip but for the Dim Sum!!

Happy eating!!

Thanks to Jaymie B., the local Yelper compass that helped me get my bearing right on Chang's.  :-))",D35Xvfnd2IMRskgDu03r8Q,9,9,4,1Xo6_F1J9V7WSM-JdugGag

3943292,2009-07-30,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Hmmm, this place is a little difficult for me to review to be honest. My wife and I were treated to this place by my father-in-law and his girlfriend, both of whom have had prior experience ordering dim sum. I expect this is why our experience was a bit more positive than some of the other reviews I've read on yelp. It does kind of help if you have an idea of what you are ordering ahead of time since many of the dishes taste different then they actually look.

We got there at exactly 10:30 and managed to get a table just fine, but fairly quickly the restaurant started to fill up with large families. I'm told that this is fairly usual here and that you should expect to wait for awhile if you get there much later than that. 

Ok, time for the food. I can't recall half the stuff we ended up ordering, but I do remember that many of the dumplings and buns went down really well with our group. The pork buns, shrimp dumplings, vegetable dumplings all were pretty tasty. The pork buns were especially good, bigger and more full of meat than most chinese restaurants I've been too. Egg rolls were pretty much the standard stuff, but the fried shrimp balls were quite tasty (I feel weird saying that for some reason, lol). The rice was tasty, a bit sticky and moist with lots of stuff mixed in. The one item that completely shocked the table on how yummy  it was was the homemade sweet tofu. Very yummy, my wife ended up getting a second bowl.

Something to keep in mind though is that it takes time for the waiters to bring out all the carts. We noticed that at around 11:30, just as we were finishing up, the waiters were bringing out the more savory meat dishes and so on. Kind of annoying, but makes me think that next time I come I'll have to plan on either taking my sweet time with my meal or come a little later and deal with the wait. All in all it was an enjoyable meal, but going as a group really ended up helping because we got to sample more and had plenty of good conversation going.

At this dim sum, when it's close to 5pm they give you a chart where you circle what you want. I was quite disappointed that I couldn't see what I like and immediately grab it. 

We we're also confuse because we both aren't familiar with the names of dim sum food so we were constantly describing the server what we wanted and he had to circle it on our charts.

Dim sum offerings are your standard, sui mai, hai gow (shrimp dumplings), tofu skin wrapped with pork and mushroom, shrimp with rice noodle, etc. Everything taste good except the shrimp from my shrimp dumplings tasted a bit fishy which usually means it was not fresh. 
Their chow mein with no meat was exceptionally tasty and the texture of the noodle still retains a bit of crunchiness but not to the point of a crispy noodle style. Very tasty. Their red bean boa is excellent. Prices are very reasonable. Service was friendly and attentive. 

For Las Vegas, Chang's dim sum is pretty good considering you are smack in the middle of a desert so this is an oasis if you are craving for some authentic dim sum. I also noticed alot of the customers were chinese which is a great sign. Chang's is a bit off the main strip but totally worth the trip. I will definitely come back when I am in Vegas.

I've never been disappointed with my food. My favorite is the shrimp noodle and the pork bun mmm. Service is fine, nothing amazing, but pretty standard for dim sum. If you're used to eating out at Chinatown, you should be used to being a little aggressive in getting a server's attention haha.

In comparison:

East Ocean: Not as expensive as this place.  There are more than 2 carts going around serving you food

Harbor Palace:  This place is really dirty.  Food seems like its been hanging out in the cart all day and the service isn't that great.

The staff was very friendly.  Food is constantly being regulated throughout the restaurant and they offer all the delights of a standard dim sum (shu mai, chicken feet etc...) 

Food highlights:  

1. The pork belly is an absolute must get, I kid you not. This exceeds any pork belly i've gotten at goyemon, AYCE kbbq and lechon at the several filipino parties i've been to.  The skin is deep fried to utter perfection while the meat is juicy and very tender.

2. Deep fried shrimp balls with the sweet mayo

3. The duck was very good but a little on the saucy side

4. Chicken feet was delicious.  Plenty of cartilage to suck on 

Service:

A lot of the staff speak 0 english.  Even if you have dark skin, pale skin or blue skin, they will talk to you in chinese.  Staff is very friendly and anyone is willing to stop what they are doing to see what you need.

I came on a Thursday around noon with some friends and there was plenty of available sitting.  They offer complimentary tea my friend introduced me to pu-erh tea, which is a black tea.  It had a nice roasted, dark taste, if you're looking to try something other than jasmine or green tea. 

There were 4 different carts roaming around the room.  We ordered the Shrimp Rice Roll, Chicken Feet (4 pieces), Shumai (4 pieces), Har Gow (4 pieces), Pork Spareribs, Turnip Cake, Egg Tarts, and Xiao Long Bao (large). 

The XLB has a 20 minute wait time upon ordering.  They bring it out on a bamboo steamer accompanied with a red vinegar sauce.  The sauce isn't needed since there's soup inside.  It was nice and hot, but half of the XLB wasn't soupy enough.  Nice effort Chang's.  It's better than the tin pan things you get at KJ's for sure, but it doesn't quite satisfy my cravings.  

Pricing is pretty reasonable, our bill came to $36 and left the three of us pretty satisfied.  Our servers took good care of us, and kept refilling our water and tea pot, which was nice and different from other Chinese restaurants.  I liked that their serving size for most dishes was 4 pieces, i'm used to seeing 3 pieces/dish at other places.

We got the Chinese sliced BBQ prok ""cha-shu"", shrimp dumplings ""ha-gow"", shu-mai , Chinese broccoli ""gai-lan"", salt and pepper squid and prawns. Their BBQ pork steam buns ""cha-shu bao"" were decent and the fried taro dumplings were excellent. The steamed soy-skin wrapped with bamboo and pork was surprisingly good. 

The service was good and what makes it such a sight for sore eyes is seeing older Chinese people sitting at the table next to us relaxing and reading newspapers while enjoying their dishes. Now that speaks volumes.",8BV5Hm4Nygujx3cdoP_EtA,2,0,4,iLe0s5BivHnxC-K8gOSBUg

A standout was the roast duck, whose skin was very crispy and the meat was thick.  I have no idea how much it cost but it was sufficient in quantity to be shared by 3 hungry male adults.

Easy location near Orleans, Palms, and several timeshare properties.

Bill for 5 adults and 4 children was $78.20 including tip, for eating dim sum until full but not gorging.

Note: the room was warm, not nearly as hot as the 110 degrees it was outside when we visited, but not quite comfortable either, and  worthy of checking the AC system.",uFoLXDuKKbM6knOiQedVzw,1,0,4,U3aGZT-kYuJiIyo3P3mKwg

By 1130, the restaurant was hopping and I felt better that there were others enjoying their Dim Sum.  This restaurant was located on S Decatur Blvd between W Harmon Blvd and W Tropicana Blvd in Las Vegas.

I asked for the Hot Chili Pepper Oil and an older gentleman brought me a small dish.  I actually prefer this to the communal container which is traditionally on the table.

There were 4 dishes that really stood out here:

Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf: There were large chunks of Chinese Mushoom, Chinese Sausage, and Shrimp.  The filling wasn't all ground up.  This has been the best ""Chinese Tamale"" so far out of the 4 Dim Sum Houses I have tried in Las Vegas.

BBQ Pork Pie:  The 3 triangular pies were large and so flaky.  I loved the glistening of the egg wash.  The BBQ pork was sweet with large chunks.  My husband would love these.

Baked Sweet Custard Bun:  The outside was crusty, the bun was so soft.  The custard was thick and a little on the sweet side.

Baked Custard Tarts:  Light flaky crust, creamy custard.  Good sized.

Everything else was average.

The Shrimp Rice Noodle had 2 rolls with a total of 6 good sized shrimp.  The server cut the rolls into 6 pieces and poured a sweet soy sauce over the noodles.  There were no scallions or anything in the rolls besides the shrimp.

The 4 Siu Mai had pale orange eggs on top and were luke warm coming from a steaming cart.  Perhaps yesterday's leftovers?

The 4 Har Gow had a very delicate outer noodle.  It tore as I tried to pick up a dumpling.  There were whole pieces of shrimp with chopped bamboo shoots.

The 3  Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (Haam Sui Gau): were okay, but not outstanding.  They were warm, not hot.

I asked a server for the Don Tot (Baked Custard Tarts).  She said maybe later.

I did not see any Shark Fin Dumpling or Steamed Pork Ribs in Black Bean Sauce.

There was a young boy going around refilling tea.  My empty plates were cleared frequently.  The service was better here than at other Dim Sum Houses.  There were a few English speaking people like the young girl who brought me the Sticky Rice with Lotus Leaf.

As I went up to the cash register to pay, a server brought me a tray of Don Tot.  I bought one order which had the usual 3 pieces.

The rest was wonderful. Something I'd never had before was dim sum with whole peanuts (shelled, of course). That was different and excellent. That was probably my favorite of today. There was another fried dim sum that was all vegetables, most prominently scallions. Those two were my favorites today.

We came in today for the party and David, the same guy that took my reservation, claimed that we had no reservation.  The story continued to change (that we needed a deposit; That we had not confirmed that reservation - basically lying).  The manager, David is a sneaky, slimy piece of work.

After enough yelling, David inconveniencing my family, and ruining my birthday party - we were moved into the room.  He was incredibly rude to my mother, who showed up 15 minutes earlier than I had and never said sorry to me.

We wanted vegetable spring rolls and they said they were ""out"" of them. Then we wanted cucumber Szechuan style and he had no idea what I was talking about but eventually said they didn't have any of those either.  We drove to pick up our order and the building looked a little run down. There were about 2 cars in the parking lot and we thought it was out of business. We went in and nobody greeted us so we went into the dining room. There was only one table eating. It took about 5 minutes of us waiting around to pay and then they finally gave us our food. When we got home, there was sauce that spilled in the bottom of one of the bags.  We carefully took the takeout boxes out of the bags and they were extremely greasy.

I just let them do all the ordering. I did the eating. The chrysanthemum tea was an interesting change-up (we had that and regular tea). You gotta drink tea when you Yum Cha!

4669610,2010-06-01,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"This review is really long overdue. I remember having this during the weekend of CES, yup all the way back in January. This was my first dim sum experience in Vegas.

@ Shrimp Dumplings - Good shrimp and texture on the skin. 

@ Pork Dumplings - This looked good, but it did have a taste like it was spoiled.

@ Fried Shrimps - Its similar to the stuff you get in the frozen food isle and you deep fry quickly.

@ Fried Shrimp in Wonton Skin - This is a much better appetiizer than the fried shrimp. Its more crispier and you can actually taste the shrimp flavor in this.

@ Shrimp in Rice Noodles - The shrimp was good, but the rice noodles and soy sauce just seem out of place. The rice noodle was a little mushy and it seems like they used the wrong kind of soy sauce, not the diluted soy sauce.

@ Congee - This was just bad. Lack of flavor and just disappointing for me. 

@ Egg Filled Buns - Another disappointing item. The fillings could have more flavor, but its just a bun with an egg filling. Just blah. 

@ Sweet Tofu Desert - Good smooth taste. Nothing spectacular however.

This is one of the more inexpensive dim sums in town and probably one of the better ones. But that isn't saying much. I would say this place falls short of Ping Pang Pong slightly, but not by much. Those raised with CA dimsum will be disappointed. Everyone else should enjoy the dishes.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,1,1,3,MIUqDcWYPgW5d6OOcDMjRQ

It's Sunday and you're hungry for that wholesome Chinese buffet or Dim sum! Well I can't speak for any of you but I was starving  for dim sum.  First of, spot has a small lot so come early.  The selection is mediocre.  They have the  usual suspects like tripe, chicken  feet, fish  balls, shumai, shrimp noodles, etc.  The staff is fast and the servers are even faster.  The food cart is always  coming.  The food first of is as good as they get in Vegas.  It's fresh  and juicy.  The  meats and seafood are tasty and doesn't taste dry  like other spots in Vegas.  I highly recommend at least visiting this place on the weekday for lunch.

Food is So So
Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING

4699317,2017-11-04,18,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"They say finger pointing is bad, but if you're going for dim sum- finger pointing is great! You get to point at the food you want and bam! Hot and tasty pot stickers on your table! If you haven't had dim sum before, it is like a la cart Chinese steamed foods, but the food is actually pushed around in carts! The waiters roll around the carts that keep the food nice and hot around the room. You get a paper ticket (kind of like the one in Bingo) and they mark your card every time you pick something off their cart. Some carts are in Category A, which is like $3, Category B is like $4, and so on and so forth. Since everything is individual, you can get to try a lot of things without breaking the bank or feeling committed to eat the whole thing if you didn't like it. 

The atmosphere is casual and in a way traditional. A fish tank and live lobsters swim on the left and there are a lot of big round tables for large family and friend gatherings. It's not a fancy place, but it is clean, welcoming, and the food has been consistently delicious. I usually get the rice roll filled with beef, but it comes in shrimp and pork too. They put a soy sauce on it that is slightly sweet and not as tangy as regular soy sauce. It compliments the meat very well. 3 come in an order. The shrimp har gow needs no soy sauce. It is a steamed dumpling filled with shrimp. It's light, flavorful, and 4 pieces come in an order. The Chinese meatball is also steamed and is another favorite for me. Tender and the hint of green onions really add to the taste. The beef tripe was also good. It is cooked with ginger, so that was different for me. It was not greasy and I would order it again. Steamed char siu buns are light and fluffy with a decent amount of bbq pork in the middle. Chicken feet was well marinated and chewy. It is boney though, but after all it is chicken feet. Lol. They also have hot rice congee, which is a thick rice porridge. Comforting and cooked low and slow with chicken broth for a good full bodied flavor. Be sure to order the Chinese donut to go with it too. It's a long cylindrical fried bread that you dip in the rice porridge to add an element of crunchy chewiness to the dish. Then, if you get there early enough you can get the egg custard tartletts from the dessert cart. The crust is buttery and flaky. The egg custard in the middle just melts in your mouth. A great way to end the meal. Be sure to order a pot of the chrysanthemum tea to round out the whole experience.

Service is great on top of everything. The waiters checked on how I was doing and consistently removed the empty metal trays as they were empty. The managers do a good job on making sure everyone is happy and keeping the carts full of fresh and hot food. The prices are very reasonable too. I will definitely be coming back again.

Thanks to Jean C, my Vegas Yelp connection, for telling me about Chang's. I loved the atmosphere. The restaurant was buzzing with Cantonese, and it felt like I was in a tea house in Hong Kong. The hostess asked me if I needed a fork! I guess being an ABC is really that obvious. But no thank you, I can handle the sticks just fine.

This restaurant is not in Chinatown. It is a standalone building about 3 miles south of Chinatown, and a short Uber ride from Mandalay Bay. The building is nice, and I preferred it over the typical strip center or having to navigating through the Gold Coast to get to Ping Pang Pong (although I really like it there). The dining room is perfect size. It is big enough that you don' t feel overcrowded, but also not one of those oversized rooms that hosts gigantic wedding banquets. The hostess told me that the restaurant has been open for many years but it changed owners this year.

Dim Sum as a single person is not ideal because you might not try as many dishes as you would with a group. But that doesn't stop me. I ordered tripe, pai qwat, gai lan, shark's fin dumpling, and shrimp balls on mushrooms. I was a little disappointed that I didn't see more unique dim sums, but their execution of these traditional items was well above average. I recommend Chang's for Dim Sum and I would definitely come back.",loHW3nLm8Ex5BbCu7QOVaA,13,6,5,VO5Fcv_p2aFj4riTu_LtcA

We're on the other side of town but we brave the distance just to satisfy our craving for good, authentic Chinese food. Since we are regulars, we often interfaced with the original owners and their customer service has always been excellent. Saw many changes when new management took over. Food remained commendable, tho, so we still come to this place but not as often as before. However, today, we got an incredible response from a server when we requested for some measures to keep a hovering fly from touching base with our food, even suggesting a lighted candle. And he goes, ""We don't have any, and even if we do, I can't take it out for you."" I insisted on him doing something about the fly and he responded, ""There is nothing we can do about that. We have to call the Department of Health for them to address the situation."" Wow! That was the most laughable and unbelievable response I've ever heard especially from a food server! 
My instinct was to jump up and leave immediately but my husband was so hungry after fasting for a medical procedure so we stayed on but had to cover three dishes with napkins to keep the fly from going into our food! What a way to have dinner!

4872055,2014-07-03,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"The Las Vegas strip is a great place to eat, even if you want Asian food. There are Chinese buffets galore as well as a number of new Korean restaurants (including the nearby Kim Chee Restaurant and at least two others just north of the Stratosphere). But what is really impressive is the string of great oriental food palaces located west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo.
 
The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. Start with the first large restaurant that you come to driving west, Satay Malaysian Grille. It offers an exotic selection of Southeast Asian and Singapore fare, a mix of Thai and Indian flavors, spicy, sweet and savory good. Try the traditional Satay, the shrimp and papaya salad, and the Laksa, highlighted with peanut sauce, coconut milk, and shellfish. Continuing down the street are a number of Chinese marketplaces peppered with great little eating places. If you seek the familiar there is even a Sam Woo's Barbeque, with its delicious pork, duck and noodle dishes. For fish and crab try Seafood Harbor. For Korean try the Sweet Pig. If Vietnamese Pho noodle soup is your preference there are half a dozen little joints all in the same area.
 
One Chinese treat that I found especially satisfying was the Dim Sum at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine on Decatur, about ten blocks south of Spring Mountain, just north of Tropicana. Chang's is located in a white Chinese style building on the east side of the street. The day that I went there, on a Thursday, the place was packed with locals, mostly Chinese. They had one of the best sticky rice in lotus leaves that I have ever had, and their fun rolls (rice noodle) were delicious too. The prices were right, with most dim sum dishes costing between $1.75 and $2.50, substantially lower than the average place in LA. I did not eat at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for dinner, but I took a look at the menu and it offered a fine array of traditional Hong Kong/Cantonese style dishes at reasonable prices.
 
So the next time you are in Vegas, don't forget to try the flavors of California's favorite Chinatown in Nevada, Spring Mountain Blvd in Las Vegas, and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for Dim Sum, seven days a week located at 4670 S. Decatur Blvd. Las Vegas, NV 89103, phone: (702) 362-3663.",S7VG3vBUtJDLKX_ewbc15A,1,0,4,8zYMTwcf82e36lEzx6eEAQ

5.  Price - Very reasonable.

6.  Cart Frequency - The movement of the cart to get what you want or to even catch them by waving is a bit off.

Well, the dim sum wasn't all that great. It was mediocre at best. We had 4 baskets and the total came to slightly over $11 before tip. The tripe was flavorless, the stuffed bean curd sheets were okay. Har gow were below average, leaving the cha siu bao being the only thing passable. One of the servers came over and asked if we wanted to order some food. I asked hubby and he asked for the check. The woman then asked me in Cantonese if the food wasn't to my liking.

During our 3 night stay in Vegas, we decided to try Chang's HK Cuisine for their dim sum based on their Yelp reviews.  We were expecting a wait since it was a Sunday at lunch, but there wasn't a wait.

The restaurant was about 75% full when we arrived for lunch.  We were immediately seated and the women pushing the carts started coming by our table.  We got some of our favorites - BBQ pork bun, siu mai, shrimp rice noodle, and sesame balls.  All were fairly good, but the one dish they didn't have was my favorite - shrimp dumplings (har gow).  I really wanted to try har gow at Chang's, but every time I asked a woman, she said she didn't have it.  

Chang's goes on the tiered pricing model, so some dishes are more expensive than others.  Most places in Los Angeles are like this too, which is why I love Ocean Star because they have a flat pricing schedule.

The food was good at Chang's and about the same as other dim sum places I've tried in the Vegas Chinatown area.  The best thing about Chang's was we didn't have to wait for a table!

We got four dishes and the bill came out to around $16.00.  Please see my pictures.

Dont remember exactly what we ordered but for sure some of the basic: shrimp dumpling, siu mai, sticky rice, chicken feet, pork ribs, mango pudding, rice rolls, baos.. etc, and it was all pretty good. The service was good and the restaurant was pretty full. The bill was generous, spent around $55ish for the 4 of us.. but we ordered a variety.

4974369,2010-12-11,4,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Things have changed since my last review of Chang's, so it looks like another update is necessary!

First off - the sign out front!  Yay, they got rid of that faded old sign advertising Chang's.  Although I'm not particularly fond of their tacky new font, at least it's legible! 

Looks like prices have gone up too!

Group A - $2
Group B - $2.75
Group C - $3.95 
Group D - $5.95
Group E - $7.95

For our hungry party of three, we had five items from Group A, seven items from Group B, and one item from Group C.

They included:

* Shrimp Dumplings
* Pork Dumplings
* Beef Ball
* Tofu Skin Roll
* Steamed Tripe
* Beef Rice Noodle Roll
* Chicken Feet in Black Bean Sauce 
* Deep Fried Ground Pork Dumpling
* Deep Fried Taro and Ground Pork Dumpling
* Shanghai Dumplings (Group C) - It's something they don't push around in the carts.  You have to put in a special order for it.  Our order was had four dumplings, but you can request eight.  It came out piping hot - just the way it's supposed to be.  Be careful with the soup inside because it burned my tongue! 

The whole point of going out for dim sum is to ""yum cha"" which means to drink tea. Therefore, tea charges is as follows:

* Tea is $.50/person
* Chrysanthemum tea is $1/per person

I wanted to end our lunch with something sweet and looked over the Egg Custard Tarts.  They appeared to be the same ones that were out when we first arrived, so I passed on that.  We also skipped on the Egg Custard Pineapple Bun this time around since we didn't see them come out fresh, and these buns needed to be eaten piping hot only!  They did offer the dessert tofu dish, but that's not my favorite.  Perhaps they need a better sweet selection or at least a higher turnover on it so things can still come out fresh! 

The service was surprisingly attentive on a Monday and there was no wait.  Our water glasses and tea pot were constantly refilled without us asking, which we really appreciated.  A large bus group did arrive shortly after us and did take up some of the attention, but it was understandable.

Unfortunately, they do not have hot chili oil anymore, just the regular hot chili sauce.  I'll continue to ask for it in case they bring it back!

I was soooo happy to have some dim sum after 3 nights in vegas..! The building design is so cute, looks like a little temple...there is lots of parking and didn't take long for our party to get seated. 

The dim sum came around in the carts (which is always a plus) and EVERY SINGLE THING that came off the carts were DELICIOUS! like scrum-dee-lee-umptious! The bbq pork buns were smaller than what i'm used to and the bbq was a bit lighter than what i've had but it was still good!

5014751,2008-04-08,1,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"Just got back from a trip to Vegas for my husbands BDay.  My husband loves dim sum so I  searched yelp for a decent dim sum place to take him.  This was my first official dim sum experience (with the carts).We both loved it.  We went on a Saturday right at 10:30 when they opened, the place is nice ,nothing fancy  but didn't notice anything dirty about it.  We had one of the first tables in the middle right by where the carts come out of the kitchen and they would all stop by us first with all of the fresh food.  Service was actually good (maybe because it was at the beginning of the day!) Both myself and my husband commented that it was some of the best service that we have had in a Chinese restaurant.   There were probably 6 carts and all of the women were nice and opened the dishes to show us what they had and tried their hardest to explain what each dish was.  Luckily my husband and myself kind of knew what we were looking for, you may have a hard time figuring out what is what if you don't know dim sum.  The women are usually only able to tell you what meat or filling a dish had, however, they do have quite a few pictures on their website if you need help.
 
Some dishes we had: shrimp har gow (good), sil myl (very good), pork dumpling (good) baked BBQ pork bao (very good) , veggie egg roll (good), meatball (very good) sesame ball (good) baked egg bao(good)  beef rice noodle roll (least favorite, not a lot of flavor, the only dish we didn't finish) and my favorite the baked sweet bun (very good, like a Hawaiian sweet roll with sugar crumb coating....OH YUM!).   

Our total came to $25 and we were stuffed.  We loved it and will definitely come back when we visit Vegas again.  My husband even mentioned stopping by on Sunday  on our way out of town!",nn-qEKqomjZ4CNUp4MLvCQ,1,1,4,jcurAOlCsMv0DkkNTtVIww
5041572,2014-08-25,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"As I get ready to move, my coworkers and friends slowly have been reaching out to take me to lunch as a goodbye meal. One of those close friends thought it would be awesome to get some dim sum for lunch. I've only been to one place in the valley so I was excited to try another place out.

The place is not in Chinatown but close enough. As you approach the building you'll notice a nice Chinese bridge to walk through in order to get through the front door which I thought was a nice touch. When you enter the joint, you'll notice a lot of space! Big round tables everywhere, big windows, lots of Chinese art and symbols. This place looks authentic. The staff was friendly and although there was a language barrier in some cases, they were very patient with us. 

The food was alright. Not the best that I've tried in Las Vegas. My favorite was a pork and shrimp hash type dumpling. It reminded me of back home. Some dishes that weren't such a success was the fried rice. It was molded in a bowl and super oily. Lots of the things served, seemed to be sitting a while and not as fresh as I've tasted in the past. I appreciated the dim sum selection as there were a lot, however, most of what was offered wasn't as fresh as I hoped. 

I'm thinking this was just a fluke. I really hope to give them another chance soon. I don't necessarily think they were the worst and their staff was super nice. I'll be back and hopefully my review will be updated with a higher rating.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,2,2,3,v19i2WYRd50todF3ukKQ6w

We ordered 

*Shumai (3x)- pretty decent, juicy.
*Shrimp Har Gow- filling was fresh, but the dumpling skins stuck together...meh.
*cheong fun w/ shrimp- these are rolled rice (noodle) rolls...the rolled rice was good but, it only had 2 shrimps in each and I'm used to more filling...these are my favorite so I was kinda sad panda. These were just steamed, not steamed then stir fried w/ sesame that I'm used to, but okay, I like this version too. It just was okay overall...
*douchi spare ribs- I love pork and I love black beans. Though you order these anywhere and they are bony, it's all about the flavor and these were good. 
*Fried Rice, sticky style- I thought this was good, but my buddy thought it was just plain fried rice....it was misleading since I thought all the sticky rice comes in leafs. Really, where's the lotus leaf wrapping?! It taste better that way when it picks up the subtle flavors. It had peanuts, dried shrimp, mushrooms, sliced pork. 
*Fried shrimp w/mayo (2x)- it's shrimp, its fried wrapper, it's mayo...what is not to like? 
*Hom Sui Gok-ground pork, the thick layer of mochi like wrapper and the crunch of the outside being fried makes for a nice texture meld. There was something missing though in the flavor of the filling that I couldn't quite place.
*Black Bean Clams- these were in a good sauce, but was just okay. the clams were sparse and most of the shells were empty without the meat somewhere on the plate. WTF?! Most expensive dish at $7.95 and not worth it. 

That came to $37 and overall, it was a decent meal. So now why 2 stars?

Firstly, it's a hot day, and it was a bit stuffy in there....they need some better A/C and/or more fans around the place. Our drinks were pretty neglected and we had to keep trying to flag people for water (there aren't that many servers and a cart lady ain't gonna stop to get you some). We got one refill in our small water cups and we were pretty dehydrated. 

Now I know that sometimes servers say things that assume ""guilao"" don't know things, but it's usually said in a manner that is matter-of-fact, trying to be helpful and making sure the person doesn't feel awkward not knowing something. The first cart lady was rude and I did not like how she was talking to Angela H. like she was a fucking idiot when she knows well enough to order with proper names of foods. No, you do not need to point at which is har gow and shumai, she ordered it with those names, so I'm sure you don't need to teach a bitch holding chopsticks. We're not that white, jeez. The kicker is another cart lady came by and the lady was pointing and talking about our table. We aren't idiots and know it's talking shit about us since it's blatant, but you also don't know that my brothers are Chinese. Yeah, thanks for the hospitality so a nice wish for you; ham gaa fu gwai. This is said with much sarcasm if the obvious isn't obvious enough. One thing to treat people like guilao and think we need to be told something or given forks automatically, but another when we are treated as yang guizi. It is NOT acceptable to discriminate and belittle customers. 

 I feel this is somewhat a limited selection of offerings, but alas I was spoiled with a imperial selection in LA. It's hard not to compare to how awesome it was back home, so I try my best to minimize the comparisons because I will always set myself for a bad day.  I was looking for ""common"" items like dan tat (egg tarts) or siew yuk (crispy skinned roast pork) and they seem to not have it so I could not help be disappointed and think of home. Maybe they run out of the good stuff fast (we were there at 1pm-ish) , but hell I'm not waking up to beat the church goers and the club people. And I certainly have less patience when I can't get food AND water. Bring a drink if you're a group of white/non Chinese basically. 

I am still on the mission to try all the (limited) dim sum places and find the ""best"" of Vegas....even though it'll probably be mediocre to home.

For Chang's though, I came to one conclusion- though we have a limited selection of dimsum spots here, I am not that desperate to come back unless with all my Chinese family and they suggest it (not likely gonna happen- they're from California).",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,4,2,Pr100gCECGkBUq9IczN3sA

That's when I discovered Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine, via the internet... and it did NOT disappoint!

Daily dim sum is always a plus in my book, and Chang's serves it up hot and fresh.  I found their service to be NICER than the local restaurants here in the OC, which gets major points in my book!  

We stuck with the usual dishes; har-gow (shrimp wrapped in ""clear"" starch wrap...), vegetable shumai, lo mai gai (sticky rice with meat & mushroom mix wrapped in a lotus leaf...), a few other dishes that I have no clue the names to, lol... AND, we ordered the walnut shrimp from the regular menu.  

Everything from the dim sum carts was as to be expected; hot, fresh, flavorful, and moist.  The walnut shrimp was incredible, although I felt there to be an over-abundance of the mayo sauce for my personal taste.

Did I mention how stellar the service was?  Friendly, inviting, prompt, and not ""all up in your face"".  I will visit Chang's every time I head out to Vegas, it has become my favorite local joint for good, authentic Chinese cuisine.

The crispy noodles saved the meal but they had a very distinct fried taste I've never tasted before on a crispy noodle. Maybe the oil was old. I don't know.

Second Breakfast:  Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine

Note - the restaurant has been under new ownership since 2017.  Quality has improved.

Summary - Best of the bunch and the best in Vegas for everyday dim sum.

Har Gao Benchmark - Very thin, translucent, highly glutinous crystal skin with near perfect  moisture content and chew.  Shrimp within a good blend of previously frozen paste and pieces, well seasoned, MSG evident.

Service - Carts with special items direct from the kitchen.

Price - In line.  Inexpensive.

Authenticity - 80% Asian.  Many misspellings in the menu.

Selection - Large.  All the standards plus more.

Shu mai - Good blend of coarse finely ground pork and shrimp with lots of crab eggs on top adding complexity.  MSG evident.  
Steamed BBQ pork bun - Fluffy and fresh with sparse but intensely seasoned, sweet filling.
Mochi rice in Lotus leaf - Smaller than most allowing the flavor of the leaf to penetrate throughout.  Lots of savory pork and duck egg within.
Chicken feet - Tender with almost no chew to the skin.  Over seasoned.
Beef tripe - Fall apart tender.  Very pronounced ginger flavor.  Very good.
Fried turnip cake - Light and puffy.  Neutral flavor.  Crisp on the outside.  Somewhat oily.
Egg tart - Fresh, flaky with lots of lard.  Well controlled sweetness of the custard.

Edges out the competition in freshness and flavor.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,27,28,4,X0hVZvwDp620YwtKhY7A9A

0 for service. Had to literally yell out to the waiter to get to our table just for a water refill. I know they didn't want to come back because they just gave us the WHOLE PITCHER OF WATER. 

Also with all the food we ordered, they couldn't  was even remove our empty dishes. They just tried fitting all the food without even thinking that maybe they should take empty plates out for it to fit.

The food was fresh and delicious, lots of choices and everything was a hit.  The pork buns were still warm, the turnip cake was delicious, and we were so excited that they had porridge and the Chinese donuts!  Service was not great, but that's no surprise- the food more than made up for it.

We came after the bustling lunch crowd (~2 pm), so there were slim pickings left and many of the dishes came out cold. Despite that, the flavour of the dishes was pretty authentic although lacked a bit of finesse. Har gao were soft and tasty, and our just-fried crab balls were crispily delicious. Other dishes that were fine even cold were: sticky fried rice, turnip cakes, eggplant stuffed with shrimp. The pork siu mai were so-so in appearance and flavour, but the noodle plates we ordered à la carte (chow mein and beef chow fun) were aromatic and tasty.
I think coming back during peak hours would ensure hot and fresh dim sum offerings from the kitchen. Not bad at all (and compared to North Carolina standards, is practically five stars.)",fkiZ7pUJtaEsMtmTP87eUQ,1,1,3,N7cNu2Wok3sNTHCKM3BWMg

They invited me to Changs to lunch where I had met them.  They explained to me how it worked but they did all the ordering because I would probably order some weird stuff.  
Now I dont know the names of any of the stuff I ate..so im going to try and describe it was best as I can....

We had some sort of Round Flat noodle (good!)

Pork Buns ( Great!)

Shrimp wrapped in won ton paper ( GREAT!)

Shrimp Balls served w/ Mayo ( LOVED IT)

Some type of meat on a bone. ( GOOD!)

Veggie ball ( didnt try it)

Bok Choy ( AWESOME)

Chicken Feet - Okay! I wasn't going to try this but I figured why not?
I guess its an aquired taste because I put a TOE in my mouth and tried to suck off the skin....and its kind of just oozed onto my tongue.  I gracefully put the foot onto my plate and there it stayed the rest of the meal.  
I just couldn't handle the texture.  The seasoning and light chile sauce was great but the gelatenous skin wasn't doing it for me....AT ALL!!

I know we ate more but I can't remember anything else ..(i was still drunk from the night before!)

Described by someone I trust as the best Dim Sum in our little patch of the desert it was with high hopes that myself and three others sat down just after 11:30am at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine and although the Saturday Cart traffic pattern would frequently prove frustrating throughout the course of our 90 minute meal it was nonetheless with broad smiles that we worked out way through over a dozen baskets of dumplings and buns before culminating in a $12 prepped-to-order Roast Duck amongst the best in the city alongside kitchen fresh walnut prawns far outperforming their modest $6 tab.  Undoubtedly a gluttonous meal but one priced competitively to that of KJ or Cathay House with food on par with the former and far superior to the second as items felt to be 'too old' by servers were twice delayed until fresh versions could be procured from the kitchen it was with a wide swath and steady pacing that we cut our path through a selection of over fifty options and with only the overly thick wrapper of the har gow and oily pan-fried mixed dumplings proving less than impressive to my tooth an 88% batting average was still quite impressive for any dim sum spot, let alone one situated well outside of Chinatown on an industrial stretch of South Decatur.  Having already spoke to the quality of the crispy roast duck and snappy prawns finding skillful balance between cream and crunch beneath a milky sweet sauce it should generally go without saying that freshest items proved the strongest options throughout our meal and with the herb-tinged congee a personal favorite along with molten baked custard buns I'd be remiss to not also mention a pair of novelties that proved equally impressive, the first featuring steamed egg custard topped with tender shrimp in an umami-laden broth and the second a delectable Red Bean Bun delivered  as a sticky golden spin on the cinnamon roll with a slight-savory finish bridging the classic Chinese ingredient to a Western palate in a way that many traditional Dim-Sum 'sweets' do not.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,5,4,iGft3DBZsbigvEMsFxJaRQ

The stuff on the steam cart is hot, fresh, and delectable, especially their siu mai and har gow (shrimp dumplings) though the rice noodles with beef or shrimp is as bountiful as Cathay House's. And on the contrary, the dishes from the cold cart (not exactly what the correct term for this is, the so-called cart contains dishes such as baked chasiubao, fried shrimp dumplings, and sesame balls) is lukewarm and leaves you yearning for more. The servers consistently refilled our tea kettles, though they failed to remove the empty porcelain and wood dishes. 

Even on weekdays, Chang's is bustling and on weekends the line goes out the door.

5349064,2014-05-09,1,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"My friends, my family, and I have frequented Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine for dim sum for as long as I could remember. When my family wants dim sum, this is the place to go. When my friends want dim sum, this is the place to go. However, after being away from Vegas for the past 3 years, things have drastically changed. I'm not sure if it's because of my taste buds or perhaps with other dim sum places popping up, such as KJ Kitchen at Rio....things have changed at Chang's.

Quality certainly has gone downhill. The service, on the other hand, I have seen no changes. It's still just like any other Chinese place where it's hard to find anyone to help you when you need it. 

My family and I came here for lunch this past Sunday and I must say, it was very disappointing. Half of the food that we wanted weren't readily available -- they were making it in the back. Some of them came out and some just were never ready. There used to be a lot more carts going around but now it's been reduced to about 3-4 different cards. It also used to be a whole lot more busy here so I assume because of the lack of business, they no longer have that many carts going around. 

The food? Not memorable at all. AT ALL. Some of it was kind of gross .. even for me! The quality sure has changed!  

Overall, I wouldn't suggest this place for dim sum. It's honestly only ""okay"" because this certainly isn't the worst place.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,1,3,wRVMi4lQjKnGNDb8MK1UGA
5360589,2011-01-29,1,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"My husband, daughter and I decided to try a different dim sum place other than the usual Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant on Sahara so when headed over to Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine on Decatur, after all, it's been much talked about by so many of our friends.  It was hard to say whether this place was much better or much worse than our usual.  Some of the dim sum items tasted similar to Orchid's and some of them tasted different with a little change in one or two ingredients in the mix.  For instance, I prefer their shrimp har gau over Orchid's, but I rather enjoy Orchid's wrapped rice over Chang's.  What wasn't so good at Chang's was their dim sum items on the carts that didn't carry the steam baskets of goodness.  The eggplant, fried shrimp, all the items on plates that weren't steamed were served to us COLD!  Now if that isn't a kill to the palate, then I don't know what is!  Ugh!  Very displeasing, for sure!  No one expects food to be served cold like that.

We had lunch during the peak business lunch hour, but were seated immediately.  The ambiance is quite different from that of Orchids, possibly due to the popularity of the place.  I'm sure Chang's is very well received in the neighborhood, by how busy the place was; busy, meaning ""noisy.""  But, of course, I expect no less at any Chinese restaurant.  (Although, once again, I have to compare this to Orchid's lack of noisiness, thus, the lack of popularity, per se?)  Do not hesitate to wave down a server pushing their carts around.  This, by no means, means you are rude and disrespectful to them.  It's just the way of the land at many Chinese restaurants.  They have no notion of this as being rude in any way, so wave away!  It was the only way we could dine at the pace we wanted anyway...=o)

I gave them a 3-star rating because their food was good, albeit, some not served at the right temperature.  The service was to be expected.  The ambiance was nice to experience, and it was good to know people enjoy frequenting the place.  But, I have to say that I'm partial to Orchid's and probably won't go back to Chang's again.

The first dish is one of my all time favorites and the last is my mom's. 

I am certain the reason why I like them less is because they lack the chili oil sauce. They serve the vinegar red chili sauce instead and that gives everything a more sour kick than a spicy one. Some might not believe it, but this condiment makes the whole experience more enjoyable. I am willing to do more math, and risk being swindled for it. 

The service at Chang's is quick and friendly. I swear, I should like Chang's more, but the feast feels limited and my dim sum taste is vast.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,3,y3Pv1YnyyRhy2vU4PPwv_A

On our latest trip back to Vegas, hubby suggested hitting it up for old time's sake so I agreed. Good news is there was no wait at peak lunch hours.  Bad news is there is no wait at peak lunch hours.  I remember when it used to take an hour to get a table here.  But I guess back then, there weren't as many Asian eating establishments to compete with.

We ate solely their dim sum dishes and quite honestly, they're pretty tasty.  Hubby and I both love their version of ""Phoenix claws"" (a pretty euphemism for chicken feet).  Unlike most other soggy, overcooked mushy versions, this one had bite as well as flavor.  

It's also been a long time since I've paid any attention to the basics such as shau mai and har gow...but their har gow (shrimp dumplings) was a mini game-changer for me.  The skin was chewy and the filling was very delicious.  Did not fall apart when you picked it up.

Other faves:  stewed tripe, comes on the same cart as the thousand year old egg porridge.
Sticky rice dumping (salty water dumpling if you're translating from Chinese)

Service was efficient and brisk, sometimes even friendly.  We were in and out in less than an hour, eating at a leisurely pace.

Because of this, there is typically a wait, unless you get here right when it opens, and it can be a problem finding a parking spot. To combat this, you can always order your food to go, or call ahead to do so, and avoid the wait. Prices are average for dim sum, with a mix of 12 small and medium dishes coming in around $40 with tax.

As for the food, it is satisfying if you have a craving, but only just so. There is nothing here that I have loved, nor anything they make that I specifically crave. Most of the dishes are average, or even tasty. The problem is that they are extremely skimpy on the good stuff. For example, some of my dim sum favorites are char siu bao (bbq pork bun) and lo mai gai (stuffed sticky rice). Both of these are tasty here, but they come with very little filling. The bbq pork bun is too much bun and not nearly enough meat filling, I'd say less than half that of a good place in California. And the sticky rice is all rice, you honestly cannot say that there is a layer of filling, only small patches. The taste is there in the parts that you get, but there simply isn't enough of it. 

If you are in the area and don't want to drive to a casino or to the Chinese area of Las Vegas, then this place is alright. I definitely don't recommend you go out of your way to come here though.

Wasn't expecting anything comparable in SGV but service is much better and the food was good enough to not say bad things about this restaurant. However, it's very pricy compared to LA. My frd got a to go fried shrimp paste balls, 3 pieces and there goes her $5. Can't say how this compares to other dim sum places in Vegas since this is the only one I've been to. But overall, it's a good experience except for its prices of the dishes",nlsGVLWn9opdrl7wWJuERw,0,0,3,soB_6Rh37r7KCMZShmqpLw

I have been here on lots of occasions over the years. Sometimes the place is hit or miss as far as service goes, but that's to be expected. I do enjoy their dim sum quite a bit. I would be inclined to believe it's actually the best dim sum in town. If you come at the right time, you don't have to wait too long for a table and they come around really quickly with their carts full of delectable goodies. My favorite dim sum items are the salt and pepper prawns, wide noodles in XO sauce, whatever the vegetable of the day is there and their desserts. Pretty much everything else is good too. Their dinner entrees are pretty good as well. 

They do have great food and hit or miss service, but all in all this place is a great place to check out for some delicious Chinese cuisine. Great place for large parties as well. The more people, the more you get to share and try. Yum.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,1,4,uXfVBtOVtDKqyaH40_T0UQ
5961481,2016-09-03,0,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,Some of the food is extremely salty. I don't think anyone is taste testing any of the dishes.  I've been here 3 times and each time a few of the dishes were too salty to the point I couldn't eat it. One time I had to wash the beef tripe in water and I couldn't even taste any pork at all with the crispy pork belly because it was just pure salt.  Overall the dim sum dishes are good but I have no intentions of returning with the food being so salty and inconsistent.,ZaPk3cfb_Emd0ah9_XKxZg,0,0,2,7HlDq5rVUbMm2G0NZKSN-w
5973507,2010-11-14,2,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,"I was craving dim-sum and going through withdrawals of my selection in Monterey Park/ Alhambra.  After yelping it, it looks like the locals prefer Chang's and Orchid's.  So we tried Chang's.  

One positive is the fact that there was only a 5 minute wait, although it was a full house.  The majority of the patrons were asian so that was a good sign of its authenticity.  There also seemed to be a decent selection of dim sum options.

Here is the breakdown:
THE GOOD: 
-marinated and roasted pork dish with peanuts- delicious!
-fried sesame ball with red beans
-chicken feet

THE BAD:
-fried vegetable egg rolls
-har gou- the shrimp tasted weird. Must have been a bad batch.
-pork shu mai- lacked flavor, had to douse it in hot sauce. 

THE UGLY:
-rice flour with shrimp. The shrimp tasted funny and the sauce (which is usually my favorite part) was way too sweet. 
-jellyfish.  More disappointing was the fact that it was $7.95 and lacked flavor. 

I don't know if I'll be back.  I'll have to try Orchid's and give other dim sum restaurants a chance.  But first, I may have to lower my expectations a bit.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,2,3,R6eZLpuM8ZE-7azAwNQe1w

The dim sum menu is relatively diverse and most of the items are as good as one might expect. The flavors of the more complex and/or bizarre items are not as good, like the chicken feet. The soft tofu with ginger simple syrup was my favorite. Simple but reminds me of home on the Philippines.",Y_polWPxlC9e9EzAte-6PQ,0,0,4,Z2IoVQKAfZ8WA14Qj-J69w
