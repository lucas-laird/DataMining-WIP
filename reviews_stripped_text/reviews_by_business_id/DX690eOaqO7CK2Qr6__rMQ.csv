815914,2015-12-05,0,DX690eOaqO7CK2Qr6__rMQ,The pupusa flavor in this restaurant was okay. I ordered the plátanos maduro with beans and sour cream. The beans were watery which I didn't enjoy. I did get a discount on the pupusas when I ordered a dozen. I did have to ask if they had any deals though.,MMBKc1qWaFUyEw0TxjsxRg,0,0,3,r7GXR8kU73KYhpT-xe9MBA

I wish I had taken a before picture but was so amazed when I got my plate I just dug in. I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a good home cooked meal.,8rCjrzxnAYuB5-UVsV7AWQ,0,0,5,B1MwR5U36z71TFINvqLuzw

I wasn't expecting much when I first tried this soup but it was a pleasant surprise.  It's full of seafood and the broth has great depth.,ZlDqkOX-TolrPu5Qwh1U4A,0,0,5,-SwwDd9VmAdf_mHpqFw3ww
