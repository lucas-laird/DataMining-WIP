My girlfriend and I eat ""Rice n Noodle"" pretty often. Most of the time it's delivery. We usually get the Dinner special that includes egg rolls, rangoon, soup, rice and 2 entr√©es with a delivery fee of $2(i think) it all comes out to be about $26 or $27. Their generous portions take us 3 meals to finish. The math . . 
 $27 / 2 people =  $13.50 per person
$13.50 / 3meals = $4.50 per meal!!! Thats pretty decent if you ask me.
btw I'm a big boy. I can eat a good amount.

Lunch specials are awesome too. Delicious food, huge portions . $8

The service isn't too personable. They won't small talk with you while you wait for your food but they aren't rude by all means. 

Dining-in can be a little off putting at first because all their food is served in ""to-go"" containers. I've come to realize it's more practical as a consumer and economically as a restaurant manager. They give you so much food that your'e gonna take the rest home anyway and it saves them time and labor cost by not having to bus so much off the tables and the only things they have to wash are the pots pans and cookware the cooks use.

I love this place. If I every move away, I would consider Rice n Noodle one of the neighborhood institutions that I would miss and return to.",ZdQJqZ5OmC2Tr2kHztawSg,2,1,5,CgdSGX2RzgozWDd3W5rkKw

As soon as I stepped in I was immediately greeted by the lady at the counter and a middle-aged gentleman in glasses who was very cheerful and attentive. In fact, he had an energy and enthusiasm that made me EXCITED about the act of eating Chinese food, like when you first start going to these places as a child. I felt like a young Steve Simeone at The China Palace.

Store was clean and had a nice ambiance. Lucky cat, Chinese music and Christmas decorations in April which is both hilarious and charming. A pleasant and reassuring surprise is how the kitchen was in full view.

Since it was my first time, I just stuck with a simple order of the soup and some egg rolls. As the great Joey 'Coco' Diaz says ""If you screw up the pork fried rice, we got nothing to talk about.""

In less than five minutes, the man who took my order was thrilled to present it to me.

Once I got the food home, I first tried the egg rolls (with sweet and sour sauce). You could tell they were very freshly made and had a nice texture. Not much else to say, since these were just skinny appetizer egg rolls, not the potentially epic New York style egg rolls.

The Hot and Sour soup was even better than I expected! From the first tastes I was worried it wasn't spicy enough, but then it quickly started kicking my ass! Taking me half an hour to finish, it was joy eating the abundant freshly cooked, still firm vegetables, tofu and occasional eggs, shrimp and imitation crab as I sweated and blew my nose. Finished with the crispy noodles and fortune cookie.

Very good first impression. Will likely be back before I get another cold.",v3LaGRNCQyPs63G0ZaJxPg,0,0,4,12K9fUKFW0qbelhDQLp_cQ

For $8.95, this was a deal! The serving is enough for two people, or for one person to have leftovers for later. I had a sit down meal, so I'm not sure if the to-go orders would have the same portion size.

I give Rice N Noodle 3/5 stars because it is a fast food Chinese restaurant and it is exactly that. Everything is fried in a pan, with quick service.

I ordered the curry chicken and it did not come out as I expected. The dish is marked with a chili pepper for its spiciness, seasoned with chopped up bell peppers and onions. The dish was more of a quick stir fried chicken curry instead of the saucy Asian curry I was expecting.

Located in a grocery store plaza, many come by for takeout. You can also sit and eat there as well, as it seats up to 30 people. I'd recommend this place only for a quick takeout order because of the portion size, but the flavor and taste are just average for Chinese food.",xOCTfCwrxTECbGOX6uD_KA,2,0,3,C5nuNG6tuQkygKD_GSn_zg

At one point they had some of the best beef chow fun and it was at a decent price. However, the last couple of times I went here the beef chow fun was sub-par. They cover a lot of their food in either oil or some type of stir fry sauce. Everything seems to be bowled up and thrown into a wok.

The staff is nice so I'll give them points for that.

I can only compare them to other Chinese restaurants to give you some perspective. So far China a Go Go has the best Shrimp and Chicken pad thai and no one has beat them on that. Jacky Chan has the best bbq pork... Rice n Noodle is about neck to neck with Jacky Chan but their items taste very different. They are BETTER than Baidu Bistro and Buffet Asia in terms of quality of ingredients. Larger menu than Panda Express and more authentic.

So,....

The food overall just had a generic taste.  Not worth coming back to.  I'd rather go to Panda Express for greasy, Americanized Chinese food next time.",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,0,0,1,NqkY3i_H1yly_fwbyDMK7w

1.  Reuse returned food item.  Customer's return food items were stored top shelf behind cook and reuse on another to go order.
2.  Left over rice was placed back into the rice warmer for another order. 
3.  Customer did not like their soup, they took it back and dump back to the soup warmer.  
4.  Everybody is in on it from cashier to cook.  

IF you really like their food:
1.  Watch the cook prepare your food in person.
2.  Never order deliver.

If you are in the SW area and is craving delicious, fast, and fairly priced Chinese food, then Rice and Noodle fast food on Rainbow and Windmill in the Smiths shopping center is the place to go. 

Here are the places to avoid (Trust me I've tried all the Chinese fast food places in this area and I've done my research) 
For those of you who are near the
Sunset and Fort Apache don't go to Chung Fai it sucks!
If you are near Blue Diamond and Durango Jacky Chan is ok, but not too much better then Chung Fai.
If you are near Blue Diamond and Buffalo area and is anywhere by XO Chinese food drive pass it and drive fast!
If you are in the Southern Highland area China A Go Go is pretty go just don't be offended if the counter service is far from friendly. I don't remember how the service is at their Durango and Warm Springs location was but the food is the same.

So just skip all those places if you can and save yourself from a bad night of unsatisfying dinner and go straight to Rice and Noodles because there I am never disappointed. 

Everyone has their own favorite and they are mine. Pork chow fun is amazing, Mongolia beef is done right with the crispy white thin noodles on the bottom, Kung Pow chicken is perfectly spicy and flavorful with the right amount of ""cooked"" peanuts (I hate when some places just throw nasty raw unsalted peanut on top) and their apps are all so good. Everything else on their menu is so good. So please try it for yourself and you will see that I didn't not go through all those trial and errors for nothing and just to lie to you. Why would I?",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,10,3,5,M0fnein6jgHjk5UvzvYdsg

I usually get the family special at any Chinese place, and decided to get the Family deal #2 with the Wonton soup, 4 egg rolls, 2 shrimp tempura, Kung Pao combination, Shrimp Chow mein, and the combination fried rice. Also, added two Thai teas. Everything was fresh and tasty, not so heavy, and was enough to feed 4, and came out to under $40.

My only gripe is really about their service. At 9:50 a lady called me to tell me that they were about to close. I told her that we were just about 5 min. away and when we arrived (at 9:52) the two bothered ladies kept staring at us then the owner or manager passive aggressively asked if I had just gotten out of work. I said that I had not, then looked over at the door to check their hours. They close at 10, and we were only there to pick up. By the time I had placed the order it was around 9:30 and she said it would take 15-20 min. which would have put us at 9:45-9:50. It wasn't necessary to call, rush us and then again make her passive aggressive comment to make us feel bad when we were there before they closed. We still left a standard tip even though we were just there for take out.

Overall, I'd give them a 4 star for the food and a 3  star because of poor customer service. The food was good and they didn't forget anything in our order. I'd order from here again, but my advice is to not order past 9:00 PM.",hqTVG-jmbYrw1pFZJa7y7g,1,2,3,peOZCshZjiaSXtCfMKreCQ

The chicken fried rice was so bland soy sauce didn't help not to mention the gummy chicken pieces. I pray it was chicken (yes that bad)

Little did I know that this was more of a hot-table place that served everything in to go boxes. Was I complaining? Not really since it just saved me from boxing everything to go anyway. I'm not that fancy, so I didn't mind the hot-table setting, but I could see how that would bother someone looking for a bit more... ambiance. 

The place almost felt like a mom 'n pop version of Panda Express, except that their food is actually made by people with love, as opposed to a cook following corporate recipes. Not to sound like a Chinese food snob--I actually don't mind Panda Express--but this place seemed like it could be a legit chinese restaurant, but just didn't want to invest in real plates and utensils. 

Anyway, I ordered the kung pao shrimp lunch special ($5.95) which came with some egg drop soup, and fried wonton skins with a sweet dipping sauce. Yum! It was way more food than I was expecting, and I could have easily split it with my perpetually hungry little brother and I would have been okay. The veggies were super fresh and super freshly stir-fried, and the chicken was delicious and just the right amount of spicy. I'm kind of curious as to what their dinners are like. 

I just realized during the writing of this review that Rice N Noodle must have mostly take-out and delivery orders. That would explain their hot-table style of restaurant, because this is some decent food to be had, especially for the location of the surrounding area. I certainly would consider ordering take out if I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for some decent Chinese food.

Cashier/ host guy wasnt so welcoming. As I decided to see what to order, I observed him cleaning up a table. All he did was wipe the mess onto the floor ?! He had no smile or not even an advice on what's good to order. I guess Im use to some kind of "" Aloha "" since I just moved here fr Oahu which he sure didnt have haha & it wasnt busy @ all so some friendliness wouldve been nice. I did  like that it was an open kitchen so I could see my order being made. 
Well .. now on to my food .. I was ordering for my family & didnt want to cook .. I had this craving for Honey Walnut Shrimp .. I wasnt pleased with theirs. The flavor had more of a sweet tart taste .. not the creamy sweet taste Im use too coz the sauce was more watery. Walnuts couldve been more.
Chicken Broccoli .. My son's fav .. Ummm but where the hell is the broccoli ??? .. More like alot of veggies n chicken breast pieces. 
Eggrolls .. another bummer .. excuse me where is the meat ?! STRICTLY CABBAGE !! I paid for egg rolls wrapped with cabbage deep fried !! Really & paid 2/$1.75 so not worth it ( my family never ate it coz it had no flavor or MEAT ! my mom makes better lumpia :) ) 
Beef with onion & ginger .. They sure overloaded this dish with green.onions & ginger. I mean Again Where's The Beef ?! SMH !! 
Combination Chow Mein .. Noodles sure wasnt chow mein but a different type. Combination meant Beef, Chicken & Shrimp .. Well I think there was maybe 2 pieces of shrimp n I dont know how many pieces of beef & chicken. But they got the dish wrong coz WHERE IS THE VEGGIES ?! NONE was in this dish ?! I dont know of any noodle dish esp chow mein where there isnt vegetables.. maybe they stuffed them all.in them eggrolls coz the noodles needed it. 
I spent a total of $ 41 for take out dinner which to me I thought I was bringing home a great Chinese dinner meal.

I do occasionally visit the popular chain during my lunch hour or whenever else I need to grab something fairly quick. I find that popular chain ok. That popular chain is better than Rice and Noodle.

The last time my guy and I went to Rice and Noodle was in early 2013. My guy made note of the dirty light switch and the dirt smudges surrounding that light switch. Spring forward to 2015 and the same dirty light switch. We verified with the picture he had taken in 2013. We had already ordered when we noticed it and decided to stay. My guy wanted to go but I insisted we stay so that we could take advantage of the lunch special and then have dessert at the new hot spot next door.
My guy ordered orange chicken and I ordered... whatever chicken. It was tasteless and forgettable. The rice was soy sauce flavored and the noodles were mushy. We added an order of 2 piece egg roll and that was also forgettable. Whoever prepared it is a fan of black pepper and used way too much. 
I apologized to my guy a few times and I had to treat him to a large dessert next door.

I've been hoping for a better option than our normal go-to's, something with more flavor and less grease. Well, I think we found it and now I'm in real trouble because now I want MORE!

Ordered...
*Combo Chow Mein - Okay, yum, just yum. I'm calling them as soon as they open to order more ... this could become a real problem!
*Shrimp with Snow Peas - Exactly what our group wanted, full of juicy shrimp and veggies galore, dosed in a flavorful broth/sauce, which makes me happy because you gotta have the sauce for the rice, right?!
*Mongolian Beef - Their Mongolian beef does pack a punch with what I'm guessing were dried thai chilis? That was a welcome kick of spice. The dish overall was a 3.5 for me, solid, spiced but lacking something.
*Orange Chicken -  The crowd fave - again - this orange chicken is a bit different than any other recipes that I've tried from other chinese-fast food tyoe locations. Thought it was a bit closer to a sweet n sour, and very yummy. Complete with a mix of broccoli soaking up the sauce on the bottom. Yum!

All orders come with rice, and this is where they lost a star. The rice was dry and kind of blech. Luckily we ordered in, and I was able to make some organic jasmine rice quickly that was fluffy and delish. Their rice game needs work.

I must say, though the rice disappointed, I was doubly impressed that not one container had that stomach turning grease slick, you know, the one you don't see until you've finished your meal and ruins it. 
Their phone service was awesome - I ordered food an hour early and asked them to make everything closer to when we would arrive for pick up- and they did! Food was piping hot and FRESH, veggies still had a slight crunch and the shrimp was cooked to tender. Prices were reasonable, they do offer the family dinner options, also.

Everything is tasty but our all-time faves are the Singapore noodles with plenty variety of meat/seafood and the crab ragoons.  These are best crab ragoons we've tasted anywhere.  they're big, golden crispy with creamy savory insides. Do not forget to try them, you will not regret it! Also love their beef and broccoli, very fresh broccoli  with super tender beef.   one of our fave things to do is order singapore noodles for dinner.  As its so plentiful, we sometimes end up with leftovers but they dont go to waste because they're still delicious the next day. Hubby discovered that if you mix them in your egg scramble you will end up with the most delicious scramble/omelette breakfast meal ever.   My mouth is watering, just thinking of it.

4813857,2017-06-01,0,czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA,"I was on a search for catering services & found that Chinese food was the best priced. Rice n Noodle offers party trays averaging $30-35.

I called in advance asking how much notice they need for a party order, which they said was at least 30 min. prior to when we need it.

My sister's baby shower was on a Sunday at noon & they open at 11 a.m. I tried ordering in advance the night before through Yelp because I thought it'd be easier to put my order in, give delivery address directions, etc. & it'd be one less thing I had to do in the morning.

With orders over $30, $35, $45, they have offers such as ""free entree,"" etc., however, you have to order directly with Rice n Noodle to get the offers they list on their website. I had to cancel my Yelp order & I called them directly to place an order. Apparently, I misunderstood what their offers meant because I thought I got an additional free party entree, but at that point I didn't care anymore & just ordered 3 party trays. I ordered ""Combination Fried Rice"" ($30), ""Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings"" ($30) & Beef Vegetables ($32), with a delivery ($2).

You can either pay with card over the phone & tip when you sign it or you can pay with cash in-person. Although they said it will be delivered in 45-55 min., it came in what seemed to be 20 min. (the location was not far from Rice n Noodle) & I was surprised by that.

They are very quick with making their food & delivering it!

The food was alright! I wanted to take advantage of their website offers, which is why I chose them for catering over other restaurants. I would opt for a different catering service next time.",QSMsF78PxVYiAwwwHeZ7xA,3,2,3,6JprYQhmkSBY-m0IYKTx6g

This review is based on my one time visit, a to go order made last Saturday. We were running errands and was famished by 2 pm. My daughter wanted to visit Desyree (Gelatology is next door) so we decided to grab lunch here first since we've never been. I ordered Orange chicken ($5.95) lunch special to share with her, within 5 minutes our food was ready and we were on our merry way. When we got home, I first tried the fried rice then the chow mein, it was promising. Food was not too oily and tasted okay. Next was the chicken. I'm sorry, but that had to be the worst orange chicken I've ever tasted. I don't know if I was given the wrong order or what but I was not used to eating chicken with soggy breading and doused with super sweet, artificial, non orange tasting red sauce. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be an entr√©e or dessert. I'm not one to waste food but after a couple of bites I gave up, I settled for the rice and chow mein. My daughter wouldn't even touch it and she LOVES orange chicken.

 I want to give this place another chance in the future and will update then because a few of my Yelp friends seem to like this place and I trust their tastes but honestly, not in a hurry as that monstrosity of an orange chicken still haunts me.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,7,2,2,6Bo-qbDdPnDFbzns6jPxxw

Today the chicken fried rice was basically just fried rice with a few scraps of chicken and the same with the green bean chicken it was a huge container of string beans with scraps of chicken. The mushu shrimp had a fowl stench so we didn't even touch it. However we started eating the green bean chicken until we both realized there was hardly any chicken! Lol. So we never are one to call and complain but we figured since we are such loyal customers they would help us out. 

All we asked for was for them to credit are account. We didn't even want our money back. We just wanted a credit and we were loyal to them and figured maybe they were just having an off day and figured if we hit a credit we could give them another chance. They told us they would send a driver to come pick up the food. So the driver gets here and opens up the food and inspects the food and then calls his manager. The manager didn't want to credit us because he said we ate some of the string bean chicken.... well of course we did we were searching for the chicken!!

There were no other options so I buckled down to wait and I'm glad I did.

The food prices seemed a bit high to me for your basic take-out Chinese food, but is was no Panda Express. As I waited for almost a half hour, I watched the bustling kitchen in an almost choreographed precision of constant kitchen activity. The chefs never stopped moving, 2-3 of them cooked non stop and the woman at the front answered phones, took orders from inside and out and helped to fill the take out orders. They all did this while still being very kind and courteous to those who waited so long for huge orders of food to feed families, no doubt. No one seemed angry to be waiting for their food, they too were patient and understanding.

So, I was impressed with how hard they worked Christmas night, but how was the food? Honestly I had low expectations for such a busy night but damn if it wasn't perfect! Decent portion of fluffy shrimp fried rice (they apologized for running out of egg) with plenty of good-sized, fresh shrimp! The General Tso chicken was also delicious with fresh, colorful vegetables, a nice kick of spice with the dried red peppers and high quality lean chicken meat. They included free steamed rice and handed it to me with a smile. Needless to say, I'm incredibly impressed and they will get my business over Panda Express any day from now on.",4zCEuRL-vK_9867DTuJsjQ,0,0,5,TAIEMLu48T3cocfkMscTyg

5199334,2010-08-14,8,czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA,"The Rice n I got off to a bad start. The first three things I encountered were disappointments:

1. They do not have a lunch special that comes with tofu. I asked just to see if maybe they could do tofu for a lunch special, and the answer was no. The $6 price tag on the mixed veggie special was higher than I have seen elsewhere where you do get tofu.
2. They do not have brown rice. 
3. The egg drop soup was thickened with so much cornstarch that it was more like a porridge than a soup. 

Given these three things, recovery into the 3-star zone was going to be a tough thing to accomplish, and sadly, the mixed veggies in a light garlic sauce did not earn the third star. For my personal taste, there was simply too much sauce, and the sauce was salty. Maybe I was in a ""mood,"" but I couldn't bring myself to eat more than a couple of bites.

On a positive note or two, there was definitely garlic, which was nice because sometimes garlic sauce is just a white sauce with little to no flavor. The vegetables were fresh. The staff was young and friendly. The place was clean with an open kitchen allowing you to witness the woking up of your order.

Still, I was disheartened by my tofu free, saucy lunchtime experience.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,5,2,8Gtvo2Oi3-JggT5v1ze9rQ

5794617,2015-08-16,0,czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA,i am an east coast nyc chinese fan. i wanted to try some las vegas chinese and i was pleasantly surprised. i had the gen tso chicken. some really good heat out of it. i had the appetizer of sliced bbq pork. delicious. reminded me of ny/nj. the friend rice could have been a little crispier but had a good almost buttery taste and seemed to be a different type of rice than the east coast. egg rolls were alright. but I'm spoiled and nothing compares to a nyc egg roll. all in althea were polite fast and eager to answer any questions i had. id def go back!,FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,0,0,4,Kgm1wv6eZoDs5FBMwEc6zA

I've ordered pepper steak, garlic chicken, sweet and sour chicken, wonton soup, crab Rangoon's, chicken wontons, shrimp tempura, and shrimp fried rice.  All very good food.  I don't have anything to compare it to but I don't really want to.",2Z4Z8dddBb9wT6f9-ZdSaA,0,0,5,d03fPQ4MagJnRyoL96Gg1Q

5854984,2015-07-01,1,czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA,I ordered the general tso house special chicken and it's really good. Nice portion size and good spice. And I like mild to spicy dishes. I also orders the beef chow fun. Also a good portion size. There lunch specials is really good for the price that you get for it  if you want something other than Panda Express but better portion size and better price get the lunch specials. They are worth it.,a8lfRW4aQBHX1RBB4Z4VmQ,2,1,4,WnsxBInmvd4z7vgJzJYK6A

The quality of the food is MUCH better than the place we normally order from. The food is extremely flavorful. It was money worth spending!

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that their food was actually super yummy! The food comes out really quick, like probably less than 10 mins every time. 

My absolute favorite dish here is the HOT GARLIC CHICKEN. YAS, it is sooo satisfying and the best thing is that the lunch special is only about $7. I've also tried the eggplant with tofu and orange chicken which is pretty good as well. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area!",yP4Xs0pRH8Uqn-BaEOmJFA,0,0,5,pG19nGPOuFWcZ9UVx_xA9Q

5959771,2011-06-24,2,czyhvf93Txsfxdxqcm16mA,"Great little place to get takeout or delivery. 

As we walked up at 9:30pm last night, I noticed the sign on the door that clearly states that they close at 9:30. We were about to turn around when the workers waved us in. I'm already impressed. 

The portions are enormous for the price and pretty tasty. My fella wasn't a fan of the overuse of onions in his pad thai, but as an onion fiend I ate all of his and mine as well. 

I had the chow fun with chicken. Good flavors and not too greasy. I had plenty left over for lunch the next day.

I'll definitely be back or heck, I might order delivery next time. The lunch specials look cheap as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,2,4,HDQiTABqdly24XN7o0SA9A
