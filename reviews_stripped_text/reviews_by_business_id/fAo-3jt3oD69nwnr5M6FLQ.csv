The food is delicious Americanized Chinese food at 2-3x the price of your local delivery joint.  It is not exotic.  It will not be a new cultural experience.  You will not leave your comfort zone.  It is just Americanized Chinese food done very, very right.

The entrees are pretty large and good for sharing.  My girlfriend and I shared one mu-shu pork and a fried rice and were perfectly full.  It was our anniversary, and they gave us an (awesome) free dessert after dinner.  Our total including tax + tip was under $60.  

Next time i'll probably go with 4 people and all share 3 entrees and a rice or noodle dish plus a dessert or two.  We had the peking duck tasting menu here last year, and it was just okay -- too much of the same ingredient IMHO.

This place will be a must-go on every subsequent vegas trip.",PLc0_CtEWEQvbztwZ5lZbg,3,3,5,EyknetGU1mjd9688DOHUfw

Started at the bar with some mai thais and talked with the bartender.  Very friendly staff and great decor.  she was telling us all about the paintings in the room and about the pomegranite trees that are 100 years old in the dining room.

now to the good stuff, had a sizzling rice soup that tasted like it was out of a can.  That was theh only bad part my whole night.  also had some spring rolls, shrimp bread and bbq spare ribs.  shrimp bread was very tasty and i would recommend it to anyone.  entrees consisted of walnut shrimp, general tso chicken and the pork chops.    chicken had a nice kick to it.

My boyfriend and I ordered a ton of food.  I though the pot stickers were amazing! Everything else was good to eh. Vegetable fried rice was good-but nothing amazing. Everything else, I wouldn't recommend. The lemon chicken I ate one piece and that was more then enough.

We were recently in Shanghai and we're hoping this would be more authentic however, it was pretty standard. 

The service was excellent. They brought out a tiny chair for my purse to be placed. 5 star service for sure.

The restaurant has one of the most interesting and beautiful designs I have had the pleasure of dining at. The majority of the food is excellent and would highly recommend the crispy pork belly and the seafood corn egg drop soup. The BBQ spare ribs were good but nothing unique and the crispy crab spring rolls I would skip. The wok tossed scallops were the highlight of the dinner followed by the Peking duck. The three cup sea bass was unique and enjoyable. The garlic beef tenderloin was very tender but lacked flavor and I would skip. The service started out excellent but hit a few hiccups throughout the meal. We completed our bottle of wine and would have ordered a second but were never asked. Water glasses also sat empty for extended periods. Overall a very good dinner and experience that I would recommend.,yLCsv3QheMmnZJyKgDdSqg,0,1,4,FhptzIJ4D6hAvtYidrmKfQ
331119,2009-08-08,3,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"First of all, not worth it at all ESPECIALLY ordering the chef's signature tasting menu which cost about 100 a pop. To start, we received a beautiful cut of hamachi sashimi with ponzu sauce and jalapenos on a bed seaweed. Now, I like starting off my meal with sashimi but at a chinese restaurant? They say they are french influenced but sashimi with ponzu sauce still doesn't make sense! However, I admit the sashimi was delicious although they put on a bit too much ponzu sauce.

Second, I received two pan-fried duck rolls which were the highlight of the entire night. They basically just took their peking duck and peking duck pancakes and rolled up the duck with cilantro and shallots. The cilantro was delicious inside and a very nice flavor but again, wheres the Chinese or even French influence?! the plating was minimal, simply the two duck rolls with a sweet thick sauce resembling a hosin sauce drizzled on top.

Third, I got a grouper wrapped a few times in a paper made from rice. It was good but had a very thick sauce accompanying it that you just couldn't get rid off.

Fourth was a pallet cleanser of lychee sorbet. Just a spoonful of sorbet on a plate with a mint leaf. This really had me asking why i just laid down $100 for this dinner. After finishing this in about 3 bites, i received the worst course ever.

Fifth was simply awful and suddenly reminded me of denny's and panda express combined. I received a korabuta pork chop which should've delicious but was terribly overcooked and almost completely dry inside. The whole thing was drenched in a terribly sweet and thick sweet and sour sauce which reminded me exactly of panda's orange chicken sauce. On the side was some bok choy and grilled pineapple...I really considered sending this back but figured I'd only eat a little bit and go out to get some decent food afterward.

Last was dessert which was a random assortment of awful desserts. The only decent was was an awkwardly small dish of coconut pudding on a huge plate to fit the assortment of desserts. Next to it was a spoonful of standard mango sorbet. There were some sour berries to the side and finally a large cup/bowl of rice pudding covered with a layer of guava jam and topped with diced kiwi, cantaloupe, and pineapple (random, I know). The rice pudding was bad, the guava terribly sweet and the fruit on top wasn't ripe so it left a very sour taste in my mouth.

All in all, if i had received the first 3 courses twice, I wouldve given this place 4 stars  so I recommend if you are in vegas save your money and go to Joel Robuchon in the MGM and not the Latellier directly next to it. They recently started 2,3,4, and 6 course tasting menus that include the famous bread and homemade dessert carts starting from 100 to about 160, definitely worth it and of course they menu de degustacion for about 350 or so.",E29dl4AmlW-lsexUxsKJGw,0,0,2,L-FlNSKaa0PaX50oC692rg
361420,2011-06-26,4,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"My husband and I tried the 2 six dish tasting menus (the signature tasting menu and the Peking duck tasting menu). Doing the tasting hopefully gets us a wide variety of dishes to sample as well as trying what the restaurant is most proud of. The first two courses of each were excellent - vegetable dim sum and a tofu and crab cake and Peking duck on traditional buns and a duck salad with truffle vinaigrette. However, after that the quality went down hill dramatically. The duck menu had a greasy lo mein main dish that was no higher quality than any lo mein you get at your local restaurant and one dessert was just chocolate mousse (at a Michelin star Asian restaurant?!). 

The service in general was good but as the meal went on and the restaurant became more busy they became less and less attentive. The general atmosphere was nice, especially if you can get a table by the garden, however of the 4 chairs at our table, 2 had pieces missing and creaked uneasily. I would rate the place higher if it weren't so expensive. If you're spending that much money go to a place with better overall food.",Tc4YYu3Ii8Cd0uwxfmqxCA,0,0,2,t5hbZXXG4uNj6rYPwRDJvQ

Appetizers were very good with the hot and sour seafood soup excellent and the shrimp spring rolls very good. But we come for the entrees. And just two in particular. The Sampan Prawns and the Peking Duck. Prawns were as we remembered and excellent. Large, plump, perfectly fried and a flavor bomb perfectly spiced.  The Peking Duck first course, awesome as usual. However they have changed the second course of the duck. And I am sure it has everything to do with $. In the past the duck brought back to the kitchen after the pancakes were presented and the meat removed from the bones. It was then stir fried with veggies and put into lettuce leaf cups and served. Now all they do is bring the duck back to the kitchen and chop the carcass into small pieces and returned to the table. Nothing very adventurous or exciting. We did return Sunday night thinking it may have been a one off but sure enough, same chopped duck (we also ordered the moo shu pork this night and it was excellent).

Wing Lei is a Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant in the Wynn Casino that recently underwent an interior makeover. The inside is wide open, brightly lit and covered over in gold, white and green colors. 

The Cocktails:  My dirty Bombay martini came out fast and cold with just the right amount of olive juice ($15.50).  They have a large wine list and many 'by the glass' options.  

The Food: We started off with crab spring rolls ($19) and potstickers ($16).  The three spring rolls were filled mainly with crab meat. While the crab tasted ok, there was little else besides crab in the roll to give it texture or crunch and the rolls ended up tasting a bit mushy.  The four potstickers came with a side of sauce and were perfectly pan seared without being greasy.  For dinner, we shared the whole Peking duck ($98) and a side of yang chow fried rice ($16).  The cooked duck was brought out on a rolling cart and carved tableside. While still at the table, the waiter assembled the duck rolls using crepes (like in a moo-shu dish) rather than the more traditional steamed buns.  I've read on other people's reviews that you supposedly have a choice between the two, but we weren't given one.  When done, the waiter wheeled the duck carcass back into the kitchen so a second dish could be prepared from the remaining meat.  The second dish came out about 10 minutes later and consisted of a plate of six lettuce cups filled with a mixture of finely diced duck meat and vegetables.  Both forms of the duck were delicious and enough for two people.  The fried rice was plentiful but average. 

Tip: If you order the whole Peking duck, ask how the second duck serving is going to be prepared as it is not always lettuce cups.  Once when I was there, the second duck dish was a noodle stir fry with pieces of the duck meat, which was very tasty. However, friends have told me their second dish was just chopped up chunks of cooked duck, bones and all, served with a side of sauce.  Perhaps it depends on the chef's mood that night but there is nothing wrong in asking beforehand so there are no unpleasant surprises.

The service is excellent and the food comes out quickly. They always seem to have a high number of waiters hurrying back and forth so you never have to wait long if you need something.  While the taste of the food holds its own in comparison to other Chinese restaurants off the strip, the price is a different story. Wing Lei is located in a big name casino on the strip and that, together with a Michelin star, demands loftier prices.  Keeping that in mind, if you don't want to travel off the strip and/or you want the whole elegant setting, fine dining experience, I think Wing Lei is an excellent choice.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,5,2,4,NfPw2oL29lGH3Bp-KfNSLw

WHAT NO FORTUNE COOKIE?

Just for the holidays, until Jan 2, Wing Lei opens for lunch as a dim sum buffet at a price of $58.88. At first we were put off. Overpriced in comparison to Chinatown SF. Since we had a $600 dining credit to use before leaving we decided to try it. 

Am I glad we did! We expected all-you-can-eat dim sum. Well it was that and the best I've ever had but another surprise was that it was also a real buffet which is worth the premium price.

White glove service on white linen tablecloth in plush chairs set the interior atmosphere. For the exterior, a relaxing view of an enclosed courtyard. Service - an employee overheard wife wondering to me if they had a certain dessert. They sent someone over to answer the question. 

Hours:     11 AM - 3 PM
Adults:      $58.88
Children:  $38.88
THIS IS A GOURMET RESTAURANT SO DON'T EXPECT DRINKS TO BE INCLUDED
Sodas:     $4
Tea:          $11/person (I put this in here specifically for those expecting tea to be included. We found out the hard way but we were charged $5/person because we had been there the day before & brought friends.)

Noteworthy items - Buffet
Lobster
Crab
Lamb one day/ prime rib the next
Duck
Napa cabbage

Noteworthy items - Dim Sum
Char shui bow (Best ever)
Lobster dumpling 
Shark fin dumplings (which we refused)
Shu Mai with truffle topping

We went twice. The second day we brought guests: one local & 4 from LA -- all used to gourmet Chinese. The opinion of all was that it was exceptional dim sum with some items being the best ever. As for the buffet, I prepped my guests about what to expect. Everyone had  lobster & crab noting both were exceptional. Even though the price far exceeded other premium buffets, the quality and service added so much value that it more than made up for the additional price.

This place has two dishes I get every time I'm here, the shrimp toast and the Peking duck.  The shrimp toast is golden brown and crunchy, and you can actually taste the shrimp flavor and texture in it.  The Peking duck the bring out for your inspection, and then they carve part of it table side for you, which is fun to watch.  The then take it back to the kitchen to carve the rest up, before bringing it back out for you so don't worry.  It is both rich and flavorful and moist, and not a lot of fat on the duck as it should be.  And mostly importantly, the skin is CRISPY!

612999,2016-08-22,0,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"We were disappointed about our experience at Wing Lei Thursday, 08/18/2016.

We stayed at Wynn hotel and I was informed the ""Business Casual"" dress code in the fine dinning restaurants at Wynn is ""no shorts, T-shirt acceptable"" so my husband and son wore T-Shirts and jeans. At the reception, the hosts did not allow my husband and son (13 years old) to get in unless they change something with collars. My husband and son went back to our hotel room changing into shirts and came back. Sigh, off the great start!

Because of my son's birthday, we ordered two order of special dish ""Buddha Jumps Over the Wall"" with abalone, sea cucumber, goose foot and fish belly, thinking it must tastes superb with such an impressive price. We were very disappointed at Wing Lai, because it is a dish that can really show the chef's experience and reputation, but when we saw the presentation and started to taste it, we lose the appetite. My husband did not even finish his dish and my son asked me to finish his order. The flavor was not fully absorbed inside the abalone and it was even hard to cut. If Ah Yat Abalone is the university level, the Wing Lai is about 6-7 grade level. The sea cucumber was, just sea cucumber, nothing special at all, the goose foot and fish belly are very common with nothing special at all. In my opinion, any Cantonese seafood restaurant in LA can serve equally or better ""Buddha Jumps Over the Wall"" dish. This is really at most a one star dish, so sorry.

However the Imperial Peking Duck is the best duck I had ever have in the United States and probably can be the No.1 Peking duck I had ever had. The skin is crispy yet not too greasy. The flavor is well balanced. I am willing to finish a whole duck by myself, even if it means I will gain three pounds, I am willing. The duck is a must order dish, a 5 stars, or 5.5 stars if they can serve more steam buns. 

We also ordered the crab with salt and pepper style, we are satisfied. It is very flavorful and crunchy outside yet the crab meat was still tender inside. We will give it a 4.5 stars.

We also ordered Sautéed Mixed Vegetables, too salty that I did not even ask my husband and son to taste it, if you add black bean sauce, please don't add more salt to make the dish even more salty. Yang Chow Fried Rice was dry and flavorless, using my son's description that he uses to describe college cafeteria food, it is ""sand paper"" like. I can merely give those two dishes 1.5 stars.  Really, any Cantonese restaurants in LA can make equal or better ones than Wing Lai. 

We order green tea/red bean ice cream and lychee/passion fruit sorbet for dessert. The passion fruit sorbet was so heavenly that I almost forget the bad ""Buddha Jumps Over Wall"" dish. 

We love the gentlemen who served us, they were friendly and professional. The lady who carved the duck at the table was sweet with great skills. They made the Wing Lai experience somewhat pleasant. Do I recommend Wing Lai? Just come and order the duck and the crab. The rest? Not worthy enough, don't know how the Michelin one star is earned.",7gA6hBOdSINhhy1i1qiF2w,0,0,2,OIyxDFZqbKa19R4fFXD1tQ

I have very high standards when it comes to Chinese food since the ONLY place I will usually go is the Peking Gourmet Inn outside of DC, where the Peking Duck reigns supreme.  My husband and I decided to order the duck tasting menu.

 We were excited when they first rolled out the whole duck to the table, as it looked like what we would normally expect for Peking Duck.  But as they started to carve the duck our outlook changed greatly. They didn't separate the skin from the meat, leaving all the fat trapped in between. They then cut four pieces to be divided between two pancakes each, only to wheel away the remainder of the bird. We watched in horror as it went back into the kitchen. The duck itself was fatty and flavorless, the pancakes fell apart before you could get them into your mouth. 

The next course was duck salad, which while beautifully packaged was boring to taste and lacked flavor. It was wrapped in a wonton casing which while you could eat, but was also 100% flavorless. The third course was duck wonton soup - it had a great smoky flavor to the broth, but lacked any real duck meat. Finally, the last two courses, duck chow mein and wok fried duck were also flavorless which seemed to be the theme for the evening.

The food felt as if it was ""dumbed down"" for a boring American audience. If this is the ""best"" Chinese in Vegas, they obviously don't know good Chinese food.",7mxFW1V7i81LHdIqlfSNsg,2,1,2,ArqJUJ8MF6_F_RgYuiHOWg

The stand-outs were the Peking Duck Salad and the ask-your-waiter-secret-menu Beef Tenderloin prepared with ginger and scallion. Opinions were split on the Ma Po tofu which evoked notes of American style chili for some. 

Even if you are full and can't possibly eat more, make room for the cherry/black tea mousse dessert.  I would make an excuse just to come back for dessert.

Mu shu pork which was very yummy and fried rice which was very oily and average tasting. All in all I felt the food wasn't a lot different than most much cheaper Chinese restaurants. 
They gave us a beautiful desert plate at the end, and a beautifully boxed cake to take home. Very nice touch. 
I think we will go back and try some different dishes next time while staying at the Wynn as my husband and I are very much about atmosphere. And this place certainly delivers that.

WONDERFUL service
AMAZING menu

Especially wonderful were: the crab spring rolls, the hot and sour soup, and the sea bass entre. 

My only complaint: We were a quiet table of 3, and we were seated next to a very loud, very obnoxious party of 12 young people having a very loud, drunken time... This was our one splurge meal on our vacation, and this loud annoying group really ruined it for us. We couldn't even have a conversation at our table  because of how loud they were. Please, next time there is such a group, seat them in one of your fine private rooms on the side of the restaurant- they will be more comfortable, and the rest of your guests will really appreciate it.",5ufXAWf50X4IlORgHZOK3g,2,2,4,MhUalGFaZZTNSXagOf9NAg

Overwhelmed with the taste of citrus, he couldn't finish the dish. Good chow mein and fried rice.

974177,2010-12-04,10,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"I should have known better. I had read the Yelp reviews saying the food wasn't as good as what you could get at other ""normal"" Chinese restaurants. I was foolish, and had to see to believe it. I mean, this place used to be Michelin rated! It's at the Wynn, I would think Steve Wynn would want to appease all the Asian high rollers who flock to his casinos! So I went, with boyfriend, father and mother in tow.

Well, it was a really, really lame way to blow close to $300.

The order:

Lobster
Peking duck (served two ways)
Some veggie dish
3 cup sea bass (I forget if this is the actual name of the dish)
4 bowls of white rice ($5 each bowl = $20 for friggin' white rice for crying out loud)

None of the dishes were bad, quality wise everything was good (as in, normal Chinese restaurant good), and the Peking duck was outstanding. We just felt jipped. For the Peking duck, it was sooo tasty. Well, all 4 tiny slices that they give you. They then take the rest of the duck away. Where is the rest of the duck I just paid $80 for?  ""It's being made into duck shu mai"" the waitress said.

Well -- they brought the shu mai out, and I highly DOUBT it was made with the duck we just ate. Very small pieces of duck in the shu mai, that tasted pre-made, overly salty and not very good. And there was practically a WHOLE peking duck leftover that they took away. Where is the rest of that glorious, glorious duck?? A lady at the table next to us was now chewing a Peking duck leg. I'm pretty sure that's where our duck went. SHADY!!!  

(If you order duck at this place, I suggest asking that you just eat the duck as is with the bread, onions and hoisin sauce, and DON'T get the shu mai. See if they'll let you keep the whole duck! We should have asked for this!)

So we felt pretty screwed. I mean the $20 for white rice was the nail in the coffin. We could have gotten a fried rice dish at least for less than that. Thanks for the heads up, idiot waiter!

1086774,2010-03-29,1,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"Great drinks, food, and service, but the atmosphere is a bit odd.

It's one big, ornate room with lots of tables, but it seems more like an extravagantly-decorated hotel conference room than a restaurant.  I bit overstated/indulgent on the decor for my tastes, but still nice.  I liked the chopsticks on the table, as they had heavy gold ends and had a great weight to them.

For food:
Had the vegetable springrolls to start, and they were average.  There was nothing separating these from the spring rolls you'd get at any other chinese restaurant, except these were more than 2x more expensive.
Hot and Sour soup was also forgettable/unremarkable, and had the same consistency I am used to from hot and sour in Chinatown.

For entrees, we got the Mongolian Beef and the Kung Pao Chicken.  The beef was seasoned very well, was tender (not chewy or rubbery), and had a very hearty and aromatic garlic soy reduction glaze.  It wasn't as good the next day eating leftovers, and everything took on a very sticky, mushy consistency, but hot-out-of-the-kitchen, it was delicious.
The chicken was of very high quality, and was tossed ith peanuts, bell pepper, scallions and garlic in a ginger chili sauce.  Again, the sauce and the well-preparedness of the meat really made the dish.  The spiciness of the sauce was not one-note as you sometimes find in Kung Pao sauces, but had layers and depth.  It didn't just scorch your palete with a blast of peppery damage like some Kung Paos do.  It was rather well-composed.

The drinks were tasty, albeit a bit weak (though one weak-cocktail is enough for me).  I had a delicious cocktail made with some thai-milky-tea, and it came garnished with thai basil and a bamboo stick.  It was delicious and I would orer it again.

Overall:
I would venture to say that the apps are overpriced and nothing special, so I don't consider them a good value.  The entrees, though a bit pricey, were well-cooked and had delicious glazes/sauces, and they were above-par for chinese food I've had.  The service is impeccible, and the decor, while not really my taste, did create an upscale-chinese look/feel.

I would go back, yes, but probably not until I've tried the other fine dining options at the Wynn first.",eLOliEa71F4o0P39lWuk9g,4,4,4,q9TjMQHFLqzHApvY64VWCw

We were seated at the private dining room at the end of the restaurant.  It's an amazing dining space.  Beautiful decor and you can hear each other, even across the huge round table.

To start, we were served 6 dishes of cold plates and appetizers.  Braised pig's ear, beef shanks, jellyfish, abalone, tofu skin, and several others all prepared in ways that reflect different Chinese cuisine, from Shanghai to Szechuan.  

When the soup arrived, I was just blown away.  The servers walked in with individual coconut bowls and in it was Shark Fin Chicken Soup.  It was crazy since they used shark fin like it was vermicelli noodles or something.  The whole soup was just the pure essence of chicken soup with an incredible amount of shark fin.

Next the main dishes came out and each dish was done extremely well: Braised Kobe Beef, Ginger Chicken, Bok Choy, Garlic & Sprouts, Braised eggplant, Pan-fried Golden Prawns, Steamed Whole Black Cod, Stir-fry Minced Pork, Fried Geoduck, and Fried Rice with an assortment of Chinese sausages, bbq items for you to add.  The Kobe beef was the best since it was done so well and it seriously felt like it would just melt in your mouth.  The black pepper sauce goes so well with the peppers and the beef.  I just wish they gave us more haha.

The fried rice is an interesting way of serving it since you can add whatever kind of meat to your rice.  Also when you do black cod right, it is one of the best fish ever, and the chefs at Wing Lei did an amazing job.

The meal ended with a fruit platter.  Its got the usual like watermelon, stawberries, and pineapple, but it also had FRESH lychee!  You usually can't find fresh lychee but damn it was good.

The bill?  $700... PER PERSON.  Needless to say... that is the most expensive meal I'll probably ever eat in my entire life and thank goodness we were treated by a partner.  Just the shark fin soup itself was $200.  Craziness.

The wait staff is attentive and even picked out a red wine that goes well with our menu.  Usually it is hard to find a wine to go well with Chinese food but they've done it.  There's a full bar in the restaurant with Chinese beer that you can't find at the other parts of Wynn, as well as special cocktails.  

Overall, the meal was amazing and I can definitely see why it was Michelin rated in 2009.  The chefs here do an amazing job and it really does reflect Chef Yu's mastery in blending Cantonese, Shanghai, and Szechuan cuisine.  I took a look at the menu and definitely wouldn't mind coming back and trying out the Peking Duck Tasting myself next time.",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,9,9,5,ZmwDvRr--zVfzvR7kHukzg

Due to a canceled flight, we arrived 1.5 hrs late for our reservation, but the host was very accommodating and sat us, even though it was nearly 10pm.  The service was excellent, very attentive without being overbearing, and quick with requests.  

If I was only rating the food, I would give it 3.5 stars.  We had the pot sticker appetizer, which was very good. We ordered the Peking duck for the main course.  The duck itself was excellent, but the accompaniments could be improved. The pancakes were too thick and not large enough to roll/fold  around the duck, which resulted in a slightly messy situation... the duck would fall out and the plum sauce drip. The second course of the duck, the lettuce cups, also needed to be larger to wrap around the duck.

The dessert, a brownie, was very good but a tad too rich. The presentation was beautiful, though.  

I would recommend this restaurant for someone looking for a solid Chinese food experience, but it is not ""knock your socks off"".  It is a bit pricey, but then again it is what the market will bear.",VzNE5U_T7vtia6VBvSVzUg,0,0,4,jytwr1Tya2RifXZvzrfgEQ

As a former Hawaii and Los Angeles resident, I consider myself fully rooted in Chinese food. The service is spectacular and I love the little stool they brought out for my purse to sit on.
Started off with an order of the dumplings, or potstickers. They were good, the skins were on the thin side and the meat insides were moist. As a table we shared our entrees. We got the peeking duck, tofu and bok choy, salt and pepper prawns, chicken, and garlic noodles. The peeking duck was quite the experience. They brought out the duck whole, just to show the full creature before taking it back to cut it up. They then returned to wrap individual duck, onion, and pancake (tortilla like) mini wraps. I would note though that I'd prefer almost to do it myself. Then people can add and subtract the ingredients you like. Everything was very flavorful and consistent. When you go to a Michelin star establishment, it'll be more for the atmosphere. I didn't feel like the food was really anything special.

The restaurant was very nice with a jade-like green color scheme accenting the white/ivory color of everything else. There is a huge gold dragon outside of the ceiling height glass windows on one side of the restaurant. To make it more Chinese, all the prices ended with 8's. Lol 

The ""adults"" did all the ordering so we just sat and waited. They had told they some had to go to a concert soon so I believe the restaurant may have expedited cooking our table's food. Besides the ones listed below, there was also some veggies... but that's irrelevant right? HAHA 

Alaskan King Crab Salad w/ Mango, avocado, miso-yuzu dressing. Stacked with a ring mold, there are large lumps of crab on top of mango and avocado layers. Very simple, clean tasting appetizer. 

Pacific Red Cod w/ choice of steamed style w/ ginger & scallions or black bean sauce - Large fresh fish. Good texture. Yummy steamed fish. Great with rice ! 

Fried Prawns w/ Candied Walnuts, romaine lettuce, and creamy kalamansi honey sauce - wait romaine lettuce? wot? Lol where was this? but the prawns were HUGE ! Even for me, was a 2-biter haha XD 

Garlic Beef Tenderloin w/ heirloom bell peppers, sugar peas, seasonal mushrooms, black pepper sauce - SUPER tender tenderloin ""logs"" with garlic chips. Yum. I don't recall the other stuff hehe 

Imperial Peking Duck carved tableside w/ a choice of steamed buns or mandarin crepes, cucumber, scallions, hoisin sauce. Typical peking duck, brought to the table whole on a cart, and carved. The adults picked mandarin crepes. My friend thought of duck quesadillas and that made us go mmmmm.... sounded like a good idea. I've had both crepe and bun styles before. I much prefer the bun. Skin was carved off for the buns with a small layer of meat. The rest of the meat/carcass is cut to bite size pieces. 

Wok-Tossed Scallops w/ brussels sprouts, onion, sugar peas, heirloom bell peppers, black bean sauce. HUGE whole scallops. Type where you'd need like a knife and fork to portion out to eat. Lol ! Overall, the scallops were cooked perfectly. No chewy aspects at all. Very tender. Not much of a fan of scallops to begin with but they tasted nice.  

Overall, the food was decent. Not for the price paid but the food was good. I've ate at Michelin star Chinese restaurants before, and supposedly this was a Michelin starred restaurant at some point, but it's quite different. Service was very attentive, with everyone wearing white gloves.

And Red 8 is about 2x-3x cheaper.....and trust me, Red 8 is not known to be a ""great"" restaurant....just a quick stop to get a couple asian dishes, have a few beers, and then go out.

Wing Lei is no different from the typical Chinese restaurant anywhere in the country.  Look, if I want to get mediocre Chinese food, there's one on every block in the Bay Area.  I suppose they wanted to have a ""upper-end"" Chinese restaurant in Vegas, so they got the hype machine working.  Wynn, the whole asian thing, Michelin ratings, etc, etc.  I hate to compare any Chinese establishment to Panda Express, but honestly, Wing Lei is near that level.  Ok, ok, maybe I have a more dour opinion on the place because it's 4-5x more expensive than your average Chinese restaurant...I know, I know, it's Vegas.  But honestly, the food is mediocre!  

Look, I so wished this place kicked ass.....I wish there was some fantastic, spectacular Chinese restaurant in Vegas that absolutely blew all the other Chinese restaurants away.  I wish the cuisine was so divine, that I could sit back and say to myself, ""wow, now THAT's the difference between a great Chinese restaurant and a spectacular one....I always wanted to see what that would taste like, and now I know"".

I'll admit I played it safe and ordered something I knew.  It tasted just like it did in the midwest.  Which is highly disappointing.  I went here for something special.  Instead I got something that tasted like my favorite take out back home.  Only the price was inflated 5 fold.  Each of us had a drink, entree, rice, and shared a dessert, $150, after tip.

The service is first-rate - the waiter was attentive, all while staying in the background, and you could hardly take a sip of water without someone running over to refill your glass.

And the food was perfect.  My guest and I enjoyed a perfectly prepared moo shu pork, a mind-blowing whole deep-friend Dungeness crab, and a ridiculous lobster in Szechuan (sp?) sauce.  Sure, I made myself a greasy mess from picking apart crab for a half hour, but it was so worth it.

I got my wish and immediately upon arriving we were delighted by the decor and attentive service.  Most of the higher end dining places in the Wynn have the charming little lounges for handbags.  You can even buy them at the Wynn Home Store for $500 USD.  Our waiter was helpful and made us feel very welcome.  It's disappointing that the food did not live up to what you'd expect for the price or the Michelin star rating (awarded 9 years ago). It was beautifully presented, but the chicken dish we ordered was dry and chewy, the pork belly dish was very salty and in general, everything we ordered tasted like it was made by your grandma, not a high end chef.

As for the food and drinks. Yes, very expensive. Worth it? Sure if you don't mind paying for hella expensive Chinese food that is SLIGHTLY better than good (in terms of taste) and you're out celebrating some momentous occasion. But I wouldn't eat here on a regular basis. I've definitely had SO much better Chinese out in the the Bay Area in CA for SOOO much cheaper. Here are my thoughts on the items we picked out that night. 

Drinks: Decent Sake selection--the boyfriend chose one it was heated. Very good. However, we didn't get to finish it and our server told us we couldn't take the rest home. He explained that they didn't have a liquor license for the unfinished remains to leave the restaurant unless it was in another glass? uh...this was weird considering that all the other fine dining restaurants I've been able to go to in Vegas had allowed us to bring our unfinished drinks outside...

As for myself I got a glass of white wine which was nothing particularly special. 

Vegetable springs rolls: You can totally tell these were made with the freshest, best quality vegetables. The sauces were super fresh and tasty. 

Crab and Corn Egg drop soup: Great consistency, flavor a bit on the bland side. Enough crab meat was available in the soup.

Vegetable Fried Rice: Used highest quality ingredients. Not very flavorful; possibly more on the bland side.

The best dish of the night was their Peking Duck. The server assistants cuts it right next to you, and prepares the pieces into your steamed buns. Hoisen sauce was right amount of salt, sweet and tart. The buns were fresh and steaming. The scallions and cucumber were fresh. It was a bit hard to believe that the rest of the Peking Duck would be used for shui mai. The Peking Duck shui mai were meaty and juicy, but I think I would have preferred having the whole Peiking duck instead of putting it in two courses.

We started with some of the chef delivered starters (a gogi berry tea and a ginger and pear dish) as well as split an order of the pan-seared pot stickers. They were artfully plated and we had the traditional sauce as well as a spicy house chili sauce to go with them. We then split the garlic beef tenderloin (cooked perfectly with a lovely black pepper sauce for flavor) and General Tao's chicken (nice and spicy with artfully presented Bok Choy). To accompany them, we had a side of steamed Jasmine rice. We split a dessert - chocolate dome over petifores, which was good (and then they brought us some delightful mini petifores as well afterwards).

Wine pairing $45/pp

ONE duck, tableside carving for the FIRST course: 
Duck crepes- their duck version of mu shu, deliciously crisp, loved the yellow chives
Duck soup, good, colorful julienned veggies but I didn't like the soggy duck skin floating in the broth.  Just the meat please!
Duck egg noodles-reminds me of any other mid-range noodle dish.
Stir fried duck-flavorful

I swear the whole duck wasn't used.  Portioning was perfect for two.  It would have been nice if another tasting menu was available.  Too much DUCK.  

Dessert was a chocolate log w/a cookie crust at the bottom.  Eh.  C'mon, can we jazz it up with some CHINESE flava?  Red bean, taro, Asian pear, ANYTHING other than chocolate.

No booths here.  Tell them you're celebrating a birthday, and they'll bring out a candlelit platter of vanilla ice cream and almond cookies for FREE.  Haha, sadly it's not gorge-worthy.

We especially loved the Peking duck salad and Peking duck wonton soup. That salad was probably the best salad I've had. I would eat that salad everyday if I can. For the soup, there is only 1 wonton, but I couldn't complain. Quality vs. quantity? Quality always wins. The broth was creamy and flavorful, but had the right amount of saltiness.

2092977,2010-11-03,4,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"A bit of background information- I ate at Wing Lei a couple months ago and ever since then, the restaurant is now headed by executive chef Ming Yu.  There was a slight change in staffing, one that I'm not particularly fond of.

After being to several fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas and other parts of the countries, I've noticed that it's quite difficult to find a ridiculously stunning Chinese restaurant.  For example, there's a reason why you don't find French fast-food.  It's just not built that way.

Anyways, me and a client of mine went to Wing Lei with reservations, and we ordered the carpaccio and the potstickers for appetizers.  They were fine- they tasted fine and not as bold in flavor as other Chinese restaurants, so I don't think they were worth the money that you pay for.

As far as the main course goes, they were pretty good- even though the menu items are similar (if not the same) to other items you see at regular Chinese restaurants, you can tell the difference in taste.  Where the appetizers lack, the main course dishes compensate in terms of the strength in flavor.

If you went to a Chinese restaurant off the strip with chefs who DIDN'T go to cooking school and learned recipes straight from the mainland, you'll notice a difference in taste because when a dish is spicy, it's SPICY, or when it's sweet, you taste the sugar.  At Wing Lei, it's a little toned down because it's catered to tourist, but you can still notice the small distinctions of the dishes, like the sauce used in their General Tsao chicken and shiitake mushrooms used in their braised tofu dish.

I think that if you wanted a fancy Chinese restaurant with all the decor and all the service- this is certainly the place to take a date on.  This is NOT the place to take a large family with children.  As far as food goes, you can find other Chinese restaurants off-strip, or Pan-Asian cuisine that is loads better than Wing Lei.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,0,0,3,3iOqmPh5_mKwnfXQAKrY2A

They offered a very reasonably priced duck tasting menu this evening, but we elected to go for other entrees. The lobster, duck, and wonton soup were all fantastic. 

Most of all, the service sets this restaurant apart. Our server Ai was fantastic, and the whole team was very attentive. The wife was a bit chilly and I asked if there was an off-chance they had an extra shawl for her. They wrapped one around her in seconds - not minutes.

The decor and objective is S. Chinese high dining - so the prices are much higher, and the food selection is more HK/GZ.  Kobe beef sautee tops the list at 320 USD per plate.  Presumably, it's actually kobe given the extraordinary price.

Service was quick and attentive - our primary server was a well-heeled young lady from Tokyo named Ai.  Ordering chinese food in the US in Japanese was rather memorable and surreal.

Our group ultimately got rather raucous as the liquor flowed, and good vibes were felt all around.

I can't give it a 5, as the price point was a bit ridiculous for quality, if one were to compare it to its peers in HK - but the quality of cooking is actually very high and comparable to high end dining in HK.

Decor, as expected is sumptuous red and white, with S Chinese accents.  Shockingly unexpected, I know.",kcLuh-ck_Zj07TsodaaNUA,3,3,4,cuzvLk51hKeZ_UYJeOb1fA

The service is very cordial and the decor is very nice. We were there early in the evening, so I guess the staff felt relaxed. A cook stood outside the kitchen and rubbed his back on a doorway corner like a bear on a tree. Nice.

We ordered the Peking Duck, Mapo Tofu and Cantonese Sausage Rice. The ""Peking Duck"" is very suspect. I can't say for certain it isn't real Peking Duck, but it certainly did not taste like it. It very much tasted like regular old roast duck. The tofu and the rice were very good, but I would certainly hope so for what they are charging their entrees for.

Basically, you could have a comparable or BETTER tasting Chinese meal at any number of other good Chinese restaurants in town for a quarter of the price.

2299102,2017-08-16,5,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"Body Shamed in Wing Lei 
I didn't have the strength to comment on my horrific experience in Wing Lei for days. Two powerful women as my sister and I were left feeling extremely insecure and depressed. 
I have no simple words to describe my experience so this is going to be a detailed comment. 
We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my sisters first job and graduation. She is a Lawyer and I am a Senior SAP Consultant based in America. I have lived all over the world and I am American and have dual citizenship. I am a self-proclaimed ""foodie"" and have dined in Michelin star restaurants and have dined with Michelin star chefs from all over the world. For this reason, I was interested in Wing Lei. We dressed up ready to party and ready to have a good night. She wore a dress and I wore a jumpsuit from my favorite website houseofcb.com. Had a reservation for Wing Lei from two weeks before and we walked in and gave our reservation name. I could see that the attendant was eyeing us and talking in their own language amongst each other, which was the first rude thing I have noticed. Finally, the attendant found our reservation, I could see he was hesitant. The male slowly walked towards me and whispered "" we cannot have ""excessive clothing"" in Wing Lei so would you mind wearing a shawl? "". To start with I have dined with Hakkasan the night before. When they call in to confirm the reservation they specify the dress code and are very helpful. They say no shorts, no flip flops and they make sure their business runs smooth. Wing Lei's dress code is not on the confirmation e-mail, nor is reminded on the confirmation call. And what is ""excessive clothing""? According to what to whom!!!! I also want to remind this is Vegas and when we look at other people we were very normal. I have an athletic body anyways and would not consider myself ""sexy"" in any circumstance.  
Even though we were bothered we really wanted to try the food so we said yes for them bringing the shawls and wrapping it around our shoulders (which were covered already...). What happened next was unbelievable. Five minutes into our waiting (no drinks and no seats were offered, no apologies for the wait) they came out with two men jackets! They were jackets worn by waiters and they were huge! They were not clean! You could feel they were hot and most probably stripped from someone else. A Michelin star restaurant was offering men jackets XXXXL to two woman that put effort into looking good for a special occasion night. We are very slim and the jackets were x3 times our size. We were so offended and refused to wear the jackets. Then the male attendant said they could bring shawls from another restaurant. We refused and left to not cause a scene as we had no fault. To begin with how can you have only one shall in this restaurant if you are very strict about women wearing tight skirts or jumpsuits? Second of all how can you think anyone will wear somebody else's jacket from another gender? How can you handle an incident this poorly and unprofessionally! 
Afterwards we called of course called them and said that we were very sad about what happened and how they handled the situation. They didn't even apologize. That night we dined in TAO and they felt sorry for our experience and said they have never ever heard of anything similar in Las Vegas. They were a perfect host and will be back for more in TAO and it was sooo much cooler. 
As women people will try to pull us down, body shame and make us feel insecure about ourselves. We should not allow this. I still think about that moment and I feel anger. It is okay to be smart, it is okay to be stupid, it is okay to be athletic or not but it is not okay to make a woman feel that her body is sooo revealing and so sexual that you should cover it up with a men's jacket. Because you know what? We are beautiful no matter what we wear. I will never recommend Wing Lei.",jqqCKv7lsdGr6oD_eO-dZg,3,0,1,LlUcPYHOptXbg7QpB6Zpig

My reservation at 9pm, it close at 10pm.
Before my group was seated, the assigned waiter approached me and said, our kitchen close at 9:45 n you need to order quick.

I was reading the menu, the waiter came twice and rushed me to order, I immediately felt uncomfortable n don't know what to order.

About the food: price ranging from 36 to 42, the quality is terrible, you can get 12 to 18 out site the strip with much better quality n taste foods. The steam rice is $5/bowl which I am fine to pay for that price but they use a lousy rice.

I am not a cheapskate, I have dine and pay for $900 per meal per person n consider myself as aficionado foods connoisseur.

About the service: this is the worse part of my experience. 5 stars rating fine dinning but the service is equal or perhaps worse than some of lousy Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. How can a fine dinning restaurant's kitchen close 15 minutes before it closing time; this is only happen at the money pinching lousy Chinese restaurant where all their kitchen crews must be out by certain time to avoid paying OT. 

The waiter was very unprofessional n I felt the discrimination on his looks. The manager was equally arrogance n discriminating. This is what I called ""reversed discrimination"" when these Asian manager, waiter(est), server were Asian themselves n look down upon their own race, thinking that only the Caucasian can afford in their establishment.  

Wynn management, you need to seriously review Wing Lei establishment n major training to avoid the reversed discrimination.
We, your Asian customers might not look n dress like the Caucasian but trust me? We are equal or maybe more in spending for luxuries n fine dining.",LJgEn5tD7hhKTlqwluuLGQ,0,0,1,exbNE9uuve1wSwWD7fJHAg

But being it is a Michelin restuarant and we have a show to watch at this hotel, we decide to try it out. 

Kumquat mojito - Perfect for my tasting! Refreshing, sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet, alcohol is just the right amount, not too much. Very refreshing. 

Hot n sour soup - expensive because they added some seafood in it. Not worth it to me. Some part of it is even cold. Not warm enough. It feels like that they added the seafood in right before they give it to me and it's still cold. My least favorite. 

Peking duck - their most famous dish. Lived up to the expectation. The meat and skin are one of the best! However, they were served with Mexican tortillas. So weird. (Not the soft thin one you have at Beijing). The worst thing is that tortillas is hard!such a drawback! We had to ask to change it to the bun! 

Sea Bass - we wanted the steamed one which was not on the menu but they said they can make it. It was amazing! This one is such a surprise. So fresh and perfectly cooked! The first bite I took I was already so impressed! 

Customer service - Superior! They granted every request I had. Give me a free desert to go because we didn't have time to eat desert. 

We spend $250 for 2 people. Overall, it's a good restaurant but does not deserve the Michelin standard or worth the money in my opinion.",cMhG3BYxG6iRGyXNS6rwdg,1,1,4,6RD1UIx5OBhIFYIFtUhQPg

My one legit complaint is that the dim sum came out very rarely. It's probably part of the ambiance because a high end place with a bunch of carts rolling around may not look right but it means a majority of brunch is walking up to the buffet table. Had nice selection so it's hard to complain but I love dim sum and really came for that. I went back forth between 4 or 5 stars.

We were watching Le Reve at Wynn and figured it would be easier to eat there.  As always, Chinese food is preferred by my uncle (he is visiting and I am taking him around).  So I told him we would be going here.

Everybody LOVED the food there.  It was not just authentic, but also well-made.  I used to say there is no such a thing as gourmet Chinese food.  I take it back now.  There is!  You just have to be willing to pay for it!  

They had two menus.  The big one is for westerners and the small one is for real Chinese food.  Of course we ordered from the small one.  We had the soup of the day, chicken with ginger in clay pot, Dongpo Pork, steamed red snapper (or some sort of red fish) and stir-fried big snow pea sprouts.  Everything was absolutely delicious (the chicken was probably the only one we didn't love but still liked).  I don't think I even ever had any Cantonese or Shanghai? food that good in China. The Dongpo Pork was a braised/stewed pork belly dish.  It looked really fatty but it didn't taste that way at all.  It was really tender and had a sweet flavor.  The fish was steamed to perfection.

I honestly don't know why the rating here is so low.  I specialize in Chinese food and this place was just undoubtedly amazing.  I think the price might have something to do with it. For four people, the bill was $420 incl. tips and we didn't even have wine but three beers (I don't drink).  Rice was $4/bowl...I also think those people who didn't like this place because they ordered off the big menu too.

Anyway, if you are planning an extravagant trip to Vegas and would like some really good Chinese food, this is the place.  I won't do it myself, but as long as someone else is paying for it, I am all cool.",1b83gvGq97mk_2DmSa8dHg,5,3,5,Rn5bzkjHsb5R-7M4m6hfcA

Before I came in here, I thought, ""How could it be possible for Chinese food to garner the attention of Michelin and be high class and noteworthy?"" I assumed only great hole-in-the-walls in San Francisco or New York had amazing Chinese grub. But alas, gourmet Chinese food DOES exist!

The decor is beautifully decadent, gilded in gold every inch you see. Service is phenomenal--attentive, polite, unobtrusive, helpful, accommodating. You couldn't ask for more. Tempted to try one of their mouthwatering tasting menus, but feeling gluttonous from our recent overeating adventures, decided against it. Hopefully next time! We started off with the appetizer sampler, which included a BBQ glazed rib, shrimp toast and Alaskan King crab salad--all three absolutely delicious! The rib was juicy, with a hint of sweetness. The shrimp toast was by far the best shrimp toast I've ever had! The salad was stuffed with huge chunks of crab. All the ingredients were fresh and of the best quality--my husband devoured the avocado in it and he hates avocado! We also shared a bowl of the vegetable hot & sour soup, which was well-made and heftily laden with veggies. Also to share was the pan-seared striped bass and garlic beef tenderloin--both cooked to perfection! Sides of bok choy and vermicelli noodles were also made with the utmost care, and tasted light and flavorful. No room for dessert unfortunately, but still received a plate of bite-sized sweet treats to enjoy, particularly the almond biscuit cookie and eclair were unforgettable!

Authentic and well-made, I'm not sure why this place has low ratings, but I can only assume it's due to the high price.",2JUW4ay9IEcJSxMDSm-HBQ,11,10,5,cBJyQPy2j83ykiJSqtjfdw

Which is not the case at all here. If you come in to eat here  then you sb aware that it is not cheap and expect to spend some time here. It's not fast food.

I had the pleasure of spending a couple of hours here the other night and had a great time. My chicken soup (forget what its called exactly) and scallops entree were excellent. The spring rolls appetizers and dim sum were quite good as well. I really liked the fact that you can taste the ingredients that go into the dish as opposed to it being some nasty jumbled mess of breaded/fried chicken/pork stuff. The sea bass ordered at the table also received high praise. 

The service was attentive - wine glasses were never empty but the wait staff wasn't always breathing over your shoulder either.

It's a small dining room, with a view of a beautiful garden.  There's a dress code, but I think you're fine with jeans and a nice top.

Service was okay.  They only gave every other person a menu, which was odd.  Our waiter also forgot to get one person's dessert order, but then he came back quickly and apologized.

The food was okay.  The BF liked it a lot.  I've had better.  We had scallops, chowmein, fried rice, wok fry mushrooms, vegetable dim sum, vegetable spring rolls, chocolate caramel dessert, and red wine. The chowmein, fried rice, and dim sum was my favorite.

2997116,2012-06-29,1,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"By way of introduction, this is a very upscale Chinese restaurant in the Wynn in Las Vegas. It's the first and only Chinese restaurant to receive a Michelin Star, which is one of the reasons why we were so eager to try it. 

First, the good: 
- The restaurant is at the Wynn, which means the decor is over-the-top pretty. You sit in huge chairs, and the surroundings are positively opulent. 
- The service was quite good, for us at least. The restaurant wasn't at all busy, so perhaps this helps. 
- The food was really very tasty. It was quite good. Here are some highlights: 
     - The duck salad appetizer was really tasty. It had a crispy bowl of sesame seed crackers, and really yummy light truffle dressing. It was easily the most innovative dish of the whole meal. Try this! 
     - The pot stickers were just that -- four pot stickers. Price? $15!!?!?!?!?!
     - The kung pao chicken was really good. 
     - A very surprising thing: get the CHILI SAUCE. We were like ""wow, why does everything have this delicious subtle cinnamon(y) flavor to it?"" The chili sauce! Very tasty. 
     - The general tao chicken was also tasty. 
     - The fried rice was good, and filled with shrimp. 
     - The wine list, by the glass, wasn't bad at all. 

Then, the interesting: 
- OK, when you go around the Wynn it's like this: white person, white person, Latino person, white person, Indian person, white person, white person. When you get to Wing Lei it's like they stuffed ALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLE in the Asian restaurant. They aren't anywhere else, and there's no one but Asian people here. Kind of odd. 

Lastly, the bad: 
- Umm, the ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE DOLLARS the dinner cost us. We got two appetizers, two mediocre soups, two entrees, fried rice, and two glasses of wine. No dessert. That's a lot of money for really good but still pretty standard Chinese food. Aside from the duck salad and the chili sauce, there was nothing really outstanding about the food. It was all good, but not $200 good. 
- The aforementioned soups (won ton and hot and sour) were pretty standard. Nothing special here. 

In sum, the food was good, but how did this get a Michelin Star?",LTWUnGE5dCVGFsKuwuWV9A,2,0,3,f05EfcRIKJLP8BLs4YFXYA

In short, I think they're riding this ""star"" all the way to the bank. Don't get me wrong- the food was great, one of the best prepared I've had in the US, but not in the top 5. It was easily the most expensive though, and I guess considering the price, I was hoping for an epiphany of sorts- I very much wanted to leave saying , ""So THAT'S what truly world class Chinese food is supposed to taste like!"".  Unfortunately that wasn't the case. Had the steamed cod, mushrooms, duck breast (not the Peking duck), and noodles. For dessert, 2 scoops of ice cream.  Service was fantastic (although the staff member who deboned the fish had some difficulty), the setting and elegant decor is just knock out. For 100$ this would have been 5 stars. For almost 4x that (2 people), not so much. I was impressed however, with the little chair they gave my companion to put her bag on.",KAbPArFnp0dqZ_1bh8FFTQ,1,0,3,dnDakkkgW-VkVkgzhcF38g

It was fine, but not worth the $80 or $90 per person they were charging.  If you go at a certain time of day (before 6, I think), the duck meal is often $20 off per person, and that might be worth it, but don't be late if you don't want to get gouged.  You can go to the little old Lemongrass Cafe in Henderson and get seven courses of beef that'll stuff two people and blow your mind for about $20 total, and you can get a whole roast duck anywhere in Chinatown for $10-$15, so you have to be in a pretty decadent mood to want to eat food that's merely on par at Wing Lei.   My girlfriend had the shrimp dish with asparagus and hated it.  I kind of liked it because it had a weird bitter herb flavor.  My dad got the wine pairing to go with his duck and was only thrilled with the Grenache.  Four small glasses of wine, $40.

3074939,2014-02-09,6,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"This review is for their seasonal Chinese New Year Brunch which ran for 2 weeks.  The price was $68.88 and it came with an insane amount of food.  

For the seafood fans, there's 5-6 selections of sushi, shrimp cocktail, king crab claws, oysters, and whole lobsters.....And this isn't like the old Rio seafood buffet where you see asians fighting over and topping their plates full of lobster 7-8 deep.  There's so many options everyone will be pleased.

The dim sum rolled around every 15 minutes or so.  There was lobster, scallop, and shark fin dumpling along with your standard dim sum fare.  The soy sauce chicken, duck, and pork belly were especially delicious.

If you're still going strong, there's about a dozen hot entree items such as filet mignon tips, sea bass, two kinds of shrimp (curry and chile sauce) and yee mien.
There's a huge dinosaur size tomohawk chop for the meat lovers and 3 soups to choose from.  For dessert save room for the flaky dan tat egg custard, sesame balls, or their assortment of non asian desserts.

Overall everything was good but nothing really blew me away.  Having had the Mozen brunch a month ago, Wing Lei is head and shoulders above it in all areas.  Since Wing Lei is seasonal I'd take advantage and try it out once.  

The one thing that was annoying was they charged $48.88 for children under 6.  I dont' have any kids but that's certainly Wing's way of telling you to leave them behind.

** PS - Had their Peking Duck tasting menu and it was amazing - super expensive - i'd love to come back for dinner but i'm asian so paying 40-50 bucks for one plate of food is insane - maybe next time on someone's dime. **",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,10,4,4,qlNG8Uugoyi2OGPX-Wp5vA

3100324,2011-07-13,0,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"It seems like the bad reviews for this place were mainly because of the pricing of the menu. The reviews with 1-2 stars seem to say that Chinese food shouldn't be expensive. It makes me sad that people have categorized Chinese food into cheap eats and that the general impression of Chinese food is that it should not be expensive. Maybe the countless Chinese take-away places popping up all over America have helped reinforced this stereotype.

First of all, in terms of the price and atmosphere at Wing Lei, it is no different than if you dined at a very nice Chinese restaurant in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. In fact, it is very common to have Chinese restaurants like these and in this price range (and sometimes even more expensive) in Asia. Chinese food does not only belong to the cheap take-away food category. If there can be an expensive steak house, the same is said for a very good Chinese restaurant. Wing Lei reminded us alot of the very good Chinese restaurants we've been to in several parts of Asia and we were impressed as to how close Wing Lei tries to execute their concept.

We had the 6-course peking duck tasting menu and loved every bit of it. We also thought that for $88 per person it was quite a good deal. In fact, we imagined that doing this same tasting menu in an equally fancy restaurant in Singapore or Hong Kong would have cost us more. We had the duck meat and skin served on an incredibly soft bun, duck salad, duck wonton with broth, stir-fried duck with veg, egg noodles with duck, and mango sorbet for dessert. The amount of food was definitely more than substantial and we were already very full before dessert. 

The service was also good, friendly, and professional. We asked if they had Thai birds eye chilli (we love our food spicy!) and the server said they would ask the kitchen to chop some of the fresh chillis for us. 

Overall we were impressed with Wing Lei. It was definitely a well deserved Michelin star they received.",-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,12,7,5,wKGS7Rt4iIKhRSUC17XcTw

The weight staff was very attentive and observant of our table as I saw them constantly keeping an eye or our dish consumption. Initially they did serve us wine that we originally thought was for sampling but ending up being by accident and it was not intended for our table. I do have to say it was a very delicious Plum Wine; we decided to keep it anyway after the confusion. Our waiter May was very informative and friendly to our questions but just over half way through she did disappear and never returned back to our table; nothing was mentioned to us. My salad appetizer was good very well plated and all fresh with no signs of mis handling. Recommended Duck Dish was good as well with great plating and taste. Dessert was again well plated and taste delicious as well. They did however still charge us for the Wine mixup from earlier which should have been comped as it was a mistake. The table was a bit large for two people to have dinner unless they are sitting beside each other and not across.

We were a little early for our reservation and they didn't seat us immediately, so we sat at the bar.  There were several large parties and I believe they have an age limit as as I didn't see any little kids here.  The restaurant is very eye-catching with the classy decor, exquisite place setting, and bright golds and green colors in the room. 

Note:  it is only open from 5:30 - 10:00 p.m. 

We ordered a variety of dishes and started with the Alaskan crab salad which was a pretty small portion with mango, avocado and a citrus sauce we all loved.  It was a yuzu-miso vinaigrette.  This was a great start to the meal and we all wanted another portion, lol!  It did take a while for food to come out and they place everything on carts which are wheeled around.  

For our meal, we got the grilled sea bass, scallops, the mu shu pork and a side of eggplant.  The mu shu pork was my least favorite, but I tend to like Peking duck in buns. However, the Peking duck here was only served whole (at at $98 I was not ready to commit to it!)  The eggplant side was a perfect pairing for the seafood.  We noted that he food was not salty, but rather used seasonings like sweet garlic, slices of ginger and whole black beans to create the bold flavors.  We were able to really taste natural flavors of the food and this made us appreciate the fine dining meal here at Wing Lei. Dessert here wasn't my favorite and they were out of the panna cotta, but the trio we ordered was small and very sweet.

The duck comes in two courses; first is the traditional wrap (get the crepes for god's sake if you want to do it right), which the server assembles for you! That is delightful to me for whatever reason. 

My first time at Wing Lei, we got the second course as-is, in which they minced the rest of the duck meat and put it into little lettuce cups with an unnecessary amount of chopped water chestnuts. Extremely unimpressive.

Pro tip: Instead of getting the stupid lettuce cups, ask the server to simply carve the rest of the bird and serve you a platter of delicious duck meat (with extra green onions on the side in my case). It's a much better way to enjoy the duck, trust me. 

Seafood corn egg drop soup is good, as are the salads and cocktails. We liked the mapo tofu the first time but the second time, it was mild, which is just wrong. We improvised by throwing a bunch of little Thai chilies in it.

Apart from the duck, my favorite thing about Wing Lei is the fact that they play Chinese pop music in the background! Who doesn't love hearing Jay Chou at a fancy Vegas restaurant? :)",1hZVnRwEuKP4Q_PnuF8fwQ,3,1,4,vFaYLVBIfY4pcg1nwResug
3746328,2013-02-04,3,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"My family and I came ages ago, sometime in the late 00's (so long ago, I can't even remember), because my dad had a $150 gift card. This review is clearly long overdue, but here's my two cents anyway.

First, the decor is absolutely gorgeous. With red, gold, and black accents, the ambience is very elegant and luxurious. One of the things I remember most about our dinner was not the food, but the beautiful chairs they had at every table. There were some tables that had booth seats on one side, against the wall, and those were just as opulent.

At the time, my parents didn't want to go over the $150, so there were only so many things we could order. As I'm Taiwanese, I don't see a reason to spend more than $20 (heck, even $10) on one Chinese dish. Majority of the plates here are at least $30, going as high as $90. I'm glad I'm fortunate enough to live in an area where authentic Chinese & Taiwanese food is readily available for less than $10. Anyway, between the four of us, I believe we shared 3-4 plates. Since this was awhile back, I don't remember exactly what we ordered; just that it was surprisingly tasty.

I would love to come back again for dinner, even though I don't remember the specifics. Considering that Asian fusion restaurants seem to cater to non-Asians more -- I'm looking at you P.F. Chang's -- I'm just happy that I didn't find the food repulsive. Wing Lei is an upscale restaurant with tasty Chinese food that will appeal to even the harshest native Chinese food critic.

One for eating and one for taking food from the shared dishes. This aspect could not have been better.
We went for the signature tasting. It was over the top ingredients. There was lobster, and A5 Wagyu, and black truffles on a dish. The Wagyu was cooked completely inconsistent for the table. Almost none was proper very medium rare. A little was rare to the point the fat was hard. Most was medium well to absolutely no hints of pink well done. The truffles must have been summer truffles. There was very little flavor, and no real aromatics. The lobster was pretty good. The wine matches were perfect. That was a positive.
We bought the shrimp toast separately. It was perfect. Some other dishes were also excellent. I'm not wealthy. This is a special splurge. I've spent a lot at other meals.

I believe the deal is every day, between 5:30 and the last seating at that price is at 6:45. The regular price is $88 per person. I would have gotten it at either price.

Food: 1st course- hand carved duck with scallions and cucumber, hoisin sauce in a home made pancake. The duck was delicious, just the right amount of fat on the skin! The meat was very tender. The hoisin sauce was definitely home-made and prepared with our pancakes. There were some on the side for dipping, but it wasn't really necessary. The pancakes were thin, like crepes. 

2nd course- mixed greens with almonds, duck, mandarin slices with a peanut dressing. This is probably one of the best salads I have ever had. You cannot go wrong with the best ingredients. Loved the marcona almonds. The salad was presented in a deep fried wonton bowl. The dressing was light and dressed well.

3rd course- duck soup. The broth was clear and seasoned well, not salty like soup from other places. The meat was prepared with shitake mushrooms and veggies in wonton wrappers. The texture of the wontons was wonderful paired with mushrooms. The flavor of the mushrooms just burst in your mouth.

4th and 5th - wok fried duck with veggies and pan-seared duck noodles. The noodles were very fresh, as were the veggies. If you like mushrooms, you will love these dishes.

Dessert- upscale kit kat bar with mango tapioca (cold soup). The ""kit kat bar"" was round and dressed in some amazing dark chocolate topped with gold leaf. I could have had a whole bowl of that cold tapioca soup. The waiter brought out a special dessert plate for my boyfriend on top of the dessert was included with the meal. He got mandarin oranges in syrup and some creamy tart. I did not try them so I cannot comment on the taste.

Service: This service was definitely on par with a restaurant of this caliber. The waiter and wait staff seemed to know what I wanted when I wanted. The restaurant had plenty of patrons, but we felt like we were the only guests there. I normally don't like to pay this much for Chinese food, but we were celebrating a special occasional and I was curious since they are Michelin rated.

The sweet aroma of caramelized roasted garlic commanded my attention and I inhaled deeply in anticipation of the upcoming feast.  Large golden dragons with eyes ablaze peered down at me from their pedestals and summoned me to enter their sacred culinary Shangri La.  

An amalgamation of Cantonese, Shanghai and Szechuan flavors, my meal was prepared by Executive Chef Ming Yu and his talented staff.  Wing Lei is the only Chinese restaurant to be awarded a highly respected Michelin star.

I arrived on time but my coveted dinner reservation was useless as I had to wait approximately 45 minutes for a reserved table.  It was time to belly up to the bar and savor a pre-dinner cocktail.  My gut instinct was to order the Asian inspired Lychee Martini. I eventually discovered the tiny fruit dates back to China 1059 A.D. and ""represents love and royalty"".  The drink, crisp with subtle flavors and slightly sweet, had me feeling like a Queen as I nibbled the bulbous lychee fruit floater with sheer pleasure.

Appetizers included: Pan Grilled Pork Pot Stickers and Peking Duck Salad with Truffle Vinaigrette.  I would have preferred more duck in my salad.  Both starters were very good and not swimming in an overabundance of peanut and sesame oils.

Szechwan Chili Prawns were quickly wok fried in a spicy soy bean sauce and served with tons of garlic and choy sum (similar to boy choy). The prawns were decadently delicious. A side dish of assorted fungi included Enoki, Shitake and King Oyster. The mushrooms were a perfect savory combo with the sweet prawns.

In conclusion, the ambiance was lovely and the service was stellar.  My meal was well prepared and delightful but dinner amounted to $250 for two people and two cocktails.  That is expensive for prawns, choy sum, various veggies and shreds of Peking duck.

Albeit, I throughly enjoyed my dining experience at Wing Lie, when future cravings for Asian inspired food arise I will refrain from driving out to Vegas. OC has plenty of great Chinese food at half the cost.  Cheers!",4mkYPmYB3AthX1FBCWbSsg,1,1,4,xkyAuprqyczwTCnS2iLbvQ

Dim Sum qualify is quite good. Not a huge variety, but all the basics. I'll select quality over quantity any day.  Siu Mai, har gow, siu mai w/ fat choy, chicken feet, ham sieu gok, etc.
Dim Sum cart service was superb. Often you need to befluent in at least ""Chinese food-speak"" to thoroughly understand what is being served, but all speak English, and they open all the covers atop the bamboo steamers, so you can see exactly what goodies are under there.  
As for the buffet entree items, the best of the best is the halved chilled lobsters.
Quality teas offered here too. Normally lesser quality white teas (soh-may cha) are served. Instead, we were served the Silver Needles tea ($18.00).

A downside we experienced was on Sunday, when we originally tried to get in.   They have a no reservations policy, except for very large groups, but they spontaneously changed it for people who were attending a concert at the MGM. So, even though we arrived 90 minutes earlier, expecting to wait our turn in que, we were told they were completely sold out because they took the names of those who arrived earlier and that they were returning later. What is that about??? Why should people attending a concert at another hotel be given priority over anyone else? They should have been made to stay AND wait in line like everyone else everyday. NO EXCEPTIONS!!
One more downside - They ran out yesterday of rambutans!  As most Chinese Americans know, rambutans are plentiful in Southeast Asia, but hard to get in the US, and if you find them, they're usually not fresh, but super expensive. Boo-hoo.

We shared the entrees: Kungpao chicken (just ok, nothing special), mongolian beef (again, just average), and some weird cod dish that was recommended by the waiter, it was ok, but not worth the $50 price tag.

The menu was extensive, but exactly what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. My absolute favorite was the peking duck. Be prepared for a lot of food since it comes with 2 courses, first the duck in pancakes then the duck in lettuce wraps. Both were flavorful and filling.

The service was excellent and you definitely felt like you were having a fine dining experience even though you were eating the same type of food you would get delivered on a rainy Sunday evening!

I'm not sure if I would return, simply because Vegas is filled with incredible restaurants I am dying to try...but I would certainly recommend it if you're in the mood for some great Chinese food.",omLF2yIAL90uh9C-YKNtjA,0,0,4,LJo4gdeW13LYaZa15c0LUQ

And like Michelin, I also give Wing Lei a star-but on a scale of five.   Wonderful setting and great service, but the food is plain awful, and based on the large number of positive reviews peppered with bad ones, clearly this is a case of the emperor has no clothes.  One Open Table reviewer swooned particularly over the General Tso's Chicken.  I've had better gloppy orange colored chicken at buck-a-plate Chinese fast food steam table outlets in South Central Los Angeles than what they served at Wing Lei.  Given that Wing Lei charges $29 and the same dish costs $2.50 in the hood, that's a pretty strong indictment of how bad the food is at Wing Lei.    The duck salad wasn't awful, but neither was it particularly good.

4402131,2017-10-19,5,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"Wing Lei is a high-end Chinese restaurant, one of many fine dining experiences offered in the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino. It is here that I would have one of the tastiest Peking Duck meals I've had, even as it came at a steep price, which was almost justified by dining in Wing Lei's lavish and audacious dining room adorned with jewels and gold.

There exists a number of large, ornate Chinese restaurants in this country that are not too far removed from their strip-mall take-out brethren, and Wing Lei's regal and unmistakable Chinese ornamentation is what these restaurants aspire to have, but can't quite achieve due to budgetary constraints, and thus need to settle on substandard furnishings that leave the restaurant with a décor that, to Western sensibilities, feels and looks dated or just downright hokey from the moment they open. Stunning results can be achieved when a Chinese restaurant is permitted access to Steve Wynn's checking account, proving that the not-so-thin line between gauche and garish is a few million bucks.

When I was seated, I was presented with a Chinese welcome tea with lychee and honey, which was a tantalizing light, floral, and sweet way to begin my meal. Next came an amuse bouche of Compressed Melon with Cucumber, Carrots, and Ginger Vinaigrette, another well-prepared taste, this one much sweeter than the tea, with a tangy vinaigrette that added an unctuous mouth-feel and prevented this bite from being one-note.

Reviewing the menu, I noted that Wing Lei serves an Imperial Duck Tasting for $98 per person (an extra $48 for wine pairing) which includes schmancy versions of the traditional stir-fry and soup courses, but it requires, at minimum, two people who both want the tasting, which was one more than I had. I instead ordered the regular Imperial Peking Duck entrée, which consisted only of a single course: the skin and meat separately carved tableside. This is oddly the same price as the tasting.

Even though I didn't get my traditional second and third courses with the entrée, the duck was, of course, presented tableside with head still attached per the Peking Duck ritual. The sticky reddish-brown skin, glazed with malt syrup and soy, had a magnificent luster to it. Several of the wait-staff then gathered around the cart and began carving the duck and wrapping the duck skin, meat, scallions, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce into ch?n bing (referred to on Wing Lei's menu as ""crepes"") in an assembly line manner, a symphony of efficient and effective blade work and wrapping by the servers.

At most Chinese restaurants that serve Peking Duck, the process of assembling the duck and garnitures into ch?n bing is DIY, but I'm not complaining -- the workmanship performed here was excellent, with each duck ""wrap"" having what seemed to be a perfect ratio of duck skin to duck meat to vegetables to sweet hoisin. I removed pieces of skin from the wraps to gnaw on, and they were all independently crackly as they ought to be. They didn't quite pass Heston Blumenthal's test of the skin shattering into pieces when thrown at the plate, but close enough. I'm told that it's difficult to find Peking Duck skin that good in America, and I've only had that level of Peking Duck at Decoy in NYC.

The meat itself had a good muscle-to-fat ratio and intense flavor that was definitely ""ducky"" enough without being so gamy as to taste spoiled. The floor manager indicated they source their ducks from a farm in Rhode Island, and they're slightly smaller than the ducks I'd typically see served as Peking Duck. The duck entrée here can feed two people who also order appetizers. Once I was full, I took the remaining wraps (about 40% remained) and all of the meat and bones back to my hotel room for later consumption.

Because I was so stuffed, there was no need to order dessert. Petit fours were nonetheless provided which included a Green Tea Macaron, 5-Spice Chocolate Nugget, and Coconut Ball. Additionally, Wing Lei sent me away with a take-home Yuzu Almond Cake, which I enjoyed for breakfast the next morning.

Food/Décor/Service: 4.6/4.5/4.7

NOTE about Wing Lei's Yelp rating: I was initially surprised by the Yelp rating here being as low as it is, but then I started to read the reviews and realized how ridiculous people are when they come to a place like this. Almost all of the one-star reviews are due to dress code issues. Is it too much to ask for people to put a jacket on and wear proper shoes when visiting an expensive fine dining restaurant? One woman who can barely type a coherent sentence recently one-starred Wing Lei because they gave her a jacket to cover up because they didn't want her dining in the restaurant dressed like a tramp and she of course blamed it on ""body-shaming"" -- as if some man who showed up to a Michelin-starred restaurant in a wife-beater or muscle shirt would be treated any differently. Yelp is such a pit sometimes, and the reviews to this restaurant are testimony to some of our worst.",lv5TnHGfrSb_CIisOw0irg,8,8,5,APsnKBWs8I6XAnZokMmKbw
4426927,2009-09-27,0,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"It's interesting because this place is a 2 michelin star Chinese restaurant. I'm not usually a fan of high end Chinese food but we came here for a bday dinner and since they were serving a really good special right now. They have a peking duck tasting served 5 ways for $69. It is normally $88 but $38 wine pairing and ours included a glass of wine also. I went with the other dinner special which was a 3 course meal. i started off with shrimp toast, which was pretty good, and salmon dikon salad. It came with walnuts that tasted like the ones in honey walnut shrimp. The first course of the duck was a table side duck carving, and they prepare it wrapped already with the hoisin sauce and cucumbers. That was delicious. 

The meal was served family style even though we ordered seperate tasting menus, and I was surprised the portions were humongous for a upscale restaurant. (I guess I'm used to french food where the portions are elf size). They had a peking duck salad served in something like a gigantic won ton shell. The sauce on that salad was very good. Next, the duck came with noodles and chinese brocolli, and then sauteed with black bean sauce. I thought the flavoring was pretty good. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was very light and a large portion. My tasting menu also came with a cocktail and I had the lychee martini. 

I looked at the original menu and I was impressed that they served a lot of seafood sashimi style and then 3 different ways. You can get lobster, clam and shrimp all done that way. It's rare for me to see a restaurant that does lobster sashimi, although that's where the prices skyrocket at $85/lb. Shibuya at MGM serves it for $250. 

Dessert was a pineapple cake and mango tapioca with coconut ice cream. Both very chinese with a touch of classiness. Hmm all in all, I was not very impressed for a 2 michelin star place but for chinese food fine dining, I enjoyed it.",RDZV5cfJRE5Ocyl67Mm7UA,4,3,4,4iVy6dSBzM3DHAJ4P1OmyQ
4444167,2013-02-16,4,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"I visited Wing Lei on Super Bowl Sunday quite frankly because of the the Michelin Star that it received in 2009. I called in the night before to make a reservation and the hostess at Wing Lei was sure to let me know how fantastic the restaurant was by naming all of the restaurants accolades. Needless to say, my expectations were sky high.

Before I get into the meat of the review, I think it is important to explain why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars. Given all of this restaurant's high level of achievement, I rated this restaurant against the very best restaurants that I have been to. It is quite obvious to me that if I were to rate and star Wing Lei against every other Chinese Restaurant in the United States, I would give it 4 or 5 stars without hesitation. 

However, with that said, here is why I was not so impressed with Wing Lei. Given the prestige of the restaurant, I found it appropriate to order the tasting menu offered by Chef Ming Yu. In true Michelin taste, there was a distinctly French flair to the menu that left the cuisine's Chinese authenticity in question. For instance, the first course of cold sea food was a prawn salad served with caviar, the soup dish was a truffle stuffed wonton soup, and subsequent dishes included duck, wagyu beef short ribs, and sea bass which were all plated and presented in a distinctly Western style. Although the tasting menu was for two people, none of the dishes were family style in the traditional Chinese sense, and there was a different glass of wine served for each course. It's not that Wing Lei takes a hit for having a French oriented tasting menu. The food was quite good and the sea bass was especially cooked to perfection. However, by serving a French style meal, the restaurant clearly opened itself up to a different standard of service that unfortunately falls short in my book. 

First and foremost, I was taken back the Maitre d's lack of knowledge, and even unwillingness to explain what was being served. For instance, the wagyu beef dish, was served without any explanation. It was not until I inquired about the dish, when a waiter explained that what I was eating was beef with vegetables. Likewise, each wine was served with very little explanation. A typical explanation was literally ""here is a red wine from France, 1999"" or ""here is a desert wine from Hungary"". Given that this menu featured a dessert white wine from Hungary, it seems clear to me that Chef Min Yu or his sommolier meticulously chose specific wines to accompany his dishes. The wait staff's lack of knowledge regarding both the food and the wine does not do this food justice especially because the chef takes an audacious and an uncharted approach to serving a French-Chinese fusion cuisine. A restaurant that attempts to serve food of this caliber must guide their customer through the whole culinary experience or else the customer will be left with a confused palate and more questions rather than pure satisfaction. Ultimately,  this meal left me wishing that I had just opted to go the traditional Chinese route (which the restaurant serves). 

If you decide to dine at Wing Lei, here are my suggestions:
-Forego the tasting menu and go the traditional route. 

-Looking at other reviews on Yelp, it is clear that you cannot go wrong with Wing Lei's Peking Duck.

-You should not go out of your way to visit this restaurant just because they received a Michelin Star once upon a time. 

After all, I do not suspect that Wing Lei is far superior to other high end Chinese restaurants in town such as Empress Court at Caesars or Pearl at MGM. In any case, a visit to Wing Lei is certainly not a mundane experience. If your primary experience of Chinese food comes from Panda Express, expect to be wowed. If you frequent authentic Chinese restaurants and you forego the tasting menu, I think you will come away understanding that you are paying a generous premium for better quality food for a special occasion. Just don't eat at Wing Lei and expect it to be among the world's best restaurants.",TFaOJ9089-P2hMBy2zR6-w,4,2,3,ReCpRQyd4xESfQBzeJ50kQ

i'm chinese. so for me, paying more than $40 on chinese dinner is really ridiculous. but i was in vegas for business and since the client loves chinese food, here we were. all 16 of us.

we started off with an array of appetizers. the highlights? the mu-shu vegetable wraps. the hoisin sauce it came with was NOT hoisin. maybe a hoisin imitator but i guess i shouldnt be too surprised. the vegetable egg rolls weren't too bad either but definitely nothing special.

next we all ordered our own entrees. i got the three cup black cod. HIGHLY recommend this dish. the fish was so good...think miso black cod but chinese style. i also tried the lobster, sweet and sour shrimp, and vegetable fried rice. everything was pretty tasty.

for dessert, i got the pineapple/coconut ice cream concoction. it was OK. 

overall, this place is fine. honestly, i don't think asian people would ever think to come here. only tourists and westerners would pay top money to eat chinese food. this wouldn't be my first choice for dinner but hey, i wasn't paying!

My guest and I arrived shortly after opening, the hours are 11am-3pm. And were promptly sat in one of the prettiest dining rooms I have ever seen, full of golds and light emerald greens. There had to have been 7 different wall papers that all matched! The chairs were embroidered with beautiful green and gold flowers, there are gold foiled walls with gorgeous branches with flowers painted on them. Okay so I know that you're(I am) here for food, you walk in to the dessert portion of the buffet first and it is as delectable looking as the SEAFOOD TOWER that is set up when you walk in to the dining room. Lobsters cut in half with claw meat stuffed into the cavity...excuse me while I drool! There were also snow crab legs and large shrimp. Various sauces surrounded the seafood including cocktail, louis, and mignonette. 

There were also cold sides- smoked salmon, spinach with soy dressing, thai beef, asparagus, truffle foie with cherries, and a delicious goat cheese tart! The warm dishes included oxtail, chinese broccoli, rosemary mixed mushrooms, prime rib, sweet potatoes, 4 different soups!!! The soups included a salted chicken congee, dan dan noodle, and a snow crab bisque(I didn't catch the 4th shame on me).....

There were a few carts roaming the dining room. One cart had dim sum the other cart had warm dishes and some fried dim sum. The dim sum was average, although this is dim sum brunch, I came for the seafood! And for the duck!!! The duck was good, it wasn't peking, the skin wasn't crisp. But, it was very flavorful!! The roasted pork belly had crazy crispy skin, we also got sticky rice dessert(nian gao) from the same cart and I recommend eating this as it brings good luck for the coming year! 

Now, DESSERT, the standouts for me were the matcha red bean cupcake and the chestnut cake! Both flavors were delivered perfectly! I didn't care for the earl grey pop or the red velvet cupcake. I was very happy to see rambutans and fresh cherries! 

All in all a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go again!

Lowlights: service, screming kids, fried rice.

My wife and I were excited to get reservation for the only Chinese restaurant in the US to be awarded a Michelin star. After attending an evening performance of Le Rêve we were looking forward to an excellent dinner.

Upon arrival, the decor reminded us of our visit to China in 2010 - lovely, authentic style and colors (red & gold). Unfortunately, the place was crawling with families with kids, which is also typical in China. We were seated between the high traffic doors and a table that was left dirty for twenty minutes before we asked to be moved. They took care of both problems by cleaning the table next to us and moving us there. Not a fabulous start.

Next, we ordered drinks, Kir Royale and Perrier-Jouët, both beautiful  choices. The sommelier was friendly and helped us select a Barbieri Syrah, which stood up well to our meal choices.

We started with the honey glazed BBQ ribs, which were very tender, but a bit mild-flavored for our tastes. This would unfortunately be a theme throughout the meal. The remaining four dishes came out at the same time and our table was too small to hold them, so they pulled the next table over for mor room. The mushrooms of five mushroom plate were beautiful and tender, but flavorless. The Yang Chau fried rice was perfectly cooked and not too greasy, but again quite bland. The sweet and sour pork was a slightly better reproduction of a mediocre fast food dish.

The best entree was the Hunan lamb, which was tender and flavorful combination of vegetables and bite sized lamb pieces. It had a slight kick and a strong ginger flavor. Here again, it was less spicy and flavored than I would have expected.

We almost didn't order desert because we thought it wouldn't be worthwhile. However, we were glad we decided to share the Lemongrass Crème Brûlée. It was incredibly delicious! The mild lemony flavor went perfectly with this creamy classic. It was served with mixed fresh berries and the most exquisite little almond macaroons. It was so good I would return just for that.

Wing Lei is modeled after top-end Chinese restaurants you will find only in Hong Kong, like at the Grand Hyatt or Mandarin hotels there, and a step above The China Club or Peking Garden. Those that aren't familiar with these places may be put back by the prices and presentation, but this is supposed to be a Hong Kong restaurant, not a Chinese restaurant (if you really have to get into semantics).

No shorts or tank tops here, but nice casual. The atmosphere is upscale, as is the service, and i later realized this is the key eatery for high rollers from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The Peking duck salad and fried potsticker appetizers were top shelf. They were so good we asked for another round before the main dishes arrived.

But.....

... that's when it all went downhill. 

The main course dishes were nice attempts, but fell far behind expectations. The 'Yung chow"" fried rice, which is a Hong Kong staple, and which is almost impossible to screw up, was dismal. My mom said it was a ""Chinese dish, but in Japanese portion"", meaning it was small, barely enough to feed a single person. Also, the rice was non-stick grain, which I can appreciate as an option for those that like non-stick rice, but the authentic dish has never veered from sticky rice.

The black-peppered beef..... tasted more English than Chinese. Hong Kong is a particular style of black-peppered dish, similar to 'au poivre', but has a blend of bernaise to bring out the flavor. The one here was.... actually hard to finish... it actually tasted like rehydrated beef jerky.

The 3 cup chicken, was ok. Interesting. Tasty, but had a soapy-like taste which is normally caused by too much or poorly-prepared ginger. But it wasn't bad, and I wouldnt' pass on it if I were offered it again, but I wouldn't be the one ordering it.

The spicy shrimp was good. It had a nice garlicky, chili-saucy base, which was probably the only main-course dish that had close resemblence to what this restaurant was trying to achieve.

The desert...... was clearly the blueprint for what you call a map of short-cuts. $10 for two mochi-mango ice-creams sliced in half? It costs $3 for a box of 10 at Trader Joe's! At least try to make it stand out with sauces or something..... but NO...... stupid people won't know the difference (NOT!).

Wing lei's donut with vanilla sauce was actually tasty...... but nothing special. 

The coconut ice-cream was good, and definately something I would order again in the future.....

.... but then comes the all-important $63 question... would I come here again?

No. I wouldn't turn it down if it was part of a larger group of invites, but I will never come back here again if I have to take charge.... UNLESS it is just for the appetizers at the bar.

It all went down hill from there. Absolutely nothing unique. I've had better Chinese food for $10 per entree in the middle of Wyoming on the side of a highway. Is there a particular reason that this cost 8x the price of the same duck hanging in your local Chinatown? 

Add insult to injury, the wine tasting included a delicious glass of J. Lohr - yes that same J. Lohr you get at any Safeway in CA for $12 per bottle. The sommelier named Diego even quipped about this being a budget wine. At this point I was starting to wonder if Charles Shaw was going to be next. 

Overall, who the hell gave these guys a Michelin star? To be sure, this is no dollar a scoop Chinese place where you're never sure if the meat is actually beef, but spend your money elsewhere. Plenty of other places to blow $200pp.",KeaqFymZFAf91PgFEHJYuQ,2,0,2,DfRhdiRp-vTw82nEeZpRGQ

After 6 nights of steak and seafood, we decided we needed a change. I caved in to my husband's wish to try Wing Lei even though I thought I was over Chinese food since I haven't had any that I really liked in years. Lord have mercy, if all Chinese food tasted like this I would have it every day. 

Be warned, this is not your local take-out place. It is a fabulous and fancy restaurant with prices to match. Although I am not sure why anyone would expect it to be anything less than expensive being a Wynn restaurant. It was worth every penny and there are no complaints from me. 

The restaurant was lovely. The waiter, his assistants, and the sommelier were amazing and provided stellar service. You probably shouldn't wear your shorts and sandals, but you definitely don't need to be in a jacket. 

I had Three Cup Chicken, my husband had Garlic Beef Tenderloin, and we shared an order of Sichuan Green Beans. Although spicy, they were the best green beans I have ever had in my life - without exaggeration. And both of our meals were packed with flavor, to the point we were both making happy noises with our mouths after each bite. (how annoying for those around us!)

The entire table opt for the duck tasting menu. If you don't like duck then this is not for you, because the tasting option consist of 6 courses (except dessert) all made with duck.

Peking duck: steamed buns with table side carved duck. The skin was perfectly crisp and the meat was tender. The hoisin sauce was tangy and sweet and completes the flavor.

Duck salad: if salads were all like this, I'd eat them everyday. There were 2 generous pieces of duck breast with skin on with a variety of greens. The vinaigrette was excellent too.

Duck soup: not what I expected but very tasty nevertheless. Clear broth with shreds of duck meat. The soup was slightly sour and spicy, very simple but delicious.

Sauteed duck: this was shared among the table. Good amount of duck stir fried with veggies. Cooked just right.

Duck fat fried rice: shared among the table as well. Smelled amazing. Elevated traditional Chinese dish by cooking with duck fat and adding minced duck meat. 

Dessert: Interesting dessert. Many different layers to it. From the crispy outter layer to the softer marshmallow like layer to the cold ice cream center. A great finish to a satisfying meal.

Overall excellent food, service and ambience. Pricy but well worth the money. I highly recommend the duck tasting menu, it's unique and definitely memorable.",ZbjYVJihYRV7VbMOMZlNWQ,3,0,5,ZV0IZKgChwrXIGwl6ArcYw

It's everything one expects from Chinese fine dining in the States, from a brightly lit dining space with pleasing painted silk screens to a golden dragon sculpture surrounded by trees accented by lighting, to perfectly pressed linens accented with gold.  Servers all well dressed in well pressed uniforms.  

The menu, loosely Cantonese with over 100 selections. .  

Tip:  Opt for one of the prefix menus and a wine pairing.  Trust.
Tip:  Use the sommelier.  Chinese food pairs with more than off dry riesling.

Etiquette notes:

- You have two sets of chopsticks.  Use the inner (black) to take food from the community plates.  Use the outer (white) to eat.  Never take food from a community plate and put it directly in your mouth. 

- Never lick or bite, point to other with, cross, spear food, mix community plates searching, pass food between, use as drum sticks, or stick upright in a bowl of rice your chopsticks unless you want a Chinese grandmother in the room to slap you upside your head.

The food:  Imperial Peking Duck Tasting Menu:

Stunning use of a duck (roughly 1/2 served per person).  Each dish makes best use of parts of the duck.  The wine pairing, incredible and further adds to the flavor of each dish. 

Peking duck - hybrid wrapper, cross between the traditional wrap and the fluffy fermented steam bun.  House made hoisin sauce.  Carved tableside.  Mostly skin with some breast meat. Though the skin lacks the ethereal crispness of true Peking duck, it is well seasoned.  Perfect pairing to a sweet, cognac infused cassis liquor that blends harmoniously with the fruity/fermented notes of the sauce.

Duck salad - a thick slice of breast meat with its shin attached sits atop a crisp pastry filled with a chunky duxelles of shiitake mushrooms and black truffle.  Foie and truffle is spread between the duck and pastry.  Salad dressed with a very pronounced peanut dressing.  Refreshing, the flavors play off each other.  Accompanying austere French white adds acidity.

Duck and foie pot stickers on heirloom carrot purée.  Stunning. The wrap, firm.  Bite in and melting foie fat and duck jus bursts forth like an XLB.  The ducks meaty earthiness is greatly enhanced.  Both blend perfectly with the sweet carrot purée. The accompanying young Sauternes, a classic match.

Duck fried rice with Chinese sausage and Jidori egg.  Outstanding. Wok hei very evident.  Sweet peas and peppers have been added at the last minute to retain their crisp texture and freshness.   It sits alongside a stir-fry of young skinless eggplant and the remaining boneless duck meat seasoned with hint of black bean sauce.  And accompanying, light Italian Pinot, great match.  Acidity cutting through the fat.

Cherry sphere - milk chocolate surrounded by a black cherry reduction shell around the lightest ""cheese cake"".  Tart cherries make up the core.  Perfect with a sparkling wine from the south of France.

Excellent service.

The price: $108.88 +$48.88 wine pairing.

It was a steep $68.88, but only happens a couple times a year.  Was it worth the MONEY?  I think yes!

The first thing you will notice is the MOUNTAIN of halved Lobster, King Crab claws and large prawn/shrimp!

They also had Tomahawk Ribeye at the carving station, but with all the seafood options, I really didn't want to fill up on beef!

A couple mentionables :

Lobster Salad with Yuzu Ponzu. This was PERFECT! Tender and flavorful Lobster and greens without an overbearing Yuzu flavor.  One of the best things worthy of seconds and thirds!

Duck Prosciutto and Asian Pear. This was delicious and a surprisingly good combination of sweet and savory.  Much better than I initially expected :)

The dim sum choices were limited but excellent in taste and quality of ingredients.  Examples :

Shark Fin Dumplings were AWESOME.  One of the only dim sum choices I asked for seconds/thirds.  Lobster Dumplings were good, but not nearly as yummy!

Crispy Pork Belly was out of this world! The skin had a crisp creme-brulee-candy-coating like consistency...BEST I've had so far!  

The BEST Baked BBQ Pork Bao...very good!  Slightly sweet, crumbly top with a delicious pork goodness inside!  I will forever compare the others to this example :)

Tea Smoked Duck. Wonderful! So much flavor in each bite!  The BBQ Pork was also delicious!  Small portions but big flavor.

And tons of dessert options...my favorites were the Crispy Praline Nutella and Chocolate Mousse.

Couple complaints (besides the entry price of course) :

Wish they served melted butter for the lobster.  It was simply steamed and could have used a bit more seasoning/flavor/butter.

The raw oysters had shell/sand and were not enjoyable.  

The scallops were good but had an odd coloring to them.  Not sure if that's how they were cooked, or if they were of poor quality.

Overall, I would recommend it for a splurge!  Just not sure if I will be back again for next time :)",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,0,4,UyQsmJoHDthlNlaVsp6usQ

Food - the food was below mediocre for the most part like Kung Pao Chicken and Hunan Chicken. The 3 Cup Sea Bass was excellent though. Portions are regular but the presentation was not what you'd expect from a Michelin star restaurant.

Decor - the decor of the restaurant lives up to the Wynn standards but if you're looking for a great experience, maybe you're better off picking up another restaurant in Wynn.

Service - Surprisingly the service was a huge let down. We were in at 7:10 and got our appetizers by 7:40. The food however didn't arrive till 8:20 and the order was given as the same time as appetizers so that was very poor service. The only explanation given was that  there was a large party before us and hence the delay! We had to leave for a show so we literally had to stuff ourselves and box the rest. Usually when there is a delay like this the chef sends something in the meantime with his compliments, but nothing of that sort even happened. This really ruined the 30th Bday celebrations and left is highly disappointed. I told our server this after we paid and he hardly seemed to care. 

Overall, it took me 2 days to find something I didn't like about Wynn. Sadly it had to be during a special occasion like my wife's 30th birthday!

Wing Lei has a decent selection of Chinese food but most items are the typical American known ones - which isn't a bad thing. I love honey walnut shrimp and sweet and sour chicken every now and then and they make it great here. The prices, however, make me less likely to recommend or come back here. We had shrimp sashimi style (I know, a bit out of the norm to get at a Chinese style resturaunt) and it was $16 per shrimp.. Plus, when you order Peking Duck, they cut it up for you and each person only gets one bun+meat and the rest they chop up and stir fry and put it into a lettuce bun, which to be fair, is good but I think I'd choose two Peking duck buns over 1 bun and 1 lettuce wrap. I will say all items we ordered were very good and the staff is very friendly, attentive, and accomodating, but you can definitely go somewhere less pricey for just as good (if not better and more aunthentic) Chinese food.

Officially the first Chinese restaurant in the United States to ever garner a Michelin Star, Wing Lei had literally been on my bucket list for 5 years when a friend informed me of their twice-yearly dim-sum brunch, the $68.88 feast featuring both hot carts and a full buffet of items both traditional Chinese and Americanized fare in the gorgeous, gilded, and newly renovated room at Wynn.  Generally not particularly interested in buffets given the lackluster quality of ingredients plus intrinsic flaws related to large-scale production and hot plates it was with good faith that I presumed a team the likes of that at Wing Lei would do a stellar job with sourcing as well as preparation and true to form from the moment our party of three arrived it would be hard to find fault in any aspect of the afternoon as the setting, food, and service shined.  A no reservations affair playing host to a mixture of young and old, Asian and Caucasian, it was with dim sum that the majority of tables began and with carts circulating at intervals of no more than ten minutes each and every item arrived hot and fresh, the offerings shining with delicate shark's fin, snappy lobster, and textbook har gow amongst the most impressive steamed items while fried taro root dumplings, juicy XLB, and crispy duck plus pork belly with a crackling crème brulee skin also wowed.  Moving next to the vast expanse of items both hot and cold, it was in the soup station that I found two of my favorites - the congee as rich and textural as the bisque proved buttery and sweet (if not particularly Chinese at all) - while split 1.5lb lobsters, King Crab Claws, and prepared to order sushi was all immaculate, an easy place for those so inclined to more than make up for the cost of entry.  Focusing less on steam-tray hot items but very impressed by cured duck balanced by sliced pears, fatty yet supple Tomahawk chop, and tender grilled scallops, meaty sea bass, plus lobster salad in delicate ponzu it was at last to desserts that I moved and sampling each one of the sweets it would be difficult to say which I enjoyed the most as the dense caramel coffee crunch and coconut lychee financier were as good as any similar dessert served on the strip, yet given the choice to revisit just one item it was to the Yuzu Cheesecake dipped in White Chocolate that I returned - the creamy center with light citrus and a smooth chocolate shell redefining a dessert I rarely, if ever, order on a restaurant menu.  Undoubtedly a decadent brunch but also a case where I feel I got exactly what I paid for suffice it to say I can't wait for the Year of the Sheep...and more exploration of Vegas' wide selection of Asian cuisines, both casual and upscale, in the interim.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,5,ubZLzNyws9L-bSQXMijdMw

Lastly, the food was outstanding. We weren't too adventurous in our dining selections- just the basics: General Tso chicken, chow main, and fried rice.

As an avid tea drinker, they served us a complimentary cup of tea right before our meal. It wasn't a loose-leaf tea, nor was it made with a tea bag. Just a small raspberry colored capsule. It was a very nice touch!

But, Wing Lei did not disappoint. Is it easy on the wallet? Absolutely not. The food alone likely doesn't justify the price - but, the combination of the food, service and opulent atmosphere makes this place totally worth it. 

Let's start with the restaurant. It's absolutely gorgeous. Opulent. Dim lighting with tons of creams and golds. Beautiful, without being overdone. We were lucky to get a table close to the windows, with the views of the dragon and the trees. The service was also quite good - I love the little chair for my purse. It's totally over the top and amazing. 

To start, we ordered the chilled vegetable roll, the potstickers and the honey-glazed barbecue spare ribs. The chilled vegetable roll was so-so, but the potstickers and ribs were amazing. The potstickers were pan-seared on the bottom, and were served in these really cute individual baskets. The ribs were the star of the show though. These were fall off the bone, sticky, sweet, tangy, delicious ribs. I would order this to myself next time. To die for. 

For entrees, we shared the mu shu pork, general tao's chicken, and yang chow fried rice. Everything was spot on. I love how the mu shu pork is served in scallion pancakes. I didn't know we could have five-star general tao's chicken, but it is possible. The chicken was incredibly tender, with super thin breading. The sauce was delicious. The dessert was disappointing though - we had the rice pudding and it wasn't very good at all. The presentation was gorgeous, but the taste just wasn't there. 

I also loved how the restaurant brings a little dessert platter on the house, with tiny macarons, jellies, caramels and chocolates. The macaron was on par with the macarons in France. Very delicate, with a delicious filling. Amazing how they could fit the taste into such a small macaron.

The restaurant does this special one between Christmas to western New Year and then once again for the eastern New Year.

The spread is impressive even by Wynn standards. Once sat, tea service is offered and the dim sum carts are rolled out. All the usual favorites are on there; black bean spareribs, chicken feet, har gow, sui mai, char sui bao, soup dumplings, and more. The soup dumplings and the shrimp balls with soup in them were some definite highlights. Besides the usual suspects, they had more high end items like sharks fin dumplings as well. 

Once past the small plates, everything came in abundance. It was like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in the main dining room. As far as the eye could see, an endless feast of roasted duck, halved lobster, king crab claws, prawns, sushi, handmade noodles, and other Asian favorites. Think you can finish a meal without dessert? Forget about it. If the carts did not get to you with the Chinese desserts than a walk through the foyer with have you up to your eyes in fusion items.

Hot foods included salt & pepper chicken wings, curry beef, shrimp chow fun, beef fried rice, bok choy, black bean sea bass, duck.  I loved the black bean sea bass.  They also featured dim sum carts, but the carts are very minimal with only 1 cart passed around every 30-45 minutes.  The cart variety was not wide enough.  Most of the cart items were different varieties of dumplings.  Furthermore, most of the items on the carts were lukewarm to room temperature.

The service was inconsistent, with some servers being outstanding and others would totally forget that they had said they would bring a requested item.  I was surprised they had no drawn butter for the crab claws and lobster.

Being a huge dim sum fan, I was really excited to try the brunch and I wanted to love it.  But it fell short of a $70 brunch (that didn't include any alcohol).

Walnut Prawns were pretty good, strange to have such a large prawn used in this dish but was cooked well, it was fresh, however, needed a bit more flavor.  The hot pot cod was the highlight, soft, flavorful and great texture.  The duck crepe appetizer was a very good start as well.  After that everything was either bland, cold, or just seriously something you could get at a regular chinese restaurant.

I gorged myself silly and left a mess of shells, bamboo baskets, and crumpled napkins in my wake.  Shit, there are only a couple of days left and I'm contemplating calling out sick from work just to go again.

Get there early!  Saturday 2/17 was the only day our group could go and was absolute prime time for CNY.  I spoke with a host a few days prior and was told the line started at 10am until doors opened at 11am.  Fellow Yelper Emily R and her boyfriend got there just a bit before ten and were first (thank you!!).  By the time we entered, the line was around 40 people deep.  I also ended up running into Jennifer H a bit later, who put her name down at noon and was told the wait was 2 hours.  Around 12:45 was when I somehow magically made room for the dessert section near the hostess table, overheard people being turned away and being told they were sold out.

Crush lobster.  It'll be the quickest way to get your money's worth and they were fucking delicious.  The seafood display, also filled with snow crab and shrimp, promptly displayed at the front was stupendous.  Can every room I enter have this setup???  I started calling the attendant ""Daddy"" since I was up there so often!  Even having said all this, I still regret not eating more of it. 

The dim sum cart offerings were excellent with standouts including dumplings like the shrimp and truffle topped with gold to the fattiest (in a good way) pork belly and its perfectly crispy skin.  I also enjoyed their soup station that served congee, various noodle broths and a rich, hearty snow crab soup.

We went here as a group of 5 for dinner tonight and were seated immediately in a very beautiful dining room with someone of the most elegant decor I've seen in Vegas.

We started off with the Wing Lei Sampler. The Shrimp Toast was just ok. The BBQ spare ribs were very tender and tasted nice. The King Crab Salad was phenomenal. It was probably one of the best appetizers and best crab dishes I've ever had. The mango and avocado worked so beautifully with the crab that was dressed with a citrusy miso-yuzo. This for me was the best dish of the night because everything went downhill from here on. 

We also got the Chilled Vegetable Roll. It didn't really taste of anything. It was really bland and needed a heavy hit of chili sauce.

The Walnut Prawns were really bland and had no flavor. The prawns were big and juicy and well cooked, the almonds were crisp but overall the dish could have been a little sweeter and a little zingy. Chinatown in Seattle where I live honestly do a better job with this dish. 

The Mu Shu pork was ok. It wasn't spectacular but wasn't bad. With a little bit of the sauce and some chili paste that we requested, it was alright. 

The Mapo Tofu was really nice. It had a spicy kick to it and was really palatable. I really liked it.

The Lemon Chicken was such a fail. It was a really dry, over-cooked and under-seasoned fried chicken breast with a sweet sticky sauce on the side that didn't smell or taste of lemons. I was expecting it to be fresh, vibrant, zingy with some zest but it was none of those things. Easily the worst dish of the night.

One of us was a vegetarian and he got the Veg Fried Rice and the Three Cup Eggplant which he said he liked. 

Then was the most awaited and the most disappointing dish of the night. The Imperial Peking Duck. We had been talking about this all day and was the first thing we ordered. Somehow they totally forgot about the order and we waited for an hour after the rest of the food came before finally asking them about it when we saw other tables getting theirs. The server insisted that we never actually ordered it, and that we just discussed it. That's impossible because we all remember it being the first thing that we ordered since it was the reason we chose to come to Wing Mei in the first place. Eventually when the duck came out 20 minutes later, they carved it table side, another aspect we were excited about and really looking forward to. They carved up about a fourth of the duck, places it onto a plate, then wrapped it in the Mandarin Crepes with scallions and hoisin sauce and served those. They covered the rest and took it back in saying it was for the second course. When they brought out the second course, it was basically lettuce cups with a lot of diced up garnishes, what tasted like maybe water chestnuts and some other things and a little bit of duck.
While the crepes tasted really good and the lettuce cups were ok, what was really disappointing and unexpected was that after charging $100 for the duck, they don't even actually serve you the full duck, just a very small portion of it. I wonder if the rest is taken back in to make some of their other duck salads and dishes with but I was really let down by that because I genuinely love roast duck and this was really nicely done. 

They brought us out a small plate with a few mini dessert samplers at the end of the meal because we were not in the mood to wait any longer and order any more.

Overall with the average food for the most part, the mistakes in the service and the overall experience, I'm very disappointed. This is definitely not what I expected from a Michelin Star restaurants. For a normal average-joe restaurant I would rate this dinner as 3 stars but with those really premium prices, I expect nothing but the best and would not hesitate in being more severe with the feedback. 2 stars for a disappointing evening. I don't think I would go back here or recommend it to people.",zvc8SwnDxwTInJ9fx0Itmg,5,1,2,8N77uQuK3w9w6HDZhx3arQ
5697769,2015-02-20,1,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"Wing Lei is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the world and a well-deserved Michelin star restaurant. Since it is located in the Wynn and a Michelin star restaurant, the prices are high and you get what you pay for.

The decoration inside is amazing. I have visited the restaurant years back when it wasn't decorated in gold but the new look makes it a much classier restaurant. I love the different shades of gold and even commented on how I want to get the same curtains for my house! 

Now on to the food: because I have been to Wing Lei so many times, I know exactly what I want. The only thing I order off the menu is the Peking Duck. Everything else I order is off the menu: shark fin soup, steamed fish, huge boiled santa barbara prawns, sampan style crab. These are more traditional Chinese dishes offered at typical Cantonese seafood restaurants and Wing Lei has these on point! 

I tried their desserts for the first time this week also and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee is OUT OF CONTROL. It was probably one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life so I definitely recommend it.

I want to start out by saying it a Michelin Star rated restaurant which means it is TRUE fine dining. These are not handed out like candy (or in Vegas' case, the flyers for call girls on the streets).

Upon entering Wing Lei you feel like you are in a Chinese palace. You are immediately greeted by friendly yet personally hosts. I happened to come here by myself which felt sort of awkward initially but ended up being fine. Once you're escorted to your table will you find yourself looking around the restaurant admiring the accents of red and gold before realizing that your ""silverware"" is actually gold. The place is undoubtedly tasteful...to the point where even all of the patrons were dressed appropriately (this is rare in Vegas).

I started with mixed vegetable in a lettuce cup. They were so amazing that they could have been an entree. However, my fried rice entree was the most spectacular fried rice I have ever had the pleasure of eating in my life.

So I had to get the duck. But instead of having them chop it up and put it in lettuce cups i told them to just chop it up and give it to me. I loved the dual preparation of the peking wth both the buns and crepe though. And the duck seemed to have hardly any fat on it which was surprising since duck is normally fatty. It was the best duck I have eaten

I also ordered the lobster, mongolian beef, a fish course and some green beans and the corn and crab soup. The crab in the soup was big chunks of blue lump crab.

5778814,2012-01-06,1,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"Review is only for their new year dim sum brunch - completely worth the $60! 

I've wanted to do Wing Lei's dim sum brunch buffet for years but was holding out for a comp. Finally gave in and just paid since I'm moving and now I regret not doing it sooner. I feel like I cheated myself out of a yearly treat - this is one of the few pricier buffets where I don't even question that it was worth it. Enjoyed it more than the $100 Sterling brunch (but no Perrier jouet or other booze included). 

The dining room is so understated and elegant, everything was beautiful and very calming. The tables were spaced far apart, but I hated the throne like chairs - so heavy and awkward to scoot in. Although since its fine dining, they probably push the chair in for you at a typical dinner service. 

No need to flag the carts down since they keep a good eye for new diners and empty plates. They were a little too pushy about having us try some of everything, but just say no. They seemed to have the usual assortment of steamed, fried or baked dim sum but everything was done with high quality ingredients and the flavors were amazing. My favs were the siu mai, crispy roast pork belly, scallop dumpling and baked char siu bao. 

They also had a sushi bar with a small selection of nigiri made to order and California rolls (surprisingly made w imitation crab vs real). Didn't try the carving station w rack of lamb, sampled some of the small cold dishes but only the beef carpaccio stood out as exceptional. 

The chilled seafood was kind of a big disappointment -they had king crab, raw oysters, shrimp, and split whole lobsters. Shrimp looked like the frozen stuff you get anywhere, the lobster was awkward to plate with legs and antenna all over the place and then it was pretty dry and tasteless. Crab sucked too. I wasn't really in the mood for seafood anyway, but it was disappointing. 

I was impressed with the hand stretched noodles for their soup, but the broth was tasteless even garnished with ground pork and other things. I'm not into congee but they had that too. 

Hot dishes were kind of a fail - most looked dried out and I don't think any were memorable on taste. They had Singapore noodles, lup cheong fried rice, Asian seabass (not Chilean), chili tomato prawns, country style duck, some kind of beef, and a couple things I can't remember. 

Dessert selection wasn't huge but they had some good options. Coconut pudding was my fav, other goodies were white chocolate mousse thing, chocolate ice cream, passion fruit mousse thing. 

I honestly don't know why I feel I got my moneys worth when a lot of the offerings were far from perfect. The amazing dim sum combined with the atmosphere and excellent service just did it for me I guess.

I'm not sure on the dates they offer this brunch during the holidays, last day was 1/2, but they also have it every day for about a month during Chinese New Year in Feb.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,3,1,4,dnXLVdoxPAatJZ0PwOrBYA

5806995,2007-06-22,0,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"This is Wynn's upscale Chinese restaurant. It's named after Mr. Wynn, in some fashion or other.

Wing Lei offers some familiar dishes, and some not so familiar. A page focusing on Cantonese specialties includes such ingredients as beef tendon, belly pork, jelly fish, fish maw, and goose web. Prices range from moderate (many entrees are around $30) to immoderate (Australian Coral Cod runs $99/pound).

The atmosphere is formal. Red and gold abounds. The carpet is a mix of cream, gray, black, and light blue. Moderately soft music (sometimes Chinese, sometimes not) plays in the background. The view outside is of two gnarled (pomegranate?) trees and a large sculpture that might be a Botero. On my table was a single red rose in an igloo-like base. Chop sticks and flatware are gold.

I began with the Wing Lei Sampler. Prawns with black bean sauce consisted of two large shrimp, barely cooked through, with a mild sauce; pretty good. Minced squab in lettuce cups was just that: minced squab and mushrooms with a small amount of sauce that must have included Hoisin sauce. A thin vegetable spring roll was crisp and very good. Overall, a good appetizer, albeit not very adventurous.

The adventurous part would be my entree. I decided to try something a little different. Braised Pork Belly is the same cut of pork used in bacon. Served in chunks about 1.5 inches square and a quarter inch thick, it was braised in some sort of flavorful liquid, and had the appearance of warm raw bacon, somewhat darkened by the sauce. Ah, but looks can be deceiving. It was quite flavorful, and just chewy enough to be pleasing. Accompanying it were slices of shiitake mushroom and chunks of daikon and bamboo shoot. A very interesting, very good dish. If you're a little adventurous, and can get past the thought of chewing hunks of bacon fat, I'd recommend it highly.

Dessert would be more familiar. Chocolate Dome was well named. Dark chocolate ganache covered a hemispherical chocolate nut center - similar to mousse, but thicker. A little creme anglaise and chocolate sauce covered the plate. Very good, but then I'm a chocoholic.

With dessert, a little tea. Wing Lei offers a menu of teas that are lovingly described. Now, my knowledge of tea ends with green-versus-black, but it was fun to read the descriptions, and try to figure out what each tea would be like. I finally settled on Ti Kuan Yin, the ""Ultimate Oolong. Picked by trained monkeys."" It had a pleasant aroma, good, light flavor, and none of the bitterness I associate with tea (but then, when I make tea, I get out my box of 3 year old tea bags, and stick the bag in a cup of boiling water until I remember to remove it). Now about those trained monkeys: I have a feeling there might have been a slight problem in the translation to English. As I understand it ""monkey picked"" is the term, and it refers to a top quality grade.


Based on conflicting reviews on the web, I hadn't been sure what to expect. I read one intriguing review which stated that some of the specialties were excellent, while some of the standard Chinese choices were no better than you'd get at a carry out. All I know for sure is that my meal at Wing Lei was very satisfying.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,4,3,4,r9hi-2UZPm5Va9iYQb58Mg

While Wing Lei did not exceed the expectations, the restaurant certainly met it. As a precautionary tale, the food here can be very expensive depending on what you order. Here is a list of what I had:

Peking Duck: This dish is as much of a treat as it is a show. The chef carts the duck next to your table, where he carves the skin off into either buns or crepe. Even though I am from San Gabriel (a very asian area with many asian food), the duck around San Gabriel does not measure up to the duck at Wing Lei. The skin is crispy, and the bun is soft and fluffy. Each other comes with 8, so with a group of 4 we each had 2.

Sharkfinn Soup: Wing Lei has 2 types of sharkfinn soup, a traditional one with brown broth and one with crab meat. Both were incredible, although I thought the crab meat in the second soup was flavorful and actually better.

Steamed Fish: Wow. The fish was fresh and soft. If you've ever had steamed fish, you can tell that this restaurant really nailed it. The clean feeling you have after eating it is indescribable.

An amuse bouche of Watermelon with Ginger & Infused Fresh Herbs had a unique flavor, followed by Pan-Fried Pork Pot Stickers served in little flower baskets.  Partly to satisfy my desires, and also to test the capabilities and desire to please with exemplary service of the restaurant staff, I requested Hoisin Sauce, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Chili Oil, Pot Sticker Sauce, and ginger for Pot Sticker adornment, and quickly received all items from our gracious server May.  Seafood Hot & Sour Soup was a first for me--and a delicious one, with large shrimps and beautifully cooked scallops.  For my entree I again selected medium rare Garlic Beef Tenderloin accompanied by Yang Chow Fried Rice with shrimp, BBQ pork, egg, and scallions.  The beef was tender and delicious; the protein-rich rice on point, and Heirloom Bell Peppers, Sugar Peas, and Mushroom slices nice additions to the main course.  Meanwhile Diane greatly enjoyed her Fried Prawns with Candied Walnuts & Honey Sauce.

For dessert I found Vanilla and Mango Mochi Ice Cream to be cool and refreshing, while Diane sampled a few complimentary offerings like a Chocolate Cake Petit For and an Almond Cookie.  All was enhanced by seemingly endless cups of fragrant Aromatic Iron Buddha Oolong Hot Tea.

The area was not large, but they also had a broth noodle section (not special), sushi area (good), some cold small bites, and the middle island area has hot food, but nothing stood out.  My husband said that his steamed sea bass, which I thought was good, had a freezer burn taste.  The dessert section was cute.  There was a good variety of small items, but my faves were the shots of coffee flavored mousse with coffee jelly, the lemon cake lollipop, the chocolate squares (different variety, we had the coconut and the dark chocolate, and both were delicious), and the caramel and some fruit soft candy in plastic wrappers.  The green tea cake with raspberry was dry (this includes the dessicated berry garnish) and the chocolate cake lollipop was too rich.  It cost about $200 for two ppl with tip and taxes incl.  My husband thought it was the best buffet he's been to in Vegas yet, and we've been to all the big ones and M casino's.  I'm not big on seafood, so it still gets a 3 star from me.",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,0,0,3,Ez9iM9AIEti0_JhT_eYNmA

What the heck, reviews were good and we were excited about a different taste profile and a fresh experience.  Dinner reservations were made for very early evening.  We arrived on time and were shown to a very nice table.  Front of the house staff were friendly and courteous.  We were immediately greeted and our cocktail order was taken and then the waiting began.  Keep in mind there were no more than 5 tables and the bar was empty.  We waiting and we waited.  Finally my cocktail came and my wife was still waiting.  Actually the waiter came over and took our order before my wife was even served a drink.  Now lets get down to the nitty gritty.  The sweet and sour soup was excellent. The crab egg rolls are a JOKE.  A COMPLETE JOKE.  In reality they are nothing more than a casing rolled around a microscopic portion of crab.  The entire cylinder is not more than 1/4 inch in diameter.  REALLY????? Is this what you are about?  My wife ordered the beef tenderloin and SPECIFICALLY ASKED IF THE BEEF WAS SLICED.  The waiter assured us it was.  The beef was no more sliced than I am Madonna!  It was chunks of improperly cooked and dry beef.  SAD.  However my sea bass was excellent.  The fried rice was underwhelming at best.  Much better at any carry out place in Vegas.  Ambiance is some where between an operating room (all white) and a baseball game with a ridiculous amount of lighting.  No mystic, no romance, no nothing for $250.00.  Staff was great. But this place is sadly not in the pantheon of Wynn or Encore properties....  Sad but true..",qa7MwLRUsEw3NRDVQ0T2vg,0,0,1,jx_UHTS4H9BuXTQQhMty8Q
5941597,2012-11-04,0,fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ,"Wow this place blew my mind.  While I was staying at the Wynn they comped all our food so of course we ate a lot...ok constantly.  This was definitely my favorite spot.  Even ordered tons of food to go so we could enjoy it in our room and walking the strip.  

Somewhere I could never afford to eat normally, I took full advantage and tried just about everything.  If there is a heaven, this restaurant should probably be there.  

Not only is it delicious, but the presentation makes you feel that you are eating somewhere very classy.  I can't wait to go back.  Makes my mouth water every time I think about it.",Bqx48CAa9GqoyPi4Nmdp-Q,1,0,5,VMBzrsJKABkRh0GkHJHaVQ

But as I was about to pay the bill and leave for the theatre a party of four was seated next to us. Looked like a family: I'd guess 2 grandparents, a father, and a son about 10 years of age. The kid had a couple of electronic toys that made lots of noise. At one point I couldn't hear the conversation at my own table. On my way out I drew this to the attention of the staff who apologized for the noise. I wonder why a classy place like this allows things to come to this. I don't want to listen to other people's hellions. An unpleasant end to an otherwise excellent meal.",d_mmCY0--EVioj4q9ugYHg,0,0,2,Xyw_hNmvsIK38AzzuwjTyQ
