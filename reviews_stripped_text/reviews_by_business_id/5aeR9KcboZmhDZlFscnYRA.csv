41578,2012-09-14,0,5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,"Let me just start off by saying I'm not a vegetarian and so may review may not pertain to everyone. I went in thinking that it would be a good healthy place to go. The environment was really chill and I loved the garden place. 

I looked at the menu and decided on a dragon mint twist and Thai wrap. I had actually had a great vegan burrito before so I assumed the wrap would be up to standards. 

When I got it I just kind of looked at it and thought I could have made this at home. Later, when I went home with the wrap my Grandma asked why I would buy a spring roll. Being from an Asian family I commonly make spring rolls and that's pretty much what the wrap was. Except with less flavor and sadly no meat. I guess it had better ingredients than a regular spring roll but I would have rather gone to a pho house and eaten something bigger and cheaper.

The smoothie was okay in flavor but I wasn't really into how chunky it was. I'm kind of sure the chunkiness was on purpose. I didn't really like the mint leaves, lime rinds, and other unknown chunks. 

Overall, I don't think I would go back and the place just wasn't for me. Though I'm sure vegetarians would probably have a different opinion.",sz61eoq8nG05J-UMnpeClA,0,0,3,yFS2Ea5DGzgNK7nnklugMg

When I got my wrap and smoothie I couldnt believe it was 10.00. I have eaten at plenty of vegan places where they give you a full meal. My wrap was bite size. A quarter of the size of a normal wrap somewhere else. To top it off, it was frozen. I guess they made it early and had it in their fridge/freezer. I can understand premaking items at times but dont serve someone an item that has ice all over it. It was the thai wrap. I couldnt eat it right away because it was frozen to the garnishes. I had to wait for it to thaw out, no lie. The wrap was ok.. the dipping sauce was good though. I would recommend adding some more spices and flavors to the actual item and not premaking these too far in advance. Also bigger sizes. It doesnt have to be massive.

Ive been here a total of 3 times and have tried a couple of their blends. Their green juice, jungle storm, is great! Good vegetable to fruit ratio, they dont skimp on amounts of vegetable either.

The Coco Cat Cow is also great. When I drink it I can't believe that this thing is healthy for me! Amazon power is good, but not my favorite.

999236,2014-01-28,0,5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,"I first started coming to Fresh Mama because I go to classes at Vegas Hot upstairs, and I always want something refreshing yet filling after class. 

Sweet Peach Smoothie:
I've tried a couple of smoothies, and I've found my favorite recently - Sweet Peach (peach, banana, coconut water, and sunwarrior protein powder)! I've never liked the taste/texture of protein powder, and this one is no exception. However, after a few sips, I usually don't notice the protein powder anymore. The peach and banana combo makes it perfectly sweet and fruity. 

Spicy Thai Wrap: 
I've only gotten one wrap here, the Spicy Thai Wrap, and I don't think I need to try anything else, just this one will keep me coming back!  The wrap has lots of veggies, mango chucks, and jalapeno chucks The mango chucks add a hint of sweet and sour, while the jalapeno gives it a nice kick! However, the best part of this wrap is the tahini almond butter dipping sauce. It is legit the BEST dipping sauce I've ever had, I can eat just about anything with this dipping sauce. 

Disclaimer: I'm nowhere close to being a vegetarian or even a healthy eater, so it's surprising to me that I like the food here so much. It's not for my everyday diet since there's no meat, but I do look forward to the delicious and healthy Spicy Thai Wrap once or twice a week after my hot yoga classes!",U0IkjNtO0YZA6H3oreNKyQ,3,1,4,9p2uUxKZ5tECAffielXZdg

It's beautiful interior is very soothing.
I frequent the hot yoga place upstairs but I was running errands and decided to finally stop in for a smoothie.
Not knowing what to order I was glad there were three customers in front of me.

I took a pic of the smoothie menu (see pics). Smoothies or juice fills me up so I opted not to order a wrap or sides. I have a fab juicer at home and I live close but I just HAD to try this place.

Glancing at the smoothie menu I decided on an Energy Boost category one called the Hawaiian Tortoise but I chose to minus pineapple add cucumber. At first glance I'm thinking $7.99 for a smoothie WOW. But they only have one size and the customers in front of me were getting theirs and it looked BIG. :D

The young guy at the register looks perturbed and he honestly never looked me in the eye. Odd. He said ""$7.99"" and those were the only words he spoke the whole time. I took my $2.01 change and dropped it in the tip jar. Oh well.

He put on gloves and made my yummy smoothie in a dash. With the substitutions in place, it was a perfect blend of smooth ice and tons of spinach. There honestly might have been $5 worth of spinach in it :) 

The taste was not bitter nor sweet it was actually perfect. It filled me up for lunch and I was still full around dinner time! YUM!

Taking one more glance around the place and noticed people on their computers and a few more yogis coming in straight from class.

I walked to my car and while I was in my car taking a pic of my smoothie (see pics) the cashier came flying out the front door eager to light a cigarette LOL! Odd. 

I guess that's why he was not in the mood to talk or even say thanks LOL!!!!!!!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,1,1,4,wA0BKKSXg0ZtnX1OYO50TQ

1506546,2013-02-18,0,5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,"I absolutely love healthy food places so it saddens me to give this place 3 stars. Fresh Mama has a variety of healthy wraps vegan and veggie and different kinds of smoothies. They also have kale chips for the road and other prepped goods such as chia seed meal with fruits. 

When we walked in the menu we learned was outdated. They don't have the combo special anymore for $9.99. 

The menu they have up on the board is not detailed enough, it just has the names of the items but doesn't say what exactly is IN those items. They do however have ONE laminate that does have a full menu that has the items + descriptions of the items. 

Some lady in line behind us just came up and took it from us before we were even done looking at it. :( 

The food: We ordered two wraps, the baja wrap and the verdi florentine wrap. The baja wrap was in ezekiel sprout wrap and it was okay, kind of bland. The verdi florentine wrap was made with a collard green wrap and it was full of hummus and red bell pepper. 
Both weren't that great they had flavor but I don't think the ingredients fully complimented eachother. For $9.99 each, I don't think I'd be back for them. 

The place: was a mess and dirty. ALL of the seating area had crumbs everywhere. The whole area was just uncomfortable and I wanted to sit down and maybe take my laptop out, but I just felt like it was unwelcoming. 

The only thing that we ordered that we actually liked was the coco cat cow smoothie made with carob and chunks of coconut. It was pretty good. 

Overall, this place has a good idea, because I like healthy food, but I don't think I'd be back for the wraps, but I'll try the prepped foods.",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,2,0,3,5OpW1o2qCOywE-FXteTUNg
1534341,2013-02-19,0,5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,"I was looking for a place that had salad wraps.  Many moons ago, when I was a student at UNLV, before the new and current MSU, we had a really awesome place in our old MSU that had the BEST salad wraps.  I forever miss that place.  I found this place on yelp and saw it had good reviews and decided to try it out and satisfy my craving.  

What I didn't realize was this was a raw/vegan place.  Which is fine because I'm not a huge meat eater AT ALL and I actually do make a lot of vegetarian and vegan meals for myself.  Anyway, I was worried my friend wouldn't like anything here.  We got the baja wrap (for me) and the thai spicy wrap (for her), and we both LOVED it.  My baja wrap was very flavorful.  The only downside is I think the wrap is also gluten free (which is great because I'm gluten intolerant), so it crumbles easily and this ""wrap"" became a great mess (grab a bunch of napkins!).  

We also got the cheesy kale chips.  Both wraps and the kale chips came out to $20.",D4Yywoe-WrRw-evn48vWng,0,2,4,308-sAl3SEZ-vMmCh3lASQ
1976624,2014-02-13,1,5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,"Underwhelming, even with a Groupon.
For starters, this place is difficult to find- by the time you see the green sign, you've missed the entrance to the parking lot and need to pull a U-turn. And then the parking lot in front is a dead-end, so you end up having to pull back in then back out again to leave.

But if you're seeking this place out, it's for their product, not their parking lot.
Smoothies and wraps sound good to me, but even perusing their menu online showed me that their prices were a little ridiculous- wouldn't go back without a Groupon, that's for sure.

It's interesting to view their changing prices via the pictures here on Yelp- less than a year ago they were $2 less for a drink or a wrap. Produce prices haven't gone up so far to justify that, but whatever.

I ultimately got a 24oz Jungle Storm smoothie- their Groupon deals are available in $10 denominations, but when I asked what I could add to my order, they didn't really have an answer. I thought I'd grab a raw dessert from the refrigerated case, but when i realized it was $5 for a cinnamon ""bun"" that was about the size of a can-lid, I declined and did a coconut water instead.

Both drinks were served in plastic cups with plastic lids and a straw. The coconut water was literally poured out of a jug and into my cup. The smoothie was okay though- but nothing special.

I get the feeling this place is only in business because they are adjacent to a yoga studio, but even so I'm pretty sure the only reason their prices are so high is to turn a profit- they don't seem to get much other traffic.

As an additional note, there were five employees present. And none of them were smiling, happy, or friendly. 

On the bright side, despite the odd exterior, the inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a giant, decorated tree in the middle- the tables and chairs are nice, appear carefully-selected, and there is a lot of room to dine in if you choose to do so.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,4,2,Ookam3CDd-PcljG5i988Qw

As someone who prepares living foods, I truly appreciate all the very hard work that goes into making the food. This is undoubtedly a rare location where the value exceeds the price you pay.

I ordered the spicy thai wrap with the almond butter dipping sauce.  It was amazing.  It came in rice paper with romaine lettuce, carrot, red onion, jalapeño, cabbage, and cilantro. 

My boyfriend had the tuscany salad.  It was just as great.  Spinach, mix nut crumble, bell peppers, carrot, cucumber, bruschetta, and creamy italian dressing.

I'm so thankful this place is located right next to the Vegas Hot! Studio. It the perfect place after an intense hot yoga or kettlebell class. Everything is super fresh and super organic and super healthy and well, super SUPER!

There's a restaurant seating area as well as an atrium seating area. Free wi-fi. Happy employees. Their menu is small yet satisfying. They have wonderful smoothies that are made to boost energy and to re-hydrate. There are also a good selection of healthy wraps. The taco wrap and the BLT wrap aren't listed on their menu. I haven't had taco wrap yet but the BLT wrap is so yummy. Inside a hummus-like spread, tomatoes and ""bacon"" neatly wrapped in a fresh piece of lettuce. 

So why do I say ""bacon""? Becuase it's actually dehydrated eggplant that's been marinated in something salty...perhaps soy sauce? It definitely has the consistency of bacon. It's not greasy or overwhelming like bacon, though. It's delicious! My friend went to the front and asked how they made this ""bacon"". Turns out, they sell it in little 1 oz. packages! Win!

The fresh coconut water is $3. I'm not a fan of the packaged coconut water sold at stores because they taste artificial to me. But the one at Fresh Mama is sold in the actual coconut with a convenient hole for the straw. Perfect way to replenish those electrolytes after losing them in hot yoga! 

But the best item that Fresh Mama sells is their quinoa salad. Oh my goodness gracious. First bite of this, the heavens open up and the angels sing in full choir. Perfectly cooked quinoa with bits of dried cranberries and other fresh ingredients. I can seriously buy a tubful of this stuff and scarf it down like there's no tomorrow! You must try this!

The only issue I have with this place is that it's a little pricey. But this is expected with the ingredients they use in their food. They recently had a Living Social deal for this place.

Before I get into that I wanna start with the fact that its very misleading when people post reviews of this place who clearly state that they are not into ""raw/vegan"" food and then continue to bash the place for being overpriced or not ""filling"". As someone who is very into raw/vegan food I can tell you that this place is not expensive for the quality of ingredients in each smoothie and wrap as it would honestly cost the same amount if I tried to make these things myself. Plus they are innovative and create flavors and delicious dishes i would never have even thought of! In terms of healthy food I've had more expensive for less quality. In terms of how filling this place is I was certainly full off my smoothie and wrap separately but then again if you aren't used to eating this way then yes maybe you won't be full but then go hit up a McDonald's if you are clearly going to dismiss nutrition for ""full factor""

Now onto my review of their food I have has the jungle storm and red rabbit smoothie each delicious and in very large container sizes also you see them add the ingredients themselves which I always like. I've had their baja wrap with collard green outside instead of tortilla and it was the best wrap (vegan or not) that I have ever eaten! Absolutely delicious and flavorful even a little spicy. The only thing I will say is their off menu items (kale chips, desserts, etc) are a little pricey but absolutely delicious and so high of quality (organic and raw) that I cannot resist! Especially when Cheesecake Factory charges $7 a slice why not instead get a raw ""strawberry cheesecake"" slice for $6 which was amazing and very filling! I couldn't even finish it in one sitting! I've also had their kale chips which were very good the best I've has actually and they put the ingredients on the back if you are into reading labels like I am! Overall very friendly staff I was asking tons of questions about how they make things and they were very helpful and kind even gave me a free cup of smoothie!

3542024,2013-02-15,1,5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,"Got to knock Fresh Mama down 2 stars from my original 4 star review, and here is why.

I got there and only one order was ahead of me.  Took them 15 minutes to give me the Taco Salad and another 10 minutes to give me my Red Rabbit Smoothie.  Reason being is that while one lady was preparing my salad with some not-as-fresh romaine lettuce as one would expect of a $7.99 before tax salad should be, the other lady was busy chit chattin'.  That's not the worst part.

The worst part is that my favorite smoothie in the world, had coconut shells in it.  I had to be so cautious as to not accidentally bite on the shell for that may hit a nerve ending and result in a migraine (happened before with shrimp shells so I am very careful with shell-anything). There were a total of four pieces of this coconut shell that I spitted out.  When the chatter box made my smoothie, I noticed that she had dumped whatever left in the plastic container with the coconut meat in my smoothie.  Wrong move lady.

At 7.99 a wrap and 7.99 a smoothie, it felt very pricey for a counter-order wrap with no meat (obviously it is a vegan place though). A single item is not very filling, and I would suggest that the smoothie is a better value than the wrap.

They should bring back some sort of combo deal, as I think it would generate a lot more interest. While 2 items for 10 dollars was clearly a loss for them, a smoothie and wrap combo for 13 or so would really help add value to the purchase.

The tastiest thing I had there was called a Ra Reo Pie, which was an all natural raw oreo pie. The wraps and smoothies, while tasting extremely healthy, were mediocre in taste.

Anyways, the boyfriend and I were done with a class and had time to kill before another class. We decided to try Fresh Mama. Shockingly, it was the BF's 1st time there, too; despite going to VH! for almost 2 years.

I got the spicy thai wrap with ""bit-o-smoke"" dressing/sauce. It. was. amazing!

It's one of those you have to keep stirring and shaking once it's at your table.

So that's my attitude in general towards raw food and my review comes with it that attitude. That being said, Fresh Mama is seriously lacking. I've had their juices a couple times and today, a wrap. The wrap itself juiced its contents all over my hands and lap. Let me tell you, those contents weren't that good when they were a cohesive unit.

Always consider the specials or off the menu items.  Fresh and what is available makes for some creative and delicious specials.  The Kale salad and Kale chips make great take out for later at work.  Kale salad was very delicious.  I make my own kale chips and Fresh Mama makes them better.  

There is free Wifi.  It is a huge and inviting dining and hang out area.  Comfy chairs and conversation areas as well as dining tables and chairs.  I often will drop in to pass time before an appointment or errand.  It is a comfortable place to hang alone or with friends.

My visit last night was just annoying. I checked Yelp for business hours as I didn't want to drive out of my way, late in the evening just to fulfill a pregnancy craving. Closing on a Friday at 9pm. Cool. I have about 1.5 hours to get there, plenty of time. 

When we get there there are lots of people walking around the restaurant, but they looked like they were cleaning.

As soon as we opened the door an employee barked 'we're closed.... We close at 8pm on Fridays'. My husband points out the hours painted on the windows and the time listed on yelp. Again, we were barked at 'we're working on fixing that.'

There weren't *that* many people there. I ordered a  lame excuse for a wrap which was tiny and barely had any ingredients in it. I was so irritated I waited so long for crap plus it was $7.99. See pics that I posted. I thought the interior was rather cool but the service is slow and you don't get nearly your money's worth. Maybe the smoothies are better?

Looking on Yelp, I realize we weren't the only ones with a poor customer service experience. My friend and I went into Fresh Mama yesterday morning excited about the place. We live so close and figured this could be a place we would come regularly since it fits our eating habits. We were quickly let down the moment we approached the cashier. We had to greet her first. We kindly asked for a recommendation on the wraps and she listed all of them in an annoyed manner. So that was counterproductive. Lol. My friend and I both ordered a wrap. Mine came out first. It took my friend over 20 minutes to get hers because they forgot to place her wrap in the order. If she wouldn't have asked about her wrap they probably wouldn't have ever placed her order since no one ever came around to ask how we were doing. The food is pretty good. The raw vegan desserts & the baja blast wrap helped make the experience better, but we probably won't come back again because of how bad the service was. It's such a shame how uncomfortable it made the whole dining vibe.

I tried their Hawaiian tortoise and the flavor was tasteful. I couldn't taste the spinach but you could tell that that their smoothies are made with real fruits and veggies!
My co-worker had a Red Rabbit - which was fruity but there were a lot of beets in her smoothie. 

The food is filling but again pricing and not a favorite of mine. 
I had the BLT wrap - which was filling and delicious. Although the meat that they had in the wrap wasn't bacon (since they didn't have any) it was decent for a substitute. 
My co-worker ordered a spicy thai wrap - which was not the picture we had in mind for a thai wrap (although it does have a lot of kick to it!).

I agree that 7.99 is a bit pricey for a drink, but keep in mind that IT IS MADE RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES!! It's also organic produce, which tends to be higher in cost&quality!

Unfortunately, it's waaaaay across town in an area I rarely go (Rainbow/Russell), so I don't get here very often.  But when I do, I get to enjoy some good vegan raw food.  The menu consists of a variety of wraps, salads, and smoothies that are raw (or mostly raw - some of the wraps are made with rice paper or tortillas, while others use collard or romaine leaves.)

They used to do a great combo deal (smoothie and wrap or salad) for $10, but this has been discontinued... probably because it was a crazy good deal and they were barely breaking even on it!  

Thus far I have had a green smoothie made with grapes, kale and mango, which was very tasty, but not blended enough... a little chunky; a Florentine wrap - very good!!; a raw cupcake - yum!!; a spicy Thai wrap with almond butter sauce - unexpected sauce flavors, but quite addictive;  and a Caribbean salad with ginger miso dressing - I think they left the coconut chips out, boo, but the dressing was soooo good.  

The service is pretty quick, even when they are slammed, and the atmosphere is simple but clean and relaxing (it's next to/part of? a yoga studio.)

If you're looking for simple clean wholesome food, this is your spot.  ""Entrees"" run ~$7.99; they also sell fresh coconut water and Kombucha.",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,3,0,4,1jhio3dlK-BTskELCb0E4Q

The pricing is cool too since everything is $7.99 no questions asked. Really enjoyed all 3 wraps I tried. The Baja is spicy and delicious. The Verdi is super flavorful and the make your own is a cool option too. The Ginger Mustard dressing is da bomb.
 I would like to mention something about the way this place is run though. The ordering,creation,pickup process is MUCH harder than it needs to be. Make shift line always forms from the counter. There are 3 entrances and everyone kinda bobbles into one line. From this line you dont see the menu board. Also you dont realize there is a stack of laminated menus on the counter. These should be in a more conspicuous place so you can look it over before you get to the front. Next, the person taking orders has other jobs so they arent always standing at the register. This is disconcerting to some people who have questions or just want to get their order in to help the line keep moving. There should ALWAYS be someone ready to take your order. Next the order system involving tickets written between the cashier and the cook is fine but this should be simpler. Then once I have paid the cashier is like ok thanks. No direction or anything. It should be explained that your food or smoothie will come out at the other end and you either need to wait over there or come back to the counter when its done. Lastly the person speaks the drink or food that they are putting on the counter. When I was there 4 different people had a Savasana drink and they clearly got served out of order since I was at my table unaware of the process. It would be very easy to take the persons name at the time of ordering and call that out or even better have a numbering system like 98% of other counter service restaurants. 
  These are all minor distractions to an otherwise wonderful place to eat. I love the great healthy food and I wish I could feel that joyous vibe from all the employees too! As a final note you should order your wrap togo rather than for here. The togo wraps come in a paper wrap so the whole thing is stuffed fuller and much easier to eat.",OfFFtQlIoXVseWeNLm-qcg,2,0,4,9YHbH6bSOY4-sOdaj4w-_g

The hummus is what made it.   we also ordered tuscany salad with ""bacon.""   It was tasty and the bacon is actually smoked eggplant.. You would have never guessed it.

My besties and my daughter are trying to implement more healthy choices so we decide to eat here for some cool Vegan recipe inspirations.Well if you have never eaten here or at any other vegan place do not ask this staff for suggestions  they really do not give very much info.   Anyhow being Asian and used to veggies with great health advantages and tons of flavor I ordered the Spicy Thai wrap.   My friend ordered the Verdi Florentine.  And we got two smoothies  1 Was the Scarlet Scorpion and the other was made to order for my kid.  So let me start with these so called smoothies.  My kids smoothie was so bitter and tart that she could not drink it.  Parts of the white orange rinds and green strawberry leaves were floating in her drink. If you are going to frappe the whole fruit I suggest that they use better machines with higher RPMs. Bitter strawberries and under ripe oranges made for a terrible drink.  Now to our main course I was so excited thinking of how my spicy Thai wrap would be an explosion of flavor ..... WRONG they literally cut up some veggies and threw it in a rice paper wrap.  And offer some gross almond butter sauce to dip it in.  Neither part of the dish had anything to do with how Thai food tastes.  I offer  a suggestion make your raw food flavorful. You can use Celtic salt it is actually Good for you in many ways and would help your place out a ton. It wasn't so much salt I wanted on my wrap just flavor or anything that justified this being associated with the word Thai.  Make a sriracha vinagrette for your veggies or Something it can still be fresh and super healthy. You literally ripped me off with the promise of Thai flavors dancing on my tongue.  My friends wrap was Overwhelming as it was wrapped in a Collard Green. It had hummus in it which I have had super healthy hummus before no oil really good hummus and theirs was not by any means something you should call hummus.  I would never go back to this place I'm fact now I want to make my own veggie wraps and my Belville Juicer will have to make an appearance.  If you don't mind paying someone money to cut up your raw veggies and wrap them then by all means see the slow dumpy ladies at Fresh Mama. sorry but your staff was not very pleasant, fun or educational.  I believe the only reason this place is still open is because they r next to a Yoga place and nothing says healthy like plain raw vegetables. Kudos to you however I would bet the farm instead of using a nasty Almond Butter dipping sauce it would be tastier and healthier to make a vinagrette PLUS THEIR ONLINE MENU SUGGESTED CHEAPER PRICES BUT NOT THE CASE Update your info people",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,10,9,1,6akJxLMU125vhB4p9j3v_w
