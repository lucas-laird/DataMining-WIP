They recently added a variety of salsas that come out with the chips; we just went there today and they served their fresh chips with a chipotle salsa, a traditional salsa, and a black bean dip... It was great! The meals are always well presented and fresh. The happy hour is wonderful, too, with half price margaritas and they are always well mixed and delicious.

Taquito sampler was good. My kids devoured it. Burrito was amazing again.

Tex mex salad wasn't great, but everything else was.

The free chips and salsa was decent although the chips were over cooked and salsa was fresh but had no flavor/seasoning. We ordered the enchilada combination platter my friend said the ground beef was not seasoned, the rice was overly dry as well as the peas mixed in. The random pile of lettuce was fresh but clearly not understood. The refried beans- though clearly out of a can were yummy. The beef fajitas meat was not seasoned, the peppers and onions were good though. The guacamole was decent. The drinks (soda was $2.5x) were a bit much in my honest opinion. I can buy a 1 liter for $1 at most stores right now. I am glad we went with a groupon but will not be returning. If you prefer bland food that served promptly and at a nice temp this is the place for you.

2010539,2014-09-18,3,BmyRJmbVm4jGlkXg4ncLJQ,"I'm not gonna lie: my expectations for this place were low.
I saw the Groupon and read the mostly-mediocre reviews, and bought it anyway because who doesn't love a discount? Plus it's right by my work.

Well this evening I was pleasantly surprised. 
Got the Fiesta Nachos with carne asada and the lengua burrito in salsa verde with cheese- both were really good! The nachos are loaded with tons of beef and both melted and shredded cheese, and the chips are thick and crispy. Lots of guac on top, too. The burrito is served enchilada-style with the green salsa that is just right: not too much heat but a good zesty kick to it. 
Total was under $20 and portions were good- I'll be eating leftovers for lunch all week.

Not sure I'd go out of my way to go here specifically, but they have a happy  hour with discounted margaritas and dollar tacos, and the nachos at least I can highly recommend!

Down side: they don't answer their phone, so don't bother calling in an order. Minor irritation, but I ordered to go and wish I could have had it ready when I pulled up.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,4,brcr0d_GSPM-5nF-JRcDMQ

We had the trio fajitas and he shrimp was very tasty, the steak and chicken were fair.  The beans and rice were bland.  

For a place called Chips and Salsa those two things were only adequate and we can get better by buying those things at Cardenas market.  We would say the house margarita was nice and strong.

I went on a Saturday evening, and was greeted promptly upon entering. Very sweet staff. Our waiter promptly got our drink orders and even refilled our chips and salsa while we decided. They had a female live singer singing beautifully (and not too loud). 
I ordered the enchilada platter and chose chicken with red sauce. They also offer beef as an option (but no carnitas) and green sauce. The chicken was moist and perfectly cooked. The enchiladas had just the right amount of sauce and heat and cheese !!!! Oh it was absolutely delicious. The plating was beautiful and everything on my plate came out hot and fresh! 
My friend ordered the pick 3 combo and had a crunchy taco with carne asada that looked out of this world and she said it did not disappoint, it was as tasty as it looked.

3231106,2014-06-17,0,BmyRJmbVm4jGlkXg4ncLJQ,"I just want to start off by saying that I am not excited to be writing this particular review.
I was super excited to find that a new Mexican restaurant had opened RIGHT next door to my condo and even more excited to have received an awesome BOGO coupon. My fiance and I headed right over as soon as we got the opportunity and that's when the excitement was over.

First of all, with a name with ""chips & salsa"" in the title one would think that they would be wowed by the chips and salsa, but nope. The chips were average, similar to Fresh & Easy's brand and the salsa was not to our particular liking. I never expect to like everything, but a variety would be nice... none of that though. Moving right along to the entree stage... my fiance ordered the nachos and I, the steak fajitas. The nachos were sad, cold, the cheese was not melted and the chicken, flavorless. The fajitas were beautiful and the steak was tender, BUT the tortillas must have been bought at Albertson's and the rice and beans were blah. 

Overall the staff was super nice, but the food was not great and seriously lacking in flavor. I truly hope that things improve and the food gets better. I would love to have a close Mexirant that we could frequent, but for now I will keep looking.",h0Nhnq4ubn51BcbkliKE8g,2,1,2,v2ngK1JHsPwFTccCdS4DRw
3283445,2014-07-18,0,BmyRJmbVm4jGlkXg4ncLJQ,"Disappointing. Ordered a chicken taco plate, and was only able to eat part of one taco; the chicken was that bland. By bland I mean they had obviously boiled the chicken in unseasoned water for hours. It tasted like Styrofoam, and was just as dry. My boyfriend thought the burrito was bland as well. 

The reasons I give it two stars instead of one is that the chips are really good, fresh made and hot. The salsa is on the watery side, but flavorful. The nacho dish was good as well. 

They have several premium margaritas, starting at $8, which look really good as well. 

The restaurant itself has been remodeled a bit, and it's pretty cute now. Service is friendly and fast, and the food presentation is lovely. If they would devote the same time and passion to the FOOD, this would be a good restaurant. 

In short, go here for the nachos and margaritas.. That's it.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,2,2,2,pu2zv5t7Xe9v6ejvThUn8A

First, let me say I'm a seasoned veteran when it comes to tortillas chips, and salsa. I found the chips excellent in consistency AND flavor. The salsa was mild - but very flavorful. I usually like my salsa with more heat,  but this salsa was pretty good.
My sweetie ordered a soft taco trio. I ordered chicken hard shell taco / with rice & beans. Sweetie loved her asada tacos. My chicken tacos were excellent,  and filling. The rice was flavorful,  as were the refried beans.
The service was very good. The seating is spacious. The prices were a tad more than Pepe 's, and Robertos,  but the food is a cut above and worth what you pay,  in my opinion.

3746725,2014-06-23,0,BmyRJmbVm4jGlkXg4ncLJQ,"We stopped in a month or so after the remodel that was recently completed. First off, they did a great job with the interior. Nothing off the charts design wise, but everything was new looking, and clean. That always helps.  
Started off by ordering drinks. We had a regular margarita and a mango margarita. Both were tasty..nothing totally over the top. 
We ordered the guacamole to pair with the chips & salsa. The guac was really good, something that I can't say I was expecting after eating their bland chips. Personally, I think they need to kick it up a notch with their chips and salsa. They are just sub-par. We walked in expecting knock your socks off chips and salsa because they are called FIESTA CHIPS & SALSA. Their chips and salsa is equlivent to maybe...fresh grocery store quality. 
However, our entrees were great! I got the shrimp and cheese enchillada with green sauce. My boyfriend selected the carne asada. Both came with the usual rice and beans. The portions were more than enough. We definately felt satisfied after our entrees. 
Someone else had made the point that this is not ""authentic"" Mexican, and they were definately correct. The good is good, though, and you won't leave disappointed.
