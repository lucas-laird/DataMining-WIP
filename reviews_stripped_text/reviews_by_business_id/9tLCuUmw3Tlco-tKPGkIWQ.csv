64407,2012-08-02,0,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"It's incredible how much you miss a place after you move, I worked at T-mad for almost a year and I can honestly say, there is no other place like there. I ate Teriyaki Madness EVERYDAY, even on my days off I'd go in for a bite to eat.

After I moved back to Tucson, I realized there is NOTHING out here that compares to my spicy breast bowl with white rice and eggs. After spending so much time in one place it sort of becomes a second home. I was able to get a group of my friends in there and they instantly fell in love with the place. Even one of my friends who came to visit was excited to walk back in to the T-mad atmosphere. From the yakisoba noodles to the eggrolls, everything is delicious. Coming from someone who ate there everyday, take my advice. 

Every place has their flaws. No food restaurant can be perfect, but if you take the good with the bad, it eventually becomes the best.

I cant wait for the day I can go back to Vegas and get my fill of the Madness.",05wlW70Vat00bSDAPAlZUw,0,0,4,4duWk_QiH-uciKA2cXrygg
113057,2015-09-02,0,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"Yum! My new favorite place to eat in vegas. As a vegetarian, it's not easy to find quick and healthy meals. Teriyaki madness has the answer to that. I always order a tofu bowl with all veggies, no rice so I have no idea if the rice is good or not. It is always super hot and very flavorful. We have never waited more then 10 minutes for our food either. The edamame is good too, hot and salty. My hubby loves the chicken teriyaki. The prices are pretty good, not cheap but fair. Just under $20 for two entrees and two drinks. We eat here at least once a week, if not more frequently.",Sznbu2i0pTr83YweB_4BqQ,0,0,5,oDxWy69Y-XdddLGulFcLsA

I am very picky eater and with that being said I know how to order my food to my liking. I order the same thing every time I go and they get it correctly everytime. This time when I checked food they did not which is not a big deal. I simply told the cashier I asked for my rice with no veggies and instead of apologizing and fixing it she argued with me telling me I didnt not order it that way. Which is quite upsetting when I spend money at a establishment I expect to get what I want. Mean while who I am assuming was the manager was standing there listening to this whole conversation (he didnt not address who he was) came to me a told me in the future I need to order things correctly and this wont happen anymore. Basicly still telling me I am a liar and dont know how to order my own food. This location is clean and food its self was good like always, although the customer service was infurating. I will not come back to this location for that reason. I prefer not be called a liar by people who are taking my money. They clearly think they have plenty of buisness and dont need to be remotely kind to earn any repeat customers therefore I am sure they will be just fine without my buisness.",kzfopKfUmjP0HCdPcNDL1A,1,0,1,Uz9QBdLBrrxO_5C037i8BA
291467,2012-12-09,0,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"First, I'm starting to realize that I only review places that I really really love. Topping that list, Teriyaki Madness. That whole ""highly addictive food"" statement is dangerously true. 
I'm ashamed to say that I get the exact same thing every time I come, which is usually more than once a week. My husband at least switches it up. But I am totally completely satisfied with the same thing every single visit. 
Of course I'm talking about the spicy chicken bowl. Which is spicy perfection in a rice filled bowl. The chicken is always expertly cooked and grilled beautifully, extra sauce is served on the side (I always use 2 containers full), and the staff is always sweet and helpful. I go with no veggies and white rice, but you can healthy it up by adding veggies and requesting brown rice. I've never gotten a bad bowl, in fact what impresses me the most is the fact that the food is consistently fantastic. 
Just be warned... It really is addictive. If this is addiction, I don't ever want to go to rehab!",v3TgiZpazvY5moN95UqBCQ,4,0,5,oykbWt74jZFfQT_93tW7Jw

753358,2012-06-28,0,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"I'm sad to write this, because up until now, the service is pretty good and the food is pretty decent--when they get it right. Should they make a mistake, expect no apology and massive attitude problems. 

My husband and I live literally around the corner from this TM. We order food weekly. Since we order there a lot we know what the meals should taste like, and when it is obvious that someone has screwed up. Today I called in an order for 2 tofu teriyaki bowls with fried rice, one without cabbage. The woman who took the order was named Marianne. 

I picked up the order and without checking it, drove a half hour away to drop one of the bowls off to my husband for lunch. I was about 20 minutes into my drive back home when he sent me a message asking if I had remembered to order fried rice, because his was white rice. I checked my bowl and sure enough, white rice. (Bear in mind they charge more for fried rice, so this isn't a purely picky-palate issue.)

At this point I was far closer to the restaurant than I was to his job, so I drove back to TM. While I drove, I called Teriyaki Madness and spoke again with Marianne. I explained that a mistake had been made, and requested both bowls be redone with fried rice. One bowl was with my husband a half hour away, I said, but I could return the other bowl. She sounded confused, then annoyed, then asked ""Well do you want both bowls redone NOW?"". I said yes.

I came to pick up the new bowls. Only one had been redone, and Marianne and the (manager? person who runs the kitchen? she looked too unprofessional to be a manager, yet too much in charge to be only working in the kitchen) were both waiting for me. Both were scowling at me. I asked where the second bowl was. Marianne's response: ""You said you only wanted to return one."" I said ""No, I was only able to physically return one, the other one is a half hour away, but I wanted both redone--both were made wrong."" At this point the manager, whose name I sadly did not get, opened up the bowl I had brought back and asked what was wrong with it. I explained that it was white rice, not fried. She pokes around in the bowl and exclaims ""this IS fried rice!"" I said no, it's white. She points to the vegetables. ""IT'S FRIED!"" (She is literally yelling at me at this point). I said ""When I picked up the rice with my fork to look at it, it was nothing but white, and clumpy. It's not fried"" (by the time she saw it, it had been sitting almost an hour, and the teriyaki sauce had soaked into the rice, turning it brown--so I can understand her confusion-- but regardless, it certainly was not fried). She said ""Well then maybe it wasn't mixed together enough, but it IS fried!!"". Um? Fried rice is, for starters, FRIED that brown color, with bits of egg added. It shouldn't be white and clumpy! You shouldn't have to mix it up! 

Stunned and angered by the attitude and the yelling, I finally had had enough of the abuse and walked out of the restaurant. I never got an apology for their mistake, I was given nothing but attitude problem and was not offered both properly made bowls as I deserve. I knew better than to insist on them remaking them then, as I have no doubt I would have gotten spit in my food at that point.

I would like an apology from the manager for the unbelievably rude customer service and a credit issued to my debit card for both teriyaki bowls, or a gift card or equivalent for 2 teriyaki bowls (that I will use at another TM location!). Regardless of whether the staff thought the bowls were made properly, the behavior they exhibited was absolutely unacceptable. I went in politely requesting an exchange--not even a refund, just an exchange--and was treated horribly. I am happy to edit this review should appropriate action be taken. Upon scrolling through the other comments on Yelp, though, it seems I am not alone when it comes to poor customer service, and should not hold my breath.",phWl5pfQcf94Ln_znaa5Xg,2,0,1,uryvKKT9rdVIh108grIG0w

When I got home to eat it wasn't that great and it wasn't too bad. Just plain. The chicken had a nice spiciness to it but nothing to rave about. Meh.

969098,2012-07-25,0,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"T-Mad as we call it is probably one of the best fast food places in Vegas....on the healthier side of fast food.  We frequent this place and have spent lots of money here.  Thier food is alway consistent and quality with huge quantity.  I can say that I have never been disappointed.  Over the years Ive been a huge fan of Samurai Sam's and T-Mad had alot to live up to.  If given the choice Teriyaki Madness is my fav by a long shot! 

I usually get the chicken breast plate with brown rice EXTRA spicy-sometimes get the steak-chicken combo.  I dont know what they put on it to make it spicy but that sh** is the bomb.  They have teriyaki sauce at the tables and I usually drown my chicken. I get the ""plate""-its gigantic-so I can take half of it home to heat up for lunch.  Its just as good as having it fresh.  Oh yeah and the mac salad is delish-it comes with the plate!

My boyfriend gets the steak lo mein and I usually steal at least 3 bites of his.  The flavor is ridiculous.  He usually orders mac salad with it because its just that good.

The staff is always friendly and the place is always packed.  They even sent me a free entree email for my birthday which I took full advantage of.  As you can see I'm a big fan of T-MAD....you should try it! ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,5,1,5,4zIIEnZBi0p-YT1g8lM7PA

I prefer this place over Panda and the like, although TM brands itself as Asian Fusion, so it is a bit different than other places. A lot of my health conscious friends like to eat here because you can get a healthy, filling meal that's not swimming in oil. Plus the portions are big enough to have some leftover for tomorrow's lunch! 

You can choose a bowl or plate, then pick your protein. Options include chicken breast, spicy chicken, orange chicken, beef and teriyaki tofu. Then you add white or brown rice, (noodles and fried rice are other options for an additional charge) and mac salad or a house salad. They also have appetizers including edamame and cream cheese wontons, egg rolls and potstickers. They may be a bit pricier than other chains, but I think the quality is better. If you have never been, I suggest you try the spicy chicken bowl with mac salad and brown rice.

We came here all the way from Colorado visiting the town for an entire week. We just passed by and thought we would stop in. Forget us coming back here at all during our stay and j would advise others to do the same. We came in and ordered. My partner decided on his meal and then was asked if he would like a drink. We were inquiring about what drinks they had and then was told. We were deciding and Khai decided it would be best to slam his fist on the counter to signal that we need to rush our decision. NOT OKAY nor will it make us rush our decision. I stared him right in the eye just in shock at his actions. Then he asked again in a sarcastic rude time of voice. As if we didn't have more orders to give him. This is absolutely ridiculous and uncalled for no matter the circumstance. I would like a manager or the manager of this establishment to contact me right away and want my money back.,PpLfdxnu3yOYLaLOBfCqtw,0,0,1,nLeD0xzaQuww-tNbYI_F0Q

2241286,2017-01-06,1,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"One of the better and healthier fast food joints in the area! The menu is fairly simple, yet full of options. Choose your protein (teriyaki chicken, salmon, etc) and decide if you want a bowl or plate (which has about 2 oz of additional meat). Both come with your choice of rice (or low carb with veggies as a sub) and the plate also comes with an additional side (veggies or salad). 

My order is always the same when I come here: teriyaki chicken plate, low carb, with salad as my additional side. The food always comes out hot and fresh, and is surprisingly filling for under $10 per plate. I love their chicken and the fact that they don't overly drench it in teriyaki sauce! They put just the right amount of sauce on it for my taste, but there is always extra sauce on every table in case you need more!

You never have to wait very long for your food which is awesome because I'm usually already very hungry when I stop by. Definitely recommend this place to anyone that tries to eat healthy but still enjoys going out to eat!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,4,hPEQCDBihqLHoD_BBdo2Ug

It's perfectly cooked, nice and fluffy with the right amount of stickiness. Their sauce is pretty good and I like to put extra all over my chicken. The gyoza is deep fried and I would recommend blotting it with a napkin if you don't want the extra oil in your diet. I have yet to try any of the other menu items but the katsu looks delicious. As far as portion size goes, one order of the teriyaki chicken is usually lunch and dinner for me.

We go often enough that we have a standing order. We simply give them our telephone number and the order we want comes up and that is it. We do this about once a month. 

Today we walk in and I give the kid our phone number and the order total is close to $80. Our order is usually closer to $35. He double checks my phone number and then reads off the order. It is an order from like two years ago when we had friends staying with us. I'm asking how that is possible when we use that phone number to order all the time. He couldn't explain it and said he had to start from scratch. Weird. But not a big deal. 

Then I stressed to him NO SAUCE on the chicken breast bowl. I CANNOT have it. I asked him twice to make sure the order said ""no sauce"".  Got home and the order has sauce. And of course the chicken and rice is drenched so there is no way I can eat it. It will make me sick. 

Then my husband said his order was different. He said it doesn't taste like it normally does. He was surprised. As I said, we eat here, on average, about once a month. Also, the Katsu chicken for my son came with NO katsu sauce. ???? Did they omit the katsu sauce rather than the breast bowl sauce? I don't see how they could have made that mistake because I stressed that there was to be no sauce on the breast bowl.

I have been here four times since they have opened at this location and I am genuinely not impressed. Why have I been back three times since the initial visit, you wonder? GOOD COUPONS. 

I haven't cared to read what other people think regarding Teriyaki Madness' prices. But you can take it from me that this place is NOT cheap. It seems like everything is an additional dollar to add on from making the rice white to brown, the chicken from white to brown, or simply adding vegetables. When I am already paying 8 - 9 bucks for one tray of food, can you blame me for being hesitant to add anything to my already expensive meal??

I can complain about the prices all I want, but the fact is : the food itself is mediocre. The chicken katsu is often dry and the teriyaki sauce tastes like many BOTTLED teriyaki sauces (someone else said that their teriyaki tasted like Yoshida's and I CANNOT agree more!!). You can easily leave Teriyaki Madness paying 11 bucks for a single meal and still be somewhat hungry after the plate is empty. Did I mention that the macaroni salad has NO flavor whatsoever??!! I didn't think that anything with mayonnaise could be soooooo bland!

The service is just like the food : mediocre. What more can I say? Every single face that works inside Teriyaki Madness says : ""I cannot wait to get off of work"". Maybe that is normal, maybe it is a problem. You decide.

Now that my coupons are expired (or used), I've got to be honest : I have little reason to ever go to Teriyaki Madness again. There is absolutely NOTHING that would entice me to come back to Teriyaki Madness.... even if it IS down the street from my living quarters.

It says veggie but there is way more going on there including tofu. The crab rangoon was the bomb. It was delightfully overstuffed and had a nice crispy shell. The chicken was grilled to perfection. The beef and pork tasted the same and had the same taste as the beef jerkey at the fantastic swap meet. The white rice was over cooked so it tasted hard. My opinon is only eat the crab rangoon.

4052606,2013-03-22,6,9tLCuUmw3Tlco-tKPGkIWQ,"I feel that a review update is needed on this specific Teriyaki Madness. I was recently here and had good food with bad service. I waited a long time for my food and dropped my rating to a 3 because of this.  Since that review, I've been contacted multiple times from the owner of Teriyaki Madness, Dean.  We spent a good 20 minutes talking about the business, but most importantly, what T-MAD was going to do to fix some of the issues.  Let me stress that the owner never asked me to change my review, was never defensive, and never attempted to bribe me.  This is all a good sign from a owner that cares about his customers.  Dean basically explained the cooking process to me, why the katsu taste the way it taste, and why my meal took longer than most.

I actually learned some things from our conversation.  

1.  The Katsu here is made out of real chicken breast, not minced pieces of chicken.  Because they're using chicken breast, the batter that's found at Hawaiian restaurants will not stick.  So, T-MAD uses one that's healtier and can stick to chicken breast. In other words, they didn't want to sacrifice health over taste.  

2.  I usually order chicken breast with no sauce.  I had no idea that my order would take longer than everyone else because their chicken is marinated. When I order, they assume I didn't want marinade.  So, they would cook a new batch without marinade just for me.  Thus, why my meal took longer than everyone. 

3.  I commented that the other T-MAD's tasted better.  He explained some of the possible reasons with one being the new equipment at this location. 

4.  I learned that all gym-goers get a discount here.  I never seen this advertised and the employees never mentioned it.  Dean mentioned it though and I will make sure that I'm getting that discount moving forward.

Dean felt that my review was fair and deserving.  He reviewed video of my last visit, addressed the issues with his employees, and even apologized for my recent experience. Bottom line, he recognized me as a regular at most of his locations and wanted to know to know that he valued my opinion about his business. Great job Teriyaki Madness!  You just brought a fan back.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,14,10,4,sbThUR_7Oe-CssvyQkBzbg

Chicken Katsu plate+ $1 add veggies- Katsu was a little overcooked so inside was a bit dry and the crispy was that hard crisp when it sat too long in the fryer. A Veggie mix consist of cabbage, carrot, zucchinis and broccoli and seem to be fresh since none were overcooked and still have a bit of crunch. 

Chicken teriyaki plate- the chicken was juicy. I couldn't quite place why the sauce tasted familiar but it came to me later today it tasted just like Yoshida sauce that you can buy at Costco. 

Plate portions are hearty and also come with choice of mac salad which was decent or a side salad (typical iceburg mix with poppy honey mustard vinegrette) The BF and I shared and had leftovers.

Don't get me wrong, they have their share of unhealthy items on the menu, but at least you have the choice. My family and I have eaten here twice and both times we were impressed. We've tried: 

Chicken Katsu- perfectly cooked, still tender and juicy on the inside yet crispy on the outside 

Orange Chicken- delicious and so crispy when fresh 

Fried Rice- not greasy at all and the veggies aren't overcooked! 

Teriyaki Chicken- grilled to perfection 

Yakisoba- wonderfully seasoned and generously portioned. 

Spicy Chicken- Cooked to order (mild, medium or hot) grilled chicken in a spicy red sauce. 

The icing on the cake is that fact that they have outstanding customer service. Before trying the spicy chicken, I was a bit skeptical. The cashier asked for a sample from the kitchen and allowed me to try it first. She also handed my daughter a free water cup when she found it too spicy for her taste buds.

I don't know if others feel that way but I was just kind of weirded out when I walked in, but I am hungry!

I ordered up the bowl and sat down.  There was a lot of people sitting down waiting for food and than a lot of people showed up and were standing in line.  The tables and floor were not cleaned up.  They had one girl at the register and 2-3 in the back doing orders I am guessing.

I thought I would be there for awhile but it only took about 5-10 minutes for the food to come out.  I took it home and opened it up and it smelled good.  I tried the sauce and wasn't a huge fan of it.  I like the sweeter sauce better than this vinegar or whatever taste.  It wasn't horrible, just not my favorite.  Everything else in the bowl was cook perfectly, chicken, vege's and brown rice.
