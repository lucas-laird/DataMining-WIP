Ordered:
1 Hungarian Crepe-$8.42
1 Mini Original Crepe-$3.99
1 House Salad-$3.99
1 Cinammon Churro-$2.49

When I went up to the counter this kid was there and he was on his head phones which I thought was disrespectful.  I ordered my original crepe after paying for the rest of the order and he seemed irritated that I did that.  The lady that cooks the food was great.  My mini original crepe was so tasteful.  The only thing is that my dad makes crepes too so I think I enjoy the ones at home better since I don't have to pay for it and I can put my own toppings, although, I would probably come here again.",ozUSmeWq8jChBBws6GMUDw,0,0,4,tMT6LSLCEx4oAUlzStyUbg

The first sandwich I ordered consist of hard avocado and no sauce what so ever, I had to pay 75 cents extra!  I agree STAY AWAYYYYYYY",32H1vsiCtf0hyJghFnp5MQ,0,0,1,4nz6UDBcIVxSpenkeaF0EQ
