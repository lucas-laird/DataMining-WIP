He is either racist or just plain out rude. I went in and ordered lunch for my team as we usually do,  I asked him if they catered or did delivery being that they were under new management, he completely ignored me asking the question and responded to my friend/co worker who accompanied me. The restaurant then forgot to bag an order that was placed so I called in for it to be delivered. Once I opened the door after he knocked he immediately brushed past me ignoring my presence as if I invited him in. Then began speaking to someone else. Everyone in the office were taken aback by his rudeness ... Great sandwiches though, as they always were! I definitely miss the old staff/owner. He was very pleasant and greeted EVERYONE!",fVVwOlvdmSmZoS2as0cxGg,0,0,3,80pDezxY_Q5M6ueYFKeyAQ
291808,2012-04-07,0,vwo-VW7Bha4XP7evUqP4bQ,"Okay, this is actually one of my favorite lunch spots downtown.  Particularly over Quizno's.

I know it's a hit or miss for some people, but I've never had an issue with my food.  It's not the most sophisticated or upscale lunch place, but it's always consistent, which is a huge plus for me. 

I get the North Beach on Ciabatta and find that it's satisfying.  I've never waited more than 10 minutes for my food (sometimes just a couple of minutes), and the employees are nice.  (Not like the attitude I've received at Quizno's!)  I usually get my food to go, but when it's sunny and not over 100 degrees, I l like eating outside at the tables reserved for the cafe.

There's not a lot of lunch places downtown, so overall, I like this place and am happy it's an option over Quizno's.  (I don't know if it's evident, but I really do not like Quizno's.)",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,1,0,4,o1x6mzIFqP-LLXdYNi06aQ

If you want to go where everybody knows your name, this is the place to go!

My favorite order is the hot Turkey Loco (hot turkey, melted cheese, pico de gallo, and spicy mayo) on Ciabatta bread (or swirled rye when they have it), soup of the day, and a drink. 

Potato Cheddar soup is my favorite, but minestrone, broccoli cheddar, and turkey chili (I think this is the alternative soup offered everyday) are all good choices.

I eat here probably at least once a week, so it gets a little monotonous, but if you're looking for a sandwich or some soup - no complaints.  The hot sandwiches are quite tasty...I'm a big fan of the Turkey Loco and the Muffaletta.  The turkey chili, which is served daily, is also solid.  Prepackaged salads (I dig the Chef Salad) are quick and the produce has always been fresh when I have tried them.

1004246,2011-12-20,0,vwo-VW7Bha4XP7evUqP4bQ,"As many others have noted, it's not as if this place invented ""the sandwich"" but read my star rating: I'm a fan. The food is good, I haven't had a sandwich that I disliked. But it's the service that I was impressed by. Art, the owner, seems to really take interest in each customer that crosses his path. It's a breath of fresh air and something you might not see at the chain next door. 

I enjoyed my Roasted Turkey sandwich. I'm picky about cold cuts (I've basically signed an exclusive with Boars Head) and these made the grade. The bread tastes freshly baked too. The mozzarella sandwich is tasty too. Thumbs up on the turkey chili as well, can't beat it on a chilly day. If you get a drink be prepared, they're basically in vat size cups. They offer your typical 1/2 sandwich & soup lunch specials as well.

To touch again on the great service, on my last visit Art literally sat down with me and chatted it up. It was the end of the lunch hour and the place was pretty much empty. He asked about my job, how I like downtown etc etc. So friendly! Hell, I might even just come back for the conversation! You should stop in and say hi. One of the few lunch places downtown where you don't have to have a fanny pack to fit in, this cafe is worth a try.",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,1,1,4,ePfKQRA-2Mu-DUmpa8ql6A

My absolute favorite thing that I've had is their Chipotle Cheeseburger.  Deeeelish.  The sandwiches are decent - chipotle chicken ciabatta is good, as long as you get one when the bread's fresh (last time I think I cut the roof of my mouth it was so stale).  The salad's are pretty good.

The owner/manager that works the register is friendly, and if you go often, he'll make an effort to remember your name and preferences.  There aren't a lot of choices within walking distance, so this is a decent choice.  Prices range from about $4-9, which is sometimes worth it and sometimes not, depends on what you order.",VUatcI8qj9bsH_0nKHemvA,0,0,3,uiCHz24C93PoHYZnUMxA-g
1904789,2008-07-27,1,vwo-VW7Bha4XP7evUqP4bQ,"Beware: this review is WHINY.

City Centre Cafe serves the downtown lunch crowd from the state and federal buildings. They serve up sandwiches, soups, salads, and related fare. The food is fine, though the $7 sandwiches are on the smaller side. I've had a number of average meals here, but my latest made me pissy. Here's what happened:

I asked the manager/owner working the register if they used solid white tuna in the tuna melt. He said yes, so I ordered one. But I tasted the sandwich and knew immediately it was chunk light (sometimes called ""chunk white""). Anyone who eats/buys canned tuna knows there are 2 grades, solid white being higher quality and more expensive and chunk light/white being lower quality (more miscellaneous fish parts) and cheaper. I brought the sandwich up to the guy and told him I was sure it was chunk light/white, and he said it was and asked if I wanted something instead. 

So the dude straight lied to me and thought I wouldn't be able to taste the difference??? I really don't care if City Centre Cafe wants to save a few bucks by using lower-grade tuna, but don't lie about it to your customers!!!! Like I said, maybe that's a whiny complaint -- it's canned tuna after all -- but the whole thing just pissed me off.

If my hands were big enough, I would karate chop this place. HYAH!",tEcUrOeTabyFkUxdGECAkQ,2,2,2,jtDmuWW0R9V7HO427gaL9A

A big thing with me is customer service - not once have I not been greeted by Art or any of the others that work there everyone is always in a good mood, they are courteous and the food is always good and its consistently great!  I usually eat there 3-5 times a week and not once have I got bad service or a bad sandwich.  

The service is very fast - I have never waited longer then 10 minutes and I have never got the wrong order in my bag and I don't know why but I love the brown bag sack lunch, guess it reminds me of mom packing my lunch as a kid or something like that, who knows.  Art always speaks and we chat it up from the time I walk in until my food is ready if he isn't helping other customers.  The vibe is always relaxed and friendly to me - if I had to mark them down for anything it is that they set the standards ""bar"" to high for me to go try other places to eat downtown for lunch.  I rarely go anywhere else and after my Rueben fiasco at Luca's I doubt I'll be looking for any other sandwich shop downtown again!",LmUR9Us0cGmYEopISVx5CQ,0,0,5,Dzg5-wGM7WUxBjyYpa-J4w

They understand that their lunch crowd most likely has time limits, and not only do they take orders quickly but they serve you quickly too. This doesn't compromise the quality of food, it's good!

The location of this cafe is awesome!  I'm such a big fan of places in the heart of a city.  I love taking trips to metropolitan cities and discovering food joints along the way.  This cafe is located on 4th and Lewis on the bottom of City Centre.  Awesome!

The place isn't that large.  A counter area, a few tables to eat on and that's it.  Kind of reminds me of a subway without the strong smell of bread.  This place is simple and to the point which I appreciate!

On the menu, you have breakfast, salads and soups, cold and hot sandwiches.  Whenever I check out  a  new sandwich joint, I ALWAYS get the same sandwich:  Pastrami!  I'm a big fan of that sandwich and I feel I have a good sense of a good pastrami sandwich versus a great pastrami sandwich.  On this visit, I got the Hot Pastrami sandwich for only $6.95.  I was super stoked, because the price is affordable for a downtown location!  This sandwich is filled with ground mustard, mayo, tomato and Swiss cheese.  They have a list of breads to choose from and chose the swirled rye.  Great choice!  Their food is made to order and this sandwich was on point!  The swirled rye was dense but light, not dry.  The pastrami was well seasoned.  I loved the mayo and mustard combination and the other toppings definitely enhanced the flavor.  Super delicious sandwich.  

The owner of the shop was there and once finding out where I worked, he kept trying to give me so much free stuff:  Chips, drinks, cookies, etc.  I didn't end up taking anything out of fairness, but I appreciated the nice gesture.  I would like to visit this place more to try other things.  I don't think I quite got the entire experience because of the short time we had.  I think it could be a 5 star joint in my books, so I will return to double check their potential.
