My husband and I shared a house special salad with baby spring mix, pecans and a special dressing.  Then we both had the prime rib and it was cooked to perfection.  I was worried when I saw the size of the asparagus, as they were really thick and I always try to get the thin tender ones.  I should not have worried because they were tender and cooked so they were still crisp.     
We did not have reservations but we were there mid week.  Our server was very serious but the other staff were friendly and engaging.   The only down side was a very intoxicated diner, but the entire place was quiet and cozy once he left.",3e4IRxPe-5Vni67bgmwt0A,2,1,4,F8sFcAqJ9HhRDBLL_eGcaw

Although they aren't there in person, they definitely are in spirit. You'll hear their voices fill the air, as you sit and enjoy a wonderful meal. 

I love this steakhouse so much I frequent it every time I visit Vegas. ( which is on average about 1-2 per month) 

Allow me to start by expressing my gratitude to their amazing staff. Dominic Perisi their manager has always taken time out of his busy schedule to personally assist me in finding the perfect Pinot Noir. My waiter Ray has always given my friends and I nothing but top notch service. Keeping our wine glasses full and smiles on our faces with his personable charm. 

The menu has everything you want in a great steakhouse. Fresh seafood, premium steaks, mouthwatering side dishes, and desert creations you won't find anywhere else on the strip. My personal favorite is their take on s'mores. 

So, next time you are visiting fabulous Las Vegas, do yourself and your taste buds a favor and visit TJ's! You won't be disappointed.",CJFMI5zRdT2U3wvutdKrCA,3,2,5,A-kAwOfKfoMw5P_JyY3tyA
601654,2013-10-04,0,wdsGP5rJinx0J5GcGzPQUw,"TJ's is like stepping back in time to the golden age of Las Vegas. Staffed by a league of gruff older gentlemen, the service is impeccable and very attentive, if a little like a good fellas' hang out! On the recommendation of my server I tried an enormous rib eye, accompanied by sides of potatoes au gratin, herbed mushroom medley and grilled asparagus with lemon aoli. The steak was perfectly mid-rare, with the fat all crispy & delicious around the edge. The sides are still styled the way they probably were when they opened, with the mushrooms a little chewy and less herbed than I would like, and the asparagus a little charred on a spear or two (but otherwise crisp and really good). The potatoes didn't look particularly spectacular but tasted pretty good all the same.
To finish off this gargantuan meal, I chose a creme brûlée and the TJs' coffee. The creme brûlée sugar crust was toasted to golden perfection and the coffee laced with generous amounts of brandy, Kahlua and whipped cream. I would have liked to have my dessert and coffee brought after I had finished the glass of Penfold's Shiraz/Cab, and again, waiting until I had finished my dessert before the bill was brought so I could feel like sipping my coffee and digesting my meal was welcome.

1209598,2011-01-27,0,wdsGP5rJinx0J5GcGzPQUw,"Was in Vegas for a trade show recently & was invited to a customer dinner at TJ's in the Hilton. I have to say that I was really looking forward to a great Sin City dinner at one of the hot spots on the strip & TJ's is not it... However, I knew that going into it and the bottom line for us was that it was convenient to the trade show, taking place a few steps away at the LV Hilton Convention Center. 

We were greeted by our server with menus in hand right as we were seated - he was a character! I believe his name is Limon and very accommodating :-) We started our meal with a lovely champagne cocktail and a bread basket with an assortment of different breads and softened butter was passed around. 

Next, the wine ""expert"" at our table selected a lovely bottle of Pinot Noir for us all to share... delish! We finally made our menu selections and were served our soup/salad starters in just a few moments. My selection was the lobster bisque which I was quite pleased with, although it could have been a bit hotter - temperature wise. It did have some nice chunks of lobster meat in it and the texture was a buttery velvety perfection. The salads served to a few of our dining partners looked nice, again - great portions - although I didn't taste any of them.

Next up - the entrees and naturally, most of us ordered up a steak and/or lobster. My fillet was cooked to perfection with a *fabulous* Maitre 'd butter. Now, they're on the pricey side - I want to say aprox. $39/steak with no sides included. We ordered up a nice assortment of side dishes (about $9/side) for us all to share, including the mac 'n cheese, whipped potatoes, asparagus and broccolini... All = YUM! 

After that grand meal none of us were up for dessert, although a few of us enjoyed a hot tea or coffee. 

I have to say that the only negatives were the atmosphere, it feels like a hotel restaurant & not in the show-stopping Vegas way and the fact that it's located in the out-of -date Hilton. I'm pleased to share that our trade show is being upgraded to a hotel & convention center on the strip next year - yea! Although this is not TJ's fault :-)

Bottom line - if you're stuck at the Hilton, TJ's is a nice place for a great steak dinner!",z1kGXTQodh-XRb-hA7mQCQ,4,2,4,SHXhTnUVaQfObOb-WYoPFQ

I can't eat the bread, but our table devoured it and asked for more... it was some kind of honey wheat loaf with fruit and damn did it look/smell good!

This steak house is a little known jewel.  Delicious apps, one of the best wedge salads I've ever had, perfectly cooked steak, and usually, the service you would expect from a high end steak house.

This place is old school; dimly lit, dark paneled walls and red leather booths.

I took my family here to expose them to TJ's, as I've been telling them about it for forever, and it didn't disappoint.  We shared a shrimp cocktail, which had four very large, fresh shrimp with a great cocktail sauce. 3 of us had the petite fillet, which was deliciously tender and cooked perfectly.

Their entrée doesn't come with sides. So that sucks.

we ate here our first night in vegas on a work trip (i.e., company card), as we were tired and it was really the only decent looking sit down restaurant in all of the HIlton. for a place that has $50-$80 entrees, we waited an awful long time to be seated. we stood at the host stand listening to phone ring off the hook and watched the servers look at us as they went about their work (not so much as a ""someone will be with you soon"") for about 10 minutes. finally the host appeared - an older gentleman who did apologize and seemed like he indeed had been attending to an important task.
he sat us in the standard, low lit fancy steakhouse setting (cloth tableclothes, pre-set stemware) and we looked over a wine list. our server was predictably sassy/snooty but did recommend an excellent glass of zinfandel.
i ordered a medium well filet mignon (one of the, if not the, cheapest items on the menu at $29). in typical expensive dining style, that came with nothing, so we ordered garlic mashed potatoes and truffle mac and cheese on the side (at 8 bucks a pop).
bread and butter arrived - a focaccia chunk and a fig-infused loaf. the focacia was excellent. and when our food got there it was pretty damn good. the mashed potatoes were nothing special but that mac and cheese...i could not stop eating it. a fourth of my steak was leftover because i just kept eating that damn pasta. service was attentive throughout the meal, with incessant water filling.
i don't think i'd go back. the food wasn't bad, and i wasn't that bummed by the snooty service, i just would rather spend that kind of money on more a unique expereience  i guess. but that's my style, and i'm sure this place is perfect for the traveling businessmen and vacationing suburban 40-somethings who are looking for a nice steak.",HhVNG_1NOEyxfxudd6TSCg,2,1,3,tRBjHvAlIiiBmXPmQXlVDQ

My bone in ribeye tasted a tad funny on the edges.  It tasted like...the fridge =X  It was gross.  They give you a HUGE steak though, more than enough to share with another person.  Problem is...who gets the end pieces? XD

My bf got the prime rib and thought it was okay.  Nothing special.  I tried it, I agree.  Haha, he'd rather go to Outback XD

My friend's mac & cheese was very good =d  And the broccolini was also very good.  The complimentary bread was okay, except for the bitter fig pieces...weird o.o;;

We had the strawberry tree dessert.  Apparently my friends had gotten that earlier in the year and the strawberries were HUGE =d  Wasn't so for the autumn =T  They could, at the very least, have given us more strawberries to compensate *SIGHS*  And the white chocolate and ""dark"" (more like milk) chocolate dips were much too sweet and lumpy...???

My companion ordered hers well done and it came butterflied and a little dried out and overseasoned. The table shared a potato au gratin and mesquite grilled asparagus.  Both were solid and good, if uninventive, and generously portioned to share and decently priced at $8.95 per side.

The wine list was not very extensive, but they had a decent selection of under $60 bottles as well as under $15 by the glass.  The service was also decent, if a bit aloof and pedestrian.

Number one pet peeve: Any steakhouse that doesn't include salad and potato with the entrée will never get five stars from me. Seriously. $40 for a steak and you can't throw in a little lettuce and the world's cheapest vegetable? If they upped the price to $50 and included the sides, I would feel much less ripped off, even if that is not the reality. Perception is truth.

In their defense, their salads were really nice. Well dressed, interesting combinations and portions large enough to share. At about 10 bucks a pop, they'd better be.
And the lobster bisque was wonderful: very hot, creamy, and delicious, with noticeable chunks of lobster and the best croutons I've ever eaten floating on the top. I would have paid the freight for a side of those without a squawk.

The bread was also wonderful, very fresh and with a great chewy crumb. (Or did I just like it because it was free?)

Entrees are the usual suspects: steak, chicken, fish. Babygirl got the salmon, which was a large portion, cooked perfectly (moist but done through). The filet was fine, but UH-OH, my sister and I both ordered the rib eye, and it was extremely disappointing. I asked for rare, and explained that I meant warm red, not cold blue. No problem. I got dry brown. Figured they mixed up our orders, so she and I switched. That one was better, but still overdone. She sent the offender back, and they brought out another that was cooked less, but still hard and chewy. Reminded me of the time my old boyfriend complained to a waitress who asked about his steak that ""It was a shame they had to cut up a tire with that much tread left on it"". Amen.

Sides were a mixed bag. We really liked the asparagus and the cheesy, bacony au gratin potatoes. The macaroni and cheese was dry and kind of flavorless. Guess it was made by the same guy in charge of the rib eyes.

And my baked potato was huge, hot ,fluffy and wonderful. It would have been hard to finish it all if I hadn't kept reminding myself that the sonofabitch cost ten bucks. And I wasn't exactly stuffed full of steak.

It was my sister's birthday (at least that's what we told them), so they brought out a complimentary (Hooray!) dessert- a really pretty baked Alaska that they cut up and served to us all.

Service was fine and the ambience was pleasant enough. It would have been quite comfortable if they hadn't found it necessary to jam everyone in a not-crowded restaurant  into one small area. I thought maybe they were trying to make it easy on the wait staff, but they were squeezing between tables and brushing into customers, so I doubt they liked the arrangement either.

In conclusion, I would probably go here again, but not order steak. Not a very glowing recommendation for a steakhouse.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,2,3,0kTUHIGHJ3wLv948J1q0ew

Before you go here, you need to figure out a reason to justify it. Pretty much every hotel in Las Vegas has a steakhouse, and I would say that most of the ones I have been to are better. But maybe you're going here because you think the casino host will comp your meal. Legit reason. Or maybe you're me... and your girlfriend got sucked into a timeshare presentation... and part of our ""package"" included a $100 gift card to the steakhouse. Thus, we had a reason to go.

Our service was just fine, and our waiter was quite friendly. As for the food itself, it was also fine. And when I say ""fine,"" I guess I really mean that it was quite good. However, in the realm of expensive steakhouses, it was probably just fine. The bread was warm, and I definitely had my fair share. We got an awesome appetizer of seared ahi tuna. That was definitely the highlight of the meal.

I went with a steak and lobster. The lobster was excellent, and the steak was about average, for a nice classy steakhouse.

We had a very nice meal here, and we would not hesitate to go back, as long as we had some reason to do so. If it were our choice, we'd pick one of the other steakhouses on the strip, which are maybe only slightly more expensive and far more unique.",LkyT0hPUs_47mCtS4MQs3Q,1,0,3,5Zug3ok7ZayW_-MEuRg6WQ

I had the classic steakhouse meal: some mildly-genteel Cabernet, Caesar salad, petite Filet and baked potato. The baked potato is GINORMOUS, so I shared with my date -- and it was plentyfor each of us (and I have what's politely called a ""healthy"" appetite).

Everything was great. The Caesar wasn't fishy, the steak was fabulous, and the potato was...a potato (pretty hard to f*ck THAT up!). Prices were as expected: my date ordered the exact same thing as I did, but with a second glass of wine, and the total bill was around $170.  

Since steak is steak, let's talk atmo: is there anything that sets this apart from every other steakhouse in Vegas? Well, it's SOLIDLY unpretentious, which earns it big points in my book....but the ambiance is kinda dull. Dim lighting, boring furniture, and not much in the way of decor aside from giant black-and-white photos of past stars who have performed at the hotel. The one over our table was of Miss Ann-Margret...but was mislabeled as ""Charo"" (!!!!!!). 

Overall: if you're staying at the LVH, this place is fine. But I wouldn't call it a destination steakhouse.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,8,8,3,jD-MCeC5LF-38Fo9KTEPEw
