Der Laden ist sehr klein. In Deutschland würde man so etwas wohl als Luxus-Imbiss mit Tagsüber-Geschäft bezeichnen. Innen gibt es nur sehr wenig Sitzplätze, außen gibt es etwas mehr Sitzgelegenheiten, aber auch reichlich bettelnde Tauben. ;-)
Wir hatten uns Sandwiches bestellt. Diese wurden frisch zubereitet und waren großzügig belegt. Geschmacklich waren die Sandwiches okay. Wir hatten außerdem noch eine Portion Fritten dazu bestellt. Diese sind aber eher nicht empfehlen (etwas matschig).
Der dazu bestellte Kaffee (einmal normal, einmal Latte) war sehr zu empfehlen. 
Die Tische waren nur semi-sauber - eine regelmäßige Reinigung der freien Tische haben wir nicht miterlebt.
Das Publikum besteht hauptsächlich aus Bürokräften, die in der Nachbarschaft arbeiten.

Das Espression Cafe ist sehr nah an der Fremont Street. Man geht praktisch auf Höhe des Binions zum Golden Nugget und dann noch etwas weiter geradeaus. 
Wichtig: Der Laden hat nur tagsüber geöffnet.

Tipp: Man bekommt immer sehr günstig Gutscheine über restaurant.com.",nhASzYdqRwYiUgASyMVKUw,1,0,3,Qfidn6LecY0zO6tCKJ98PQ

I also got a blueberry muffin and a hot chai tea to drink. Everything was delicious! Hubby got a hamburger with fries and a soda. Hamburger meat needed salt and didn't have much flavor. 
The cafe had a restroom and enough room for about 25 people. There were 2 tables for 4 people and the other tables were for two people. There were condiments on the side which provided packets of ketchup, mayo, napkins, plastic forks, spoons and knives. It's a cute place. 
If you check in, you get a free gelato if you purchase the lunch special. We had breakfast so I saved my check in offer for later.

Menu includes coffees, sandwiches, soups, salads, desserts, and a few other things. BF and I split a buffalo chicken Panini and a pasta e fagioli soup- the soup I did not care for at all, but BF said it wasn't that bad once he added salt and pepper. 
That Panini though was awesome: huge portion size, plentiful chicken and bleu cheese, not too spicy, but filling and really hit the spot.

I think it all depends on who's probably cooking or whatever the case may be.  Some days, the food I get is amazing and then some days, its like WTH!  Like today, there are days where I get their turkey burger which works for me but I decide to have sweet potato fries, cooked well to go with my order.  I know I asked for well done on my fries, but I didn't ask for the burnt look.  It was still edible but the girl in my office thought I was having BBQ for lunch.  

I've tried their Flatbreads and I was going to attempt to try all of them.  The first one I tried was the Smoked Salmon (smoked salmon, spinach, cream cheese, and chives), instantly I thought it was too salty.  The 2nd one I tried was the Charcutiere (pepperoni, ham,  turkey, mozzarella, fig spread and mix greens), I thought that was EH...didn't care to much for the fig spread.  Then last, I tried the Chicken Pico (grilled chicken, cheddar cheese, mix greens, and fresh pico de gallo salsa), and it was JUST RIGHT. It instantly became my favorite.  It had a little bit of protein, carbs, some veggies...the perfect little combination.  I liked it more so because it had the mix greens in it.  I ordered this a few more times and recently when I ordered it, it didn't have my mix greens which I was looking forward too.  That really put a damper on wanting to order it again.  Just makes me feel that if I order it again, I'd have to be sure they didn't forget the mix greens.

I always get their green tea smoothie.  I really think this place should make smoothies/drinks that uses fresh veggies and fruits as well.  Just saying.

And by really good, I mean fresh, quality ingredients, carefully prepared and presented dishes that won't be charged at tourist prices. 

Espression Cafe is now one of my favorites. Although I can walk to it (I LOVE that I don't have to drive there), they also deliver, which is great for those insanely busy work days. They've got a pretty big breakfast and lunch menu, though admittedly I eat breakfast all day so I know more about that than anything else. I've eaten from there enough to know now that everything they make is fresh, delicious, and prepared well--even down to their pastries and coffees. 

I try not to eat out too much but Espression is definitely my guilty pleasure that I'd probably splurge on at least once a week if possible.",WdVXWrJFcQKdk3LF_R9Mdg,0,0,5,O2qr64DqTXVqWSILmp4jYg

I have to deduct a star and a half simply because the service has really fallen back in the last couple years.  Used to love it here, but now you get a sourpuss in the mornings when you order a coffee or whatever.  And despite the fact that they got positive feedback from me on one of their soups, they never carry enough of it, so it was always out of stock! That seemed insensitive to what customers want. Worse, once I ordered a pie that was absolutely bone-chilling cold in the middle. When I called to complain, I was told it was my fault, as I should have known that it needed to be ""reheated."" But I work at the courthouse across the street, and not in a section where I can get to a microwave or an oven.  I ordered a dessert that I could eat right then and there...not take home and fuss with.  I didn't mind that I may have made a poor choice. But I do mind being blamed for it, as a regular customer.

3726437,2016-01-29,0,5iHctUjkQTGwEvOaBkwMRQ,"Great little cafe. Wide selection of food cooked to order or ready to take and go! 

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and my co-worker had the pulled-pork panini and fries. Both were very flavorful, cooked perfectly, and huge portions! The burger is a double patty with thick cut applewood smoked bacon, served without condiments but easily available. The panini was cooked just right, and the Jack Daniels pulled pork was divine, with large pieces, not too fatty, and just the right amount of sauce! The fries were large and perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside with soft center. 

Prices are quite reasonable for downtown, especially considering the portion size. We parked in a meter spot on the next block over, but there is also a paid parking garage in the same building. Plus 15 minute pickup zones right in front of the cafe, easy to pop in for Italian coffee or a to-go order! And delivery available to my office!

The only complaint I have is that the door was open and A/C blowing strong in January. It was cold inside, but they explained the A/C was for air flow not necessarily temperature. I'm sure this would feel lovely in better weather, but it was too cool to be comfortable today.

All in all, we will definitely be back! Even my picky-eater co-worker said there were many items on the menu she wanted to try! I'm looking forward to better weather when we can sit outside on the cafe patio, since it is shaded by the building across the street.",2rELhEiVfqaYa-CpdNSU9A,1,0,4,XUNrVPBTYhTs3X81RJEmnw

The food was pretty good but the wait was about 10 mins for both of us to receive our food which was a bit long. Typically, I would probably rate about a 3 stars because I really did enjoy the setting and the food BUT the reason why I rate 1 star is because while I was walking toward the restrooms one of the gentlemen who worked there must have been on break and was sitting at a table and pointed me in the right direction to the restrooms (which I really appreciated) but then as I walked away he said, ""Damn you fine as hell"". I didn't realize he was an employee there until I sat back down and seen him behind the counter. He was an older gentlemen wearing a blue hat.

2) Lots of healthy options and fresh ingredients. 
3) They have a pretty quick turnover for the dine in lunch goers (always a place to sit). 

This is an extremely convenient place to grab a healthy and economically friendly lunch if you work nearby or in the area. The workers are always friendly and the food is always good.

4848203,2015-04-15,0,5iHctUjkQTGwEvOaBkwMRQ,"""Omelet"" - It's the word that I searched on Yelp that led me to the discovery of this wonderful restaurant (or is it a café?) Until recently, I have been frustrated of not be able to find a place within walking distance where I can find some good food for lunch or breakfast. Voila, a simple ""omelet"" search led me to a restaurant where the food is fresh, delicious, and very reasonably priced.

To be honest, I haven't tried all the food at the Espression Café, but whatever food I have tried, they all tasted so fresh and delicious. I love their Garden Omelet and have eaten their omelet more this past 3 months than I have ever eaten in the past 10 years. Their chicken pesto Panini and flatbread are yummy and pretty large. They always cooked the eggs perfectly just the way I requested (over medium.) All the ingredients they used seem and taste very fresh. 

Beside the food, their customer service is awesome. Every time I came to pick up my food, I was always greeted with a smiles and that made the whole experience so much better. Even though all the girls working there are so wonderful, I have to give extra cred to Marissa for the banana milkshake recommendation and Silviya who always answered the phone when I called to place order.

If the two reasons I listed above haven't persuaded you to give it a try, you should look at their menu pricing. For what they offer,  you would have to pay twice as much at other restaurants and might not even get the same quality. 

As for me, I will definitely continue to explore other items on the menu and recommend this place to my co-workers and friends.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,5,444spKI0vtlEHWy0YIXU_w

My vegetable egg white omelette was absolutely delicious and huge. My husband had the Buffalo chicken Panini with fries and he said it was awesome. It was a little bit awkward that his sandwich came out 20 minutes before my eggs. So he was done eating before I started. The only condiment available for the eggs was Tabasco sauce or a very bland salsa. I would've much preferred to have hot sauce of some kind of authentic salsa for my eggs. The drinks in the cooler aren't marked with prices so I wasn't sure what anything cost. I ordered a bottle of water and then was told that the brand of water I picked was three dollars more than the one I paid for. Their menu is very impressive however and they have an attractive hot food buffet so you can literally get almost anything that you would want to eat there from muffins to coffee drinks to smoothies to hot dishes to sandwiches and soups.,yjknooCG7j5DxI2_YUbYUA,0,0,4,NiWzHb3GE0olh2zkVCmCig
