744052,2015-07-04,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,I'm pretty much done with this Papa John's. The only thing consistent in their service is the hour long delivery times and sending the wrong pizza with my order. I have enough Papa Points for a free pizza but I won't even use it because of this location.,b4aIMeXOx4cn3bjtdIOo6Q,2,0,1,mcX0nKnwpidBhhJxuzonhw
1453041,2017-11-03,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,Placing a delivery order over the phone with the employee at this location was like pulling teeth. There was no prompting on their behalf when it came to asking about payment information. It was too difficult for them to take down simple information. Im absolutely astounded they can even run anything.,zW9M7MqQzfP99DjKa31kxQ,0,0,1,j1mjhFUemxhM9gU6l-ccGA
1716737,2016-07-24,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,Took over 1 hour and 20 minutes to deliver.  From online order.  Confirmation said 40-50 minutes...  call they just gave excuses.  No compensation....  driver still took 15 minutes to arrive... more excuses at the door even when i did not say anything to him.   Pizza was cold....  very frustrating for 300 pm on a sunday afternoon.   Very poor customer service,q5Diu06hr29AvFExLE-YZQ,0,0,1,_VBI6U4MkcTTgclMR_aj0g
1906447,2017-07-15,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,I have been going here for almost a year and the past two deliveries have not gone well. Last week the driver couldn't find my condo. When you first pull in there's a map right there or he could've called. Delivery was over an hour and I live 2 miles away. Tonight though was bad. 45 min wait wasn't too bad but when the driver showed up she didn't have my garlic knots in the order. She said she would go look in her car. 10 minutes later I go out and check and she's gone. So I call and dude answers and tells me that she called it in and he would be bringing them out in 20-30 minutes. Absurd!!! When my garlic knots finally arrive they're cold and a complete mess. I think it might be time to go back to dominoes,E_LUX_kQTN_0aVYsdfP0cQ,0,0,1,5R8cbicAPrWR1V6GpZ4dYw

Once they answered it was a whole different person and kept giving attitude while I was asking info. Went in personally to view deals and the girl was giving attitude again. Another guy ""I'm assuming the manager"" came to help and was also very rude. When paying, I gave him my card and he snatched it and threw it to the counter after while I had my hand sticking out to grab it. never again will I come back to this place. Oh and to mention, once the girl got done helping us she went back to making pizzas without washing her hands.",HbuREPU2qr9Mzhr9sLogEw,0,0,1,JVLxVZk9KJWtYicMSVC3Yg

3919820,2016-08-03,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,"this place is terrible. Their food is decent but their service is the absolute worst. I always order a large pizza, extra garlic sauce, and garlic parmesan cheese breadsticks. I recently purchased a high school discount card from a football player.  It gives a papa johns code for pick up and also carryout.  I called to try and use it.  The girl on the phone...I believe her name to be Laurna  or something to that extent was extremely rude.  She completely dismissed it.  I told her I was holding it in my hand and she said I'd have to come in to use it.. ok I'm down the street... oh...but we're closed right now... I can order over the phone and have it delivered... but they wouldn't accept my coupon...because they were closed... uh ok... so after she hung up on me and then hung up on my brother in law.. we ordered pizza hut.  So tonight we decide we're going to try this valid coupon again...it doesn't expire until JUNE 2017... they were rude on the phone yet again and wouldn't let us over... I'm over this place.  never will eat at this location again.",ZoS896pPw9YuVKo4mD0RGQ,0,0,1,xxbf2o_beUwSkh3WY5RdMQ
4272972,2015-09-13,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,"Beginning of football season. Asked wife to order pizza online. 10 minutes later I wondered why my wife had not sent me to pickup the pies. Went into the room and she was nearly in tears. I guess she had ordered online and the website went whacky. She called the location to make sure that the order had actually been submitted. The customer service guy was giving her such grief, like she was trying to steal something.
He was talking to the General Manager the same time that he was talking to my wife. This conversation went back and forth for 5 or 6 minutes with my wife at one point telling the guy,. ""I'm sorry bout your website but it sounds like you don't want to take my order.""
I went to pickup the order and spoke to the General Manager. I showed him physically the pic of the website where we had ordered the pizza. 
He acted like nothing had transpired and noticing that I was getting pretty agitated, ask me what he could do to make it right. I told him that first he should have the crew member call my wife and apologize. (this still has not happened)  and secondly, straighten the crew member out about customer service.
Once again. I've purchased pizza from here on numerous occasions. Sadly, I will never purchase from here again. All I wanted was a stupid pizza and now I have to watch my wife be upset for the rest of the night.",j4C9zl6dCDKl4RKFfVYGEw,3,0,2,J8MJX3cRbNqid1LPsrz-Bg
4604779,2017-09-25,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,"Surprised at the low ratings on this particular Papa John's. Everytime I pass by, it looks really clean and well run. Anyways, this review is for the delivery experience.

We ordered 2 Large Meat lovers pizzas, and on half we added black olives, on the other half diced tomatoes. 

The guy who took our order was fine. He said it would be 30 min. It came fast, and fresh. Usually I don't like Meat lovers that much, but this one was really really good. The dough was exceptionally good. Super fresh! I will definitely order again.",pUyU6DsygUY51l5k1R1jLA,1,1,4,pnZV3Inm2ZqOcKD1Y_tYqQ

5596734,2017-07-08,0,mvWhlMnXXidb1R2krK25VQ,I don't know what all the bad press is about this papa johns.  We have been ordering there every weekend and the pizza is always fresh and the staff is always kind and friendly.  As I expect that from a restaurant I never felt the need to actually review them.  I can't help it my standards are high :).  This past weekend was my first less than stellar experience.  I called when I was shorted a couple of wings and not only did they refund me but they offered to remake it on my next visit.   Now that is what I call going above and beyond.   To the manager William I thank you for providing excellent customer service and appreciate you and the staff.   Also if you haven't try the Honey Chipotle wings.   They are OUTSTANDING!,crOnL6IXzIRxzOO5j8kRSQ,0,1,5,8mAHS_xb1PrY-pk4DrVYXQ

They asked me to wait outside for them.. at that point I cancelled the order. Waiting an hour and half, I wasn't about to have cold pizza too 

Do yourself a favor and order from a location that provides good service.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,0,0,1,baDc6rgOJx6AbJlVj5Uu1Q
