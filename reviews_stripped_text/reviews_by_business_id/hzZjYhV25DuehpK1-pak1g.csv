Lily was always checking if we are in need of anything. Food was amazing. Fruits were fresh, salads were good and the meat tender and tasty. Had a great dinner with the hubby.",XKJMFL5la767RHwZLyyBbA,1,0,5,dvbukCombuCdZa5MgihvYw

We received a voucher for dinner after seeing a show so we had a set menu from which to choose. I had the steak which came with mashed potatoes, green beans, and one trip to the salad bar.",FRMzbAFV5FzmWlK54WOgcA,0,0,4,daGEovT6hh-nAAIJ2bNt2A

On this occasion I ordered the surf n turf rodizio and after the first plate discovered I decided I would prefer the muscles not in the sauce it came in. I asked our waitress who asked her manager if it was possible to get the muscles out of the sauce and she came back from the kitchen she had ordered me a plate of muscles cooked in white wine instead of the tomato sauce. I was very impressed with her going above and beyond in doing that. Thank you Pampas always delicious!",HubhC54z9TfQcucB7dmBhA,2,1,4,VP8acQUmZGx7C_H0UGjLuw
