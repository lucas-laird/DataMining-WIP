No only  was the food beyond words, the service and company of Cheryl C. Was the best  we've  ever experienced  in our lives!  We will easily make the 4 hour drive from LA to come here any time!",nk-Pf_S4OLaUWksNxWSpTQ,1,0,5,iYrMcwxGF-97yVqHIn0sgQ

We went to this place based on a huge billboard ad displaying all-you-can-eat spaghetti for $5.99. The picture looked scrumptious!

We were exhausted from hiking at the RedRock Conservatory park and just wanted a quick meal. We couldn't understand the waitress. She had such heavy accent! When inquired about the spaghetti special, she directed us to downstairs to get a 'plus card.' We understood this part of what she was saying... We skipped getting the card.

My chicken wings were sooo salty! ...and I like salty food! My husband's spaghetti tasted so bad that he only had one plateful, and he was hungry! Our young son didn't even like fried chicken, and he likes fried anything! 

This spoke volume about their quality (or the lack of) of food. The bill still turned out to be appx $37! 

Not worth a visit!",TbdUv1a9gLsBNqDrP-MvXA,0,0,1,PSjUcF1dEbmHJzgSVx5Wbg
2154482,2015-05-04,0,MvLpD44gr5OwDFYY59winQ,"i was pretty impressed with the food quality here, it was very quick and tasted great. had a filet and lobster tail, Cesar salad in a  Parmesan cheese bowl that was edible and great tasting and a chocolate truffle desert and i have to say it was excellent considering it was not at a high end casino with a bill totaling over 100$. i paid just over 70 dollars for myself including the tip. The only reason there is not a 5 star is because of the casino location, it is kind of frustrating to get to with all the traffic on paradise or flamingo around 530pm. Great pick though, i strongly recommend trying it out.",swK-2Z3cY8mQIWXTSgTLbw,0,0,4,bE88I5CzsSxLbCTqPik0eA

This time I had the same thing,,,,my table mates had the Wor Wonton Soup, Meatloaf and I forget what my brother had.  I have never been disappointed....serving size so big you will need to take it back to your room for another go at the left overs.   The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because they piped in the sound from the Bingo and it was screeching at our heads.  It brought the atmosphere level way down....My recommendation would be to cut it really low or take it out.  Everyone needs a break from gambling especially when they are eating.   GREAT FOOD......Excellent Service.",VadyAH6xwbe83Jl96XSOhA,0,0,4,QpjRtIPx3SWmobF6-fiZtA

Small casino with easy parking makes it even better.",7RQmQX1rwbQKXsgVueQuYA,0,0,5,HzCUd_EIgL9NmNelCdS9-A
