I phoned in an order for a cheeseburger.  The waitress (Lindsay) I assume was having a bad day and being snarky on the phone regarding my order and questions.  Same bad attitude when I went in to pick up the meal.  When I got home and opened the meal the fries had been super-salted because I asked for regular fries instead of seasoned which come with the meal.  Asked for med-well burger, got med-rare.  I chose a wheat bun instead of white bread bun, the bun was stale.  I'm pretty bummed since this place was a regular for me.  The Manager was quite nice about it and offered to redo the burger but, I just can't eat where they mess with the food when they're moody.",ndpv0rwNoINxRMk2gsUJLA,0,0,1,iIeZaZs9pXuaXASTEBVj3A

The meal I got was a bit salty (buffalo chicken wrap), so I will get something different next time....yes, next time! :)",XcOG8dlswvqmoyootsuuAA,0,1,4,0_76SMim5ZycjoLYi7QJQw
1783819,2017-03-28,0,nD_7R5bVxRYNHKv_dGlhBA,"The Timbers folk did a nice job remodeling this old Viola's pub. We were particularly impressed with the job they did in relocating the front entrance to the west, near the parking area. The landscaping is especially welcoming and pretty now with the floral touches of Pink Indian Hawthorn trees, the bottle brush bushes and jasmine shrubs.  (No, this is not a landscaping review, but I appreciate that Timbers went all-out, or all-in as we say in Vegas, and paid careful attention to the area that greets their guests.)

Patrons enter into the dining area, with the high-backed comfy club chairs around the dining tables, and large booths that surround the dining section. There is the typical horseshoe-shaped bar area and more seating just a little beyond, which we didn't have a chance to check out.  We just found a large, comfortable booth and made ourselves at home.

Immediately, our friendly server introduced herself and took our drink orders.  She was a bit stretched to cover all the diners, but was still very nice and bubbly, and if she wasn't available, then others came by to deliver our food or check on us.  It was a little busy last night, but not crazy--I imagine it will be crazy next Saturday night with the Final Four NCAA games. It's a good Timbers location to catch the games as they must have around 20 TV monitors positioned all around the bar, dining, and seating areas.

The menu was the standard Timbers selection that you can find throughout the valley.  Hubby had the buffalo chicken wrap with kettle chips and he loved 'em.  I had the beef tacos which came in flour tortillas and was also served with a side of corn tortilla chips. The chips were crunchy, salty good.  The tacos would have been better if they could have increased the amount of beef, reduced the lettuce a bit, and added a cilantro garnish?  It would also have been nice if both the green and red sauces, with sour cream, were also included since one little tub of sauce just doesn't service two tacos and chips.  Jes' sayin'.  

And maybe, just maybe, if the Timbers group saw fit to do all that super nice remodeling of the property, maybe they should consider remodeling the menu offerings with some upscale pub food--like PT's did with their Tenaya pub and like you can find at Aces & Ales, nearby competitors.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,0,4,KBfRZ4dtu2eu4FXTNrCuEg

Customers were acting like it was a church. Can't even have a conversation without someone turning around and  looking at you like you have sinned . Funny how the timbers rep comes to our business and begs us to come in twice now. Haha what a joke. Will not return. If you're a miserable gambler and has no social skills this bar is for you if not stay away,iVV5kQz-uNrxKLJZQq2wUA,0,0,1,I429y2YDtVYfIKe1uthv0Q
3584742,2018-05-20,0,nD_7R5bVxRYNHKv_dGlhBA,"We actually stumbled on this bar/restaurant by accident but I can say we were pleasantly surprised. They have a nice quiet dining area separate from the bar with huge comfortable chairs. Tv's of course everywhere with all kinds of sports playing. The food was really good!!!  I had the Sante Fe Salad with chipotle dressing and it was so huge I had to take half home.  (On other days I'm able to finish it now - but I go hungry!). My husband had the chicken wings and stated that he likes them better than BWW's - which is high praise. Haven't tried anything else on their extensive menu but will in the future. They also have a rewards program that you load on your phone. After so many meals you get $20. Off your bill. Always good. I have to add that the waitresses are super friendly and are always right on top of everything which is always good. The manager seems to always be close by as well and has always checked to see if everything is good and if there is anything we need. Love the service!!!!

I've been coming since it was Cactus Club back in the day, but once it changed owners I never really liked it until it became Timbers. Our bartender Rich always takes great care of us & genuinely cares that people are taken care of & happy. Food is great, get the artichoke dip if you stop by, you can thank me later ! So glad this place has owners/employees who care to make it a good place to enjoy again!",fmMoKY19jG3JnFMY_u90BQ,1,0,5,7gCGSxWaRM99ijUqnhFxfw

4786373,2018-06-30,0,nD_7R5bVxRYNHKv_dGlhBA,Nice pub that has recently been remodeled from the ground up.  Great ventilation and decor.  Staff is very accommodating and pleasant.  Food is slightly better than standard bar fare.  If you appreciate beer than you should stay away from their draft selections.  I tried a domestic and a pale ale both of which had a sour taste that is common with dirty taps.  Considering the fact that they don't pay attention to simple details like this makes me wonder what else they may be missing in the back of the house.  It may just be me but the one thing I expect from a tavern is good draft beer.  Besides the sour draft beer the only thing they could do to improve their rating is add food to their happy hour menu like similar establishments in this category.,MhxvHPmDUaxzjU4CMPA5dQ,0,0,3,OQ4_rK7P7YEvdt8j4nuYuw
