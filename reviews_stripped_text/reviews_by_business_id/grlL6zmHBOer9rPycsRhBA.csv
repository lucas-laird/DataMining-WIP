Our sushi chefs, Daniel and TJ, answered questions we had, offered suggestions, and made delicious sushi. The drinks are absolutely amazing.

We sat at the bar and our chef Joon, prepared us some sushi rolls I had never tried before. He's an amazing chef and even better person. Get the Something Gone Roll and let him or any of the other chefs prepare you something of their choosing - you can give input of course but in these scenarios just trust these creative sushi minds! 

Awesome sushi, great ambiance and sake shots on the house for the entire bar when they close at 11pm!!! Check out the video we posted of it in slomo!

Went to Bocho based on Yelp! and overall the food was good.  I had the poke bowl and a chef selected roll, both of which were very good.  The only issue I had was with the overall outside and decor.  First our cab couldn't find the place (close, but amazingly not easy to spot).  Also, the inside was pretty nondescript.  We were seated in a karaoke room.

992645,2014-11-13,7,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"The latest gem to grace Downtown is located at 6th & Carson. Bocho Sushi was born from an idea sparked by Dan Coughlin (Le Thai), backed by DTP and saw to fruition by Jimmy & Becky Chun (recently shuttered Tokyo Japanese Restaurant). The Chun's are at the helm, they are no strangers to day-to-day operations after running their restaurant in Commercial Center for decades. At two weeks new, Bocho Sushi has already reached hotspot status by serving up some delicious eats in a cozy setting. 

Our friends invited us to dinner, upon our arrival, every seat in the house was taken. Downstairs you'll find the sushi bar with counter seating, and upstairs there is intimate seating and large bar. The space has an industrial feel, but I love when old buildings are spruced up and repurposed. The changes to the old Carson hotel have been top notch. This block was once forgotten, but now? It's alive and well. 

The menu will meet all of your sushi and sashimi loving needs. Plus, there is an omakase offering for those seeking an adventurous experience. Sake, beer and cocktails are free flowing. They have not yet begun serving wine, however. We started with orders of Edamame ($3.50) and the Jalapeno Bomb ($5.95). The bomb was ""bomb"" (har), seriously, though, it was delicious. It is hard to go wrong with deep fried jalapeno with spicy tuna and cream cheese. Unfortunately, the Edamame was late to show. It served as dessert. 

A smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi followed: Yellowtail Lover ($9.95), Tiger Roll ($11.95), China Roll ($11.95), Spider Crab Roll ($12.95), Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche ($11.99), Salmon Sashimi ($6.25). The were all well executed. The fish was delicately sliced and extremely fresh. My personal favorites were the Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche with serranos and spicy garlic ponzu, and the China Roll with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. Both selections were bursting with flavor. 

The staff was warm and friendly and our servers were patient & attentive, the only flaw seems to be with timing. I'm confident that they will get that resolved in time. It always takes a new restaurant a bit to find their rhythm. Bocho is currently open for dinner, but lunch service is scheduled to begin next week.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,13,11,4,Kt6nsg35N7_tf3ReqAEjJQ
994228,2017-02-23,0,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"Save your time and money as this place is only meh at best. 

Ordered the tostada but it looked nothing like the pictures on here. The fresh avocado was replaced by mushy guacamole. The tostada was large but the fish on top was small, horrible fish to tostada ratio. Also was topped off with lots of mayo sauce and super hard to eat. Didn't taste fresh at all.

Next was the fried calamari with Japanese marinara. Calamari was ok in terms of tenderness but flavor was lacking. The marinara was really bad, over salted and clumpy, almost impossible to dip into as the sauce was way too thick. After this, didn't even bother to try the sushi.

Final item was the mushroom yaki. Zero seasoning and only can taste the butter.

Tried to order a drink after putting in my starters but the waitress never came back to check on me even though there were 2 servers for 7 people. When I asked for my check, she attempted to clear my plates but got some of the thick marinara on my clothes. Never said sorry.

I entered the restaurant and was seated in a friendly manner

We ordered some food and that's where the problems came

She then argued with us when she told us that we told her twice that that is what we wanted
A large table next to us ordered several things and receive their food before us we were sitting there over 35 minutes without food

As a native I am very keen to find places that make me feel like I am not in Vegas or in Vegas as a city not as a tourist attraction.

This is place was marvelous. Upstairs has the perfect decor with the bare cinder blocks and the raw wood. The one open window let the chilly air and the sounds of the city. I look forward to coming back and eating through the menu again. They were very giving on any changes we wanted to make or ordering things not really on the menu and the prices were reasonable. I am very happy. The food was delicious, the serving staff was amazing..especially the bus boy who overheard us talking about the menu and on offered us their ""chicken nuggets""...he said two words...dark meat, and I was hooked. They were amazing and a fine alternative if you don't like fish and your friends are dragging you to sushi...or if you're a normal person and love adult chicken nuggets...white meat be damned.

The quality is superb. I have eaten in some places that charge many times more for what they are serving and it cannot come close to what is done here. The rolls do not come very quickly, but incredibly reasonably, and each roll is worth its weight in gold. I highly recommend rock n roll and the roll 5...or something with a 5 in it, my taste buds blocked my memory. I could go on and on, their Ocean Trout was unlike anything I have ever tasted and their sushi tacos appetizer makes me want to steal their recipe book.

The sauces are not the main focus of the dish like most other sushi places nowadays, they are a gentle complement to enhance, not to take over, the experience. Easily, my new favorite sushi place. Thank you! I'll be a regular especially at happy hour with 30% off.

And...they have real, freshly grated wasabi available and a wonderful saki selection. Take a moment to leave what you know as Vegas aside and see what Vegas looks like from a local perspective...",GdLch_94GrLQs7tNgcONqw,1,0,5,eTO_8TFT5IZtfB8ty-7TaA

As we walked in we were greeted by a nice young man that promptly seated us, he turned out to be our waiter as well. He was very attentive, polite and had a great smile. We ordered sashimi and were amazed with the quality and presentation. After the sashimi we had the Spanish Mackeral and then a Lobster,Crab Roll they were amazing. If you are a beer drinker try the Asahi on tap, it was sooo cold and refreshing and  went great with the sushi. The finishing touch was their tempura fried ice cream that is wrapped in pound cake. Holy Shit ! 

I found out that this place is owned by the same owner of Le Thai that is located right around the corner. We had lunch at Le Thai the day before and it was just as good. The guy who owns these two gems knows what's up with quality food and great service not to mention the vibe in his restaurants is on point.

So we sat down and started with standards like edamame, shishito peppers, spicy tuna and a Philadelphia roll. Everything was great and we were happy to see a great sushi place now available downtown. 

When we thought we were done some gifts from the kitchen came out like grilled king oyster mushrooms and tuna tostada. A great way to finish our meal and a nice way to make us feel special on our first visit.

This place is so cute! I love the inside and the staff is very friendly. It has two stories. The bottom floor is a long sushi bar with several chairs. I did not see the upstairs but there is additional seating. 

The chairs at the bar are awkward and really squeaky. It was odd and a little embarrassing trying to get in and out of them because they were so noisy.  The food was absolutely worth the weird chairs. 

We ordered several items including the garlic tuna and three rolls. Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. The service was friendly and the sushi chefs were a great time.

Nothing made more noise than Bocho's opening in downtown since Godzilla as it was one of the most anticipated new restaurant openings in downtown.
Bocho (Japanese for knife) will slice you some of the freshest, tastiest and perfectly uncooked pieces of fish you could find in the Las Vegas desert. I've been here a couple times and both times the service was genuine and outstanding.

Service is always a bit sketchy as there always seems to be new servers & their knowledge of the menu is lacking. So is the service!
So it was my birthday & we had reservations. We arrived 20 minutes early & they escorted us upstairs but did not seat us at our table even though we were the only customers up there. Sat us at the bar upstairs but there was an awful sewer odor & when we asked we were told they had sewer issues & we should sit somewhere else!!! Well we didn't choose to sit there! So we asked for our table.
We LOVE the Kumamoto oysters & always get them when we come for an appetizer. So the first time we came the oysters were butchered and the shells were all broken up in pieces in w/ the oysters! We complained & after a wait the proper shucked kumamoto arrived. Second time we came they were beautiful & arrived with Japanese pickled vegetables!
Third time and last time (4th) not shucked well, NO pickled vegetables and they took forever. WHY can't they be consistent with the food and make sure these are done properly? The upstairs began to get busy and before it was too hectic the server took our order. The upstairs is now full and many tables that came in AFTER us are getting their food but so far we have had the oysters & that is it. A table came AND went while we were waiting!! Finally some of the food begins to show up. The sushi rolls and sushi were very good. The fish is very fresh here but the LONG wait...WHY? Happened to us last time too. Had to flag someone down so my husband could get another beer. NO recognition on my birthday at all. This was noted on our reservation. The food is inconsistent  which sucks but the worst is the service. It is really hit or miss. One of my pet peeves about a new restaurant is not caring enough to be consistent in both their food as well as their service. Also I was supposed to receive cash back through Yelp & Groupon. I have yet to receive this!
DON'T advertise this if you aren't going to honor it. Not sure if we want to return. Last two times were meh. Restaurant needs to contact me.",WZRv5LBXPeXPlx3_KegiEw,0,0,3,OWfgbR2wcaLu3HJP_5fsPA

Walking into this place I have to say that I loved the vibe. The restaurant itself is beautiful with so many great details from the modern finishes to the art. We were walked upstairs and that space was equally as great as the sushi bar downstairs. Service was good too. 

I noticed that the lunch specials were really expensive on paper, $16-18 for their sushi plates but we ordered them anyway as the reviews for this place were great. Presentations were very nice & you did receive a lot of food. The fish was fresh & each plate came with a few pieces of sashimi which were really good but everything else that had rice was nearly inedible. The rice was mushy and packed so hard that each piece was really heavy. I couldn't get passed that.

I am a downtown resident.
Don't boo hoo as you guys close down one restaurant after another.
You suck.

You sucked in the beginning so I never came back.
Then I heard there were new people so I gave it a 2nd shot.

I don't have anyone's names, but these servers...sheesh!
I don't know if it's arrogance or ignorance but they think they can remember your order without writing it down.

And then they screw up.
Their attention span is 0.0.

So if you take my incident as a one time only thing, you'll think I'm over reacting but it's the last three times I've been there.

Owners don't comprehend that people go out for a dining EXPERIENCE.
My experiences suck there.

Tonight I sat at bar, ordered 3 of the same type of roll, miso soup, and a cucumber salad.
Waitress brought the cucumber salad and I knew just from looking at it, it was old.
I took a bite just to be sure.
It was awful.
I gave it to the guy behind the counter to take away.

At some point he told the waitress so she came over and asked me if I wanted another one.
I said no.
She brings one anyway.
Get the drift?
Does this girl pay attention on any level?

Then when my sushi came before my miso soup, I asked about my soup.
I said to her, ""did you hear me ask for miso soup?""
She said yes she heard me but forgot.
I said, yes because you didn't write it down!

You're servers. 
Write shit down!
At least TRY to get it right.
I mean there were only three customers in the whole place!

So she came over to check on me.
I told her I was done with this place.
She replied ""everyone makes mistakes"".
Not if you write the order down and pay attention!

That's it.
I am at my breaking point with this place and every other shitty restaurant here.

This is THE ENTERTAINMENT capital of THE WORLD.
People come here from all over the world to go to hospitality school.

Don't think cuz Tony Hsieh throws you some dough that you know how to own a restaurant.

So then she asked if I wanted anything else.
I told her I would never be here again.
She replies, (in high whiny snotty girl voice) ""OK!""

So I said, yeah it's ok cuz you don't own the place.
She says she does.

Even worse.
Good luck chick!",1JW3rbxP2WpnXYOeMyKEWg,3,0,1,vSJhU4VyXl1IJG0H_XCn2Q

1859920,2018-05-12,0,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"Probably the worst dining experience all year, and I go out to eat a lot.  It started it terrible from the beginning.  We had a reservation.  The place was crowded, but far from packed, with several open seats at the bar and several open tables upstairs.  There was no one to check anyone in and there was a pile of people waiting downstairs (where there is really no where to wait).  We waiting about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged, but eventually escorted to a table.  After 10 minutes of sitting down drink orders were taken.  Although the wait staff seemed very very short handed, there seemed to be plenty of people buzzing around.  The appetizer, which was a special was mediocre.  It was slightly too spicy for me, but overall not bad.  Our food took about 25 minutes to be ready... no big deal.  The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes after us, they got their drinks, appetizers, and meal prior to us (they also ordered the same specialty rolls as us, uncooked).  When they brought my meal, it had jalapeños on it, which I had specifically asked to leave out.  They brought my husband the wrong roll all together (glad he noticed initially).  I tried my roll, and it was definitely full of large chunks of jalapeños.  It took over 20 minutes at least to try and change it, but there was really no one around to tell.... my husband finished his meal, and we still waited and waited.  I do not send food back, this has been the first time in years.  My husband said his meal was decent, but nothing special.  
The soy sauce....  they WATER down their soy sauce... who does this????  We frequent sushi/Japanese restaurants at least once per week.   The consistency of their soy sauce was 3 parts water, 1 part soy sauce.    Like most restaurants they probably refill their bottles on the table.  Whatever brand they use is either much much more dilute, or they water it down.  Unbelievable!!!",nzVkHoqdJCR_S-czzrAhqw,1,0,1,Tt20HU45T1K8qxn2jxU6Eg

1962823,2015-08-07,6,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"I had high hopes for Bocho- downtown LV has long lacked a decent sushi joint. Unfortunately, this spot still doesn't quite hit the spot. Fish is fresh, but AYCE is the only reasonable way to go here. Lunch specials are pricey and don't highlight the fish items on the menu.

On two separate lunch visits, I opted for the Shunta Box- Bocho's take on a bento box, with a (heated) fish dish, 4 piece California roll, mixed tempura, white rice, and miso soup. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the small assortment of pickles included as an accent, but even the half-roll I had was falling apart. I'm not the hugest fan of heated salmon, but two visits in a row they have been out of the black cod- other reviews mention this, too. Maybe remove it from the menu and feature it as a special if it's not consistently available, or stock more if you legitimately run out all the time. It was a filling lunch, but there are many places in town to get the same thing, and it won't run me $20 with tip.

Service was fine. I sat at the sushi bar and placed my order directly with the chef, hostess came around frequently to give drink refills. It's nice to have this spot in the downtown area, but they need to kick it up a notch- the special rolls sounded pretty standard and the bartender told another customer the carpaccio-type dishes did not qualify for AYCE pricing?

Looks like late night weekday is staffed by a bunch of 20-somethings -- whom I have absolutely no prejudice against.

Had the Jalapeno Bomb as recommended by our server. I can see how people might love it if they're into that yum-yum sauce / dynamite kind of thing - I'm not particularly fond of this style of American sushi fusion, but again, I can see how people might go crazy for it. Pretty damn tasty, but not my thing.

Garlic Shishito peppers were great - lightly tempura'd and dusted with a mildly spicy paprika-like powder. 

This is a cool, cozy sushi bar space. I know people have expressed their fondness for the upstairs, but I like how it feels sort of 'cozy Greenwich Village sushi spot' downstairs. A very social atmosphere. I found myself having conversations with other parties along the sushi bar.

The sushi bar was full, well, full enough that there wasn't two empty seats next to each other for me and this friend to sit at. So, we had to go upstairs. Bar had two seats. I guess I'll order some sake then, great. What else can I do since I'm unable to get sushi upstairs. This was the first time meeting with this friend. It took 2 bottles of sake to finally get a seat back downstairs. I made my way downstairs and asked the server there to bring my sake, that was just opened, to the sushi bar. He actually refused with a half lame excuse that they ""probably"" already threw it out. Like the 10 guests to 10 employees was just overwhelming and he couldn't go and get my 15 dollar bottle of sake. And I was with someone. What a horrible attitude from this runt. Then it took another extra long seemed like forever time to even place an order for sushi. 3 bottles, 2 rolls, and seaweed salad for 100 bucks and absolutely horrible service...yeah, I'll pass.

Edit : looks like an employee responded to me. As you can see, he doesn't even address the complaints. He tries to tell me they are popular? Oh, ok...good luck. I'm popular too. This links to my Facebook that gets plenty of attention. Little tip: you should not excuse your employees mistakes because you THINK you are popular. Btw, if you read, I mentioned there were 10 guests at the time. If that makes you feel popular, see you in 3 years. Oh, and one of the main complaints is that the little server, who had 2 couple groups (that's it), couldn't make 'my stay as pleasant as possible.'

2334007,2016-03-22,4,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"I was looking for a good sushi spot near me, and saw this was the first on my list on Yelp. Located in Downtown Las Vegas literally 5 minutes away from me. Its next to Carson Kitchen that's how I was able to fin it so quickly. Cute little spot on the corner of 6th and Carson. 

When you walk in its a sushi bar which you have the choice to sit there if you'd like or there is table seating upstairs. Very clean, small but cute and intimate. It was slow when we came, but I don't mind.

We first ordered the Garlic Edamame because we heard our neighbors order it. And I must say best decision on my life. Its a bit spicy but the flavor is amazing and the garlic is not over powering. I could not stop eating them. I wish I had a bowl for myself lol. We also ordered the Jalapeno Bombs which were stuffed with Spicy Tuna and Cream Cheese. Now when I hear Jalapeno Bomb I expected really spicy, but it wasn't that spicy. But still very good. They were deep fried and the jalapenos were fresh. Must try!! Then we ordered the Baked Salmon Roll, a California Roll with baked salmon right on top; very good and tasty. Fish was not too fishy and roll was cut perfectly. We also ordered the Las Vegas Roll which was amaaazing. had eel, cream cheese, avocado and crab - deep fried!! YUM!! 

We ordered the perfect amount of food, and it was not expensive at all, it came out to $35. Not too bad! And if its your first time checking in through Yelp you get a free Sake shot. Our waiter gave me a free shot too! 

I'd totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi spot to go to!",eYW6HKDCOLAf1COkxhVG5g,12,8,5,lOCsg02UFxr-IMI4wdDMWw
2336706,2016-06-27,2,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"I have to start by admitting that I am generally an all-you-can-eat fan. I like sushi in all forms, but my usual mood is ""give me everything you have until I want to die because I am so full of fish."" These places, I am aware, offer more food of less quantity. Bocho sushi is the opposite; you may not get a ton of food, but the quality is excellent! This spot does not offer all you can eat. I came here for dinner with a friend because we had a $25 off coupon. Due to my normal stance on sushi restaurants, I was pretty sure this would be my one and only time eating here, and I was absolutely wrong! I really enjoyed my meal, and I will definitely be back. 

First off, the atmosphere is a small, hip place with an upstairs loft and downstairs sushi bar. We sat at the bar, but we did walk up to look at the loft - it was enticing, but I wanted some of that real sunshine the downstairs area provided. When you sit at the sushi bar, you can see everything they are doing, which is cool. Unfortunately, when I was there it did not look very organized compared to other sushi bars I have sat at. Also, my waiter did not refill my water for almost half an hour, and it was not a busy day/time. This led to what might be called a funny mistake, as a random man walked up to us and asked us if the food was up to par. I assumed he was the manager and replied that it was, but I have not gotten any water since we sat down, and he looked very confused! It turned out he was just some creep talking to us. He came by a few more times and asked us about our food, even though he was just a customer, as we were. It was weird, to say the least, but a good story to laugh about! 

THAT FISH THOUGH!! I tried yellowtail first, and I was hooked. Every piece was so buttery and smooth. All together I ordered a Screaming Orgasm, some edamame, two orders of sushi, and a Rainbow Roll. Together it came out to almost double the price I pay for eight times the amount of food at my regular spot. However, this food was at least twice as fresh and amazing, so I'm not mad about it! I ordered the Rainbow Roll specifically because after trying the yellowtail I knew I needed something with a lot of fish on it, minus some of the extreme toppings on other rolls that cover the flavor. I probably won't be a regular, but I will come back for a quick fix when I am craving some buttery amazing sushi/rolls or maybe on a special occasion when I am looking to up my sushi game.

We started with the Kampachi Sashimi which I have no words for. It was simply perfect and melted right in my mouth. Next was a soft shell crab hand roll topped with salmon.

Lately we've been hearing some negative comments from friends whose opinion I respected especially when it comes to Japanese cuisine.  Well tonight Mrs, youngest daughter and I had a  disappointing dinner.  We were staying at the Orleans and had dinner at the ondori last nite and we're surprised with quality of the fresh seafood, especially the uni, sake and tuna selections.  At Bocho we waited a while to order our drinks and sashimi. The sashimi was presented before our drinks arrived so I waited a few minutes so that I could enjoy the ice cold Japanese beer with the sashimi.  I waited far too long and had never in all my life had such terrible service. The quality of the sashimi was definitely lacking and there was very little conversation between the sushi chef and the customers.  I tried to make conversation with both sushi chefs but was not successful.  It was 6:30 and they were out  of uni and kumbachi, but we were charged for them. Sad to say that Bocho will not be on our Las Vegas restaurant list when we visit twice each year nor will we be recommending it to anyone.

We had made a reservation prior which I would strongly recommend if your planning a gathering of 4 or more.

As you walk in, the staff immediately welcomes you in Japanese and you get a sense of warmth with all the smiles from the chefs and staff.

My group were led upstairs to a very Art Deco asian inspired loft with a bar and the first thing I noticed was the place setting giving the atmosphere a polished dining experience.

The wait staff were friendly and efficient, shout out to Taylor, our waiter, he did a wonderful job of anticipating our needs.

After drinks and starters, our meal arrived in a timely manner, there were some unexpected downfalls, not from the waiter but from the arrival of some of the dishes.

The beef Gyoza arrived but they seemed to be a little cold, one person in my party had some bones in her salmon, but we were more concerned for other patrons that we let him know so no one else would encounter what one of my dining members encountered.

A slight mix up of yellow tail sushi - but quickly recovered, we still, overall enjoyed ourselves.

The prices are typical of what you would expect of a sushi place and the presentation of all the food we ordered, was visually appealing and tasty.

I discovered they have a couple of private rooms that could host a nice group guests for a more seclusive and intimate experience. I also learned that there will Karaoke available for those rooms for a little entertainment.

The background music was fun and enjoyable and wasn't intolerable.

This is definitely a nice place to enjoy great Japanese cuisine before hitting the rest of downtown Fremont, I would suggest that if you love sushi, definitely hit this place up.
At the bar, you can sit if you're flying solo or if your a couple.

The experience overall is comforting and enjoyable, besides the couple of minor incidences, I think the rating I gave is fair.

I will definitely recommend rhis place to others.

-They take reservations! I called in and they were happy to take a party of 9 for the same night.  A lot of AYCE places don't take reservations.
-menu was extensive you can either order ala carte, or 30$ for all you can eat.  I would recommend the all you can eat, it's worth it.
-The AYCE menu is huge and the sushi was Very fresh and tasty. They don't serve lots of rice and a small fish on top to fill you up, it was opposite the rice was small and the fish was a big portion. great deal. The fisherman in our group gave their thumbs up on the quality.  
-We had a really nice private room for our group and we had Free Karaoke! 
I asked about this and it's free when ordering 100$ or more, this was no problem for us. We had a great night eating, drinking and singing till closing.
-Lastly this place opened 6 months ago so it's new and nicely decorated.
-over all great sushi place that's close to downtown

The only Con was that the area that it was in didn't look so Hip from the outside, but inside it was awesome!!  We'll be here again next trip to Vegas",pVv-5hv6FsyvTRo1uaNGuA,4,4,5,hmmKajx4f_GHMxboGX6GIg

Regular lunch and dinner menus are offered, but if you want the AYCE experience, you can have that too. Both my friend and I ordered the AYCE dinner, which is 30 bucks per person. The menu is unlike the exhaustive list of specialty rolls, entrees, and appetizers found at other sushi restaurants; although, it doesn't include items offered on their regular menu. 

Sitting on the second floor loft beats eating at the crowded sushi bar. I do like how the two are separated. The bar was much busier and louder as opposed to the laid-back atmosphere above. Plus, the seats are cushioned and there are pillows!

Here's what I ordered, and I'd most likely select these again.

* Calamari Skewers (yeaah, squid on a stick!)
* Baked Salmon Roll
­* Crunch Dragon Roll
* Las Vegas Roll
* Unagi
* Masago (no quail egg available)
* Garlic tuna 
* Fatty tuna 
* Octopus 

My favorite roll was the baked salmon with cream cheese, avocado, crab, and baked salmon on the outside. The sashimi was also delicious. I wouldn't mind returning to eat just sashimi and calamari skewers.

After ordering our sushi the rolls took 15 minutes to come. The drinks took 10. Our server explained that the bartender was very busy and we then realized that there was only one bartender for the entire restaurant.

When our food came we found the fish fishy. The imitation crab in the rainbow roll was blergh and the shrimp was so dry it was almost crunchy (it wasn't tempura).

We got two rolls, one sashimi, and one sushi. For the sushi the rice fell off of the fish as soon as we tried to pick it up (sign of bad sushi making). When we walked past the sushi bar it smelt fishy. The bocho martini was bitter and tasted like straight up cucumber peel. I sent it back.

The John E. Carson roll and the Garlic Tuna sashimi were tasty. However, we spent $5 less than we would have at our favorite AYCE place (Sakana) and Sakana has better quality fish and better service.

They took our order, with no indication of a problem, then proceeded to pile food in front of us as fast as they could make it. Some things were one per person, some were evidently meant to be shared. No explanation of what was being served. At one point the waitress took an untouched dish from its serving tray and put it on our side plates so that she could add another dish in front of us. Meanwhile they're sweeping up around us. 25 minutes before closing we indicated we were feeling rushed. Our server hid in a corner. The manager? apologized, but the damage was done. To be honest, the apology did not seem that genuine anyways.

You only receive FOUR peppers though they are large. Taste was fine. Mussels were kind of strange. I thought tasted OK, DH did not. Roll was very mushy and not spicy at all. Sake was fine.

OK, back to getting the bill. Waiter obviously saw we were ordering off app menu and we confirmed with him about the 30% discount. So he drops bill at the table and charges us for 2 AYCE dinners!

And this roll does not have any rice in it! Man.. they were spicy and sweet at the same time! And all those seafood just melted in your mouth! Soo gooodd. I'm getting hungry just writing this! 

And the second roll we ordered was baked salmon! That salmon though! Andrew you are the man!! Glistening pink on the inside and cooked perfectly out and super flaky! Just pretty epic I would say! 

And we also ordered their fried chicken which what we always get there and baked mussels! 

Well after all!!!! It's always a pleasure with this guy! Never a complaint and if I can give them 100stars I really really would!! Thank you guys so much!! Keep it up!!",iA_7Ek8zvH1tXVRQtk3L2A,0,0,5,PcTFnaj4u_4EGQpjyv8_QA

1. The service was slow.  The restaurant was only half full.  2. The food was maybe a 5/10 
The flavor was bland, the rolls had too much rice to my liking. 3. We ordered sushi: I waited over ten minutes for wasabi and ginger after the sushi was delivered.  I had to ask three times.  One waitress just said, no (she wasn't our waitress, but still)
4. The price was not worth the quality.  It's way over priced.  There's so many other places that are so much better especially in Vegas.

I think this deal was better than the AYCE because the AYCE didn't seem too wide of selections. Plus the AYCE is $28. If I'm going to spend that much on AYCE, I expect their menu choices to be more. My friend and I shared 3 rolls with a mushroom yaki order for our appetizer. We got the Ryan, Poke Monster, and Dirty Sanchez rolls. They were all delicious. It was packed with rice, plenty of fish, and flavor. I like how they put the tuna and seaweed salad on top of the poke monster. It made it unique and more flavorful. There is a kick in the dirty sanchez roll. I think there's a small jalapeño in it so watch it if you're not expecting spicy or a kick. The mushroom yaki appetizer was simple. It was sliced mushroom  drowned in butter. Yummm butter. We were so full and we didn't even finish our rolls. I had to take a little bit home. It definitely fills you up and all of this was only $35! Split it between 2 people was $17-18 a person which I think in my opinion is a better deal than the $28 for AYCE. I saw the people next to me do AYCE and they ordered less than us and didn't eat their moneys worth.

This place is for people who don't know sushi. Sadly it was the only place we could find downtown and the reviews were misleading. If you have never had sushi before and all you eat are rolls covered in mayo and sauce then this may be your place. 
If you seek out sashimi or nigiri then you best move on. We tried 8 different pieces and to cap off the lousiness of the preparation we were served the most rubbery Ebi I have had outside of a vending machine in Japan. WAIT. That Ebi was much better. 
I still can't get over the response to the sashimi question. No adjustment or replacement. Just a promise for a visit that will never happen. I hope enough people read this review to put them off this experiment.

4368145,2018-06-21,0,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"I stayed downtown for three nights, and two of my dinners were l here. That tells you something. 

They have an all-you-can-eat offering on Tuesday nights after 6 p.m. It's $28.95 for 1 hour where you can order off a special AYCE menu that doesn't include everything on the standard one, but has some things that aren't on the regular menu. Sadly, the photo I took of the AYCE menu came out blurry, and I was going to rely on it to list everything that I tried and liked. I'll save that for the update since I am going again next week.

I sat at the bar where Brian and Carlos prepared all of my dishes. Brian was particularly nice in putting up with my lame non foodie conversation even though he was clearly very busy. If he's around, I recommend sitting in front of him.

The food was great. It's definitely up there in the top 2 sushi places I have ever been to, and the other place is no longer in business. Particularly memorable was the maguro nigiri, which really tasted fresh and very tuna-like, in a good way. The ebi nigiri also tasted different from every other place I have been too I guess because it was so fresh. The texture was the difference. Each of the rolls were massive. The only item that didn't do it for me was a roll that had deep fried batter, which seemed a little heavy for me. Everyone around me was having the Poke monster, so I tried it during happy hour two nights later. Incredible, and really satisfying. 

My two hosts were Marcy and Ryan, and they are to be commended for their cheerfulness and service.

Bocho Sushi inhabits a little corner on Carson Street next to O Face Donuts and Carson Kitchen. The inside, while cramped when you first walk in as you are greeted directly by the bar is stylish and modern with contrasting light wooded walls and floors and dark chairs. Head upstairs for a better vibe. Tables are low, accompanied with pillows, a small bar in the back, and the Mad Men theme song playing over the speakers (seriously, I think I heard it around 4 times while we dined).

My friend and I embarked upon their AYCE dinner menu for $30. While their menu is not as extensive as many sushi spots in Vegas, I didn't have an issue selecting many items to suit my preference. 

We had the following:
Spicy Tuna Hand Roll
Jalapeno Bombs
Mushroom Yaki
Calamari Skewers
Seaweed Salad
Super White Tuna
Shrimp
Octopus
Oysters on the half shell
Green tea mochi ice cream

Rolls
Salmon Skin Roll
Las Vegas Roll

I may be missing a roll in there somewhere.

Overall the sashimi and regular rolls were great and fresh, served quickly with not too much wait time between ordering and finishing other rolls on our table.

The Las Vegas Roll was way too filling. I wouldn't suggest it while eating AYCE as it will fill you up since it has both cream cheese AND it is deep fried. It was just a little overpowering for me, so I wouldn't get this one again.

I did enjoy the spicy tuna hand roll, the super white tuna, and the jalapeno bombs - very spicy, definitely try those. 

Service was great, our Green tea and waters were kept filled. I wouldn't say this is and AMAZING place to get sushi, but if you're in the area it totally fills the spot for sushi in a good way. I will be back.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,4,dAC85sv0DU0y_9aax5SSeQ

I was the only customer and in 15 minute sitting 4 feet away from him and his work area, he completely ignored the concept that I was there to eat sushi. No acknowledgment, not even a glance as he continued to wipe his unused knives over and over and over, wiping down and organize all of his condiment bottles, wrapped a cucumber that was wedged under his cutting board and toss it into the refrigerator while nudging other items inside the fridge with his foot before closing the door. Final straw... with still no sushi service, three new customers were sat next to me and he focused on them serving the ASAP. That's it!!! I paid my tea/miso/soy bean order the waiter brought me. Before leaving I put a penny on the counter and related to the rude sushi dude that this penny was for his service (he deserved less).

4586358,2018-06-08,0,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,This is a hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas.  My wife and I wanted sushi before visiting the neon museum and this fit the bill.  The food and staff are second to none.  I would easily pay double for this quality and service likely on the strip.  Highly encourage anyone to try it.  Easy parking available in a lot across the street.  The roll prices are very affordable and they have specials.  My wife really enjoyed their tuna with crispy rice.  We also tried the melting albacore and ate many rolls that were out of this world.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and we hope to visit it again.  They might be in the middle of the desert but the fish is as fresh as anywhere.  Give it a shot and don't forget the garlic edamame! Yum,EWx22l2OrvCepOmJ8_984w,0,0,5,pmL8SW7LWk0-qiUQH0MOyQ

He was even kind enough to ask and make sure we had no allergies of any sort before preparing the rolls.

After serving us our food, he began to filet a whole salmon on the counter. As he was about to throw away the salmon head, he joked and asked if any of us wanted it. To his surprise, a friend of mine wanted it and the chef was gracious to wrap it up with ice for my friend!

We had already eaten, so we didn't go in. After some time, my friend wanted to go order food to go, so she went and we met up with her. 

This place is not that big, but not small. Has 2 floor with karaoke rooms on the second floor. Pretty cool setup. 

When we met up with her, she asked if she could have it there and they had no problem and took us to a seat. Even though she placed her order already, the lady asked if we needed anything. We waited, but not long and the food came out. I wasn't hungry, but food and I have this sort of relationship where if it's placed in front of me, and offered, I will eat it. So I caved. But let me tell you it was well worth it! I don't even remember what my friend ordered, but it was so good. I just kept eating the rolls haha! I believe there were 3 different rolls and they each were so tasty and so fresh. Also, when you check in you get a free shot of sake. I personally don't like sake because it taste like I'm drinking nail polish remover. So I can't tell you if it's hot or cold. But if that's your thing, have at it. 

I definitely would like to come back here and try other rolls they have on the menu. Maybe even hop up and sing some karaoke. Mmm no maybe not the singing part.",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,0,0,4,nBn1pEaxXd036eGevDfOkw

The servers were wonderful, and didn't mind me ordering extra sauce with everything or being ""that girl"" who makes substitutions in rolls (stop judging me - lol).

That said, every roll was great-- the tuna wasn't mealy or super muscular and chewy-- it was perfect. Also, the fried chicken sounds like a weird thing to order at a sushi restaurant, but it's a MUST-try! Soooo good!!

Their baked mussels (I've eaten many shells inside the baked mussel) , rolls, rock shrimp and sake are to die for! Service is usually a hit or miss.

5123838,2015-01-18,0,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"I'm always downtown and for quite some time, a good majority of regular patrons have been wanting a sushi spot to finally venture. Sad to say, Bocho did not leave a good impression.

I had been looking forward to trying this ever since rumors began to surface of a sushi restaurant opening downtown. I've heard of mixed reviews from friends since it's opening so rather than take others words for it, finally decided to check it out. 

The sushi bar downstairs if basic and reminds me of something you may find in Los Angeles or New York where space is at premium. It is very well lit as you walk in and are greated by the chefs. There is also an upstairs dining area that is a bit more spacious and can accommodate larger groups and there is also a private room available, the cocktail bar is also located upstairs. 

As we sat down, our server greeted us quickly and asked if we'd like drinks. Water and a beer were ordered and brought to the table promptly followed by complimentary edamame. Quite a few things were ordered off the menu and I can say that the fish was very fresh, the flavors of the sauces and condiments used for rolls were very tasty, no complaints there. The one major thing I had an issue with and anyone who loves sushi should have an issue with is hard, dense, undercooked rice. I mean, you're a sushi restaurant and you use rice all day long. How could your one major ingredient be under par, especially since it is the base for all of your dishes. Again, the fish was fresh and delicious but you can't have a good sushi restaurant if you can't produce good rice! 

Our bill was split in 3 which our server did not mind doing so but she was not very attentive when it came to keeping my water glass full and checking to make sure things were going okay. 3 people ordered separate orders and some of them were mixed together (sushi). When we asked our server to clarify what was what, she got very flustered and said she did not know how to differentiate the rolls. Also, the table next to us had a big group and they asked our server to take a picture of them which of course would've not bothered me if she had not practically climbed on our table to take a picture of them, not even excusing herself as we were still finishing up our meal, very unprofessional. 

So overall, will I go back??? Maybe, possibly. If they can cook their rice properly.",AQ0NRRasg_FA403S5gKEDA,2,0,3,ICs8xtfwuKyNsK4-wID4wA

Normally Bubs and I do AYCE (not available here btw) because we can throw down when it comes to sushi. Here we shared 4 rolls and were stuffed. 

I HIGHLY recommend the ""Something Wong"" roll. Basically, it's whatever the chef feels like concocting customized with things you like. Ours turned out being a seared (with a blowtorch! So cool to watch) yellow tail & salmon roll with spicey mayo, a smokey glaze, a little cream cheese and avocado. Panty dropper. Oh sweet baby Jesus it was good. We saved the plate to dip the rest of our rolls in the remaining sauce. 

We sat at the bar and got great service. Ended up staying longer than anticipated because we were chatting with our server. Also ended up being part of a group Sake bomb. Next time I'm in town and craving sushi I will be coming back to Bochos.",954LjeI04TUwhnlJyHbLzg,1,1,5,KUGismvkd88CIyxHhu2N3w

5307788,2015-01-18,5,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"I like Bocho's space, very LA/NY loft style with a lot of potential. Two levels, with bar seating downstairs and bar/tables upstairs. I felt like a little more consideration could have gone into the plates. I don't care for the cheap, plastic plates you can buy at your local asian grocery (in fact, I think 168 probably has better choices). The tables are also a little too small for the long plates the sushi comes on. 

Service is ok. The server was nice to start, but she took a very long time to bring our water and an even longer time to bring drinks. She did not check in on us after the food was brought either.

For appetizers, we chose Seaweed Salad and the Jalapeño Bomb (jalapeño stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese). The salad came with a mix of romaine lettuce, which seemed a little weird and filler-ish. The stuffed jalapeño was good for it's uniqueness, but by no means life changing.

Bocho Special Roll (tuna/crab/cucumber with shrimp tempure/crab/assorted fish on top), it was basically a glorified California roll. It was way too big to eat in one bite and it didn't leave any lasting impressions.

Sashimi was fresh, with large pieces. We ordered Garlic Tuna, Yellowtail, and Super White Tuna. We ended up receiving regular tuna, instead of garlic, which isn't the end of the world, but a little disappointing.

I don't really see how this place can be given 5 stars. It makes me wonder what the other reviewers think is good sushi... It's really not ""as good as it gets,"" when there are so many better restaurants out there. I'm happy to see downtown expanding their culinary tastes, but Bocho has a long way to go before they are the best.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,9,6,3,4fj5PbxXQPegV1QokR-KBA

I'm not a fan of cramped spaces and the seats at the bar had no space in between. Getting up and going to the bathroom to wash my hands was very frustrating for me and I'm not even fluffy.

However, the food was amazing and the service was great. The fish was fresh and the portions were just right. Lunch specials are available from 11am-3pm and AYCE from 4-11pm.

Shunga Box:
This is part of their lunch special. For $15, you can get salmon, saba or black cod. Comes with California roll or spicy tuna roll, miso soup, sunomono salad, rice, tempura and a drink. The black cod was great. 4/5

Sashimi Salad Bowl:
Diced fish including salmon, tuna, whitefish, and hamachi. Includes miso soup and a drink. Generous amount of protein and the most filling salad I've had. 5/5

Nigiri:

5407346,2015-06-16,3,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"So I wanted to find an awesome AYCE  sushi place closer to the house.  I looked on Yelp and found the place closed at 10:30 and I knew I was going to be cutting it close.  So I called and spoke with a Carlos and asked what time the last seating was, just to make sure I wasn't imposing.  Most places will set their final seating an hour before they really mean to close.  Kaya Sushi for example close at 3am on most days so they set their final seating at 2:15am.  Well Carlos, told me their final seating was 10:15 pm, so I was off.  I get to the downtown area and find a parking spot about a block away, which is as expected.  I paid for my parking spot and headed to Bocho Sushi.  I walked in and there were still about a dozen people in the place in various phases of their meal. I checked the time and thought awesome I made it (10:14pm). I ask the host if I can eat at the bar and she begins to seat me.  I start getting settled in and she asked if I was there for all you can eat or ala carte.  I stated all you can eat...  And she began telling me about it when one of the chefs said, No!  No, all you can eat after 10:15.  The hostess seemed somewhat surprised at this and briefly questioned it before apologizing and offering the ala carte menu.  But since I am on a mission to find a closer AYCE I declined.  I might try this place again but for two employees to seem to think it was ok for AYCE only to be over ruled by the chef after the customer looked for parking and paid for parking not to mention took the time and energy to give the establishment a try for the first time is somewhat unacceptable in my opinion, not to mention the communication breakdowns.  

Now let me just clarify for those who will say yeah but with big parties I would want to serve super late either....  Well, I was by myself so it wasn't like I was entertaining a large party.  I was on a mission, so to speak!  Lol.

I went with some locals who had never heard of it (I found it on Yelp), and they said that this would be their new go-to place for sushi. First, the place was packed -- so I would recommend reservations. I started with some tasty baked mussels and the ""dynamite"" -- a baked dish of scallops, crab, mushrooms, and onions. You couldn't really eat it with the chopsticks, and I would take a pass next time. I asked for tako sunomono, and the waiter seemed confused. I explained that I just wanted octopus on my cucumber salad. Pretty common in most sushi places. When it came it was three large slices of octopus on the cucumber salad. I was trying to figure out why there wasn't the usual dressing on the salad. After digging down I found out, there was lettuce under the large mound of cucumber, and the dressing was at the bottom of the pile. The seaweed salad also had lettuce under it. Odd. Everything else was terrific. I had my usual array of nigiri -- hamachi, salmon, yellow tail, salmon eggs, and toro. I didn't expect to find salmon (sake) this fresh in Vegas, but I think it's probably the best salmon sushi I've had. And this is from someone who lives just outside of Seattle.

The place is clean, and the staff are friendly for the most part. It is small, so it fills up quickly!

The shrimp tempura roll, Crunch Dragon, and the Rock & Roll are all good. That isn't my issue.

The issue is that when they ask ""miso soup or salad,"" and you order miso soup instead of salad, you are charged extra. Several in our party had the same issue, and attempted to rectify the issue prior to paying. So the waitress left with our checks to correct them - and never came back!

WHY do sushi restaurants note ""crab"" as an ingredient in the roll when no crab whatsoever is in the roll?  While this may not be unique to Bocho, the charge for ""real"" crab may be.  At first the less-than-knowledgeable waitress stated that the ""upcharge"" would be $5 per piece, she then returned with an updated amount...$40 for the roll.  Holy Crab, Batman!  So, a roll that supposedly has ""crab"" in it is $12 on the menu but when you ask for ""real"" crab (instead of the ocean's version of a hot dog, aka, imitation crab meat or surimi), it jumps to $52?  That better be some DAMN GOOD CRAB MEAT!!!!  

We had the Pink Lady roll and that was fine, nothing too special.  We also had the Tempura Shrimp...same thing, it was fine...same as you can get anywhere.

I really do hope you get the opportunity to get Anthony as your sushi chef. Can't wait to visit so I can come here again. 10 STARS",Koe00eelasvwHko1vT33Rw,0,0,5,a93wcJ1-RxvmPrOAIFH5QA

Located down the street from Container Park, this small sushi spot is definitely a great spot for grub and drinks. The homie and I got a couple of rolls and some sake bombs. I was really impressed with the quality of the sushi. Overall, if you're looking for some delicious sushi in Downtown Las Vegas then definitely come check out this spot.",78c_llOEjlJ5lW35bL137w,1,3,5,p2QQ0Q9eF7YsgWwA79FnIg

I wanted so badly to love it. None of their rolls, or sushi stick out in my mind. Average. They don't offer the bento box for dinner. Disappointing when dining with children.  There aren't many sushi spots downtown, but many other excellent restaurants. I'll have to get my sushi fix some place else.",WnIDoootZDDKKMvJFQqTRg,1,0,3,jr7699Vlf2PQsTcttx1zmg

5922121,2016-02-28,0,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi but this place rocks my world. Super picky about Tako specifically and here it tastes awesome. Not fishy at all a the texture is just right. Don't forget to use your IndiCard here! And happy hour is 30% off everything including sake which they have a great selection of.,W8JJGXuBqhdmQoSDoB7Wqg,0,0,5,tv1Aa8a8freTkWjF8kImNQ
5946221,2015-03-16,1,grlL6zmHBOer9rPycsRhBA,"Good, but nothing special.

The place is small and it has two floors. It is interesting.... It is not something I would have ever noticed if I weren't looking for it.

I really enjoyed the rock and roll, however, there was seaweed inside the cucumber which is unusual.

The Philadelphia roll had salmon on the outside, cream cheese and avocado inside. It tasted okay, however the slices of salmon were extremely thin. When fish is on the outside and the roll costs more because of this I would expect thicker slices.

The jalapeno bombs were yummy, though some were much hotter than others.

The rainbow roll was good.

The seaweed salad was good. It was a good size. There was lettuce under it, and a tomato and an orange slice on top. 

The sake was warm. I prefer it hot as it cools down quickly.",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,1,2,3,tKzsh9XjAeIy_x8kIRNF8Q

The food is still as delicious as ever, I love the decor, and the vibe here. Definitely not disappointed with this place. Service was good, our server was very attentive and made great suggestions. 
So glad that there's a great sushi spot downtown!",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,0,2,5,gXto1WSClvuitU__GTTg-w

Service is friendly albeit slow.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,10,3,RytZ-vcluH3eVeeuTqT-_A
