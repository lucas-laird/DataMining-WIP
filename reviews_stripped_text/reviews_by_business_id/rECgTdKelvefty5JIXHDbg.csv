it took everything in me to calm my husband down and not let him deck the guy. I told my husband that I would report it. 

Getting home, I called and reported the situation to corporate. they said I would receive a call from someone immediately.

Tori, the district manager called me the next day and gave me the lamest excuse Ive ever heard. Her exact words were, ""Well, he does that to everyone, its just who he is. I mean, he even winks at me all the time and I'm not eve a pretty woman."" Um, okay?! How does this make it right. i was furious and told her so. She continued to defend his actions saying he does it all the time. Excuse me, but I was a manager at a restaurant once upon a time and 1. winking is considered sexual harassment. 2. Its not appropriate for him to do that to a customer and definitely not his boss, the district manager. If he is allowed to do that and get a way with it, I can't imagine what he does to the female workers under him.

Called corporate again and yet, again nothing done. Not even an apology.

This location is an epic fail. 

Each time we go they mess the order up to the point of being ridiculous. 

I have ordered a hamburger pickle only and get a hamburger with ketchup only. Order on the screen is correct, tag on the burger is correct leading me to believe they either can't read or are too busy playing around to pay attention to the order they are prepping. 

Today I ordered two number ones repeated myself 3 times. The order taker told me my order was 5.00 umm that would be for one. We get the order corrected and I moved into the next window. That lady kept saying I ordered one number 2. She gave me 3 straws and when got home one of the egg mcmuffins wasn't even wrapped but it looked like they tossed it in the bag. The hashbrowns were not crispy. 

My exact comment to my husband was ""we won't have to worry about any of this because when we get home from vacation, I am cooking all our meals"". 

The only plus is this location doesn't have the ""new"" straw stripper that half way inserts the straw into your drink.

I then reminded them of it and they assured me it would be right out, so I asked to speak to a manager because it's now 7:40 and I need to leave to get across town for church, so the manager arrived and I told her the situation but did i get to speak and press my issue? No! I was cut off and yelled at and I then informed her how long I waited after which she went and made me a large fry and put it in the bag, I tried one while walking out the store and they were cold so I went back and told her and she told me to wait until the fresh ones come in 4 mins after the argument and the wait on the fries it was now 7:48 and I have only 10 mins so when the fries finished I took them and left! The whole time I was there not one employee said I'm sorry sir or anything! NOTHING! Although this is the closest McDonald's to my house I will no longer eat here!",C4Xr_ZkyVQhAW-LxVelj6Q,0,0,1,w9V18fz35PnvM_k8LDJQ2A

There has not been a visit where something did not get messed up...from a simple ketchup request to forgetting basic parts of the meal. In my most recent visit (4/4 @ approx. 7:45pm should management actually read these) the employee at the last window was so stoned he could not comprehend anything. He then proceeded to forget my sons cheeseburger and forget my ketchup packet request in the 10 ft he walked to get the food. The food is always poorly made and never hot when I receive it. I try to limit my McDonalds trips, however after 6 tries I will completely eliminate this McDonalds. Ownership and Management must be uninvolved or incompetent at this location.",27JX6k0P_1TrQhtsZ1Nilg,1,0,1,vZWxWId5dEOt4SeXwiv82A

Alright, not really. But they work at McDonalds. Can you really blame them for being blasé about it?

The wait in the drive thru is almost always pretty long. The food is standard McDonalds food. I haven't had any issues with my order being incorrect.",DBm03EUUIFGOqB_CmWp9FA,0,0,3,5I0CPRSOxMi-kBXaoOJOCQ

Didn't like the staff behind the cashier using derogatory terms about whoever they were talking about.  I know it wasn't me as the term they were using is generally not reserved for white females.  Really unprofessional. 

Location is great. On the southwest side of the street on Spring Mountain and Durango.  It's attached to a gas station so you can multi-task!

Lots of parking and parking for your bike too!",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,3,2,3,am_lEHcb1glMb18as0QJGQ

Inside also long line stood there for about 10 minutes and no one is taking my orders. I have to be back at work and only get 30minutes of lunch break. (I only had 12mins to eat) Since my break was at 945am everything is close. McDonald's was the only one open before 10am.

In the past three months they gave me a pico guacamole burger but forgot to add guacamole and  another time they gave me a cheeseburger when I ordered a breakfast sandwich. Yesterday, however, was the trifecta. I wanted a pico guacamole burger, but they told me they were out of signature craft burgers, they didn't ask what drink I wanted with my meal and just gave me a coke and they forgot to give me an apple juice with my happy meal.

I probably shouldn't be eating McDonald's anyways.",sKDex2EvIFDNapxk5FzCQw,0,0,2,ZdIRTpJIY-DX1ixJL9T_sA

I am a basketball mom and once a week i take the girls out somewhere for food. Let me tell you anytime we come to this location it is nothing but TROUBLE for us. 

The last time they left a big mac and sausage mcmuffin out of our order and the ""Manager""  says you come store pick up you order."" Listen for 1. Where is my apology for making me wait in front of your restaurant for 10 minutes then you send me home with half my order missing and direct me to just come back and get it. 

Your lack of commitment to customer service at this location is disgusting and it should be closed down. What is the point there is one on Buffalo and Flamingo anyhow. 

So I called this so called corporate phone # this lady Leddy, Sandra and Denora all complete jerks who should never be left to deal with customers. No return Call , all of the sudden when I ask for Franchise Information they dont have it yet its posted to call Jennifer on their glass window. 

My phone got disconnected and this Rude human Sandra proceeds to tell me after i say Hey my phone got disconnected May I have the franchise phone number she starts yelling at me about how I was rude to the manager. Are you kidding me? You let these women verbally lynch a customer over their Horrid Customer service? 

God this place is DISGUSTING DON'T GO HERE!",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,1,0,1,1dKfbIxIdvd6iDMVS_2Wcg

The napkin dispenser was out of napkins before I arrived, and after picking up by din-in order and letting the manager know I needed napkins for the messy hands I am going to have to wipe eating 2 ""Saucy"". No ketchup packets and that ketchup dispense into those paper cup thing is not out either.

So the place looks rather messy for a McDonalds, especially during the day.  

Food is served as expected. Not fancy. Not as good looking as it appeared in advertising. But still met the low expectation of childhood comfort food. Although I am way over the whole McNugget craving, since they switched to super-processed mechanically separated chicken meat a decade or two ago.

Anyway, I came for the McRib. Ate two of them. And that craving will more than likely be well satisfied for at least another year. Next time I am back will be for the fries.

Minus a star or two for this location for slumming it.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,2,yGRXypILorRAfVbrJsO3WQ
