All for $6.99.  Not too bad of a deal price wise. 

The food was okay. The size of the chicken strips were small, and I have to say the coleslaw was a disappointment! Absolutely  no flavor!  Will I come here again? Yes, but I won't drive out of my way to come here like I did today. If I happen to be in the neighborhood I would stop by...oh and they charge you .38 for an extra sauce.

I love Raising Canes, but I like this place a little more. The chicken is fresher and more flavorful, and the skin is a little crisper. Their sauce has more flavor. Overall, the food is fresher and a little better quality.

Plus, the price is very good. $6.99 is a good price for a fresh lunch. Plus the wait time is better, 5 minutes at Guthrie's compared to +20 minutes at RC's. I have been there multiple times and the service is good to great. The decor is bland at best, but I usually don't go to fast food for decor. Besides, they have a TV there and it usually has sports on, which is a plus.

2059823,2012-11-29,0,zzzaIBwimxVej4tY6qFOUQ,"Guthrie's is all about one main thing: chicken strips. They have a concise menu that includes fried chicken strips, grilled chicken strips, sides (toast, fries, cole slaw), and salad. Their chicken strip offerings include a sandwich, small or large combo box, and varieties of chicken strip buckets/meals.

I went there for lunch, and had:
1 Fried Chicken Strip Box ($6.99):
- 5 fried chicken strips
- 1 side of crinkle-cut fries
- 1 small cup of cole slaw
- 1 small cup of Guthrie's sauce
- 1 piece of buttered toast

1 fried apple pie ($0.99)

1 medium fountain drink

Notes:
- The food is cooked hot and fresh, not ready-to-go from a heat rack.
- The fried chicken strips are lightly breaded, crispy, and juicy. The focus is clearly on the chicken, not on batter or breading.
- The toast was surprisingly good - thick cut, crispy, chewy, and buttery. I found myself wishing I had more than one piece to go with my meal.
- The crinkle-cut fries were cooked nicely - crispy, not burnt, and not soggy.
- The cole slaw was excellent, although the portion is quite small.
- The sauce was pretty good - almost like a variant of a spicy ranch type sauce.
- The apple pie was completely coated in sugar and cinnamon. It was good, but very messy. The amount of cinnamon and sugar coupled with the fried dough gave it a churro-like flavor.

Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I'm fond of places that focus on doing one thing really well, and Guthrie's is that kind of place. I don't know if their salads or grilled chicken strips are any good, but if you're in the mood for their staple - chicken strips and fries - you can do far worse than Guthrie's.",jhaT21VWZVtW2zXPVmzeyg,4,0,4,1WgXVPm4FuMQl07COCBtyw

The food: much like canes but on a smaller scale, chicken strips were small, toast was avg in size, good size fries and the dipping sauce and cole slaw were as expected.

3044359,2013-07-27,0,zzzaIBwimxVej4tY6qFOUQ,"This location used to be a KFC, I went there one day and they were closed. Drove by sometime later and saw they were putting a Guthrie's in, never heard of it.

I was working in the area and I like to try new places, gives me something to yelp about, so I went to try Guthrie's.

Think Raising Cane's, without the logos, they would be hard to differentiate.

Chicken fingers, crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw and toast, that's the menu. Actually, they also had pies and salads and the fingers could be on a bun for a sandwich.

The differences between Guthrie's and Cane's:

The chicken fingers are available fried or grilled. There are more sauce choices than the signature sauce, ranch, buffalo, etc..

The fingers were good (a little small), fries were alright, the toast was excellent, coleslaw (I don't like coleslaw, so I'm not one to judge)

The counter girl was smiling, charming and friendly (I added a star for that) .  Much better customer service than the Cane's at Decatur and Charleston.
The food, since the only comparison is Canes, it's a coin toss, not enough difference to choose one over the other. Pick the one that's closest. (in Vegas that would probably put you at Cane's, since Guthrie's only has one location here)

All in all, I would go there again, if I'm in the area and in the mood for fingers.
 
That's the double-edged sword of specialty restaurants, they make one thing, so they should be good at it. Ex. In and Out, they only make burgers, they are good at it. Guthrie's make chicken fingers, they are good at it. But, if you're with a group of people in the mood for different things, it doesn't work.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,1,0,3,jHDfqnnwmZqgV55S6FUUcA

We ordered a couple ""box"" meals that come with 5 fingers, fries, slaw, toast and a drink for $6.99. The food came out hot and everything tasted pretty good. Chicken was moist and tender. They have a great sauce which is similar to Raising Cane's but in my opinion it's a tad spicier, which I like. Fries were hot and crispy, toast was good, a little soggy but good and the slaw was, well it's fast food slaw. For the price you get a decent amount of food. The fingers are a little on the small side but that's nothing unusual.

I'm giving Guthrie's two stars because the service was horrible and the restaurant was filthy. After ordering, we were never given drink cups. We get our food, still no drink cups. I go up to the counter and the girl behind it who was running both the counter and drive thru, completely ignores me. One of the cooks in the back asks what I need, tells her, I stand there for about 2 minutes and nothing. I decide to sit back down and wait, another 5 minutes go by, still no drink. I go up to the counter again, the same gentleman asks what I need, tells her yet again and they actually start a mini argument right in front of me about how busy she is and can't grab the drinks! The drive thru may have been busy but it was dead inside with only one other customer, who also did not get their drinks after they ordered. That's got to be fixed, it doesn't take but 30 seconds for her to grab a cup and ice.

The restaurant was also pretty dirty, all the tables were visibly greasy and had either salt or some sort of trash on them. With as slow as they seemed to be inside, I was surprised by this as other reviews mention their cleanliness. I'd eat Guthrie's again simply cause the food was decent and the price is great, but when I do go back, it will definitely be a drive thru visit only!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,2,0,2,6TPCKbxJ_7Ip1-sy3WLvvw

They serve golden chicken fingers and the Guthrie sauce is very similar to Raisin' Cane's except here its a little bit thicker. They have similar combo deals that come with fries, toast and coleslaw.

When I pulled up to the drive-thru, I could tell the person on the other end had a smile on their face. I appreciate that because it is so uncommon to have a pleasant person take your drive-thru order at fast food places. I noticed there was no one inside eating in the lobby so I assumed that a) my order will probably take a while since they'll have to make some fresh food or b) my food will come out quickly because it's been sitting around for a while and will taste not so fresh.

It turned out to be c) none of the above. The food came out right away and everything was hot and fresh. The chicken fingers are great by themselves but they do offer a variety of sauces like ranch and buffalo, along with their signature sauce. The toast was nice and warm with lots of butter on the toasted side. I like theirs better than Cane's. The fries were your standard crinkle-cut varietal and cole slaw was just that-- cole slaw. I never found cole slaw to be anything spectacular anyhow. I ordered an Arnold Palmer to drink and it was good, with a slightly floral taste to it. I think the lemonade might be made with honey, that might explain the ""something different"" taste. It was good and unique.

Like Jade says, this was the original, and Cane's is a knock off. 

Comparing the two; Guthries gives you more pieces for the money, but it's not as thick as Cane's.  Both give you crinkled fries, but Cane's seems to give you a little more with your portion. Toast at Cane's is better. Guthrie's cole slaw seems to be either better made or home made; it's better. 

I did like the service at Guthrie's, because I was served by one of the franchise owner's and he wanted to please. 

Guthrie's get's an extra star because they have a more varied menu, and consider healthier choices so you can bring people who are on diets or health conscious.

When I asked if they had kids meals he just replied back in a not so excited manner about the fact I could choose between the 5 piece box or the 3 piece box. We decided to go with two 5 piece boxes since it was two adults and two kids. The plate comes with the Strips,Fries, Coleslaw and a piece of texas toast. For the price I would say the food is alright. Personally the chicken almost didn't even look like white meat on some of the strips and the batter is very thin but it does have a nice flavor its just the tenders aren't all that juicy. The Cole Slaw tasted super gross but when walking back from the bathroom I noticed they had ""Kraft Coleslaw"" containers. It explained why I was not a fan as I hate Kraft Mayo lol so cole slaw isn't much different. Their signature sauce   to dip the strips in was a sauce almost close to a big mac type deal it had a very strong pickle taste to it for me. My  Mother did enjoy it on the other hand but i wasn't a fan. They charge about .36 for different sauces. We ended up having to purchase another ranch on our visit and we were helped  by Alex she was the reason this place got bumped up to 3 stars for me because she was friendly and attentive and seemed to actually care about our experience.  My daughter got one of the apple pies and it didn't come out with our order but once we let Alex know she was quick to correct the mistake and gave us a big smile!  Overall I still prefer Canes but if you are in the area and looking for some chicken this place is affordable and offers way less of a wait then canes!",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,0,0,3,g2MEEq_cPUSwXtBMBAhaFA

The food is almost identical but I think Gutheries coleslaw is better and I like that they season their fries.I always order a muddy water/Arnold Palmer at places that can make them and I think theirs here is rather good. The food was hot when I got home so it was indeed cooked to order, like they advertise.

I see some reviews say they have other sauces than the house sauce, but I did not see any on the menu? Either they took it off or I missed it somehow. That is definitely something that would make it better than Canes if they do - I get bored with not being able to get anything but the house sauce. 

I'll probably be back and see about those sauce choices. So far though, for fast food it's not bad since it's real food not boxed up and premade stuff.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,0,4,s7fkuk5VrFqJK56Oe78_Kg
