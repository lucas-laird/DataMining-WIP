Iggy worked with us to fully rebrand his truck for our client and worked with us to create a custom menu that coordinated with our client's product offering. They were so so easy to work with, Iggy made sure to keep us in the loop for many months leading up to CES and also helped us work out onsite logistics to insure his food truck could meet our menu offerings / attendees. The intense detail and high-quality offering - THESE WAFFLES ARE UNBELIEVABLE! - made the event exceed all expectations and we ended up breaking our goals thanks to Sticky Iggy! Such a PRO, such an excellent chef, so creative and all around just good good good people. Work with these guys if you can...and def find em so you can get at those waffles!!!!!!! Thanks, Iggy!",QdrZ-W3xDhaVPc_10fMO-g,1,0,5,vi26etK7FBv8feKG2GSsTQ

I just found hin at the food truck extravaganza,at on Fort Apache and Sunset that happens every Friday night from 5-11 trucks rotate. I had,chicken fingers dipped in waffle batter with ice cream drizzled with maple syrup. OMG those things should be illegal. They were amazing. If you like chicken and waffles you need to search out chef Iggy. You can find him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram",eopwxp9RUS1JCL2G_CSyGw,0,1,5,fvttBXW3r_n4R06Is7oXYw

      I'm not really one to eat vehicular based foods, but today was junk food lunch day and they were close by and it smelled so good and I was tricked!! 
      They were fast, my food was made to order and piping hot. The truck was clean, the girl who took my order was friendly and sweet. The man behind the fryer was friendly and nice. And my waffle chicken fingers and fries were SUPER GOOD. 
    Were they tasty? Yes. Do I regret eating them? Yes. Will I do it again? Yes, but it will be at a time when I can take a nap immediately afterwards.

4729125,2017-08-30,2,sgtF_x5ppBbIXRUE8XrmVg,"The food truck came to my workplace. I feel like they came unprepared. We waited in line for 15 - 20 minutes and still no one was there to take our orders. A few people just gave up and got cup of noodles from a vending machine instead. 

I really like chicken and waffles in general but their chicken and waffles are just okay. The butter is on the waffles so they got soggy pretty quick. The chicken was tender. It's definitely not worth waiting for 15-20 minutes plus to get the food. 

I would still prefer chicken and waffles from Skinny Fats to this place if I'm in vegas; otherwise, I would vote for roscoes in LA.",NXn0RBMGCkKN_lIy7vkmIw,2,2,3,8Tokp8lpYbCjY3M4swIE2A

The burgers, waffle dipped chicken, fries...delicious, quick and big servings!
