783142,2016-01-31,0,7gdpCYPKkQqfiWDoTQnHgQ,Omg there so good. Better then most sushi places I've eaten at. Especially better then Oyshi. There prices and amount they give u is great. They don't put a crazy amount of rice. I'm definitely coming back I'm so happy I gave this place a try :),plK-DZxoY7fyLAw__OaAOA,0,0,5,qO5h5HlFBaQbcoQdz1-o2w
981574,2017-08-06,0,7gdpCYPKkQqfiWDoTQnHgQ,"For $14 and change after tax, ordered the combo with kimbap, udon & tempura. Received a lettuce roll (pickle, carrot & lettuce rolled with rice in nori), one small shrimp and 5 small pieces of what imitated tempura, and an udon straight out of the package, powdered broth and all. 

I understand that they are trying to lower cost. However, having been in the restaurant business for more than a decade, serving people barely $3 worth of ingredients prepared half-way is no way to run a business. 

Learned my lesson, would rather drive further out in search for better quality food.",zHpEKlEAXQi-KFkDuzpuQw,1,0,1,WR_GN672lRs0YrL_Yr5oUw

1588570,2017-07-05,0,7gdpCYPKkQqfiWDoTQnHgQ,"Located inside Greenland supermarket, in the food court.
My review is purely for the sushi!
For the price, and a quick sushi craving, this is your place to go! I will admit, that the sushi is not the best. But you can't beat the price, which is now 6.99 a roll, its decent. You can select from a variety of rolls. Or you can do a combo meal.
Fish was a little dry, and the filling in the roll was a little too mushy for me. Rolls are covered with lots of sauce, so that may or may not be good for you. 
Service takes some time, but I don't think they have much staff as needed. So that didn't bother me too much.",AAUPbv9rhQs8LDeqGgWVCQ,1,0,3,99iQN9vq-Og5Yao5PRQbPg
1962845,2014-07-03,5,7gdpCYPKkQqfiWDoTQnHgQ,"Don't let the food court setting fool you, this place has got it goin' on.
A flat $6 for any roll on their menu- and this includes Vegas rolls, Hawaiian rolls, and about twelve other varieties. It's not a crazy-extensive menu, but it's definitely more than Cali, Philly, and shrimp tempura.

Fish is fresh, rolls aren't skimpy, presentation is on par with a stand-alone restaurant even when you order to-go, and the staff is super friendly to boot. They don't mind making tweaks or substitutions, either- I often add lemon, green onion, or garlic ponzu.

Just found my new place for getting takeout: 3 rolls under $20 AND I get to take my pants off and watch Netflix? Done.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,2,4,xBth0uyx49sGakb5YlZ7cw
2582782,2015-01-07,2,7gdpCYPKkQqfiWDoTQnHgQ,We went to eat this afternoon it's so disappointed. The service is bad and the food tasty is just ok. But the chefs they make order so slowly. It took us about 3 hour to wait and we didn't get the all orders what we made. We just ordered some nigiri sushi. But they couldn't even make it in 3 hours. We cancelled the order and left. So bad to try this restaurant never back.,d6RnAJXjEP_wpXmtAkjd9g,0,0,1,p4mxRAaz_moSQr-eXiKNBQ

The rolls are great fora quickpick up for the kiddies with their sushi cravings! The Haedupbap is awesome! It's a sashimi salad that come with a little rice underneath! Will always come back....

3029548,2016-07-03,0,7gdpCYPKkQqfiWDoTQnHgQ,"I was looking for the most normalist item in any of the 6 restaurants there and so I ordered this chicken bowl, with 4 sushi slices. When I saw the sizes of the bowls I was freaking out because I thought the portion was going to be YUDGE. The bowl was big but not the portion thank goodness. To my surprise the food was good. I was expecting a flavor of Yoshinoya/those healthy version bowl alternatives you see at those low budget restaurants. Nah. Not here. 

  Rice was the normal taste you'd get at a Chinese restaurant, chicken was pretty good. Tasted somewhat grilled and fully cooked. (Honestly after eating so much chicken throughout my life I got no idea how to describe it anymore). Broccoli good, carrots good. The sauce and the chicken made it all happen.

  A real surprise was the sushi. It was so fresh and when you bit into it, it would somewhat dissolve in your mouth. I got a sense of it freshly made and the cucumbers inside were fresh too. Whenever you slow down to taste your food you know its good. I was full at the end but wanted to order something else just because it was so good.

  Coming back here tomorrow to try the tempura. Hopefully with same results.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,0,1,4,tWoc96xfKZgZwhT7NVWLsw

Look, it's in the food court of Greenland Grocery. There's no atmosphere, and as I write this there's a mother off to my 3 o'clock trying to calm her screaming baby because she refuses to give up the ""babaa"".

But here's the thing: Does it taste like food court food? No.  Is it expensive? No. Is it worth coming back again despite the old lady at my 6 o'clock with a rustling bag full of live blue crab? Hell yes.",-W7E8KAhE_ssJgWY0RF-Ww,1,0,4,MUpTqZg-mHX1UvIeapJvgg

If your looking for this place it's tucked away right inside the Korean grocery store.  I loved the food.  I had the tempura cali roll and the medium spicy ramen (wasn't very spicy, which I liked).  Pretty good pricing.  They have some combos with a roll and ramen.  I just wish they offered an option to upgrade your roll with the ramen combo.  Totally fresh tasty food though.",xNmtM2u4KdeLu5R9jdRY7g,0,1,5,SvjhbQdz--JgZQoTxiNAUA

The most satisfying meals at unbeliever prices! My friend ordered sashimi topped rice salad (hwoidopbab) and i ordered crunch spicy tuna. The meals were quick, came with miso and marinated jalapenos. I enjoyed the fried rice noodle on top of my roll, completely filling me up. Less than $20 for all this food! Even in LA this would be a good deal.

They have a variety of rolls for $6.99 each and they are reasonably sized.  This is equivalent to sushi from Smith's BUT cheaper, bigger in size, and better options for combos.  Honestly, the rolls taste better than they look....  We've ordered to go from here twice and my favorites so far are the double shrimp roll and the baked salmon roll.
