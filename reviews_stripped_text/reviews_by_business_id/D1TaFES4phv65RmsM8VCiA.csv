My simple pizza, with only diced tomatoes and sausage was okay except that it tasted heavily salted. The pasta dish was not for me, with its ""bowl"" made of what could be thick crust of pizza dough. No way am I adding this to my diet. The enclosed macaroni with tomato sauce and chicken was good, but not worth the cost. Delivery was fast, employee polite and hunger satisfied.",i7jVRyOWCFuU577kg81hwg,1,1,4,A8Y_8tGWd5iWcKM-Z8Dn-w

I tried to order on the phone and the man continued to cut me off and never let me finish what i had to say as if i were a bother to him.

Maybe I'm bias because of the this particular Dominos pizza location. I ordered my pizza and it was delivered in 30 minutes. The drivers are super friendly and an overall good experience. 

I actually signed up on Yelp just to write a  good review on how nice they are. Will be ordering from here again.",wJC3ELZJ947UjSkya2BKVg,0,0,5,q1vx1QV3C8FVpTh27JIepg

The drivers get to the parking lot and make me walk out, they refuse to leave there cars and walk to the apartment.  If I meet them in the lot and say the money's in my home they get an attitude.

It took an hour and a half to get a medium 2 topping pizza and a small gluten free pizza. When it finally got here it was cold!! :( I watched the little tracker thing on my computer and according to it, it took 20 mins to ""prep"" only 8 minutes in the oven and 30 mins to ""quality check"" and the rest of the time to finally get to my door which means it was out of the oven longer than it was in there, how do they expect a pizza to stay hot?!. In the end, it was cold and not very good.",7BisIYyzB_0zreAZG5EzWg,0,0,1,8mQLQ-zu8fiUw1kXU7aUow

Pizza was cold, the driver not particularly polite, and they didn't bother to include the marinara cups that they charged EXTRA for to go with our stuffed cheesy bread. There was next to no cheese or toppings on the pizza. The stuffed cheesy bread was pretty good, or at least could have been if it had the marinara sauce. 

It's the first time I've ordered from Domino's in years, because the Handmade Pan looked good. It looks nothing the ads, which I know to expect. 

Still, it would have been nice if they could have gotten right.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,3,0,1,ZTtcNSwtg3kSxzi5qNk05A

While waiting I saw an employee (a driver I think but not sure) go over to the stand where the hot pizzas were waiting for pickup or delivery, and where nobody could see him.  He opened a pizza box, picked some pieces off the pizza and ate them!  Then he closed the box back up.  Gross, right?  That could have been my pizza, which was on the same stand.",KZ7ti7UP6_ffxzUrdfqDuA,0,0,1,yGCFHbyWWSuPamq3_nsuaQ
3834663,2018-03-08,0,D1TaFES4phv65RmsM8VCiA,Since the Del Webb location took over delivering to our area from the Durango location it SUCKS. We can watch them leave the store on the tracker and it always takes them over 30 minutes to get to our house so by the time the pizza comes it is always COLD. We only live 12 minutes from them we are further from Durango and they always had our pizza delivered in 15 minutes and still hot.

4036634,2016-03-23,0,D1TaFES4phv65RmsM8VCiA,I have been a long time customer of this location. Staff is always very friendly and pizza is always great. I don't know why but the past few months have been frustrating. Everytime they deliver they forget the dipping cups that they always charge extra for. I feel bad for sending them back to get them and in the meantime I have to wait while my pizza is getting cold. I called to remind them not to forget this time. So now we got the dipping cups but my pizza order was wrong. I was too frustrated to call and complain. Gonna be staying away from dominoes for a while. This is literally the fifth time in a row they messed something up.,1m6pTxgCEirb90uCTIl6CQ,0,0,2,bGiglyRI1ZDDHubA9Td8lg

Why you ask? WELLLL bc of their customer service of course! I decided one day after the gym I wanted a pizza, what kind you ask? The ONLY kind I LOVE! Buffalo chicken pizza! I swear, I love it with all mah heart! Soooo I call in and try to describe what toppings I want. The sweet little gentleman took the reigns and said he will make me a perfect pizza!

20 mins later I check out the pizza and it looks AMAZING! I get home and take a bite and almost die! SOOOOO GOOD!!! 

Go here for wonderful amazing customer service and pizza!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,2,4,Sc7oFC7s_aPYmOB0zS2yYQ

Just recently I put in an order and the boyfriend bit into their Sweet BBQ Bacon Chicken and was put off. Some of the pieces were almost raw.. which was strange because the outside sauce was sort of burnt on the chicken.

I called the store and the employee was so polite and had no problem replacing the chicken, although we decided to just go with plain with dipping sauces instead. Because of our issues, they made the order bigger and sent the driver out right away. They definitely have my returning business!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,0,0,4,K0qQnPcn1aW32itpxNEvqA

For fast food pizza, cheesesteak sandwiches and chicken nugget specialties, really pretty good compared to other fast food pizza franchises.  But, the last 2 times, ordered cheesesteak sandwiches and barely had any meat on the sandwich. I even called and not using the app so I could tell the person taking the order about the first incident of the sandwich.  If you use the app and order 10 times, you get a free pizza.  So, list out on that too. The onion and ham hand tossed pizza still good, the chicken nugget specialty with sweet Barbeque sauce was also good.
