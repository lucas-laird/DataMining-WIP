Their fries are not my favorite, the funnel cake is okay. I definitely only crave the cheese stick and their lemonade, always great. I do not like the flavors or the lite lemonade because of the sweetener after taste. If you like Diet Coke you won't notice, which is great because less sugar.",q2QekVEQKhNuvKMr_xr2qQ,0,0,4,_wjIg5YAkrTS1UquZAqfvw

When I was scanning the list of restaurants and stores at Town Square I was so excited to see that they had one! This is the perfect spot to grab a quick bite to eat in between shopping or before/after going to the movies. My boyfriend and I both got corn dogs (2 for $6) and their fabulous lemonade. We had to wait a bit since they make everything fresh, but that's the best part in my opinion. The corndogs were just as I remembered and the cashier that served us was very nice.",KQ9TbTOBwC5PTX0HXq1Tng,1,0,4,F7ZT8vtNEvuxWVNDdCfO3w
2880698,2018-05-22,4,OwG2nkJrDoP-WGcU9tvkUA,"Long ago, I used to be a loyal Hot Dog on A Stick employee. I don't frequent it as much as I used to, but nostalgia always brings me back! This particular location in Town Square captures all the good things about this staple mall food that I've always loved. One of the things this location has (that I'm not sure if others have) are great combo deals and discounts, so you can load up on all the delicious fried food, for much less. The funnel cake sticks here are well done, but there's a funnel cake place right next door too. 

Pro Tip: Park in the South parking structure for an easy walk to their outside stand.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,9,8,5,RVFRIwnAwKicKN33Qb8bXQ

Prices still very fair for this 40+ year old franchise. Always will be a customer for life!",mOmjzsYLVAoOza8GstYYhg,0,0,4,1ubClHL9SaQosG0UYdWu2w
3397418,2017-04-04,0,OwG2nkJrDoP-WGcU9tvkUA,"Loved the ice cold lemonade & cherry slush lemonade to wash down all the fried goodies. And who doesn't love hot dogs?! We tried the sampler that comes with 4 varieties of dogs of your choice - (Nathan's all beef, turkey, veggie, or a cheese dog- pepper jack, mozzarella or cheddar cheeses)  All are corn dog style. Also comes with an order of fries and funnel fries topped with powdered sugar. 

I was really surprised how yummy the veggie dog was, a lower calorie option and tasty, too! And you've got to try these funnel fries for dessert with a cherry slush lemonade- so good and perfect in this warm weather. Grab a seat under the umbrella seating right behind the kiosk - they deliver your meal right to you. I have to say, for fast food we had great service, and even got to try a sampler of their tasty cherry lemonade- which we of course had to have MORE OF! We'll be back again after our next shopping day.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,2,1,5,O5HFroapefXqRD05OrAoDA

They are always on top of things and for being new to Townsquare have already made a good impression on all the mall employees here and the customers!

3806436,2017-05-17,0,OwG2nkJrDoP-WGcU9tvkUA,"This place is such an American icon. Coming from Cali I just love this place. It's settled in the best outdoor mall in Vegas,Townsquare mall reminds me of being in SoCal. 
Came here with the family and had to have the corn dog and lemonade. Cherry is my favorite and the kids too. 
They have seating outside the kiosk so it was perfect to grab a quick bite. 
They even brought our food out to us which was a nice touch. Fast friendly service 
I say if you never had the best original American corndog and lemonade you've gotta stop here.",wbEgnipltXcc9oCGn0t-ng,2,1,5,3u_H8903Q6zza7_n0EcPcQ
4277026,2018-05-25,1,OwG2nkJrDoP-WGcU9tvkUA,"I love Hot Dog On A Stick. This was part of my childhood and early adulthood working at malls. They are made to order so you always get a hot and crunchy dog. And the lemonade is made fresh. I was super excited to finally visit because I had been craving this for about a month. The employee was super friendly and even gave me a sample of the frozen lemonade while I waited for my order. I like that they offer the 2 item deal for $6. The hot dog was everything I remembered; crunchy sweet batter with a juicy hot dog inside. The cheese stick I ordered was such a disappointment though. Two bites in, the cheese was not even melted all the way through. It was basically a warm cheese stick. I remember when I was younger, I had to wait to eat these because the cheese would burn my mouth. I was really sad because I was looking forward to this cheese stick. And when you are pregnant, and a craving isn't fulfilled, you are left highly upset. Hopefully this was just a one off. I'll still be back when I'm in Town Square to order another hot dog and lemonade.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,5,2,3,vhphoclJEdgzpN0XwTuzIg
