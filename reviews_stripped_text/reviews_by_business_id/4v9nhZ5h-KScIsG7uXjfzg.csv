871908,2017-11-09,1,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,Worst place ever. I come here because it's close to home but I'm getting ready to drive up a little further because I'm tired of this place. They always get my order wrong. The food is always cold. Sometimes the patties are burnt. There's even been a few times where my fries were still raw. They sometimes miss items in my order and when I say something they make it seem like we're just trying to get free food. Not coming here anymore. I've given this place to many chances. I'm done,pZTCtqStX8HBNTEK1XTyUQ,1,1,1,ZrQRNQK7I5wIJmMStWfM7w

Both times we left very frustrated.  The service at this store is absolutely horrible and the food took forever to be prepared.  Our group had to wait between 30 minutes to 1 hour for our food.  This is unacceptable when kids need to eat real quick and head back to the field. Not only were the staff incompetent, the manager on site was not apologetic nor did it even faze them that they should stop current orders and expedite orders that have been placed an hour ago.

It was utter chaos in this store and we will definitely not go back.  We'll make sure to stop at the location right off the freeway next time!",Gp3xBhgbRQbJOWJB3iiJeQ,1,1,1,hGRsrG7RWYYEoHzx5ikInA
1357550,2018-03-19,1,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"Well out of pure desperation since my stove wasn't gonna see a pot today I decided to stop here. It went as expected fir McDonald's!!! Young lady that took my order was pleasant although it seemed as she was screaming at me repeating my order. I'm gonna say this again SHE REPEATED MY ORDER!!!! So I get to the window to pick up my order and of course nothing is as I requested.

I like to get a small order of fries for the older homeless lady and get those put in a separate bag. I don't know her but if I see her I always feed her because my heart goes out to her. So they put my order and the extra order of fries in the same bag. Dummies there's a reason why I requested it that way.

So then I asked for a strawberry sprite and guess what I got??? A regular sprite!!!!  Why is it so hard for their employees to fawk up 90% of their customer's orders??? It's not like they're doing 2 things at once right!!! You have one doing nothing but take the orders and the money. And a complete second window for the orders!!!! How hard does this have to continue to be??? I know McDonald's don't care about the service they give their customers but damn  enough is enough!!!! 

How does Chick Fil A and In N Out nail it each and everytime??? They care about providing great service to their customers. But these same individuals want to earn $15 per hour but can't follow instructions when taking your order. Anyone who can't follow simple directions needs to continue to earn minimum wage until they show they're worth a raise!!!",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,0,1,K-uiTPiIDz6Dt9hg_OO7ug
1762662,2017-12-20,0,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"I've been going here for the past two years (walking distance from my house) and they've always been clean, and today I walked in and they're VERY up to date! They have 4 different ways you can order. You can either order food on their mc Donald's app- and you can pick up in the store, outside, or in the drive thru. You can go inside and they have four order stations, so instead of waiting inline you can order your food, grab a number and sit at your table and the food will be brought to you! The usual ordering at the counter, and of course the double drive thru window! 

It was VERY clean, the cleanest mc Donald's I've seen that's for sure. Fast service, and the play area has been upgraded; not too big but not to small, with only one way in and out of the jungle gym. Which is great for paranoid mothers like me who are constantly worried about your child running out and you didn't see them get out of the gym. You can keep an eye on one entry way! Which is great!!!! I recommend this McDonald's!!",FiUJ8B7EYaTyWWNg2431rw,0,0,5,Z8k6Hwjk9qfD3b9g_fugDA
1990948,2017-12-04,1,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"After a long day of shopping my kids were super hungry, we stopped at McDonald's before we went home. You can see the time where we payed on the receipt, and the time where we made it to the second window to pick up our food are 7 minutes apart. That was okay, but then we were additionally asked to park. We asked why were we being parked when there was already 3 cars parked in front of us as you can see on the pictures I uploaded. The girl said that they had to get to the orders with less food first.  And that if I did not like it, to give her my debit card back so I can get a refund, even though I didn't ask for a refund. I gave her my card and she refunded me incorrectly as you can see on the receipt. I asked her to put her name on the back of the receipt so I could call corporate. She said okay and did not seem to care. She was the manager at the moment her name is Felicia. 
Thanks Felicia, we enjoy Jack in the Box, they were happy to take care of us",WnpAikOl1iVF1arSeivJZQ,1,1,1,40IzpFZg_j9JvkwMr-mPrg

2580406,2016-11-27,1,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"Came in at this location for a quick breakfast bite before going to Lake Mead Recreational Park. I honestly couldn't believe their service here. I lost count on how many orders they had messed up in the 8 minutes I was standing at the counter to receive my order. I was surprised they didn't messed up my order, but the wait time for two sausage mcmuffins was unbelievable.
Would not recommend this location to anyone.",c2oqmbh9iyQAswuIvmSkzQ,2,0,1,yqpV6qV3jBQcRs40S_UjVQ

4722722,2015-11-12,0,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,A month ago I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich from this restaurant and it had dirt wrapped in with it. I haven't been back since. The sandwich smelled just like fish. How is it possible that a chicken sandwich could end up smelling like fish? I complained to the manager and she didn't show any sympathy whatsoever.  She made no apologies at all.  I was deeply disturbed and highly offended by her lack of customer service skills.  They then took another half hour to make a new sandwich. It was the worst experience at McDonald's in my life.,Dpp0gEmuNTnvyPAdrDu2Bw,0,0,1,-rLixvBhMroOI1TanNEeJg
4929834,2015-10-14,2,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"McDonald's generally sucks anyway, but the service here is especially incompetent. I'm always astounded by the line of cars at the drive thru who seem perfectly content to sit and wait for some garbage to stuff down their gullets when it would take less time to cook something good at home.",vqZCDJ8RpOU6nPJhUWi2jw,1,1,2,T0pxPicP4wyt4qe_-L6p4Q
5005308,2017-11-24,0,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"Honestly I try to give the benefit of the doubt every time, but when every single time I come here (close to home) and HOPE things are better and they aren't I am really disappointed.  The staff (not all) has been rude or doesn't care, tonight I took an order, mind you I was the only person there in the drive thru and when I got to the window the girl had no clue what I ordered ""sorry we were all laughing what did you want?"" (This isn't the first, or second or third time the staff had little care for customer service).  I sadly say that with fries being ice cold (even though I've got to the point to ask for no salt bc I want fresh fries or have asked for fresh fries) I always get cold food and went to the window and asked for my drink (which I ordered) the girl had no clue and spent time laughing with her coworkers and finally gave me my drink.  I've come to the point where I'd rather travel s couple miles somewhere else to get some food...",AlhKf86Mw9ZTd21XrOrF-w,0,0,1,4WYLoblyNohZBvw4O0gxdw
5420675,2016-11-25,0,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,This place is lousy! The staff are not clean. This young white guy had something yucky on his finger and I wanted to puke! They cannot make the Frappe well; too thick and too icy! The food is never hot! The clerks at the drive thru act like they are not concerned.

It's consistently bad, mostly with the wait in the drive thru. Literally can never count on stopping before work because they will make me late. I don't think I've ever waited less than 15 minutes here.
The food I usually don't have a problem with.. until now. The fries are soggy and undercooked. My chicken tenders were literally smaller than my pinky. Like I ordered small chicken fingers. Oh and 3 were burnt and 1 wasn't even cooked.
I don't understand how this place is so poorly managed. I even put in my resume and applied to be manager because it's so, so bad, just go to the jack in the box across the street.",MpfC9FUP7lLw2pwU3oSuyA,2,1,1,GZtC7gtKmsBRm_1LNLCZnQ

Only about 3/4 of the cup is filled. Today, I finally asked the worker why they do not fill the cup to the top as it should be, and she responded in a very rude manner. She merely said that's how their machines work and did not try to fix my issue. I am very angry as I am paying for a product and not receiving the full amount.

5907978,2018-07-02,0,4v9nhZ5h-KScIsG7uXjfzg,"I've been very busy lately, and unfortunately been eating fast food, namely McDonald's. I was there last week twice and not experiences through the drive through were bad. I also was there today and the worst experience thus far. 

Experience 1: I ordered my food, two cars in spots 1&2 and one car behind me. I was asked to park in spot 4(there is no parking area #3, I guess counting it's a must to work and manage McDonalds). I go around the cars parked at 1&2 to park in spot 4 with a full size pickup truck, there is concrete that sticks out and make it difficult to park there as I had to reverse and almost get hit by car leaving stall #1. I go and wait 14 min from the time I paid for my order only to have an employee ask some random person in a car if my order was there's; I flag them down and get my food. There was 1 car behind me. 


Experience 2: I Order my food then I am asked to park in stall #1, multiple cars leave behind me, no 1 or 2. But 5 in total with bags of food. I finally get my food 20 min later. 20 minutes, for ""fast food"". I am not happy the employees are clearly working on getting simpler items out rather than working on there longest ticket times, with larger tickets being pushed to the back. When I say larger I mean 2 meal orders.

Experience 3: I order my food, two cars are in spots 1 and 2. I ""roll up"" my window because it's 109*F and I'm in the process of talking to get my air conditioner back on (it broke and I need to have it fixed ASAP as I take care of my elderly mother, heat can kill). I look up and notice the manager woman at the window she asks me to park in #4 I explain to her that it's to tight of a turn and I really cannot be waiting 20 min for two orders today. She tells me ""well you need to move so I can get other cars through my drive through and that I will not be waiting 20 min today"" with a snarky attitude. Car #1 leaves and she tells an employee "" go tell that car to move up"" and looks at me and says "" there you can move up"" and motions me to do so. I then say you missing the point I will not be moving to park. She tells me "" your food isn't ready"" and tell her ""that's okay I'll wait right here"". She has been rolling her eyes the entire time and shuts the window (harder than I've heard it before). From start to finish I have my food in 8minutes, by holding up the line to force the manager and employees to move food by ticket time rather than let them push off cars, to sit for 20min (a sit down restaurant ticket time). I drive up and ask car now at number 1 how long they have been waiting since they were not the car in front of me or the car in front of that car, and they still did not have there food. They tell me it has been 18min, and if they don't get there food in two minutes they will go inside to complain. 


Lately this McDonald's has had longer wait times regardless of a line or not- it seems that this is how the manager manages their staff, and seeing all the other yelp reviews it's not positive.",C6LJPTxe_U2HUZtUstnuGg,0,0,1,-1MwXLRpkQZ8ggWcDwxYng
