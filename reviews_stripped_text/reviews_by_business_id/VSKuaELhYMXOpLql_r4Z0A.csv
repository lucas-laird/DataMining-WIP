The outside of the restaurant looks dead as there is no furniture. Very un-inviting.  Really looks like they were not ready to open to be quite honest.  Why do restaurant do this to themselves.

I looked around and it seems like there is supposed to be a hostess but just empty dining room.

I work in the LINQ so after I ordered my 2 pastrami sandwiches and drinks for over $40 dollars I did want to get my discount.  The cashier had to leave the front counter to find a manager to give me my discount so this took a while.  With hardly no one in line it seems like it was so difficult for what should be a simple transaction.  

With so many other good options that are more reasonably priced the is not the place to go.  They also do not have any TV's anywhere so if I wasn't at work I would like to be able to see some of the playoff games but they don't have that either.  Oh yeah they also don't have any restrooms!!!  Seriously guys.  Wow.  Lots and lots of work to do if you have any chance of remaining competitive.

I was torn between the brisket and pastrami sandwich, so the waitress (Kelly/Kellie I think) brought us a small sample of each.  And wow am I glad she did.  I was leaning towards the brisket, but their pastrami...  Oh, MOMMY!  So moist.  So tender.  So tasty.  So want some more of that.  I ordered that, ""on anything other than rye please"" (doesn't agree with me).  We also ordered some appetizer, Fries topped with pastrami I think it was.

The appetizer was great - of course because it had that amazing pastrami on it.  But my sandwich...  She put it on on a kaiser roll that was super soft, and it was absolutely loaded with pastrami.  By far one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long, long time.  I was only able to eat half (the appetizer was big), so hauled the other half back home on the plane with me and had it (it was almost just as good) the next day.  

I got a glimpse of their breakfast menu, and if I stay near there again in the future, will definitely be stopping by for a) breakfast and b) more of that awesome pastrami.  Loved this place.",eTtIpBCxxMkqAcDz3HQKEg,0,0,5,HAeC4U32wmyVy8TkzWI03w

Rather than boring you with the details, let's just say that the kitchen can be VERY slow and simple requests like dressing on the side are not followed. The ""famous"" pastrami was way too fatty and pretty small. The restaurant blamed the kitchen. This may be true, but as customers we just want decent food served promptly to the table, especially if we are spending over $40 for a 1/2 sandwich, soup, salad and soft drinks.

The pastrami sandwich was a huge disappointment. They call themselves a classic, however the pastrami is only a classic if you call frozen boil in the bag meat found in your grocery store classic.

I couldn't have been more disappointed in my experience here which is hard for me because ordinarily I feel you can't go wrong with breakfast. I ordered pancakess & bacon.....simple right?? WRONG....the pancakes are tough and rubbery and the bacon grossly undercooked. I also requested a juice blend (orange & cranberry). My companion ordered a bialy.  We arrived at 9:30, ordered at 9:38, at 9:58 we are still without food and the place was NOT crowded. Yet 2 tables Sat after us received their meals and according to our server eggs and hash browns take less time to make than pancakes.  My question is WHERE???  MY companion had to leave at 10 and still hadn't received her bialy only to be told they didn't have any today. 20 min to find out they don't have what you ordered. UNACCEPTABLE. At 10 we were told they'd send a manager over. 20 min later a manager arrives....takes food away, offers to remake (I've been here nearly an hour NO THANKS).  So now with ALL the Food removed they bring me the bill. $11.26 FOR 2 JUICES. He neglected to tell me that the cranberry juice was in a can so that cost would be in addition to the price of the orange juice which was $3.90 and brought to us on 3/4 full 12 oz. cups. The 4oz can of cranberry juice $2.50. I have never had such horrible service!!  I would never patron here again!!",FYtlLQ4JtDaeRR1W0iO-pQ,1,0,1,kXsRpEjNFvlHEAISzC6wvQ
1666995,2018-03-15,3,VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A,"Move along... move along...  nothing to see here...

Canter's was a must try but ultimately was nothing special.  Place was pretty much empty which was an immediate red flag.  

They did give us some samples of their meat at the counter which was tasty but not mind blowing.  

I chose to go with their breakfast ""served all day.""  Bacon and 3 eggs, hash browns and a toasted bagel.  Meh... it was a simple breakfast and again nothing special.

The most disappointing part was when I checked in on Yelp...  they had an offer for two free ""black and white"" cookies, whatever those are.  So I hit ""use now"" and it said to inform their staff and show them the offer which I did.  Unfortunately, they were all out, so I said no worries what  else can you offer us instead?  The response was - nothing.  

Uh ooohhhh... not a good answer considering they had a case full of pastries up front.  I'm sure the manager coulda thought of something to appease us but noooooooo...  

Whatever... 

My buddies all had the pastrami sandwiches which they said were ok but a bit chewy.  We also had some Chili fries and onion rings to start.  Rings were ok but not sure if ground beef with a few beans scattered around held together with melted cheese and topped with onions actually constitutes ""chili fries""... bleh totally tasteless.

Service was good.  Our server did a great job keeping our drinks topped off and did her best to make up for the ""cookie debacle.""

1843464,2018-03-25,1,VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A,"Ok, it's hard to rate the worst dining experience that I have ever had without actually eating but here goes.  Arrived at Canter's at 11:45am and requested a table for two.  Told 20 minutes.  Ok.  2- minutes later called for our table.  Seated outside and noticed a number of empty tables, some with place settings but no diners.  Strange?  After not being greeted at all by a server a server showed up at the table next to us that was seated 10 minutes earlier.  He explained that he didn't know he had any outside tables.  After taking their drink orders he proclaimed that he would be ""back with their drink orders when he could"".  Uh oh.  Another 10 minutes goes by and no server.  The couple behind us gets irritated and leaves, no server.  They pass by a couple of ladies seated to our left and exchanged stories about the lack of service.  One lady goes inside to see what is going on.  Mean while I stop one of the greeters who has now seated yet another couple, ironically at the table where the people just walked out.  I tell him we haven't seen a server, he mumbles something about seeing what is going on and goes inside.  We wait another 10 minutes and decide to leave.  On my way out I tell the young ladies at their stand about not seeing a server.  They slightly apologize but knew what was, or wasn't going on.  Not their fault.

This is a breakdown of the highest order. A lack of managerial skills with the blame to be squarely placed at the feet of the owner, manager, and shift manager.  If Canter's in L.A. have just leased out their name to these people, they need to be careful about their brand, these people are ruining it.

By the was, we left Canter's and walked down to Virgil's Real BBQ, it was amazing.  Seated immediately and greeted by our server within 2 minutes, and it was crowded too!!

The photo I am sharing shows the empty tables outside right before we left.  Empty tables but still a 20 minute wait and a lot of people waiting for a table.

We were initially hesitant to visit because of the number of negative reviews but as business owners ourselves my husband and are always aware of how hard it is to run a business and feel most places need a chance. When we walk up the place was almost empty, a bit worrisome but we decided to give it a chance. The young lady who initially greeted us was friendly and smiling. However, when she asked one of her female teammates to seat us outside the young lady charged with the task seemed incredibly put out and in addition to the eye roll we are pretty sure that we heard a sigh. She, without any enthusiasm proceeded to lead us into the inside dining room. When asked to please be seated outside, she obliged and graced us with more eye rolls and sighs. When we asked if we could take the table in the sun rather than shade we thought for sure she was going to lose it. This one small statures young lady could in our opinion lead to the restaurants closing. She needs to not work around people. 

On a positive note... Q, our server was awesome. He deserves the biggest kudos for his customer service, attentiveness, positive attitude and humor. He watched over and took care of us ensuring that even though our wait for our sandwiches was unreasonably long that he made us as comfortable as possible. I would hire him in a heartbeat and he is a true asset. 

The food, I had the Rachel and my husband had the Pastrami. Both sandwiches were good size, smaller than I remember from the other Canter's but still more then I could finish. Meat was plentiful, juicy and tasty, potato salad not so much. Portion size was okay but it had 0 flavor. 

We would probably come back because of Q's hospitality and the meat  but might turn away and change our mind  if the unpleasant young lady is the one greeting guests.

We made plans to have a group lunch the Wednesday after opening. After a crazy morning, those plans changed to placing a group to-go order, which one of our team members graciously took on. 

Unfortunately, despite having a very clear list of everyone's choices, our team member came back to the office over an hour after leaving to find that several of the orders were wrong. 

- a diet soda was missing 
- crispy chicken sandwiches were replaced by grilled chicken sandwiches
- reuben sandwiches were replaced by just pastrami or corned beef 
- a salad that was ordered was not placed in the bag 
- a few other things I can't remember since I didn't run the order

In addition, the dessert menu was not yet fully up and running. Our team member ordered what she could based on what was available. However, we were disappointed to find that a number of dessert choices were outsourced from Freed's.

Other than the service/flow issues, the food was great. Latkes were crisp and delicious. Pastrami and corned beef were juicy and tender. Bread was fresh. Matzoh ball soup was savory and deep.

Was seated fairly quickly and eventually got our drink order taken after waiting and noticing other tables in various stages of frustration.  

That was our server's first and only appearance to the table.  The remainder of our meal was spent trying to get the attention of any staff that would return eye contact for the other things we needed for our meal...Minor details, like:

-Silverware (none on table, none brought with food, told food runner we needed but had to ask another staff member for)

Napkins (noticed I couldn't see napkins at any table).  If anyone can eat a Reuben sandwich without needing a pile of napkins, I salute you.

Beverage refills.  -No one walking through restaurant with a carafe of coffee refilling cups.  This was breakfast time.  

Some type of spread for the bagel that was served dry.  No butter, jelly, anything...although they informed us they could bring cream cheese for an additional charge.

No one asked us if our food was ok, if we wanted another cup of coffee with our meal or if we were just content staring at cups that were completely dry.  I started to get the feeling that I had somehow become invisible.

I lived a block from the Canter's on Fairfax for years and was really looking forward to this place opening. I started with a matzo ball soup. The soup was murky and salty. The matzo balls were way too soft. It was not very good at all. I also ordered a grilled corned beef reuben sandwich. The sandwich that was brought to me looked carelessly slapped together with 1000 island sauce smeared over about a third of the top. The exposed bread had no coloring and  was soft and cool to the touch. I told the waitress that it was supposed to be grilled. She agreed and the busser took the sandwich back to the kitchen. He returned immediately with the same sandwich and no change had been made. He told me that the cook said that it was grilled and that if I wanted it toasted, that is something different. This is B.S. I know what a grilled sandwich is and what one should look like. Certainly, a grilled sandwich should not be pale, cool and soft. I rejected the sandwich and asked for the manager. When the manager came, she seemed like I was just a waste of her time and she told me that she didn't have a chance to look at my sandwich and that they do things a bit different than in L.A. (Funny, the entire back wall is photos of the L.A. location.) I told her that I was pissed and my intelligence insulted that the cook would insist that what was brought to me was grilled. I've had enough grilled cheese or ruben sandwiches over that last 5 decades to know what grilled should be.

I wanted to be sure as we like to try new places but even though the menu was smaller than LA, I ordered a Build your own omelette with corned beef, onions and swiss cheese with crispy hashed browns per the menu but not as crispy as I really like them. I have to say the eggs, which had the swiss cheese melted on top were really good and even though I watch my sodium, I had eaten carefully in our condo earlier in the day. I am on a gluten free diet but had to have some bites of a bagel. No pumpernickle was baked that day but the plain one was huge and toasted just right and they gave me a side of cream cheese to make up for no pumpernickle. I took a ""gluten blocker"" even though they are from vitamin stores and not everyone believes they work but those bites of bagel with the cream cheese and some eggs on bagel too were good and it was too much food so I had breakfast for the am. My husband ordered salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes. The sides were cool and it was cold inside there so we understod why people were eating outside but people line up for the observation wheel right there so we opted for indoors. Since his sides were cool but salmon hot, they must have plated sides too early.

4021912,2018-02-06,5,VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A,"So I am very detailed in my reviews and i cannot be any more upset with my experience. I went the first time because I had always wanted to go because of the name etc... So we go the first time and I thought its new here let there be some mistakes its not that big of a deal. WRONG !! Firstly... the only good thing was the really nice server SINA who is just a nice guy trying to do his job. The food was horrible we ordered the franklins the picture looked great and the food came out dry and felt like it was a day old and it took so long to come out I thought we were in miami for a minute. We still ate and went on with it. Sina was at least night. We are rewards cards member so we asked about the program and if we earn points ( apparently we do not) but the apparent Manager on duty who was extremely proud of his canters locations said ""oh you are rewards members.. you dont earn points but we give a 15% discount"". I thought that was great since the food was horrendous anyways.

I thought lets give this place another chance. The place is empty for a reason. Its overpriced horrendous quality and terrible service. So we go back ( i literally just left and i believe in second chances) My partner asks about the prime rib that is advertised on their flyer (false advertising) apparently the prime rib is not available at the linq location.. so then in my opinion i would probably take it off the flyer in the middle of our table or have it be a conversation piece. Secondly, our server didnt know anything about the menu items or whats in them or how to describe them. Thirdly, my partner wanted corned beef ( its a deli is that not something they know they are known for) They said they didnt have corned beef they sold out ( lies ive been here over a week there was no long lineup and them selling out of corned beef) This isnt even the biggest issue. My partner ordered pastrami instead. The food ONCE AGAIN was horrible it took 30 minutes for soup and sandwich to come out ? Really ? That is just bad buisness and our server didnt check on us once to say sorry the deli meat and pre made soup you ordered is taking long (insert sarcasm here).

So we were ready to go it took forever to get the bill. We mentioned we were rewards members and to get the 15% discount (because had it not been brought to our attention the first time we would not have known) They said sorry theres no discount ( we have the reciept so we are going to go back just to make sure they know that they are giving out wrong information) They didnt honour the discount the manager ESTHER is the worst manger ever YOU WOULD THINK that you would want to see how you can make your customers experience better if they are unsatisfied.

We did not try to get free items. we did not complain about the chewy gross pastrami. We did not complain that they advertised items they didnt carry. We did not complain that it took 30 minutes to get our food. We didnt even ask for the manager just the bill we wanted to get out of this place as fast as possible. Then Esther comes by ... SHE SAYS they dont do the discount my partner proceeds to tell her that we were here the other day and we got the discount from the manager which she proceeds to say "" i am the manager"" ( ok tonight you are the manager but you dont work 24/7 and if you are the manager you are not doing a good job of it) My partner states it was a male manager and he was the one who gave the discount. He also states that he just wants to leave and that we wont be back. Esther was basically didnt give a crap that we were unhappy. My partner stated he didnt want a discount and that he wanted to let her know some of the things he was unhappy with for next time. She just kept saying ""ok if you want to go go"" She had zero care in the world if we were happy or not. We live in las vegas and in toronto they had no idea that we were not just tourists and you would think if i was a tourist you would want my buisness.

Then.. as we get up to go I see Sina our server from the other night. My partner says hey do you remember us he says of course i remember you guys ( he genuinely did im kind of hard to miss) and he says remember the discount and i think the manager on that day was MIKEY ( ill be seeing him) he said yes let me go ask for you guys.. we knew that was gonna go nowhere ( not his fault) because we had already spoken to that poor excuse for a manager who just walked away from our table while we were still speaking. Esther should be ashamed of herself and if you are allowing her to be the manager in your restaurant you need to think twice. Sina took our rewards card and genuinely went back to ask and he came out poor guy stating he just got yelled at in the back by ESTHER the manager. Sina is just doing his job trying to earn a living and make the restaurant great and the manager is yelling at him for asking about the rewards points. Its really disturbing that he would get treated like that. She must have grabbed our rewards ca",vQeOZghlFqB-DdbD9D5qhw,4,0,1,Bw8reI0Xz0U_Ed5GKb17CA

Long story short, it's not as good as the one in L.A. due to its higher prices and smaller servings. Thankfully, the pastrami on rye tasted just as delicious as it did back home. If there's a better pastrami sandwich in Vegas, I'd love to try it. 

Our waiter Jay was funny and seemed genuinely concerned with our experience. One bummer, though: the pickles that come out immediately as an appetizer in L.A. were nowhere to be found in Vegas. I asked one of the other workers for them and he forgot. When I brought it to the attention of Jay, he made sure that a plate full of them was delivered ASAP.

My family of 4 ate here on a whim when we saw it walking down the street.  We ordered the open roast beef sandwhich and meatloaf sandwhich both which came with mashed potatoes and onion straws.  Gravy covered the potatoes and sandwhich.  My little one had the kids cheeseburgers with fries.

The kid's meal was plentiful and came with a drink.  All for $5.95.  Not a bad deal for Vegas Prices.  Being a self proclaimed cheeseburger connoisseur, my little one said the burgers were quite tasty.

I myself make a damn good roast beef sandwhich and gravy that would rival that of any gourmet restaurant, found this sandwhich to be a good substitution, meat tender along with flavorful gravy.  Onion straws were great.  The mashed potatoes had a strange after taste that made me leave them behind on an otherwise clean plate. 

My wife had the meatloaf sandwich.  The portion was huge.  She enjoyed the meal immensely.  The cost for both the roast beef and meatloaf was $15 each.  Again a deal for such a large flavorful meal in Vegas.   

I brought the mashed potatoe taste up to the waiter.  The waiter tried the potatoes and agreed they tasted weird and not normal, yet nothing was offered.  Just a free dessert would have been enough compensation for 3 diners with a portion which was inedible.   

The service was a little slow, even though they were not busy.  I had to get up twice to refill my own drink.  But they were friendly.

I miss the New York delis. I had looked forward to Canter's coming to Summerlin. As it turned out, the place is infested with astronomical prices and infinestimal service. My brother was so disgusted by his $20 pastrami sandwich plus $3 for a side dish that he wrote his second Yelp review.

I knew that Canter's was opening a second Las Vegas location on the Strip. In the front of my mind I knew that if a pastrami sandwich is close to $20 in Summerlin, it would be off the charts expensive on the Las Vegas Strip. When all is said and done, I wasn't chomping at the bit for this Canter's to open.

Throughout this week we'd pass through the Linq between the Orleans shuttle stop and the Strip. Near the High Roller on an empty storefront door there was a small sign saying that Canter's is Coming Soon. I was surprised when I was walking in the Linq when my olfactory senses alerted me to Canter's. Only a few hours ago, it was an empty storefront. Canter's had just opened a couple of hours ago. Expecting price shock I asked if there was a take out menu. The friendly lady said they had been open about an hour and that I can take pictures of the menu. I did just that, then outside the Linq evaluated the choices. Astonishingly a pastrami sandwich on the Strip is a few dollars less than the exact one in Summerlin. And astonishingly, this deli does not offer the very popular deli staple: kosher. However, they do offer an egg salad sandwich, which is not too common in Las Vegas. So, I followed my olfactory senses back to the aroma of deli food. Disparite from the majority of the menu, the price for the egg salad sandwich is fair. The egg salad sandwich with the choice of bread (including a bagel) and two sides is $9.25 and a bottomless plastic cup of a Coke product is $3.

The same friendly employee that greeted me a few minutes previous nicely told me to seat myself. In this large room filled with Canter pictures and a new restaurant scent, I sat myself then waited and waited and waited. I'd even change my seat to the center of this uncrowded newly opened deli. Finally a server asked me what I wanted to drink. A Coke ($3).He'd place the drink on the table then the service disappeared. It seemed that I likewise disappeared. Servers just passed me by. Service was nonexistent. I'd see the staff standing at the entrance of the kitchen. I'd even see a manager seated at a table across from me that failed to acknowledge me. Then there was an employee sweeping that failed to acknowledge me. Nobody offered me a menu, although I assume that I was supposed to take one when I served myself. After approximately twenty minutes of being the invisible man, I preferred to be a visible man and exchange my hard earned money with a waitstaff that acknowledges me.

On its first day of opening, Canter's does not have a bug to fix. Just common sense! If somebody is seated for twenty minutes without a menu, there is a good chance that he might want somebody to acknowledge him and place a menu on the table so that he could order something. Possibly even a $17 pastrami sandwich. Canter's needs to offer more deli food that reflects on their original location. This includes Kashe. Finally Canter's needs to rethink their pricing strategy.

....................
Reviewer's note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 optimistic that the Management team will read this review and fix the issues discussed in this review. Las Vegas has a shortage of delis. If Canter's Management addresses these drawbacks it has the potential to provide a much needed good deli in the Las Vegas market.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,8,2,PKL3tKGoLnvCnEuLMeiULw

I ordered the corned beef hash, with scrambled eggs , hash browns and English muffin. When the food came my eggs were scrambled with a piece of American cheese on top. I switched my eggs with a friend who actually ordered scrambled with cheese and his were plain. The corned beef hash was lack luster. I can't even describe the flavor or lack thereof. The only thing good on the plate was the english muffin (which really isn't saying much being it was burnt). One of my friends ordered steak and eggs and the steak came out looking like a hockey puck and it was tough. He told the waiter and the waiter said he would have the chef make a new one...well 20 mins later and still no steak. He brought us the bill and we had to ask that the steak be wrapped up. For the inconvenience he gave us a blueberry muffin and chocolate muffin. Well this morning we were going to have our muffins and after cutting it to share it with each other, we noticed the blueberries were at the bottom of the muffin and to add insult to injury, the muffin was molded !!!

Food was good. We had matzoh ball soup and half sandwich, David had a corned beef reuben with potato salad, and a Rachel with brisket and macaroni salad. No complaints at all about our food. We liked that you could get a reuben or almost any other sandwich as your half sandwich - at the venerable Sherman's in Palm Springs, you can only get plain meat sandwiches with the combo.

Service was another matter. We weren't given napkins or cutlery. The soup came with a spoon so we used that for our salads, but when we asked for napkins it took several minutes (?) to get them. There was only a yellow mustard container on the table. David asked for deli mustard, our server said the container was all they had. She explained they had only been open for 5 weeks. It showed. David discovered the yellow container actually had brown mustard in it, so that was ok. Our soup and sandwich were served at the same time. At other places the soup comes out first, which is nicer. Also the soup portion was a bit small, though the sandwich was generous. 

The next table (there were only 5-6 tables occupied as it was around 10 PM) waited agonizingly long to get their bill and to pay. We got our bill pretty quickly and paid cash so we didn't have to wait.

The Pastrami is fantastic, we have ordered from the Canter's in Tivoli Village many times and their service and food is exemplary. I don't know if it the same franchisee operates this location or not, but Canter's at the Linq promenade was a terrible experience. The service was the WORST I have ever experienced in Las Vegas, and in this town, that is saying something. Obviously I am not alone in my
opinion of their lackluster service, as evidenced by the reviews of others. Perhaps the management should take some interest in the reasons for the slow, unprofessional service one receives when visiting this establishment. The rent in this location must be expensive, but with service like theirs, I'm sure it won't be an issue much longer.

Classic Jewish diner with all the fixin's. Canters has a special place in my heart after many adventures to the LA establishment and I only recently discovered the hidden promenade in Vegas which features an ""as authentic as the original"" iteration of the diner. Unfortunately I didn't notice whether they duplicated their fantastic bakery but I'll save that for a future visit. 

Love this greasy spoon kinda food on the fly. I had a burger, bunless- I believe it was the Canters burger- no cheese & comes with Russian dressing. It was perfect- a thinner patty but served as requested with a side salad. My husband had the corn beef hash & eggs, a staple that you can't go wrong with at a diner. Their selection of omelettes looked mouthwateringly good.  

Service was fast, place was new & spic/span. Think booths and high tops- that's what you'll find here although there is also an outside area which offers misters to keep cool. 

The people here really got me. They were down to earth & friendly. It made it feel even more authentic like the original family run business. I'm glad they're keeping to their values. As a patron it comes through & by comparison to breakfast at iHop on the strip - we'll take this over that any day of the week. It's a night & day difference in service and attention.

First the hostess wasn't there and we went inside to ask about the seating because more poeple were lining up behind us, some girl said .""oh she is probably busy go stand outside and wait!"" So we did for 5 more mins. We asked for a seat outside and it was about 10:30 so here in Vegas the sun is pretty strong and I wanted a table under the shade so the hostess said ,"" No u have to sit on this one!"" The sun was directly on it so a waiter opens some shades and starts taking our order. 40 minutes later he comes back and tells us ,""funny story I forgot to put in your order!!"" How is that funny??? We have been sitting there waisting our time!! We got up and left and as we were walking away we noticed Everyone else had also been waiting for a very long time and were getting impatient meanwhile 3 waiters are hanging out gossiping!!!

I'd give zero stars if I could,ate here earlier with my husband and 2 kids,waited forever for food only to be brought out breakfast potatoes that were like 90 years old and hard as rocks (pic posted) My husband was charged 12 dollars for a side salad that said 2.99 with purchase,couldn't let the waitress know cause of course she never came around,except for an hour later to bring us a check for the most disgusting food and terrible service,I would never eat there again,waste of time and money.",VfualxeJJaNOxLComAzTsg,3,0,1,qUZWRaf9Q3cKTt9TKzIa6w

It was lunch time, and not too busy, but it still took awhile for anyone to show up at the host stand so we could be seated. We then waited and waited and waited for a waiter.  Not an acknowledgement by anyone or even a glass of water.  Finally, a waiter stopped by after about 15 minutes and said he'd be right back.  We then watched as he dealt with a few other tables for another 5+ minutes.  He then landed at the booth behind ours, and proceeded to have a VERY long friendly chat, completely ignoring the fact that we were STILL waiting.  That was the last straw, and we left.  Told him and the host we were leaving, but nobody seemed too concerned.",jdiRcAMTA-dROFn4VBOPdQ,1,0,1,vAOwC9MvDtYNzp-uVtWysg
5614650,2017-11-13,0,VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A,"Before a High Roller ride, my husband & I decided to have a breakfast nearby. We were surprised to see Canter's Deli from our Yelp app. Since we're from LA, we had been to the Fairfax location. 
    At 1st, we were skeptical because of the 2 star rating and the negative reviews. But as  we're in the casino area we took our chances (LOL). And we're grateful that we did. 
    1st win:  Upon entry, we were greeted by a smile as we were seated in a comfortable place. Noticed the cleanliness of this deli, great atmosphere. 
     2nd win: service - Our drinks were served real quick. Our orders came just right on time & were served hot the way that I requested from our server.
      3rd win: food - OMG. My hubby ordered the pastrami sandwich. I ordered the combo sandwich (pastrami & corned beef) . We added the matzo ball soup. These came with sides of pickles and green tomatoes. The rye bread was soft & fresh. The matzo ball was savory.  The huge serving of pastrami was seriously delicious & melted in our mouths. 
      For the negative price comments: our huge servings relatively covered 2 meals versus 1 meal, not to mention the great taste of our food, clean place and cozy dining area.  Come on, you're in Vegas. I bet everyone else spends more to have fun. Then why not spend on something that satisfies your hunger & gives you a nice dining experience. 
        Canter's - you're now in the list our favorite spot in Vegas.",KWS0883bbBEJoDlCiyDBuw,5,2,5,5HaJtTr7QCwj2TApPJP96g

This is an imitation and a totally different restaurant. Food is not as flavorful as it is supposed to be, bakery does not serve the New York style desserts,  The deli selections are totally limited and don't even look fresh. The portion size and plating or completely different so IF you are from Los Angeles and you were expecting to have the Canters experience you will NOT get it here.

The food was good; your standard eggs and such from a diner or deli. Nothing outstanding.   Canter's serves breakfast all day so that's nice and the selection looks good, however the service was really sub par.  I had ordered rye toast.  They bake on the premises, so I wanted to try it.  A food runner brought our meal and forgot the toast and then forgot that he forgot the toast.  Our server was no where to be found.  He never checked back on us.  We waited for what seemed like forever and finally flagged down a different server.  Eventually we got some toast which I didn't get to eat with my eggs.  Maybe next time.  We will probably come back and hope for better service next time.",oKFlp5Hwaq5Ex9kDzaXa2g,1,0,3,iHdwxGczNdcJV-5mwNVtUw

We did wait a bit for our server but when he did come by his positivity and honesty about our wait was highly appreciated. They did not carry a lot of their menu items but our server Josh gave us the rundown on what they did have. I Gave a 4 star review based off of our service and quality of our food. Food was AWESOME!! We had Josh give our compliments to the chef! If you can, ask for Josh you won't be sorry! Great server with a positive attitude and doing extremely well with what they've got here!",eI1RddsMUtQrJ-RTq0V_Sw,0,0,4,DcW-ofV_QU97ixehtyqtfQ
5769847,2017-11-15,0,VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A,"Ok so... I wasn't expecting the best deli I've ever been to coming in.   I usually notice that the larger a chain gets the less the quality of the food is important.  Also, this location hasn't been open for very long so there are going to be a few kinks no matter what. 

Upon walking in we had no idea what to do.   Someone at the meat counter was very friendly and asked if we wanted a sample of anything which is very nice but we were lost.   There were quite a large amount of employees but they all seemed to be being trained. 

We went to a register that was closed but the girl standing there didn't acknowledge us or point us in the right direction.  Finally I asked what looked like the manager and she told us there was only one register. 

The cashier at this register was training 2 others and he was very nice and friendly.   

The food we ordered was actually better than I expected!  The corned beef was delicious and I've never had pickled green tomatoes and I thought they were great.  The potato knish had a great flavor but the outside was super tough.   Like I could hardly rip it tough.   If I ate gluten  (the knish totally has gluten and I had hives for it but it was that good inside) I totally would have ordered a bagel because they looked pretty delicious. 

Overall I think this place succumbs to typical Vegas Strip chain eating.   Very expensive but pretty mediocre.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,1,0,3,xc-44-RXXWdseXEtZXmpZw

5811871,2018-03-17,0,VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A,"I was not aware they had a location near the High Roller until I ventured out for a walk that night. They used to have a location inside the TI Sports Book and they left several years ago and a horrible Chicago deli has replaced Canters. I used to eat at Canters when I lived in LA and thought this deli was about as close to NYC as you would find on the Left coast.

I enjoyed a wonderful pastrami sandwich which reminded me of Katz deli in NYC. The pastrami was hearty and melt in your mouth and they even let me have a sample while I waited for my sandwich. Service was great, waitress was super friendly and so was the other staff. I have definitely found a new home for pastrami and prices are much more reasonable than the overpriced Carnegie deli in the Mirage across the street.

I am looking forward to visiting this joint on my next trip to Vegas in April.",kmW-xDTKKQCsj3GKeeKeqw,0,0,5,fTmkMI0lTuPjJxUn-gVBHw
