Went in on Tuesday to pick up our order and when we got home we realized they had given us the wrong sandwich. When I went in on Wednesday Amanda apologized without me saying anything and gave me a free sandwich for the inconvenience. We always get a warm greeting and the sandwiches are really good!,xV1vt_GaSEUcCqXe8rzJqA,0,0,5,2dWMzRmETtOz8vlb7EuTFw

I stopped here for lunch while in the area and basically Firehouse Subs is what you would get if you were to mix Subway with Quizno's and added a high tech soda fountain. I went the healthy route and ordered the Turkey Salsa Verde; Smoked turkey breast, Monterey Jack, salsa verde sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, wheat roll and nixed the mayonnaise. At 400 calories it is pretty hard to beat.

This was a pretty damn good sandwich considering the caloric investment featuring fresh Turkey and a great zippy kick from the salsa verde sauce. I was impressed! Adding chips and a soda for less than $10.00 didn't hurt either. I will unquestionably try Firehouse Subs if I run into another franchise again.",sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,15,13,3,SHVPrbkpA5p7B9zp1Ea2Zg
