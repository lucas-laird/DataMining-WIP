Food:  You wouldn't expect traditional Korean food from a restaurant called Island... but this place had some amazing food. We ordered several different dishes and they were all great. 

Service: Prompt and Courteous. 

Price:  Great price for the quality of food and service you get.",t66rbY4KPbVdrVTnWdEdhA,0,0,4,FvgZbd6nEQ7yTsR5K_ufdg

Portions are smaller, which is fine because the food is totally different.  The meat is no longer marinated before cooking.  My chicken was pale and unappetizing and flavorless.  Macaroni salad had no taste.  I ordered the combo and it came with a tiny small piece of kalbi, one piece of mijun, and one piece of bland chicken.  I also ordered a chicken teriyaki plate.  Then they gave me one container of kimchee and one small container of macaroni salad, they used to give you those per plate, and now only one? it didn't make sense.
It's terrible, go to the original island style on Sahara.
update: i just ate more of it, the rice is overcooked and mushy, and kalbi also had no taste.  OH and the middle of the chicken was still pink!!!-gave it to the dog, at least someone get so enjoy it.",bgSZ9Jv3NM44JXi2t3Jxyg,0,0,1,mCn5_9LwQQ5IsVHk6vvaag

Just like the #1 location on Sahara, it does not disappoint. Had the Spam-fried rice, meat jun and BBQ chicken. Generous portions and stellar service, considering it's in the food court just outside the supermarket. Russell... you hit another home run outta the park, brah!

Her Hawaiian food is good and her Korean food is not watered down and authentic.  Whenever I go shopping in here for groceries, I have to fight the urge to eat here.  If you do go, try her Yukejang.  Best one so far in town.",qbq4zC9SrZuaQ4-J-wtRuw,1,0,4,o7pi7OnNdFoE85NHuETBCg

The Island Style sign on the wall was covered up, so I wonder if the business has changed owners and name.  The receipt still had the Island Style name on it though.  We ordered the meat jun and bibimbap.   Both meals came with chicken stock soup and kimchee.  The meat jun wasn't as good as the original Island style Restaurant on Sahara.  I hadn't had bibimbap for quite a while, so I don't remember what the exact taste should be like, but to me this one lacked some flavour.  The bowl was huge, but there wasn't really that much rice in the bowl.  Overall not bad for a fast food joint.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,1,1,3,OFJR7PEOWVpJEsZdyhr8OA

We also got a plate of fried mandoo and a couple of Hawaiian Sun drinks.
Solid food and good service as always from Jody. This time Russel even stopped in and we got to ""talk story"" while we were waiting for our order.

This spot is good if you're on the go, but Their Sahara location is even better because you get more banchan with your meal and cannot forget the onolicious boiled peanuts!.....ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,2,0,4,KAbVYGZMvUzfHvlLNXMcTQ

I had the Bibimbap Dolcet, again.  It was good, again.  The portion size was big and the ingredients were fresh.  This place has a mall food court feeling, but the prices are not fast food prices.  My meal was over $10 without drink.  I would come again, but Mr. Tofu is better and the prices are similar.",tixImBjX6uTCBDYcg0JvuA,0,0,3,lzak4WxbPqpIi9NgqmScdQ

I ordered the seafood soondubu, which is one of my favorite all time dishes and i was pretty disappointed. It was mediocre at best, we also ordered the meat jun which was ok.....too sweet for my liking. My wife ordered the bibim nangmyun.....which she loved. I found that the best part of the meal was the banchan. The kimchee was pretty good. Overall the staff was friendly, service was a little slow, but in all fairness they were pretty busy.  I really wanted to like this place, but i left a little disappointed.....i might give them another chance in the future.",xnvSINQTEVg8jnkN8DbKgw,0,0,3,aVOY3b1IxudgFdAsbRlK7Q
4491326,2011-02-27,0,zbZX8D5sd9XZa6l6fQDN1A,I was craving Kalbi again  (what's new) after shopping at the Greenland Supermarket a couple of weeks ago.  I wanted to try something new but It's hard to fight my Kalbi addiction. I'm so glad I found Island Style in the food court because that hit the spot! They give generous portions of Kalbi and its served with rice and Mac salad. The Kalbi was very tender. If you are in a hurry don't eat here because it takes a while to get your food because they make it fresh.  They even offer free water and tea if you don't want to buy a drink. If you drink a lot you may want to purchase a drink or you will be going back and forth because the cups are small.,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,2,4,LjGKjylAgIla-f9XjexO6g

The service was awesome, it was clean, it was not really busy but when we left it was slammed. 

My mother ordered Soft Tofu Soup with Seafood and it was ok. Tofu Hut has better Soft Tofu Soup (Various Styles) but overall it was not bad. I would go back for the meat jun since its one of the few places I know that has it. I sooo miss Dong Yang Inn, Korean Restaurant in Wahiawa. Fried rice, meat jun and a soda!

The Mom and I headed to Greenland for lunch and did a tour to check out each place to see what interested us.  They shouted their wares and specials, hoping to hook us in.  Island Style was our last stop, and for some reason, the Mom was more interested in what they had to offer.

She was eyeing the Bibimbap for $7.95, and I mentioned that the Husband likes that dish too, but with the stone pot version.  We inquired and found out their Dolsat Bibimbap was $8.95.  (She wasn't very familiar with the dish.)  As I pondered what to get, an order of fried dumplings were placed in front of us for another customer.  The Mom was immediately impressed by it and the smart guy at the counter pointed out that you get the dumplings for free if your order was $20 or more.  Of course, that easily sold us and we added the Kalbi Plate ($12.95) to our lunch to get that order of dumplings!

We took a seat nearby and waited for our order.  The order of 10 dumplings were ready first, and they do usually go for $5.95.  It was piping hot and we loved the extra crispy texture.  It was filled with pork and noodles.  Two banchan were given to us as well - kim chee daikon and kim chee cabbage.

The Dolsot Bibimbap came with a side of soup, and it was definitely a generous portion.  We ate as much as we could and packed the leftovers.

The Kalbi Plate came with mac salad and rice, and I enjoyed the tasty beef - lots of flavor indeed.  We also had leftovers of this dish too.

The Husband ended up getting all the leftovers for lunch today and he was a bit skeptical about the bibimbap (sans the hot pot).  However, upon arriving home this evening, he proclaimed that the bibimbap was very good and the kalbi tasted really good for leftovers.  

Overall, sounds like everyone was happy with Island Style - and they make for good leftovers too! 

Aloha Promotion: Free soda with meal (mandu and spam musubi excluded) or free mandu (dumplings) with purchase of $20 or more.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,15,8,4,M4t0hm3MxeZ6WUaIUFZ28A

I honestly was a bit iffy about eating here mainly because 1. I've never heard of it 2. 9.95 for a 3 meat combo plate sounds too good to be true. BUT they had meat jun on the menu so that was the deal maker! Anyone from Hawaii knows how hard it is to find good meat jun away from the island thus my excitement when I saw it on the menu. 

The food: 
I opted for the 3 meat combo plate but opted to swap the BBQ chicken for more meat jun. the serving was good size, 2 slices of kalbi and 2 slabs of meat jun! As an added bonus you get soup and kim chee to round off the meal. 

The kalbi was decent but a little sweet for me. The meat jun wasn't bad a little heavy on the egg to meat ratio but still tasty. 

Def a great value at 9.95 and def a must try for Hawaiians seeking a meat jun fix...",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,0,0,4,qKNHm1mcWnmT-ts51bqnrA
