I live close and have called them numerous times in the last 5 years to try to order but no one would ever answer the phone till last night. So after waiting 5 years I order just a 16 inch cheese pizza and am told it would be ready for pickup in 15 minutes.  I get there 20 minutes later and my pizza is not ready yet, no big deal.  I pay and leave and get home and open the box and inside is a mushy, gooshy mess they call a pizza. It took 2 people just to get a slice out of the box and on to a plate because it was sooo limp. The crust was undercooked where the toppings were, overcooked on the edges, completely tasteless like an unsalted saltine cracker.  The sauce was so disgusting- I do not believe there was any tomato or garlic in it at all, it tasted like a red wine sauce that hadn't been reduced and the alcohol cooked out of it yet.  The cheese was plentiful but stringy and chewy and hard to cut.  We called to let them know it was undercooked and they just said ok and hung up.   I was left still hungry as I opted to throw this horrid mess in the trash instead of making myself sick by consuming it.",02Qbod85rFWE1xZrvUdu6w,0,0,1,Qfc5v7BaB1zzHD2YTUeuOg

After being a regular, the owner started hitting on me every time I went in and referred to women as '' bitches''. Disgusting and I stay away now.",L5AQSmQc7efVptd_uCG96g,1,0,1,2h-bkTtJhVBpan_Jxx8sTg

We order a large pepperoni pizza, and our pizza man couldn't be more excited. He gets to work, and we take our seats in the dining area. There was no difference in the outside temperature and inside which made the twenty minute wait a little bit more excruciating.  The pizza comes out and it is shimmering, light reflecting off its greasy shores.  I attempted to take the first slice off of it, and it slips easily off the server, upside down back into the pan. The lack of rise in the bread and grease had made it completely unwieldy. I take a bite out of one of the slices, and it didn't taste so bad, but it was annoying that I had to roll up the slice to be able to hold it.  So what's wrong with this pizza?

The main problem is the crust either needs to be thick or thin.  If it is thin, then it should be crisp in order to maintain the integrity of the slice.  One solution would be to pre-bake the crust rather than sending it into the oven with all the toppings.  Also, leaner pepperoni could reduce the grease.  

Really nice guy who appreciated our business, but pizza simply missed the mark.",umZPUpLSJuCTXLckxA4nmg,0,0,2,1vLxbqU_si6C2SwUgsgmxA
