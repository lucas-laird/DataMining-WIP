1053102,2016-03-16,0,eFZwGBf2Ec5e5FdHo76gQQ,I'm from New Orleans and the wasthe best homemade gumbo I've had in Las Vegas.  I heard the fried catfish is delicious.  As for the crab boil....crab was very small.  I will not order that again.  I will go here again and get the gumbo and try the catfish for myself.,EjpXGDdnhlJ2rUnAc_w8lw,0,0,4,Y-oCJQTGnKtRjK5FkCkG3w

My tummy is rumbling... we'll just have to see how tomorrow goes, but I may be ill. Dry, dry cake. It's all just like pieces of a bad dream. Just use your better judgment and never eat here. No matter how drunk you are. 
If you can't resist a good time of awful overpriced food, head over to the Seigal Suites and give yourself a little punishment.
If you really hate yourself, order the crab. 
Hey, it was an experience, that's for sure.
Even though I would not classify the service as good, the waitress was a very nice person. (Is that what you say right before you break up with someone?)
Enjoy!",MC0e6zrMjetYx9zIjrV8cw,10,3,1,y-FQJaOSPZw2UeOFRxJ-gw

She tells us to have a seat. After 15 min and a slow restaurant time....we get our water to the table. No silverware or etc. Then another 15 min goes by. She comes back...still miserable looking to take the order. We wait another 15 min. The food comes...still got my friend order wrong. The food was decent...then I asked her why she was mad....she says I'm not mad...I'm just hot. I'm like...you think you hot ""in my mind""....I just walked 20 mins to get here in the freaking sun! In the end...I was pissed...no tip and I usually give a tip to everyone...I just don't think she really gave a dam...so I won't either! Done....",-_S-cGY8zbu9VwMe1jGlnQ,2,0,1,i8_AK4Z85H6UbhEGDCLzyw

I have went there twice on two random times (lunch and dinner)and both times the food was on point. The customer service was outstanding. My husband and could have went anywhere for dinner last night for our anniversary and we choose this place.  You will not be disappointed you will get the best southern home cooking, clean environment, 5 star customer sevice with good prices you can't bet. Ask for the fried catfish, and the is  gumbo ridiculous!!!!! Oh and the sweet tea is the REAL sweet tea.",127yVH9erNmQYN7LE-fk4g,1,0,5,Mm8Pzif6o2FAWwuUJk1tGQ
