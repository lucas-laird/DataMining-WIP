I was actually expecting not so good food, but they're bound to have at least a few good dishes that will fill me up hahaha.

The baked stuffed crab was bomb!  Fried chicken wings..... mmm... finger lick'n good!  The teriyaki chicken on a stick was scrumptious!!!! 

So if you're on the strip and need a quick good bite for lunch, this will definitely fill you up & put you to sleep after hehehe

The only not so good thing is the rice.

Cheers!",cWV0UyQW40wsLGNt3-J30w,3,1,4,A2Wd0X_eI31-1NUjjxGShg

Food was bland and not much variety!  Try something else before going here.,-uMssHJ8gVMNXpbbDdWoFA,3,2,2,bmi6UXIQiKWjZcH-4y-4EA

MGM-Hotel, erstklassig wie auch wohl in den anderen Hotels",oVGHXm1G66DE3C7twLCikQ,0,0,1,VQGoqovloKyC6nlVTn0Zyw

Came in around 10:30 PM & they close at 11. $14.99 per person I believe & I think it was the manager in blue was SO nice. Gave us free drinks! The bus boy on the other hand was so rude. Threw the straws for our drinks on the table & went off. Never once did he crack a smile. The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away. Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt  for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !,qAJ4mwrWYFVtDvL087P0Vw,0,0,4,qktgsReUwhT8otjPAGAFpg

The restaurant itself is a creature of its surroundings. When we drove up, we thought it was closed! The front door had a wood panel covering up a glass panel that was broken. The windows were dirty and needed to be wiped down. Its appears to be one of the original buildings in the strip mall.

The staff was efficient and courteous. More than any other Chinese restaurants in the city. They filled the drink cups quickly. Cleared dirty dishes quickly. Plates and Bowls were well stocked. 

As for the food. It was edible. We didn't get sick. I had salt and pepper crab, steamed mussels and clams, teriyaki chicken, chicken wings, watermelon, cookies, fried bananas... And I can go on and on. 

For the price and location, this works.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,0,1,3,vbwzHeiOy9FCcmJf-HCr4A
