This is extremely frustrating because we pay for the food and it just becomes money lost.

A year ago, I would have given this location 1 star, but they have REALLY improved on everything. The food, obviously, is the same as all the other stores, but here they seem to give larger portions now. Rarely dine in, but the people working the drive thru are so incredibly friendly! A lot of them recognize me and carry on a short conversation, other than the ""do you want sauce"" question. Tortillas are almost always soft and fresh.

Why does it seem that when I pull into any drive-thru the first four cars in front of me pull into the same damn I am?!  This TB was no exception.

While waiting for those four cars to negotiate the squad box, when I pulled up, I found the clerk to be friendly enough.

Eventually I would make my day to the window to pay and pick up my chow.  

Some 15 minutes later, I was back out on Warm Springs. I laid waste to floor boards of my vehicle leaving traces of the A-OK chow while I only sought calories.  My lack of discipline sucks.  TB is not a staple and by no means a favorite.  Generic at best.  One would think the staff would be on point during rush hour.....but it was not.
