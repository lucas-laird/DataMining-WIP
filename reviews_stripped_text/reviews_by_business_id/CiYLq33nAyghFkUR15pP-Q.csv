I'm going to open up with these are no doubt the best tacos I've eaten with no hesitation on that statement. 
So why didn't I write a review sooner? Well I was on vacation and as much as I eat mexican food(almost every day) i do taco's maybe once a week. These taco's stood out in so many areas of how a taco should be put together. From the all star meat to the toppings. They don't leave you hanging here. 
The first day I stood in the longest line in the place not knowing I was in the al pastor line with different meats having different stations until 5 minutes had passed. Too late I was committed and how could all those people be wrong? 2 taco's and a tostada later I'd happily stand in a line 5 times that long. 
Next day, I went back. Normally I love adventuring and trying out new places and new foods when traveling, but I hadn't gave the carne asada a shot yet. Got 2 taco's and carne asada fries. The taco's were again a big hit. If you're like me and feel desire to check a place with great ratings, there's a reason for this one.",_Zx-M77Ej1cudCSwcjLp_w,0,1,5,A0yNFHPRXITie6gXXz9OSA

These are probably the best tacos Ive ever had, I live in San Antonio, TX and Id say Im somewhat familiar with street taco type places but considering all the high end expensive restaurants I visited while in Vegas, and the fact that the most memorable food I ate on the strip were these awesome tacos says alot. 

They added another side to the restaurant itself to make it bigger, probably due to its gaining popularity. The suadera tacos, adobada and carne asada are the best in my opininion. I wanted to try the Lengua but I was just too full. 

Im just glad this place has enough recognition that they had to make it bigger. They deserve all the business they get as long as they keep up with the badass tacos.",DqQFPp-f-Kbjaea2xPIGkQ,0,0,5,Kt2J4K_ps0jRLZRGpFWSLA

3 Adobado Tacos - the texture was crunchy and the meat was flavorful. It wasn't spicy at all though unfortunately. I felt the meat could have been a bit more tender. When they serve you this meat, they cut it off the spinning rotisserie and crisp it up on a pan. I think the crisping on the pan part of it is unnecessary.

Tacos El Gordo started as Mexican Fast Food in Tijuana. There are now locations in San Diego and Las Vegas. Now, these aren't fancy restaurant tacos, this is fast food. Tacos El Gordo is precisely Mexico's version of McDonald's. Unhealthy, greasy, and DELICIOUS.

When you walk in, there are taco stations making different types of tacos. Each meat comes with a unique blend of sauces to enhance the flavor. So, for example, carne asada comes with guacamole, adobada does not. When you order your tacos, they'll ask if you want everything on it, if you say yes, they give you all the sauces that are recommended with that meat. I also ways go for ""everything on it,"" haven't been disappointed yet.

Because the tacos are smaller, it's advisable to order at least three -- or more if you're a hearty eater.  I, of course, recommend the carne asada tacos.  The pork adobada is also really good.  Also, try the mula; it's quesadilla meets taco.  I'm not quite sure why the carne asada french fries are $10.  In San Diego, carne asada french fries are $5, tops.  However, if you're feeling like a baller, the french fries are also an excellent option.

This place is a Tijuana based chain so I knew this place was going to be authentic. As you first walk in you immediately see the boiling baths of meat and the rotating pork stack for the tacos al pastor. This place reminded me of my early days of partying in Tijuana and finding taco vendors on the street.  

The ordering system was a little confusing but the guys behind the counter were helpful to clear up the confusion. Each station has designated meats to choose from so you line up behind the station of your choice of meat. Me being the adventurous eater we decided on three meats, Cabeza (cow head), Lengua (cow tongue), and Tripas (tripe). Each taco is served on freshly made corn tortillas with cilantro, onions and salsa. 

The cabeza and the legua were cooked to perfection, so tender they melt in your mouth. My favorite was the Tripas which were deep fried which gave it a rich fatty taste. MMMMMM soooo goooood!! I had a total of four tacos but could of went for more. 

Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco spots here in Vegas. So if you ever find yourself downtown or looking for some good grub after a late night of drinking head over to Tacos El Gordo for some authentic Mexican street tacos.",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,4,1,5,GX1mw1bKS965SwhykvXdxA

Watch out man food is good but if your not careful you will be paying for some extra tacos you didn't enjoy, I'm just saying check your receipt!!!!

An HOUR AND A HALF wait. .. Try to refrain from going late night on Fridays and Saturdays.
During the busy hours they have you separate into three lines depending on the type of meat you want to order. So bring along friends to divide and conquer those lines. 
The restaurant is fairly big and spacious in size but not big enough with the amount of crowds that roll through here with roughly 10-15 tables inside/5 tables outside. 
Make sure you know what you want to order and be ready to yell out your order to the cooks. It is pretty loud with the amount of people talking over each other and over the loud music. 
Again, i waited 1 1/2 hours to order: Carne Asada Fries. Good amount of meat. Meat was juicy and not dry at all. Fries were not soggy at all and that was a PLUS! Overall pretty tasty.

The adobada sopes were also good it's a spicy shreded pork not very hot spicy but flavorful spicy . Sopes are corn disk that are soft about 3/4 inch thick. We got everything on them avocado sauce, cilantro and onions. 
            
The carne asada fries are covered in the same avocado sauce with of course carne asada , they also have them with the adobada pork, We got the 1/2 order which is more then enough for two. 
Pretty neat place you order your food from the cooks , who make it right there and they also have grilled green onions and jalapenos that you can ask for , I think it was free.

The tacos were really small and I had asked a lady for some onion and she kept ignoring me. I kept calling her and she would look at me and ignore me. The quesadilla was not even a quesadilla it was a cheese taco NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR!! The quesadilla had a hard tostada on top and I was not able to bite it without hurting my teeth.

We had the intentions of trying different tacos but decided to just go with carne asada since we would have to stand at different lines for about 30 minutes.

It took us 30 minutes before it was our turn to order. I would say the tacos are not worth the wait. They are decent but I have had better. The tacos come with guacamole (which doesn't taste like anything) a red salsa, cilantro and onions. I was expecting more flavor based on the reviews. The tacos would probably taste a lot better if they seasoned the meat and guacamole and if they made a salsa that is spicy. 

We did enjoy the free grilled onions and jalapeños. Which is a plus!

Based on the wait and taste we probably will not be back. If there wasn't a long wait we would probably stop by again, but they are definitely not worth the wait.",aiB84XF1T5Khf9u8Q6_azQ,0,0,3,lR1SluCApL8R98Hs-kq-Hg

I can definitely see orthodox Mexican people who see this place as ""nothing special"" or its ""ok"" but I think this place is awesome. I usually line up at the offal counter, which I see the least amount of people.. People have no idea what they are missing. My favourite among the offal tacos is the tripa the texture is unbelievable, and what seemed to be a ""salsa rioja"" was perfect for it. Cabeza taco was my next favourite, I loved it because I am a fan of artery clogging, ""eat it in moderation"" kind of foods. This taco had a very soft beef flavour presented shredded and chopped, served with I guess a salsa verde sauce and cilantro if I remember correctly. I then had the tongue taco, which was okay, not my favourite texture, it had a slithery like texture going down the throat which was interesting. Beef brain taco was an experience; I would consider it to look clumpy and the taste was very neutral, it was somewhat rich and cooked fork tender. Moving on to the standard meat tacos(San Diego location), my favourite was the steak. It had a pleasantly chewy texture, served in strips, I think it has again the salsa verde cilantro mixture and I cannot remember if it was spicy. Tacos adobadas was also delectable, the pork was crispy on the outside, cooked nicely on the inside. Unfortunately I do not remember the sauce or the ingredients but I do remember they all worked in harmony.

Finally made it over here for lunch after several recommendations from friends.  The place was hopping!  Fortunately I had read some reviews and was able to navigate the line system, but I can see it being confusing for the uninitiated.
Ordered a mix of carne adovada, carne asada & suadero tacos.  Adovada was by far the most enjoyable.  Suadero was tender and smoky.  Carne asada was passable, but not my favorite in town.  The corn tortillas were pulled fresh off the grill, and the various sauces that accompanied the tacos were flavorful.  Everything here was good, but outside of the carne adovada I wouldn't classify anything as great.  Maybe my expectations were too high, as the tacos had been described as a ""life-changing experience."" Who knows...
Service was definitely friendly and the lines move relatively quickly.  Bottomless horchata is a plus.  All-in-all, a pleasant experience.",8JnKfxdonJ8hCrDFOeV7pQ,0,0,3,hk5l1CKkAn9L8IfbkYJM0Q

As busy as it was, the line went quickly. The menu is pretty simple and I chose the asada tacos and the adobada tacos. They were filled with meat, onion, cilantro, salsa and an avocado green sauce. It was almost hard to pick them up since they had so much meat in them. I like they don't skimp on the meat :) Both tacos were very good, although I liked the adobada better.

theres 3 sections with 3 different meats. you wait in whichever line you want tacos from. the only downfall is that its kinda pricey at $2/ taco. but its definitely worth it. after getting all your food you go to the cashier to pay. 

the fries are AMAZING. they pack it to the rim, i almost couldn't close the box! i think they're far BETTER THAN ROBERTOS carne asada fries. and you get to pick from different meats, such as spicy pork (YESSS!) carne asada and a combo of both. ($10)

As prior reviewers have said, the superstar is the adobada.  The adobada line is the closest to the door and always the longest for a reason -- it's a flavor explosion.  Just make sure you ask for the pineapple and everything on it, those little additions just put it over the top.

My other faves are the carne asada, suadero, and lengua.  If you're in the mood for lengua, I'd suggest refraining from ordering the other tacos.  The simplicity of the flavors in the lengua taco -- complimented with just a sprinkling of cilantro and onions--might get overwhelmed if you flank it with an adobada which has a lot going on. 

The price for this place is also phenomenal.  I'm always stuffed after two tacos, which are $2 a piece, for a grand total of $4.00 plus tax.

In all seriousness, these tacos were amazing. I've loved Mexican food most of my life, and having lived in the southwest, I thought I'd gotten a pretty good sampling without actually going to Mexico. These were fawesome and made me a little sad that I had ""wasted"" 88 tacos' worth of money at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon the night before. The meat was succulent and flavorful. We requested ""everything,"" so each taco came with its own unique combination of fixings. I was a little nervous when I saw the heaping guacamole, but it was quite good and accentuated the meat flavor well. The giant rotating adobada is the first thing you see when you enter, and it sets the atmosphere perfectly. There's one giant counter. but there are four separate lines (in front of each grill) for ordering. Be mentally prepared to receive your tacos in hand in less than 30 seconds.

Do not be tricked into going to Los Tacos which is right next door. I haven't tried it but I can only assume it's inferior. I mean, it has a drive thru for God's sake!",JRkVLt7xIlL11kDc3xPLww,1,0,5,u-u89Pr_v8z2p09W1HkHVQ

Call us Taco connoisseurs, if you will. We know how to find the best tacos anywhere and have had them everywhere form the boarder to the middle of Nebraska but if they have them, we will find them. At Tacos El Gordo we found them indeed!

This place has two dollar tacos which is a price hard to beat anywhere on the strip. They are expanding their store so you MIGHT not have to stand outside, but with as busy as this place is, you probably will have to for a short time. They serve ALL kinds of delicious tacos ranging from if you are brave or just want the amazing NOT average taco. By that I mean you can have the cow brain or carne asada (beef) and anything in between. They add a slice of pineapple to it which seriously makes the tacos out of this world and your meal would not be complete without horchata served perfectly cold to you. On the side is fried onions and peppers and add their avocado sauce to anything and everything! Also, many times the best Mexican food must be found in, forgive me, more ghetto looking areas so you know it is legit or out of a taco truck. Here, it is so clean and they serve things so well!

Oooey, gooey cheese, perfectly marinated spicy pork, sour cream, and spoonfuls of guac top the perfectly fried and crispy fries. I've always been one to get carne asada fries at the Mexican joints down in SD or any other noteworthy spots comparable to those in SD. However, after sampling an adobada taco and a carne asada taco, I was up for trying the adobada fries and I'm glad I did! In my opinion the spicy pork was tastier than the carne asada (which can be seen on a rotating spit), although the carne asada wasn't a bad choice either. Note that an order of adobada (and I assume the same goes for carne asada) fries can be ordered in a medium ($5-$6) or large size ($10). I didn't know the medium existed until the server asked which size I wanted. I'm glad they offered this since I was already full from the two tacos I had sampled earlier!

Yeah, this joint isn't in the best location in Vegas, but that's part of the ""experience"". Hey, if that means there's less tourists, then I'm in! The servers can talk English, so just speak your order without any frills and you should be fine. Or, you can always test out the old Spanish-speaking skills you learned from school or Rosetta Stone!

It's true that there are several lines depending on the meat that you want. The far right corner was for spicy pork and I think carne asada, the next one was for the more ""exotic meats"" (tripe, cabeza, lengua, etc.), the third one to the right was for chorizo, and the last one was for grilled onions, quesadillas and such. Drinks are ordered in the center counter found toward the middle, back part of the room which is where you pay for your items.

After reading a few reviews of this place at work, I had to try it on my day off. 

I really like the idea of ordering from the cooks, which is how this place operates. On April 5th, at around 9:30PM, I ordered 3 Carne Asada and 3 Adoboda tacos. The order also came with grilled green onions and yellow chillies on the side. Their green chili sauce is SO good too. 

The tacos were fantastic. OK in size at first glance, but after eating a couple, they pack a good punch. Still no match for my appetite on this day. I never tried Adoboda before and it looked so good roasting in front of me, so that was easy to order. The Asada was also looking good just off the grill. Both tacos were really good, however, I did enjoy the Adoboda more than the Asada. Also, the side onions and chillies are mandatory (for me) after tasting them with my meal. 

Overall, I can't wait to back to this place again. I'm definitely going to get more Adoboda tacos and try what else they have to offer.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,0,0,5,IYwZEx8q4QUlGJZrZH-2Yw

The tacos al pastor are crazy delicious. The abadoba fries cannot be beat (I did not eat any, but the person I bought them for ate literally non stop and with a vengeance). 

Some people don't like the $2.00 per taco price, but most places are around $1.79 - $1.89 and don't come close. So  less than a quarter more per taco for 10 X's the flavor is still a good deal to me. 

The only drawback is the process. You get to the window, belt out your order, hang back and wait. You need to keep an eagle eye on your food otherwise it might unintentionally walk off. After that you wander over to the cashier and pay. Don't get me wrong, it works, just a bit unorganized is all. 

With that said, the staff is great and the place is very clean. 

Also, I would (as mentioned in my other reviews) hit the tip jar when you place your order. It not only helps the staff out but almost always insures an exceptional meal.",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,0,0,4,YsJuYn36m5OTHaKzgbNn5Q

This is a very authentic and traditional taco shop so don't expect burritos here. They do however have carne aside fries that can be ordered with al pastor pork as well. The high light of this awesome place is the al pastor (marinaded pork roasted on a vertical spit) and the fact that the carne aside is cooked over wood fire. I've lived in California and Las Vegas my whole life and I can honestly say these are the best tacos. Nothing really comes close to Tijuana tacos like this place.,OAKWWShaL9Qe2eAE29fetA,1,0,5,NCW9Pm-I8JdMNp4LYqa85g

They have a huge rack of Pork complete with Pineapple dripping down onto it, and it is hand cut as well as the Tortillas are being hand made right before your eyes!

When I heard they've moved from their old location, I was devastated!! Now that I'm here for the first time at their new location, here's a few things I've learned during my visit....

1) their crazy ordering line is still in place. Try opting to try some crazier stuff like their head, tongue or even tripe. There is absolutely no line for this window

2) grab a buddy. The more the merrier. Split up and grab a buddy for the carne asada line, their adobada line, and a SEAT!  They've increased their seating but people seem to be grabbing them fast so it's best if you have a body to secure one

3) don't be rude. Don't be that guy trying to cut in line. People will cuss you out. (I've seen it happen) lol

4) a lot more somewhat organized than the old location...in a weird way. I remember at the old location it was kind of a free for all and people were just yelling out orders but it seems a lot more tamed this time around...

They trim the meat right in front of you and you have the option to let them know exactly what you want on them. I got cilantro, onions, and sauce and they were delicious. I really mean DELICIOUS!!! The tortillas tasted so fresh like they had been just made today. They give you a fair amount of meat so I was full after 4 tacos which were the typical size ""street tacos"".

Service was okay and difficult to find a place to sit if you wanted to dine in. Although it was a long time standing in line, the people making the tacos are extremely fast and thorough however it's just crowded. Hats off to the cooks!

So this year's resolution was to eat healthier and to rid myself from any kind of addicted dependency but how can I do it when there's a f 'kng taco dealer in almost every corner here in Vegas? Specially tacos El Gordo where they can hook you up  with the purest and tastiest al pastor, asada , lengua and tripas tacos. So delicious and so addicting you would think that Walter White was actually doing all the cooking for you.
 Service is great friendly and efficient, the place is also very clean there's always an employee going around picking up trays and cleaning tables since this place is always packed with taco junkies. Every time I feel the urge to move to Colorado I stop at tacos El Gordo to remind myself of a reason to stay in Vegas. I swear nothing could beat a rolled taco with cilantro at tacos El Gordo. I only wish they were open 24 hours since is usually at the very late hours of the night when I start getting all those taco withdrawals after consuming a few spirited beverages.
They open late till 2am on weekdays and till 4 am weekends so make sure you leave the party or the club before that time so you can ingest some alcohol absorber. sometimes I get there late ( yes, I'm the one who knocks ) and end up looking for Roberto for an inferior fix.
I have tried other places and this are the tastiest and best street style tacos in town by far for the price. 
Take a break from that treadmill, throw those diet pills away and get yourself some antacids instead and drive to tacos El Gordo right now for some instant satisfaction.
Why?

Be a little more brave when you get up to the counter and order things like tongue and tripa (intestines). If you can get your mind past your American upbringing, explosive flavors await. Do not expect anything past bare-bones decor and service at Gordo, because it certainly does not care about them either. This place is driven toward one goal: fast, tasty, authentic Mexican fare. And it not only reaches that goal, it kicks it in the balls and then stomps all over it (in a good way).",JqfQCJlKeiALcL3v0bYjAw,1,0,5,_CqwQk0wW2iwz81Ar384dw
1352473,2014-02-03,1,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"I've been hearing about this place for a long while from various friends, specifically one friend. Finally decided to try it when near the area. 

Super busy location. First time ive been to a restaurant like this. There are different lines for different things you want. Top favorite meat among a lot of people is the spicy pork (adobada). Then of course, you have the usual carne asada, as well as the more ""exotic"" eats like stomach, tongue, etc

Their taco's are priced pretty much around the same price ~$2/ea with exception to the tongue being $2.25

Aside from the tacos, another popular thing that was suggested were carne asada fries. Being one who has tried carne asada fries in the past from another place (Roberto's), i was eager to try these ! 

Adobada - spicy pork, freshly sliced off the rotating spit. Seasoned nicely. Not spicy (sadly) but still delicious

Carne Asada - Freshly cooked on the hot plate and sliced. More towards the medium  to medium well but still fairly tender. Would like a less meat temp cook but they probably use a better quality or cut of meat to produce a nice tender texture. 

Pork Stomach - simmering in an unknown broth, cut upon order. Very tender and flavorful. 

Beef Tongue (lengua) - same as the stomach, cut upon order. Super flavorful and tender. Tongue has a different texture than normal meat but its porous in a way to soak up some of the broth it was sitting in

Nice location, which they'd open one up on the west side of town. I believe there's one on the Strip as well.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,5,sIx08MZsPQmmecCWn-m3fw

I love pork on my tacos and Tacos El Gordo does it right.  Adobada I guess is a relative to al pastor or is very similar hence my love for this place.  The adobada comes off a huge rotisserie, that they carve it off the rotating piece of meat and satay the carved meat.  The tacos adobadas are topped with this spicy green sauce and pineapples [if requested].  3-4 tacos are an adequate amount for a meal and a half order or french fries with adobada is a must.

We were starving after visiting the Valley of Fire, and craving tacos, so decided to stop here.

I had NO idea what the buche was - it's pork stomach - and while it was my least favorite (so greasy), it was still good. 

Everything was super good, although everything was a bit greasy. My favorite was the chorizo, followed by the the adobada. Tip for those who don't usually eat this type of taco: Let them put all the toppings they usually do on your tacos because it helps cut the grease a bit. This may be inauthentic but I think it helps immensely. 

If we came again I would try the fries, since they looked amazing.

No seriously, it's that good.

Whenever an establishment has several hundred reviews, and averages 4.5 stars, you can bet that their shit is pretty good.  Tacos El Gordo doesn't disappoint.

There is nothing that I can write in my review that other Yelpers haven't already told you.  The food is fucking good.  It's fucking filling.  And it's fucking cheap.  That's like the Yelper dream trifecta.  So instead of sitting on your iPhone, go now, and thank me later.

Warning: I'm part Mexican.  Which means that I fit in well in this part of Las Vegas.  This is NOT your Las Vegas strip by the Bellagio type of crowd.  This is your recently immigrated type of crowd.

My sister and I had gotten a craving to come here since we hadn't been for awhile, and we were jealous that the little brother got to go without us... Sister Date! Anyway...
The ordering is pretty much the same, you pick a line with the meat you want, then tell them how you want it. My sister got to try Lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and we also ordered Adobada (pork) fries. The all the toppings still taste as fresh as can be. Both orders were fully loaded. Hahaha... Eating here can get messy, so ask for extra napkins. My sister was also surprised that she enjoyed the lengua: ""Taste more like regular beef than anything different, and texture isn't bad."" Took awhile for the fries, but it came out fresh so there aren't any gripes there, plus they still loaded it with the pork. 
Oh man... We over-ordered though 'cause we forgot how big of the fries was, which was 1 entire to-go container. I helped her with about 3/4 of that thing, and we were supposed to half it! Shouldn't have ordered the tacos as well, but man... It was worth it! Our cravings are more than satisfied! 
Customer service is still good. Nice guys when you order up at the counter, and the ladies are always friendly when you pay.

Tacos El Gordo is straight up authentic Mexican food at its finest. When it wasn't very dangerous to venture to Tijuana, MX, I would easily drive 10 minutes south and go to Tacos El Gordo to get my taco fix (also because it was cheaper than getting it 10 minutes north from where I lived in SD, in Chula Vista, CA :P).  As a SOUTH San Diego, CA native, and having experienced the many taco shops that saturate the SD area I've had to settle for OK Mexican tacos in Las Vegas, NV or even avoid considering tacos as an eating out option. I guarantee Tacos El Gordo is THE best tacos you'll find in town because it's seriously the best in SD and I find it an awesome relief that they brought the best to Las Vegas.  

Since I'm a carne asada fan, I've only had their carne asada tacos and tostadas. The flavor and spice of their carne asada is so delicious and they grill it to perfection! The employees here are just pros at grilling and flavoring the meats to perfection. My fiance is all about the pork adobada! He scafs down his order in a ridiculous amount of time; he'll finish 4 of those tacos faster than I can finish two.

Pros: the hours of operation--it's better than in San Diego! :P and it's authenticity is further accentuated because it is situated in a similar, run down area to that in South San Diego. Unlike other places where they tend to put less meat and more of the other items, Tacos El Gordo loads it up with lots of meat and a great balance of the toppings (onions/cillantro/guac etc.). Lastly, their red and green salsas are the s**t!!!! (tasty with the right amount of spice!)

Cons: far from where I live in Las Vegas and the prices are a little bit expensive than in San Diego but comparable to other taco/mexican food places in Las Vegas and they don't offer seafood options for those who crave shrimp or fish tacos as an alternative to the land animals.

Love the homemade tortilla and all but the tacos were not all that special. I've had way better in LA.

1786089,2016-07-04,7,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"BRAINS! BRAINS! BRAINS!  BRAIN TACOS! I LOVE TO EAT BRAINS!

During a recent lengthy stay in Vegas, I finally found time to get myself from my Old Town/Downtown hotel over to Tacos El Gordo on East Charleston -- a shop which I had known about for a couple of years primarily because of the fact that if offers brain tacos, but had heretofore been unable to visit during earlier Vegas stays simply due to time constraints. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that I had been dying for several years, during previous visits to Vegas, to visit this shop?

So, I ended up visiting the shop for my very fist time on Tuesday, June 28th at about 12:15 PM;  I would have preferred to have visited the shop at about 11 AM, well before the onslaught of the lunchtime crowds, but my schedule did not allow it, and once I arrived at the shop, the lunch crowd turned out to be quite manageable.

Since I was a total newcomer, once I had arrived at the shop it took me a couple of minutes to figure out in which line I would need to stand in order to order the brain tacos that I was CRAVING, and, still a bit disoriented (largely because I was craving BRAINS), I finally needed to ask one of the chefs at one of the shorter lines, and he quickly, with a smile, pointed me to the correct line, which luckily turned out to be one of the very short lines (unlike the very long line for ordering pork and beef-filled tacos...), with only two people standing in line in front of me. I reached the chef within three minutes of having joined the line.

Best of all, it turned out that this was also the line for ordering tripe (stomach) tacos, which happened to be the only other type of taco filling in which I was interested. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

The ordering process, once I had figured it out, was great, and easy, and the chef on my line was great; he was obviously very happy (but then again, who wouldn't be happy if they were standing in front of a large bowl of scrambled BRAINS?) and he had a funny sense of humor. In very short order, he made up my large batch of brain tacos to go, replete with the exact toppings that I wanted on them (I love onions and some of the other toppings that were available at his station, but hate chopped raw cilantro, and the chef was great about avoiding the cilantro on my behalf...). Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

When I reached the check out counter, I discovered, to my great pleasure, that they had at least two kinds of homemade hot sauce, each in small plastic cups with lids, stored in the fridge that they could and would pack with my order upon request. (When I got back to the hotel with my food, I discovered that both the red and the green hot sauces were GREAT!) They also had great medium-sized cups of rice pudding (with cinnamon on top) available in the cooler behind the cashier as well, at a very cheap price. I ended up getting several cups of the hot sauces, and also ordering five cups of rice pudding to bring back to my hotel room with me, since I still had about 5 days of my stay in Vegas ahead of me. However, what excited me the most was the simple fact that I would shortly be leaving the shop with a bag in my hands that was filled with BRAIN tacos! Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

I ate some of the very delicious brain tacos 20 minutes later for my lunch in my hotel room, and the leftover tacos served as my lunch meal again the next day. Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS?

My only regret is that during my first and only visit to the shop, I had not ordered more of the brain tacos. I should have ordered about 20 of them, and then stuffed them all (well, except for the few that I would eat for my lunch that first day) in the fridge in my hotel room. In case I have not yet mentioned this fact, I love to eat BRAINS, and that my very favorite brain meal of all time is BRAIN TACOS. In fact, BRAIN TACOS ares even better than BRAINS in tomato sauce on pasta, and even better than fried BRAINS.

In closing, I want to say that I love to eat brains. And my favorite brain meal of all time is brain tacos. The brain tacos and the tripe tacos from this shop were beyond excellent. The service at the shop was also excellent. I only wish that I had ordered more of each to bring back to my hotel room, as I had a large fridge in the room that could have held lots of BRAIN tacos! 

I am seriously thinking of moving full-time to Vegas, to a small apartment located just a few feet from the front door of this shop, just so that I can eat BRAIN tacos for each of my three meals each day! Did I mention yet that I love to eat BRAINS?

Will definitely visit this fine shop again on my next Vegas trip. BRAINS!",Ariwz06at3CtbWZM-gPMAg,6,4,5,mK-vY7WqzfJnZdBgCq_6lA

Bought 1 asada taco, 2 adobada tacos, 1 chorizo taco, and carne asada fries. Yes I do eat a lot so please excuse my endless appetite.

The tacos were delicious! Very well cooked and they pound it with guacamole, which I'm not used to since they don't do that in LA at your standard taco stand. But it's nice for a change. The adobada is practically the same as pastor.. Marinated pork. The sauces on the other hand were good but not great. Nothing too special but nothing beats spicing up that Mexican quench in your mouth!

The one thing I dislike about this place is the price. $2 for a single taco... and they charge you tax too, so technically even more than that. Maybe I'm just too used to $1 tacos from my hometown but that is pretty greedy of the Gordo management.

This is located in a pretty dead and shady neighborhood so be warned. I also kept getting stared at in which, I guess is cause I was the only Asian there. Asian or Mexican, it doesn't matter.

They must've hired new cooks or Rita's Grill is just that much better because I was extremely dissatisfied with my food. The fries were extremely poor in quality. They tasted as though they pulled them from the freezer. And the overall amount of food in my full sized box was extremely meager.

I've been to Tacos El Gordo once before and didn't get the Al Pastor. Shame on me, I know. Every time I bring up that Los Tacos (across the street) is underrated and might be better all my friends say, ""NO WAY! TACOS EL GORDO IS WAY BETTER!"" So today I took my wife on a taco tasting to eat at both places. Below are my thoughts on Tacos El Gordo, check my Los Tacos review too!

I came here for one thing only. Al Pastor tacos. But I would also suggest getting Mullas if you haven't had them before. Delicious. 

But the Al Pastor is perfect. Spicy pork with crispy bits and very juicy. The avocado cream and salsa all compliment the meat perfectly. They're delicious no doubt about it. Little bites of pineapple to just add that pop of tart citrus. Just a really excellent taco.

But nothing else here stands out as MUST HAVE. It's a one trick pony. And they have that stupid ordering system where you gotta wait in line get your food, wait in line pay, and by the time you sit down the Taco is soggy. So inefficient it kills me.

Based on the Al Pastor alone place is a winner. But rest of the menu and the ordering set up brings it down a peg for me.",ATiE5_7Md8S3yO3CbEHXWQ,0,0,3,EcB79Qns6gjiWpiwqvXBAg

Came here during lunch time and place was filled (not one table available and they had plenty). Hey, must be a good sign!

*Ordering Food was Different Here - There were different lines for like different vendors.. Facing the counter - For example: Left side for the chili peppers, Right of that for Carne Asada and  on the Far Right for the Adobada (spicy pork). They have little pails/tip jars on top of the counter that had labels on them that displayed what each station served. Interesting concept..

Carne Asada (steak) tacos: I have been down south numerous times in the past and have had the chance to try some street vendor tacos and this had similarity.. Probably better.. They did serve them on homemade corn tortillas (you can ask for flour if you please) and the typical cilantro, tomato and onions plus guacamole. The steak had its own unique flavor (much different from Robertos), tender and the tortilla just sealed the deal! 

Adobada (spicy pork) tacos: This was a first for me, and won't be the last.. This staton had the longest line for a tasty reason! They shave off the meat from a vertical Rotisserie (like Shawarma), same toppings as the asada except instead of the guac they add this light green sauce. The pork was dark in red in color, super soft, had an unfamiliar yet delicious flavor and the creamy green sauce was the Star of the taco! Another spoonful of the Salsa Verde, Por Favor!  

Yellow & Green Chili peppers and Green Onion Strands: I had a bite of each with just about every bite of the tacos.. Delish!

And Now for the Highlight of the Meal and the Rest of my day - 2 Words: ORANGE BANG!!!!!

Lines move fairly quickly but you can wait up to 30 minutes. But I promise you its definitely  worth it. I'm not a huge fan of the carne asada. It has too much of a smokey flavor in my opition.

Beim Bestellen sollte man wissen, in welche Schlange man sich stellt. Links gibt's Gegrilltes wie Steak, Chorizo etc. Mitte Gekochtes. Rechts Würziges Schweinefleisch vom Spieß. Abhängig davon was man bestellt, gibt es als Soße entweder Guacamole, Salsa oder grüne Salsa. Als Beilage gibt es immer Zwiebeln, Tomaten und Koriander.
Beim ersten Besuch sollte die Wartezeit 2 Stunden betragen. Da die Schlange quer durch den Laden führte, entschied ich mich am nächsten Tag wiederzukommen. Musste ja genial sein, dass die Leute bereit sind so lange zu warten. Obwohl der Laden um 9 öffnete, musste ich über 30 Minuten warten bis ich das Taco mit Steak bekam. Die Chorizos waren nach 10 Uhr nicht mal fertig. Es war rein gar nichts fertig!!! Also ging es erst an die mittlere Bestelltheke. Die dort servierten Tacos schmeckten nach nichts. Alles zerkocht und ungewürzt. Auf den Spieß rechts hatte ich am Ende keine Lust mehr, weil ich meinen Vormittag nicht damit verbringen wollte auf Tacos zu warten, die nicht mal wirklich nach was schmeckten. 
Das Bestellsystem ist mehr als optimierungsbedürftig, da das, was ich sehen durfte sowas von ineffektiv war, ja fast idiotisch. Jeder Koch nimmt gleichzeitig die Bestellung auf und serviert. Wie soll man bei drei Bestelltheken mit unterschiedlicher Nachfrage gleichzeitig essen? Die einzige Möglichkeit gemeinsam und alles zu essen ist wenn Laden leer ist. Alles andere ist utopisch. Und dann mit dem vollen Tablett zur Kasse, die sich dann auch beim Eingang befindet. So stolpert der bezahlende den reinkommenden über die Füße und tritt den wartenden auf die Zehen. Was ein Chaos!

They have lots of tables and chairs inside and outside but it does get super crowded. There is parking in front of the restaurant as well.

We only waited in the carne asada line but we ordered a al pastor quesadilla which they helped us get instead of making us wait again in the other line (how nice of them!)

The al pastor quesadilla was AMAZING. It was an open face quesadilla and the cheese was grilled onto the tortilla, leaving a crispy crunchy cheese layer and they then put the juicy al pastor on top. I was in heaven. Next time I'm definitely getting this !!! I already think the tacos are awesome but this was on a whole other level!

Upon walking in, the amorous fragrance of the spices grab your nose and the various meats cooking make your mouth water like an infant drooling! Yes, it's just like that! My favorite spectacle of the restaurant is the BBQ spit that holds the fresh al pastor meat (marinated spicy pork)! I suggest the al pastor mula with everything (cilantro, onions, salsa, and avocado salsa) and suadero (marinated beef) tacos with everything! Make sure you don't forget the FREE grilled peppers and green onions at the end of the ordering line :)

Grab your limes, pay, and ask the cashier if you'd like some salsa. If you choose to get a fountain drink, I suggest getting a cup full of some refreshing orange bang (whipped orange drink that tastes like an orange creamsicle) and brace yourself for some filling, satisfying, flavor packed, and the most authentic Mexican grub this side of the border!

Didn't look like it was a hassle for parking but what do I know, since we took an Uber here.

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Not too big of a restaurant but man, was it packed! Mm, the lines were long for every section. They have a system where you line up for the for meat you want to order. Unfortunately, because it is set up that way, it can either take longer for you for faster, depending on what combination of food you want. After you get what you want to eat, you go by to the cashier and pay up.

Outdoor tables have heater above for when it gets cold at night. Indoor is packed and the line is unrelenting.

MENU
The last time I have been here, there was no pineapple! Luckily for me, this time, pineapple was available! I went for the Adobada and Al Pastor tacos along with the Mula, which was recommended by a fellow individual in line. Along with the Horchata, this order was way too much for me. As I finished three tacos, I was already full. However, everything was delicious and the pineapple leaves a refreshing sweetness on your palette.

Compared to the street tacos, these tacos are a little bigger and a little more expensive but it is worth swinging by when you are in Las Vegas or San Diego!

The tacos are pretty pricey in comparison to what I am used to back in LA at $2+ a pop.
The fries are $10 but plentiful and very much meant to be shared.

Second venture was much more fruitful - Thursday evening at 7:30.  Only one person ahead of us and the process was easy: you go to the line of the meat of your choice and place an order.  That's about it.  You pay at the counter to the right of the ordering area, where you can order beverages or desserts.

Now, the taste: I chose the carne asada fries because, well, carne asada fries.  Since the meat is fresh off a grill, it definitely has a lot more flavor.  And I can definitely see why - the carne asada was so tender.

I look forward to my next venture here. :)",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,1,0,5,EQlIt12iSck_WDLrI0aVOg

I was really excited to introduce this place to the husband so we came for lunch. We ordered 6 tacos adobadas con pinas. Apparently some guy ordered a mula  (the workers call it ""mulita"" though)  but ended up not wanting it, so we got coaxed into ordering this mula because they offered us extra meat (ugh, I'm so easy sometimes). 

We bit into the tacos and the meat was flat. There was no tantalizing of the tastebuds. I was embarassed about my ravings. It was definitely their ""off"" day. Then we bit into the mulita and it was so salty! The saltiness was exacerbated by the cheese and the red sauce. It was simply messy dish and I would not order it again (even if they gave me extra meat, haha!) I noticed that a lot of other patrons had ordered mulitas and they were enjoying it. I think ours turned out to be bad because it was probably sitting out for more than 10 minutes. Ugh, why am I so easy sometimes!

Anyway, I'm going to give El Gordo one more shot and hopefully this time around it'd be as excellent as my first experience.

BF was never really a lengua fan, but he tried it again here and he's been converted! The most tender lengua I have ever had.

Cabeza is also super tender. Adobada of course is a must have. They even have sesos. I've been wanting to try it for ages, but no one sells in the CA anymore. Well I can finally say I tried cow brains, but I can't say I liked it. It had the texture of custard (what I kinda expected) but it left a faint irony taste in my mouth that I didn't care for. But don't get me wrong, I finished that bugger! I just didn't go for seconds. ;)

I also love how they automatically put the salsas on it for you. So there isn't another line at the salsa bar. They only have limes and radishes at the self serve bar.

Don't be shy if you don't speak Spanish! These people are super nice and everyone speaks perfect English. If you have any question about what is what, just ask. When I ordered the sesos, they guy was like ""Are you sure? It's brains!""

* Super fast service

* NO SALSA BAR!!!  
* Only bar available has lime/rábanos in it  
* Tacos are very small & overpriced
* $7.50 for 3 little tacos... no worth it IMO
* Meat didn't really have much flavor, if it wasn't for the salsa they add on topic it would've been bland.

The meats are ordered in different lines, so if you want to sample more than what's offered in one line it helps to have a friend to wait in another line for you. The advantage to this is that by streamlining the ordering and preparation process the lines do tend to filter through reasonably quickly so even if you go alone it shouldn't take terribly long. 

The adobada is without a doubt my personal favorite, it's hard to go wrong with grilled pineapple and smokey & sweet seasoned meat but most of their tacos are delicious, well seasoned/sauced, and interesting. The tongue tacos are also quite good. Definitely get yourself some grilled green onions and peppers, which are yet another line but usually quite short.

Sit underneath the stuffed cow head for good luck or to contemplate cows and stuff while stuffing your face with cow...or pork...

1) Learn Spanish or bring an amigo who does. They seriously do not speak English here. I am not very good at Spanish so I had to communicate through a series of grunts and broken Spanish phrases that had nothing to do with ordering food.

2) Stand in the different lines based on the different type of tacos you want. You order your tacos and then after you get them you bring them all up to the cash register. Grab the condiments, limes, beets, etc. on the side next to the soda fountain. Order a cup of horchata to help wash down the tacos. 

3) Get the loaded carne asada fries. These things are amazing and ginormous. Please do not get one to eat all by yourself. You need at least 3 other friends to eat with. You may pass out or hurt yourself while operating heavy machinery.

I got one carne asada taco and one adobaba taco. Many of the reviews said the carne asada taco was flavorful and delicious when to my dismay....it wasn't THAT good as I thought it would be. The meat was bit different than it was over in TJ and it definitely was bland. The guacamole didn't help it at all so I was saddened.

However the ADOBABA taco....WAS to die for! I loved every bite of it so much that I went back for a second one. Trust me, if you got adobaba tacos, you will not be disappointed. It's spicy and just perfect for your tastebuds.

I was going to get the carne asada fries, but after trying the taco, I wasn't going to get it and besides it costs 10 dollars to get it. o_O

Just get the adobaba tacos, do not miss out on this-

I had a Taco De Asada (steak), Taco De Buche (pork), Taco De Adobada (spicy pork), and half an order of Adobada Fries. The Asada was nothing too special; your normal asada from any mexican restaurant.  The Buche was labeled as pork, so I was surprised when I bit into nothing but pork INTESTINES! It was surprising, but I LOVE pork intestine. Extra plus for that pleasant surprise! =]  Finally, their Adobada is DELISH if you can handle a little bit of spicy. They cut it off a huge slow revolving chunk of pork, and serve it to you. YUM!

As for their service, as I walked in, the place was PACKED. The servers were helpful and made the food on the spot as we ordered. When we approached the cashier, you can get your fixing of sides (limes, etc). All the tables were taken when we paid, so my party and I looked around. A group left as they saw us waiting for a table, and a worker walked straight over to clean the table for us! That's faster service than any other restaurant I've seen (high class or fast food alike!).

I will definitely come back, but since I live on the southwest side of town, coming here was quite the journey. Of course, it was worth it! =]",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,1,0,5,eU_88EpbHLPa807YVDySpQ

I have had the tacos adobada and the carne asada tacos. Words cannot express how delicious the adobada tacos are. The description says ""spicy pork"" but I do not find the meat to be spicy at all. The pork comes off a huge piece of meat that is hung rotisserie style and then carved by hand onto a corn tortilla. This is topped with a green sauce and cilantro and pineapples (upon request). I don't know what is in this green sauce, but it is beyond delicious. I think the sauce and meat combination is out of this world. I really cannot up-talk it enough. 

The tacos are slightly small, so I suggest ordering at least three.

Yes, THEE best! Just when I was convinced that the taco game sucked in Vegas, I found Tacos El Gordo and all my taco dreams came true.

Some people might not know how the ordering here works, so here are some tips. First, you order and wait to pick up your food, then you pay at the cashier. Depending on the type of meat you want, you have to stand in that specific line. Once you have your food, you go to the cashier where you pay. The soda machine is on the opposite side of the cashier. Tables could be hard to find, so when you see an open table you better go grab it. This place is popular all times of the day, so don't wait for the crowds to die down or you will never get to eat. If you have multiple people in your group, have one person can stand in each line and then one person save a table. Now that's teamwork!

-Al pastor is the fav here. It's not my usual taco order, but when I am here I get the Al Pastor. Make sure you get it with everything on it. Ask for pineapple, mmm! I ordered 2 tacos on corn tortillas. Also I am not usually a corn tortilla kind of gal, but from here.. Yes! 

-Carne asada was amazing as anticipated. I ordered tacos and the fries-- best decision I've made all week. Ask for peppers on the side. The carne asada fries reminded me of all my favorite spots back in SoCal. This place hits the spot.

Protip-- ORANGE BANG. Unlimited refills of delicious orange bang. Reminds me of my childhood in LA! They also have horchata and tamarind. I can drink a kiddie pool full of orange bang. No shame in my orange bang game.",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,17,13,5,1wewP9f1C0eaop6j5Qm9cw

You will have to wait a hot minute for these so grab a tray and promptly move left/down the counter to order other stuff. I love tongue tacos (lengua) and head tacos (cabeza). I usually get one of those with a mula of different meat. I prefer mulas with flour tortillas and tacos with corn. After you order stand back and wait attentively for your items. After your tray is complete take it to the cash register. Ask for a small drink and fill it with orange bang. You will need many napkins and a fork.

Also got a carne asada mulas, which was equally amazing.  I could've eaten two more of each they were so good.

The ordering system is indeed flawed, and I almost want to take a star away just because of that.  There is nothing that prevents someone from getting their food, eating it, and not paying.  If I were the owner or manager of the restaurant I would fix that immediately.  Furthermore, there are three separate lines that list various meats and types of food (mulas, quesadillas, sopes, tacos, etc.)  There really is no order whatsoever.  For instance, what if I want a carne asada mulas?  There are two signs in different lines.  Extremely confusing.

They do have a variety of different meats. I've tried the spicy pork, which I think they are famous for, and the carne asada but they have a bunch of other stuff. The spicy pork is SPICY, but different in a good way? I'd try it once, and go from there.

There are two things I could eat everyday and as non-foodie as it may sound they happen to be Mexican food and NY style pizza. This place was hands down one of the best Mexican spots I have been too!

The restaurant appears chain-ish at first glance and looks like nothing special. However, the charcoal smell looming over the parking lot is your first hint that you are in for the real deal.  The setup is order yourself, pay and eat; simple and perfect.  

I apparently signed up for my own eating contest because I ordered 2 pork, 1 lengua, and 1 cow brain taco (don't know the Spanish term..I can hardly ask for agua), annnd split the carne asada fries - unbelievable!  The pork tacos were hands down the best I have ever had!!  They are shaved right from a slab of meat as the orders roll in so it appears in strips as oppose to the chunks/cubes or ""flakes"" as you may be use to.  Its appearance oddly reminded me of pork in a Chinese restaurant. The lengua was fresh, tender, and just right. The cow brains, don't judge me,  I was trying for the first time. I thought them to be more tender and even better than the lengua!!  One aspect of the tacos that made them so good were the toppings they are loaded with the best ingredients and ""salsas"" which only my pics can properly describe.The carne asada fries (also have pork option) were amazing! They are very similar to McDonald cut and tasting fries, which I secretly love, and the fresh cooked steak was nearly infused with smoke from the fresh charcoal grill it was cooked on. 

This is not a hoity-toity Mexican restaurant so keep that in mind when considering.  Most of the places I frequent that have the best Mexican you can get a few tacos and a pair of cowboy boots if you wanted.  They are hole in the wall places that dish up awesome food.  This is one of those places (minus the boots) and it is a must have if you are an authentic Mexican lover like myself.

I ordered the adobada fries the first time around, and was not impressed. The fries were soggy, and didn't hold up well to the mountain of toppings that were piled on top. In my opinion, the fries need to be crispy so you can pick them up and eat them like nachos. I also ordered no sour cream on my fries, and somehow my order arrived with extra sour cream.  Since I had waited almost 20 minutes for the fries, I didn't feel like waiting even longer by sending them back. Instead, I tried to eat underneath the sour cream  and focus on what was good- THE ADOBADA.

The gentleman with the jungle knife cuts from the hanging pork with precision. I decided to try the tacos this time around. With a few quick strokes, the perfect amount of pork falls into two corn tortillas and the choice is yours on what comes next. You can add cilantro, onions, salsa, avocado, and pineapple. I chose to skip the avocado sauce-- as it is just too runny. I would prefer real slices of avocado rather than this watered down version of green goo. I am not a huge fan of pineapple, but somehow this could be the best thing that ever happened to a taco. The flavor combination will make your head spin. My only small complaint is that the salsa is too mild for my liking. I was in a hurry, so I forgot to get one of those roasted jalapenos off the grill. 

This place doesn't offer rice or beans, but with tacos this good -- I honestly didn't miss them. The tacos were $2.00 a piece, and I put down three with relative ease. On a good day, it would probably take 4 or 5 to fill me up, On the other hand, I probably shouldn't be eating that much anyway - TAKE IT EASY FAT BOY!

He was originally from Mexico City and hadn't had a good taco that he didn't have to make himself for quite some time.  I brought him here to Tacos El Gordo and he was absolutely amazed.  He said the tacos here were the best hes had since he was back visiting family in Mexico.  Personally, I've only had tacos like this on a shopping expedition of sorts in Tijuana but I'd have to agree that these tacos are pretty awesome.

While the price of the tacos is a bit high (even more so when compared to the price in Mexico ;-) ) they're really tasty and you'll definitely come back for more.  A Taco runs about $2.00.  Small price to pay for a piece of happiness.

Bring your appetite and leave happy.  They're open late and are very quick.  The service is friendly and while there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the way their counter is set up, walk right up and get yourself some tacos!",lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,1,1,4,eE2mhROgjlHbLzPJrA5SVA

Thankfully Tacos El Godo has all their tacos for 2 bucks, their quesadillas for 4 and horchata for 1.40. Usually shady taco places skimp on their meat, but no way jose, this place gives you enough carne asada in one taco to make two tacos. My friends got their famous pork adoabab tacos, which they couldn't stop raving about. From about 1-4 am on the weekend, this place has huge lines, but they move quickly. They have separate lines for the types of tacos you want, so make sure you get in the right one. I ate here 5 times during my 4 day stay in Vegas, and it never got old. The guac/tomoatoes/onion combo that they put on your tacos is superb. Also they have steamed vegetables/onions/peppers that are free, but you have to as for it with your meal. And you might as well get the horchata while you are here - because the food is spicy as it gets...you will need something to cool off.",6p1NDChnIpGl29Ce3cMKWg,0,0,5,UQmGiXumugG_MuJ4DoIQYg

I like the ordering process. You go and order your food from the front counter, where they have different people making carne, pork and other types of tacos, sopas and tostadas. You shimmie your way to the different sections to order the type of meat you want. I just point at what looks good and tell them I want everything on it. It usually turns out good for me, except for the fried  cow-guts taco I got. It looked like a tasty type of meat, but was a little fatty and too chewy for me!

Went to the Charleston location and made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was over an hour, and we had to make friends with people that were already eating to secure a table for when we got our food. BUT it was well worth it! 

Here's what we got:
Carne Asada tacos-average. I think they only had it on the menu to offer something familiar to the people that usually go to robertos
Lengua (tongue) tacos-very tender and beefy flavor
Tripa (intestine) tacos-fried and crunchy, a little greasy, tasted like pork rinds. Good, but are probably better after a night of drinking
Adobada (marinated pork) tacos- delicious. The green sauce on it made it so much better
Adobada quesadillas- same as the tacos but with melted cheese. Good, but I could have done without
Suadero (beef) tacos- by far my favorite. Whatever they marinade/season/cook it in is amazing

There are 3 lines and each one only makes specific items. One strictly for adobada and the other 2 have a mixture. You order/pick up your food at the window cafeteria style and take it to the left to pay and get drinks. The employees hustle. They definitely have a rhythm about what they do. We spent quite a bit, but as you can tell,'we tried a lot. If you go in knowing what you want, it's pretty reasonable.

          Some of the best tacos I've had in a long time.  I had the cabeza, carne asada tacos, and a half cabeza/half carne asada order of $10 fries! Yes, their fries as $10!! 
     I thought that the cabeza tacos were better, the meat very soft and a little slimy? typical of this type of meat, seasoned to perfection.  I don't konw if it was my particular batch of carne asada, but it was way too salty.  The tortillas are made of yellow corn, and are delicious.  They add avocado to their carne asada tacos, but not to the cabeza, apparently this is ""tijuana style"".  You also get a side of grilled onions and yellow peppers, they are delicious with the tacos.  Their order of fries are quite large and they are generous with the meat, however I didn't think they were worth the $10. They add avocado, cheese and cream to the fries, I uploaded a photo of these. 
    Their customer service is great, they are all very nice, the cooks and the cashiers.  They knew that it was my first time there, and they were very helpful in helping me decide what to order.

Everything is prepared fresh in front of you (meat, tortilla). You get in line according to what meat you want on your order (there's carne asada, lengua, cabeza, adobada, buche, and tripa). Lines can get pretty long around lunch time; I recommend you go in the late afternoon or late non-weekend evenings. If you want different meats, best method is to divide and conquer. Have friends order in the other lines while you wait for yours! 

Carne asada and al pastor are the meats I always go for. Tortillas are thick to avoid ripping since the meat is so juicy (plus you'll probably be adding tons of salsa). You can choose to add everything to your order; everything meaning guac, onions, and salsa. Radish and lime are at the side bar.

Unique here is what they call ""Campechana Fries"" ($10), which is Carne Asada and Al Pastor added together! Super delicious. Fries were not soggy at all and meat was tender and juicy. Highly recommend this option if you're not into the whole finger food ordeal! *Campechana fries can come with or without chili cheese*",LoPukvaiiG01I6STvU2fYA,6,5,5,1XDfD_CB1FhHaFQOc1rgTg

WHEN: I believe it's open until 3 or 4am. If you land there within that time frame, be sure to call them and ask beforehand! Please and thanks =).

WHY: Tacos, tacos, and more TACOS!

WHAT: While at work, my co-workers and I were talking about how hungry we were! One of my co's mentioned that she went with another co to a Mexican spot the other night, and also mentioned how delicious it was! I automatically hopped on that conversation and asked what this wonderful place could be!

Then and there, I felt like I was deprived of life because I haven't really tried a real Mexican spot besides Roberto's Tacos (don't get me wrong, I love late night cravings and journeys to Roberto's, but I have found another spot to satisfy these random cravings). So, after all this talking, we decided to take ACTION and eat there after our shifts!

This was a really different environment!! When I walked in with my co's, it was packed! There is an Order station where you order the types of taco's you would like. Tacos are 2 bucks each- totally worth it!

I tried:
Cabeza taco (beef head): First timer, but it was way good!
Adobada taco (marinated pork): I have never had adobada anything, and I have come to find that adobada should be in EVERYTHING! lol.
Asada taco (steak): I love carne asada, so this is a no-brainer! DELICIOUS!
Adobada fries: I ordered a box to take to-go for my family! I had to take a bite out of it too, and it made me fall in love with Mexican food!

Yes, this is exactly how I felt after eating at Tacos El Gordo for the first time. These tacos hit the spot and definitely put me in a food coma not too long after!

I've lived in this crazy city for four years now and I'm JUST trying this place out! Tacos El Gordo did not disappoint. 

If it's your first time here, prepare to be overwhelmed. The organization/set up of this joint could use some improvement, but the staff here is efficient and keeps the lines moving. There are three separate lines for the different types of meats offered, so make your decisions quickly because the lines grow fast! 

The fan favorite (and my favorite) is definitely the Adobada Al Pastor, or spicy pork. Similar to shawarma, the marinated pork is placed on a vertical spit and freshly sliced into your tortillas as you order your tacos. The meat is moist and packed with flavor! The sauce they put in the tacos compliment it really well. Squeeze a little bit of fresh lime on top and call it a day!

My girlfriend and I also shared a half order of the Adobada Fries. The portion was huge considering it was a half order. We barely made a dent in it. They were just OK, nothing like the tacos. They were lathered in sour cream, shredded cheese, and topped with a heaping amount of guac.

Seating here is very limited, especially on the weekend. If there are a few extra bodies in your party, I suggest that one of you snag a table (or attempt to) while the others wait in the lines to order grub!

The latter is juicy shreds of pork sliced off of one of the biggest vertical kebabs I've ever seen and then drenched in a day-glow green sauce.

Get in the correct line for the type of meat that you want. So far I've tried: 

Al pastor (5): amazing! Right off the trombo, the meat is moist and flavorful. The dress up the tacos properly. Just get everything on them. 

Carne Asada (5): again, moist and flavorful with a slight char. Tostadas are crispy with their handmade tortillas and the fries are nice and cheesy. 

Chorizo (3): im normally a huge fan of chorizo but this is the only meat that I had that I thought was lacking a bit. Still decent flavor but I thought it was a little too moist. Almost just like ground pork. 

Cabeza (5): super tender, like melt in your mouth tender.

I'm not talkin' about your gourmet fish tay-co or the horrid generic ground beef. No, no, no..

Notice that big chunk of inverted curvy red meat rotating at a smooth, cool pace? She's with me. Her name is Adobada. She's pork cooking rotisserie style, beautifully marinated in a spicy 'red' chili sauce.. tossed on a corn tortilla, doused with hints sweet of cumin, a sprinkle of oregano, grilled onions and lathered with a creamy green salsa verde.  Ay dios mio! The perfect mixture of tender sweetness and spices that kick. Easily one of the best tacos I've had to date.

This isn't the only thing they serve, of course. What's neat is they have it set up almost like a cafeteria / buffet, in the sense that you can get in a line for an Adobada taco then walk over to another line and grab some carne asada fries.

You see them cut up the meat in front of you similar to how you'd see shawarmas prepared. Meat is full of flavor and moist. 

I've also had the lengua and the carne asada. Carne asada is fine, it was slightly on the burnt side for me and the lengua was meh. I'd recommend getting the al pastor over anything else.

Next time I have got to try the mulas, which are like mini quesadillas sandwiching your taco of choice. I heard great things about it after I ordered.

The al pastor was the most wonderful tasting thing of my whole trip to Vegas except it took 45 minutes to get through the al pastor line. The lengua was also tender as well.

Couple of things, the tacos were too good. You can also order flour tortilla tacos where the tortilla I think is warmed up first. It seems that you get more meat when you get flour tortillas.

But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.

The adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.

And, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.

The suadero tacos was a bit on the dry side, so not that good. I also tried the pork stomach (I forget the name they had on the menu)... it was soft and tripey, if you like that kind of texture, but the flavor wasn't very strong.

4 to 5 tacos is enough for a whole meal, and with all the different meat choices, works well to give you a good variety. Next time, I'll definitely try the asada fries and the chorizo taco (the chorizo taco menu item is easy to miss).",t4WOXuh7u3Y7339nZv99pA,0,0,5,X5-MdJzqwKcsawIcVoGPtA

The lines would move so much quicker if they had people in the back cutting up said meats while 4-5 counter people take orders. Nope, they think having 1 guy handling each specific meat and 1 guy handling sides (grilled peppers, onions) is the way to go.

Well, it's not. It's a huge and annoying clusterf**k of people in line. It just makes no sense. Then, I wanted to buy an agua fresca, but no one told me how to get a cup. What? I ended up with a can of Coke.

When we walked in, there is an about 15-18 foot long grill station behind a glass barrier where you watch several cooks cooking all kinds of different meats and things. A bunch of us were just standing randomly so a cook yelled out to us in Spanish to stand in one of the three lines in front of three small signs spaced down the grill area, all of which were under a huge menu running the length atop the the grill. Your meat/entree is prepared to order right there for you.  I am a homemade tortilla fiend, the lady sautéing meat was also kneading homemade tortilla dough in a bowl amongst all the grill cooking that was happening. Yes!

When your food is finished being prepared to your specific orders, your cook hands you your food over the glass barrier, you grab a tray if you are dining in, then you go over to a register and pay. You can select a beverage at that time.

Noone skipped a beat being friendly, I really felt like the Mexican establishments back in Texas I have frequented. They will speak English to you, no problem, even I was Spanglish-ing. Lol. There were ladies who were cleaning feverishly tables as soon as they became available.  We got there during a lull, but eventually the lines snaked through the entire restaurant.

Observation #3: The brisket (suadero) was dry. Beef brisket tacos sounds like a good idea and maybe others will like it, but, even with all the sauce they toss on, it was dry and disappointing.

It's very clean and organized. The cooks are very fast and good with your orders. The employees are all very nice.

We got 3 pastor, 2 chorizo and 1 asada. The pastor was definitely my favorite and  probably the best I've ever had. The meat was juicy with a slight tang and paired perfectly with the crispy and greasy, but not too greasy corn tortillas. The chorizo meat was tender and had that fresh off the grill taste. The asada was good too, but not much more.

Each taco costs $2, which in my opinion isn't too bad, considering you're inside with seating, although limited. Most taco trucks sell for about $1.",D6ELe_Gd93ePfAKliNh0iQ,1,0,4,QiANO3AXVckV_NWB4W7G9w

Here is the deal- the food is super tasty.
The Adobada tacos are my fave! It is spicy pork cooked ""gyro style"" shaved off one taco at a time! Was also introduced to a ""Mulas"" taco here. Which is basically a melted cheese, meat of your choice taco sandwich - OMG SO GOOD!

The corn tacos they used were the softest I've ever had. None of that previously frozen dry cardboard tasting stuff.

You can choose from a variety of delicious meats - we tried the beef stomach and pork intestine unknowingly (the man behind the counter only told us what it was after we ate it). They were pretty delicious but I'm wimp when it comes to weird meat. I forget what else they have but we ended up picking al pastor and the chorizo - both delicious as well.

They topped the tacos off with different sauces and gave us a small cut of the pineapple that was roasting on their rotary grill on one of our tacos. :)

Those mulas. Who doesn't love fresh tortilla with griddled cheese?

Adobada is what they are famous for. Get a mula with adobada. Double win.

Maybe it's just me, but horchata on a fountain just doesn't taste good. I found it terrible, but I've only had fresh horchata at little mom and pop shops.

If its your first time here, it could get pretty confusing but there are 3 separate lines for different kinds of meats so make sure you read the signs. You line up and then order once its your turn. Guess what? Guacamole is FREE. Well... I wouldn't call it Guac, its more of just avocado but still! Other places would be charging you $1 or more for some guac. I would definitely pass on the carne aside fries, its missing a bunch of pico. 

After you get your order, you pay. About $2 for tacos is a bit on the pricey side since i'm so used to taco Tuesday but they were worth it!

So we ordered 12 tacos and a large order of carne asada fries and were given 4 small sauces... when we asked for more sauce they said 1 sauce for fries and 1 sauce per 4 tacos. Not sure how they came to that conclusion because my sister loves putting sauce on everything, but they wanted to charge us $0.50 for each additional sauce. No thanks. 

Horchata was decent. 3 tacos definitely wasn't enough for me because they're small so I would recommend getting 4 or 5. Also DO NOT GET THE FLOUR TORTILLA. The corn tortilla tasted amazing.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,2,4,mqESot-BC0BUcdwqa_SqfA
3029521,2013-06-11,0,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"Not doing it for me. At least just me for the great reviews I see here. I am happy to say I did not buy into the hype of everyone giving this place great reviews. This place, for me, is not all it's cracked up to be. Lucky I arrived on a slow night tonight. Okay so here is my reviews of the place. I pass by the place take the turn and walk in. Man that door heavy as f****! The place is spacious and I loved that. I found it pretty cool how they have the meat set up like a deli type thing and the line to pay big as well; I liked that.

  So here I order two tacos de asada and the meat looked good along with the condiments. I was surprised that when he asked me if I wanted everything he didn't put chilly... But I guess you put it aside, but even more surprising than that was the fact that he put avocado on it. I was like, ""Thats a twist"" I was surprised because I do know some tacos shops that do that, but it was surprising because the Tacos El Gordo in the San Fernando Valley, California both inside and the taco truck don't do that. 

  Screw it lets go with it. I go and order and realize the salsas were inside the fridge, I liked that so everyone won't fight in the snack bar to grab there condiments. Yeah yeah I pay and I also got some lengua tacos aside. Now those did have the O.G. taste. As for mine they were more to be desired. I loved that they packed in the meat. Here we go with the flavor detail... Okay. The tortilla used was the yellow kind I like those so that can slide. The meat of the carne asada had a good flavor, but I felt it needed a little bit more of a way to hold on to the flavor of the meat. I added the ""spiciest""  salsa to only to my disillusioned self... that IT... WAS... NOT... SPICY! That blew my mind.

  The thing, I believe, that took off the flavor was the fact that it was inside the fridge. That salsa tasted like nothing, NOT EVEN A HINT OF FLAVOR WAS LEFT! So now imagine this... not your regular corn tortilla with sub par meat with good flavor topped off with boring salsa and flavorless avocado. I thought when they added the avocado it was going to have a kick to it, or if that didn't have a kick to it it would have been the taco itself to rescue the flavor, but no.

  So I'm just sitting there debating if I should have a different one to change my mind. So I do order another one. The tacos are a little pricy only because of my experience. I order one de adobada. because it says spicy. I get the taco and already am doubting it just because that meat is more pinker that Patrick from sponge bob and the guacamole was watery as fuck... Should guacamole look white/green? Not in my experience, but whatever. I taste it and am automatically turned off. Screw this I am not coming again. The only thing I am grateful for is that they do stuff you good and the seating it great. But I am guessing THIS tacos el gordo have there own distinct flavor in Las Vegas.

  The Gordo I frequently would go had the same type of meat, same type of flavor, but the difference between these and those is that when they flip the meat they don't lightly press down on it. They flip it and  to press down on it a little longer to grab that tighter locked in meat flavor. Even if that meat was the same and the same yellow tortilla it would still taste good. But what doesn't do it for me was the avacado and chilly with yellow tortilla that just added texture than a taco. Over there it was nothing fancy just your salsa outside, room temperature; white corn tortilla and pressed down meat and they were GREAT!

  If you want a little taco flavor with new ingredients added go here, if you want that Mexico street vendure/ establishment taco shop go somewhere else. I got full, but not the good happy full. My who'll deal is that this Tacos El Gordo is different than the one I used to go. More pricier, different ingredients added and different flavor because of it. I have ate tacos for a many years and I do acknowledged they all have their own, but they do not steer away from the main point. I expected more thats all. I would suggest Tacos El Rey and Tacos El Torito they still do it for me. Plus they are cheaper.

They have their own parking area but since they are in a plaza, there's also plenty of parking nearby as well. They do have a few tables outside towards the back if all the tables inside are taken. Usually pretty cold inside as well, so bring a jacket at night!

When you enter, you pick up a tray if you are ordering a bunch of different items and then stand in line one of 3 lines for the type of meat you want. If you want a different meat in another line,  then you'll have to go to that other line as well (or have a friend grab it for you). When you got all your items, you pay at the cashier. By the drinks is where you can find the limes & radishes.

My favorite is the lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head) tacos.

Tacos el Gordo is truly the most successful taco place here in Vegas. Would I say they're the best... ehh so so. 

The reason why I did not give them five stars is because of how their set up is. I find it beyond annoying to have to get in line for every type of meat on top of having to wait again to pay. Your hands are full of tacos, their getting cold, lines are always long. By the time you pay, go get your drink sit down and start eating, your tacos are cold. In general I like my food hot I don't know about you guys. 

I always get tacos or half Alpastor fries. 
Sometimes I wonder how cooked their meat is so I always have them cook the meat a bit extra and use only one tortilla. 
The Alpastor fries are pretty tasty just wish the hot sauce was more spicy because I find the creamy green sauce to be a bit too sweet. 
Order the complimentary grilled jalapeños and green onions, they're tasty. 

Over all tacos are good but not the best. Every few months I crave them and every time I go I remember why this place is not a regular.

Wanted tacos.  I saw this place was not too far from my location, saw the Yelp reviews, and headed over. 

I must have hit it at the right time because there was zero line.  I knew from reading I had to order based on the meat I wanted.  I chose then spicy pork and one asada taco.  The meats were sliced, the tacos loaded, and off I went to pay.  Got a drink and it was less than $10.  

Wow wow wow. When I first bit the asada taco I knew I had found taco gold.  I have had asada before but never this good.  Everything was fresh, crispy where it should have been, and soft where it needed to be.  The asada had a saltiness that was a perfect compliment to the meal.  The spicy pork was not blow you head off spicy.  It had heat, but nothing that was overwhelming.  I enjoyed my meal so much that I considered, more than once, driving back to have this for dinner.  After all, the sign on the door says open at 9:30 until late.  Oh, be certain to get your tacos with everything on them.  You won't be sorry.

TACO DE ADOBADA $2.25 - perfect amount of spicyness on corn tortilla  accommodated w/ cilantro sauce, red sauce, & onions. You can also asked for grilled pineapples. 

TACO DE ASADA $2 - the beef was not as tender as I would normally like it but still good! Topped w/ salsa & smashed avocado 

CORN MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - corn tortilla sandwich in a sense & adobada is the same thing as al pastor (something new I just learned)  =P  

FLOUR MULA W/ ADOBADA $4 - much PREFERRED the flour tortilla for the mulas. Such soft chest goodness especially when you watch them press the dough right in front of your face & then cook it on the flat top topped w/ cheese on each tortilla. PLUS I added avocado ... OMG de-ri-cious!!

SOPES W/ ASADA $4 - thick DOUGHY texture hand made corn tortilla  on the bottom w/ crispy corn tortilla on top & asada, avocado, & salsa in between. 

TOSTADA W/ AL PASTOR $2 - CRUNCHY goodness!! 2 crispy tortillas filled w/ al pastor, cilantro sauce, & red sauce.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,5,5,5,5-3IFHLMdIj64mtgVow0Vw

The line with the pork hanging on a spit is for pork adabado. 

The line in the center is for tongue, brains, aka nasty bits that my friends who like their food a bit more ""authentic"" swear by. 

Then the last line where someone is making tortillas is for chorizo, steak, and probably chicken, but I always order the chorizo so no clue.

This taco place has my heart. This taco joint is love. Tacos El Gordo, I can't hold it in anymore. I. Love. You. The adobado, also known as ""spicy pork"" & carne asada tacos on corn tortillas were magical. Granted, we are from Florida and aren't provided true mexican food very often -- but this place was on a whole different level of amazing. My husband and I were smiling during our whole visit to Tacos El Gordo because the food and service were impeccable. I'm glad we ventured away from ""The Strip"" for cheaper food. We got stuffed for $17.00 and it was one of our favorite parts of our trip to Vegas. Thanks so much for the amazing food. We will be back! We already miss the food.

I've been to the one in SD, and just like the one in SD, they have separate lines for each type of taco meat to place your order. My wife and I waited in line for over an hour in SD, but luckily, we didn't have to wait too long this time.  I'm so happy that they have one here in Vegas; I grew up with Roberto's Tacos, but Tacos el Gordo is on top of the taco game. 

The adobada is off the hook! They have a guy cleaving off the meat, and it just looks so fresh! The adobada tacos were so juicy and flavorful, best pork tacos I've had in my life! The green sauce also complements it very well. I'm not a huge fan of soft tacos (prefer the crunchiness of hard tacos), but the meat here was so good that I forgot I was biting into a soft tortilla. For some odd reason, I can do burritos but just not soft tacos haha. I also wish they served Spanish rice, because well, I just love rice haha. But fortunately, no rice nor beans at this joint. They do have fries and combination fries that I'm willing to try sometime. 

Also had a couple of their asada, chorizo, and suadero (brisket) tacos, but the game changer was definitely the adobada. I will definitely be back for those!",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,5,4,5,J_ciGfpKYmPXWMRX_h7y4g

Funny thing is that it kind of turned around. I like most of the other cuts of meat here; the El Pastor, Carne Asada, but my favorites are Tripa and Lengua. Tripa is a must. They get it nice and crispy, almost like chicharrones, and the texture adds so much to the taco. Lengua is really well flavored, carne has a good char flavor to it. If you want, the fries are also a good alternative, like Carne Asada Fries. Lengua fries makes it a little fattier and more savory which is also nice.

No, just kidding. The food at Tacos El Gordo has a completely different flavor than its neighbor, Los Tacos. Ordering your tacos may be a little tricky, but do not be intimated: The cooks speak English too! Place your order and then take it over to the cash register, deli style. 

I recommend the suadero tacos (it's brisket), my favorite. The tacos are small but tasty! They are traditional Mexican tacos. Two homemade tortillas, your choice of meat and toppings. I also recommend the tostadas.

Well, what about it makes it so amazing? Everything. This is not a typical taco stand or a Roberto's that around your corner, this is amazingness in a taco. You start off going up to a different portion of the counter and ordering something that is specific for that portion of the counter. I have tried a lot of different kinds of tacos, but the most appealing taco for me is the adobada taco. The meat is cut off a rotating roaster kind of thing and if you are lucky enough to get it off of it, the tacos are even more amazing. Those are personally my favorite, and I'm sure it is popular amongst other customers as well. They also have an adobada version of these in fries, you know, like carne asada fries, but with adobada, and I perosnally think it is way more delicious, and so if you like carne asada fries, I recommend trying the adobada fries.

Sometimes it can get a little hectic ordering from the counter and it might be a little complicated if you can't speak Spanish, but you should still be able to get away with ordering still. The dining area isn't too bad at all and once you take a bite of the food, you'll be enjoying yourself.

The carne asada tacos were alright. They did not put an actual salsa on them and that would have helped a lot in my opinion. The guacamole was a nice touch. This taco also had a bit of mystery meat in it.

My husband also tried the cabeza and lengua tacos. He found them to be very flavorless.

They do give you grilled onions and chiles and they do make their own tortillas, but the tacos are still very overrated. Maybe we came on a bad day and at a bad time, but still, we've had better tacos.

The carne asada taco was my least fave. They use the less desirable cuts of meat and the presence of connective tissue and other Non-meat parts was really kinda gross.

This is my go-to spot whenever I have that taco jones a-brewing. I absolutely heart this place! I never leave here with a sad face. Why? Because their TACO ADOBADAS are the SHIZZNIT SUN!!! 

There are a bunch of things on the menu, but for me, the taco adobadas are the only things I will usually order. This establishment so far is the only restaurant that serves their adobada tacos (marinated pork) Mexican Street Vendor Style. The adobadas are put onto a vertical roaster and spins continuously to keep an even roast. They're then trimmed from the spit and served on a corn tortilla. IT'S SO GANGSTER!!!

The makings that they put on it are good. They'll ask if you want everything. Everything means onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. You can also opt for slices of pineapple to top your tacos. The slices of pineapple will give your tacos a sour sweetness which is a plus. I do wish that their hot sauce was A TAD BIT SPICIER. I think they need to up their game in that matter. Their hot sauce may not be that spicy, but they do offer free grilled spicy peppers that you can enjoy with your meal. Definitely ask for the grilled peppers. 

For some reason I think the East Charleston location tastes better than the one on the strip. Maybe I'm tripping. I also like the fact that you're in a restaurant where they give you a place to sit and have fountain drinks that you can refill. Orange Bang All Day!!! 

There is great competition out there with some of the street vendors popping up in the valley, which is a really great thing. I've had tacos at these other street vendors that easily gives Tacos El Gordo a run for their money. All in all, Tacos El Gordo is still my favorite. Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere to stuff your face in.

When I finally got to the head of the Adobada / Al Pastor line and ordered 4 adobada and 4 Al pastor  just to have the guy tell me they were the same. Now I'm not Mexican but I have eaten alot of Mexican food and I know that Adobada and Al Pastor are not the same thing. At least not at all the other Mexican restaurants I have been to. But he didn't budge so I just ended up with 8 of the same tacos shaved off the spit. Then my buddy who was in the carne asada line said they had not cleaned the grill so all of the meat had burnt black bits all over it. And you could definitely taste it..... the carne asada was not tasty at all. The Adobada was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Oh and did I mention we had to go outside and sit on the curb to eat because the tables were all full.

However, the food there is pretty good. It's one of the best taco places I've been to yet and it's decently priced. I believe it was a little over $2 for majority of the tacos, I personally liked any of the steak/beef ones as I do not eat pork, but from what my friend told me the spicy pork is definitely one to try. 

The Adobada fries are definitely something everyone should try when they first visit or never had it. It's actually really good. But if you're not with anyone or want to have tacos and the fries, I do however suggest getting the half order.

I'm a man with a moderately respectable appetite (king burger and fries at Fatburger) and I was satisfied with 3 tacos at lunch time.

I have lived in San Diego and visited Mexico multiple times. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican street eats, Tacos El Gordo is the spot. Whether you are a tourist or local, you have to visit this place at least once when in the area. Located next to the Encore, there is free parking either at the Encore on in their parking lot (I visited at 1am, so parking was abundant, but the lot is on the small side).

What I ordered (you can ref pic in gallery):
- Taco Asada (Beef) $2
- Taco Adobada (Spicy Pork) $2
- Taco Lengua (Beef Tounge) $2
- Mula Lengua (Quesadilla) $4 *Flour tortilla, but can get corn
- Fountain Drink (Orange Bang) Free refills $1

I ordered all items with everything, as I wanted to try them as they should be. At first, the portions seem on the small side, but let me tell you, they are generous with the meat and it is filling.

Each item prepared fresh before your eyes. Service was friendly and very helpful seeing as it was my first time there, and spoke enough english to get the point accross. Establishment was very clean. All the meat was chopped evenly and tender. The various toppings complimented the corresponding meats perfectly. The flavors blending together were magical. If I hadn't just lost 95 pounds, I would have ordered another round of tacos, or three, and a few more mulas. Should have probably used a fork and knife for the mula, but it was 1am, was oozing cheesy goodness, and was ripe for consumption so I folded in half like a giant taco and went to work on it. I'm craving one right this moment.

Whether it is lunch, dinner, or a late night hunger fix, you need to go to Tacos El Gordo if you are anywhere near one. Highly recommended.",Cd9hDxynLxzogLrYSw2PFQ,1,2,5,gXzZodO6ZRwvyrL8XIVzKg

3445579,2016-11-24,0,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"4.5 stars. I can't quite give it five stars, but Tacos El Gordo is very good.

Several people had recommended Tacos El Gordo to me, and I was excited to finally check it out. There are a number of tables indoors as well as a small outdoor seating area with heat lamps. The restaurant is also very heavily lit with bright white lights, so you will have no difficult finding it even at night.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there are separate lines for different items, and then a line just for paying at the register. Don't know that this is the most efficient system, but it's what they use. I ended up getting food from two separate lines. No waiter service. Food is made fresh so it can be a little bit of a wait. I forgot to ask for some pineapple garnish, but did get some grilled green onions and peppers (free, but you have to ask for them). 

Most tacos range from $2-4 a piece, and there are a few non-taco items on the the menu as well. I ordered a sope de lengua, plus three tacos (cabeza, buche, and tripa). I'm pretty sure my tripa got mixed up with something else, because it didn't taste like tripe. The cabeza was also a bit gamey, more than I expected. However, the tacos overall were very good. Don't forget to get some radishes and lime at the side bar!

By the way, they also have drink cups and desserts at the register. Once you buy the cup, you can self-serve your beverage at the soda fountain next to the garnish bar. 

Probably one of the better taco places in Las Vegas, though I haven't had many tacos here yet. Tacos El Gordo also has a location on the Strip.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,0,0,4,Noh--hd61cFGCNrH6J66jQ

Immediately I described this place to my boyfriend as the Katz's Deli (http://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york) of taco shops.

Just like Katz's, you get in line for the meat you want and watch as your food comes together. It is almost like dinner and a show. These guys are talented. Hand making fresh tortillas. Chopping and slicing meat. Tossing salsas and sauces onto the tacos. Those guys are good and they are fast!

I tried the adobada and asada tacos. The adobada was beautiful on the spit. The meat is sliced off directly from the spit into the tortilla. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The salsas complemented the pork well. The tortillas were just slightly greasy and cooked from the flattop. The asada guy was busy flipping and chopping piles of asada. Flip flip, CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP. The meat was thin and chopped well. It had a nice grill flavor too. This taco was topped with cilantro, onion, and a light green sauce. It was good but not as good as the adobada.

Unless you don't want it on your taco it comes with onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. I asked for the pineapple on my taco and I couldn't ever imagine ordering a taco again without it! My man had the ""Asada Taco"" and he said for him that was the clear winner. I have renamed the tacos here at Tacos El Gordo. They are now called ""Crack Tacos"". I'm addicted! I loved it so much I asked if we could go back the next day and I got no complaints! The tacos are only $2.00 each. The food is made fresh right in front of you. I thought it was awesome to see this lady making tortillas right in front of me and knowing that tortilla she was making was going on my plate. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. If you want they offer free grilled scallions and peppers to eat along with your food.

I like this location better then the other one. I don't know what it is about the LV Blvd location but it didn't have the same feel and the tourists might have something to do with that I don't know. There is more seating inside at this location as well.

Parking can be a pain but it is because everyone else knows where the crack tacos are too. If you go with a group then you might want to designate someone to get a table.  I can't say enough about this place! Just eat here already!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,18,14,5,1uSf6xNUdikoxbyznWcXcQ

Right when you walk in, you see where you walk up an place your order. Everything is prepared on the spot, as efficiently as a Chipotle assembly line. You see the meats cooked right there in front of you so the aroma is mouth watering. Your first stop is the guy serving up adobada which he slices off a skewer and you see all of the juices running down.

I ordered four different tacos: adobada, carne asada, lengua and cabeza for about $2 each. All of them were generously filled with meat, onions, cilantro and sauces. The corn tortillas are made fresh as is everything else. 

All of the meats were tender and flavorful but the standout star was adobada. I made the mistake of eating that first, and although all of the other tacos were good, they paled in comparison to the amazing adobada taco.

I had the flan for dessert and it was good, not the best I've had but worth getting if you have a sweet tooth.

Fun Al Pastor trivia: The vertical rotisserie that the meat is spun on is called the trompo and the meat is thinly sliced off from the spit.

But as a Mexican did I have higher expectations for this place?  Probably . . . yeah.  I may not love it as much as everyone else but by no means did I not like it.  Heck, if I had only tried the adobado (spicy pork) tacos I'd probably give it a five star.  While we're at it, the tripas (intestines) are pretty damn good as well and I definitely don't mind the tongue either.  

What gets me though is the carne asada.  No matter how much toppings you have on your taco or whether you partake in those chiles, there's no escaping the fact that the meat is just pretty bland to me.  Every single time, whether in taco form or on top of the fries it just really doesn't do it for me.  And it's a huge disappointment because whenever I have tacos I always want one with carne asada.  While I'm complaining, the horchata has tasted pretty watered down to me whenever I had it, although the whipped orange is delicious.  

This is an actual Mexican franchise and it should be commended for having body parts that turn the average person off.  Tongue, brains, intestines, you name it and they all range from good to great with the adobado being the star of this place.  The set up is a little weird for most people and thus causes everyone to think they have to start at the right side thus delaying my quest to get those delicious adobado tacos but once you get through the process is quick enough. 

If you're adventurous enough, come on down and try those tacos you'll never see at a Taco Bell.  If you're not, well then I'd still choose their carne asada tacos over what they have at Taco Bell.",xrK1fNVQMFgAxNHhvyQhgg,2,1,3,HnHkc8gFHaMCK-x_Acx4cw

Their Tacos de Adobada tasted like sex in my mouth. Yup... if you don't believe me try one and try saying it doesn't taste that good. 

OMG if you are on vacation or even live here you have got to come try some of their tacos. I'm honestly not much of a taco guy. I usually stick to my burritos but I ordered 2 Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, 1 Lengua (tongue) , 1 Asada (beef ) and it more than filled me up. 

What makes this place special is their Tacos de Adobada
I know alot of places don't have this and thats why its awesome. 

Here is a tip though. It is confusing if it is your first time to order food here. You go up the counter to order what kind of meat you want with 4 or 5 people working behind the counter based on the meat of choice. Go all the way right say two Adobada tacos. The guy tacos up  right there and hands it to you. I asked for three types of tacos and he pointed down the line after I got the Adobada and so i moved to the next meat lady.",qIJNQ5dyC6g6iIPIUGyVxA,1,0,5,gzPCULBzt3ok86YD7VCdLA

Before you enter, know that there are three separate lines for food. Each line represents a variety of different meats - just take a gander at the sign in front of each window to see if your favorite protein falls under that category. The crappy part? If you want multiple types, then you need to stand in different lines. That's why the buddy system works wonders, especially if you all want a little of everything. Even then we still ended up consuming partially cold food because we were greedy and wanted stuff from each of the queues in the restaurant.

I heard this is a step up from the previous location that had almost no seating. We came on a Friday night and it was definitely jam packed with peeps, but we were able to secure a table for four without any problems. Again, this is where the buddy system comes into play and everyone needs to do their due diligence - it's almost fun how you all need to work together to ensure you don't starve at the end of it all.

I would run down each of the taco meats we had, but the spicy pork, chorizo and asada variations were all delicious. Not only that, they were STUFFED with meat and I had to eat some with a fork before trying to finish it off with my hands. No complaints as every morsel was absolutely fantastic. I do think the extra love and flavor comes from their amazing handmade, in-house created tortillas. Those things were perfecto in my eyes.

One thing that is a must is their asada fries. You're able to get it with any meat, but the beef was fab. We got the large to share amongst four, full grown adults and we barely finished. We were so full after the various tacos we had just pounded that it took a lot of courage and energy to muster up the strengeth to finish this heaping amount of delicious fries topped with steak, guac, cheese, and sour cream. You're gonna feel like you're about to give birth when you're done, but every bite is worth the pain you'll feel after over eating.

Parking is a cinch as they share spaces with a huge shopping center.

This place has seen many people who came in from around the world! Especially Senator Hilary Clinton came just for their food and the Hispanic community. 

They did sort of renovate a little by maximizing seating space and placing the register to one side of the room as the drink dispensary and condiment bar is on the other side making space accessible with no crowds.

They have 3 lines for certain orders that make it productively fast. They do dine in and take out orders. They have a fountain drink dispensary and bottled or can drink vendors too.  If you're a real Hispanic food enthusiast, you have to get their signature Horchatas! Or Fanta sodas lol.  Also, you can't forget the complimentary salad bar (sauces, sides)  and condiments for your order. 

Today I ordered 4 Small Adobada Tacos and a small box of Al Pastor Fries which came out to a total of $17.  

To me, that was way too pricey for a small portion. I do admit the Fries are big for a small order but they are not generous on the Al Pastor meat. I had way too much fries and too little meat on my plate. - if you do decide to go and get their Fries, make sure you tell them to put more meat in the meal.

Good thing I read the reviews first because I walked in and immediately saw the large kitchen counter where you order....there are 3 ordering stations where you order directly from the cooks.  Since I already knew about it, I walked up like I knew what I was doing....until they started speaking to me in Spanish.....then I got a little flustered.

The menu is very simple....there are only a few things you can order and it's printed in large letters above the kitchen counter (see pics).  I decided I wanted to try the Chorizo Taco & Carne Asada Taco....and then curiosity got the best of me and I went for an order of Carne Asada Fries....they are $10 while the Tacos are $2....what does $8 more get you?  I was about to find out.  I threw $2 in a tip jar on the counter in front of the cooks and waited patiently for my order.

The food is homemade and made from scratch right in front of you....including the Tortillas.  You have to grab a tray and wait for your cook to make your order because they hand it to you right after they make it.  From there, you pay at a register on the other side of the room by the door....kind of like a Cafeteria in a Hospital or Convention Center.

My cook made me the two Tacos first and told me that he'd call my name for the Carne Asada Fries.  He asked me if I wanted everything on the Tacos...I said yes even though I had no clue what that meant....after I got the Tacos, I realized that it meant Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole, and Salsa....perfect!

I jumped right into the Chorizo Taco first....it was pretty good.  Good proportions on the toppings and the size of the Taco was decent, worth $2.  Next was the Carne Asada Taco....but before I could take a bite, the cook called my name for the Fries....when I picked it up I knew I was in trouble....the damn order of Fries was huge!  It must have weighed at least 3 to 4 lbs!  Seriously!  (see pics)

I finished off the Carne Asada Taco...which was pretty good.  The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly....it wasn't overcooked and didn't have too much fat on it.

Then I looked at the beast called Carne Asada Fries....no wonder this damn thing is $10....it can feed 4 people!  I knew there was no way I could finish it and felt bad because I was going to waste a lot of it.  I grabbed my fork and attacked it.....basically, it's French Fries (think McDonald's sized cuts) covered in Cheese, Guacamole, Carne Asada, Sour Cream, & some other kind of Cream.  The Fries were cooked just right....not too soft, not overcooked.  The flavor of the dish was awesome.

I gave it my best shot, but could barely finish just under 1/2 of the plate (see pics)....great value though....could easily feed 4 normal sized human beings.

The only gripe I had about the joint was a lack of a Salsa Bar....or Hot Sauce.....I would have loved to pour some on my food, but had to do without...that's what kept me from giving them 5 Stars.

However, driving through Vegas, I did not want to deal with walking through The Strip in 110 degrees heat, so I decided to try their downtown location instead.
 
Parking: Easy to locate. It's in a huge shared lot in a shopping plaza. I found parking right in front of the restaurant!
 
Restaurant: It's so hot in Vegas during the summer, even the AC in the restaurant could barely keep anyone cool. It was extremely packed with limited tables. The ordering process is very confusing. There are 3 separate lines depending on what you want to order, you order first and pay after. The line for their Al Pastor is inside! The tacos are a bit pricey, about $2.25 for one, but they give you plenty of meat.
 
Tacos: I ordered myself an Asada and two Al Pastor. I personally love the Asada, the guacamole they put on it is amazing especially when paired with their red salsa. I like that the beef isn't bland and is salted perfectly. I could eat 5 more of these! The Al Pastor was okay, I like how when you ask them to put everything on it, they throw on the onions and cilantro and their red salsa so you don't have to do all of the work. I felt I've had better Al Pastor before, but this one is decent too. If you want extra salsa, you have to ask for it!
 
Overall experience here was great. These tacos were just what I was craving for after an entire weekend of hiking. It's definitely pricier than the typical dollar tacos I normally get back at home, but it definitely lives up to the hype!

When those crispy buttery pieces of small intestine hits your lips...YAAAAAY! I mean... unless you're weak and can't handle your gut meat like a pro.... Next time I want to try the cabesa and lengua too... but the bf already thinks i'm part zombie with my tastebuds... 

They give you a side of grilled whole green onions (which is like the best thing on planet earth) and grilled whole peppers.... omg my mouth is watering. The fries looked really really really good... but alas, i'm ""dieting"" and i have to not order fries at all costs possible or else i eat them all. 

I'm only knocking off a star because their ordering system is just... how do i say... IDIOTIC. ok  first of all.... you have to get in line by meat options... so... i can't even.... like... WHAT!? what if i want like.... options... I dunno... luckily there was a few of us to split in line... but guess what... no one wants tripe tacos so that line is awesome short... by the time i finished eating my tacos.... my bf was bringing the pastor tacos and i got to do round two immediately! Ok anyways, you get in the line by taco meat... and then you go pay for them at another counter separately.... i really don't see what would stop a taco burglar from just getting in line... getting a bunch of tacos and then sitting down to eat them... but then again, you might get taco karma and only be subjected to gross tacos for the rest of your life or something.",X6YgBU3xkkMuVmb8cXFLKQ,1,0,4,rJ0s2juFCo2b6MRNy99x_g

It's best to come here with a couple of your friends so that you can split up and wait in the different lines for different meats, otherwise, you're going to be waiting in line forever to try the variety they have here. Make sure to look at the signs at the start of each line to know what you're getting in line for!

A bit chaotic like the previous location, but still as delicious as it gets nevertheless. Because we ended up waiting for a full hour for all the food, we definitely felt the need to over-order, ultimately getting almost $120 worth of tacos and fries for 7 people. TACO FEAST!

The taco was very tasty and I ate the onions and peppers almost as a side dish.  Another thing different about El Gordo is that you can get either flour or corn tacos.  I got the corn this time and it was quite flavorful.  The tacos here are smaller than at the other places we stopped, but they are good and worth the price with the vegetable dish.  At $2, the place is on par with the other taco places in the area.

A little difference with this place is that you pick up a tray and place your ordered dishes on it.  Then you go to the cashier and pay for what you ordered.  It's very much cafeteria style.  Last night was quite busy and when our group arrived, we got a lot of stares.

The place is a old school Vegas institution in a not so good of a location. But I've been coming down to this area for years to find places just like this! Yes, it's straight out of South L.A. with all the questionable characters walking around. Be aware of your surroundings, and mind your own business, and enjoy some damn good tacos! The place occupies a old Wendy's and you have three lines to which to decide to get in. There's a line for Asada and Chorizo tacos, one for pastor and variations of it, and another for beef tongue and tripa. Pick one and get in line and the lines are long! It's worth it, and when you get up there you can always ask for something from the other line. The flour and corn tortillas are hand made and pressed before your eyes! The Asada was flame grilled before your eyes and lathered with a guacamole spread and salsa! Knock you out with the first bite! The spicy pork was equally as impressive, and this all left me thinking. Why aren't our good neighbors from the south of us just mass producing such great goodness as this!!

2.  Get off the strip and come try these tacos.  They are one of a kind and well worth the effort of finding a way to get here.  Words cannot describe how good these things are!   Other pros -- the tacos are super cheap - dirt cheap - compared to anything on or near the strip.  They also take credit cards!

3.  Adobada.

4.   Learn to say Adobada -- that's what you're going to want to order!

I tried a variety of tacos.  All were great, but my favorite was the Adobada.  The line for those specific tacos is longer than the rest.  Anytime I'm in LAs Vegas, I will definitely make a trip to grab a few tacos.

4019299,2016-03-06,0,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"Went to Tacos El Gordo tonight.

Anyone whose read any previous reviews know my wife and I are from Southern California so we are constantly on the look out for great Mexican food in Vegas like why you can find in So Cal.

Tonight we went to Tacos El Gordo (E Charleston location).

First you can spot this place pretty easily as the small building is bright pink in color.  When you go inside there is a giant counter, and depending on what part of the menu you are ordering from, you stand in a different line. This is good in theory but a little bit of a hassle, as my wife was looking for Tacos Al Pastor which had no line and I went for Carne Asada which had several people waiting.  The meat is cooked and cut fresh in front of you, and the tacos are slapped together quickly.  I also ordered the carne asada fries.  Once you get your food, you go to a different counter and pay.

Pros:  VERY tasty food made fresh and for the tacos they are not terribly expensive (around 2 bucks each).  The asada fries stood out for me here tho.  Freshly fried fries topped with a moderate amount of carne asada, then topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, cilantro lime sauce and fresh guacamole.  You can order half or full and the full is massive.  They also have a full soda fountain as well as an BANG! Fountain which features my favorite Orange Bang!

Cons: very limited seating for such a busy place, the separate lines could leave your guest sitting with food getting cold while you wait and the asada fries take a bit to come out.   Higher price on some items, as the carne asada fries are $12 which in CA you would get the equivalent for about $8.50.

There's 3 separate lines depending on what you want to order. After you order, you get your food and then you pay on the right. Ladies are super nice. 

I got steak quesadilla but it's very different from Taco Bell which I'm used to. It comes with onions, salsa sauce, parsley, and cheese. It was really good. I also tried taco pork. It reminded me of char siu meat from Chinese food. But also very good.

Now to the menu I order two quesadillas and they only have beef no chicken what's that about, and to top it off they are the oddest quesadilla instead of the quesadilla being folded it looked like a tostada except with a small flower tortilla and a tiny toasted tortilla on top.

4050489,2010-11-12,7,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"I recently took a road trip to Ensenada, Mexico with five other ""Amigos"" for a bachelor party solely for either a good donkey show or the best street taco stands that we can find.  And by good fortune we  pinpointed the best Adobada Tacos during our taco stand-hopping.  Sooo much that we pigged out at this particular station 3 times during our short visit.  

Fast forward to the other day the now, newly-wed guy (i don't know what they call them but he's married now and fucked for life) told me he discovered a place that has the most closest and most authentic Adobada Tacos similar to that stand in Encenada.  Heck yea!

So after a long night of work I cruised down Charleston just east of the strip and from that adventure alone i felt like i was back in Ensenada.  Grimy and full of blehhh with taco shop at every corner.  

Once I've entered I was greeted by the first guy behind the counter, ""What's up my friend!?"" His attitude was so enthusiastic that I felt welcome in a surrounding that i wouldn't normally ventured alone in. I'm from an Asian decent and the only Spanish my amigo friends taught me are insults that you can only say to your.. friends. 

1st counter-dood basically gave me the low down of how to order.  It's a bit confusing, but you'll first have to grab a red tray and choose your taco guy depending on what kind of meat you want.  There's actually 4 different taco guy you can order from, but seriously, you only want to talk to the first guy because he has what you're looking for. Adobada, son!  

Adobada is pork that is slowly roasted with a red chili sauce, spices, and vinegar.  Kind of remind me of Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork) but without the sweetness.  

You have a choice of corn (double) or flour tortilla.  He'll edge off a few slice or pork and dice them up for you on a flat, table fryer thingy and ask if you want everything on it (onions, cilantro, and avocado sauce).

I order 4 of those as well as a Chorizo Taco, and Beef Quesadilla loaded. All on corn tortilla except the Quesadilla on flour. 

Payment would be best after you received your food, so you can get drinks and napkins.  They also have a side bar with radish and limes to accompany your tacos.  And lastly the 4th taco guy (usually a female) have grilled green onions and peppers to go along with your meal as well.  A squeeze of fresh lime over the taco and you've pretty much got the closest thing to Mexico's street taco's minus the hot sauce.

The Chorizo was surprising not oily like i've had before.  I would consider this authentic too.  Also the beef quesadilla was not bad either!  I love the cheese in the quesadilla!

I'm not claiming any expertise, but this is really good stuff.  My only other achievements are Roberto's, Amigo Tacos, and a few highly overrated, upper scale Mexican restaurant around town.  None worth mentioning.

You squeeze in and get in line by what kind of meat you want: asada, pollo, al pastor, lengua, sesos, etc. Then when you get to the front you let the cook know whether you want tacos, sopas, carne fries, quesadilla, etc. He prepares your meal on the spot using fresh ingredients including hand made tortillas and gives you your completed order so you can pay at the register.

Verdict: I did not know Tacos can taste like gold.

Be prepared to line for a long time cause this place is popular. There are separate lines for different types of meat so make sure you line up for the pork (my recommendation, but generally the longest line). The staff are extremely efficient though. Best go if you're in town.

Adobada: This spiced pork reminds me of the taste of Char Siu (BBQ Pork in Canto Cuisine). The warm juice flows from the pork itself and fuses with the cold sauce; the pork is well spiced and prepared as it complements the crisp yet soft tortilla. The only complain: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SO SMALL. I ordered 3 and still did not have enough of it. Going to get more the next time I go to Vegas.

I lost my memory here I only remember this as one of the beef. (Should be either Suadero or Cabeza) The beef is crispy and is a bit blander than the previous taco. But it serves as an excellent transition taco before the Adobada",Iar_bSSh3IpFl-i-Fc9zuA,2,1,5,MUCvz0YnF8xrEQcLFLVs9w

My Tacos El Gordo experience took just about 50 minutes to get 3 soggy tacos for just under $7 dollars.

There are several lines that you need to be in to get particular items, then you need to get in
to another unorganized line to pay. Oh and those lines, enjoy watching people cut in front of you making it more frustrating. 

The food itself was average. Definitely not worth waiting for.

My freshly pressed tortillas were obliterated by the time I hit the checkout due to the amount of salsa the cook ladled on to each taco. 

Now, to the actual tacos. The asada  was overshadowed by a handful of cilantro and onions, a full ladle of salsa and some green shit they represented as quacamole that was devoid of any palatability. The al pastor was pretty much the same. The chorizo taco was not too bad other than too much salsa and it gave me a rough gut. Most of the meat from the asada taco was gristly so I ended up pitching it in the trash along with the two other worthless tacos.

I can't really say the tortillas were anything special other than they are pressed there right in front of you. I do know after all the salsa that is dumped upon the tacos, and after about 5 minutes, the tortillas are useless as ingredient-holders, and you are left with a taco mess.

Pack a fork (and possibly your firearm and ccw), pay with cash and be prepared to wait a while if you venture out on the weekend.

Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana import by way of California that's slinging some of the best street tacos around. I visited the Strip location once a couple years ago, but in comparison to some other taquerias, it's not as convenient for me to visit either that restaurant or the one here on Charleston. Not to mention the prices here, which are equal to if not higher than the others, with sales not ever appearing (at least to my eyes or ears). But if you want delicious tacos with all the proper fixings, and price isn't too big a concern, then choose these guys.

Like some of its close competitors do (or used to), Tacos El Gordo has a system where you order first, then pay last. The meats are divided by station, with asada taking up a huge grill to itself on the left, al pastor (adobada) occupying a vertical spit to the right, and the rest of the meats enjoying a bath or sauna in the center. You may have to line up 3 times (and you probably should), so it's nice to bring friends. Luckily, they work quickly enough that I was able to handle it myself during Monday lunch rush.

I tried all of the meats in taco form, and I will list them from best to worst (per my impression):

Asada ($2.25): I used to think Taco Tijuana had the best asada, but this is on par and perhaps even better. With the pico and guac, this beef is juicy, acidic, and just so freaking good even when it gets cold after you've been waiting in lines. It might be just a touch salty, but that's nothing a slice of radish or two can't take care of.

Al pastor ($2.25) was excellent, just a touch shy of my favorite (ever / in town). The dude actually waited for the vertical spit to turn to just the right spot to cut the caramelized meat. Make sure to get the pineapple, complimentary and available upon request. They're a must-have topping, and they lend the perfect sweetness even though these relatively large slices were a bit clunky.

Buche ($2.25), flavorful, tender pork stomach (not belly) served with red sauce. This is at least as good as what I used to consider my favorite buche in town, but I felt that I was able to taste more of the pork here.

Lengua ($2.40): I confused this with the cabeza at first, but this is definitely the superior head meat. This beef tongue was flavorful despite it being one of my last bites of the meal, and the green tomatillo sauce is the perfect acidic complement. it's certainly one of the better lengua tacos around town, and although it comes at a premium, the price is not _that_ much higher.

Suadero ($2.25): beef shoulder, served with red sauce. It's pretty salty and a little dry/tough, but the marinated flavor and meatiness make this a great option. As with other salty dishes, a bite of crunchy radish (available at a cart near the fountain drinks) helps to take away the edge enough.

Tripas ($2.25): crispy fried beef intestine w/ red sauce. It's definitely overly salty/intense. While it's serviceable, it's not one of the standouts here. There are at least two local taco places that have better tripas.

Cabeza ($2.25): cow head meat with tomatillo sauce. It's tender, and while the first bite was delicious, the rest of it fell flat as I've noticed cabeza sometimes does. Perhaps it was lacking some of the fatty, cartilaginous pieces that would make this a standout.

Cesos ($2.40): cow brain, served with tomatillo sauce. Subtle flavor that I could just detect. I know it should be soft, but this one was a little on the mushy side. This texture concern and the extra cost are why I'd say it's the least desirable meat here, but it's still worth a try if you have the stomach space.

For delicious Mexican street tacos, Tacos El Gordo really should be at the top of your list. Assuming I get a taco craving and don't wanna wait for special sales, this would be my first recommendation for tacos in general, and for asada and buche in particular. Choose this location if you're in the area or otherwise really wanna avoid Strip traffic.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,11,8,5,Kz1fJ6EhhUV15O5eecfZHA

The perfect meat is then topped with onion and cilantro as well as this delicious, spicy, avocado sauce. This is all you need in a taco. They don't skimp on any of the ingredients! If you're feeling extra cheesy, I would recommend a mulita or two!

Ever since I first stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I couldn't stop thinking of the adobado taco. As soon as I laid eyes on that twirling mountain of spicy pork slowly being marinated by the roasting pineapple up top, I knew this was the one. It was love at first sight. 

I was confused upon walking in though. As an Asian who struggled through Spanish 101, I felt foreign here. Everything seemed so fast-paced and busy. I stood back on the sidelines to evaluate and plan how I was going to tackle my first taco order. 

I stood there, staring at the menu for a few minutes in confusion. Apparently, the counter is divided into sections which serve the particular meat desired. Luckily, English got me through just fine. People behind the counter are friendly and very quick to construct your taco. I wasn't really familiar with any of the meats on the menu, so I just pointed at things that looked good.

""I want two of that one.""
""Can I get two of that?""

Apparently, my point and get method served me well. I ended up with two adobado tacos (spicy pork)  and two carne asda tacos. $2 a taco. Not bad.

These tacos were some of the best things I've eaten in a long time. They were so good, in fact,  that I went back up for more. Authentic tacos made with love; my favorite kind.

I only come here for one thing, the tacos al pastor. Everything else, except the tacos de asada are good, but for me it's al pastor all the way.

I just wish it wasn't on the other side of town! The place is setup almost exactly like the one in National City. The owner is real nice an we even had a chat with her while we were there.

If you've never been here before, Tacos El Gordo is basically like a taco stand and has TJ (Tijuana) style tacos-- small tacos but full of goony goodness!

My favorite is the adobada taco with an horchata and sometimes I'll have a carne asada taco as well. I usually don't venture outside of that because, well, everything else is made from things I prefer not to eat like intestine, ""cabeza""... Uhm, yea, I love my choices lol.

Word to the weaklings to the spicy stuff, such as myself, always ask for no spicy sauce or ""NO CHILI POR FAVOR"" :) Their spicy stuff is pretty spicy for myself, I usually get the salsa verde on the side.

When I see a spit full of deliciously spiced and marinated pig slowly rotating and being carved by a dude with a machete, I get in line. Immediately. 

Here at Tacos El Gordo, there are lines for their different meats: carne asada on the left, lengua and others in the middle, and al pastor on the right. Let's cut to the chase: get in the line on your right. The al pastor/adobada is PHENOMENAL and worthy of an ALL-CAPS adjective. Perfectly seasoned, tender with just a bit of char on the exterior, it's served on a warm, freshly made tortilla. Don't forget to ask for grilled jalapenos, onions, and pineapple on the side. 

The lines are long, but they move quickly. After you have your tray full of tacos (or fries, mulas, sopas, quesadillas, or tostadas), go to the cashier and pay. You also buy your drinks here. It's your typical taco shop ambiance, casual and divey, yet clean and friendly. On our initial visit, my wife and I were wandering around trying to find  seats when one of the workers cleared out a space near the cash register just for us. Excellent service!

Ignore the reviewers complaining about the $2 per taco price tag. Each taco is generously filled with al pastor that is much better than what you'll find at your typical restaurant or truck. In fact, I'd bet that these same reviewers would gladly pay $2 for 2 tacos with less meat (and of lower quality) because it sounds like a better deal. It only takes one taste of Tacos El Gordo's al pastor to know you're getting your money's worth and then some.

There are 4 stations, 3 of them serve different kinds of meat, and the last station closest to the cashier is where you can ask for grilled veggies such as green onion/peppers. 

1. Pick your meat
2. Find the line
3. Get a tray & tell 'em what you want!
(if you want a different meat, go to the next line and repeat)
Simple as that :) 

After ordering tacos, be sure to hit up the last station (usually a lady is working it) and ask for grilled veggies, it's free and goes great with the tacos! 
The cashier holds the salsa hostage in her mini fridge, so let her know how many red and/or green salsa you want after paying. 

I've probably had almost every meat on the menu, but my favorite will always be adobada, it's spicy pork marinated in pineapple.  You can also ask for pineapple on top of your adobada taco.  

Campechana fries is a mix of carne asada & adobada.  It's not on the menu, but you can order half orders of their fries for $5!  For a half order, it's still HUGE!

Yes, loyal taco fans, Tacos El Gordo is an absolute MUST HAVE if you're in town. It isn't too far from the strip so if you have a car, please do bother to take the drive down here. If not, you are definitely missing out!

Warning: you will leave smelling like tacos so don't come in after a fresh shower... Also your fingers will have the taco scent lingering for like the next 7 hours. 

The menu is priced at $2 or $2.50 per taco depending on what you order. You grab a tray, go, and order. On a normal hungry day, I can eat about 7-8 tacos. 

I highly recommend ordering the adobada (aka ""spicy pork"" -- not really that spicy at all, actually) and ask for pineapples on the side. I eat it with the pineapple and it is sooooo good! I do this by ripping pieces of pineapple and just dropping it on the taco lol. I've noticed if they see you add something to the tip jar, most of the time they'll add the pineapple & extras without you even asking ;)

In addition to that, the classic asada (steak) is always spot on! I've explored all the other tacos such as the lengua but it didn't tickle my fancy. Every time I come here, I now only get the adobada and asada. 

The fries are also HUGE. We have shared the fries between 4 people while also eating some tacos. I also enjoy the quesadillas they make here!

There is no way in hell a So Calian would ever roll east on Charleston, look at that tiny beat down location, and say ""oh yeah, I've got to stop here.""  Not gunna happen.

Thanks to Yelp, we got the inside scoop.  There's only one mission you should have - open the door, walk in 5 steps to the inverted meat cone of spicy pork, and ask for quatro tacos while you point to the hanging pineapple being devoured by crimson death delight.  You will require nothing else.

Almost no one spoke English, which was friggin awesome.  I knew, right away, I was in the right place.  Ask to try the meat, and as their machete carves slivers of pig that had been dipped in love, rolled through crack, and gently slapped on the a$$, you'll find yourself slurping back an eighteen inch string of drool.  Go ahead, and try it.  You'll be licking the little Styrofoam saucer, looking like you've never set foot in a Mexican restaurant before.

Ah, I'm just kidding (kind of). But I went here late on a Sunday night because I had taken my good friend from out of town to Double Down Saloon and afterward we were both having those late night, been out too long drinking pains. He said directly to me: ""Take me somewhere that has crazy good, original Mexican food.""

I immediately thought of Tacos El Gordo and it's perfect because it is about a 5 minute drive from my house. When we got there it wasn't too busy so  we were able to go straight up and order. Note that when you order you go to different people because they are all slicing different kinds of meat.

I went for the adobada, of course because I've seen all the great reviews of it. It was so good I ordered two, but then I went back and got another. The sauce on it has such a great taste and yes, you can get pineapples on it, but I do not like pineapples - so none for me!

My friend branched out, got an adobada taco, carne asada taco, and an adobada quesadilla. He gave me a taste of the quesadilla and it was just as good as the tacos.

I definitely will be back to try the other tacos. It's such an easy concept and for some reason I really like places that specialize in just a few things these days. It means they can really hone in on making something really delicious, rather than doing a bunch of mediocre stuff. It's just tacos here (and a few other things), but the TACOS are what you go for.

I will say that once you wait in line for 15 minutes and then pay way too much for street tacos, you are treated to spicy pork deliciousness. However, I think $2 each for small tacos and long lines with little seating is too much for me to give Tacos El Gordo 5 stars. 

I took a buddy who I thought would like it and he wasn't impressed at all. Same complaints as me. Too long of a line, fighting for a seat, too expensive for what it is. But damn, those spicy pork tacos are good.

I was in somewhat of a tie between the other two, but overall both were so good! I love that the toppings come on the tacos and there's plenty of fresh limes available.

4558259,2011-07-09,1,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"Man, I love tacos. One day I decided that in order to find the best tacos in Las Vegas, I needed to eat at every highly-reviewed taco place in town. I started off at Los Tacos on Sahara, as it's closer to my side of town and consistently the best place to get delicious food. I love it there, but we're not talking about that right now...

I finally made my way to Tacos El Gordo after hearing increasingly good reviews about this place. I'd love to tell you not to listen to the hype, but LISTEN TO THE HYPE! THIS PLACE IS GOOD!

First of all, you should know this place is called Tacos El Gordo for a reason: it's pretty much just tacos. Don't come in here expecting a Taco Bell-like menu of made-up ""Mexican"" meals... nonsense! It's just tacos here, and great ones, at that! (It's not really ""just tacos""... they have like three other things on the menu, but that's just because they're based on a taco-like construction)

I come here and always order the same thing: ""Hola, me puede dar cuatro tacos de asada?"" Yes, I ask for four carne asada tacos, and I always have to talk myself out of getting 5 or 6 or 14. The tacos are amazing here. Plus, you can watch the lady make fresh tortillas right in front of you! It's awesome! It really just ups the ante here!

Again, the food here is good, quick, and cheap ($2/taco). And it's extra cool because you can grab your food, then go up and pay for it after. It was confusing at first, but it works. 

My only gripe with this place? It's right next to the classic Los Tacos. I feel that Los Tacos has better carne asada, and their menu is a lot more varied, but it's in a different category. Los Tacos is a lot more bare-bones deliciousness, where Los Tacos. It isn't really a weakness as much as it highlights how basic this place is.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,2,2,5,RtyHd8EzDlZOE8Ksx5JmpQ
4560576,2015-05-22,1,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"The food is so good! but they have a TERRIBLE LINE SYSTEM!!! 

One of the best taco spots I have been to and I come from the land of taco spots.

The parking lot and area is pretty sketchy. Not one of Vegas prettiest places Inside looks exactly like King Taco but instead of spinning rotisserie chicken, they have spinning Adobada. 

Again the ordering line system is terrible. They have 3 different lines for different cuts of meat. So if you want multiple types of meat, you have to stand in different long ass lines. And some people literally order 10 tacos at a time. I feel bad for the Adobada carver who has to cut those orders! After you order, you go to the register and pay. I really wonder how many people get there food and just bounce without paying. 

Taco De Asada - $2 - Steak was seasoned perfectly and loaded with fresh veggies and guac. 

Taco De Adobada - $2 - Pork had a very light kick, not spicy, and loaded with the same veggies and guac. 

Tostada De Asada - $2 - Bascily the same as the taco but you get a crispy tortilla instead of a soft one. Next time I am going to just ask for the crispy shell on the side and get a taco.

Campechana Fries, half - $6 - Half carne and half Adobada, you get the best of both worlds! Fries were soft thin fries and loaded with cheese meat and guac. One of the best Mexican fries I have ever had. 

Grilled Peppers - Free and freaking legit. Grilled soft and tender and so good!

They hide the salsa at the register so make sure you ask for a bunch when you pay. Seems like they keep that under lock and key

I decided to come here after working a night shift, thinking that it wouldn't be busy at 10PM. Wrong. This place was super busy. Before coming, beware of long lines and bring at least two other people with you. Meats and orders are separated into three sections. If you're by yourself, you're gonna spend a lot of time waiting in line and cold tacos before you get to eat them. I waited almost 30 minutes before ordering and also got them to-go, which added about 20 minutes. After taking almost 1 hour to get home, I thought to myself ""These better be the best tacos ever""...and they were!

FOOD: 
Tacos El Gordo offer steak, chorizo, beef (head too), pork (spicy too), and lengua. No chicken. You can get these meats in a taco, mula, quesadilla, tostada, or with fries. I've only had mula's from one place ever so I was soooooo happy to see that Tacos El Gordo makes them. I ordered one carne asada taco and one chorizo mula. I wanted to try the pork and spicy pork but I didn't want to get into two other lines..next time! When chefs ask you ""everything"", this includes cilantro, onions, red sauce, and guac. 

QUALITY:
The meats are flavorful and delicious. Their tortillas are also made fresh to order. You'll see the tortilla lady and you already know when you see the tortilla lady. Although I waited nearly 1 hr to devour my taco and mula, it was worth the wait. 

SERVICE:
Waiting in line is the only downside. I wish they could come up with a better system. Currently, you have to stand in three different lines to order and then pay for your order at another counter.

Apparently one of the GO TO spots in Vegas after hours or during lunch to experience real Mexican  food (not Tex Mex).  This place is in the heart of Eastern Vegas but close to Downtown.  It's a spot I wouldn't think would serve bomb tacos.  But boy was I wrong.   At 1:40am we stroll in with 20 minutes left before closing.  I would think the cooks would be pissed but damn were they all smiles and happy.  There were still people strolling in.  Let me just say the taco meat is amazing. It's on a slow spinning cooker and the guy slicing the meat is precise.  The ratio of meat to veggies is on point.  The food was just right and it was worth the 12 minute drive - speeding through the highway.  I loved how clean and organize this place is.  It's also very clean and the staff are super nice.  I recommend this hands down as one of the true spots of Vegas.  If you are a foodie.  A true to life foodie - you have to experience this restaurant.  The options are amazing (tacos with various meats) and other Mexican staples that will make your panties fall past 12am or during lunch.  This place is famous and I say if you ever go to Vegas go visit one of their three locations.  I highly recommend trying their sodas.  So many great flavors!

Is it 1AM?
Do you have $4?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, drive to Tacos El Gordo immediately.

The first thing you'll see is a massive rotating tower of succulent pork.

Next to the pork is a friendly gentleman wielding a sword-sized knife.

They carve the meat into fresh tortillas while you order. 

All the ingredients seem fresh and unprocessed.

If you're looking to get as fat as possible, get a half-order of ""campenchana fries.""

If you're staying fit, just get a couple of tacos. I estimate them at around 250 calories each, and you'll feel extremely satisfied for $4.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't really have a signature vegan/vegetarian selection to write home about. 

Several of my friends are vegan/vegetarian, and that means I can't go here as often as I'd like, because there aren't any truly delicious options for them.

I got there around 9pm and there were no tables to sit and the lines took up the whole business. Needless to say, it was like the darn tacos were free! I saw a ton of people dressed up and I wondered if this was a pre and op clubbing spot to get grub at? Personally I wouldn't want to show up at the club smelling like onions but apparently tonight were the Latin Grammys. Here I though going to El Gordo was a new prom tradition but I hear it gets crowned at night regardless of the day. I can totally see that given the tacos are delish. Let's start with the Adobada or Al Pastor as I know them by are one of the most popular kind of tacos in Mexico. Right away you will see this huge trompo roasting with delish meat sliced right into a warm tortilla a ""Taquero"" artisan can prepare for you. I specially love how El Gordo serves them with a signature avocado crema sauce besides the all trimmings of onions, cilantro, salsa and if you're lucky and there's still some left, a slice of roasted pineapple usually dripping juices onto the meat at the top of the trompo. 

There will be another line for different kinds of tacos. My favorite believe it or not are the beef tongue. The meat is not chewy and nasty as people would imagine. It's meat that's as soft as American BBQ brisket, falling apart tender. Try suadero, those are soft chopped meat and usually the 2nd most popular taco consumed in MX. 

Finally, the 3rd lane is reserved for specialties to include sopes and chorizo. I don't particularly enjoy chorizo, I like 
longaniza and this chorizo is a bit over condimented. Everything else deserves a 5 star. The tacos are on point!!!",XT06McUUgrEVvkJZyN26WQ,1,1,5,FtxO3R1PYc2VW9v2h1DqoQ

We love Tacos El Gordo and always make it a priority to get some when we're in Vegas. The deduction of 2 stars here is for the poor on-phone customer service and the wait. We had a large party and were hoping that we would have been able to make an order on the phone to come by and pick up. Unfortunately, after calling this location 5 times, we were never able to get a definite answer. 3 of those phone calls were picked up and hung up. So a few of us decided to just gather everyone's order and go. We chose this location because it is off the strip and we had hoped it would have had shorter lines so we can get in and out quick. But when we got there around 6:30 PM, the lines were extremely long and we were there for roughly about 45 minutes just to order and go. Granted we were ordering 70+ tacos and some extra, we still felt like the lines took quite a while for us to get just to the front. I personally don't know how much longer or shorter we would have waited if we were on the location at The Strip. But I have never had issues with waiting in lines for this long at that location. If anything, I always get in, order, sit down and eat, and get out in maybe even 20 minutes. Anyway, the waiting experience here threw us off. But the tacos were still great! Very tasty and a lot of flavor. Love the sauces. I personally enjoy the buche and lengua tacos! Still great to eat even after getting back from the club at 5 AM.

I had lengua, cabeza, adobada and asada. Nothing jumped out as being anything better than good Mexican fast food. The asada was particularly uninspired. I suspect that that the meat is cut into small pieces before being marinaded and cooked. This method sacrifices juiciness and flavor.

Of the remaining three, lengua was probably the best. It'd be nice to counter the fattiness with something more bracing. 

In any event, Tacos El Gordo was fine. I'd go back. It's just nowhere near the level you'd expect from the median review, and nowhere near the best I've had in NY, CA, or even Chicago.",70JHliVId4FzY2_29gocHw,0,0,3,P1Am9MF9LIHPe9htRDbFFg

Tacos el Gordo. Everyone in Vegas knows about tacos el Gordo. It's not your typical restaurant. For someone who is not used to real Mexican taco ordering process, it can be a little confusing. 
There are lines for each type of meat/food items. You order from the person who is prepping the food fresh off the grill. After you have ordered, you take your food to the cashier after pumping your tray amongst everyone else who is eagerly waiting for their food. The restaurant is always always packed because of its popularity . I call it the Mexican DMV. 

Food:
The food is delicious! My favorite is the tacos al pastor which derives from the Middle East when migrants moved to Mexico. (Not a lot of people know this) the carne asada is really good. The food is always made fresh.

Technology optimization:
The restaurant could use help with their technology and accepting payment options like Apple Pay and not charging for the payment method. The cash register is the same one that you can find at the public library. It's 2016 in America, let's move along Gordo!

Overall:

Now that we got that out of the way, the tacos are pretty amazing.  I had the lengua (tongue) tacos, and I must say they were probably the best tongue tacos I have had by far, and I have had quite a few lengua tacos.  The tongue was prepared to the almost-perfect texture, and as my dining companion has described it, the tongue ""was clean"" - pure tongue meat. 

And, of course, the adobada tacos were also very delicious.  The grilled pineapple highlights the flavors of the meat and becomes a pleasant surprise in the mouth.  

We also had the carne asada, which I thought was quite tasty; however, it was not spectacular.  

One thing about Tacos El Gordo is that it is a bit pricey compared to its competition.  At $2.50 a pop for the lengua taco, it is definitely on the high-end side.

I stopped by Tacos El Gordo for lunch and the place was packed, mostly spanish speaking customers, so you know you're in the right place for tacos, but still felt a little bit out of place being the only asian guy there. 

There were several lines that you can order tacos from, I guess depending on meat you want. You can choose from adobada (spicy pork), asada, tripa (tripe), lengua (tongue), chorizo, etc...Fortunately, the guy behind the counter asked what I wanted to order and basically I ordered one of each, just so I know if they're good. The taco is not that big (size of krispy kreme donut in diameter but 1/4 as thick) and only costs 2 bucks each, so it didn't break my wallet or my belly. 

Every single one of them was tasty... yum yum. The food was fresh and flavorful. My co worker complained that they put too much cilantro, but I think it's no big deal. You can take it out if you don't like it. 

One tip for those that like green onion and jalapeno, They have some grilled green onion and jalapeno available as a side dish. Delish when added to the tacos. Also, they don't have to go box, so if you want your order to go, they just wrap the plate in aluminum foil.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,2,1,5,B4QPkmqVEUyidyCYJtqYUA

So naturally, during our week in Vegas, we needed to hunt down the best tacos. With glowing recommendations from friends, we trekked to Tacos El Gordo. Ordering was intimidating at first with Spanish flying across the room. Each meat was sectioned off, so if you wanted to order Carne Asada tacos, you'd have to go to a specific section, and so on. I wanted to try them all, so I went from right to left, with my al pastor {pork} taco first, a lengua {beef tongue} taco, and then finally my two carne asada {steak} tacos accompanied by my small {but still relatively large} helping of carne asada fries.

Tacos El Gordo was well worth the hype surrounding it. There was always a generous amount of meat in each taco, which was balanced out with the onions, cilantro, salsas, and of course, a warm tortilla. I wish I took some more pictures, but I was too excited about my carne asada fries, eep! Lastly, I got a guava juice pop, the perfect ending to my meal and perfect for combating the dry Vegas heat.

As one of my last meals in Sin City, Tacos El Gordo was the cherry on top of my perfect vacation. I'll be back for more al pastor tacos.",-Rd72eWR8WQlC9JZheo7DQ,0,0,5,PaoohQFy_xF2I6iXU9EzDg

I had asada tacos, lengua tacos, and carne asada fries. The steak was cooked to perfection, it wasn't chewy. However, the lengua was definitely my favorite! At first I thought the lengua was going to be a little dry, but it tasted amazing. It wasn't dry at all! I love cilantro, and they gave me a lot on my tacos! 

I got a half sized carne asasa fries, and it was pretty big for it being half sized. For $7, I think it's worth it! My friend and I shared and we were so stuffed, we couldn't even finish it. I can't even imagine what a full sized looks like!

The lines were long for 5pm, but there was advantage to that-- it gave me time to observe how other customers ordered. There are three lines depending on the type of meat you want, so if you have a party, you should split up. Grab a tray when you're in the front and ordering, and take your food to the cashier on the side. They accept cards.

I'm not sure where the sauces were, or if it's even available. They have long scallions (no forks) that you can possibly get from the middle (I'm not entirely sure, I had to ask another customer). I wasn't a fan of these--a little too slimy for me. 

As for the food ordered, the asada was good and I'd recommend the lingua sopes. I was full after 3 items. The fries counter had at least 30 people in line so I didn't try that.

I've been to countless Mexican restaurants in this city, but almost everyone I know would agree that this place is by far the best.  

Tacos El Gordo is he consummate example of a little hole in the wall place that blows away restaurants who charge triple the price for the same meal.  Typically I'd never even go to this part of town (Charleston and Pecos, I think?) but this place makes it worth it.  On a good day you can smell the meat from almost a block away, and it only gets better as you get closer.  

I'm impressed by the quality of the meat and the extra large portions.  My girlfriend loves the selection.  This place has the authentic Mexican varieties like Lingua, cabesa, etc, while most places offer solely beef, pork, fish.  The carne asada fries are great (maybe a little too heavy on the guacamole, but I'm not a fan), and horchatas pour from the soda fountain!  What's not to love!

The only gripe that I can find with this place is that ordering can be a little confusing. There's not really a line..  Or are there several lines blurred into one?  I'm not sure..

From guisados to the taco trucks, to the ones on the street with the ladies cooking on a cart...I miss all of it.  Tacos have been really hard to find in Vegas.  I am personally not a big fan of tex mex tacos...I want straight up street tacos with nothing but meat, cilantro and onions and the occasional sauce.

I've tried tacos at cardenas and I think they are decently good.  When I went to tacos el gordo on a Friday night, there was of course a line.  It moved fast though.  This place is unique in that they have several lines.  Lines depend on the meat you want on your tacos.  They have everything from lengua to tripe to asada to al pastor.  They didn't have carnitas though.  I lined up for their infamous spicy pork line.  When I went up to the guy, I asked for 2 spicy pork and one al pastor...he told me they were the same thing.  I thought that was weird because I thought they were different.  Anyhow, got 3 tacos and asked them for pineapples (complimentary) on the side.  

I went to another line to pay.  Finding seats can be hard on a busy night but people eat fast and you just have to keep an eye out.  I loved the tacos!!  More expensive than the dollar ones I used to get on the streets of LA but they were really tasty.  I loved the green sauce that it comes with as well.  The spicy pork is not spicy at all!  The look of it reminds of chinese roast pork because of its red exterior...but I didn't quite know how the mean taste like alone.  I just know that as a combination it was wonderful.  I can't wait to go back again!!

My friends also got the lengua and asada.  Honestly the asada was not that good.  It tasted like a hamburger to me...anyone else agree?  The lengua was really good though.  It was large chunks of tender and flavorful meat.  When I go back, I don't think I'll order anything but the al pastor though =).",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,1,5,hO2ddGutCXacbcRHPrIQJw
5020679,2017-01-04,7,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"I've been dying to get to Tacos El Gordo since I crossed the CA/NV Stateline from Los Angeles. I just learned they have a few locations around town between the Strip and North Las Vegas. My family here in Vegas, originally from Chula Vista, CA, used to frequent their taco shop on the west side of CV which is currently located on 'H' St. These street tacos are DA BOMB!

As soon as I stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I suddenly felt as if I've transported to Tijuana B.C. (Baja California). Mariachi music, smoke from the sizzling carne asada, spatulas clanging against the hot grill, handmade corn tortillas, and the carving of the shawarma al pastor meat from the vertical rotisserie. My eyes instantly turned to red hearts!

Just look at the photos. Freshly made, straight from the grill, cheese quesadillas and carne asada tacos in street size form. Yes, they are tiny but pack a great flavor! The carne asada meat is fantastic - nicely marinated and finely chopped, sprinkled with cilantro, onion, guacamole, and tomato. Additionally, I like to squeeze fresh lime onto the asada and then top it off with the dark red salsa. Then there's the complimentary grilled green onion and jalapeño. All very good!

The Horchata is great! Nice notes of cinnamon and vanilla in this rice water drink. And there are free refills. I love it!

Make sure to read the menu board and fall into the appropriate line that is responsible for making Asada, Cabeza, or Adobada/Al pastor to place your order. Yes, you may want food from a different line so bring a buddy to avoid a delay. After you receive your food, walk over to the cashier to pay. Seems a little awkward. Just glad it wasn't crazy busy so I could still enjoy the tacos while they're hot!

Quality meat packed into quality handmade tortillas, topped off with fresh vegetables and excellent salsas, at ~$2.50 per taco, all make for a fantastic Taco Tuesday (or any day for that matter)!!",1maoJPTlgljLxbKFJb0qIg,11,8,5,lXMl4rUMgTC2BwZBV6zcyQ

So there are lines going for different things. You go to one line, and then sort've slide down from one to another if you want different things. There is a adobada line (the one with the spit), the middle is kinda all the rest, then the grilled onions and peppers station (gratis with tacos so get some), and then left most is carne asada. It may take a moment if you're getting a few things, or if there is at least a few of you - split up. Since it's the last stop we ordered a few things to get full up. Then you go to the register to pay, get drinks,  and get red and/or green sauce. There is a serve yourself bar from limes and radishes. 

Adobada was good, juicy and a bit crisp on the edges which I like. We didn't get with pineapple but this one was a rather sweet adobada than most I've had, like they keep basting with pineapple juice on the outside. Not good or bad thing, just depends what you're into but I thought it was a solid, if a bit different adobada. Lengua was tender, but was a bit more fatty than average so the BF wasn't fond of it, but it was alright for me. It's like not enough of the connective stuff rendered off so there is a fattiness to it that can be a put off. The cabeza here was pretty decent and we both liked that.  I love they give you grilled onions and peppers. I moved here from San Diego and this was a normal TJ style thing to eat with tacos and I haven't had it since I've moved here. Definitely was a plus for me. 

Now, with a place that is so talked up I expect a lot and while it was good, it wasn't my favorite. And being not a grand slam means it isn't worth the trouble of lining up and then sliding down each of the stations then hoping there is a table open in the constantly busy restaurant (there are a few outside to one side if its full inside). I just get salty at chaos when it comes to trying to eat.  The one time I tried to stumble to the strip location we were a bit overwhelmed and confused (since I didn't know the deal with this place and the lines) so we left. Since it was our last stop too, comparatively the tacos were smaller than our other stops at the same price and the most hassle to get so this would be a plan C for me type place. I almost never want to make it difficult to get food unless it's phenomenal and even then I have my limits. I am not jumping the gordo bandwagon.

I was hoping for some crisp/ char but I didn't find it at this place.  The three lines here were a little offputting for me.  I knew I wanted the adobada tacos (~$2) and didn't waste any time.  I did add an order of the mula (essentially a quesadilla with meat inside) and it was ok (~$4).  I wish the cheese they used was more flavorful.  Make sure to ask for grilled chiles, onions, and pineapples for your adobada tacos.  Also, someone suggested mula w/ flour tortillas tastes better than corn tortillas.  I will definitely be back.

Jasmine went on and on, but how could I resist texts like this?  After all, she's a fellow foodie.  

Let me tell you, all it took was ONE.BITE.  I was hooked.  

Ok, so this location isn't the safest place to head to at 1:30AM, but if  you grew up in my neighborhood it will only bring back memories, lol!  I'm sure you will mull through the other great reviews of this establishment, but at the time I rolled through there (1:30AM) there were five people eating inside, and two vagrants outside asking for spare change.

  LADIES... I highly suggest taking a friend or friends if heading here late at night or before they close. 

That being said, their ADOBADA tacos are just short of orgasmic.  Seriously, if my taste buds were capable of such activity, they did it.  The pork is marinated and cooked just right, with incredible flavor that remained very distinguishable even past the fresh diced onions and minced cilantro.  All of this is succulently nestled in perhaps the freshest tasting corn tortillas I've ever had.  

They do not skimp on the amount, either... they are generously filled!

And what's up with that green sauce?  Jasmine and I agree, the main ingredient in it is crack, because it.is.addicting.

(just kidding about the crack...)

They have locations all over the Southland (LA) and in San Diego.  As far as Las Vegas goes, I will definitely make this a regular visit from here on out.

If you're a fan of street-style soft tacos, you owe it to yourself and your friends to give this place a try.  Go for the food, not the ambience!!

House made tortillas.  Generous portions of flavorful house made beef and pork.  Tacos made to order on the spot.  Fresh veg and a great extra (grilled peppers and onions that are so good, they can be eaten alone).

Outstanding  ""normal"" proteins including:

- Carne Asada - well marinated, juicy, deeply flavored flank or skirt.  Hint of acidity.
- Adobada - The venerable pillar of meat, carved by a weapon.  Mildly spicy, juicy, seared finish adding a good bitter edge.

Offal selections include:

- Cabeza (face) - The best of all the protein selections.  Fatty, liquefied gelatin, moist beefy goodness.  
- Lengua (tongue) - very good beef flavor with a mineral finish.  Excellent, slightly chewy texture.
- Tripa (tripe) - Clean, almost milky with a slight bitter, organ meat finish.  Chewy and tasty.
- Buche (pig stomach) - Not for everyone.  Mild hint of mineral bitterness.
- Sesos (cow brain) - Definitely not for everyone.  Creamy, aggressively seasoned, strong mineral flavor.  In your face flavors.  (it lacks the mild flavor and finesse of a calf brain).

Straight forward, efficient counter service.  Strange multi line ordering system (one line for this, another for that).  Very low prices ($2 - $2.25 per taco).

Notice that this is still a four-star establishment - I still love my beloved Tacos El Gordo - but now I have a few caveats.

1)The last two times I visited, there were men walking around the restaurant and trying to sell bootleg copies of new movie releases.  Beyond being illegal, it was just annoying.  They wouldn't take no for an answer and kept shoving copies of the movie Ted in my face while I was trying to eat.  I think it's pretty incredible that this goes on and no one seems to put a stop to it.

2)Once in a while, the meat in my tacos is downright cold.  From time to time, I get a taco that tastes just a bit funky and lukewarm.  Pretty unappetizing.

3)I'm beginning to agree with other posters (like Misti Y.).... the absence of rice and beans is very depressing.  Sometimes I get sick of just eating taco after taco.  And no, I really don't feel like eating gloppy fries with my tacos.  RICE AND BEANS!  That's what I want!

4)Los Tacos.  Los Tacos has ruined this place for me a bit.  To me, nothing can compare to my beloved LT.  Nothing.  Sorry, Tacos El Gordo.",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,4,1,4,kuU4VdZ4oVDVePojjmHSpQ

It's a taco circus with the cast of loco characters whipping out the finest tacos in the land. Very reminiscent of tacos I have had from many a street cart in the old country. So sit your culo gordo down and behold anything from spicy pork, to brains, to tongue, to beef and everything else. My faves so far are the choritzo and the spicy pork. A couple of yelpers have poo pooed the chorizo, I likey. At 2 bucks a pop, this qualifies as some exceptional cheap eats.

5123795,2014-05-26,0,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"These tacos completely remind me of being in Michoacan, Mexico and enjoying some real home made food. 

Although this locations is always busy, the sheer quality and flavor of these tacos keeps me coming back no matter what. Right when you walk in, the enticing smoky aroma of meat on grill hits you right in the nose reassuring you that you're in for a good food experience. 

The first station you come across is the Al Pastor or adobada station. This is marinated shepherd style  pork meat cooked on a spit and sliced to order. This is actually very similar to shawarma. This meat is the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Neither one of the flavors overpowers the other and is paired wonderfully with some onions and cilantro. Don't just get these as the station next to this is my personal favorite.

The next station has all the little weird bits that completely. If you're a Bizarre Foods fan or pride yourself on being am adventurous foodie, you definitely want to stop by here. Ah yes, so, this station has beef tongue (to die for), tripas (beef intestines) which are very crunchy, cabeza (beef head), and this last one is my personal favorite buche (beef stomach). All of these meats are cooked to perfection and delicious to say the least. I would definitely recommend that everyone try all of these. I'm sure that these bits are something that not most have tried but, they are delicious. Writing this is making me hungry, lol, but on we go!

The final station is another favorite. Carne asada and chorizo (spicy Mexican sausage). These meats are grilled over actual charcoal which gives these meats
 the authentic flavor you must have for these tacos. The indoor hood over the grill is fantastic as the dining area does not fill with smoke like other establishments I've visited. Here you can also get some grilled jalapeños and grilled green onions, perfect combo with anything they serve.

I've only mentioned tacos so far but they also do amazing carne asada fries and nachos,  campechana fries which allows you to choose 3 different types of meats, sopes, mulitas and quesadillas! All should be washed down with a horchata or jamaica which will really round out the experience. 

Recommend this place? But of course!! As long as you're not in front of me that is lol!

Having bookmarked this place for months, it took an entourage for me to have the guts to step in - of which, my brother, my friend, and two Spanish-speaking coworkers were all necessary. At first, I was a bit confused. But read the signs, get in line for whatever meat your stomach desires, and walk towards the counter. It's easy enough, especially when the guys making your tacos are some of the friendliest people (I may be biased after my coworker told me that one was smitten with me).

My brother and I do what we do best: divide and conquer. I grabbed a carne asada and adobada taco while he grabbed cabeza and lengua. At two dollars a taco, these are  completely worth the inflated price - brimming with meat and topped with various sauces. Plus, the tortillas are housemade...that's impressive in it of itself. Add a cup of horchata and our total came out to about ten dollars. These tacos are, in short, legit. Our favorites were the cabeza and lengua, but to be honest, I couldn't really distinguish the two by either taste or texture. Tasty has no distinction in my book. The adobada was especially delicious with a slice of grilled pineapple (be sure to ask for it!). But the let down was the carne asada, which was too plain for our liking. 

If marriage to the adobada man means more delicious tacos at my convenience, I may consider it. In fact, since these are some of the best tacos in the Valley, I accept your offer sir!",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,2,1,5,YCrhOf4cYhdmgdQMFUkt4Q

However, I will say on my first visit, I was disappointed. Why? Because I found the tortillas to have an odd taste. Is it a white girl tongue talking? Perhaps, but they seemed overly sour, and I generally love corn tortillas. I was going to sit on the review sidelines for the Gordo, but a hubby craving led me back. 

On the first trip, I had not known to ask for the pineapple on my adobado taco, and thus, did not get it. This time, I was on a mission for the pineapple, a mission easily accomplished by simply asking, ""Can I please have some pineapple?"" This request made a big difference. Do not skip the pineapple as it is the secret to a complete flavor explosion! I think the adobado may be the best option, as the husband was not super impressed with the lengua. Plus, how can you resist a giant, red swirling cone of pork? 

The resulting taco was a street taco win (not big, but flavorful), and the atmosphere is definitely like a street party. The place is generally always overflowing, and you have to head directly to your meat to place your order. Don't be shy! Everyone is very helpful and friendly. If you don't know what something is, just ask! Otherwise, you may end up with a brain or tongue taco. Yes, they roll legit with the meats. 

The menu is limited, pretty much tacos ($2), carne asada fries and perhaps a quesadilla? There are no rice and beans, and you can call me names, but I love rice and beans and miss them sorely. There are no vegetables, except for a side of grilled scallions and peppers, which I have yet to effectively eat in a manner that contributes to my overall meal experience.

First! You must have the Carne Asada fries!! (A full one if you are hungry and half if your not; $10 well worth the price) they use the real deal carne asada topped with guacamole, cheese, sourcream and their tasty (spicy) green sauce!! 

Sencond, I highly reccommend Tacos de Pastor (or adobada as they are called at this location) the green sauce is to die for and Tacos de Cabeza! Cilantro-onions- red or green sauce- and guacamole.

Third, You have to try their Horchata- perfect finish to the meal! A little sweeter than how it normally tastes but still very good.

I was in total shock when I saw that they had BUCHE as not many places have this particular meat on the menu nor is it ever cooked right.

The carne asada tacos are decent (as are the tripe and lengua tacos), but, the spicy pork adobada tacos are golden. At $2 each, they can't be beat. If you're planning on visiting, make sure to order at least one of the adobada tacos, you'll thank me later.

The service is extremely friendly as well.

Originally from San Francisco, I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to cheap, delicious, hole-in-the-wall taquerias. I almost don't want to admit it, but these tacos are better than any I can remember having in the Mission. 

I almost feel sorry for the taco shop across the way in the same strip mall, ""Los Tacos."" Almost. They're good, but overpriced. I believe Los Tacos originated in San Francisco, around 24th and Mission, and they're overpriced there as well. A single taco shouldn't cost $5+. 

Tacos El Gordo appears to have decimated the business at Los Tacos. It's funny driving between two competing taquerias where 90% of the cars are parked on one side of the lot. If they made burritos, I'd probably cry tears of joy.",6q5-iyuM1aMecYOJBPHHBw,4,2,5,ybo7mhK0Su3Yv-LdB3OIfA

Whether you are drunk or sober, it doesn't matter. I love how this is jam packed & open during early & late hours throughout the day.

* Ordered:
- Small Carne Asada Fries (3/4 stars): Sorry, I've tasted better in Southern California so this is just a good back up for your asada needs. A small is shareable for 2 unless you're drunkenly, hungry.
- Al Pastor Tacos (5/5 stars): SO good, that I wished I got more than 2!
- Asada Tacos (4/5 stars): Squeeze the lime all over & you're good to go. I think picking asada for tacos are better than the fries.
- Horchata (3/5 stars): Too small for it's price, but good enough to wash down the tacos.

- They have a salsa & lime bar

* Concept:
1) Come in, pick your ""MEAT line."" They have specific lines for all their meats from al pastor to asada to pork to beef to beef tongue & more!

2) Ask them what you want between tacos, fries, tostadas, sopes, mulas, quesadillas & drinks. They'll grill the meat in front of you!

3) Take it to go, they'll wrap it in foil for you or dine in, they'll simply put it on a plate hot & fresh for you to eat!

4) Pay at the registers.

5) Finding a table here can get difficult, but when you keep an eye out, people leave left & right here & there. We didn't wait very long to sit down because most tables were in groups. 

6) They have workers coming around cleaning up & take your trays & trash when you are done eating. 

Do not be intimidated by the lines & crowd. For a Friday night, lines were fast, got our food cooked fast, & the only line that was longer here was to pay because they only have 2 registers. This is THE SPOT to eat before, during, or after partying in Vegas!

5297419,2016-07-08,0,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"We had Carne asada tacos. Definitely tasty and flavorful. Tortillas are fresh hand pressed. There were a list of different meats to get (like chorizo, beef head, tongue,  pork etc). I do not think chicken was one. I'm glad I came to experience the food. However it's kinda pricey in my opinion for tacos. We got 6 tacos with guacamole and our bill was $15. Definitely not enough to make you full because they are so small. It was more of an appetizer. So if you plan to eat to get full be prepared to have at least 5 to 6 tacos for one person and pay almost $3 per taco. No burritos but they do have quesadillas and fries. 

Ordering was a bit confusing at first. You order from the guys cooking the meat and pay at the counter afterwards. I'm not fluent in Spanish so it took me a sec to get my bearings and no one was trying to help me.

 I would come back for a good Carne taco to grab a bite before dinner. But I'm not adventurous enough to try anything else on the menu besides the carnitas.",43c4ItmwvBZig53-qN_-EA,1,1,4,BI05bbX1yw0X1hckgkGoKQ

1) DAT SAUCE! The taco Gods were kind enough to share their nectar of life with us lowly beings and not only drizzle, but give this taco a drenching bath in a creamy sauce of deliciousness. I have no idea what kind of ingredients they put in this sauce, but I hope it's illegal because something that tastes this good is pure addiction.

2) SPICY PORK! Meat so huge its as though if you stuffed your face and tore meat from the bone with your own teeth. There was so much in this taco, they did not skimp out at all like some other places. It also had so much flavor, I am salivating just thinking about it. 

3) CILANTRO! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I am a huge cilantro lover and the herbiness with the cream sauce, pork meat, and corn tortilla was NOM NOM NOM! I can seriously ask for a ton more because cilantro is so amazing.

4) The adobada really isn't spicy according to my standards as I have a gazillion spice level tolerance. But, I poured a whole container of the green sauce they have to the side table, and it gave my tacos that extra kick with the cream sauce.

5) LITTLE MEXICAN LADY! How AWESOME & NICE can she be?!?! I called in to pick up 10 tacos for my friends and I. First thing she does is answer in Spanish, that's how you know this place is LEGIT! After asking to speak in English, I could tell that she was super busy with other customers in line. Drove for about 5 minutes, and i was expecting to wait in the store for our 10 tacos, but as soon as I walked up to the counter, she said ""You called for the order Huh?"" @__@ How did she know? I didn't even say a single word to her. Psychic powers? And out from under the counter she pulled the most beautiful plastic bag FULL of tacos already packaged in little plates, foils, plastic forks, spoons, napkins, sauces in containers, and horse radish in ziplock bags! Customer service was so fast, amazing, and nice at 10PM on a packed Sunday night that it made my taco taste a bazillion times better!

I got the carne asada tacos. The taste was wayyyyy too salty and cold by the time I bit into them. Sad to say, I gave the rest to my fiance. It is more sad cause whomever thought this place was worth rating a 5 has NEVER had authentic Mexican food from real Mexicans. As a matter of fact, go to Lindo Michoacan, thats where its at.

It takes about five to ten minutes to come so order that first and get to the second line for some al pastor tacos! Tacos are about 2-2.50$ a piece and I'd recommend about 3-4 because they are quite small. Tostadas are just basically crispy tacos and I personally enjoy those better than the soft tortilla.

       - Tacos - The Adobada and Lengua are two must haves. After that, as long as you steer clear from the Tripa and Sesos, everything else is pretty good.
       - Ordering - You grab a tray and you go up to one of the three guys and order your tacos. Adobada is on the right. Carne Asada is on the left. Most of the other ones are in the middle.
       - Neighborhood - This place isn't in the greatest neighborhood. However, there are mostly families in there and it's well lit so you should be fine.
**Ordered**
       - $2 Taco De Adobada (Spicy Pork) - The greatest taco I've ever had. It's cut from a giant rotating pork wheel. Genius (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=KTg0vlPNZqaZC4m7oh1nKw).
       - $2 Taco De Lengua (Beef Tounge) - It tastes like very tender beef. It's delicious and a must try.
       - $2 Taco De Asada (Carne Asada) - It's good carne asada, but there are definitely other things to try.
       - $2 Taco De Buche (Pork) - Tender, but not as good as the adobada.
       - $2 Taco De Cabeza (Cow Head) - It's just like regular beef.
       - $2 Taco De Tripa (Cow Intestines) - I was expecting tripe like in pho but got intestines. I found out that tripa didn't translate into tripe when I got home. Regardless, I didn't finish this taco.
       - $2 Taco De Sesos (Cow Brains) - This was also a miss for me. 
       - $10 Adobada Fries - Best in a group. Skinny fries covered with adobada meat, cheese, guac, and mayo. It's delicious but will also slow your insides down for the next couple hours (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=h3ntc5q93sgsWcQUOofnZQ).

So they have three lines and each line services different tacos so depending on what you want you may have to go thru 3 different lines. Then you go to the cashier and pay and get a drink also if you want. They do have a salsa and lime bar to help yourself. Literally it was packed with Latinos which meant it was authentic and a good place to get tacos. I was like one of the only non Latinos in the joint. 

The tacos are small but jammed with meat and flavor. Very tasty, wish I could have tried all the tacos. They do have a variety, I tried the carne asado which was tasty and the balance of flavors were right on. I also tried the adobada (spicy pork) which looked like sharma where they shave the meat off very tender and flavorful. I believe that's one of their specialty tacos. The tacos are priced at $2.25 each. They do have loaded fries and some other items.
 
Plenty of parking well lit lot since the neighborhood could be a bit shady at night. There was an armed security in the restaurant which makes you feel better. 

I definitely will go back since now I feel comfortable on the ordering system and how everything works there. 3 tacos and bottle water was a little over $9 dollars. The price per taco could be a bit cheaper in my opinion but way cheaper than eating on the strip and the food is pretty good quality.

The idea of splitting the tacos into groups and getting people to order from a certain person is genius. Instead of one long line, the customer can bypass it and just get what they want before heading to the cashier to pay.

Yet again we were the minority. I am beginning to enjoy this. When the menu does not tell me exactly what I am eating and the other patrons are of the ethnicity, the food must be A1. I came here with my sister and some of her co-workers. Since she is about to leave town, we have been knocking off her bookmarks in blocks. Today, it was time to get some tacos that have united the Yelp world. 

My fundamental Spanish was enough to understand that I wanted tongue and head meat filled corn tortillas. They are definitely the stand out of my meal. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth. No gaminess and all flavor. I could eat a tray full of these alone. Then my sister got the shaved meat and carne asada. The Adobada is just as good as everyone has made it out to be. With the shaved pineapple only makes it that much better. The steak taco was nothing spectacular and was my least favorite. I know now that it is all about the leftover proteins. If I stick to these, it would be a solid meal. Add a horchata to wash it all down and I have never been happier. Four tacos and a drink was only a little over $10.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,1,4,5bR-8UtbLFtXt9XJzonWkg

The one thing I've never had is an adobada taco.  And man it is amazing. The spicy pork with the salsa and sauce they add to it is just perfect. Every bite literally pulls you into the next one. I wish I had gotten 10 of them but I only got 2 so I could try other things. The carne asada tacos were good. We also had the carne asada fries which were also pretty good. But I kept on yearning for more of that Adobada. I'm hooked and plan on hooking as many other people too so that I can enjoy again and again with them. The service was cool.

The tacos are small BUT they pack on the sauces and meat like no other! NOT TO MENTION GUAC IS INCLUDED!!! At least for the tacos de asada it was. And man did they give me a generous portion!

The Pastor(pork) is on a rotating spit with a chunck of Pinapple on top like it should be and it's the first thing you see when you walk in the door.  It has that sweet and smoky flavor any good Al Pastor should have.  I've been suckered into various taco joints in town that had a Pastor spit, hoping that I would find something as good as you can get in Mexico.  I've always come away very disappointed.  El Gordo's has it down.

The Carne Asada is marinated and grilled to perfection.  It has that distinct flavor of the Original El Gordo's in Tijuana.  Getting Asada this good is a rare occurence these days.  I've been all over Southern California and Vegas and I can only count 4 or 5 Taco stands that I've found in the last 15 years that even come close to this Asada.

When I first saw that the tacos were 2 bucks, I balked a little, but when I realized it was the same name as my favorite stand in Tijuana, I would have paid 4 bucks for a taco in hopes that it was half as good as I had remembered it.  The tacos are well worth the 2 bucks considering that they pack them full of meat and will top any taco off with as much guacamole, cilantro, and cebolla you want.

I've only been there three times since I found this place, so I haven't had a chance to try some of the other meats.  I'm sure everything is on point just based on the Asada & Pastor.  Next time I'll have to try the Lengua & Buche.",G6sEUm0N74dcXD9vTduYmg,4,1,5,7BrrZeizHqvFJ2QenmCpzA

The dining  area is to capacity and lines are waiting for about 20-30 minutes. Tacos are always good and good portions are always expected  especially  if you are a person that  appreciates good service and knows how to TIP adequately. Please  Tip these hardworking people  which are all probably  working for minimum wage. 

When I come to tacos el gordo I always like to  order the carne asada  which come with  home made tortillas,  or any other variations  which come with processed  ones.  I had never tried TRIPA  tacos I thought  the idea of trying tripe tacos  was nasty,  my wife being a loving caring wife said try them and shoved one in my mouth and I won't lie to you  ever since that day  I order one or two  of those.  I've also tried the carne asada fries which are OK I suppose  but not for me I'd rather have a taco. 

With all of this being  said,  I miss the location  on Vegas Blvd,  because it  is closer to  home and much  more convenient  that is the reason  I don't come as often as I'd like to.

I'm sure the cop is a good thing and makes customers feel safer going there.  It was kind of a rough crowd the night that i went but then again it was a Friday night around 11 pm.

I would go back but realistically I do not live to close so it wont be happening anytime soon! I only give it 4 stars due to the location and surrounding area.

Walking in, the place can be somewhat overwhelming. There's like 200 things on the menu (ok, I'm exaggerating a little) and you can line up in like 10 different lines. Depending on what kind of meat you want - you go to that line. They cook the meat fresh - in your face. Right on the grill - a few feet away. Sure, this means you will smell like smoke for the rest of the day, but with casinos in Vegas being smoking and all, I rather smell like carne asada than cigarettes.

I got: 

Sope de asada - Whoa! This thing was pretty massive. It was a fried dough (?) with a ton of toppings like salsa, guac, onions, cilantro and of course carne asada - with a crispy chip on top.

Tacos asada - Two tacos with carne asada. Awesome! 

The wife got some quesadillas - they were a little small, but the cheese was so good! I think it was a white cheese for frying. Pretty tasty.

We washed it all down with some Horchata! They have two machines for fountain drinks - one for regular soft drinks and the other one for traditional Mexican drinks! Pretty cool - I would of liked to try some of the other drinks, but was pretty stuffed.

However it was late on a Sunday night after a full weekend of nonstop raging in Vegas and we were on a quest for some sustenance for our 4.5 hour drive back to Socal. After one option was closed and another was too long of a line, Tacos El Gordo became our saving grace. We ordered our tacos on the phone togo as we drove our way over and were very pleased when they were ready once we got there!  The place was packed at 11PM on a Sunday night with locals which is always a good sign.

To my happy surprise all of the tacos were foil wrapped on plates separately which made sharing them so much easier. I was expecting huge togo boxes filled with tacos. You definitely get more bang for your buck if you order them with flour tortilla but I feel like that is a serious crime. They still do a very good job of giving you a lot of meat on the corn tortillas! I opted to try the a lengua, a carne asada, and adobada taco. 

LENGUA: The lengua came in generous tender chunks! Not too chewy and very succulent I wish I had gotten more. However at $2.25 a pop I thought that was pretty pricey. But I guess that's what you have to pay for a decent taco in Vegas. 

ASADA: The carne asada taco to me was pretty dry and chewy. I have definitely had better and I am glad I did not opt to just order only asada as I usually do.

ADOBADA: ADOWHA?! I was very excited to try the adobada taco as I don't see this type of meat on the menu at many places. They call it ""spicy pork"" there but it is not spicy at all. The pink tint on the skin of the pork reminds you a bit of chinese bbq pork and makes you almost wonder what it's doing in a taco. But boy is it so good! The meat is so delicious and plentiful! Now ever since that fateful day I have been on a search for some well reviewed adobada in Socal with no avail and cannot wait to get back to Vegas to get some more of this rare gem!",JcCNyiiwxprHRsdP4tKijA,4,2,5,_Bd1SekhD-e9m-RRd5gMxg

Probably my favorite thing about this place is not the fact that they have two locations, one in Tijuana and the other in Las Vegas. The best thing about El Gordo is they offer NO el pollo items. I love it, since chicken tacos are pretty stupid. There is not enough fat and tendon juices that can enhance a chicken taco to umami levels. No chicken, I love it.

The Al pastor is Mexico City style and perfect snack between 4-5 hour gambling sessions at the Wynn and Palazzo. The lengue with a little lime and onion is perfectly braised. The tripe tacos are also perfect and feel really healthy when you have them.

I need this spot once a day when I'm in Vegas regardless of what the encore at Wynn/Venetian/Cosmo/mgm are offering in their buffets. I end up winning after eating this Al pastor.",Tqf-UOb80ZW6YyXX0iOQIA,2,5,5,hRucaNNwtyEPGppE0LtuqQ

You haven't had tacos until you've had them at this place. I envy anyone that lives near a Tacos El Gordo. That used to be me until I moved from San Diego to Chicago. People in Chicago rave about tacos and Mexican food but it pales in comparison to this place.

Order the cabeza tacos. Sure, it sounds disgusting. But I love head! *insert dirty joke here* No seriously though. The meat is moist, sweet and delicious. The perfect taco.

Also, be sure to save room for some adobada mulas. I never knew what a mula was until I came here. Basically, it's a quesadilla version of their taco. SO GOOD!

This location is open until 2am on the weekends so do yourself a favor and make a stop here. Leave the club early if you have to. It's worth it.",zolJ74a05lmEAbm9KlY7Gg,3,2,5,lxAeccAM3H-7akGw2pqwdg

We opted to go to the Charleston location with a big group who all had not tried it yet so that was cool. It wasnt too long of a drive from the City Center where were staying for the weekend.

So indeed you wait in line for the meat you want, as other Yelpers have pointed out. We wanted mainly pork adobada tacos so we were posted up in that line. Al pastor was also available there so that was good. It was probably the longest line at that time. So you can order tacos, mulitas, quesadillas, sopes and the loaded fries as long as they're of whichever meat is served in that specific line. 

I really liked the adobada flavor. It's different than what I usually have. It had great stewed-in flavor and I like that. The al pastor was also very good. Great flavor on that meat... I also went in line for the suadero tacos. That's the middle line which was generally empty when we were there. Maybe it's because they also served sesos and cabezas in that line. Haha... I get it. Might be too crazy for some folks. But i'm sure they do those well too... The suadero tacos are very tasty. My understanding is that suadero is rib meat and it was real good. Moist not dry. I liked it a lot. The campechana fries are a monster. And at $13 is a meal in itself.

Plenty of parking in a shared lot. It's a bit down Charleston so keep driving until you see the shopping plaza on your right side if you're coming from the Strip. Bring your patience... Wait in line.

They give you a creamy green sauce (avocado cream?  cilantro cream?)  and a righteous red sauce.  I can't imagine a better taco (til i open mine very own taqueria.  stay tuned for that).

5659191,2013-09-03,2,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"(Unpublished piece I wrote for a magazine.) 

One of Las Vegas' best kept secrets is sitting squarely on the Strip (with another location downtown). Known for the most delicious street tacos this side of Baja California, Tacos El Gordo has an almost cult-like following, and for good reason.

With favorites such as tacos al pastor, to tender lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head), Tacos el Gordo sells not only some of the most flavorful tacos, but the cheapest you can get for the quality. Despite their Strip location, tacos are between $2 - $2.25 each. Piled high with toppings and hand chopped meat, the tacos are finished with a drizzle of homemade salsas and served right off of the grill. 

Although routinely very busy, the lines tend to be deceiving. Each chef on the line cooks up a different type of meat, with patrons lined up in front of whichever station they want their taco from. Somewhere near the middle, green onions and various whole peppers are grilled to buttery perfection. Motion for a plate of these - they come free with your meal. 

If tacos aren't your style, Tacos el Gordo offers lengua and adobada fries, with meat cut straight off of a large spit. Topped with sour cream, cheese and guacamole, these fries can easily sustain a party of four. Although the menu is generally small, quesadillas, nopal (cactus) and tostadas are also available.

Before paying, fill up on fresh limes and radish slices to compliment the tacos, free of charge. Top off the meal with a glass of frothy, cold horchata. It is a life saver if you've consumed one too many grilled peppers halfway through your meal. 

Trying to find a table may prove difficult during the lunch rush or late night. But don't despair, the tacos are well worth it, sitting down or standing up.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,2,4,iHG4HM0wVryURimgFurigw

Sopas (Al Pastor) $4-Slightly above average- The Sopas here is 10x better than anything I've had in So Cal.  It's overflowing up w/ meat, covering the entire corn base.  It's also loaded w/ veggies, sauce, guac, and covered w/ a hard shell on top (I didn't care for the hard shell, I actually removed it when I ate it).  While expensive, I highly recommend it.  My only gripe was the Al Pastor was very sweet.

Sopas (Carne Asada) $4-Exceptional-Same as above, except the carne asada is cooked to perfection.

Tacos (Carne Asada) $2-Slightly above average.  Again, the tacos here are much better than what I've had in Cali.  The sauce on the tacos really give it a great taste.  I'm used to ""Cali"" tacos which only have onions & cilantro.  Carne asada here is pretty good.

Tacos (Al Pastor) $2-Average - Same as above, except the al pastor was way too sweet.

Carne Asada Fries $10 - Slightly above average- I think the fries are pretty good but nothing to write home about.  If you are sharing w/ a group of people I'd go for it, otherwise you are OK passing on it.

first sentence , stopping ,heading there, eating some mulas, tacos and
quesadillas, get so full that when I come back I cant even write my
name. It is that good, or im a fatty mcpherson.I would like to believe
it's the 1st.

Yes it looks sketchy, yes its right next to the wynn in a weird plaza, or on a not that nice of a part on charleston blvd,
yes you will have to walk a little far if you are staying at caesars
or mandalay , but it totally worth it. The adobada meat, the carne
asada, mulas tacos, quesadillas(real ones) are the real deal; Full of
flavor , and  authenticity.

Sometimes there might be a line but goes pretty fast. If you got at
""damn im drunk and need to eat something right now"" time of the day,
which is after midnight, you might encounter  this said line to be a
little bigger. Fear not..95 percent of the time, it goes quick and

Walking in you may ask yourself, what line for what? I admit if I had not learned Spanish through Rosetta Stone I'd be tornadoing in confusion. But take your time to google the meats before you choose your lines and you will be fine!

The taco dilemma was in full effect here. What combination plate should I create?

My Taco Creation

(2) Asada: The asada was nice. It wasn't full of fatty pieces nor was it over salty. You can taste a bite and feel like you're in your mothers vecindario. 4.25/5

(1) Lengua: I always need that tongue action and Tacos El Gordo gave it to me nicely. Soft and chewy and flavorful, no fault here. 4.25/5

(1) Al Pastor: Would of been 2 but someone drunk dropped one. My favorite out of them all. The meat was marinated to perfection. 4.75/5

(1) Asada Sope: This was okay, sope ingredients were eh. 3/5

Tortillas: Not handmade but it's a street taco not a mercado taco. Fits the schema well. 

Customer Service was Mexican fast paced, meaning no smiles, just order and keep it moving, except for the cashier (;

Tacos are made to be eaten here. It's quite that simple.",pU6GoRTcl1rIOi6zMynjog,3,2,4,PXl4MI9uIXSDfTebcTcKCw
5752719,2015-07-26,0,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"Well, it is what it is.  If you want those little tacos with sizzling meat slabbed on as it's grilling, topped with veggies, pico de gallo, and other sauces all in about 10 seconds flat, tasting all delish with proper grilled taste, this is the place to go.  It's a close facsimile of El Taorina, except I think it's better.  

Line doesn't move terribly fast but once you get up to order it goes quickly.  Then you line up at the pay line and that can take a bit also, but all in all not a bad wait overall.  I guess it all depends on when you go, and if there are 15-20 people in line I can see it taking a bit of time before you sit down to eat.  As it was for us, there were only couple of tables open as we were cashing out but we only spent total of less than 10 minutes through the entire process.  That's pretty good for that level of busy-ness, I think.

The Asada and Adobada were both very good, but the the spicy adobada took the cake.  Outstanding stuff.  $2 each, thinking 3 will be enough for most, maybe 4, so not a bad price for lunch and definite bargain for dinner.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Well, it is a fast-food type of place so it's certainly fine, but you'll have a hard time feeling good about taking a whole table all by yourself with all those people waiting...  Take it to go.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,3,2,5,c1VbjC_w2RLk3dysiW459A

""Tres tacos de adobada, por favor."" Thats all you need to know. I love the color, the flavor, and the spicy kick from the pork -- a variation of al pastor, but better. The carne asada is okay, but boring. The lengua is also a standout. Wallet-friendly prices, which is such a welcome relief in Vegas and on the Strip -- especially if you're dirt frickin' poor from losing all your money gambling.

First time stepping in, it can get a bit confusing on where to order. There are supposed to be different stations for each type of taco, but just brush up on your Spanish and go loco.

The downsides to Tacos El Gordo:
It is one of the worst lines systems in the world. As far as efficiency, it's the worst. Combine that with cramming people on every side, and it really begins to get on your nerves when you're hungry.
Also, as far as me, everyone speaking in a language I don't understand makes things difficult.

I've never felt so out of place before, as we were the only non Mexicans there, but everyone was super nice. The adobada guy even offered us a sample slice. It reminded me a little of Korean spicy pork. I went with an adobada taco, carne asada taco and chorizo sope.
There was an assembly line with the first woman making tortillas by hand. The adobada was everything the yelpers said it was! Spicy, a bit of crispy, and not much fat. I definitely want to get adobada fries next time. 
Carne asada was ok, but not my fav. It was thinly sliced vs chopped like most Mexican places. It was nice and tender with good flavor, which was ruined by the awful pasty guacamole it automatically was topped with. The guac was pretty damn bad. 
Chorizo sope was good, the least greasy chorizo I've ever had with  Mexican white cheese melted on top. The texture was almost like a good mozzarella. I've had better sopes, BUT I've also had worse :)
Neighborhood was way sketchy, but Tacos el gordo was very clean, they had 2 ladies there just bussing the tables so there's quick turn over. Parking lot was well lit so I felt pretty safe there. It was great Mexican but I probably would only go back if I was in the general area.

I hear the branch on the Las Vegas strip is better but I was already very impressed by the downtown branch. The tacos here are freshly made, both meat AND tortilla! Average price per taco is about $2.25, which may sound slightly expensive compared to taco trucks in LA, but it's definitely worth it! Each taco contains a LOT of meat. Not only that, but they give a very generous amount of guacamole per taco. All that combined with the rich flavor is reason enough why they're so well known!
Be prepared to wait in line for at least 30-45 minutes though, especially for the Al Pastor. I personally did not try the Al Pastor because the line hadn't moved for a good 15 or so minutes and I was hungry so I will definitely be back to try this in the future! They also have Asada Fries for $13!

Upon walking into the restaurant, the first thing you see is a huge meat pineapple. Seriously! 

The line was pretty long but moved fairly fast. The place was PACKED! Luckily for us, the time we spent in line was spent talking to people around us to find out just what the heck we should order and what the heck the meat pinapple was.

The meat pineapple is pork on a vertical spit with pineapple on top so that the yummy juices drained down onto the meat. Through the other patrons, we found out that if we ordered the Tacos de Adobada we would get to partake of the meat pineapple. We were also advised to order 3, which seemed to be a sufficient amount since they are rather small. I did see several people go back for a second (or third) meal, so if you're hungry you might want to order more. 

I can certainly see going back here as a tradition for our Vegas visits. The food is delicious, and definitely more ""authentic"" than we get in Nashville.",R1xxRcTY3RpfDtGjisYEjg,2,0,4,VaOYMUIma3FFz-8jyXLZng

We go out drinking, you know?  And then it pops up in brain.. ""mmm tacos.""  Normally, my mom is making them and we just go home, but when my mom is too busy to do them, we go for this place.  

They got it all!  Lengua, Buche, Tripas, cachete, Al Pastor, Adobada and of course Carne Asada. Al Pastor fries are the best! I get them with errything!!!  Pineapples too. 

The only bad thing about this place is the bathroom!  Yuck!!!!!! I guess it's supposed to be a single person bathroom because they have a toilet and a stall, but it's all together... no divider, no door that when you peek in the crack, or look at the floor you can see the eyes or the feet of the pooper...  nothing!  And I'm pretty sure it only gets cleaned in the morning cuz by 5pm it looks horrible and unwelcoming.  Long story short: I was afraid to wash my hands.  

Highly recommend taking whippes or moist towelettes or sanitizer. Maybe even a table cloth...

Another bad thing is the tables in between the long ass lines.  It's so uncomfortable having people just stare at you eating and hovering over your food. 

Unless you're like me and I stare right back and chew with my mouth open on purpose till they stop looking at me!

The other bad thing about this place is the ""chusma"" who comes to eat here.  I don't mind people, I really don't, it's just the ones that go to short line (normally the Tripa) and then go ahead and order: Al Pastor, Carne Asada Fries, pineapples, cebollas, mulas, huaraches, tortas, aztecas, HBO Go, Netflix, horchata, tostadas for their entire family...  everything that line is not for!!! the business of course being nice, they go ahead and do it for them, but that's why people keep doing that shit.  If your signs says Tripas, only take trips orders!!!!! Not the entire menu!!!  

Other than that I'd give this place 5 stars. The bathroom drops it to 4. 

Anglos:  this place is safe!  They even have an armed security guard on patrol...  wait... now that I think about...  maybe that means it's not so safe....

The adobada ones are closest to the door so we decided to get some because there was no wait period & thats what we did wrong!

5880008,2013-04-04,2,CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q,"The tacos here are magnificent. But before we get started with the big review, some quick tips.

1. The meats are divided into sections with INDIVIDUAL lines!

2. There are two locations for Tacos El Gordo, the second one being near the Encore.

3. This locations prices are a little bit better, but if you're driving from the strip, it's probably more worth it to go to the first location.

4. Try the Adobada tacos, their carne asada tacos are equally good too!

5. For the Adobada tacos, everything means all the fixings EXCEPT for the pineapple! Ask the guy making them for a tiny slice of tacos.

6. The fries come in three flavors: campenchana, adobada, or ANY meat. Don't be fooled that the sign says adobada or campenchana only.

7. The fries come in half/full size, a half size is more than enough for two people to share and just right for three to sample!

8. Plenty of parking! Two entrances!

After discovering Tacos El Gordo on our second trip to Vegas, we have gone back every single time to eat at their fine establishment. There are MANY meats to choose from, but by far our favorite is the adobada. My personal one that I really like is the carne asada.

What truly sets apart Tacos El Gordo is that they grill up/fry up their meat right in front of you. You can watch them cooking up your stuff and making the tacos. Another thing that I really enjoy is the great service. Every single time we've been there, they've always been really nice to me and my girlfriend. I think it might because they see us as Asians in a Mexican joint who have no idea what's going on. But beyond that, the place is really clean. They wipe down tables after people are done and the cleaning ladies usually offer to take our trays for us when we're still sitting down and finished.

The last thing is the price. For Vegas, this place is a steal. We usually get somewhere from 6 tacos, a drink, and a half order of adobada fries for $20.

It's cheap, it's very filling and delicious. A small order of asada fries are only 5 bucks and we were unable to finish ( we did have two tacos before).

The adobada stands out... Have it with fries ( LOADED with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, PINEAPPLE) or in tacos, quesadillas, or mulas. Either way you can't go wrong with adobada.

Asada was the second best although I didn't enjoy the pico de gallo, it was weird on a taco, I usual have that with chips.....  I was not too fond of the greenish running guac salsa? Although everyone seemed to love it.  The chorizo was too dry and over cooked, although I might not be used to type ( seasoning) of chorizo.

They have a soda fountain so you can get as many refills they also have Mexican drinks such as horchata, jamaica and pineapple juices also unlimited fills and self serve. They have a lime and radishes bar but no salsas .. Which I thought was different. This place is more like caferia style dinning which was a hassle, being there for the first time and not knowing how to order sucked but I totally got over that since we were there the very next day.

As far as the location, it's not a really nice area nor is it fancy, It's open late but it's always full of people. If after 1am ur going to run into a lot of clubbers.. Most not sober. During the day this place if full of families.

After discovering that the location on the Strip had closed down, we ventured to this branch on Charleston Boulevard, only to be met with the long lines nearly coming out the door. A couple of us scoped out a table, while the others waited in line. We decided to go for broke and order a little bit of everything, which meant waiting in each of the different lines, since each line served a different type of meat. The wait took about 20 minutes, but we were rewarded for our patience.

My favorite were the al pastor, cabeza, and carne asada tacos. The asada tacos had that delicious char that you get with grilling over the fire, which was awesome. The cabeza tacos were great too, albeit a bit on the fattier side. We got a few of the vampiros which were bomb as well. The horchata tasted freshly made and not too sweet. The crown jewel, though, was easily the carne asada fries. A bunch of shoestring fries, topped with cheese, carne asada, guac, and a variety of sauces. A huge portion for $10, and they don't skimp on the meat. So bomb. Comes with some grilled vegetables and different fixings, which are pretty tasty.

The service is relatively quick, the prices are cheap, and the food is very satisfying. Definitely will be back when I'm back in Vegas and hopefully not dead from being chased by loan sharks. Ha.",eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw,5,3,4,l0wcS42IvMd09pX9HkQdLw

OperatingHours:
M-Th 9am-2am
F-Sat 9am-4am

I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and will try most things at least once plus willing to make the trip to get it.  So after spending too much time in the school library and still needing to find a good late night spot to eat, I somehow found the Yelp reviews for Tacos  El Gordon on the East side of Las Vegas.  The reviews were all positive, and the pictures posted helped cement my decision to drive 40+ blocks down Charleston to find this tacos heaven.

The place was not difficult to locate, as it was a corner unit facing the E. Charleston Blvd.  The restaurant is well-lit inside, with modest décor but the tables, side garnish and drinking fountain stations are spotlessly clean. Even at 10:45pm on a quiet Wednesday night, the lines in front of the ordering counters seem to swell and ebb like the motion of the distant oceans.  Luckily most here are old pros at ordering the tacos and the lines moved quickly.  Even though I felt like a tourist visiting Mexico here, the friendly gentleman at the Adoboda station greeted me warmly with ""what can I get you my friend?"" and helped me translate their fairly straightforward and simple menu, he even helped my placed the rest of my orders at the other station when he was done fixing up my two Taco de Adobodas.

By the time I was at the cash register, my red plastic tray is brimming with 6 tacos (2 Adobodas, 2 Asadas, 1 Chorizo and 1 Lengua), a plate of the grilled scallions and roasted pepper and a cup for their bottomless Horchta ($1.40) all for just under $15.  Pretty sweet deal for what many reviewers are saying as very authentic Mexican street tacos.  I am no taco expert, but a restaurant filled with paying Mexican and Hispanic patrons is a great endorsement and what I look for when seeking a taco shop like this.

Tace de Adoboda - (""Shepherd's Style"") Spicy pork with adobo seasoning slowly roasted like, and shaved off the rotating skewer into the freshly prepared homemade hot corn tortilla and topped off with the sauces, onions, cilantros.  I enjoyed this the most.  5 stars!

Taco de Asada - Basically a carne asada taco with the regular fixings.  Taste was just okay for me, the portion of beef was generous but I felt it was a tad dry.  3 stars.

Taco de Chorizo - Made with the firmer chorizo and not the kind that melts into a poodle of grease and spices.  Others don't seem to care much for this taco, but I thought it was good.  4 stars!

Taco de Lingua - The ""tongue"" taco.  I really want to like this more, but it was just a little salty for my taste.  Otherwise the portion of the beef tongue was also generous.  I will still give it another try.  2.5 stars.
The grilled scallions and roasted pepper was good and the lady behind the counter really filled the plate for me, even though I only needed like  of the scallions.  I might have used more if the scallions were chopped up, but I will chalk that up as being the traditional and authentic way it is served up at the street taco carts.

Oh yea, the tacos here are not big and can be disposed off easily in 3-4 normal bites, but at $2 each (plus tax) and with the generous meat toppings, it is a still good yummy deal.

Décor:  2/5  Very modest, but you are here first and foremost for the food, right?
Food:  4/5  Overall, very pleased with the tacos here.  If it is closer to me, I will likely be here at least 1-2/week, alas that is a lot of traffic lights to drive through at 35mph.
Service:  5/5  For a low cost and unpretentious restaurant, the service was friendly and fast.
Cleanliness:  5/5  There is something to be said about how the staff here keeps the busy front of the restaurant area spotlessly clean.  Very nice!
Parking:  3/5  May not find the closest parking spaces but there are many in this strip mall.
Location:  3/5  Located in probably not the best part of town, but it is in a location that is surrounded by the bulk of their targeted demographic and on a heavily traversed street no less.  Perhaps a bit out of the way for those living on the West side of the 15, but the drive wasn't too bad later in the evening once the traffic dies down.

The line system is kind of inconvenient. If you want Adobada/Al Pastor and Asada you have to wait in 2 different lines. If you want buche/lengua/tripa it's another line.

Just wish it wasn't so aggravating standing in line forever and trying to get a table.",VDd76GM11DVvK7gKxFtD0g,0,0,5,oVOKtREzisqHJoFa11GBrQ

They also give you a side of grilled pineapple, onions & jalapeños. Pure perfection #TeamAdobada  had more flavor than the asada. Lol",jqa-eb5vLKVZV45Q1GzTbw,1,0,5,lg6rGGU9iKvzhL1fGmtIYg
