I had to repeat myself at least 5 times order two of the 9 pc's. The girl was not listening or an able to hear I'm not sure. 

I got to the window and it was $9 and I told her I wanted 2 sauces for each and that we had never been there before and we're excited to try it. She said she could give me one of each and charge me 25 cent for additional sauce. I told her we wanted one barbecue and one ranch and I'll pay for a mustard so I can see what it was like. 

She gave us two ranch, I went back (literally backed up) for a BBQ and a mustard!  Crunchy dry garbage or greasy pieces, and all were lacking flavor. $9.00 is not worth it. I am upset that they are in business! She was put out that I asked for the correct sauces. And absolutely nobody was smiling inside the establishment. My 9 year old asked ""why does everybody looks so gloomy in that store?"" Avoid like the plague. Really disappointing after coming back from the south where they have GOOD chicken. 

The sign said ""Chicken and biscuit"" and there were no BISCUITS even available!",DK01jsn-JcbiBamE1pB1mQ,4,0,1,IeDYXvfST7iuD3Hlla7NkA

We waited about 10-15 mins and then the manager comes out and says the cook gave our food to someone else. He says that he will give us something extra for our wait, so we thought that was fair. So 15 mins more pass and he finally gives us our food. It was late and we were exausted so as soon as we got the bag we left and went home. We get home and we are missing our 2 Large sides and biscuits. The 12 piece was cold and wasnt all spicy. Not to mention, the two chicken tender meals had freezing cold fries and luke warm chicken that wasnt even spicy like requested. Eventually we went back. It was 30 mins before closing time and they were closed up, locked doors and everything, eventually they remade fries and gave us our sides. I LOVE Popeyes!

We both like chicken and hadn't tried Popeyes yet so we stopped in to try it. It was about 11 pm there was only one customer in they're besides us and after waiting for ten minutes they never got to us and got down our order. They were just kinda slothing around in the kitchen area making the other persons order and never took the time to get to us so we ended up just leaving not even having a chance to try the food.,a5o-Occwj7-24ia5vd9hDw,0,0,1,nHMHbYEKA-TZ5QNtlMg7ig

It's a running joke in my family as to what items they will either be out of or flat out tell you they refuse to make it unless you would like to wait 20 min. It's always a complete surprise what kind of chicken you will end up with no matter what kind you actually ordered. Today on a Sunday afternoon they were out of sweet tea. The girl at the register said we didn't bother with it today.  actually made me laugh. Oh and also. No biscuits. But  I did get some chicken.

1339870,2016-10-09,3,rIDzNikbeBSR1jbwN-7ydQ,"I'm surprised that this place you call a business is rated at 2 stars...

It was this last Monday night 10.3.16 at 7:30pm. I ordered through the drive through service. I ordered a meal which included the standard chicken-fries-biscuit. A normal order, so you would think. I pull up, I give payment, and I receive my order. I drive off, and 10 mins later I ask my wife for some fries, and fries are not in the bag... I head back to the restaurant. This is when everything goes to shit. I should have known this was bound to happen when you see another customer storming off the property kicking the door open. 

So I head into the restaurant and I tell the so called manager on duty that the fries were not in the bag that she handed me at the drive thru. She then replies with, it should be there, I HAD A CHECKLIST...  I replied with, are you serious? She replied with never mind... with attitude. I then go to my car, and get the bag that she handed me and she proceeds to look like in the bag... I then told her, do you think I would really drive 10 mins back to this place just so I can get an extra side of fries? This manager insists that she had a checklist... she keeps an annoyed and bothered look in her face and body language. Meanwhile there were two other associates with her working the register and the fryer... saying, this is bullshit, fuck this, fuck that... apparently this type of service has been happening all night. It seemed like they were tired of her mistakes from the night. 

At this point, I was pretty heated and I just wanted to get out of this place. What a disappointment. I've loved this brand for a while now. This one incident really put a bad impression and taste in my mouth. I'll make sure I go out of my way and go to another establishment going forward.

We have been to three locations so far and each time we've tried to order an 8 piece meal and EACH TIME your stores have told us they don't have enough mild chicken and that I would need to wait 12-15 mins. It doesn't matter what time of the day I go, your stores always tell me they don't have enough chicken! 

My most recent visit was to your S. Rainbow location (store# 10732), we placed our order via drive thru with a female team member. We told her we wanted the 8 pc family meal and she gave us our total and told us to drive up. I was so relieved when she didn't say they ran out of chicken. So, we drive up and wait about 2-3 mins when a male employee came to the window to deliver the news, ""we don't have enough mild chicken to complete the 8pc but I can throw in some spicy chicken. If I wanted spicy I would have ordered spicy! I wish I had the male employee's name, but the 'Employee Name' noted on my receipt states ""Order Taker"". At this point, I'm extremely annoyed that we were not advised of this BEFORE we placed our order. We were going to cancel it, then your male employee told us he would throw in some pies and a drink while we wait. I was still hesitant because PIES doesnt change the fact you had us waiting in the drive thru just to tell us the SAME THING EVERY SINGLE TIME WE TRY TO ORDER FROM YOUR STORE.... ""WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH MILD CHICKEN!"" Why offer a drive thru when you have to park and wait for your food every time? Is this your definition of fast food? 

We agree to wait because your male employee also stated it wouldn't take the whole 15 mins. So, we wait and then he finally walks out with our order. As we're driving away... I check the bag and  Surprise, Surprise... NO PIES were found! So, now your employees are resorting to LYING in order for your customers to agree to wait? Is this the type of customer service your company allows your employees to provide....Lying? Why don't you teach your employees to provide the TRUTH? Don't offer something that you're actually not going to give. Instead of diffusing the situation, all your employee did was fuel my anger and resentment towards my overall experience with Popeyes. I definitely won't be visiting another Popeyes location any time soon and I will ensure that my family and friends do the same thing! This is the worst customer service you can provide to ANYONE.

I guess you need to go to Texas or Louisiana because they Still have it for .99 on Tuesday's every Tuesday still I wonder why there and not here",cE5HW29H8VyB8I_yLsvEyw,0,0,1,glqrNiN3ZgDlauMyxxDD4g

I said the wait time was unacceptable. Drove home and within minutes called to complain. Lady that answered the phone said she was the manager, I said no - the guy in blue is - and she backtracked and said she was one of them. When Robert got on the phone he put me on speaker. Called him out on his unprofessionalism and he didn't even try to pacify my concern when in the first place he said he had to deal with the customer in line because she was upset. No Robert, she wasn't upset. You guys were flirting - on my time.

I pull up to drive through and order an 8 piece all dark spicy dinner with a large red beans and rice.

So now for the 3rd time I am told that they don't have enough dark meat and can only give me 5 dark and two white. Constantly!! This time I want what I ordered 20 minutes ago. Sabrina the manager comes to the window to tell me that they don't have enough dark and that  Ill have to wait for another 9 minutes. I ask why this happens to me all the time and she said special orders always take longer. She then thought that I had ordered all white, saying it would take longer and if I wanted to wait. I said yes, and she asked me to pull away from the takeout window to which I said no. If it costs them business because they cant ever get an order right then I am staying put until they get me my correct order. How hard can that be? While I am waiting I see the manager on her phone and all the employees looking at me as if I'm the one that caused the problem. Two other employees came to the window asking me to pay or move my car to wait. I stay put. The third time I asked for the managers name and they said they didn't know. And that I was being rude. I just smiled and said I'm here until you get me my correct order. 10 more minutes go by and the cars behind me have left and all cars now coming up to the drive through are being told it is closed as I watch 3 other cars pull up to order and then back up to come inside.

This rating is not to compare this fast food to gourmet chicken, but to other fast food chicken restaurants 

The chicken is always juicy, hot, and delicious. I usually go there on Tuesdays for the great deals.

The only reason I wouldn't leave a perfect score is the fact that something is always missing. One time I went they didn't have honey for my biscuits, very disappointing. Next time, there was no spicy. 

Apart from that the chicken was very good so they deserve the stars for the taste. I can't demerit them too much for running out so close to closing.",Ks36f9ptWGPExZH2aJQiAQ,3,2,4,AqvKhAw-vaDs8srDDhvXXA

I went for a lunch break one day in particular and it took over 45 mins for 2 basic chicken combo orders to be given because no chicken was readily available in their warmer or no beans ready! I was the only person in line and it took them 15mins to acknowledge me and another 5 to even take my order with a employee thinking the operations herself was in disbelief but thought it was funny to laugh about. Unprofessional and bad representation to even feel sanitary to eat there with their bad inefficient work ethics. A manger was on site as well who came onto the floor and couldn't care to assist in proper work flow!!! Horrible service and inadequate service for a ""fast food chain""! And forget about drive thru because for basic mild leg and thigh value packs almost always have a wait!!! Eliminates those employees with an attitude that is a disservice to the company and assign them somewhere they don't need to deal with customer service or get better management!!!

2911668,2015-01-21,8,rIDzNikbeBSR1jbwN-7ydQ,"This is the Popeye's location that is just off the west side of Rainbow and Badura. It is actually attached to a gas station. It is a fairly small location, with not much in the way of in room seating. This was definitely built as a grab-and-go in mind.

I am not a huge fried chicken guy, but I did enjoy grabbing some Popeye's on occasion when I lived over by their Windmill and LV Blvd location. Unfortunately, this location is not nearly as good as that one.

For one, the service is painfully slow. I mean like molasses rolling uphill in the winter time slow. They have a pretty good special on Tuesdays where you can get a two piece combo of chicken(1 leg, 1 thigh) for $1.29! This only seems to make wait times worse. Tonight I only had 2 cars in front of me and it took almost 15 minutes to get to the window! Damn!

When we finally got to the window, the young man was nice and confirmed our order. Only thing that bugged me was I got ""dude-man-bro'ed"". I don't expect 5 star, 5 diamond service at Popeye's, but it does come across as a bit too casual. He meant well, though.

The chicken was a bit greasier than I remembered, even by fast food fried chicken standards.

Even though this was a bit of a disappointing experience, I will give Popeye's another shot again in the future. When they have their stuff together it can be a tasty product at a good price.

Just not tonight.

They thanked us for our patience and kept the train moving along! I can definitely appreciate that. The chicken was as fresh as it could possibly get on this order!

I usually go through the drive through here, but I won't ever again, nor will I visit ever again. When we got home after ordering an eight piece meal and only seven were included and they weren't even right as there was 1 spicy and the rest mild rather than 1 mild and the rest spicy. The fries and jambalaya were cold as well. 

When we called them, and asked for the Manager we got David. He was like so what mistakes happen, drive the twenty minutes back to get your one piece. It was explained to him that we were in for the night because I had taken my pain meds(just blew my ankle apart and having surgery the next morning) and could drive. Why don't they have a delivery service send it over and apologize, or pay for us an Uber he refused and only said if I am on duty next time I will give you your chicken and that was all he would do. I wanted to return all the food but couldn't because after the pain meds I can't drive.

My husband went to Popeyes to get dinner for the family, and $45 later (yes $45 for crap fast food) he gets home and there were no biscuits. The female employee who was taking his order argued with my husband on the order. Hubby asked for 6 tenders spicy and 10 regular. She kept saying that Half and Half. Um no. It's not. Finally my husband was like ""whatever, just get my food"". 

So back to no biscuits....  I decided to drive the 10min back to the store, on Rainbow in evening traffic to get some damn biscuits. I was greeted by a young man. Seemed pleasant and friendly. I told him my husband got home with no biscuits and my family is currently eating without me. He walked away. Another young man gets my biscuits and then asks ""is there anything else?""  How about an apology? How about a credit or perhaps some extra chicken? Geez. Just get me home already. So 30min for everything I get home and the family is done eating and the food is cold. 

I immediately wrote a complaint on Popeyes website, and received a call about 20min later. I was on another call dealing with a family emergency so I ignored it. No voicemail. No attempt to call me again. Nothing. I googled the number to see that it came from Popeyes. So I called it back. I was handed off to the ""general manager"". She was very nice. She apologized profusely. Which I appreciated. She then said she would give me 2 two piece meals free. Just mention her name to whatever manager is working. Um...why not just mail me some coupons? So I would have to go speak to a manager again just to get two little meals? I could've taken my kids to Cicis for half the price or Sweet Tomatoes for $15 less than I was charged at Popeyes and they would've like the food better.
