142892,2015-11-17,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,This restaurant I came across after trying to get into another. It has a nice bar in the middle so sat there to dine. Bar tender was nice but talked to much so service was slow for all of us. I ordered the Cesar salad which was good. Then the veal Piccata which the Veal was good but the sauce was a little thick and sweat. They suggested the fried peppers as a side dish which was really bad and as a presentation looked the part. Also they were playing a monster movie on all the tv's that line the walls and it was a scene of a guy getting his face shot up which made eating pasta interesting. I would pass on this pace.,DbrtMSd9jg4CIFpnpK6Rkw,1,0,3,SSO0bkr2w4HQZMc3P2XDfw
153561,2014-11-12,3,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,Bottom line don't go !!!  They push the over priced specials.  Will not serve plain old tap water then charge you big time for bottled water.  And the owner says don't break my balls this is the way I cook.  Well first of all your not there cooking.  I'm Italian the food has to much Garlic and to much salt. OVER PRICED OVER PRICED OVER PRICED .  My recommendation go some where else.,UfcHtNAc6jhRltCjbYmpsw,1,0,1,1qKCF039BmXw65xGL6R4vg

We had the shrimp bibsy special (shrimp with a sweet and slightly spicy caramelized coating), the chicken parmesan,  the gnocci, and dessert.  My favorite was easily the shrimp and I am definitely coming back at some point for more. 

The service was top notch from start to finish.  I was surprised every time i needed something it was already there before i could even think to ask.  It was truly amazing.",UGlYnILOIPuj9g-we5uTtw,1,0,5,kGlN7yxyKYBSoCwiZ7ny8w
243310,2017-03-15,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"What started out as a sub-par experience turned into a fun night.  We had reservations for 7:15, and the restaurant was absolutely packed when we arrived.  We waited about 45 minutes to an hour after our reservation time before being seated.  We actually had decided to leave because we had tickets to a show and were afraid we'd miss it.  Upon discussing the situation with the manager (or perhaps owner?), he promised to make it work.  We were assigned a manager or some type of higher-up as our waiter, and he was wonderful.  Bread with oil and vinegar was served (one of the things I miss most about Italy!) as an appetizer.  I ordered the tagliatelle alla bolognese and a red wine that the waiter suggested (which paired nicely).  Our food arrived promptly, and was flavorful and authentic.  The other two people in my party enjoyed the meal as well.  We had a great time and made it to the show.  They even gave us our meals on the house!  
I deducted one star mostly because of the hostess.  She kept quoting huge parties a 20 minute wait time when it was clearly going to be over an hour.  She seemed quite inexperienced.  That aside, I would definitely go back next time I'm in town, but maybe on a night I don't have other plans.",ti44cCxHdKrLulbpMMx-EQ,0,0,4,MnuAXY88HcV85xer6gaE_g

They have a great Vegas atmosphere- very fun and vibrant! In the middle of my dinner, a screen dropped down and played a movie scene from Austin Powers. Then a while later, there was dance music and a disco ball! 

Food was AMAZING!!! I had the Veal Cutlet Martorano- I mean the guy's name is on it- of course it was freaking delicious!!! I also had the meatball which did not disappoint, but I'm telling you- the Veal Cutlet Martorano is one of the best Italian dishes I have EVER had!",NpxhuEGZrxrYd1aelshpXQ,3,1,5,W96dsSWAMKpVs0Lbmndr0g

315731,2016-09-26,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"This restaurant was a complete disappointment. Disappointed because it wasn't very good. Disappointed because so many people told me that they HEARD it was good. AND most of all. Disappointed because we did not go to Carmines in Caesars Palace.  

This is Vegas. This restaurant should be good for a few basic reasons. 

1. It's Vegas and it's a restaurant in a hotel on the strip.

2. It's in the Paris hotel. This is a nice hotel (for the most part) and to have an Italian restaurant of this nature in this hotel is a shame. 

3.  This restaurant is not to far from Gordon Ramsey's steak house. Have you been there?  It's amazing. If I were Gordon Ramsey I would not want to be in the same building as this so called Italian restaurant.   

OK. Enough rant. Now the facts. Here's my review. 

This restaurant su*ked!!  Plain and simple. I ordered a Cesar salad. If I order a Cesar salad at the Olive Garden I know what I am going to get. I am going to get a mediocre salad with bottled Cesar dressing. Oh.......and not only will I not get anchovies in my Cesar salad, I think most olive gardens do not have anchovies anywhere in the restaurant. But this is not the Olive Garden. This is a fancy Italian restaurant in Vegas on the Strip in the Paris hotel surly they will do a Cesar salad right?  Won't they? .............well......the answer is no. And not only do they do it wrong. They do not even realize it. The Cesar salad at this Italian restaurant doesn't come with anchovies. That is the standard Cesar salad. (I should have left at that point). But.....unlike the Olive Garden you can request them. ....  yea........When my Cesar salad came out, it came with a side of anchovies. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME. That is not how you do it. You do not add the anchovies that way. Even I know that. What a joke. 

OK. One more food item. I know I have rambled on. 

I love nochie. It is my very favorite Italian food. Being Italian my self....(well, mostly anyway) I fell in love with this dish when I was a kid and my friends mom in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania would make it from scratch when I would go to his house on the weekends. WOW!!! It was amazing. This was not the same experience. This nochie tasted like chef Boy-Ar-De  make it last March and was kind enough to put it in a can for the Cuz that runs this restaurant. It was hard. It wasn't dumpling like and tasted blan. Yuk!! 

A lot of words in this review I know. But in Vegas at a hotel like the Paris the food should be better. I have had a better Italian meal at the Olive Garden. 

Stay  away!!!!",u6VR8z6U4-KWV21u5ewz8Q,0,0,1,1s-chz7Ac7ABBgN2MyH0QA

356052,2014-12-08,2,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"I am in the Paris Hotel every weekend, so I thought I would take family there to try it. 

Very underwhelmed and can't really see what the hype is all about. 

Service slow (Sunday night in December) we ordered the Calamari as an appetizer (which was OK) and literally a minute after another waiter showed up with our Entrees! The look on his face when I asked him to come back later was priceless! 

We both had the Veal as Entrees, when It came back the second time, I was very unimpressed. It was just a piece of Breaded Veal with a thick sauce and sliced Parmesan cheese.  No Veg, no sides, nothing. 

The sauce had huge pieces of a very spicy pepper, I love hot and spicy food, but this didn't go with the dish at all. 

It's an expensive place, my wife works for Caesars ent, so we got a discount. To be honest.... There's far better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas for the same prices.",vmEG1qNmRJuF-kSThEQW-A,6,0,1,msXlkmjs_w7dGQFmFZveVA

Sunday gravy, best chicken parmigiana ever, and carbonara served with fresh egg yolk cooked into the warm pasta at the table.  One word of advice: as good as the bread and two types of olive oil (plus pecorino Romano) are, skip them.  You will want every bit of your appetite reserved for the main courses.  Definitely a new favorite in Vegas (and we live here).",35Gzb4Sfylj1OM2SBrGgYw,1,0,5,5djzlj85CZXpn77It-nP9A

It was 9:30 pm, restaurant doesn't close till 11:00 pm. They wanted to put us at the bar with music blasting behind us. Are you kidding me? We just spent $500 there 2 hours before. 

We travel often and know tons of people that travel also.  We will NOT be recommending this place because of this treatment.

We ordered the salad and meatball as the appetizer.  It was excellent.  For the main course I ordered the Spaghetti di avolo and my finace ordered the lamb Bolognese.  Both dishes were extremely salted.  It pretty much ruined any flavor of the herbs and spices that the sauce had.  I couldn't even finish half of my plate.

The drinks were good.  Overall, the service is top notch but the food was borderline inedible.  Just like anything in Vegas, this was expensive, but I think I would have gotten something better tasting for the money we spent there.",7vqv_n0FLW3W6pHiPZVT0w,1,0,3,rLnmC1B3Ck9WxDhatDZkIQ

Thought I would give it another try this week when I was back for another restaurant related convention. this time, the meal was terrible and the service was indifferent. 

The bartender raved about how great the Philly Cheese Steak was and basically told me to order it. when it arrived it was so salty it was not edible. don't misunderstand, I love Philly Steaks and I like salty food as well, but this was disgusting. After he saw I couldn't eat it, he asked if I wanted something else. I ordered a salad and decided to call it a day and chalk it up to a bad meal. However when I received the check, I was amazed to find that the overpriced $18 sandwich  (of which I ate less than half) was on the bill along with the salad.

Tile on the floor is the exact same as the bathroom in my house that was built in 1905. True story,  exact same. This part is not a knock, just truth.

Pasta subsitution is apparently a chore, and was looked down upon. 

Angelhair pasta not offered here.

Al dente only, dont ask for anything else.

No parmesan offered with pasta

Beer selection limited, bummer.

The waiter then gives us a spiel about the owner, food served family style, so if one dish is ready and the others are not, you must serve that dish and wait for the other dish to come out. If your other party doesn't want the dish you ordered, they sit and wait...and wait. They brought the appetizer, after yet another bus boy had brought the wrong dish, and we said we were splitting it. The assistant said he would be back to serve it to us. We waited   and waited while he went to get plates. Then waited some more. Finally he came with some plates.  THREE times the ""assistants/bus boys"" brought us the wrong meal to the table. They gave our food to the table next to us. They did let us keep one misplaced dish, but only after our waiter finally showed up and I told him we didn't order this. He said ""yeah, the other table got your food"" so we had to wait again for the food that we ordered. Since there was only two of us, the waiter was doting on the other table with four people. Bigger tip, I assumed. I ordered ice tea, and got a bottle of Chinese tea and a glass of ice. I guess they have various favors of bottled Chinese tea. Once the correct food finally arrived, it was ok. I've had better, but it was adequate. Will I go back? NO. No excuse for a restaurant that has been open for 6 months for the service. If this chef is so great, I suggest he hire a manager who knows how to staff a restaurant. The service was absolutely terrible and totally disorganized, and we were there on a night that it wasn't busy at all. I shudder to think what happens when that restaurant gets busy.

It was supposed to have fresh veggies and cheese but veggies looked and tasted canned and it was just blah. 
I did have chocolate cake for dessert and it was very moist and good. I saved more than half for next day but unfortunately got very sick to my stomach about 30 minutes after this meal so I ended up throwing it away because I don't know what I ate here that did not agree with me.

Your soda comes in a plastic bottle.  The music is so loud it could make a Slipknot fan complain about auditory pain after dining there.  The server tries to force you to order your entree at the same time as your appetizers and when confronted as to why you need to order our entree right away they smugly answer like mindless buffoons ""Cuz that's the way we do it here"".  By far the worse dining experience we have ever had in Vegas.  We didn't even get past the drinks before leaving that abortion of a restaurant. If you want a comparable dining experience for a lot less money, then do yourself a favor and go to the Double Down on Paradise and scrape the dried sputum off the floor and put it on a plate.

1019800,2015-01-28,9,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"Holyyyyyy Shitballs. This place sucks. (Note: I start every review at 3 stars. You get three stars for existing. Good service? +1 star. Bad food? -1 star. Etc.)

Alright so: The food? Actually not that bad. Pretty decent meatballs, sauce that apparently is called ""gravy."" (Dear Steve Martorano: it's called sauce. Gravy is what you put on turkey on Thanksgiving. It's made from the juices and drippings of the bird. Look it up, cuz.)

So yeah, food was alright. That's as far as this review goes for positive feedback. Go to Martorano's if you enjoy the following:

- LED backlit menus
- an iPad drink menu that gets taken away as soon as you order your first drink (want to peruse the drink menu? Good luck tracking down your waiter to get it.)

- Disco lights that rotate over your table constantly, changing the color of your food from pink to yellow to green to bright white.

- the same 10 loud songs that totally don't fit the meal playing over and over again because apparently whoever is in charge of the music found a mix CD from 1997 in the trash outside of Bally's (Hope you like Doo Doo Brown and Jock Jams vol. 3 while you eat!).

- American Hustle playing on the TV's all around the place. Now listen, I'm into film, I'm a grown ass man, but I don't really appreciate watching permed-up Bradley Cooper mount Amy Adams while I dip my bread in olive oil, ya dig? But apparently they have also been known to play The Godfather pt. 2, which totally fits in with the music. NOT.

This place is what I'd expect from a guy with ""Yo Cuz"" tattooed on his arm. It's like a 14 year old kid tried DJing for 3 years, had no talent, stole his grandmother's sauce recipe (not gravy. SAUCE.), and opened a bunch of restaurants with shallow decor, a limited menu, and ZERO imagination. This is a perfect example of good food with piss poor execution. Slow it down, Steve, ditch all of the flashy crap, and dedicate the place to serving good food. Because the food isn't worth shit when the dining experience is akin to root canal. 

I'm looking forward to heading back next year, when this place is out of business and is replaced by a decent Italian restaurant, just like the one it replaced.

Final Verdict:
+1 Decent Food
-1 Music
-1 Lights, TV's, General Atmosphere
-1 Service (Wait staff is alright. But ordering from an ipad that you share with other tables? Not so much. Oh and be sure to fill out the survey on the ipod touch when you get the bill! It's SO hip!)

I won't say avoid at all costs - but get the food to go. Do not eat in the dining room.",-e14okf6Hwgdl8pRF1gXsQ,7,0,1,2HEZTmlta14oj-0KneCECw
1065560,2014-11-02,2,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"Simply stated, everyone should be aware that this establishment refuses to accommodate any food allergies or food related diseases. 

While I have a number of food allergies, I am definitely not one of those individuals who asks for outrageous customizations to the menu in order to be accommodated and I have never had to walk out of a restaurant due to a refusal to be served - not even in France, where I had to ask (in English!) to have my meal prepared without butter. So, imagine my surprise when I sat down with my extended family, for a birthday dinner for my aunt, and the waiter flat out refused to serve me one of the salads on the menu without dressing and a side of olive oil and vinegar. I did not ask for a dish to be prepared differently, only to not have salad dressing. I explained to the waiter it was a severe allergy and that I would only be ordering wine and the salad and he was so rude and obnoxious in his refusal that he reduced me to tears in front of 8 family members. 

Needless to say, my fiancé and I left the restaurant and my aunt's celebration and will never return to this establishment. From what I understand from those that stayed, the salads were all prepared with far too much dressing, their version of ""al dente"" pasta is literally a workout to chew and is really nothing more than under-cooked and the service and attitude of the staff never improved.

As soon as I gave our name we were seated immediately. The ambiance of this restaurant is FIRST CLASS! The decor, the service, the music, the menus that light up, everything is NEXT LEVEL. We had a wonderful server who came over and seated us immediately. We started off with the Famous Meatball & Salad and Fried Calamari Martorano. One word: AMAZING!!!! The meat ball had SO MUCH flavor. It was very tender and rich but not overcooked at all. It spread apart with a slight push of the fork. The gravy, very flavorful and rich. The salad was fresh and very flavorful as well. The Calamari....seasoned and cooked to PERFECTION along with the sauce and green peppers, hands down the best calamari I've ever eaten, PERIOD! I had actually stopped eating calamari the past 8-10 years because it simply wasn't prepared right the past few times I had eaten it(restaurants should take notes from Steve). These were our appetizers. 
Next up, entrees! The kids kept it very basic, spaghetti with sauce(no gravy, sauce) and salad. My wife ordered Linguine in White Clam Sauce and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. I didn't try any of my wife's but she said it was fabulous. I was nervous about the cheesesteak because I don't like a lot of bread, especially if it's hard and firm. My plate came out and the sandwich was PIPING hot. So hot I had to allow it to cool down. I finally took my first bite and the flavors oozed inside of my mouth. The cheese, the steak(SO tender and juicy) and the bread roll was not too big and it was beyond soft. The meat and cheese seemed like it sank into the inside of the bread and it made a perfect fit! The peppers on the side were spicy(exactly like I like them), juicy and fresh! I only ate half of the sandwich and I was stuffed! The kids finished their meal off with cake that I didn't try ONLY because I was too full. Steve and Marsha treated us like family! Steve is one of the most humble, authentic people I have ever met in my life. What you pay for when dining at Cafe Martorano is a EXPERIENCE, period! Its truly entertainment: the music, the movies on the big screens, the decor, the service, the food; it's simply on another level. When we visit Vegas again in a couple of months I know exactly what I'm ordering and I can't wait! Hands down the best Italian food in Vegas, no questions asked!

I took a client here for dinner on a Thursday night before a night out. We ordered a bottle of wine and the calamari to start. The service was excellent, the wine was presented well, and the calamari was out of this world (I'm a bit of a calamari snob). I then ordered the Chicken Sicilian. I'll make this short...this is probably the best Italian food I have ever had and I used to manage an Italian restaurant. My client was also very satisfied as we were talking about how good dinner was for the rest of the night.

Again, I didn't experience the atmosphere of the main dining room which, from reading other reviews I could see as being kind of cheesy.

First of all if you are staying or gambling at Paris or Bally's, good Italian, real good. Can I get better in Utica, NY or Philly or Brooklyn or Jersey or....mom's kitchen, yeah, yeah, maybe, but you are in Vegas. If you like veal, you gotta try the house Veal Cutlet Martorano. It is spicy with peppers and really sharp tasty cheese. I get veal all over and am a pretty good cook myself, I'm gonna figure this recipe out (steal it)!  I had it with the sauteed greens (spinach) crisp, fresh & tasty. Why not escarole? I was drinking bourbon, so the food review ends there.

Now if you want a little privacy, stay off the rail with all the casino pedestrian traffic. Interior is ok. I don't get the movies or music, give me Italian music, Martorano!

1160877,2015-04-24,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"A relatively new restaurant in between Bally's and Paris, which replaced another Italian restaurant. I will say this place is much better than the previous restaurant, but that's about it.
The decor is very nice, modern with a classic touch, very inviting. It's a restaurant slash sort of night club with a DJ slash bar. When we were in there happened to be a Jazzercise convention in town and all of a sudden 30 women from outside and inside the restaurant went to the dance floor and danced their shoes off. It was a nice touch to the evening. 
5 of us sat at the bar, which ended up be very nice, since we got a corner. 
I will say the whole Yo Cuz thing and life size posters of Steve and him on TV over the bar in a loop cooking just doesn't cut it for me. It was almost a turn off. Seeing a tattooed jacked guy in a tight shirt and cooking with no audio over and over got old very fast. I would rather see a logo spinning or a game on TV. 
To start with the menus illuminate! Very classy touch. How many times is it too dark and you can't read the menu, this is the first time seeing anything like this. Their main menu opens up and it has a easy on the eyes white glow. In addition they have an iPad for drink specials AND food specials. We weren't told about this until after we ordered appetizers as it wasn't clear that there was more to the iPad menu. For drinks I had an amazingly smooth vodka martini, highly recommend it. 
For appetizers we shared the meatball salad, the eggplant stack and the fried calamari martorano. The meatball salad is a great idea, haven't seen that too much however you need to have a good meatball. Not the worst meatball but frankly it was not good. Way too dry and I believe too much pork. They say it was voted one of the best meatballs around, they probably didn't have real Italians try them. Do not get it, you will be disappointed. 
The eggplant stack was good, nice crust on the eggplant again nothing special. Now the Calamari Martorano, that's no normal fried calamari, and this time I mean that it a good way. The sweet and spicy pepper tomato sauce with balsamic vinegar was delicious. The calamari were tender and the plate was full of flavor. For an extra spice drizzle the spicy oil they bring it with the bread! One thing I don't understand is they have a second fried calamari dish, why have two? I would rather see a different dish. 
For the main dish I ordered off the specials (see the iPad). I had the double cut pork chop in a vinegar pepper sauce. The pork was cooked through and through, but more importantly the meat was very moist and full of flavor. It's tough to cook pork all the way and keep it moist and tender, these guys know how. In addition it was a very large portion, as we noticed on a lot of there dishes. 
Have to give credit to the bar back, not only did she clean up and help the bartenders, she served our appetizers family-style and was on top of anything we needed. Made the experience at the bar feel like we had a waitress, nice job.

Before I continue I just want to share my qualifications for even giving a review - I can cook a wide array of foods; from Peking duck, to rib roast with béarnaise, to what has been said is lasagna as good as anything that can be found in northern Italy (with homemade sauce).  
My wife had penne ala vodka, and while the flavor was good, the plated portion was at most worth $18-20, even by Las Vegas Strip standards, not the $28 they were asking for.  I had the Veal ala Martorano.  The ""sauce"" was basically some stewed tomatoes, chunks of garlic and chunks of Chile peppers (Serrano's), some salt and pepper over fried veal.   Now for those of you who enjoy heat for the sake of heat then you might very well enjoy the ""sauce"".  However, I find that spices-heat should not appear out of nowhere like a left jab to the face, depending on which fork full of food you happen to take a bite of.  They should be infused in the dish and add to the flavor, not fight with the other flavors.  That was not the case with this dish.  If you think you might like the dish then I would suggest trying it this way -go buy a Serrano chile and get a slice of pizza.  Then take a bite of each at the same time.  This will save you the $32 cost of trying the ""veal ala martorano"" to see if you like it, although it may be an insult to your favorite pizza.",nVpjmwDsSfnaRxq22QRuFQ,1,0,2,KlRqm42JhZNmO1VTUlkmYA

The life-sized wall posters of the giant tattooed Italian American Cook with his catchphrase ""Yo, Cuz"" along with omnipresent clips of HIS favorite movies and HIS favorite cooking show (himself) should be all the warning you need that you are dealing with a massive ego here.  Oh, if that weren't enough, the entrance to Paris on the Arc has one giant image of Gordon Ramsay and one of this guy.  So, at first glance, I'm thinking, ""Ego, pure and simple, and nothing more.""

I'm happy to say I was impressed by the outcome, though.  Ego or not, this food is good.  Now, disclosure, I'm not Italian, so I'm probably not as harsh a critic as others.  But, I've eaten at a fair share of Italian places, and I know some authentic Brooklynites of Sicilian heritage who know a thing or two about cooking.

This place nails it.  The fried mozz, best I've ever had.  A giant ball of fresh, in-house made mozzarella, thick sauce with spicy peppers, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The bolognese (special of the day while we were there) was literally the best I'd ever had.  I mean, just melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  Cocktails were great, no complaints here either.  

I'd definitely come back here again if I'm ever in Vegas and craving good Italian.  This was well worth the visit.  For Vegas, the prices were actually pretty decent, too.  

It does get a bit loud there, though, especially after 9pm.  They warn you about this, but it's still hard to hold a decent conversation, even with someone right next to you.  Part of the kitsch, I guess.",OYqbkGuG-FksdFhggwljjw,2,0,5,lzSgpugfFICkmP1eND2YUg

Points for lovely design, friendly service, and Strip-central location. 

Review based on bar service only.

I had a very nice time at the Martorano's bar last night.
Very friendly, knowledgable service. Nice lighting and not too Crowded (Wednesday evening after ten). 

I had a house-specialty cocktail called ""Angel"" -an upscale twist on a margarita. Sweet, but I knew that going into it. Followed by a glass of Pinot -Grigio. 

And here's the thing: I was so distracted by the wine glasses, that I almost forgot about the beverage. Rarely have I heard a wine glass ring so beautifully. It was like an alcoholic Tibetan singing bowl. Truly marvelous. 

But the wine: eh..the selection was pretty average -same with beers and whiskys.  The house cocktails are pretty standard for the Strip - as were the prices. Three beverages came to $42 +tip.

And here's the other thing: I love Italian food, and spent many years in Boston's North End - the traditionally Italian part of town. Even the best pasta dish is inexpensive to make, and should not be flamboyant. Simple good food made from fresh ingredient is what it is all about. 

Martorano's is ""production Italian"". More emphasis on presentation than is necessary for such a simple cuisine - with prices to match. The gullible are easy to impress. But again, pretty normal for The Strip.
I'll go back for the hang, and the singing wine glasses. Probably go light  on the food.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,0,3,kZN8FJeozwvTAB5hdzal5A

We had a bad experience, first they gave us probably the worst table in the house, right at the restaurant entrance so parties waiting for their table were standing right over our table. Ok we didn't let that bother us to much. Now the food. My wife ordered the Linguine in white clam sauce, what she got was Linguine soaking in olive oil that taste a little rancid. Neither of us could eat the Linguine but she did eat the clams they were ok..  I ordered the Rigatoni with Sunday gravy recommended by the server. A big chunk of roast pork that was fairly tasty but there was not enough gravy to satisfy my taste so I asked for a little more gravy, the server said he could do that for a  5 dollar cup of gravy as a side dish. ( WHAT ) I did not pay the 5 dollars simply out of principal. I could not finish my plate.

Let me begin by saying the this restaurant has a modern, club like feel. Blue lights, disco balls, sleek bar....and REALLY loud music (I could have done without the last part. The music was so loud I could not hear own waiter and make it difficult to sustain conversation. On the upside, they were playing my jams so I spent most of the time lip singing in my seat as I waiting for my food). 

They provided us with a small complimentary portion of pate on toasted sliced bread. I couldn't hear the waiter, so I can't tell you what is was exactly...whatever it was, it was delicious. Complimentary bread was left on the table with olive oil, cheese and some kind of oil based chili sauce for dipping. I live a gluten free life style and unfortunately they do not offer gluten free bread. (They do however offer gluten free pasta.)

As for my meal, I started with an EXTRA dirty martini which was on point. Props to the bartender. For dinner I ordered the pork chop which was one of the chef specials for the evening. I highly recommend, it was HUGE, perfectly seared and seasoned sitting upon a bed of cooked greens with the most delicious peppers which added the perfect amount of a kick.

The ""gravy"" was simple and delicious, perfect al dents pasta, extremely flavorful meatball, and the final perfect element: that dollop of ricotta.

Aside from the food, the service and atmosphere were also worth the 5 stars! Our server was super attentive, excited to tell us about the food, answer any questions and made a great wine recommendation. (It was their brand that they sell at the restaurants and online which we'll be ordering very soon!). We loved the fun super club atmosphere and you go in looking forward to enjoying this unique fun experience.

My only tip for them would be to make sure the hours are advertised consistently. I went to check out some other yelp reviews while we were dining and noticed it said the location was closed. Spread the word that it's open late & has awesome late night full dinner service!

I can't stress enough how wonderful an experience we had at Martorano's this evening. Server Paul went absolutely above and beyond our expectations.

He couldn't have been more personable, attentive, helpful, and funny. 

The food we orders was incredible. The fresh mozzarella and cherry tomatoes with evoo, sea salt, and a 25yr balsamic reduction came out first, and let me tell you, coming from someone who use to sell fine cheese, this mozz was top notch. The 16oz NY Strip was a perfect medium rare, and the blistered shishito peppers were the perfect compliment. The sautéed greens were cooked perfectly as well, and the risotto may be one of the best I've had.

The sauce was just ok and so was the meatball. The ricotta was really good. The guys that ordered the veal and chicken parm didn't have any gripes but weren't blown away either. I think if you set people up for greatness as the staff does, then you should deliver. That didn't happen. The mozzarella appetizer was good but not over the top delicious as promised.

We finished off with a slice of decadent cheesecake. The entrees are served family style so definitely suitable for sharing - there's not too many side offerings but I've had the sautéed greens before.

This was a great compromise, and I was so grateful they let us do this. Awesome service, both in that regard and once we were all seated. All of our servers were attentive, kept the wine flowing, and were able to talk in an educated way about the food that was being served to us.

There were a couple of pain points though. First, while they wanted us to do family style, they didn't have a policy in place for it. We actually just had to order 3-5 of each menu item, and pay the same price. Not quite what we expected (the manager led me to believe there was a specific family style menu). Second, the food is just fine, but some of it just isn't worth the cost. $30+ spaghetti? It's good, but not quite that good. No one at all in our party liked the

2204945,2017-08-12,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"Our server Paul is the man. He took the restaurant experience to the next level. When you get details about the history, about the mozzarella being made fresh daily, the can't miss meatballs, and his favorites...you are set up for success. 

The caprese salad is bomb. Fresh mozzarella, tomato, crispy basil and aged balsamic. Yes. Get it. That was probably my favorite. 

The meatball is 1 big meatball with a side of a tasty salad. Paul split the meatball for us and some salad, awaited our joy, and we let him know he was right - it's tasty. I wouldn't say the hype is THAT accurate, but it is a nice app. The salad it comes with is a little higher on vinegar which is a nice cut to the meatiness of the dish. 

We also split the spaghetti pescatore - aka seafood spaghetti in a tomato sauce. The pasta here is cooked al dente (firm) and this is how I'm used to eating pasta so I was super happy about it. If you're used to a more cooked pasta, don't be shocked. 

It was too much food. We were both like a package of crescent rolls - a second away from popping. If you're sharing, I'd recommend 1 app and 1 entree. Or 3 apps. 

It's vegas, so somehow this wasn't weird, but they have a dj and disco ball scenario going on in the restaurant. It threw me off because the food quality and service is more upscale, and then you have club music in the background. It didn't detract for us just a talking point. Another, don't be surprised, thing. 

I know I already preached about Paul, but I can't say enough good things about him. He's full of fun facts, is super likeable, and at the end you want to invite him to join your table. 

Good food, great service, dinner for two around $120 (2 apps, 1 entree, 2 glasses of wine).",IeWFnxmk344iIbl5-M5RPw,1,1,4,42Ss9959eKO3PkPXGJfzjQ

My best friend and her family make it a tradition to come to Martorano's every time they are in Vegas and this time, I was the lucky guest that got to learn WHY they love this place so much! I'm not sure why they only have 3.5 stars because I thought it was absolutely incredible from beginning to end and left the most full that i've ever been. HIGHLIGHT: The menus LIGHT UP so that you can see what you're reading! I've never seen this before and it is such a cool concept! :) 

We ordered a delicious bottle of Malbec to start, and enjoyed it along with their family-style apps {that they dish up for you!} and soft and airy bread with parm and dipping oils. For the appetizers, we ordered their famous Meatball & Salad {a MUST! I could probably eat this for my meal}, the Eggplant Stacked made with house made mozzarella {ANOTHER MUST}, and the calamari. We were honestly full after these apps but then the REAL meal came! I ordered the Chicken Sicilian and it was so delicious. Chicken tenders, mushrooms, capers, and hot cherry peppers. Warning, it does have a kick but I love that! The entrees do not come with a side but I ordered a side of spaghetti so that I could taste their famous marinara sauce. The entrees are HUGE and if you order apps, I highly recommend splitting them. I also tried my friend's Veal Piccata and that was delish too! 

All in all, a VERY great experience. Pro Tips: Order an app or two, share entrees and a few sides. This place is pricey and you don't want to be left with a ton of extra food like we were because when you're on vacation, leftovers go to waste! :)",e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,7,5,5,VOXnQvvwYIeuFW0EMjJ_2A

Steve Martorano is painted as a South Philly goon (Posters of him with ""Yo Cuz!!"" in large print are plastered everywhere"") who somehow learned how to cook despite no formal training. You will see his book, his image, and videos of him talking about cooking during your time there. It's like walking into someone's ego. They are really selling this guy's image along with the food.

The Ego would be fine if the food matched it. Or, at the very least, justified the prices.

To make matters worse, the management was completely uncompromising and pretty much ruined my best friend's birthday. 

We had a moderately sized party with a special request to order two meals and appetizers separately from the rest of the group. The waiter informed us that they could not do that and that they WOULD NOT DO anything to assist. He sent a manager over and he said he could do nothing for our request, and due to the owner, appetizers could not be ordered separately from our meals. We explained to two different managers our situation and they regretfully informed us that the owner refuses to make any exceptions in how his restaurant is run. Management did nothing to accommodate, even when the situation was explained to them over and over again. 

If you want good Italian food I can recommend several other places that severely beat this place. Picasso, Sinatra, Andiamo, Nove, Casa di Amore, MAGGIANOS, PIZZA ROCK, BUCA DI BEPPO...literally pick any other Italian restaurant and you will be happier.

However, i do like Carbone's meatballs a little better, just my opinion lol I love nothing more than Italian American cooking from South Philly it reminds me of growing up in Jersey and my grandmas Sunday gravy every weekend. Shout out to Chef Steve Martorano and his commitment to serving the highest quality ingredients and employing a top notch staff. 
YO CUZ!!

Dishes I recommend:
Philly Cheesesteak
Meatball Salad
Sunday Gravy with Macaroni

You know how you go to dimly lit restaurants and the older people in your party can't ever read the menu?! Welp, no problem here because the menu is digital! Fancy! 

I dare say that you will not go wrong with anything you order. Everyone in my party was ecstatic with their meal and raved about it. I had the most divine braised short rib pasta! I still dream about it. The drinks are great as well. 

It's well worth it. I paid for my date and I believe for the two of us ,it was only $200 with drinks. The dirty martini is excellent and I got some sort of pear basil drink that was delicious. Next time wine for sure because the gentleman sitting across from me said it was delicious with his steak. I tried both and he was absolutely right.

Although she passed on to the great kitchen in the sky, I keep her alive by cooking her recipes and enjoying many of the dishes she would make for me.

So why do I begin my review of Martoranos with that introduction? 

Two words - the meatball. Italians do not order meatballs out. Your family's meatball is part of your heritage. No one else's can come close. Or that's how it is supposed to go. 

Sadly, the meatball that Chef Martorano cooks puts my Nanas to shame. That is almost sacrilegious to say but there - I've said it. There's a reason this restaurant is famous for its meatball. It's AMAZING! 

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start with the cool decor of the blue lit bar and the plasma TVs all around the restaurant showing Classic movies or the DJ playing tunes to dine by. 

We ordered the meatball and salad appetizer and were blown away by it. Our waiter also suggested the made-fresh-that-morning fried mozzarella in gravy which was out of this world. 

For our main course my lady had fresh fish over risotto. Loved it. I had veal parm with peppers, onions and gravy that was phenomenal. The side of ricotta gnocchi was light and spectacular. 

This was one of the best Italian meals I ever experienced. Hands down the best meal I had in Vegas in years.

I was excited to try this new location.
My mom was in town so I thought it would be perfect!

It was not perfect, but it was really good. And I am sure once they settle into this new location it will become amazing, like we  are used to at the Rio. The food was good, although it took a really, really long time to arrive. The service was good in a awkward, trying to hard kind of way. 

My mom did not lover her entree, unfortunately. So we asked for it to be boxed up, because she only ate 2 bites. Both the waiter and manager knew she did not like it, and after the long wait, If I was the manager, I would have probably comped it. 

I am looking forward to going back in to have some amazing Italian food.

I will start with another patron was extremely drunk and causing problems he was in the table next to us.  It made it hard to enjoy our dinner.  Secondly, they brought me the wrong salad but they fixed that and brought me the Caesar salad I ordered. The problem is it was bad.  The lettuce had many wilted pieces in it and the croutons were mostly stale.  I usually love their Caesar salad.  I quit eating it and showed it to the servers assistant who was helping our table.

The eggplant stack appetizer was pretty darn good.  The speghetti pescatori was outstanding.  

The prices were not cheap but not out of this world like some of the other nearby places.  If you pay decent money, you want decent food and this was the case here.

Steve was especially busy during our time here because NFL Quarterback, Joe Montana was dining a few tables over.  But he took the time to come over and talk to us.  This was really special to one of us in our party as he is a frequent diner at his Atlantic City location.  He is one huge dude and takes his craft seriously.  It was nice meeting him.

I have never found a restaurant that I loved and hated so much at the same time.  This is an example of a Las Vegas vanity restaurant with an 'experience' I would avoid at all costs but food that begs me to come back for more.

We were seated inside of the restaurant late in the evening, exactly at the time we reserved our table.  The staff were friendly, attentive and professional.  The service staff had spot on recommendations for drinks and appetizers. Stars all around for everyone.

Inside the restaurant was clouded with vanity pictures of chef Martorano in poses that show him as the 'Boss' he apparently is.  Music from the 90s was being pumped through speakers so loud the servers had to shout the specials and signature drinks, and even that was not good enough to hear anything they said. 

Much worse, a string of scenes from Martorano's favorite films were loudly played on TV screens throughout.  Scarface, Rocky 3 & 4, and an old Steve Martin film were forced down our throats as we tried to enjoy delicious cocktails.  Why the TV's?  I felt like we were at home watching bad cable.

The food, however, oh the food!  Are you kidding me?  We ordered four items from the regular menu and specials, and everything was just amazing.  Super fresh, top of the line meat, seafood and pasta.  The standout was a sea bass special, absolutely melt in your mouth perfection.  The pasta was perfectly prepared, just as promised on the menu.

My husband and I like to be adventurous so we started off with the pigs feet. This was a little too fatty for me but the sauce was adequate and it was interesting to try. 

Afterwards, we weren't sure what pasta to get so we thought we'd split the bolognese of the day. The picture on the menu made it look big but when it arrived there was not a whole lot there. I thought the pasta was extremely underwhelming for supposedly ""fresh pasta"". 

Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I decided to order the carbonara which I thought would be better. It wasn't. Pasta still tasted stale to me and the sauce was underwhelming as well.

We have dined most locations more than once; and this was by far the worst experience that we have ever had. Being from Philadelphia and fairly familiar with the cuisine and the restaurant itself. I will have to say that our waitress (Jessica) was excellent and none of it was her fault. We had reservations at 8:30PM and were not seated until 8:40 PM; everyone was crowding the hostess stand. We were finally seated and looking at our menu I order Veal Parmigiana with Gnocchi which I do every location. I was told at first that veal parm is not on the menu but it was on the menu outside the restaurant and every other restaurant that I have been to; but then I was told that they will make an ""exception"". Then moments later I was told that they were out of Gnocchi (I was the 24th order and they only had 23 orders). How do you run out of Gnocchi on a Sunday night when you have it on your menu and you are still open for another 2-3 hours minimum? This is not acceptable for a place that has reservations and is accepting walk-ins. I got my Veal Parmigiana and it was the size of my fist (which isn't that large) and it was very thick and had bones in it (not usual for Veal Parmigiana)  Martorano's was so much better atmosphere, presentation, and family like at the Rio;  at Paris I feel like its get in and get out not enjoyable.",VSjA_hTiD-ZfJgHbsLrkeg,1,0,1,4zYEihX3BMeadeR0bi6ePQ

Make sure you ask for a table inside the restaurant, but not under the house speakers - it was so loud, we couldn't even hear our waitress, who immediately screamed over the noise, ""Yeah, people complain about the music all the time!"" Do they, now?

We started with the Fried Calamari Bibzy ($20), which was a conflict of textures - some of the larger pieces of squid were completely melt-in-your-mouth tender, while other pieces were crazy rubbery - even the waitress quipped about the half-eaten portion when she finally arrived with our drink orders.

The place has a fantastic wine selection, featuring some really nice and inexpensive offerings, including several of our favorites from the Conundrum Winery by the glass - and we received some awesome suggestions from the sommelier, who had to scream his selections over the music. 

My wife's Linguine with White Clam Sauce ($32) arrived under a thick layer of Italian parsley - so much so you would have thought someone dumped a lawnmower bag over the plate. And while the pasta was perfectly cooked, many of the clam pieces were gritty with sand. By the time my wife called it quits, there was such a pile of parsley ""clippings"" floating in the remaining broth, you couldn't see the bottom of the plate. 

The Veal Piccata ($34) was tender and the lemon butter sauce was excellent. Just don't forget to order a side of pasta, because everything is a'la carte - an important fact that was either not shared with us, or we simply missed the detail while the waitress attempted to scream over the music.

Oh, and don't ask for salt or pepper - ""The chef seasons everything to perfection."" Maybe for his pallet, but the veal would have certainly benefitted from a tiny sprinkling of salt.",vz4eJpx3VpIoqC0VobaRDA,3,0,3,4v5Rn4XQDzl3H654U_7dMA

I suggest visiting this restaurant only if you enjoy getting an instant heartburn from house salad dressing that consists out of straight up vinegar, consuming overcooked chicken in Marsala sauce that's saltier than the Pacific Ocean, or washing it all down with a glass of Pinot that must've come out of a cardboard box for $5/gallon. To top off your experience, you will wait 1.5 hours for your course to make its way to your table and your dessert will be unavailable at the end of your meal. We came in with a party of 8 people and not one of us had a single positive thing to say about this place.

The food there is made to order and tastes just like grandma used to make, I couldn't hardly contain myself from ordering more food just to try it. This place has an amazing menu and great quality food, not to mention a very home feel to it, even though its upscsle.

The wait staff is professional, curious, knowledgeable and also very concerned with making you feel like your home. ( as for Paul, our entire menu from drinks to entree were of his choosing and we couldn't have been more satisfied)

To start: the bread and dipping sauces are just amazing. We ordered a homemade mozzarella and tomatoes antipasto, this was to die for! 4 layers of handmade cheese with thick, fresh and ripened tomatoes between them, fresh basil and a 20 year aged balsamic vinaigrette. 
I cannot say enough about it.

We also ordered the chicken parmesan that was on special with a side of pasta and their famous meatball....OMG it was amazing! The chicken was perfect, topped with fresh ricotta and mozzarella, not to mention the fresh tomatoe to round it all out. The pasta, always served (al dente) has changed my view on how pasta should taste and that meatball... was worth every stretched out millimeter in my stomach.

4146532,2018-03-18,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"The food here was disappointing.
The service was good but I would probably not come back for the food. Maybe, I'm just not the right type of customer.
There were there for dinner before going to see the new Inferno magic show.

We ordered, the fried calamari, spaghetti with meatball, carbonara, and cheese steak, and a salad.

First of all, when I order calamari, I expect it to be crispy and temperature hot. The sauce that they put on the calamari made all the pieces soggy. Have you had soggy calamari at a restaurant before? I haven't. This was the first time.

The spaghetti was fine. Nothing special with a giant meatball. For $25 or so for an average bowl of spaghetti wasn't worth it. If the sauce was more flavorful, then sure, but really, I could have made that spaghetti. The carbonara was okay, but I think they must have used swiss cheese, or the combination of cheese they used wasn't as good. It was very strong. I love parmessan, gruyere, asiago, etc. but whatever the combination was - was something that I personally didn't like. The Philly was okay, as well, but nothing special.

Usually price isn't a factor, but when the food isn't great, then it becomes an issue, because it wasn't worth it.

If I had known, I probably would have gone to Maggiano's instead.
Oh, finally, the salad. It was swimming in dressing. I ordered the Maggiano's salad for $14. It was just that - lettuce and some tomatoes. I am being critical in that the world of restaurants has made so many innovations in salad that a $14 salad shouldn't be a small plate of greens with dressing that I could have bought at the grocery store. 

I love great food and expect it when it is billed as a fine dining restaurant. Mediocre is right. I make better pasta at home than this restaurant. I don't think the chefs understand that people's palate's have changed. We're used to eating at so many great pasta restaurants - Nora's, Buddy Vs, Maggioni's, Wolfgang Puck, and a few more - gosh even California Pizza Kitchen, and I'll say Buca Di Beppo have some solid dishes, so this place is a great disappointment.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,0,0,1,ga3up_ANGfu8OeILXEG0LQ

I had the rigatoni in Sunday Gravy (sauce) with pork, and the gravy is very good. I also ordered a side of meatballs (which they give you one large meatball for $12). It was OK, but I have had a lot better and it was certainly not worth the money. The bread served with the meal is authentic delicious Italian bread, served with sides of oil, hot pepper sauce, and grated cheese (although I wish they also included butter as a choice as well). The decor is very sleek and ultra modern, and although it hardly fits the theme of an Italian resturuant, it is a nice looking place. The prices are high for an italian resturuant, but when you take into consideration your eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant, right on the strip, the prices are fairly reasonable.

My daughter had just turned 21 and we were in the mood for some fine Italian food so we made our reservations and arrived right on time. We were seated, but no server was to be found for about 10 minutes. We had no drinks, or water. Finally our server Raymond came over and introduced himself, he was pleasant but dismissive, not even apologizing for the wait. We understand the restaurant may be busy, but maybe more waitstaff should be hired because one server can not handle 12 tables at once. We were looking into getting a bottle of wine and he asked us if we were staying at The Paris Hotel. We said no, but staying at The Cosmopolitan across the street. He kept trying to sell us something we did not want but insisted and made us try it anyway, still not liking it we ordered what we originally wanted. Took another 15 minutes for our bottle of wine to come and be served. 
The whole time we noticed the table next to us was a bunch of high rollers, and got anything they wanted. There was every server, bus boy, sommelier helping them the entire service. Our server was barely present the whole time, and was mainly focused on the table next to us. A sommelier did not even show us the bottle of wine that we ordered. Then it came time to order our food, and we were excited because we heard the food was amazing and it certainly did not disappoint. Our first course came, we got the meatball salad and it was divine. I noticed though that every other table that got salad got it served to them by their server, in which we did not. Not a big deal, but bad front of house service for sure.

Then one of the pasta dish wasn't cooked, And we know more than her one or two things about pasta, She said it should be like that. 'If you wanna change and make a new one it will take you 40 min for a new pasta'. Are you serious !?! She didn't want us to order a new one. 
And so we said yes, And guess what? It took 20 min, half of the time she said. 
When we said we don't want it because of her bad service, She was  laughing on front of our face with the manager.

Overall, the look has a very modern/trendy feel to it, though admittedly a little confusing with the random mob/action movies playing on all the TV's periodically turning up over the sound system for certain scenes, only to fade back into the dj's mix.  Food wise---I enjoyed the meatball over fried mozzarella. The meatball was sizable, tender, delicious and of course fried mozzarella---what more need be said.  My entrée was the lasagna which is better than average, but not necessarily anything to get too excited about.  What I did quite enjoy, however, was the wife's risotto with shrimp and scallops.  Quite possibly one of the best things I've ever tasted.  The risotto was so buttery and rich with each bite--completely flavorful, and the seafood cooked perfectly.

They have several tvs which play old movies and at some point they dim the lights and play loud music. It's a pretty fun place if you are in the mood to party. However, if you are not it can be very dark and too loud for dinner. 

They have a large variety of dishes. I highly recommend the homemade mozzarella. There are a few dishes with it, so you have several opportunities to try it. For my main entree I ordered the tailgate pasta which comes with ground beef, veal and pork. The dish is super meaty and the pasta was perfectly cooked. 

For my dessert I ordered the carrot cake. This dish was good, but easy to forget. Unfortunately they do not have a lot of options for desserts. I felt the five options available were very mediocre.

The service was also ok. The staff was friendly but it took about 45 minutes to get our main entree. Overall, a good option if you are feeling like having Italian food with a great atmosphere.",wtNopFY2ybprzk4FuEbWJQ,2,2,4,kacmuF2fkU1-kqaXIxor6Q

We were promptly greeted at check in, as was every party arriving.  We were lucky to have Paul as our server.  What more can I say than ""wow"" about his professionalism, knowledge and hospitality.  He spoke about the menu with a sincere passion for his role as ambassador to our table.  With items I would never order (vegetarian) he spoke about the menu with such confidence and intimate knowledge that he was sharing an insiders look more than just suggestive selling.

The menu was amazing.  Paul prepped us for a fabulous ride and it did not let us down once.  The freshly made mozzarella made it a necessity to have it to start.  We had their version of caprese and fried mozzarella that was evident that everything was made fresh and with love.  Indeed Paul's presentation of the menu was a love story and homage of the chefs vision and passion. 

Portlons were abundant and full of flavor where you savored each bite.  Penne a la vodka was exceptional and chicken dish huge.  While the menu consisted of fresh and simple ingredients, it was the symphony of flavors and presentation that made it perfect.

Guest of this establishment during V day 2016. Was excited to spoil my gf to fine dinning VEGAS-STYLE.  What we experienced instead was fast food fine dinning at it's best. It took more than a few minutes for our waiter to introduce himself and serve water.   We ordered philly steak sandwich and Shrimp spaghetti. As expected from menu we were asked to be patient for food, as it was ""made to order"".  We received what I felt was market prepared bread everyone boasts about.  

After more than 20min when the food finally arrived I was pissed!!!  The philly sandwhich ($18.00) looked like a complete mess.  I felt that it was purchased from Costco frozen food sandwhich.  The spaghetti was warm-cold not hot as I expected from a freshly prepared entree.  Shrimp was prepared perfectly, wild caught.  The calamari was a F'n JOKE!  It was frozen.....Yo Cuz!  You fed me a frozen entree??????

When it came time to pay this establishment inquired about my experience.  I gave them a ""D"" rating simple fact that it was terrible!

I gave this establishment 2 stars for two reasons; Incredible ambiance & MGR inquiring about our experience prior to completion of our meal.

I guess they have a dance floor as well, since they were playing a lot of 80s and 90s hip hop and dance music.  I liked it, but we did not dance...

You don't want to go here for an authentic Tuscan dish, but if you want some spaghetti and meatballs, or what I had - the rigatoni with short ribs in ""Sunday gravy,"" was amazing. There's a barrier between comfort food and high-end cuisine in Vegas. But sometimes you don't want a $100 steak...some home-style pasta and sauce hits the spot. And at $28 for my entree, it actually was a very affordable place with n upscale feel. My meal at Martorano's was exceptional. Filling and delicious.

My only complaint is that the drinks are ridiculously priced. I paid $28 for my entree and $26 for 2 Jim Beam drinks (their house bourbon). Sorry, but Jim Beam is not a $13 per drink bourbon. Especially when drinks are measured exactly in jiggers and the bartender doesn't have the option of making it a bit stronger to please the guest. I'm not so upset about the booze content except that they weren't able to make a drink to my liking because it was 75% mixer.

Next time, I'll do beer. Safer and cheaper. But overall, love this place. Affordable but still pretty upscale. Down to earth with the food, but the drinks are outrageous.

The decor is nice, black and white. With blue lighting along the bar and the kitchen, which is open (about a 1/3 wall) at the back of the restaurant.

The environment is odd. From the outside it looks like a typical classy restaurant, but once you're in it's a different story. ""Yo cuz"" is plastered all over the place, I'm guessing that's the chef's catchphrase. Several tv's around the room were playing Mystic River (a great movie but would not be my first choice for a dinner - the concept of having a distracting t.v. while in an "" elegant"" restaurant was off-putting) while funk and disco music played a little too loud.

They try to be trendy and modern, the menus are backlit and the server brings over and iPad that he uses to go over the specials and which serves as a cocktail menu/shop/dessert menu, but doesn't actually serve to order.

The servers were very professional and friendly, and provided their recommendations when we asked.

The fried mozzarella stack was very good, but a bit pricey. $22 seemed a bit much.

The main courses were not very good particularly when factoring in their cost. $28 for what amounted to 6 chicken fingers in marsala was a bit steep, and the carbonara, although a generous portion, was not very good either. The risotto was a little too al dente for my taste, although the portion was generous.

I enjoyed my experience over all but I feel like the prices do not match the ambiance. The ambiance looks like a lower class Italian restaurant whereas the prices match something more elegant. I feel like they couldn't decide which direction they wanted to go in. 

I ordered the three course meal paired with wine. For the first course the wine was paired with the food but for the next two courses our food came before the wine. I feel that the wine should have been brought out first so I could enjoy it throughout the whole meal instead of having to wait for it. 

I also wanted to order a coke but our waiter was never in sight. I probably saw every other server but him. He was nice but I just felt he was absent when we needed him. (Side note: I never ended up ordering the coke.)

The food was good though. I started with the meatball which was tender and paired with red sauce and peppers. For the second course I ordered bucatini with red sauce. That was also good and I was lucky enough to have leftovers to take to work the next day. For dessert I ordered their cannoli.

when we entered this establishment, our party of four were seated in the main dinning area, much to our chagrin, we were greeted with a cacophony of music, blasting at extreme decibel levels! really?  it was so invasive, that we could not hear ourselves think, let alone carry on a conversation, between consenting adults.

 i thought obama had outlawed excessive sound torture, were we to be waterboarded next?  also, there were these funky lights, swirling non-stop throughout the room, really? therefore,  a person is not only unable to speak to your guests, but because of the lighting, you couldn't see them! really?
  
as a result, we were moved to the outside dinning area, thank you god!
once outside, we could at least take advantage of our vision, hearing and remaining senses and  engage in the social pleasantries, associated with fine dinning.

our review of the meals met with mixed results; the appetizers of meatball (yes only one) with a salad, was very good, as was the fresh mozzarella.  however, the main courses of eggplant, ordered by two of our party, was over salty and appeared to have been made sometime in advance. this is against their freshly made food mandate, listed by the owner on the menu, really? they were going to return these dishes but since this place is run by a former mafia chieftain, they decided discretion was the better part of valor and life. my meal, chicken sicilian, was one of the worst meals i have ever been served! the chicken was covered in a thick  sauce, which was made of primarily olive oil and grease! the peppers, which were supposed to add spice and flavor were uncooked! so this chicken dish should really sleep with the fishes, which they will also not eat!

I saw at the bar, and was immediately helped. The service here was pretty awesome. I started with the meatball appetizer, and it was soooo good. That is a meal in itself with the bread they give you. The chili oil is really good, too. I didn't finish it all to save room for my main course. 

My 2nd course was the carbonara. They actually being out an egg to mix on top of the hot noodles like traditional carbonara. The noodles had a nice chew to them and the pancetta is really good. It's a rather heavy dish though... I could barely finish half. Needless to say, I didn't have room for dessert..... Even though I really wants to try the tiramisu.

The food was pretty sensational despite it's high prices. ($14 for still water, really?) I had the carbonara, where the yolk was broke and mixed in table side. Our server advertised it as the best pasta on the menu and his description was right on the money.

The environment, however, was extremely odd. In the light up iPad menu, there's an excerpt somewhat warning of the restaurant's unique style of operation. White tablecloths and embroidered napkins suggest fine dining however TV screens playing movies with explicit content, an obscene amount of disco balls and gaudy neon blue lights complete the interior decorations. Very loud music bounces from current hip-hop to 80s pop to 90s r&b, with the occasional pause and dimming of lights to focus in on 90 seconds of the most vulgar scenes of whatever feature film is playing.

One it was not packed and hostess sat us near the outside of the restaurant as if the place was packed inside and that was the only choice. Mind you they knew my husband is a Diamond member. After sitting there and no one offering us any drinks or anything. Finally after 15mins the waiter saw I was upset and I asked him to move us so we can enjoy the restaurant vibe. Then after being moved inside. 3 mgrs standing there doing nothing bug chatting and waiters as well. Just as we were about to leave waiter finally comes over and offers us a drink menu. 
So faster forwarding to our meal. 
We ordered the meatball salad. It was decent. Wasn't dry but nothing great. I ordered penne vodka and husband ordered the chicken parm. My husband is italian from Brooklyn NY. He judges any italian resturant by your chicken parm. We get our food. Husband looks at his plate and asked the waiter where is the gravy(sauce). Waiter says its under the mozzarella. Husband looks under was like what italian eats dry chicken parm. Waiter brings over a tiny side of gravy and husband again says. Chicken parm is suppose to have alot of gravy. Waiter says we can give you a side of gravy but have to charge you. At this point husband just wanted to eat. So he agreed. Get to my penne vodka. TERRIBLE! Penne vodka is my all time fav and growing up with italians back home in NY. This place should be ashamed to call themselves a authentic italian resturant. My pasta was hard the sauce was filled with onions and garlic. 
After a while. The manager comes over and asks how's it going. Husnand states about the Chicken parm. Manager says we serve chicken parm dry like that, just a little sauce under the mozzarella. Husband looked at him and couldn't believe that came out his mouth! 
After all said and done. I left very hungry and with an upset stomach just for eating some of the hard pasta.
So if you really want a good italian resturant. I suggest Pasta Mia across from the Palms, it's not on the strip per say but if you want some good italian good this is your place. Its authentic and delicious! Oh and very afforable!",Le0tTJwS7KP6OgrCWP4cMw,2,0,1,JqDzn98bBLGJKhhbZwOUQg

We visited the new location in the Paris Las Vegas hotel on 10/21/14.  We had walked by it during the day, thought it looked cool...liked the menu...so researched it a bit while sitting at the pool and decided that we had to go, seeing how SO MANY celebs and notable people ranked Chef Martorano's food SO high!  So we were pretty excited to check it all out and enjoy a great meal.

We were seated on time at a table on the 'outside' of the restaurant, so we didn't get that movies on the wall, disco ball in the center kind of experience...but did enjoy the al fresco style dining and people watching in the Paris shops area.

Right next to us was a group of 8 conventioneers, who were a bit loud from time to time and seemed to dominate the service as you will see below.

We were greeted by Georgio (hope I spelled that right) after a good 5-10 minutes of perusing the menu on our own.  He dropped off an iPad with the drink menu, took our ""flat or sparkling"" water order, and explained the specials for the night, which I took note of a seafood selection that he described as a ""seafood party in your mouth""...something about that was both comical and odd...not sure why though.  We quickly found out that the iPad was malfunctioning, if you pressed on anything it would just freeze.  So we were unable to check out any kind of special drink selection (we were thinking martini style special followed by some wine with dinner).  Georgio then became a bit occupied with pouring wine for the conventioneers so we were able to flag down his 'assistant' Jason (I think he was an assistant, or in training or something) who quickly brought us a new iPad.  Georgio then came back and took our order...not asking if we'd like to start with an appetizer, not asking if we'd like a drink, but simply saying ""are you ready to order""...which led to her saying ""yeah I want the martini, the seafood special..."" him looking at me so i had to say ""I want a Manhattan up with Makers, we're splitting the eggplant parm and I'll take the Buitoni Meatball""...just not how you serve a couple in a high end establishment.

So then another 10 minutes passed.  The restaurant was about 70% full and the bar was not busy.  We had no drinks and had been sitting there for a total of 25 minutes.  Jason kept looking and then came over to say ""didn't you guys order drinks?"" to which he promptly went to the bar and resolved..bringing us our drinks moments later.

Our eggplant parm arrived shortly thereafter and I have to say it was AWESOME!!  Probably the best I've had..and was a perfect size to split with a date.

After clearing the plates and then taking a wine order (glasses, not a full bottle) the night seemed to be moving more smoothly....until the entrees.

My entree came out but her food did not.  Jason was kind enough to explain that the food was all cooked fresh to order and sent as soon as it was ready, that they didn't hold anything in the kitchen.  Ok, I'm cool with that.  But who knew a buitoni (think thick linguini) and meatball cooked 5-10 minutes quicker than some seafood (clams, shrimp, etc..seafood party) over linguni?  Throughout this whole process, Jason was super attentive to our needs and seemed to really try and keep things going...while Georgio was busy trying to be cool, pouring drinks for the big convention table, and coming up with cheezy Italian style lines to say to everyone.

The manager actually came over and apologized, and first offered another glass of wine (which we both had a full glass) so we declined..then said ""well, just pick out a desert and we'll take care of it for you""...seemed to me a nice gesture and the right thing to do.

Her food finally came out and I do have to say we both LOVED our meals.  I had the best friggin' meatball ever and she had an awesome seafood dish.  The food at this place is worth every penny of the price.

Jason continued to check in on us, making sure things were going smooth...while Georgio continued posturing for everyone.  Ever see a person who thinks he's a special gift to everyone, and has no clue he is actually really cheesy and borderline annoying?  Anyway...

We went on to split a desert (thinking this was on the house)...tiramisu.  Now, I'm not even a fan of tiramisu but holy smokes..it was AWESOME!!

We were then brought the bill...which of course did not have the desert or anything comped...but at that point we didn't really want to make a big deal and just settled up.  

Funny that on our way out, we asked to have our photo taken and who stepped up?  Yep, Jason!  We thanked him for taking care of us all night and actually tipped him separate, fearful that the tip on the bill would all go to Georgio.  My hope is that if anyone from the restaurant reads this, GIVE JASON A PROMOTION!  He was outstanding!!

I should know, I was there Saturday night with 2 very ""American"" friends from California. They LOVED it. Their review would be 5 stars all the way. I just have had this food so much that it is not unique. Strictly local red sauce grub. I had to explain what ""gravy"" was to my friends - which was pretty funny. I also had to hold my tongue at the ""mark-up"" of Proseco ($15 I pay at the market - $40 at Martorano's) - They gave us a nice tasting of mortadella mouse- it was very tasty.

5654950,2015-10-08,0,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"Martorano's couldn't care less about you - it's all about the 'thug' attitude of Steve Martorano who believes the food is better than reality. The staff has nothing good to say about him.

At the Paris hotel, I had a diabetic blood sugar crash. After starting to recover, I was escorted by the EMS of Paris Hotel to the nearest restaurant with the desire of getting simple carbs into my system. Slumped in a chair and sweating profusely, I had to deal with extensive discussions until the manager finally stated that he refused to let me order anything except exactly what was on the menu. It went so far that I requested a pasta dish from the menu and asked that no ""gravy"" be put on the pasta . . . but charge me full price. ""Absolutely Not"" was the response. It was stated many times that Mr. Martorano does not care about my issues and refuses to make any alterations to any of their dishes - regardless of circumstance. Period.

Aside from this inhumane treatment and outrageous behavior, I was forced to eat Martorano's pasta dish prepared according to 'Steve's' menu requirement. I'm an Italian from New York, my grand parents were from Italy and operated a successful catering business after immigrating to the United States. I know Italian food. I cook and have spent 33 years in the food industry myself, and let me tell you, this food is not authentic Italian. Bread is the most basic aspect of an Italian meal and it should be outstanding. Martorano's bread was absolutely horrible: dry, tasteless and without texture. No kidding, the best part of my meal was the water.  

Even if the food had been good, which it was not, how can people tolerate supporting an individual who is so egocentric that he would rather see a patron in distress suffer than serve a pasta dish without his precious ""gravy"" slathered on top. The tone of everything Martorano is negative, offensive, insulting and stinks of a pompous individual who would rather intimidate his customers and staff than be a beloved restaurateur. Steve Martorano needs to grow up and respect the people that spend their hard-earned money on his over-priced, mediocre food served with an attitude.

Spaghetti noodles were thick and very good as well. The meatball was average. Gnocchi - a waste, I've had much better. 

First, decor was nice but really doesn't match the Paris Hotel feel. 

Our waiter Mark...ugh...the only time he became somewhat ""attentive/friendly"" was when he realized we started questioning the bill and asked for his name. He was nowhere near friendly right from the start. When I asked if there was a kids menu he said no in a condescending tone, like I was asking a foolish question.  A more professional response would be ""I'm so sorry, no we do not."" He asked if we wanted wine.  When a few  (but not all) of us said no, he walked away while my father was still deciding what to get. When my mom said it was my birthday he dismissed it right away but then said a brief (""I really dont care"" tone) ""happy birthday"" when she repeated it.

The only areas that could use a little improvement was the time it took for the order t come out and the presentation of the veal. Other than that this is the place to go for real "" Sunday Gravy"" and good food. It is a bit unassuming when you walk by. However, you need to stop! go in and try the food. I reco the cheesesteak sandwich and the meatball salad. A very generous and flavorful salad accompanies a gigantic meatball and plenty of ricotta cheese. The gravy is flavorful and good. 

On the veal, i would have dressed it up with some gravy over the top of it and some fresh basil and oregano to give it some depth and color. The taste was good. It was tender and not chewy. 

Will i be back, ABSOLUTELY!!!  Already booked a party there.

We didn't order anything to eat, but we came in for a drink at the bar and were pleasantly surprised. The bartenders were super nice, attentive, and knowledgable about their selections. It was nice being able to chat a bit about the different wines they carried and they offered me a few to try based on my preferences. We were impressed.

The decor is interesting with blue lighting and very modern. Not exactly what I'd expect from an Italian restaurant. We came in on a Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy. We were greeted right away when we stepped up and got a seat at the bar. The bartender came over right away to help us.

5855098,2016-07-15,1,u0YYkO2CeD3JFCkR1wSMog,"I have waited two weeks after eating at Martorano's to write this review, in order to take some of the emotion out of my review.  I left there disappointed, because I like Paris Las Vegas so much.  But if you're looking for Italian in Las Vegas, you can do so much better.

It was fairly simple to get a reservation the same day.  People on walk-up at 8PM were told about a 45-minute wait which, on a holiday weekend in Vegas, still seemed reasonable.  Greeter staff was nice.  

Our server was polite, but was very busy in another part of the restaurant.  We waited almost 10 minutes after ordering drinks to get them, and it was only because our assistant waiter (the busboy) saw us looking around, and was alert enough to ask if there was a problem.

Martorano's boasts about their meatballs.  The meatballs get lots of hype.  And the meatball appetizer is OK, but not life-changing.  If you've ever eaten in Little Italy in any city, or at a decent Italian restaurant anywhere that makes its own meatballs as opposed to using those from their foodservice, you'll think the same.  The presentation is nice, but for $20, I expected more from a meatball.  

The food was very good.  Please don't mistake the tone of my review, accentuated by what happened when ordering, for putting down their food.  It's pricey, but it's The Strip.  I had Veal Parmigiana which came with NOTHING for $42. 

My problem came when I tried to order a side dish.  I wanted a side of pasta, but too much tomato is a very bad thing for me, and I was already having it in the veal. The waiter knew this, because I asked for very light sauce with the veal.    I asked if they could do the pasta with just butter or oil and garlic - very simple, staple ingredients in any restaurant kitchen, let alone an Italian kitchen.  I was told NO, right away.  No discussion.  The restaurant has a firm ""no substitutions"" policy.  I explained to the waiter that it was something akin to a food allergy, and he told me there was nothing he could do.  The answer was NO.  So I asked just for some plain spaghetti, no sauce.  I was going to be sneaky and just take the butter from the bread and put it on the pasta.  Guess they were two steps ahead of me, because that wasn't allowed either.  I was going to take the spaghetti with marinara and LIKE IT!  OK - no side dish.  And, it's not as though Tomato was going to kill me.  I wasn't going into shock...just some discomfort.  But, no dice.

The waiter sensed my displeasure, and the GM appeared later.  He apologized for not being able to accommodate my wishes.  He told me that the chef had full control over the kitchen, and he was adamant about there being no changes and no substitutions for anything on the menu.  I asked to speak to the chef, but was told ""Oh, he's not here, he's in Dallas...but he reads feedback comments you leave when you sign your check"".  For the record, as polite as my comments were, he never responded.

It was simply the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  Celebrity Chefs everywhere make accommodations for guest requests that aren't outrageous. I mean, I wasn't asking them to make me gluten-free pasta.  

We ate our entrees - which were good.  Nothing memorable, but good.  We skipped dessert and coffee.

The heavy word:  There are WAY TOO MANY CHOICES for great Italian in Las Vegas - and within a 10 minute walk of this place - for any restaurant to be less-than-accommodating.  I'm not saying you won't have a good meal here; but you can do better.",kHAmsmnPSL7hWLxBVnavlw,3,0,2,GupMXIGicVxbB4mMUT9nPA

This was my first visit to the Paris Las Vegas location, and it did not disappoint.  We started with the Homemade Mozzarella with olive oil and sea salt and it just melts in your mouth.  Then I had the Martorano Salad which was popping with veggies, something I love.  For dinner, I went with the Veal Cutlet Martorano which is topped with San Marzano tomatoes and this dish has an amazing combination of sweet and hot that balances your taste buds perfectly.  The table also split the Bucatini Carbonara, which is full of creamy goodness and the pasta is amazingly fresh.  

This guy knows Italian food and he is a big guy so the portions are quite large.  I see a lot of people on this site reviewing this place as too pricey and that could not be further from the truth.  Each dish contains large portions, even the salads, so pack an appetite.

Food. I ordered exactly the same items as last time. Meatball and salad. It was the same, delicious. Bread with oil very good. Spaghetti Dob also very good. 

Atmosphere....none there were tons of empty tables inside the restaurant where the theme and atmosphere are yet they sat us on top of a huge party outside in the walkway to hear and see all the drunks walk by, so no atmosphere on the patio....again way different than the cool setting at the Rio with Rocky movies and music.",fXdQtOViqAiW9KrJtkAQIg,0,0,3,IjpLFBUOb-jg174qP0apPw
