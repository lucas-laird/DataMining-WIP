709274,2012-05-25,0,0IjBFHFm8M-VPyym-Xrkhw,"Obviously price is something considering their location but on both visits we were pretty pleased with what we got. 
On the first day we ordered a pepperoni pizza with thick crust and it was amazing fresh. The second day, we ordered a slice of the meaty pizza and a sandwich. The sandwich was really great and really filling. 
I'd say the key to getting their food is to get it nice and fresh hot out of the oven. As with pizza, when it sits under a heating lamp, it can get a bit iffy but when it's fresh, it's amazing.",m2cJ4sWz4UWzRR75yYqqsA,0,0,4,-KlAeCEXLeeiLCNHhXGtMw

the place also has salads and bread sticks, pizza by the slice as well as whole pizza specials.

overall the staff was quick and friendly and there is a large dining area behind which had booths as well as table seating.. the annoying part that i remember was that the seats were bolted down to the floor. i kept trying to scoot my chair up....haha  

anywho for a quick, cheap ""bite"", this place did the trick.",3C2gP95BENm01k_-kmSi4Q,0,0,3,yhwNrpPxTzV6asdUW03hGQ

2157807,2015-05-14,1,0IjBFHFm8M-VPyym-Xrkhw,"The food was decent. We ordered the #3 combo and waited 30 minutes for the food to be prepared.  The combo came with a 16 inch pizza, wings, celery, ranch, and a pitcher of soda. We paid a little more than 30$ for everything.

The pizza we had was the supreme, the toppings were plentiful, fresh,  and well cooked. The dough was a little under cooked and the sauce was very acidic. 

The wings we ordered as ""spicy"". They were lacking any form of heat, covered in a tomato type sauce that just tasted of vinegar and the chicken was overcooked/dry. We did not enjoy the wings at all. 

Overall it was a decent meal for us. We decided to bring it up to the room. Next time we will only order the pizza, not the whole combo.",pA9NXgASl86RImkdBtydrA,2,1,3,6jD5pN-VUznXAHmJW9uK1Q

We're normally pretty picky about our pizza and we've been disappointed before with hotel pizza.  But we read the good reviews here so decided to give it a try. We got the meat special. It was $20 on the menu, by the time they added 1.49 for extra cheese, 3.00 service charge, 18% gratuity, and tax, it came out to $30.09. Yikes! They came surprisingly quick despite being on hold for a long time when we ordered (we assumed they were busy so we figured delivery would take a while as well). The pizza was definitely better than we thought but not best we ever had. Next time,  I don't think we'll spend over $30 for a pizza that was just ok.",nXt7BE8p4GXRS6QQhIcTZw,1,0,3,Wv_hPLXwNwN0w3LuYXqYUg

The sandwiches are surprisingly good, at $6-8 each are reasonable for an in-casino meal. Lots of gooey cheese and flavorful meats and condiments. Their veggie pizza is pretty good, with lots of different toppings and a well-made crust. Their salads are large and made with good ingredients, several notches above the salads available at McDonald's for sure but also a couple dollars more. If you're willing to spend a little extra and don't want mexican, it's a nice option for inside the Stratosphere.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,0,0,3,bZwD94lAitfuCYk6j6cqtw

The pizza was actually very tasty, friendly staff, and nice seating area. Although, I've noticed some 'non customers' wandering in there, I don't think that's common. I would've come back again but the line was long and at the front was two young girls that had twenty five questions about every item on the menu. Ahhh, not REALLY the employees fault but there is a way to ask the customer, nicely, to step aside until they are ready to order. It happens though. Not criticizing for that.

This place has one thing going for it, it was there, and where we were.

A long slow line to order pizza was unnecessary, despite a vast menu they did not have much available. and the prices 5.25-$6 for a 1/4 of a pie slice is no deal.

The pizza is self tastes like poor quality bread with some cheese, no flavor no character to the crust nothing. 

There is a small adjacent dining area that has pepper and Parmesan cheese tables.

i really doubt any one plans to eat here, so this will not be read, but in case you are planing to eat here, steer away.",gScmsSCqBeFPp6q9yG5nmw,2,0,1,2UoEEtrheQhf8qEEP27GSw

3896994,2014-05-28,0,0IjBFHFm8M-VPyym-Xrkhw,Hidden gem in vegas. Not overpriced. Good selection and its tasty. The only issue is that this is in the stratosphere and that side of vegas is dead.

4011840,2012-02-28,2,0IjBFHFm8M-VPyym-Xrkhw,"This place is located in the Stratosphere next to the Tower entrance. Only go if you can handle the hobos asking  $5.99 while you wait for Valet...  I'm not kidding-Vegas hobos are bold!

Anyway...we actually ended up here because we were planning on having lunch at the Top of the World but the snooty stuck up hostess made me think twice about spending $12 on a cup of soup.  We thought, ""let's just grab a quick pizza...""  Well, what a mistake that was!  We stood in line for like 15 minutes. We ordered a slice of cheese, pepperoni, and a slice of sausage with peppers and onions and a Ceasar salad.  The servings were generous but the quality mixed.  The cheese pizza...yuk, lets just say I've had better frozen pizzas than this.  It was this mattress of goop-I wouldn't even call it cheese-it was bland and disgusting.  The pepperoni slice and the Caesar salad came 15 minutes later because they were out of pepperoni pizzas.  So that was totally annoying.  It was super greasy and slimy.  The Caesar salad?  Kinda hard to screw that up. If you've had a side Ceasar salad at Wendy's ...basically the same thing but pricier.   The sausage pizza was the better of the three.  Oh, and did I mention after we got our meal there was no where to sit?  We waited a few minutes with our plate in our hands, regretting ignoring the biz itch hostess, coulda had a view and a nice comfy chair instead of this mediocre, slow service, horrible tasting pizza joint.  Afterwards, we went upstairs to the tower and they had a little sandwich shop there, with no lines and a panoramic view of Vegas!  What can I say, when you know better you do better!

4999260,2010-02-26,2,0IjBFHFm8M-VPyym-Xrkhw,"Like Karyn M, the only reason we came here was because of a free pitcher of beer with the purchase of a pizza.

Who would have thought that this podunk place in a podunk casino would end up serving one of THE BEST pizzas I've had in in years?  No joke.  And I'm picky when it comes to pizza.

Thin crust, but not so thin that it has that cracker/flaky consistency.  Just enough heft to support the generous toppings.  Toppings were clearly fresh.

Only thing keeping it from the fifth star is, well, the setting isn't exactly five star quality.  So let's call it 4.5 stars.

You know what?  It's probably worth a special trip JUST FOR THE PIZZA (maybe not if you're a local, but hey, maybe even then) If you can find the little coupon for the free pitcher of beer, then bonus points.  I mean, this is Veags:  take what you can get before it all gets snatched away.",uhOmmaB3qFi-QsPfQKg3ww,6,5,4,20sSkRNWX5RfWTCxD2TnGA
5305567,2017-03-03,0,0IjBFHFm8M-VPyym-Xrkhw,"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST BUY A FROZEN PIZZA!

By far the worst pizza I have ever eaten. All I ordered was a simple cheese pizza with buffalo wings. I got in return was a burnt crust with a glop of cheese in the middle;with ricotta cheese pooped and drizzled around the damn glop of cheese for some reason. I can't even start with the chicken. First, it was hard as a rock and tough. Then the sauce just made it worst! Its like they had jars of Lucas Candy and put that onto the chicken. Out of the $25 I spent, I managed to eat the celery that came with the Lucas Flavored chicken.

Please save your money, and might as well put a $20 bill in a slot machine and bet all. You will have more satisfaction.",U_otYq8o2Q5nSlkD22nldg,0,0,1,Uu1RBI8xfRC0ATcncaEzVw
