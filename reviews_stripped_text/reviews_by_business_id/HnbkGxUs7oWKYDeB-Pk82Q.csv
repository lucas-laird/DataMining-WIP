Prices are a little high (it is after all yet another ""Shoppes"" area of a high-end casino), at $5.50 for a single scoop, you have to expect better. The service wasn't great either. I went twice and, each time, not ONE of the five staff behind the counter greets or even acknowledges you. There is a sign stating where the line begins, but it's next to a column that, when the store gets busy, really does nothing to help the line form. On my second visit 12/28/12 at 11:00pm, we ordered a crepe but were rudely told by the girl behind the counter, ""we don't make crepes no more tonight""...ciao honey",XOaI9R06TfnIrrgB1GtKIQ,0,0,3,wvA2E0sVc172YHtr2tSJFA

When I tried to order my crepe and smoothie they got my smoothie order wrong.  That alone would have been fine, but when I pointed out to them that that was not what I ordered they called me a liar.  Another staff had to step in to tell the girl behind the register to back down and make me what I asked for.

The crepe wasn't bad, the fruit on top was good.  The smoothie actually wasn't great, I asked for some kind of mango smoothie, the wrong one they made me was strawberry and after drinking the mango one I wished I'd have taken the first one they made me.

Don't recall exactly what I paid but it felt steep for what it was, pretty meh food, and unprofessional service get 2 stars in my book.",kl50dI9QWFEBSmESDYvGqg,0,0,2,_tz0z4z3WWBxhT3OMLJBoQ
78050,2011-08-30,0,HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q,"I work at the Palazzo/Venetian Casino in one of the shoppes here. So this is my everyday cafe. I eat here everyday even on my days off. It's always super clean, and I'm never disappointed when  I leave this place. This food is delicious, I've had they're wraps, sandwiches, and pizzas. They're coffee is just impeccable!!

    I notice people are complaining about the prices...Seriously? It's in Las Vegas, NV, one of the top tourist locations in the WORLD. It's also located in a Hotel/Casino, its like buy something at an airport. Also, the Casino is located ON THE STRIP. But, I'm just saying. I've only lived here all my life....

    And that guy who mentioned that illy is cheaper in Italy, well no crap Sherlock. Of course it will be more expensive some where else because it is imported. It's like whole sale, you buy a bulk of something then you sale it at a price where you can make profit, enough profit where you can buy some more product and to keep for your company; to pay your employees and the bills etc... Come on you're running a business, that location at the Palazzo was just not given to them with free rent...

    And of course its called Espressamente illy, its an illy company, concentrating on illy coffee. All the pastries they order from a restaurant at the Palazzo, and as well as the gelato. You can't blame the cafe for it not being good that day. 
    For the people complaining about it being to busy, you have to notice that the cafe is right by a convention center...Of course it will be busy.

    As for the coffee.. It will depend on the Barista who makes it for you. All of the employees might be briefly trained about the machines, but you can't expect them to make it all the same. For the original Baristas, it not only depends on how they make the coffee but the way the calibrated the machines as well. 

The Barista's I recommend: Guillermo, Jennifer, and Samuel..

    And if you just think that illy coffee just does not taste good, read they're mission statement..  (illy.com)

    And please don't think that because I work at the shoppes that I'm just making it up, I've actually started coming to this cafe way before I started working at the Palazzo/Venetian shoppes..",4bSqdBMkC7k6HBFOMS5GUg,1,0,5,T2bEc-4T57MPMerwoXStgg

194194,2011-05-18,2,HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q,"Amazing selection of gelatos!

You know the expression ""your eyes are bigger than your stomach""? Well, everytime I go into an ice cream parlor and see a looonnngg stretch of various flavors, I get excited and start imagining getting a multiscoop behemoth to eat. All by myself, too!

The gelato counter is the first thing you see from the entrance, and all the bright colors are just dazzling. Once you get over the hypnotic display, you take a closer look and realize just how many different flavors there are.

I was torn between the amaretto or the tiramisu flavors, but ended going with the tiramisu because it had a certain ""bite"" to it. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it was laced with a bit of marsala or some other alcohol =).  I only got one scoop because I was full from dinner, and I was a bit startled by the sticker shock. Almost $6 for one scoop??

Then, I got the scoop and it was pretty big. In fact, my single scoop almost looked like the size of my friend's double scoop! 

The gelato itself was definitely rich and creamy; everything you look for in a good gelato. It had tons of flavor (along with the ""kick"" mentioned earlier). I would definitely recommend that you try out the tiramisu flavor if you stop by.  Also, a single scoop is definitely enough for one person, because I couldn't even finish mine completely (and I can eat a whole Ghirardelli's Square sundae by myself).  However, I think that is due to the richness of the gelato itself.",HQ6YepQ4uk3ztsa1Ommshw,3,3,4,6vaSxBo6uJeTqcx1IL3efg

My husband and I stayed at the Palazzo just this past weekend and I was totally craving gelato. And what do I see on the corner next to the shoppes.. THIS HEAVENLY GELATO SHOPPE.

Let me just tell you- FLAVORS GALORE!! I couldnt pick! I must have tried almost every sample and they were all so heavenly. And because of the many flavors, for a quick second I was truly disappointed that on their pricing menu they only priced 1 or 2 flavors (thinkin to myself, but what if I wanted 3 flavors?). So that disappointment quickly ended when I saw the person in front of me order two scoops- their scoops were HUGE! Of all the gelato places I've been here in SD, theyve typically given us miniature scoops in a cute little bowl. Ooh haayL not here buddy, they were super generous!!

Since we just had italian food, I didnt wanna go too crazy with all the different flavors they had so I chose Pistachio and Hazelnut and oh my goodness, it definitely hit the spot.

From now on, this will be a MUST STOP for me everytime I head out that way. I HIGHLY recommend you try this place- Im tellin you, its truly worth your time.

I wanted the pina calada gelato but they didn't carry the favor. I had the passion fruit gelato but didn't like it... too sour... My friend had the watermelon but it tastes a bit watery... maybe because my passion fruit tasted stronger. I wanted gelato again the next day and went to Tintoretto which is located at the far entrance of canal shoppers and had much better gelato. Their gelato is also less pricey which is a little under $5 including tax and sugar cone!",nLuNaKK2mXrqBM2M9ikXMg,0,0,2,Syynwlo5iGBqS46T8e7fdA

I asked what they were known for and he said the caramel macchiato, I agreed. I wanted food but I had shown up too late, that's okay no problems there. But simply the way he talks to customers and the coffee he makes... Makes this review a 5 star. By far the best drink I've had in long time.

My husband and I have looked everywhere and  tried coffee offered in many different shops and hotels (there was a Coffee Bean right at the entrance to our hotel rooms); however, our search for a good decent edible cup of coffee as a pick me up was met only with much disappointment.  

Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we stumbled upon Expressamente in the passage way between Palazzo and Venetian... We didn't have much expectation when we first found this place b/c of the disappointments in our prior days of search... But man when I had a sip of their latte, I had a sigh of relief ... We finally found a cup of coffee that is at least edible and enjoyable - with nice coffee bean taste instead of just pure sugar/cream taste or burnt coffee taste... Finally, a piece of heaven :)

My husband is much pickier of his coffee... he's a third-wave coffee hipster or what you may call a coffee connoisseur...tho the coffee here still didn't meet his standard... At least it filled my craving and need for a cup of edible and enjoyable coffee. So I'd say if you can't find anything (coffee wise) you like in LV, try this place ;)

Coffee is not the accent here, it's less than a third of all the ""stuff"" they sell - the coffee should be split from the food service, which takes them much more time. In my case, the guy who should have been running the pass disappears into the back room, and the cashier happened to notice I was standing there and came down to call out the numbers of the stuff he left.

It's Vegas, everything is marked up, so get over it. 2 scoops of gelato will run you $8.08 (tons of flavors and very hard to pick just one), and lunch specials (paninis, salads, etc.) start around $15, I believe.",4pzr6KuS85859EICMI7MDw,2,2,4,q8KVKnsAOwYyKZWq7-wIFQ

""Well, it depends on what kind of coffee maker you have.""

""We have regular. What do you want?""

I  had spent 4 days in Vegas doing nothing but eating, drinking and people watching and I had passed by the espresso place with the massive line many many times thinking, ""I'll come back to you."" I finally did during my last day and decided on the crepes and espresso side of the counter instead of the gelato line. 

The 20+ flavors did a great job impressing me and obviously the 15 people in line in front of me so with a heavy heart, I decided on a strawberry/chocolate crepe and an aranciata. I'm not a huge crepe person because they tend to be slathered in chocolate and drowning in sugar which these were not thank goodness. They were crispy on the edges, warm and each bite had an even strawberry/chocolate/crepe ratio which made for a great dessert. I'd never had Illy desserts before but after today, they proved their handiwork with crepes are as good as their espressos.",QjNjVF-ZdWr-P4zUzXwpVA,1,1,4,FLSQ5LbRn3674KAnJY0U_A

I recently came to Vegas during the July 4th weekend and our first order of business upon arrival was to drive to Palazzo for Illy ice cream at Espressamente. 

For Friday mid afternoon, the place was already packed and we waited 10 minutes in line. It's located inside the 1st level of Palazzo's shops, near the casino entrance. Specializing in European style coffee, pastries, made to order dessert crepes and Panini sandwiches, their delicious and beautiful window display of artisan crafted gelato is what attracted me to this charming eatery. 

With so many unique and luscious flavors to choose from (50+ flavors), it was difficult to decide. There friendly and helpful staff allowed us to sample some of their favorite and popular gelatos. We ended up getting a double scoop on chocolate waffle cone of pistachio, tiramisu and mango gelato. The gelatos were amazingly delicious and silky smooth. Although they were a bit pricey ($8 double scoop with chocolate waffle cone), it was definitely worth it. 

Recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth and love desserts. Remember you're in Vegas so splurge a little. I can't wait to come back!",M6id0az7Q4wJUZyZHibkTg,2,0,4,woVX277AVMApdj6xrym4Qg

I don't know how judge this place.  I've clicked back and forth between 3-stars then 4-stars then 3-stars then 4-stars over and over again.

SO WHAT?  HOW WAS IT?
There's no secret to this place. It's a high-priced, semi-exotic coffee, gelato, crepe, and panini shop.  It's just a branch of the Illy shops in Italy and the rest of Europe.  The difference of course is that even with the exchange rate, coffee in frickin' Milan doesn't cost as much as in the Palazzo location.

The sandwiches do sort of remind me of salami sandwiches that I'd get while travelling from Milan to Torino or Cervinia in Italy.  But none of them are really very good.  The gelato is the same.  All melt too quickly and there's less of a selection compared to Cocolini's.   And none of them really stand out.

THE CRUX IS THEIR COFFEE:
Speaking as someone that travels to Italy often, going to Espressamente Illy for coffee at the Palazzo is kinda like going to a McDonalds in Japan.  You start thinkin',  ""Who in got's name pays $8.99 for a gotdamned Royale with Cheese?""  Then when you taste your burger, you find yourself goin', ""WTF?  This ain't no McDonald's Royale with Cheese.""  And then you eat it anyway.  Because you spent $8.99 on it.

Coffee at Illy IN ITALY is really good pretty much across the board:  Smooth & lip-smacking tasty.  Italian coffee in general puts Starbucks' liquid burnt umber to shame.  Nothing beats having a cup of hot Italian coffee off the ridge of an untouched mountain of frost in the Italian Alps before you snowboard down it and cause an avalanche subsequently burying the rural village below and creating mass hysteria and mayhem.  Just like the Green Goblin.  Yeah.

But I digress.  This Palazzo shop doesn't represent Illy coffee well, I'm afraid.  I get the feeling that they don't change the coffee as frequently as they should because cups of coffee here frequently taste a little bitter and have a bit of an acidic aftertaste.  Very un-Illy like, IMO.

But on the other hand... it's the best coffee available.  I mean, you don't wanna go to Starbucks and their hideous Crappuccino, do you?  You'll be hard pressed to find a better cup elsewhere on the strip.  And every time I cross over from the Palazzo to the Venetian to play Blackjack, I get a cup to go.

CONCLUSION:
Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father.  That's the only secret insight I've got to share with you because Espressamente Illy has no secrets and is pretty much a ""what you see is what you get"" kind of place.  It's just a plain, ol' ordinary late night snack shop - not really at the same level of quality as its Italian brethren.   I come because it's on the way to my blackjack tables.  You'll probably come for some reasonably good coffee if you dread Starbucks... but that's it.

We were tempted with LAVO's dessert selections, but i kept insisting on trying this place out to my friend because of yelp... I have officially become a real yelper where my world revolves around reviews I have read and my bookmarks that I try to follow!!!

The place is definitely cute and bright.. nice decor.. very modern.. it is right in front of the Palazzo fountain where the mini shows are held at certain times.  We just in time beat the long line.. As for the gelato, I've had better.. We sample tasted few of the fruit flavors such as mango, lime, pineapple but it wasn't as sour as i wanted those flavors to be.

It was expensive though.. about $10 for the strawberry and nutella crepe with additional strawberry gelato ice cream on top.. It's okay it was good. A bit too strawberry jammey for me though inside of the crepe.  My friend had some pastry which was very light.  It balanced out the super sweet crepe i got.  I expected more out of this place and more variety in desserts/pastries so I was a bit disappointed.  We would of preferred staying at LAVO to eat desserts.

There was a little boy roaming around the venue though.. He was all by himself. We felt bad because he sat at the table next to us all alone.  He seemed very mature for his age, drinking his tea and eating his gelato.  The workers there were very hospitable to him.  I think his parents leave him alone too much to go off gambling... :( bad parents... all i wanted to do was to tell him to join us.. haha but if he was mature as he seemed.. he wouldn't of talked to strangers!!!!",GqzoKYXv6F1O85bhywyoSA,3,1,3,OMg4_VJx60XHlydOMzyy6Q

The half and half drink I always order just seemed WAY too sweet and the service is rude.  We came here on a Saturday night during the New years weekend and the place was crowded with at least 20 people in line.  There were about 5 people working that night and I can sense the tension amongst the workers.  Then again, who wouldn't be stressed out during a major holiday weekend?

After I got my drink, it was overly sweet and wanted more ice in it.  I asked the first guy behind the counter for more ice and he pointed towards the other female barista.  I walked over to her and she gave me this angry look.  She said she was busy and had to serve the other customers first.  I asked again after she was done serving that other customer and she argued why I need more ice in my cup.  I told her it's because the drink was too sweet and she argued back saying that's the how it should taste.   I asked her to just give me extra ice and she finally hands me a cup of ice.  

Yes I understand people working during the holidays are stressed out but why argue about a simple request such as extra ice?  It's not like I asked her to make my drink all over again.  All she had to do was hand me a cup of ice.  Done.  Simple.  

If a family of 4 orders drinks/gelato here, be prepared to spend close to $30.  It's not cheap but you get pretty good quality for what you pay.

The Spumoni was true to taste and there was an even portion of flavors, there wasn't too much or too little of one flavor (flavors included pistachio, chocolate, and strawberry).

Having frequented Illy many times while shopping and looking for a pick me up in the Grand Canal shops I have never eaten here.

Today this changed I decided to try their crepes. I ordered the Au Chocolat style from the crepes menu, plus a cappuccino Viennese. It so fancy for added whip on the Cappuccino. I decided to dine in since I was in no rush today. The crepes were good, but not the greatest. The Cappuccino as always Illy delivers in the coffee department with shining stars. 

The crepes they put way too much chocolate in the crepes. Plus it is canned chocolate and not real. The crepes themselves were cooked very well. By themselves the crepes would of been much more enjoyable without the chocolate. Either way the whip cream did leave a nice presentation for the crepes when served.

The staff was very friendly and pleasant. They are up on all the coffee lingo and will aid in questions of what is in this coffee and such. They provide very fast service for the food too delivery to the customer.

The dining area is very comfortable and all the tables were clean. They have outlets for charging out mobile devices by the front door. The music that plays is very soothing and relaxing.

Nonetheless, you have to give Espressamente credit for its offerings which are quite extensive.  If there were one by my house, I would be a regular.

They promise to offer the most authentic Italian cafe experience outside of Italy: they charge extra if you're going to use their cups, just how it is in Italy (shit, if my mom and grandma was with me, they'd stuff those cup and saucers in their fake Louis V bags.........go to mama's house and you'll see a slew of plates from various restaurants).

I only had the affogato (amazing!) which is typically a scoop of vanilla gelato topped over an espresso. It blends perfectly together and it pumped me up  for a baby-making project, especially when I saw that dee-luscious guy perusing through reports and sipping on his latte, mmm! Caffeine takes over where Cialis fails (not that I need it anytime soon; for all my third-legged bunch who are uber caffeine-sensitive like myself, you know it hits that area well). The espresso was rich and had the right notes to complement the gelato; it's coffee-flavoured ice cream, basically, for all you Starbucks folk. In addition, they have crepes and even more lattes, more gelato flavours, and espressos which I'm sure are phenomenal.

As for the gelato, it tasted like any other I've had: soft with little to no air and is creamier than the creamiest creams, haha. I was so drained that day after attending a convention nearby and this was a perfect spot to unwind and recharge.

So I was craving dessert like crazy in Vegas and especially something cold and creamy with it being triple digit weather there at the time. I initially wanted to check out Serendipity 3 and their frozen hot chocolate after I had been reminded of it by my friend Sally. But that never happened as Camellia C. said she preferred to go to New York for the original Serendipity.

Anyway, walking around the Palazzo to kill time after a big brunch at Bouchon had me fiending for gelato to cool down.  

At Espressamente Illy, two scoops of gelato will cost you around $7 and with that you'd think you'd get some pretty good gelato. It wasn't the bad but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Maybe it was because the Spumoni scoop was mixing with the Mango scoop to create an not so flavorful mixture of tastes. I still cleaned those bad boys out as the scoops are definitely on the small side. Which totally sucks when you just overloaded on the Rio Carnival Buffet's gelato bar the previous night. 

I wasn't going to leave Vegas without checking out at least one dessert place but I ultimately left unfulfilled and will have to come back to scour out different places for gelato/ice cream next time.",fiAIkO371It7iR-BdOHPGQ,12,11,3,xVQQYVIn9ON2VD7Ft28Quw

As a tip, we tried to order the latte with skim milk and were (sweetly) told that they recommend whole or 2% milk with their espresso...so we added the fat and enjoyed every second of it.

For $5.50 you can have one scoop of gelato. Their flavors are great, however, with an abundant variety. Take advantage of the samples to narrow down your choice unless you want to pay nearly $8 for two scoops.

I would not recommend this spot if you plan to get anything other than coffee.",YO-YOcGsIw34Cr4tgZvNGA,0,0,3,i8lbr8F0EUapI_VyHgVjKg

I'm particularly picky when it comes to coffee and to be quite honest I haven't had a decent coffee in Las Vegas since I've been here until a few days ago,my husband and I drove into the strip to see a show and we stopped here for a quick pre show snack. The coffee was made perfectly as a proper cappuccino should be, so good in fact I had two. We also purchased two crêpes which were amazing. I just wish it was closer and I'd be here daily for my caffeine hit.",RovFDxh78h2dcaijmYdRAw,0,0,5,AwPP9xR-JFIFfSWXeU03MA

I've also never seen such an array of gelato flavor options. Gotta try them all.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,4,3,4,5aUryR40yisNk262zNWeJg
