We decided to try Rustic and was disappointed. We ordered A medium pizza that was ok, but the crust was very dry. Garlic cheesy bread was great. Ordered two sodas that were almost warm when our food was delivered and they forgot my chocolate cake! So much for using a delivery service. My advice, maybe try someplace else. I sent a message to the business that did reply and credited my account for the cake, I appreciated that, but why pay for a service, and tip, if my order was wrong anyway? I might as well have saved the money and gone somewhere else.

Then, the manager reaches out and says he's sorry I gave him a poor review. The owner reached out to me and asked me to never dine w them again because of this review. That's a pretty big statement and says a lot about this business.",0H5Sd4xy_P_Nnu2dsURg8A,8,0,1,VJfyPw8hu_Nzio0N2tuYUw

The Philly cheesesteak pizza is my favorite!  My kids love the chicken and fries. Generous portions, clean and great staff! Our family's new favorite!
Update: still loving this amazing place!! From New England.. Miss the pizza and food so much.. But this place makes me feel like I still live there. If your from the east coast and miss great food..

Once the driver arrived he told me i would either get a refund or my food not both also was very rude about it.

The pizza could have been a little hotter but they put it back in the oven for a few minutes and it was fine. Pizza sauce needed a bit more flavor but all in all I was satisfied.

The pizza crust is done to perfection with a golden brown crispy crust on the bottom while still being a bit soft on the top, which I love. I recommend the Bombay which is a curry chicken pizza with pineapple. (It sounds odd at first, but it's delicious!) My husband liked the German beer they had on tap. I tried the Radler which is beer mixed with sprite - different but I really liked it. We both loved the tiramasu, too.

404903,2016-11-24,6,4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg,"DO NOT CONSUME FOOD HERE. You've been warned. Came here for a second time, the first time was a take out order and I did not see them preparing the food. This second time was a nightmare. I observed the woman preparing the food with her bare non-washed hands. When I pointed it out the man at the front got very defensive!

I let it go and continued to wait but saw her touching meat products and then touching other products all while not washing her hands once. Me being a vegetarian my fear of cross contamination kicks in and I again speak up to the man working the counter only to then notice a DIRTY damp towel laying right next to the loafs of bread I ordered for my eggplant sandwiches. The man goes on to throw the bread in the trash and puts on gloves to give me new bread (all while not washing his hands first after he had just taken a cash payment from another customer) so at this point we are both frustrated with each other I'm sure. 

I then ask if he could kindly clean the space he was attempting to prepare my food at as it was clearly and obviously filthy. This place does not clean after each order. Truthfully I don't think they clean at all. Needless to say I will not be dining here again.

Oh but I'm not done, after I asked him to clean the space he then tells me he was not going to do that and that he would give me a refund because the health inspectors come to inspect their business. Clearly they were not observing the same things I was. I expect my food to be prepared with clean hands at the very least if I'm choosing to spend my money on your food. A sanitary space to prepare my food would be even better. 

The man was very angry and upset that I called him out instead of apologizing and making the proper corrections. He rather lose a customer then own up to the fact that the kitchen and the cooks are very unsanitary.",ltGk9gDqE1zBWNF98WHDvg,8,0,1,-6klUMIrslnOsNN4E4q7-g

A  friend of mine and I went there and ordered a 1 topping pizza and chicken fingers combo for lunch.  
 
Their pizza is a thin New York style crust which is my personal favorite pizza type. When the pizza came and I picked up a slice, I had to tilt it to the side to let the pepperoni juice slide off my piece. Greasy

The chicken fingers we ordered kind of fell flat as well. The breading was hard, even with the sauce on it and was a bit crunchy for my taste. The buffalo sauce also was put on very hastily so there was dry parts on some of the fingers and the sauce was coming apart in the bottom of the basket. More Greasy.

On a positive note, the people working there were very nice and the food came out really quick but it didn't make up for the food.",zFszUTKwfFIWK6EAYCyR7Q,1,0,2,_fVlmOsPHx0MyMySX5cmbw

1068105,2014-12-20,3,4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg,"Don't know what's going on here but the service and food used to be top notch - not so much anymore. Ordered two gluten free pizzas and a bucket of wings for pick up. I show up 15 minutes late and the pizzas aren't ready. So I wait 10 minutes and they go to box it up and one of the pizzas is MIA. I can see the staff looking for the second pizza and then I see one of the cooks pulling a GF pizza dough out to make the missing pie and I almost flip. You've got to be kidding, right?!? Now I'm supposed to wait another 20 minutes?!? No, don't think so. I told the staff to forget it, I'm done, credit me the missing pie and give me my food. I've got kids waiting at home. So they credit me $20 for the missing pie and a little extra for the wait. I was not happy but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, this was the third time in a row they've messed up my order. To add insult to injury, the cost of a bucket of wings went from $22 to $34. I looked online at the Sunset website before ordering and learned upon arrival that 'Sunset Pizzeria' is now 'Rustica Pizzeria' with a new menu and new, higher prices. Diners be warned. 

Heads up to the pizzeria staff - while there is no expectation that a gluten free pizza served in a regular pizzeria is truly gluten free, once you've placed a gluten free crust on a wheat flour coated prep table you've completely contaminated the gluten free crust.",ygZ_yDgjefLs-Qnfr53EGw,7,0,1,rR69LDjmqWuzVqC0s9B5iQ

The bruschetta was fresh and came on thick slices of bread that wasn't so crunchy it was cutting your mouth. The pizza was the best part of course. Not too thin, but not too thick. Only thing that could have been better was the customer service. The lady waiting the table area was friendly, but the lady at the register where you first order seemed bothered by us coming in at 8:15 for dine in when they close at 9. We almost felt as if we were inconveniencing them because of her demeanor & how she made sure to mention the kitchen takes last orders at 8:30 & questioned again if we wanted dine in. We had our pizza at the table by 8:35 & we're walking out the door a few minutes before 9 (the table that came in before us was still sitting there while we were leaving) so I didn't really understand what felt like emphasized concern on closing times.

I order my kids the cheese pizza and ordered myself hot wings and the anti pasta salad. Their pizza was just  so so, yummy crust, but that is all. My hot wings were just gross, soggy and WERE NOT SPICY and had no red sauce on them. If they had run out then call and say so, ill gladly find something else to order. The minimal amount of franks hot sauce they did add, was watery and nasty. The salad as what happened the first time I ordered from here was overly oily and it wasn't really anti pasta just a salad. No banana peppers no pickled veggies, just lettuce and far too much tomato.

2625303,2017-04-06,0,4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg,"My first time here after seeing the menu at the car wash up the street; it's kinda late and I'm not up for fast food so I thought I'd give it a try. 

When I got inside the place was pretty empty - just one guy sitting at a table - but it was already 8:45 and they close at 9 (sign says).  I knew I wanted to get my food to go and get home so no big deal. I was greeted by a gentleman who told me someone would be right with me; after a minute a lady came over to take my order.  Places my order with no problem and went to sit down.  As I turned around a couple came in to sit down to eat and they were promptly told ""we're closed!""  This is kind of a turnoff for me - the hours say 9, the open sign is still lit.  I've been a server before and always hate that last table that arrives 1 minute before closing time, but it's the service industry life - you take care of people. It sucks but you never know - could be a great tip, could become regulars, could mean that when people see others in your store then more start to come in and join them. 

On to my food....  it came out quickly - less than 10 minutes wait. I ordered the spicy meatball Parmesan grinder and a small antipasto salad with the ""homemade ranch.""  The grinder had 4 giant meatballs that are either really homemade or they're really good convenience product. The sandwich is cut on top and stuffed rather than split down the side, keeping by the sauce and meatballs in place. 

The small antipasto salad was adequate for two people and topped with pepperoncini, sliced black olives, tomatoes, cucumber, sliced red onion (way too many onions!!) and a stack of deli meat and cheese. It was ok, certainly nothing special. There was probably one or two slices of each meat and a little provolone cheese, rolled up and then kinda sorta sliced - but not cut through so it really just felt like a giant string of meat.  It needed more cheese, and would have been better if the meat was a little thicker to give it that meaty consistency. The lettuce was iceberg - nice and crispy - but way too wet. I appreciate that they washed it, but the bottom of my salad was swimming in water.

 I've tried their Chicken Parmesan without the bun and it's delicious.  My boyfriend loves their calzones he normally gets Ham & cheese for lunch.  We like the how friendly the service is.  Pauline and Chris have quite a gem. It's clean, quiet in the afternoons so it's a great lunch spot. We just enjoy our food and watch TV.

Today (9/8/13) is our 4th time visiting Sunset Pizzeria. We strolled in around 2:30 pm, Pauline was at the register and greeted us with a smile.  I told her I was going to try the gluten free pizza today with Ricotta and Meatball, my favorites.  I was pretty happy to find a place that offers a gluten free crust for a reasonable price. My boyfriend ordered a medium pizza with light sauce, extra cheese, pepperoni and black olives. 

My pizza was 12"" around and with a sprinkle of garlic powder and parm I was chowing down.  I ended up eating most of it and taking the one giant slice home.  That was the best gluten free pizza evah (ever)! The boyfriend was eating his pizza and he turned to me with this huge smirk.  I asked him ""what?"", he said ""this place puts our regular pizza place to shame"".

Ready for the damage? Keeping in mind toppings are 1.25 each, my pizza was $12.49 for a 2 topping gluten free crust, my boyfriend had a 3 topping medium pizza for $14.74, 2 sodas a $1.59 each with free refills. Tax included we spent $32.87 but that's fine because later I won't have any hives from eating pizza!  It was well worth the money and the service.

Then they had the nerve to be rude about it and not even replace it. Don't order from here!

In response to your post which is once again rude. I didn't call to complain that there was no cheese which is actually spelled with two e's by the way. I called to complain because there was lettuce and mayo on it. So you should probably get your facts straight and read the ticket again. And by the way it was most definitely not within 51 minutes as you claim. And your staff just called back to apologize and assumed responsibility so you're just making yourself look even worse. Probably wouldn't have come to this had you not been so rude in the first place. So you should spend less time being rude to customers and more time in the accuracy of your orders and customer service.

And it gets better. The oh so unprofessional owner just called me and said ""I suggest you remove the review from Yelp or else"" and then hung up on me! No wonder why your business is so unprofessional with an owner like that. You just lost a long time customer and hopefully anyone who reads this review will keep looking on Yelp for pizza. This all could've been resolved by being handled appropriately in the first place.

Oh so now you change your comment huh. Too little too late. Once again you're in denial that the hamburger was correct. READ THE TICKET. There was not supposed to be any mayo or lettuce which there was. Now you're lying about your service and your threatening calls. Well I have proof of both.

The garlic knots on the other hand were pretty damn tasty, but as I speak I have a frozen pizza in the oven because the gross spinach one was just not doable and the little Hawaiian that is decent is too tiny for two ppl and we've still gotta eat.",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,3,4,3,XzofId3R-AyAwZiq0SfVoQ

He claimed if you call in to order he would've honored it (the price) and I should call eat24 for a refund and to complain. I told him that was his job and his answer was ""maybe if customers call they'll listen.""  

I advised him I work In The executive suites behind his shop (same parking lot) and often order $100 worth of food at time when I teach classes and workshops, and he could at least offer me a $5 credit for next time. 

He refused and I advised I'll no longer do business with him and I'd be posting to yelp.

Well, the experience was very underwhelming. We got wings and fries, and upgraded them to greek fries. We got a pizza with a bunch of toppings, though I don't remember exactly what it was.

When we got there it was dead empty, which I thought wasn't a great sign since it was around dinner time. We got the food, struggled a bit with redeeming the Yelp deal, and went home.

For some reason, whoever made the wings and fries decided to throw them both together in a closed styrofoam to go box. Even though it was 5 minutes back to our apartment, by the time we got there the fries were the mushiest thing I've ever experienced. Also the ""greek"" aspect was almost non existent. The wings were also mushy and not very flavorful.

At this point I was disappointed, but I figured whatever, it's take out fries, hopefully the pizza is good. Well, it was alright. It's hard for me to not feel like pizza is very tasty. I mean, it's bread, cheese, garlic, sauce, how bad could it get? This wasn't ""bad"" but it also wasn't good. I felt very meh about it, which is unusual for me and pizza.

So.... Ordered a pizza online through Yelp at 6:50 on a Monday night. Email comes through, says it should take 45-60 minutes (which is cited on their website). Okay, seems a long time for a pizza, but it's delivery, whatever. 

Email from the third party eat24 comes through with the confirmation, says confirmed order time is 90 minutes.... Ok whatever. 

I should note, the pizza place is .8 miles from my location..... Yes, less than a mile. 

90 minutes comes, I use the online app to message eat24 who follows up on my order... They say driver should be here 10-15 minutes. 

15 minutes goes by, I message again. They said they would follow up to find out where in the world our order is. As she's following up, there is a knock on the door (ten minutes shy of two hours for a pizza less than a mile away). 

Pizza was completely cold, we had to microwave it. All the delivery person had to say was ""sodas free"". We pointed out it took nearly two hours, nothing was said by him and he left. 

I contacted eat24 again (btw eat 24 is amazing) I told them what happened and asked them to please reverse the tip I had paid for in advance online. (I usually am a pretty generous tipper, but this was simply the worst service I've had in a long time)

Eat24 stated they'd have an account manager follow up with the location to vastly improve their service.

Cute little place, very clean, good value, great service, enormous menu, and is now our favorite pizza place here in Vegas. The service was very welcoming and warm. We had a supreme pizza and homemade lasagna. The crust was amazing. Taste very fresh which makes the pizza delicious. Lasagna was excellent. Taste just like mom use to make. Possibly even better honestly! They make their own ranch dressing which was amazing, and tasted excellent on our supreme pizza and salad that came with the lasagna. Definitely a great little place to sit back and enjoy some comfort food.",MDCpI2VO0434zSzGBTb5AA,3,0,5,rNdrZ1jPo1LBF_WgP0UTkQ

Worth every penny. I'm always impressed with the portion of fries. The pizza itself is delicious, a little too greasy sometimes, but delicious. Something in the cheese that tears my stomach apart the day after and never fails, but as I said earlier- it's worth it haha.

The completely forgot the Coke and the driver just shrugged her shoulders and left.  Pizza was grease and cold, the sausage looked like it was added afterwards not even attached to the cheese, just really sad.  The second item was a ham and cheese sub with fries.  I got grease, soggy, mushy fries and highly over salted all you could taste was oil and salt.  The ham sandwhich which didn't say on the menu anything about it being heated had melted provolone cheese and extremely salty ham.  All in all not recommended one of my first orders and most definetly my last.  Save your money and order somewhere else, somewhere where they may care if they bring the complete order and food that is good.",BfPKD-3lKqh3PfeZNrVerw,3,1,1,rpeKi1fQk8MTUoEPYJEa2A

5509203,2015-08-21,0,4EfiNcKSsafogIhAjwv0gg,"We were looking for a good pizza/pasta place close to home. On a hot day off, it is nice to be able to go pick up some tasty food and relax in the house. Found this place on yelp, had everything we wanted, and I am so happy to say we weren't disappointed in the slightest! 
     We ordered a variety of items--pizza, eggplant parm, and a Italian sausage grinder. Everything was so hot and fresh when I picked it up, with great portions. All of the ingredients were great quality--the cheese on the pizza was yummy, and my husband said his eggplant parm was cooked so perfect, the combo of ingredients melted in his mouth. I could tell they paid attention to the little details, specifically with the little side salads--I've seen some that just throw lettuce and tomato in a container and call it good, but these ones had a nice variety of toppings on them. And everything was packed up with care. My only regret is I didn't get the garlic knots, but I know we will be trying them again. I think we found our new home base for pizza!",JzWi9-DgRitg6hopsEK4yQ,1,0,5,zAtQbpt2sTZno9E8_TDf5w

A place that will mess our order up and not care or the Manager is not here and who ever is in control can not make any decisions or call on Monday when the Mgr. Is working. 
Rustica has excellent fresh food. Customer service is important to them.
We always do delivery. One time we ordered the wings {which is awesome} they forgot the Blue Cheese and the owner came out to bring it. What service that was. This is our new place we order at least once a week.  This restaurant Excels with awesome food excellent delivery and great customer service. The food is fresh did I mention that. :}

Pizza was average and I wouldn't even be compelled to write a review, except this establishment should be ashamed of themselves for charging $8.79 for an Italian sub, that had barely 2 slices of meat, and NO cheese! And the meat that was visible was not ""Delicious deli meat,"" per their menu. Yelpers Beware especially when you carry out!!",m5WFgx7D8Z2oHWuNlAmgpQ,1,0,1,yKwVH3UpIVgZ9SB9HcwWTA

We also ordered an appetizer (wings) which were delivered after the pizza. Sort of unusual, but the consensus was that the wings were very good. 
The pizza had lots of toppings and was a generous size. We also shared a dessert, cinnamon bites with raspberry sauce. Loved it! 
Beer & wine are available, and wine for $4 a glass is a typical price. The glass of red I had was pretty decent.
