I've never Ubered Ramen but it came so beautifully presented with the soup separate from the noodles and with a quick mix, it was the perfect temperature. The noodles were perfect, the pork belly very tender, perfect eggs, perfect flavor. If I could do it again, I'd add a spicy component but this was definitely really, really tasty! 

The orange chicken meat was mostly or maybe all white meat and was delicious. The spam fried rice, although simple and plain looking, was still beautifully seasoned.

My entree was the Beef Stew Ramen Noodle Soup. The bowl was chock full of tender chunks  of beef. The broth was refreshing and not spicy. Since I am not a big eater of noodles, fewer would have been fine for me. The finish was the great flavor of Mango Mochi.

Finally I saw the open sign today and we went in for dinner. 

The place is more of a take out, and has few tables, and the place is very clean. 

The waitress says it was opened 12 days go. We had the Chicken wings, and I didn't like them as it was too bland. I gave some suggestions on flavoring them. Tuna sushi was ok. For noodle, I had the Beef Shank. The broth was rich and flavorful. Although it's not the most complex or satisfying broth at I've had, I enjoyed it overall. The real stand-out is the copious amount of tender beef shank about four pieces in an otherwise modestly sized bowl. They weren't extremely flavorful, but they were meaty and can be enjoyed in every bite. The menu was a little pricey imo but was expected.

First the good: friendly staff, great service, clean dining room, great broth, tender meats. Now for the only negative: the actual Ramen/noodles were on the generic side. Their noodles are worlds better than dry, instant Ramen, but only as good as a Hawaiian Saimin from a Takeout Joint not known for Ramen or Saimin. I wish they had better, fresher Noodles, because their broth & the rest of their ingredients are actually very good. I grew up in Hawaii, eating all kinds of Ramen & Saimin & Spent 5 weeks on vacation in Tokyo, Japan..... where everything is so expensive...... Everything that is, except Ramen! I ate so much Ramen in Tokyo & life was so good! Most bowls coming in at around $5 USD. For the record, I had a Takeout bowl of Beef Stew Ramen & maybe, I should have Microwaved the Broth & Noodles to get the whole bowl, steaming HOT. Takeout is never as good as Eat In. Next time I have to try their Miso Ramen. I normally make my own, using the Refrigerated Miso Ramen packs I get from the 99 Ranch Store in Chinatown & adding extra Miso Paste..... a Takeout box of Char Siu, that I slice thin & layer on top of the soup, makes it a real meal.

I also ordered the House Fried Rice and it had no flavor, two of their Special Rolls both were flavorless and mushy. I threw away all of the food it was just tastless. I really push for people to support local businesses I thought well maybe they were having a bad day all of the reviews were great and maybe it was just me. So I waited another month and tried again same exact order and it tasted the same. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I still believe you should support local businesses just mybe not this one.

**Ok so to answer the businesses questions I got take out the first time and ate in the second time thinking that maybe I did not get it home in time. I'm not sure what cost has to do with anything. In MY OPINION I did not like your food. I don't want my money back I pay with cash btw, I got the food and I ate some of it, It was my choice to go back and try again. Good luck with your business and enjoy all of your positive reviews",p3R1YqeQmGSud-Y8AGqEtg,0,0,2,oxDWQuVASeOB_Izb9XmN1w

5554997,2018-01-28,0,odQGs2Rv0nC0fHh4Gfp2iA,"I had the house ramen today (never been here begore) and overall it was very good.

The good:
- broth was super flavorful and the noodles soaked it in perfectly.
- the pork chasu was flavorful and nice and fatty
- the veggies were evenly balanced and very tasty
- the lady who seated me and took my order was the friendliest person I've ever met in my life. I asked a question and she offered me the translations and some history behind the dish. Was super cool!
- bamboo shoots had a nice crunch to them and went well with the dish
- I personally don't like hard boiled eggs but this one was super yummy

The not-so-good:
- the shrimp was too chewy and had little to no flavor

Overall:
Very good and I will definitely be back. I just will ask for no shrimp.",xRns7Vai-J7C6dqJDwAkaA,1,1,5,gBGZlFER8LBQlzrcz3wQ3A

It's 3 minutes from home so I was excited to see a 'Ramen Noodle' sign pop up a couple months ago. I didn't have very high expectations to begin with because any reputable ramen chef wouldn't dare call their restaurant 'Ramen Noodle' but I was hoping it'd be somewhat decent. 

It was pretty bad. We had the beef stew ramen & house ramen. The beef stew broth was a bowl of oil and the house ramen had shrimp in it that didn't taste fresh at all. This place is the China A Go Go of ramen.",8_EW7dMRrRYncAshfq-phg,2,0,2,qAtQQ7VZK6fJ3D8MenpAaw

Atmosphere is casual and welcoming.   Restaurant is very clean and modern.  Small and family owned, we had wonderful service.   

As for the food, we did both ramen and sushi.   The ramen was delicious and very flavorful.   Beef stew is a clear recommendation.   So good ramen was an expectation, given the name of the restaurant.  But the real surprise, was the sushi.   Really good sushi!  Very fresh with great rice.

We had the beef stew and house special ramen noodles. Both were fantastic flavors, meat fell apart noodle were cooked just right. We also ordered the spam fried rice  this was very yummy and will order again. The spam brought the saltiness that you would have added with soy sauce - which we didn't add.  Great tasting rice dish. 
We also tried the pepper and salt chicken wings. Dang they were fantastic. Tasting the pepper and salt - really the flavor was excellent.  
Service was prompt and friendly. Very inviting environment. 
Our only complaint was that the appetizer was brought out last. I would have liked to have the wings and rice then main course. But we ate them All. 
50% off second item made the cost even better. 
Very enjoyable meal in a very friendly restaurant.  See you soon!",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,4,GPiMrkTkOsjOhjUdBtSe6Q
