The vegetable egg rolls were fresh and delicious.

The shrimp fried rice (with spicy level 3) was fantastic. I'd come here again for this dish. I could handle the spicyness, but my boss and coworker were sweating. I'd recommend spicy level 2 as bearable for people who aren't accustomed to spicy food.

This mother-daughter team work like crazy!  To my knowledge it's just the two of them both front and back of house.  They are working non-stop, but still take the time to be kind, funny and thoughtful.  

The prices are also incredibly reasonable. A sit down lunch for two runs about $15, pretty amazing.

They were quite busy and only one person taking orders and serving and cleaning up. So the meal took us over an hour. But the food and prices were OK. We probably won't go back.,6QByjUgecHo5Uja2-1QiCg,0,1,3,qNCF4zDgEJi7xKA0s_l7YQ
417953,2012-07-09,0,6hsXF2bRmrstSmwuHwI-kw,"Yay! I'm a fan.

Don't let my near average rating fool you; it is entirely subjective towards my experiences.  By Las Vegas standards, this is an absolutely outstanding restaurant.  Unfortunately, that puts a fairly dismal outlook on this city.  So, if you're wondering where you were supposed to be getting (Thai) food this entire time, Siam Garden is a good start.

This establishment is located in the same strip-mall as another godsend (USS Fish N Chips).  That means it's in the same shady neighborhood, but like most adventures, some risk is required.  I never thought it was going to be so difficult to find gems like these.  I'd be all for chain-restaurants if they could match the quality AND quantity of Mom & Pop places like these.  A couple do... most don't.  What's so desirable about such places?  It's that feeling that you've been invited into someone's home, and that family is taking personal pride into cooking for you.  Judging by the sincere courteousness of the waitress, and the execution of entrees, Siam Garden definitely falls into that category.

I ordered a chicken red curry; my friend ordered the Pad Thai; and we both had Thai Iced Teas.  We are no strangers to Thai, and these dishes are the standard that any respectable Thai restaurant should pass.  I wouldn't say we were amazed or notably impressed, but we pleasantly surprised mostly in part to our lack of luck elsewhere.  When asked, my friend approved of the Pad Thai.  I've become used to seeing more broth than ingredients, so I was quite happy to have my curry chalk full of fresh ones.  I would have liked to have seen more basil and meat, but what was there was all white meat.  I have yet to see a Thai place screw up sticky rice, and this place was no different.  As for the Thai Iced Teas... forget about it.  They are always worth ordering.

Their spiciness level is also quite curious.  There is the normal 1-5 (mild, medium, hot, thai hot), but then there's the super 6-15.  I can't image the gastronomical napalm they must be wielding.  Since I was already getting a hot (temperature-wise) dish, I opted for a 2, and it verged on perfect -- should have gotten then 3.  My friend did get the 3, and he was quite content.

There's a military discount that was advertised yet we didn't even ask about -- it just showed up on the bill.  Our food arrived fairly quickly, and I'll make another plug for the wonderful customer service by the waitress.  I'm happy places like this can still exist in a city like Las Vegas, and they very much deserve our support.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,1,1,4,yJG3GElzjIPaAj3Y_1yxPg
483094,2015-02-20,0,6hsXF2bRmrstSmwuHwI-kw,"Outstanding food at very reasonable prices. Our only complaint would be that they seem to be suffering a bit from their success. It's a small place, by my count only nine tables, and when they are in the middle of the lunch time rush, every table is full with a few people waiting. There was only one waitress and she was doing her best, but she was understandably over extended.

The down side is that it's clearly family owned. I came by one day for lunch, and there was a sign stating that the restaurant was closed so they could attend their family reunion. This place is also very small, and has one person who serves as the waitress, host, and cashier. She is very nice, but Siam gets busy.

They have different levels of spicy you can get, the main selection being between 1-5, but you can go way past that if you want.  I usually get a 2 or 3 and that's spicy enough for me.  Yesterday I tried the garlic vegetables over steamed white rice, and it was really good, and worked as my lunch and dinner.  I got it vegan style with no oyster sauce.

For the main course, He ordered the sweet and sour chicken and i ordered the fried tilapia - both came with steamed rice. We didn't realize that servings are pretty huge, so you better come here hungry. Flavors were outstanding. You can choose your level of spice. I choose level 5 and husband chose level 3. Be very careful about your spice levels since they use Thai chili, and for people who never had Thai chili- it is pretty spicy!! You would ask for extra rice to enjoy your meal. 
For desert we tried the coconut ice cream and roti with mango. Both were delightful. Coconut ice cream was on point. First time trying roti and i was hooked. It's like a Thai version of crepe.

Here goes...the best thai food is usually found in small, frugally decorated ""hole in the wall"" restaurants that have grandma-type women cooking in the back.  How do I know this?  Did I mention I eat A LOT of thai food?  Oh and my husband is Thai.  Unfortunately for me, he can't cook.  But now I'm digressing.  moving on...

Siam Garden fulfills this little-known secret and then some.  Not only was the food authentic and delicious, but it was the great service of Belle (the owners' daughter who is the sole waitress) that helped propel my rating to 5 stars.  She was always smiling and very courteous.  Like I said earlier, I have been to many thai restaurants and although the thai culture is known for being kind and always smiling, I don't usually see it in thai restaurant staff.  Go figure!  

The way Belle interacted with us and her demeanor just puts you in a good mood.  Never mind that the restaurant lacked a/c and the only thing keeping us cool were a few fans.  Hubby joked that it felt like we were actually eating in Thailand...the food was super spicy (even though we only ordered level 2 out of a possible 15(!!!)... and we were sweatin' like pigs.  Thankfully we had ordered thai ice tea and it came in ginormous glasses with big pieces of ice--refreshing!  That helped the heat a lil...  The entire dinner experience just felt very nostalgic for us.  

We will be leaving Las Vegas tomorrow so I'm sad we didn't go here earlier.  But we will definitely be back.  If only they can move to the OC....",kTA-f2zhfEFJOBpgYw4DOg,1,2,5,5pVriKZMRm9Z_2JxLPxIlg

Service is excellent, although there is only one waitress. Lunch gets very busy as many people on base like to dine here. Try and avoid 12-2pm is you can.

The larb was served with lettuce, which was different. I prefer cabbage with larb, yet the larb itself was good enough. The pad Thai was freshly prepared with spices being clearly distinguishable. The chicken panang curry was perfect. The second visit, just this afternoon, was worth the 15-20 min drive from home in this unbearable heat. My hubby and I got the beef noodle soup at a level 1 spice, he got the bucket panang curry at a level 2 spice and fried calamari for an app. My husband describes the broth as the best Thai soup he's had in the states... even with that level 1 spice, it was deff spicy! There is not 1 criticism I can link to my soup, it was amazing. We spoke about how it'll be our go to spot for Thai noodle soup come winter time. The calamari was legit and not excessively breaded. This ain't your typical freezer calamari, it was fresh! The chicken panang curry, on this visit lacked a significant depth in the coconut milk used. Oh yah, we also got dessert... an order of banana roti and an order of mango roti. DO IT, you won't be disappointed! Can't beat the hospitable waitress, either!

The atmosphere is VERY humble. You will likely have a bit of a wait as this place is VERY popular with the folks at Nellis AFB. If you are not in a hurry, you will be most impressed.

2594074,2010-06-20,2,6hsXF2bRmrstSmwuHwI-kw,"This place has been around a long time, and has gone through several owners and changes.  Currently, the food is at its best right now.  I consider it to be 'average, but authentic Bangkok style Thai food.'  Some of the recipes are outstanding, others are not so much.  The waitress is very friendly.  In fact, she took our picture and put it up on the wall with a myriad of other customer pictures.  Since I work very close to this restaurant, I have returned for quick, well priced meals during my lunch hour with coworkers.  

One of the traditional Thai dishes that Siam Garden does extremely well compared to other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas is their Tom Kha Kai.  This is a coconut based soup with mushrooms, chicken, lime juice, and galanga root.  Watch out for the galanga root if you are not used to it.  The broth is much creamier than most places, and with a little extra lime juice on the side it can make you pucker!  I was very impressed with this dish at Siam Garden.

I have had quite a few dishes here.  The curry is ok, but nothing to rave about.  The Rad Na is average, and I won't be ordering it again.  The fried rice is ok, but sometimes a bit too greasy for Thai fried rice.  My favorite dish here is the pad see ew.  The noodles in this dish, and the flavors of the sauce make it pretty good, along with fresh Chinese broccoli.  

One thing that they don't do well here is pork.  The pork tends to be very dry and chewy.  I always order chicken here over the pork.

Another annoying thing about this place is how they interpret the ""spice level"".  I like spicy Thai food, but there is no sense in ordering anything above a ""mild"" because every dish seems to be prepared with a ""very hot"" rating.  And to think that their sign says that you can try their food with even hotter levels. One thing is for sure, for better or for worse this is the hottest Thai restaurant I have ever been to.

If you live or work in the area, give this place a try.  I wouldn't drive more than 10 minutes to get there, but considering the lack of places to eat in this neighborhood, it is pretty decent authentic Thai food.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,1,3,g5YInJ1LQm7Ba5RxfS0UmA

The girl working was running around frantically because she had too many duties. She was the waitress, hostess, food runner, and buser. She needs some help during the lunch rush. 

I ordered the yellow curry which is usually a safe bet at any Thai restaurant. It came out piping out. Not very pleasant when you can't even enjoy your food because it's too hot to eat. The curry tasted pretty average, chicken was gummy which is pretty standard for a hole in the whole Thai restaurant, vegetables tasted fresh. One thing I did appreciate was the spice level scale being accurate. I ordered the level 2 which I was told was medium spice level.

Siam Garden is a logistical nightmare. A front of house that is only about 400 square feet coupled with far too many 4- topper tables seating parties of two translates into a very inefficient setup. Plus, there's only one employee in the front of house so she's serving as hostess, waitress, and cashier at the same time. 

I arrived on a Tuesday for lunch at 11:50am. I was meeting two friends over our lunch hour. After a 20 minute wait, we were seated. Our drinks came within another 10 minutes and we placed our orders. And then we waited. At 12:45, with still no food, my friends asked to change their orders to ""to go.""  At 12:55, they had to leave without food. The food came out at 1:05pm, 75 minutes after arrival. I paid for all the food and left the restaurant at 1:15pm to deliver the food to my friends' places of employment, a total of 85 minutes from the time I arrived. From the looks of the crowd, this was average for that lunch service. There were a lot of frustrated people. 

Why 2-stars?  Mainly because Siam Garden's hours are really lunch-only. If you are a lunch-only restaurant and it takes someone 80 minutes to get in and out, that's not impressive. Is the food good?  Yes, undoubtedly, but it makes little difference if the dining experience takes an hour and a half when you have only (ahem) a lunch hour.",F1fvzDj245JzNttdK0g9Lw,2,0,2,4KZQxmHXnWjIqR5NNVk_hw

I guess nobody can duclicate their famous BBQ. This was just okay and fortunately we ordered other things like Pad Thai and chicken satay. Pad Thai was really good, one of the better ones I've tried. I was at first surprised to see the color of the noodles to be color-less. That was weird for me because they usually had a orange/redish color, but our asian friend immediately corrected me and said they don't use food coloring- good to know! Other than the color issue it was really tasty. The chicken satay was good too and came with a peanut sauce. The service was standard and probably a step up from most Asian restaurants.

5087863,2009-02-26,9,6hsXF2bRmrstSmwuHwI-kw,"Siam Garden is in a slightly sketchy area. How do I know this? Because the vagrant that wandered into the path of a dump truck bringing it to a screeching halt while I was waiting to turn told me through the acrid smoky cloud rolling off the tires of the truck. Because the sign on the C-store on the corner proclaimed it with it's broken marquee reading something like ""___OP AND B___"" Because the security gated doorways and litter strewn lot next door quietly whispered ""sketchy"" in my ear as I pulled in the lot. 

I decided to give them a shot. I was hopeful because when I called to verify the location (and make sure they were still in business) the woman who answered the phone did not speak English. 

There is essentially no ambiance here. It moved to Henderson several years ago. I was the only customer. Service was fast. It was almost like they were waiting for me. Or someone like me. 

I started with Thai tea which was sufficiently tasty. The menu is pretty simple with mostly Thai dishes and a smattering of popular ""Americanized"" Chinese dishes like orange chicken. 

I ordered chicken red curry, hot. I have not been satisfied with the heat of the curries I have had lately so I stepped up to hot. The dish came up quickly. The curry sauce had a coconut milk base but was more watery and less sweet than many I have had. Not a bad thing. It had an atypical assortment of veggies: okra, some sort of small green squash, red pepper, green pepper and some vegetable that I asked them to identify but have forgotten the name of already. And bay leaves. The chicken was white meat, plentiful and tender. Get an additional order of rice and this dish is enough for 2 people. For $6.99. In fact my total including the tea was about $9.25.

A decent and serviceable hole in the wall Thai place.

5300149,2011-12-13,1,6hsXF2bRmrstSmwuHwI-kw,"So many things this restaurant has could mean it's a bad place, yet for Siam Garden they all work for it.
  Shady part of town, tiny dining area, homey fixtures, cheezy animated pictures and one of those little fake waterfall setups.  That was my impression when I came here for the first time, then I started to notice a few things.  Like how clean it always is, how friendly and attentive the staff is, the pictures of all the smiling customers, and of course the food.  
 I've tried a pretty wide selection of their menu, soups, noodles, stir fry, and appetizers. Everything has been top rate, one of our favorites is the Thai beef jerky and sticky rice.  Their lunch specials are good and cheep, you always get plenty of food.  If you're in the military they have a discount too.

5390427,2012-11-28,2,6hsXF2bRmrstSmwuHwI-kw,"Had to work the Cheyenne Campus of CSN a few weeks ago, and I think as I've stated before I absolutely hate the dining options in that area.  Decided to give this place a go since Thai food literally always sounds good to me, and I went with the Mint Chicken lunch special because it was the closest to my usual Spicy Basil chicken that I order at all Thai joints.  

First note:  DO NOT USE APPLE MAPS TO GET DIRECTIONS TO THIS PLACE.  I'm batting about 60% success with their new maps as of 11/27/12, so I should have known better, but it had me circling around the Fresh and Easy parking lot which was about a quarter mile up the street (it had me turn right and not a left on LV Blvd from Cheyenne).  So yeah I started wondering if it was somehow connected to Fresh and Easy because a) I'm an idiot and b) Siri kept telling me I'd arrived.  Thanks Siri!   Anyway, I called the restaurant and they told me how to get there with what sounded like a smile on the other end of the phone.

When I arrived first thing I noticed was it was packed.   Literally 90% of the tables were full, and people seemed to be enjoying their meals.  It did make it a little uncomfortable to have to stand and wait with a few others who had takeout orders as well.  I dont know about them, but I felt like I was interfering with all the seated patrons' meals.  Besides that service was friendly and I was on my way quickly.  

Getting back to my office I opened it up and was generally pleased with what I saw.  Unfortunately they don't have brown rice as an option which I should be used to by now but truth be told it still disappoints each and every time it happens.  I thought they nailed my spice level of 4 out of 5.  It had just enough kick but not so much that it caused an internal organ riot within.  Everything tasted okay, but my biggest issue was the texture and consistency of the chicken.  There's three types of chicken you can get when you order this sort of dish from a thai restaurant (some offer a choice, but I never ask for one way or another):  finely ground (a la Archis and Pin Kaow standard), finely sliced (a la Weera or Prommares), or the third kind which is some sort of amalgam of both of those versions.   I vastly prefer one or the other but not the mixed kind, which is what I got here.  There's something about the texture of it all when the chicken pieces seem halfway ground up or poorly chopped up.   Thankfully there wasn't a lot of fat involved which I've seen occur with this method, but in the end it still was pretty middle of the road for how I've experienced this dish.

I would certainly give this place another shot or two if I worked or lived close by, but given how few and far between I'm on that side of town, we are probably never ever getting back together.  Like ever.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,1,3,oTYw5ENJAbF-Z33Z3-lNgw

My favorite dish is their green curry Thai fried rice with chicken, level 15. This restaurant knows how to add some heat to the food without ruining the amazing flavor I've come to love.

Working on base and planning ahead allows my wife and I, or office, to order our meals for pick up and complete our weekly tradition. In the three years of ordering from Siam Garden we have never had a mistake with our orders or any complaints. 

So why 4/5 stars? One reason and one reason only, their ability to match their supply and demand is bad. This place is so good folks will wait over an hour to eat here, however, coming here for a sit down lunch is almost impossible due to this. In my five attempts to sit and eat we were successful twice. We had to cancel or get our already ordered meal to go. I recommend these folks moving to a larger location and hiring some more folks. The, ""if you build it, they will come"" adage strongly applies to this awesome crew.

It is a little hole in the wall place with hardly any ""ambience"", but I mean really, it's a hole in the wall Thai place. I'm there for the food, not the decoration. I've had the Pad Thai, Pad Woon Sen, Tom Yum soup, and house salad...and all were very tasty. The Pad Woon Sen is a personal favorite, with clear rice noodles, egg, thick cut cucumbers and tomatoes. The veggies add a nice cooling aspect to the dish when you order it 'hot'. The Tom Yum soup was also very tasty, fragrant of lemongrass and just enough spice to counteract the sour. The Pad Thai is not the BEST I've ever had, but it was still tasty and I would probably order it again. The salad was like any other regular salad, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion...but also pineapple and a TASTY dressing. The dressing was slightly sweet and creamy. I almost wish they would bottle and sell it!

Oh, you also usually get a spring roll with your meal. It is fantastic. The skin is fried to a crispy brown perfection. It retained a bit of the oil in the wrapper, but it's not too greasy like most fried foods and it didn't leach onto the veggies inside.

The waitress (same one every time I've been - she may be the only one they have) is always very polite and extremely nice. Both times I went in and ordered take-out she always offered a glass of water while I waited for my food.
