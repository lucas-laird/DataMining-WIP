You may step into the food court and Pan Asian Express may catch your eye. ""Wow, I could really go for some Chinese food,"" you think to yourself. The name might even remind you of something similar, say...Panda Express?

Well, if you've gotten that far, then S-T-O-P. Take a step back. And go to McDonald's instead.

This establishment is NOT worth your time, stomach space, nor money. You are paying for tiny portions of poor quality food. And while I wouldn't expect food court quality to be the greatest nor Vegas prices to be the cheapest.. this was just disappointing on a whole new level.

A single entree, single side bowl was nearly $10 and was TINY - maybe barely enough for a child. I got my bowl with mixed vegetables and broccoli and beef, and while it was edible, it was not satisfying in the least.

Service was good. But our Beef and Broccoli  and Orange Chicken was like eating balls of deep fried paste dipped in the most bland sauce you can find. I tried to force it down because I hadn't eaten in a while but it was impossible. $10  2 item combo in the garbage.

5514962,2017-12-27,10,mGCOI83lIiDfc4cEOtmZlQ,"Considering how much time I was set to spend here for my conference, it was a given that I'd end up trying a few of the eateries/restaurants MGM Grand has to offer.  However, I can't say I figured that would include two of their food courts offerings (review for Nathan's to come).  I have no one to blame but myself though - what was I thinking, bracketing my lunch break with sessions?  Hard to wander off when there's not much time to go very far...ugh.

Located inside MGM Grand's food court, Pan Asian Express is nothing special, to be entirely honest.  Essentially a nicer looking Panda Express, but more generic and without as wide of a variety to choose from.  That being said, what they do have (including Orange Chicken!) doesn't look too shabby.  What's more, the prices aren't egregious, which is nice since I didn't have a ton of alternatives...

After choosing the Vegetable Chow Mein as the ""base"" for my TWO ITEM COMBO (they also have plain rice, as well as fried rice), I opted to go with their Ginger Chicken with Vegetables and their Orange Chicken (of course, I had to!) over options like Vegetable Stir Fry, Chicken & Mushrooms, Sweet & Sour Pork, Egg Rolls, and Crab Rangoon.

All in all, while the food clearly didn't impress, it actually wasn't as bad as I had feared (which isn't saying much).  On the one hand, the Orange Chicken was meaty with a nice, citric flavor and the Ginger Chicken was a fried (though repetitive) surprise.  Yet, there were more minuses than pluses - the chow mein was gummy and bland, the Orange Chicken's batter was thick and soggy, and the Ginger Chicken was a bit salty.

Considering it's comparably priced to a regular mall food court (in SF, anyways), Pan Asian Express isn't awful if you want to save a few bucks without leaving the hotel.  However, I'd rather use the $16 I paid for my meal ($10.98) and a bottle of water ($3.48) on something more unique or Shake Shack across the street.  Unless you're virtually tethered to the conference center like how I was...ugh.

TWO AND A HALF STARS, but rounded down.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,9,9,2,ZDjRrbiB-dG6scmBuK4kEA
