I found one of the best ways to wait on a flat tire.  It's a small bakery/deli/market specializing in Armenian food.  Simple but delicious.  The market is pretty cool with some Southern European specialties.  As we left, the baker gave us some Armenian bread...and that's why I'm writing this review.  It was out of this world.  I consider myself lucky for stumbling into this place.  Now I'm a regular.",jyPQQKFW657j985IYybuxQ,0,1,5,0fylAOZJeCSK8qTPR_ne9A

I ordered take out while visiting with friends and it was a huge disappointment. The spicy cheese burekka was very good. The lamahjoon was excellent.

 The pizza was pretty bland and the crust fair at best, but this item was ordered by my friend and I did not expect this restaurant to excel in a cuisine that is not within their area of expertise. Unfortunately, we ordered piroshikis in a variety of flavors. They were ALL RANCID, not just light rancid, but very, very rancid.  I suspect the oil they used had been recycled too many times.  It was inedible. I called the restaurant to let them know.  The gentleman on the phone thanked me for the information but did not offer an apology nor suggested a refund or replacement for those items.",-vGj3jPzz65jRIVqjU4mCQ,0,1,3,DvaVfQ9C00cSczlNA4AIAA

3332706,2018-03-06,0,CxzUdREgfS4ymtXFSREf8Q,"This review is for 3.5 stars. 

Quantity and variety of the entree is very nice. I order delivery and my meal was door to door and fresh in an hour. My chicken and beef kabob came with about 3 large chunks of perfectly grilled, thick meat. The chicken and beef were about the same in terms of taste, both with some Mediterranean spices to give it some flavor. The entree had some runny hummus, tasty tabouleh, a thin, hard pita, and some fine rice. I was disappointed in the pita as I'm typically a fan of the fluffy variety, same with the hummus as I like it chunkier - but I guess this is TK's style. In all the meal was about $13. I also order d a Greek salad for $8 which was humongous and had fresh ingredients, but it seemed lazy (large chunks of tomato, not a lot of feta. But again, this was all delivery so presentation isn't going to match a sit down atmosphere. T.K. in total was good and a nice option to go or delivery, but I wouldn't say it's the one and only stop for good Mediterranean in Vegas.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,2,1,3,e7hd3RdZnMYuBuhBHZ_dzA

4368688,2017-12-27,1,CxzUdREgfS4ymtXFSREf8Q,"Ordered four combo plates and a Greek salad.  All came with rice, hummus, tabbouleh and nan.

1st combo was chicken Lula and beef kabob, which was ok.  The beef tasted flavorless for a kabob, but the chix Lula made up for the flavor.

2nd combo was beef kabobs, as mentioned flavorless, so big disappointment and no sauce.

3rd and 4th combo was a mixture of chicken/beef kabobs and chicken/beef Lulas, again the kabobs kept coming up short with the flavors. 

Greek salad was nicely portioned. 

As for the meats I'll come back for the lulas, but not the kabobs.  I guess you can use the hummus for extra flavor since I didn't get any taziki sauce in my combo.",u2jYb3GGDT2LuQt08xA6TQ,6,2,3,PtPKpAsdYtv1pKGMlWnOfQ

Everything is delivered on disposable plates, plastic flatware and styrofoam containers but none of that matters.  The food is delicious and the portion sizes are perfect.  While you eat, the pastries in the cases start calling to you........ they have a wide array of Armenian pastries as well as some of your favorite classics.

* Chicken soup. Very tasty, infused with thin-sliced carrots and some other sources of flavors. And a good deal at $6 (it can be a meal in and of itself).

* Beef kabobs. A little tough for my taste, though I did like the flavor. And I liked the bread and hummus that came with the dish.

* Chicken kabob and luna. Better, imo, than the beef kabobs. I'd order it again.

The kabobs and lunas are not cheap, but unlike certain other restaurants of the cuisine, I have confidence that they are using better-quality ingredients, not loaded with salt and other preservatives.

They have a number of other dishes that I would like to try, too, and I look forward to getting more food from them.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,1,4,xsDBgClWoD6Z1bAWUzAB0A
