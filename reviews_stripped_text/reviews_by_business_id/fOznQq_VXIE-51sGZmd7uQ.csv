From the goat cheese pizza to the duck tacos to the chili to the hummus and pita. We've been making 3, 4, 5am stops here for years and the place has yet to disappoint!!",C8irw69IcDsvgQ7vCOW9rA,1,2,5,CYCzp9igt5npz-jPK4ddZA

Duck tacos, soup, chili, and the add ins weekly that make us expand our love for this place is great and notable.  

Keep up the good work and reputation with your regulars!",1kofwLQWuMvWv5G5FzJB8g,0,0,5,4P04NdHc-Ir4dvHxrmoJRQ

I just wish that the other bartenders where as compassionate as she is she enjoys her job and does it very well even after her horrific experience during the shooting she is still ready to work and very friendly I wish every bartender was as good as her... note to management she saved your business she needs a raise,RZDdZSlP88BS07UcZRz3BQ,0,0,5,QUkwP6Au-9OW8PScgSsSZA
