Went to watch the Super Bowl game and they were great host for a big game.
 We were impressed, and like   the rustic  lodge decor. Newer  and well appointed. 
Plenty of TVs!! 
We sat on a comfy couch in front of multi TV screens.
The service was impeccable with Both Anna and Lexy. Ownership making sure we were going to have fun with several raffles, giveaways, freebies, jello shots.... and a lot of great people to meet and talk with and have fun with.
Drinks were good.  full menu and special game menu. Loved the short ribs on a bed of coleslaw. 
Turned out to be a very Fun and memorable Superbowl experience.
Plus my team won lol.
Next time in Las Vegas, will stop in!

Steward fire him or her please. This bar was sooooo busy u had to fight to get to the bar what happened??? How much money ru you losing now? It's scary to think about it?

Well as much as someone who works 60 hours a week can hang out. Staff are all extremely friendly and do a very good job. I usually only visit between the hours of 6pm to 10pm (on any given night). Tried almost everything on their menu that is served 24hours. I've never had anything bad. It's all been just above average so score. Ambiance is nice and has that ""in the middle of Wyoming feel"" only with tons of TV's that showcases any game and sound to boot.  As much as I want to be selfish and tell people not to go in so I always have a seat when I get there....others should get to know Blair or Anna or any of the wonderful staff that works there.

The service was ok, the food was actually really good, but when I ordered a drink off the little flip book thing on the table, the server and bartender didn't even know what it was.  That to me isn't very professional to not know drinks that you sell.  We did like the food and atmosphere though so we decided to go back this past Sunday night.  We wanted to shoot some pool and have some happy hour drinks.  We arrived around 12:15am (happy hour is 12am until 2am) and shot 3 games of pool.  I asked the bartender, his name was Aaron, if they had the tequila flight on special (huge sign in front of their bathroom) he acted as if he didn't know what it was.  He asked someone else and they said only during football.  I said ok then we'll do 2 well vodka tonics.  He said ok, made the drinks.  We then proceeded to order 3 each (kind of weak) and my bill was $36.  I was like what?  How are well drinks $6 during happy hour?  PT's pub it's $3!! So my husband went back in, because their premium drinks (bombay, tanquerey, ketel one) were $5 each.  The bartender literally told my husband, ""I don't know why that is, it makes no sense why well drinks are more"".  Um ok.  Why didn't you tell us that when we ordered them?  It's like do you want Aristocrat for $6 or Grey Goose for $5?  I mean it's a no brainer!! Of course we wanted WAY better liquor for a total of $6 less! It was so upsetting how the bartender failed to even tell us this then when we brought it to his attention he told us even he thought it was stupid, and didn't even offer a discount!! They will NEVER get our business again. Beware of this place, ask how much everything is before you order it!!",8t0hmAWTCobt8jIbRAWsyQ,0,0,1,4iJ0Wx2S9LPcccaAKk_ZpQ

The bar itself isn't much to brag about. If it wasn't for the service of these two young ladies, I'd probably never go back. 4 old guys sitting at machines. Not much excitement.
The Nachos were very good, but may want to ask them to go easy on the Jalapeños.
The grilled cheese was great, but they don't have many soup options. So, I went with French Fries. Can't really mess up on French Fries

All of these were on the appetizer menu, so our total bill was under $20! 

The food was good- although the hot-tiaki wings tasted like regular buffalo wings (no terryiaki flavor). Everything came out piping hot, and the portions were really big for appetizers. I had to box up some things to take home.

Went here with a couple friends, we decided to hit up this place. Parking was in a shady area (or at least one of my friends thought so). It's next door to some mexi food place and a work out center for women only. 

Walked inside, OMG, am I in the mountains...in a cabin? Nope, it's the Lodge. Literally, the Lodge. Inside the decor was like being inside a lodge. There's a mounted buffalo's head (maybe it was a beefalo), a fireplace and wooden interiors.

We only ordered beers. Yup, just beers. We wanted to try out the food but that's on our to do list for our next trip here. Got New Castle and Blue Moon. I tasted the was it's supposed to taste.

We were the only customers in the restaurant and were greeted promptly by our server.  The menu pricing is pretty standard for bar food...maybe a little pricier.  We came in at $26 for 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks.  I had high hopes when I ordered the Roast Beef and Cheddar sandwich with fries.  My fiance went with the NY Steak sandwich.  He ordered it medium rare and it in fact came out medium rare, which was definitely a plus!  Most places will overcook a steak when it is ordered this way.  Although he devoured the sandwich, he did note that the steak was very bland and tasted as though there was no seasoning on it.  My sandwich was okay in taste... I assumed that the roast beef would be fresh, but was greatly disappointed when I looked at my sandwich and noticed the rainbow fish scale sheen on the outside of the meat (the preservative used on roast beef).  For some reason, this sight has always made my stomach turn ever since I was little and I only ate about a quarter of the sandwich and finished up my fries (which were quite tasty).  

I'm not sure if this restaurant will be one of my top picks in the future for a quick meal, but the service is definitely on par and the ambiance really makes you feel like you're holed up in a lodge on a winter evening (with gambling and basketball on TV- of course).",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,0,0,3,Y_4gIQzKjdAzWzIfw5MaFA

Came in with my family to watch the Warriors game, we sat in a corner part of the room and were told by the waitress who sat us that the bartender would be over momentarily to change the channel. 15+ minutes later, during which the bartender had spent tons of time gossiping and had thrown a visible tantrum over my uncle ordering a beer they happened to run out of, the bartender told my husband when he came to politely remind her of our request to ""be quiet"", ""I'm only one person, leave me alone"", and then told us she couldn't get the game up on the larger screen in the section we had sat on and we'd ""just have to deal with it""... without even trying.  She must have been too stupid to figure it out, because she was far from being ""hot"" enough to get away with that kind of attitude on a regular basis. We had been planning to drink and eat dinner here throughout the game, but quickly changed our mind and went to Hokaido down the street. 
To the bartender in question: I am a manager who oversees a large customer service team, and if anyone on my team treated any client the way you treated us you would be fired on the spot. Your poor attitude and work ethic cheated you out of what would have been a large bill for your location and a comparable tip. I also will be advising my company's event planning committee to eliminate your location as an option for hosting our holiday party - congrats on losing all that money

It looks like one of those log hunting lodges .....
with the huge fireplace found in all the cold northern states.

It sits on the far south end of Las Vegas near the end of Russell road or Tropicana. You find it just after crossing over the 215.

""The Tavern at Fort Apache"" sounds like it should be the name of a western movie..... I found it to be a totally enjoyable experience.

It was quiet during the day I went, but I can imagine this huge circular bar with log beams headed up into the sky and a crackling fireplace gets rocking at night.
There is a nice sized wooden floor dining area with comfortable seating around classic wooden tables that is seperate from the main bar and game room. 
Large windows still allow you to check out the main room action.
The dining area is ideal for those that want to enjoy a meal with some conversation before heading back into the rocous game room.

There are many TV's and monitors located throughout the bar and
I was able to check out the sports action while enjoying a tasty margarita ............. 
The lodge looks to have a variety of beer choices for those so inclined.

It does help to know someone to get the preferential treatment,

The Nachos seemed smaller than the last time but it was still tasty with: Jalapeños, Sour Cream, Beef, Cheese and Red / White corn chips.  There may have been more to it but that's what I remember.  

The Hotiyaki Chicken Tenders was served with four pieces of chicken, covered in their Hotiyaki sauce.  It was a mix of Hot Sauce and Teriyak and it wasn't at all hot.  Came with a few sticks of celery, carrots and ranch sauce.

The Egg Rolls come with a dipping sauce and 4 egg rolls cut in half.  I wish I would've taken pictures of the food but we were already tearing into the food.

The service was great, we got refills on our drinks before asking and the waitress checked in at least 5 times us during our visit.

These Girls were rude, no eye contact, never checked on us after she brought us our drinks just plain rude, Not sure if we got this service because we were a young guy & girl couple and not two horny dudes, they just didn't make us feel welcome. regardless we still tipped above 15%, I work in the service industry and am a Hospitality student at Unlv and it just sucks going into local bars that have employees not service oriented, that leaves places with a bad rap, and is just bad for business.

Now the reason I gave 2 stars and not 1... Im giving the extra star to our server who was not either one of the bartenders. Ill give her and the kitchen 5 STARS. She was super sweet and prompt and checked on us unlike the bartenders. My wife got the Ahi Salad and I got the Hotiyaki Wings which both dishes came out awesome. 

I would recommend the dining part of this establishment however I would not recommend the Gaming/Bar side, and thats sad because Vegas needs a better Food and Beverage scene for locals off the strip. this place can do way better on the bar side with a friendlier staff without stuck up attitudes!",owBS5ySvwvM4lXSRQfdRqg,3,0,2,aRic4aL9PemsC1ov7GcaiQ

1. Great food selection at fair prices. They have yummy breakfast served all day, I love the breakast burrito.

2. Friendly and fun staff. Corrine, the bartender, is fantastic. Our drinks are never empty and the waitresses are great about the special requests one of my coworkers sometimes has when it comes to how her food is prepared. 

3. Super loose machines, at least that's what I hear, I don't gamble much... Last time I was there for lunch the coworker sitting next to me was dealt 4 aces, so they seem pretty loose to me! 

The ambiance is also nice, it reminds me of ski resort lodge...  and the music they play during the lunch hour isn't super annoying.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,3,2,3,YJCIfYHy43xFgM7bz8klIQ

Within 30 minutes we were already in for $500.00.  We waited what felt like forever to get our drinks refilled.  We were never given any information of promotions or 4 of a kind drawings etc...  The two female bartenders did not even introduce themselves.  I couldn't get a shot to save my life!  

Bottom line is there was a huge sense of entitlement there and I WILL NEVER BE BACK.  It's unfortunate to have this expereience I myself and my boyfriend have been in the SAME industry for 15 years.

Food: 1 Star at best. I have received salads with rotten vegetables and BLACK avocado on more than one occasion. I personally prefer my avocado to be green or absent if they are unable to serve a somewhat fresh ingredient on one of the few ""healthy"" food choices they have. Maybe I would have a better chance of landing a good meal here if I went for chicken wings or a burger... But in my opinion, if you cant uphold a decent ingredient that you have on your menu STOP SERVING IT. I certainly have decided to stop ordering it and not go back!
Drinks: Cheap/Affordable made by decent bartenders 
Service: Good if you sit at the bar... Not so great if you sit at a table. 

This is a gaming/sports bar type of environment. If I wanted to watch football or a game, this may be worth hitting up just for drinks... But I wouldn't recommend eating here for a fun dinner because the food quality is so low.",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,5,2,1,1zRv3hwrkm6iEynUoUSlZQ

It was quiet on a Wednesday as we were the only ones here for lunch.  The waitress came out and got our beverages going as we checked out the menu.

I went for the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich ""Marinated grilled chicken breast, fresh avocado, swiss cheese, apple wood bacon, red onion, tomato and sprouts.  Served with mayo, on a fresh baked roll."" ($8.95)  My sandwich was surprisingly really good - the chicken was very flavorful and not dry at all.  It was definitely a score with my choice! 

The Husband went for their Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich ""Tender tri-tip, lighted grilled then dipped in our slow cooked rosemary au jus, topped with swiss cheese and stuffed in a toasted hoagie roll."" ($8.95)  Sadly, it was very disappointing for him, lacking flavor and the au jus definitely needed a little something to jazz it up.

All sandwiches and wraps come with your choice of fries, onion rings, cole slaw or side salad.  We both chose the side salad and definitely appreciate that it's a generous side salad, not those things you get from Wendy's! 

Overall, I was really pleased and the Husband was not.  I guess it's a hit or miss here.  They still accept the Entertainment coupon here!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,5,3,WEfRvD8IJXRG5MxMRGRdlQ

Someone must have called in, since one bartender on a Saturday night was not enough. We sat in the seating area off the bar in the lounge but had to go up to the bar to order; even going up involved about a 5-10 minute wait to order drinks and get some menus and then another wait to put in the food order. The food however didn't take too long to come out.

My friend ordered the New York steak and eggs and I got the tater tot nachos without the jalapeños. The steak looked mediocre and was cooked very well done. That plate came with a ton of toast and some all right looking potatoes. My tater tots were okay - the chilli was pretty good and the tots were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside without being at all greasy, but the 'garlic aioli' looked like nothing more than just a sour cream or a mayonnaise drizzled from a squeeze bottle, and the flavor was so subtle compared to the chili and cheez whiz I couldn't have told you what was in it if you paid me.

The Lodge was an okay place to sit and unwind and watch some Olympics coverage after a night out, but for actual food at 3am, I wish we'd either gotten something overpriced on the strip before going to the car to head home, gone to Denny's for the 2-4-6-8 menu, or just gone through a drive thru.",C153mp-HHFvf5G9LetRaTg,1,0,2,soDvSaAsJUWOe2B9Hr87YQ
