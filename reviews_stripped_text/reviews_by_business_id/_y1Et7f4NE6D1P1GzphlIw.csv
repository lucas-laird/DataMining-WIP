And the pizza is always bomb to me.

But the guest service isnt always good. It's a hit or miss. I always get barbecue for my sauce and every time I tell them that, I always sense a bad attitude. I'm not sure what the big deal is. Do you have to pre-prep your sauce or is it because you have to walk ""so far"" to the other end of the counter to get the bottle of bbq sauce? Regardless, it isn't a huge deal for a worker to get upset. 

At this location, I love going in and seeing this amazing guy named CHASE. He is always up beat, enthusiastic, smiling, and giving such a positive experience every single time I go in.

Think of Blaze as Pizza meets Chipotle...pick from original or gluten-free dough...then the sky's the limit from there!!

Have to take a stab at the management. Jared. Seemed as though he was in charge. There seemed to me some miscommunication on customers and together/separate orders. Seemed like the manager Jared was a bit flustered.

Unprofessional, and not very good management skills.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised!! The line went fast, there were plenty of FaNtAsTiC topping choices. Not just your typical toppings but a wide variety, several sauces, multiple cheeses to choose from, plenty of veggies, even a salad pizza! 

They have specialty pizzas you can order as well but to me for the price of build your own, I'd build my own every time I go! It's very affordable, we got a pizza each but if we could agree on the sauce, lol, we could get one pizza and it would have only been about $12 for 2 adults. But it was $22 for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks and we ended up bringing a whole pizza home, half of each of our own pizzas, so we had lunch for Sunday!  To me, that's a pretty good deal. 

The atmosphere was nice and despite being there near closing I never felt rushed or hassled by the employees. Props! I can't tell you how many times that has happened at other places and it's so rude. EVERY employee I dealt with this Saturday night was kind and courteous at Blaze! ?

I didn't like how incredibly thin the pizza was. I didn't like the already made salads that were very overpriced and quite small and flavorless.  I didn't like how when trying to ask for toppings to be placed on my veggie pizza the girl kept asking after each and every topping, ""are you done?"" And that question began after topping #2! I didn't like how they offer only ONE size pizza and NO option for even a smaller size for kids. That means share a one topping pizza with my picky 9 year old or get more pizza then we really need. I chose to go for more pizza thinking leftover pizza would be welcome later. Well, to my surprise, that thin pizza doesn't really fill you at all so my 9 year old ate her entire pizza in one sitting. My husband and I shared a pizza and I had two very small slices and the above mentioned flavorless salad. Total cost of meal....just shy of $30.

While there are ""signature"" pizza options, this looks like it's more of a build your own pizza spot- you start at one end to get your crust/dough, and move down a long line of toppings and let 4-6 people know what things to go ahead and add before they throw it in a wood fired oven for a few minutes. What floored me was that the build your own pizza was under $8- with all the toppings your want! Most places start with plain cheese and charge you per topping. I think the plain cheese Simple Pie is $5 and a 1-topping is $6 and some change. The place is clean and well organized. 

My pizza had red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, turkey meatballs, spinach, roasted garlic cloves, artichoke hearts, and olives- and it was amazing!! Filling, too - I only managed to finish about half of it (which means you can share... unless you and your friend can't agree on toppings).

They have online ordering which is a huge plus.

If you're on a time crunch, be sure to snag a menu at the start of the line to get an idea of what toppings you may or may not want. There are a few standard pizza options for you to choose from or use as a base to your own creation. You have about 3 crust types to choose from and from there, no topping is off limits. 

I used their Red Vine as a base for mine and added pepperoni, turkey meatball and artichoke... it was SO GOOD! I loved that their crust was a little more crisp than what I was expecting (800 degrees type crust, a little dough-y). I want to clarify that the crust was perfect as I enjoy a little crunch.

When you walk up there is a list of potential pizzas as well as toppings.  Similar to a Chipotle you then go down the line and build your pizza.  I tired a couple sauces.

I chose a regular crust pizza and got no sauce. I added mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, tomatoes, artichoke, and ricotta cheese. Then when the pizza came out of the oven, I had them drizzle some olive oil over the top. Simple yet delicious. My boyfriend heard unlimited toppings and went crazy. He got the high rise pizza dough which is thicker crust, and then added tons of cheese, and almost all the meats they had. He also got extra cheese. Don't be afraid to ask for more toppings. They only give you a handful of the toppings you ask for, but you can always ask for more. 

They say the pizzas take about 190 seconds or around 3 minutes to cook, but his took a little longer because of the mountain of toppings he had. One thing I can say is I saw some of the pizzas come out of the oven looking like shit. Some of them got stuck to the pans, and I saw one dude scrape off cheese and toppings and put it back on the pizza. I'm glad that wasn't my pie. I would make sure to keep an eye on them when they come out the oven though. 

I was just about to pay and leave when I saw their premade salads next to the register. I chose the berry arugula salad and it was bomb. It had fresh blackberries, creamy goat cheese, and peppery arugula tossed in some type of balsamic vinaigrette. I wished I had gotten more than just a single serving.

This evening the computer system was down and this is the 3rd time we have been impacted by this.  There was no communication to the customers and the team members not once apologized for the more than 20 minutes of delay.  The lines were long and you have got to figure how to better manage this issue and have a backup in cases like this.  We are a family of 5 that only got cold pizza and no drinks until the system came back up.  I suggest you show appreciation for your guests and apology when your establishment creates a less than desired circumstance.,47-H4-nu6vZnzDFFeDDiyg,0,0,1,mEBVMD7vCfUtTi9UFe-K5Q

Even when it's busy you don't have to wait around for anything . The first time I tried it , I brought one pizza home just so everyone could try it . When we finished that pie , we went right back to Blaze and got 2 more . It's a pretty place too . It's definitely something to try.

2337400,2017-08-11,0,_y1Et7f4NE6D1P1GzphlIw,"When staying with friends for the week in North LV we opted for ordering a batch of pizzas for dinner - five adults and three children.  Blaze was a recommendation from our friends as a good local pizza shop who had a variety of specialty pizzas as well as gluten free options (our friend's family has dietary restrictions). 

We ordered a variety of pies including the Art Lover and Red Vine. I enjoyed the size of the pizzas since they were small enough for each adult to have their own. I also liked that their dough was perfectly cooked and their sauce wasn't overwhelming - two things I always judge aside from the toppings and service. 

Overall, Blaze was good - but only just good. We're spoiled with Pizza Man Dan's back in Ventura so this place didn't quite satisfy that pizza craving we were hoping for. The toppings were simple on both pizzas and nothing special to note about either.

I don't doubt that dining-in customers have different experiences, but for pick-up, and the pizzas we ordered, they were just okay. 

Perhaps we'll have to try them again the next time we're in town!",UA7VUtuYZsrH0nGjALsKNw,1,0,4,XoFjixFP4cG6smRDseIF7g

2399136,2015-09-12,1,_y1Et7f4NE6D1P1GzphlIw,"I have eaten at Blaze four times. Three out of our four trips to this restaurant were terrible experiences. I will not go back.

The first time my fiance and I ate at Blaze, it was wonderful. We went on opening day, got free pizza, and it was delicious. The service was great. The food was great. We thought we found a new go-to eating spot. My one complaint was that I purchased a smore and asked it to be warmed up. They forgot to warm the smore up, and I had to go up and ask for it after ten minutes. It was terrible at room temperature. I decided I wouldn't order that again.

We went back to Blaze for a second time about a week later. We waited an excessive amount of time to receive our pizza, and when we did, our pizza was burnt. They took my fiance's pizza back and made him a new one for free. They tried to tell me my BURNT pizza was normal. I told them it was unacceptable. So they made me a new one as well. My new pizza didn't come out until after my fiance was done eating his new pizza. However, my fiance's new pizza was STILL BURNT. The manager, Jared, brought out his new pizza, looked at the bottom, acknowledged that it was still burnt, and served it to my fiance anyway. My fiance felt obligated to eat the pizza because Jared gave us free pizza cards to come back at a later date, and my fiance felt it just wasn't worth the trouble to get a third pizza in the hopes that this pizza would not be burnt. We were not the only ones receiving burnt pizzas. Several other people had pizzas that need to be remade because they were burnt, and Jared was handing out free pizza cards to other people.

On our third trip to Blaze, we used the free pizza cards given to us because we had burnt pizzas. My fiance's pizza was again burnt. We kept the pizza because they were free.

We decided to give Blaze one more chance and we went back for our forth and final time. Everyone in the line to pick your toppings was cheerful and friendly. The lady at the register was very kind and happy. We sat down and waited for our pizzas. My fiance's name was called. He brought his pizza over and went back up to wait for mine. To be clear, we ordered our pizzas together at the exact same time. Our pizzas went in at the same time. They came out at the same time. Over five minutes pass and my name has still not been called. My pizza was sitting under the heat lamp while it was passed over for other people who ordered after me to receive there pizzas. So my fiance's pizza was sitting on our table getting cold while my pizza was sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be cut and served to me for over five minutes. I had to explicitly ask why my pizza was just sitting there and ask to be served my pizza. If I hadn't, it would have sat there for who knows how long. They did not offer to make us fresh pizzas. They didn't say anything at all. Just handed me my pizza like it wasn't a big deal that my fiance's pizza was now cold and mine had been under a heat lamp. To top it all off, my fiance's pizza was burnt FOR THE THRID TIME. Three out of our four times at Blaze, he was knowingly given a burnt pizza. Unacceptable.

We ate our pizza and I asked to speak with the manager, Jared. I told Jared everything I wrote above from our first time at Blaze to our last time at Blaze. Jared's exact words were ""okay."" I replied with ""okay?"" And he said ""I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry that happened. But you two are the only ones who have ever had a problem here."" He tried to make it seem as though we should be okay with poor service and burnt pizza. And it he lied when saying we were the only ones who had a problem because many people had a problem with their burnt pizzas on our second trip to Blaze. Further, he said ""well, that's just one piece that was burnt"" because we saved one piece of my fiance's burnt pizza to show Jared that the pizza was burnt, again. The whole pizza was burnt, but he tried to make it out like only one slice was burnt. Regardless of if just one slice or the whole pizza was burnt, a customer should never be served any burnt pizza. Ever. 

Jared was completely unprofessional, rude, and dismissive of our complaints. Needless to say, we will never go back to Blaze. We are much happier going to their competitors and giving them our money instead.",zkHxJLvX8xDp7sT5x74_ag,9,0,1,gJnMGC0qIHpR8BdSEp5Awg

The Blaze concept mirrors another well known burrito place based in Denver Colorado.  You start by waiting in a usually waiting in a line with at least 10-15 people.  Don't worry it will move fast and it is well worth the wait.  

1st choice- sauce traditional red, white cream, or spicy red
2nd choice- cheese- mozzarella 2 types, parm, goat, feta, goat, or gorgonzola or vegan cheese
3rd choice- meats - sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, ham, bacon, chicken, and turkey meatballs
4th  choice- veggies - artichokes, olives, kalamata olives, banana peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes, basil, spinach, garlic chopped or roasted, mushrooms, pineapple, oregano, and red peppers. and I am sure there is more.  

Your delicious masterpiece goes into the oven and if you like it can be finished with 5th choice - Arugala, bbq sauce, pesto, or olive oil.  

Any way you build your own it will be AMAZING!!. For just $7 and some change.

You pick out you dough, cheese, and you get as many toppings as you could possibly want for no additional charge! They make sure you are pleased with your pizza, you will get asked multiple times if everything is tasting okay or if you need anything. They are on top of cleaning. The pizza TASTE AMAZING! Everything about this place was great. Loved it. We will be back again! 

OH & if I had to make one personal suggestion on another topping option... I would ask them to include asparagus that would make this place even better!",ciYSmNqAoJDHDlI6IvvWMA,1,1,5,8HcPr_05ouZUNmtYqT2w0g

You enter and they get your name and write it on a napkin, then you either order a traditional pizza or you create your own. I created my own :) they put a pizza crust down and you tell them what you want and YES they know what WHITE PIZZA is!! So many places I go to, don't. On a white pizza there's no red sauce it's an Alfredo sauce, it's just a good change. So they have an array of items you can choose to have on your pizza - they slide it down the table like at a sandwich shop. You can add just about anything you want, they literally have all kinds of toppings. I chose 1/2 red and 1/2 white sauce - a friend was with me and we were splitting it. Then we added roasted garlic, spinach, black olives and ricotta cheese omg! The maker hands it off to the cooker who throws it into the brick oven and within a few minutes they're yelling your name! All the crusts were the same, a nice thin, crispy crust. The pizza was great and they have beer, wine and an array of soft drinks and water.",-SjQXQd-IRfOdUdYYwWGOQ,1,1,5,5WwBGiDuIeigwvSMVCs4tA

Imagine a car factory running out of air bags but deciding to produce cars with no airbags due to their Mismanagement. They need to put policy in place where somebody (usually a manager or something) orders more mushrooms when more mushrooms are needed.

I was pretty surprised that you can have unlimited toppings for only about $8. It's a self pizza but me and the beau shared one and I left satisfied. The toppings seemed fresh. They make the pizza and than it takes about 8-10 minutes and it's done. Fresh and bomb!

We topped our pizzas half and half. I was able to put my own toppings on one half of the pizza while the beau did his thing on the other half. And it's thin crust.. My favorite. You can also get a ""rising crust"" if you wanted to.

One tip- know your order before you get up the the counter. People are anxiously waiting in line and when you can't decide and take too long, it makes others (myself included) get a little hangry. 
The first time ordering can be a bit intimidating, but you will quickly get the hang of it. They will walk you through the process.
I love how quickly the pizza comes out and how crunchy, crisp, and thin the crust is. I call it a pizza cracker. There is a build your own option or a few a popular pizza combos. 
We ordered 2 BYO and one drink and it was under 20$. I took a few slices home to eat for dinner. I left feeling satisfied but not overstuffed and greasy which is a good thing. 
I liked that there was an employee working the dining room. She cleared tables, wiped them down, and asked how we enjoyed our meal and if we needed anything. A nice extra touch.
 I would warn this place is LOUD so don't come here for an intimate date. There are tables outside but eating near all the cars in the parking lot is really not my idea of enjoyable. 
Yay to a great pizza option in LV.
* I would like to see all employees wearing hair nets under their hats. Also the hair needs to be pulled back under the hat- so many ladies had pieces of hair dangling out from underneath- too close to the pizzas and ingredients. :/",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,7,4,4,8XAjXJDrYdEAHYSSRfuUqw

After being an avid fan of this location for years (despite only writing a review this year-oops) I had an awful experience on April 2nd around 11:30. Nuvia was assigned to making our pizza. She mumbled the whole time so we couldn't hear her and wouldn't repeat herself when asked. We were splitting a pizza 50/50 and she didn't disperse the toppings evenly-we had to ask her to redo the meat as the ""half"" with pepperoni had about 9 pieces of pepperoni covering two or three bites right on the crust. They were out of cherry tomatoes (which I know isn't her fault), but the BLT salad had cherry tomatoes. That leads me to question when the salad was made if they didn't have any fresh tomatoes...Speaking of the salad, it's already pre-made and just needs to be boxed up when you order it. It wasn't given to use when we paid, or when our pizza was ready. I had to go ask Bob, the cashier, for our salad. He asked Julia if she had made that salad yet, to which she responded ""LOL NO"", literally laughing at him as I'm sitting here waiting for the salad 15 minutes after we ordered it. Julia finally boxed the salad up, but then I had to wait for them to find a container to give me dressing. They were totally disorganized. There were probably 8-10 people behind the counter and a grand total of 6 customers who had all ordered at separate times and they couldn't get it together. Another gem of this experience? There was a new girl training and I overheard them telling her that secret shoppers are older people and to treat them differently, cater to them, etc. Oh, ok! Good to know that those of us who aren't ""older"" get sub-par service because there's no chance we're secret shoppers. Such a joke. It will likely be a while before we head back to this location.

At Blaze, you can forget that sharing is caring and order your own personal size pizza for under $10. What I love about this place is that pizzas are fully customizable, or you can opt in for their signature styles. There dozens of toppings and sauces, plus three types of dough: traditional, gluten-free, and high-rise. If you want a ""lighter"" pizza, go with the traditional; it's a thin and has a crunchy crust. The high-rise will no doubt fill you up. After pizzas are made, they're slid into a fiery oven and cooked within minutes. Unlike other pizza shops in town that operate on a similar concept, my pizzas have always been baked to perfection -- never undercooked.

Hubby and I stopped by for dinner a few days ago during the grand opening and a nice girl at the door gave us both BOGO coupons. There were a few tables occupied, but no long line like some of my friends faced when visiting during grand opening week. They have a good amount of tables inside and they also have some tables outside. After looking over the menu and placing my order, I watched the pizza artists work their magic making my pizza and I was impressed with the variety of toppings offered. Pizzas are made in 180 seconds once in the oven and are all $7.65 each plus tax and you can choose from one of their signature pizzas or build your own choosing the cheeses and toppings you like. I ended up liking my pizza a lot and came back for dinner tonight. Service was just as friendly and I again enjoyed my pizza. 

Build Your Own - I chose classic red sauce, shredded mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and pineapples. The sauce was good as the toppings. I really liked the thin crust that was chewy yet perfectly crisp.

Art Lover - This is one of their signature pizzas with artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic and red sauce dollops. The crust was consistent with my previous visit and I again enjoyed my pizza. The only problem with this pizza for me was that I tasted no garlic. It's possible it was forgotten when the pizza was being made, but garlic is a flavor that stands out and it was hiding this time, boo! 

You can get your food to-go like I did and you can also place your order online. I'm a fan and will be back to try other pizza creations :)",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,41,42,4,CdrSJ6f2mZDhbc2xoCWDVg

3737586,2016-02-07,4,_y1Et7f4NE6D1P1GzphlIw,"How To Basics: 

Personalized pizza with the build as you order concept. You order what you like and they build your pizza in steps (made-from-scratch crust, Sauce, Cheese, Toppings then they bake it). Think Chipotle or Subway. Got it? Good. Easy, quick, and damn delicious. 

Cost: 

$7.65 per individual pizza with as many toppings as your heart desires. Load that puppy up and have no regrets. I love the flat rate and that they are generous with their toppings. No charging you an arm and a leg to add extra cheese/sauce/veggies or whatever artisanal ingredients you top your pizza with. They will pop it in their oven and it will be ready to go quickly. Crispy, crunchy and delicious. 

Taste:  

My husband and I have been here twice and we LOVED it!  I ordered their  'VEG OUT' both times. The Veg Out has zucchini, mushrooms, red onion, mozzarella, gorgonzola, red sauce dollops. I loaded up more veggies: artichokes, chopped garlic, red onion, roasted red peppers and spicy marinara sauce. 

My husband orders their 'MEAT EATER' that includes pepperoni, crumbled meatballs, red onion, mozzarella and red sauce (he also throws extra veggies on his.. Cuz' why not?!). We even had them cook it 'well done' so we had an extra crispy crust. 

Final Thoughts:
Quick, easy, convenient and fresh. We're in and out with our 'tum tums' full of 'Blaze' goodness. We enjoy their pizza and plan to keep this on our lunch rotation.

I chose a garlic pesto sauce, grilled chicken, also with peppers and onions .

The likes: I liked the huge selection of toppings, which the staff was generously put atop the pizza. The dough had a rim to keep the toppings from falling off. Everyone was super friendly. The manager even came by to ask how we liked it. The unlimited amount of toppings did not effect the one priced pizza. It's nice not to pay per topping!

Well over 20mins goes by and my name hasn't been called came to the point where I start seeing people that came after me get their food already. So my husband goes up and asks them where the order is since their oven cooks your pizza in 180 seconds and we have been waiting for over 20mins, I guess someone forgot to fire them up. So we had been waiting that whole time for nothing. You would think since they had over 15 people working that everything would get done on time. Once we finally got our pizzas I started eating mine and notice that my sauce wasn't even on my pizza and had to go back up, after waiting already just to get my food. Overall I LOVED the pizza!

Done and had been for 5 minutes (according to the gentleman that put them there) but the sticker on the box has a 7:59 time stamp.

4655406,2016-07-16,4,_y1Et7f4NE6D1P1GzphlIw,"After driving up to Cathedral Rock to enjoy the cool temperature I ended up in Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza to enjoy the hot temperature. That is the hot temperature of an 11 inch custom made pizza pie prepared in an oven at 800 degrees. 

  This Blaze Fast-Fire'd (abbreviated Blaze Pizza) is located in the rapidly developing shopping cluster near the North  Decatur at the 215 interchange in the Winco-Target Shopping Center. Blaze Pizza was asphalt when I  reviewed this Winco and Firehouse Subs not so long ago. Just like the shopping cluster by North Decatur and the 215, Blaze Pizza is growing. This is the newest location in the Las Vegas valley. 

  After my brother and I hiked in Cathedral Rock on Monday, we made it to Blaze Pizza around 6:30 PM. At this time on a weekday, it was busy. Fortunately there were plentiful tables. And fortunately I knew the Blaze Pizza routine from my original visit at the Eastern Avenue Henderson location (https://www.yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-fired-pizza-henderson). 

  From the point of ordering to getting the pizza, Blaze Pizza is all about building your own custom pizza. A statistician would be able to show a formula of how the customer could eat here every day and have a different pizza pie for at least a month. This paragraph shows the process through my experience. As soon as I made it to the order and pay station, the lady there asked me if I'd been here before. I did and ordered one of their signature pies with additional toppings. Because they were out of meatballs and regular sausage, I ordered the Link In signature pizza pie. This includes mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage, red peppers, and sautéed onions. After I paid $10.70 for the Link In ($7.95) and a small Coke ($1.95), she marked the pizza on a box on the start of its route on the assembly line. My next stop was the toppings station. If the Subway toppings station is Exploration Park Hill, the Blaze Pizza toppings station would be Mount Charleston. The selection of toppings is massive. It was here that I opted out of the red sauce that is included with the Link In for the spicy red sauce. I'd compliment the pizza pie with black olives and mushrooms. From there the customized pizza pie traveled into the 800 degree oven. I'd wait for a few minutes. I'd get slightly concerned when the customers that ordered after me were picking up their pies. When I looked toward the pick up area, I noticed that when the man took the pizza out of the oven that he immediately cut it into six slices. I also observed that Blaze Pizza is popular with families. 

   I was very happy with the pizza. The spicy red sauce was the winning ingredient that elevated the pizza pie to greatness. Supporting the spicy red sauce were the first-rate ingredients that made up the pie. All the fresh  first-rate ingredients created a first-rate pizza pie that was a pleasure to eat to the last crumb. 

 The first-rate 800-degree custom made pizza deserves a hot rating. Without further due, I declare this Blaze Pizza ""4 Stars.""",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,6,7,4,k_4LPStaCSmItLRnQ5xZLQ

She was also a bit short with us but not nearly as bad as she was being with the other two.  It was very obvious the guests were getting aggravated trying to order their food and she was replying what seemed to be very sassy remark's. Even after the two young gentleman received their food she continued out onto the floor and actually touched his wallet and his cell phone while they were eating. She was totally harassing them while they were just sitting quietly trying to eat their dinner. I think that management needs to intervene and teach Maria and maybe coach her a better way on how to speak to guests and how to keep her hands to herself.

Communicate with who is making your pizza and I assure you they will make it how you like it and don't forget to tip if you get the good service because honestly everyone I've come across here is typically great!so if they aren't having a good day it's probably due to some customer made it that way ..

Today, I would classify, as one of the worst experiences I've ever had regarding customer service. I'll further expand on this by saying that Jared (or Gerald), who is the General Manager is by far the most unprofessional manager I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Based on his attitude and behavior, I'd say that the mantras of your Management Training Program are ""The Customer Is ALWAYS Wrong"",  and ""The Only Way To Hold A Conversation Is Through Being Argumentative and Impossible"".
Here's the gist:
I placed an online order tonight. It's the first time I've ever used your app to order (I've got some feedback on the app if you would like to hear it sometime). I was actually happy to see that when I placed my order, the app stated that my pizza would be prepared, but wouldn't be fired until I checked in with the cashier. I thought this was a great touch, cause my pizza would be piping hot when I got it!! I ordered three Build your owns. The only special instructions I had on one of the pizzas was that I wanted pesto on the crust. Yum! I selected that I would be at the restaurant at 8:15. Sadly, I didn't get there until 8:21. 
When I walked in, I went to the cashier, and signed my receipt. I hung out, and waited for my pizzas to come out of the oven. After a few short moments, one of the guys working the station where the pizzas get cut and boxed, turned around and grabbed three pizza boxes from the top of the oven. The other gentleman called my name and handed me the boxes. I'm my past experiences, the person opens the boxes and shows you the pizzas. I've always thought this was a nice touch because it gives you a chance to chance to check your order. This didn't happen. I stopped at a table and checked my order. Two of the three pizzas were supposed to be finished with BBQ Sauce. Sadly, they weren't. I headed back to the counter and the gentleman fixed the discrepancy. 
As I grabbed the boxes, I found it odd that the pizzas had been pulled from the top of the oven, and they felt lukewarm, not hot. 
Unfortunately, I had other food in the car, and a diabetic girlfriend at home that had already taken her insulin shot and had to eat soon, so I wasn't able to do much about it.
I drove home, which is literally 5 minutes away (Though my maps app says 7...guess I'm a little heavy on the gas!). When I got into the house my suspicions were confirmed. The pizzas were not hot. They were actually to the point where the ovalini mozzarella on two of the pizzas was thick and stiff. It was a letdown. So I decided to call the store and ask why my pizzas were fired before I checked in. After about 5 or so minutes, I was able to speak to Jared (or Gerald). The very first thing I asked him was if the app says to check in so your pizzas would get fired, the. Why were mine cooked and sitting on top of the oven. This was where things quickly went downhill. The first thing he said is ""If your pizzas weren't ready when you walked in the door, then you'd be complaining about that too"". I was really caught off guard by that comment. I told him I didn't Ming waiting the four or five minutes it takes to cook the pizza to get it fresh. He then said ""Your order said ASAP on it, so you indicated that you wanted them right away when you ordered them"". I told him that I did no such thing. He then said ""All I can tell you is that you need to pay more attention when you're ordering your pizzas to make sure you don't put ASAP in the special instructions"". I again told him I didn't do that. I told him that the only special instructions were that on one of the pizzas I asked for pesto on the crust. He then said ""Well someone at some point put in your order that you wanted them ASAP"". I told him again, that I never used the app before, so that wasn't possible. His tone and demeanor continued to decline and it got to the point where I couldn't even talk. He kept cutting me off and accusing me of some wrongdoing. Eventually, I just asked for a District Managers Name / Phone Number. He then told me I could file a complaint on the companies website. He also made it clear that I needed to make sure that you knew the ticket said ASAP, as if to continue to imply that I was in the wrong. 
I was beyond furious at this point, for several reasons.
Needless to say, I have contacted the company via email & Twitter. I can only hope that they do something with the Manager at this location.",hnhTHPE9_6OQrEZocNw4gQ,3,0,1,aV0cvK3xBYKD6AqZgdXetw

When you're in a hurry, I'd recommend ordering online. When your order is ready for pick-up, you just mosey over to the cashier and they'll fire up your pizza in the oven. Otherwise, waiting in line may take a sec because Blaze always has a crowd.

A bit of background, if I may. I have worked in the customer service industry, on the Las Vegas Strip,  for the last ten years for a company who prides itself on top notch customer service and employee/customer interaction. This company, who shall remain nameless (but it rhymes with Beazers), hasn't the first clue on how to motivate employees to WANT to provide this level of service. That being said, I have no idea how Blaze does it, but every time I walk into this place (at least twice a week)  I feel like each and every employee there is happy to be there. Their smiles are genuine and even during the busiest of times, the great attitudes never fail. I've seen them cope with mistakes and miss-ordered food without a single slip in their service standards. I've never seen an unhappy customer there either, and that's saying something. I know that the bar is set pretty low for places like this, but they consistently achieve so much more than you'd expect that they're rapidly becoming my favorite place to eat.

So, in no specific order, let me thank the team who served my son and I last night:
Gina, Felix, Eduardo, Michael, Courtland, Angelo and Cesar thank you all very much!!",8Fi5b2YAaDlBLmpYh72yMA,0,0,5,UlKfy8LXHHdORoWU1vTzog

Around the 3 and 4th slice I could taste the difference which kinda threw me off a little but surprisingly satisfying. 
My wife ordered the veg out pie and the kids had the same as me w some squash, quinoa and Caesar salad.

In terms of toppings, I like the sausage here a lot better than Pieology's sausage.  All other elements seem similar, but they do have a few additional toppings here that are not available at Pieology.  They also serve beer and have blood orange lemonade.

I complained how they were so chintzy with their portion.  I asked if they could add more cheese and the young man gave an attitude.   Then when we tried to talk to the manager and he was a real jerk. Wouldn't  listen to us and talked over us and was raising his voice at us.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.  It's sad the rest of the employees seems really descent but this young man and the manager has THE WORST customer service.  I will tell my friends not to come here.  So owner of this location if you're reading this teach your manager customer service.  It's the manager who's working at around 2:00 pm.

Well, after devouring my first 180-second fired pizza, I became a Blaze believer.  First of all, the price is right for the Build Your Own Pizza, where you can add as many toppings as you want for $7.65.  Their Signature Pizzas, where the ingredients are already laid out for you, are also only $7.65.  I like the Veg Out, Red Vine, and the White Top for these.  Secondly, well, the pizza comes out fast!  And, thirdly, they are delicious, not at all greasy. 

This location is only two exits away from us so it makes it easy to get here and get our Blaze fix, which we've been doing at least once a week now.  The staff is super friendly and even if there's a line, it moves fairly quickly, plus you know your pizza will be ready in no time.  I usually can't finish the six slices that each pizza has, so my pizza is good for two meals, making my money go even further.  I'm lovin' it.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,6,7,4,YR_yXqibOBbIJqFmCy6NYg

The ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter were very nice and helpful.  The restaurant is very modern and a hipster kind of aura around it.  They have a few pre made set ups but you can build your own and its a great way to mix things up.  Once you throw everything you want on the pizza you sit and they call you up after it comes out the oven.  The line starts all the way to the right behind the little wall.  On a little side note I bought my sister one of the remade salads and she devoured that s*** in like 2 minutes so I'm pretty sure it was pretty good.,B855Q1HFe8HKZ9zytQONYw,12,10,5,PMrJyubJCYIYRYPwe7xzSw

Best way I can describe it is ""A CHIPOTLE STYLE RESTAURANT BUT FOR PIZZA."" To order you either chose from pre-determined ingredients signature pizza or make your own. You pick your dough, sauce, type of cheese, meat, veggies. Afterwards they throw your creation into an oven for a few minutes and it comes out crispy and delicious. I love either the meat lovers or barbecue chicken. Making your own pizza can be very satisfying too. The more toppings and the more colorful the better. Lines here can get a bit long because the workers move the pizza along in single file. They also have pizza boxes for taking your left orders to go.

I have had this little gem bookmarked for a couple of months but kept seeing many Yelp friends checking in. After a long hike on Sunday, I suggested to hubby that we check it out. Little did I know, he had already been here for lunch with workmates! 

We walked in and there was a line but for obvious reasons. Your pizza is handmade to your liking!
When we made it to the front of the line we were warmly greeted by Chase. Chase was lively and entertaining to say the least. Hubby wanted to keep the pizza simple since it was my first time so I let him do the ordering. We opted for a fresh tomato/mozzarella with mushrooms. In addition, we ordered the arugula sale with fresh fruit. We looked around for plates and utensils and low and behold Deborah appeared and kindly explained that most people use the boxes to eat on. She even went as far as to tearing up the box and making us both plates. Next, she saw I was missing my salad and went back to grab it for me. Deborah delivered the best customer service I have received in quite sometime and she was super pleasant and happy to help. I immediately tipped her and expressed my appreciation for her assistance. I hope the management team knows what gems they have with both Deborah and Chase! 

Ok, back to the pizza. As my opening sentence expresses, sooooooo good was this pie! Wow! I did not expect this quality but my doors were blown off. I have been to a couple of other make it yourself pizza places, but hands down Blaze is the best I have ever had. I will be back here again and although I don't live near by, after my next hike in another week I will be stopping by again for more deliciousness! Good news!!

For one price you get unlimited toppings!!! I really like that.  Some of the competitors charge upwards of $1 per topping (I'm looking at you, Novecento).  And they have a LOT of toppings!!  Even fancy stuff like fresh arugula and sea salt.  

And get this...the staff actually looked me in the eye and smiled...and most of them even looked like they bathed that morning.  Amazing.
