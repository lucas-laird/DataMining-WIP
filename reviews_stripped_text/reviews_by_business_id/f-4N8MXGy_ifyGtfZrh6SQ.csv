This is exactly what happened at 7:10 pm on Jan 27.  Marvic and the cook took the liberty to yell at the top of those lungs that they do not honor typical Popeyes coupons that are advertised as specials. I remind you - this is on their website and coupons that state this it is valid only at this location. I at least give Marvic credit for ""checking up"" on possible acceptance but the cool came running out in his green apron to yell with confidence that ""we don't accept those coupons - I don't care what the website says"". I asked him if he even knew what they website said and he said yes. Yet he could not reiterate word by word but his hubris won't even let him look. Very bad service. And it's like my second grade teacher who once said "" it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for the rest of the bunch"". Well, Marvic, I will not only boycott your location but all popeyes locations. I cater a lot and now the other franchisees lost out. You probably don't care as you proudly told me ""I'm an independent franchisee..."" .  Loud and clear El Capitan!

My husband and I arrived at International McCarran Airport LV on Sat and ordered family meal 8pcs and popcorn chicken dinner.

I took a chance to talk to customer service at Popeyes just to see if they remembered me. Very helpful Marjorie (cashier) remembered me she said she was trying to catch me on Sat but I was already gone. No hesitations..

Fortunately, the fianc√©e (then mere girlfriend) and I like fried chicken (part of our bond is a mutual weakness for KFC). A little research threw up Popeyes as an option for lunch when we flew out of McCarran

It's definitely a fast food operation but that meant the line moved quickly. I love that in the USA, customers get a choice of white or dark meat. So, we ended up with chicken, biscuits, fries and corn on the cob

I enjoyed the chicken - moist with a crispy seasoned coating. Sides were ok. It was a good meal for airport food though I think Lolos fried chicken at Phoenix airport still wins my best airport fried chicken award

Incidentally, Popeyes is in terminal C but terminals A, B, C and D all join up airside so you can still eat there if you're flying from any of those gates",OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,10,9,4,lps2i8nNek5eMgYkDWrndA

I had a layover at McCarran coming from Houston and found this Popeye's roaming around the Southwest Terminal. I probably missed seeing Popeye's before since it's a bit past the tram which I take instead of walking that long terminal.

It's pricey at this location as one expects to be at the airport. $8 for 12 piece nuggets, a side, biscut, and drink. My fav here is not the chicken, it's the red beans and rice.

2553334,2017-08-22,3,f-4N8MXGy_ifyGtfZrh6SQ,"Airport food. The thought conjurs images of bad meals at high prices in rushed circumstances. That's actually not too far off from most experiences. The last several years have seen an attempt to curb that expectation. Nicer spots. Local spots. Fresher food. Popeyes is none of those things. It's the original thought: overpriced food in rushed circumstances. 

Look, I've been to Popeyes a few times before. About ten years ago I discovered it out of town and actually really liked it. It's much better than the colonel's, I thought, and with a southern flair I really appreciated. So I thought I knew what to expect. But this really missed the mark, even for marginal airport food.

I had some time. Not a ton, but enough that I could have eaten somewhere a little nicer. But hey, it's been several years since I had Popeyes and it sounded good. I arrived, and even though there was a line it moved quite quickly. I ordered a five-piece tender basket (spicy) and even though it was going to be a few extra minutes, as they let me know, I went ahead with the order while they made a new batch.

For value, I actually think you're doing okay here. It's close to 12 bucks or so for this, but it's a lot of food--you get five impressively large tenders, a biscuit, and one side. If you opt for the full combo, you get a drink for an extra couple of bucks.

Unfortunately, quantity far outpaced quality. Yes, they were piping hot when I got them, but the tenders were not good. Even though I had waited for the spicy, there was no spice like I've tasted at Popeyes before. They were long and stringy, and I actually had a hard time biting through a couple of them, as they were spongy and bouncy. Not exactly the adjectives one would want to use when describing fried chicken. Twinkies, maybe, but not tenders.

The saving grace was the biscuit, and maybe the red beans and rice. They were both standard and dependable, and helped me get through some tenders. But I made a bad decision to eat here, and I'll own it. After I was done I had a bad taste in my mouth--literally and figuratively--and went elsewhere in the airport to find a smoothie to wash it out.",HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,6,0,2,-id5NHKbU6be0jSpiiDTwA

I was greeted well by the front cashier whom this one filipina? female called ""Junior."" He was very patient and respectful with a family before me who had no idea what to order and what was what. I usually don't frequent Popeyes and asked how was the jambalaya slide and the female working the food told me it was good.  She then asked if I wanted a sample.  I was actually quite shocked to be offered a sample at a fast food place.  That has never happened to me.  To be honest I didn't know exactly what jambalaya was so I decided that it was good enough to order.  I also asked for two breasts for my 2 pc combo, however she said it was another $1.8 charge. I respectfully declined the extra charge and ended up getting the breast and a leg.  

When I received my order, I sat down and saw she snuck in two legs and a breast.  She probably noticed I was a starving poor student, but either way the gesture was really nice of her and a pleasant surprise to have this type of customer service at a fast food place.

Whether you are a fan of Popeyes' mild or spicy recipe, 
It is sure to satisfy your hunger cravings.

4 Stars overall due to prompt service. I was in and out pretty quickly and the food was piping hot. Chicken was cooked perfectly- crisp on the outside and juicy, moist on the inside. Seasoning is delicious and I especially enjoy the fact that their chicken isn't as greasy as other fried chicken establishments.

I must add that the cost was a bit higher than your average Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen locations but what else would you expect from any business located in an airport.",GEmaBgrBPzUs92tUkIM2VA,14,13,4,ez3lVlcqzRiHVdNd5dlfZA

TWELVE DOLLAS????     

Whatever, I'm expensing it but come on these are crazy prices for what is $5 elsewhere. My sandwich was fast-food tasty meaning they charged me TWELVE dollars for like $1 in food costs.

Anyway, we went with the 12-piece family meal, which included 2 large sides and 6 biscuits (or was supposed to, at least). After 10 minutes or so, our food was ready!
We got the mild chicken (breast, thighs, wings, legs) and Cajun fries and cole slaw for the sides. The chicken was solid but they completely messed up the sides. They gave us a small of each of the sides and no biscuits! I was super disappointed. I went back and complained and they finally gave us a full large fries and 3 small cole slaws (I guess that's equivalent to a large). We were supposed to get 6 biscuits, but they only gave us 5. At this point, I was over it, so I let that last biscuit go.
The meal was super heavy (as expected); the fries were kind of cold, but it still held me over for a while. However, this meal along with 2 fountain drinks cost almost $50 - so not worth it! Don't eat here unless you absolutely have to.",6cBZYz36SYI1g0cYBYsteA,2,1,3,cac0pg4CJyw0NrFogRRADg

They have very good juicy chicken, catfish, love their rice and beans. I wish they had more locations throughout the city because they put kfc to shame.  This was my first time ordering breakfast from them (because I had a morning flight) and I ordered their chicken and biscuit and added an egg. WOW it was good.  I will say that their orange juice was very small though (maybe it's an airport thing, I don't know)  but I will definitely go back to any location",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,2,1,5,xMKyPWXetd10NVtVMPKEpw

The chicken was dried out and not the moist, crispy, mouthwatering taste that PLK are known for. Reading another Yelp from Brad G., it must have been under the heat lamp for awhile. Added to this, the service was slow. It can't be that hard to throw a wing, thigh, and drumstick into a box. Made me sad :-(",zwLq4aVDSH7HyMbVjKfkRg,2,1,2,Mz3apBJsJq7r46tLQ9ocOg

after a mad March Madness weekend, i needed something fried and chicken to help me get through the corridors at McCarran. enter Popeyes. two words for you. WOW. WOW. i thought it was a mirage. and the prices were pretty reasonable. $9 for 2 pieces, a biscuit and coleslaw. 8 mins later i was smitten. i was just full of smite. you could hit quads on the river to beat my flopped nut flush and i would still be full of glee after eating here. it was soooo gewd! washed down with some diet pepsi (of course) and i was ready to sit at my gate and wait. and nap.

We got a popcorn shrimp combo. The shrimp was freshly cooked and so crisp and yummy!  The fries didn't taste that fresh. The biscuit was good. They don't have any fountain water so if you need water, you need to buy a bottle.

5787469,2015-04-13,1,f-4N8MXGy_ifyGtfZrh6SQ,"The first time I had ever been to a Popeye's was in Dallas Fort Worth airport a few years ago!!!   I had an 8 hour layover on my flight to Paris.  I knew I had to try some southern comfort food and yes, it sure it the spot, I loved my lunch that day.  I still remember it cause I pigged out on fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, gravy, corn, and who knows what else lol ...  so, when I saw this Popeye's located at McCarran, I wanted to get something to eat for good ol' times sake ;)

I had just bought my sandwich at Jersey Mike's and definitely knew I wanted to sit down in this area to eat, so I planned on getting Cajun fries as a side!  but then I couldn't make up my mind, so I got both small french fries and a small mashed potatoes gravy :)  Well, what can I say, I love comfort foods and mashed potatoes are my #1 yummy in my tummy!  There is just something calming about creamy delicious mashed potatoes and for a fast food place, I would say in my opinion, Popeye's has one of the best you can get!!!  I love the flavor of the gravy too.  Plus they have good Louisiana hot sauce packets, I love spicy anytime!

The Cajun fries were great, went well with my Chipotle Steak sandwich.  The mashed potatoes hit the spot as usual, they were soooo yummy!  I believe I spent $3 or less on these two items and it was totally worth it, super cheap and tasty!  The staff working was friendly, my order came out less than a minute, right when I paid I got it!  I liked the area I was sitting in, so it was good to enjoy eating around 9am, and the tables around me where almost full.  I am glad I walked around the terminal first before I made my decisions on what to eat/drink, made a huge difference because I was more comfortable and could take my time!",dgMOxFJ_DeoReN7oSKte-w,4,2,4,oSYXV2g0DvoMXSR_jGiiUQ
