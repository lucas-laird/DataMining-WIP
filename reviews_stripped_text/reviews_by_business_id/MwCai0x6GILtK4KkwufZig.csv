21235,2011-10-19,0,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"I was visiting Las Vegas and brought a coupon via Travelzoo as the restaurant looked good. We went there on a Sunday night. I did make a reservation as requested on the coupon, and the restaurant did take make it. When we arrived the restaurant was only half full and a sign said to seat yourself. We shared one appetizer, the crab cake duo. That was pretty good with what tasted like real crabmeat, and not too much ratio to bread. For dinner we had the grilled rosemary salmon and the 14 oz angus rib eye steak. The steak was absolutely fabulous, however the salmon was so-so and the zucchini was barely cooked. That may have been because we think the kitchen messed up the salmon order, the waiter came to offer us extra wine. We ordered the fried oreo with vanilla ice cream for dessert that the waiter recommended. I've seen fried oreo but that was the first time I tried it. It was absolutely fabulous and I would recommend it. We didn't try the martinis, but the restaurant food was not bad. I am giving it a 4 for the odd seating, high tables with low tables on the other side.

124256,2011-12-04,1,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"A friend recently sent me a burger top 10 list from the Review Journal which included many local spots, the likes of which I've been trying to track down since starting this blog. Being the dummy that I am, I didn't pay attention to the date the article was posted until I tried to visit one of the locations only to find their kitchen is no longer open. Still determined to eat a burger that night, I tried a second location which had almost the same name but a totally different burger. That place is now called The Martini, and the burger was still really good.

The Martini is kind of a 'hip' local neighborhood spot in Summerlin, great for yuppie housewives and overage guys that are too lazy to go all the way to the strip. Aside from the few groups of cougars and strange middle aged men drinking expensive bottles of champagne on a random Wednesday night it seemed like an ok place to grab a bite to eat.

The burger from my list was no longer available, but in its place was an assembly with Wagyu Kobe beef, blue cheese, prosciutto, mushrooms, caramelized onions on a pretzel bun with Cabernet Demi for dipping. Quite a complex situation for such a basic spot, so I was very intrigued by this. They also offer an 'All American Burger' with more of the standard toppings, but I wasn't interested in that.
My larger burger came out looking quite good, and tasted equally good at the first bite. The meat was cooked a little beyond the medium-rare I had ordered, but still had great flavor. I'm often weary of blue cheese on a burger as it can easily overpower the flavor, but this cheese was subtle enough and tasty. The onions were also not too strong which is a good thing, the mushrooms on the other hand had more flavor and were really good. I don't think the prosciutto was actually present on my burger, but I had enough going on already. The pretzel bun was very soft and really quite tasty as well. Overall it was an elaborate but very good burger.

The Demi sauce was very good as well, but extremely overpowering so I only dipped in moderation as I was here to analyze the burger. Instead I used the sauce for a lot of my fries which were just ok, not great. Unfortunately this is becoming a trend in the fry department, and they really detracted from the overall meal. I wish chefs would pay more attention to the fries!!

The price was just about right as well; $13 for the burger with fries was very acceptable given the quality of the meat and overall complexity of the meal. I wish the fries were a little better, but this wasn't a bad deal even for a place far away from the strip. In no way was this the perfect burger, but if you live on the west side and want something a little bit different, check this one out.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,3,t99vtBUP4pnODaFti2fmcw
153054,2011-05-21,2,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"I noticed no one has written a review for ""The Martini"" (previously known as Martini's). However, since they are under new ownership I took it upon myself to devirginize them on Yelp.

First of all, it's been forever since my last review--I've been so busy (aka lazy LOL), but I honestly think the people who work here and run the place are terrific and I hope a favorable first review will inspire other people to try this place.

I often make my rounds at the smaller gaming bars/ restaurants near my house because:

1. I hate the traffic on the Strip
2. I prefer cozier places where I can actually have a conversation
3. The prices on the Strip are outrageous (yes a $20 martini is not just an urban legend)

My roommate and I had heard that one of our favorite bartenders Al who had formerly 'tended at the Sedona Restaurant moved here so we decided to give it a whirl. I had only been to the old Martini's once after pulling one of my all-nighters so I really didn't remember it well. Regardless, I was excited to try ""The Martini"" for the first time.

My first impression when entering the place is that it's elegantly laid out and immaculately clean. This goes without saying, but sometimes you go into a gaming restaurant/ bar and it feels dirty and ghetto and it goes downhill from there. This is not the case with The Martini--it's nice.

The staff here is GREAT and I've been here several times and have always had great service. The manager Nick is also great and he always thanks everyone for coming in. He seems to go out of his way to make sure everyone is comfortable regardless of age, race, or orientation--which I find highly respectable. I've also met several other industry people who work at restaurants / bars in the surrounding area, which is always a great sign that the place is good.

The Martini also has a extensive & diverse food menu that's way better than your typical bar food. In the 6 or 7 occasions I've been here since their reopening, I've tried several dishes and haven't been disappointed yet. I really enjoyed their cheese & salumi plate and they use a filet for their steak & egg breakfast, which i did find exceptionally good.

Of course they are known as ""The Martini"" so they have a wide selection of martinis & martini-esque drinks to choose from. I've tried the traditional and the Pom, which were both good and balanced. They also have a pretty good wine list to choose from, both by the glass and the bottle and several beers on tap.

The place is also a full gaming bar with several machines along the bar--I'm not a huge gambler so I can't really comment on the machines but I'm sure you'll find something to tickle your fancy if you're into gaming. 

Overall I really like The 'new' Martini and it's my new go-to place near my house. If you live in the area or are passing through, give it a try!",WfezMJ42_X_H-Dh_NYyjNg,13,3,4,PX8nkBdmjRd5xeJcXldk5w

My entree was the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.  I ordered it medium plus like I do at all steak houses(I know, this is not a steak house).  It came out charred in some parts of the top but yet still pink on the inside.  It was the most dry and chewy steak I ever ate.  I actually had to spit out my fifth bite because it was so bad.  I didn't touch the rest of it.  I then tried some of my wife's chef special(chicken parmesan).  She had stopped eating because she said it tasted like a Marie Callendar's tv dinner.  I had to concur.  The only reason I did not give 1 star is because the appetizers were good(spicy ahi tuna chips, and artichoke dip), as well as the desserts(crem brule, and tiramisu).  Needless to say, we will never be back here again.  I don't think it will be open much longer, we went on a saturday night and there were only two other couples there when we got there and only another table when we left.

455156,2015-02-01,5,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"We have been there a number of times.  I was attempting to try, at least once, every martini on the menu.  I must warn you that the martini menu has many drinks on it but only a few really are made well there.  I have gotten some really vile (as in too bitter to swallow) drinks.  So, stick with the really well known drinks, or you might be sorry.

The music they have is determined by the customer who chose songs on the jukebox in the corner.  You pay for and select songs to be queued up on the jukebox (this can be done from you smart phone).  However, if someone has more ""pull"" with the bartender than you do, does not like your music selection you will not be able to enjoy your selection since the volume will be reduced or shut off completely.  As the bartender explained to us regarding our selections: ""There is this women with a lot of money who does not like country music"".

We prefer to take our business where all the drinks are ""safe"" to be ordered and where if the music is truly customer selected the customer hears that selection and is not subject to the ""censoring"" of those who are considered too rich to disappoint.",ekUJsYFsrSsW7AkdwWnQ3Q,8,1,1,c6s86KwijlJQvsfqnOjIhA

The Martini is certainly a step up from the typical gaming bars.  Has beautiful decor and the bartenders can make a drink with more that two ingredients (something you will not find at an average gaming bar). The Pear-fection was delicious pear vodka and pear puree with rock candy syrup, and lemon twist, just the right amount of sweet and tart.  Pomtini made with pomegrante vodka and cranberry was delightful I could taste the anti-oxidants.  Food was excellent and a great value considering the quality.

He wasn't interested in small talk, staring blankly when I asked him how he was doing, and then screwed up my drink. Service was slow every time I needed another, and he basically had the chef run the food and forgot about me. The chef that night though, a white guy with a beanie, nailed the steak to perfection.

The restaurant side is very nice, quiet elegant for a bar. The service is really good. 
We started off with shrimp cocktail, it is not on the normal menu, but is for special occasions. Either I was super hot from the outside heat, or the shrimp cocktail ice cold but horseradishy sauce was soooo good. 
Side sald and caesar salad are well done, good fresh lettuce, light and crunchy croutons. Not the rock hard kind. Entrees were big. I got to taste the pork chop with mashed potatoes, really great bang for your buck. Had a wonderful grill char to it, and a very tasty sauce. 
The chicken scallopine was cooked nicely too. It had a cream sauce with artichoke, and mushrooms. The risotto was also a very nice touch. 
Dessert was amazing. We had fried oreo sundaes. The fried oreos brought me back to new orleans' cafe du monde's beignets. And then there was a warm oreo inside. It is a must try! 

I also saw a special for $15 filet mignon from mudnight to 8am, or all day sunday. I will definitely be back as the yelp reviews and photos look good.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,0,1,5,ce0sujGKP89qAurIl3edog

The wine pours were HUGE, especially for Happy Hour pours. 

The best part of The Martini is the ambiance. LOVED it! Dark, leather chairs, bar and tables (there's also a separate dining area but that was closed off for happy hour), and great music. This will be my new early happy hour spot. Definitely recommend!",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,7,2,4,MkULEnUrdmIXGTiO3k9Qyw

Never have tried anything off the menu but rumor has it  the food  is top notce.  She might not be able to see over the bar because she is only 4 foot nothing but she makes up in personality and she can pour a mean drink.  So you are my new favorite local bartender.

Nice spot, literally 5 people in the bar so we ordered drinks, bartender was friendly, etc etc. ordered 3 filet dinners medium rare which, after about 30 mins was delivered by the chef and bartender. Cut into it, well done!!! Immediately notify bartender and he offers to redo.  After awhile 15 mins or so, we had to ask for him to check on the order.  He did but never came back with an update...a few more minutes, we've now been there an hour and still NO medium rare filets?  Clearly no one else was eating apart from one person who came in after us who already had his food.  The bartender was chatting up the other couple across the bar. It was as though he forgot about us,and who knows what the chef was doing apart from making us wait and so we paid for our drinks and left.

Sounds- Some great 90's tracks playing at just the right level.

Smells -  Eau de Sour Bar.  Not strong enough to make you gag, but persistent enough to cause constant olfactory distress.

Selections- Limited Happy Hour cocktail specials- $5 Skyy Vodka drinks, $4 well drinks, $3 drafts.  Small but varied selection of appetizers in the $5 to $7 range. 

Service- Efficient and pleasant.

We had: 
A Skyy Raspberry Cosmo & a Stella. Shrug! 

The Ferrari-Carano Marinated Chicken Flat-bread with Caramelized Onions, Jack Cheese and Mushrooms.  Truly delicious and savory!

Isabell, Jamie, and So are always so friendly and make amazing drinks. The owner is frequently on site and takes pride in her bar. I love that it is a non-smoking bar during daytime hours and it never smells like smoke from the night before (they allow smoking at night). The menu is not your average bar food and there are lots of healthy options and the cooks have always been accommodating with my gluten sensitivity. They have a great happy hour from 3-7 I believe. 
If you enjoy gaming, then I would highly recommend this place because I feel they have the loosest machines locally and lots of free play awarded.

1500283,2015-12-14,1,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"Writing this review as a general overview of 3 total experiences here. 
Favorites are Grasshopper, Lemon Drop, Gimme S'more and Mocha Martini. 
Haven't been able to try their food menu though. 
The first time we went (day before Valentine's of 2015) was the time that won me and my boyfriend over, and we had just Yelped the place 'cause we wanted to leave a party earlier than expected. The bartender was nice, had a chill atmosphere and clean setting. 
Second time we went was for my birthday. Service was still awesome 'cause we were constantly checked up on at the lounge chairs by the main bar, and the server at the time was still attentive as we waited for my friends. The servers got me to try and I ended up liking The Blueberry which tasted like Fruity Pebbles. Still had the same good vibes as the first.
This last time wasn't as great of an experience though. Doesn't help to have high expectations because of previous experiences, plus it was our anniversary. Anyway... 
Server saw us seat ourselves in the lounge chairs we like going to, and gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted after greeting us. Didn't take us long to get the drinks, but I honestly don't believe her when she told me that my Chocolate Strawberry was subtle on the strawberry flavor. I kept drinking it in small sips to find the flavor, and I even had the boyfriend try it. There was also a 20-30 minute stint when we didn't see her, but wanted to order more. Boyfriend was trying to make things better by just going directly to the bar (literally a few feet in front of us), but as soon as he got there, the bartender walked off. Wha...? 
The original server tried making things better when she saw my boyfriend at the bar counter, but at that point, I honestly just wanted to call it a night. Hoping this was just a fluke experience.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,0,1,4,VWTKge23wApAHwgyo9g_6w

It had that upscale bar lounge look with the polished wood and classic bar in the middle of the room. TV's well situated. 

We had a charcuterie plate, we both had the chicken fettuccine alfredo with extra garlic bread. Spinach artichoke dip was like dipping chips into addiction because once you had it you will have wished you ordered an extra one as your meal.

The night we went the special of the day was a caramel apple-tini for five dollars. The cocktail was nicely balanced but lacked a noticeable caramel flavor. It was still smooth and well worth the price.

2257388,2014-08-25,1,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"This is a review of the food only.

Dropped by here today for Restaurant Week but also ordered off the happy hour menu.

Started with cocktail shrimp, which were decent size and pretty fresh. Then tomato soup... which I can't decide if I like it. There wasn't much flavor to it. The filet minion, which I asked for medium rare, but was more medium. A bit chewy but had a burnt taste to parts of it. Came with mashed potatoes and spinach. Overall the main course was alright.

From the happy hour menu, had the zuchinni fries, which had no flavor and were huge chunks. The server saw we didn't care for this and automatically removed this from the bill. Also had the truffle mac n cheese balls, which sounded awesome, but lacked flavor. There was no cheese flavor at all. No truffle flavor. Bland. And the ""sloppy joe"" sliders. How deceiving! It was a regular slider with cheese, and also lacked flavor, and had no sauce in it. 

Desserts were better. Fried oreos with ice cream... can't really go wrong with that. And NY cheesecake, not as dense as it usually is.. kinda fluffy which is nice.

Overall, food was all bland. BUT!! Our server, Heath was amazing. He was very nice, professional, and on top of everything. He deserves 5 stars. If I ever do go back, it would be because he is a good server.",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,1,1,2,wVPNXkhDqMzSoAz-Cr1F9A

2290416,2016-01-18,8,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"Say you want to watch two concurrent sporting events at the same time. You will have a very difficult time doing that here, as they have over a dozen TVs BUT each random cluster of 4 or 5 TVs are tied to the same channel, so during most busy sporting event days there is little to no chance that you will be able to request a specific game be shown other than the highly-subscribed, big-market NFL or NBA game that's currently on. They have a max of three (3) different programs on at any given time, which might suffice for a hotel bar in rural Minnesota, but certainly not for Las Vegas.

College gameday? Forget about it. There are so few available screen zones that often times all 3 games they're showing are on commercial.

Maybe it's because we don't drop big coin into The Martini's video poker like most of their customers do, but our request to watch a specific college basketball game during the recent Broncos-Steelers playoff game was shut down (with a surprisingly unempathetic attitude) by one of the bartenders who also never remembers we're regulars. So we didn't stay for what would have been something like our 60th+ visit to The Martini. Time to find a new neighborhood bar?

Upon walking in to the Martini you immediately realize that this is not your average Vegas neighborhood bar...it looks and feels too nice for that.  It is certainly aesthetically pleasing with a classy, warm feel.  They a lot of nice TVs here that make it a great spot to watch the game.  They also have an early Happy Hour with food and drink specials.  One of my favorite things is that the kitchen is open late, so you can head in to The Martini after 10pm when most other places have closed their kitchens and still order up some decent  food.  In general I would shell out 3 Stars for the bar & restaurant...but when you include these niche specialties it's and easy round-up for me.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,13,4,4,x2zlQuJTqF91tlSs_1I0OA

Tucked away in the back corner of an obscure strip mall, you have to know about this place and search for it. It's not exactly visible from the street, save for the signage by the road. But, once you find it you'll be pleasantly surprised by the lack of smoke, friendly service, and excellent happy hour deals.

We walked in and there weren't more than six other customers. Flautas ($6) come four per order. Well seasoned and tender shredded beef are wrapped in crispy, flakey fried shells and topped with tomatillo sauce and an avocado relish. The fried mac and cheese ($6) are three large meatball-sized spheres. The thick, course outer shell dominated the dish, with only a small amount of bland mac and cheese contained within. The dish was in desperate need of more roasted tomato sauce to give it more flavor. The lack of seasoning didn't stop there. The sliders ($7) would have benefitted from more sauce, too. At least the buns were buttery and light. 

While the food isn't outstanding, the happy hour deals of food ranging from $5 to $7 with $3 draft beer and $4 well drinks makes this a solid place to spend your late afternoon/early evening.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,1,3,65EEi5OC5WTKu6O5Qzss4Q

The 2nd time we went was to give it another try and as well because everyplace else was too busy. That time around it was bleh. We had no desire to return....HOWEVER, after reading recent reviews on Yelp and again wanting to avoid long waits on a Friday night we gave it one more chance. Glad we did!  The food had flavor this time around, was fresh, and good portions. And, the funky smell was gone too. I had the tomato bisque with mini grilled cheese and it was excellent!  Then, finished with the fish and chips which tasted fresh and the batter was nice and crunchy without the fish being overcooked. My daughter loves the 5 cheese Mac n Cheese and also the trail mix salad. The only complaint this time around was the waitress' lack of desire or even willingness to try to change the TV (of 3 in the less than crowded room) to the college football game playing on ESPN. instead, we had to strain our necks to watch the game on the furthest away TV and be stuck with ESPN News on front of us instead. She even told us she didn't want to ask the bartender to change the channel...because of her lack of effort on that front her tip was only 10% vs 20% which she would've gotten otherwise.

So we arrived last week around 4:30 and I kid you not we weren't greeted or even acknowledged for almost 20 minutes! That I found a bit odd because not only was there nobody there at the host station to greet people as they walk in but because it was happy hour we assumed to just seat ourselves and somebody would come over.. This is what normally happens at most bars right? Well after 20 minutes we were finally greeted by a nice young lady who Apologized for the wait because she was the only one that was working.. The apple martini was a hit! I got the please of trying almost 4 different drinks and that would would have to be the best! Skip the cosmopolitan for sure it was gross and tasted like cheap vodka that was used! The food was exceptionally good off the happy hour start menu! The calamari and martini burgers are excellent!

The food has always been great, like mom's recipes comfort style food, but when it comes to the service, I am extremely disappointed. And that is the reason that I will leave The Martini alone to the ""preferred customers"" that the bartenders make it a point to serve.

I am a quiet guest who came in with a friend one night to see the last inning of a baseball game. We each played $20 in the machines at first, and we ordered a Cosmo. To be honest, it was just shitty, but I am going to assume that the bartender assumed that we wanted comped drinks for gambling and accept it. I actually traded mine in for a vodka on the rocks.

Within the next hour, there was no customer service. Within the next hour, we played a total of $300. In order to get a drink, someone had to have been waved down, which was not the case with some of the other patrons around us.

We weren't loud, obnoxious, nor drunk. We weren't behaving in any way that deserved being ignored.

It's a shame, but I just won't return to a place that picks favorites before they try to get to know a customer. It wasn't worth my time nor money.",fRF4w7Oe-zDmyjDGFoSYJQ,4,1,1,mL5rAaue5LyBRZbsnTmPFA

Bartender is an attractive blonde woman, she was pretty attentive. Made sure to keep our drinks coming and refill our water. 

I ordered the calamari off the happy hour menu. It was ok. The breading was a little flaky, but calamari itself was good (not too chewy). The real winner was the Hot and Dirty martini. I thought it was a happy hour drink because the vodka used was Sky, but I was charged full price. If you are worried about happy hour pricing, make sure to ask in advance. My friend ordered the French Martini. I tried it and I wasn't that into it... but it's also not something I would normally order. It was a little strong for her. 

The bartender told us about the TV's and it looks like a nice place to watch football. This is pretty far from my house, but if I'm ever in the area I would definitely stop in for another martini or two.",Ad-v2Z4vvuzxZxbpywIm0A,8,5,4,0FQ_VkrZeR4nKJh269AjZg

Resisting the urge to indulge in a basket of deep fried delicacies, I chose the ""healthier"" route and ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with a side of of house fries instead of the optional sweet potato fries and house salad. The sandwich wasn't bad. It was just an ordinary fish sandwich with greens and cheese. If it wasn't for the wasabi cream, it would've been dull.

The drinks are cheap and range from $8-$14, depending on what you order. My dining companion ordered a martini called ""The Hummingbird"" for its Elderflower Liqueur. The drink was presented to her in what appeared to be a laboratory beaker. It was a little bubbly, and it had a pleasant and light sweetness. 

Our server was excellent. Granted, my friend and I were the only two people in their dining room, but she came by often to see how we were doing. She even encouraged us to return the following day to checkout a few Chippendales dancers who were going to be serving drinks to ladies. Not really my cup of Ovaltine, but that was nice of her to inform us.

A few coworkers and I met here after I suggested it from browsing good yelp reviews and everyone was very happy with the choice. 

We grabbed a couple chairs right next to the warm fireplace and our server Dante came over right away to greet us. 

Happy hour here is awesome! From 3-6pm you can find tons of cocktails and food specials including what we ordered which was $5 Apple and Strawberry Lemonade Martinis. The Apple one was deliciously tart and mildly sweet with a sugar rim and cherry. The lemonade one was a little on the sweet side for me but I guess thats to be expected. We also ordered the Mac and cheese balls and the zucchini fries. The Mac and cheese balls were ahhhhhmazing!! Four large bites of crunchy outside and cheesy inside! I could have eaten them all. The zucchini fries were large long battered fries served with garlic lemon aioli and homemade ranch. Another healthy portion of a not so healthy dish but a great bar food item!

3791520,2013-06-22,3,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"Late night visit tonight, courtesy of my roommate who was celebrating her birthday and picked the place, and now I remember why I stopped going here when management changed a ways back.... 

Look, there were some good parts. The food was decent, fresh, tasted nice and came out fast - nothing to rave about necessarily but I would (theoretically) go there and eat again. It's tasty, especially for a late night bite. Drinks selections are varied and interesting, but wine tastes a bit stale (like it's been open in the bottle in the fridge for way too long).

The big problem is that the service honks. For me, there's a thousand options in this town for food and drink, and many of them have quality offerings, so what really brings me back is service. And service here stinks - never worse than tonight. Sat down and waited nearly 10 minutes to be acknowledged and offered a drink. Actually, I had to ask for a drink. Had to ask for food. The only reason I had menus is because they were still sitting on the bar from whoever had them before. Let me say - the place was not busy. There were two guys behind the bar - one in uniform, one not. And if the one not in uniform was the owner, we're all screwed, because he was so disinterested in customer service this review won't mean diddly squat.

The inattentiveness and empty glasses sitting there for ages in desperate anticipation of  a refill were nasty enough, but the kicker was when the bartender miraculously stopped by to ask how we were (well over an hour  into being there and so irritated and exhausted flagging him down for service we were leaving anyways) and my friend responded with a question, and he, in all seriousness, looked at her, his eyes kind of glazed over, and then he just walked away as she was in mid-sentence. It was pretty much the rudest, most outright unbelievably inhospitable thing I've seen in any bar or restaurant in a long time. I'm not a big fan of people dissing my friends. This dude just did. not. care.

I'm in the industry, and I'd shoot myself in the face before a guest even had  a chance to complain if I ever behaved like that.

We didn't let it ruin our night - the service was so ludicrous and the snub so insane that we actually laughed our asses off. I still tipped over 20%, because our industry is all about karma and I can't help myself, but I'll never go back Martini's because their service sucks truffled macaroni and cheese balls. 

And worse for them - I'll be telling everyone else to avoid it too.",cB1pgndvG47P8XkeDa-7PQ,6,0,2,KN093CFODBNwQHiYV-pr5w

The service was terrible. 
My boyfriend and I get off after midnight, so we got there at about 2:30am. We sat down and after a few minutes the bartender came up and I said hi and he looked surprised, like he just noticed we were there. Then he said ""give me a few minutes."" Which sounded kind of rude. When he came back he asked us if we were gambling and got our drink order and after he brought our drink told us that it was a $60 minimum play for my martini and $40 for my boyfriends jack on the rocks. I haven't been anywhere ever that the rule has been more than $20 per drink so that surprised me and I don't understand why I need to play 3 times what my drink is worth at this one place. And the fact that he waited to tell me that until after he brought the drinks when he already knew we were going to gamble irks me. We were hungry so we stayed and got some food. We got the meat and cheese plate. That was good. Then we got the truffled Mac and cheese balls. We weren't impressed with those. And we got the ahi tuna sliders and those were AMAZING! 
We asked if we could smoke inside and the bartender said yeah as he was walking away. We didn't see any ash trays anywhere, he never brought us one and we didn't see anyone else smoking so I'm assuming he just wasn't listening. He kept saying he was Soooo busy but there were 10 other people at the bar other than us. I work in the service industry and 10 people at the bar is not enough to be failing this hard. Everything we asked for got ""ok it's gonna be a few minutes"" in response. What pissed me off about this is that we were here for an hour and before AND after we got our food the cook was standing in the bar area talking to people (he had also told us how they were REALLY busy) and the bartender (who never bothered to introduce himself to us, otherwise I would be mentioning him by name) did the same with people who were either regulars or his personal friends. He never came over to see if our food was ok. He only made my boyfriend another drink when he flagged him down. Took forever to bring us the check and forever to come back for our payment. I asked for $7 back and he came back and said he had given me ""exact change"" and it wasn't because he didn't give me any coin, so I kinda took that as my %15 tip not being good enough for him. 

I might get take out here but I won't be coming here for drinks or to dine in again. The bartender sucked. It was not too busy for him to give us good service. He was just too busy talking to care about us and didn't even deserve the %15 I gave him.",RwbQvEN2WoFOhMjLnIY3ug,3,0,3,ZFqUfYKLelX55J1iNweRqA

A great selection of beers, wines and cocktails and the servers are always friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately the last time we came here, we made the mistake of ordering food and this is why I have to give it 3 stars. We ordered a few of the appetisers as we prefer to go with small plates and try a bunch of different things. 
The flautas were nice but lacked flavour, fast food fries are better, the chicken wings were ok - nothing special, the Martini sliders were a little greasy although the blue cheese sauce was very good and the calamari is some of the worst I've ever eaten. It came so burnt and dry, it was difficult to chew and swallow, the bartender was very nice in reordering this for me and it was definitely cooked better the second time but still dry and chewy - the chefs clearly did the best they could with a lower than average product.
The food was so heavy and of pretty poor quality that both my partner and I had stomach aches and felt very uncomfortable with it all sitting on our stomachs hours later.
This is clearly a place that focuses on the drink revenue over food, either that or they don't try that hard with the appetisers.

3966540,2013-12-03,9,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"I was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  

The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.

I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.

For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.

My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  

As I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,22,17,4,ygh268ZfzfCu2CXyMTUQmA

The bartender was friendly and attentive, not sure how much the time of day had to do with that. He briefly explained the regular and happy hour menu. I ordered a chopped apple salad and a pizza margherita. I really enjoyed the salad, a mix of sweet, salty, and a bit of tart. It could have done with a bit less dressing though.

There are endless seating options with cozy tables by the fireplace, a huge bar with stools for gamers and non-gamers, and a separate dining area for a more intimate dining experience.  

If you want some real, tasty food in the late night hours, this is a winning spot.  I've sampled such items as the fish and chips, crab cakes, and chicken with risotto and been pleased with them all.  The menu is several notches above your average bar menu with treasures like shrimp scampi, mushroom flatbread, tomato bisque and salmon.  The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly and came with a delightful risotto and pleasantly crunchy vegetables such as zucchini and yellow squash.  The fish and chips really consists of 2 pieces of fish, 2 fried zucchini spears, 3 fried shrimp and a large portion of fries!  All of the items were cooked nicely in a flaky and crispy batter.  

The isn't a separate late night menu with limited options...you get the whole menu to choose from. Nice!

Upon entering, my first thought was that this place is like the other pubs but more sleek and definitely more sexy.  I also noticed a few people from Tivoli Village that migrated here after they closed.  It's like the party out here in Summerlin never ends.

As for me and my friend for the evening, we shared a plate of calamari and I had their Ahi Tuna Sliders.  Both were excellent and we ended the evening with a few drinks.

4232295,2013-02-24,0,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,"Happy Hour is awesome.  It's a little early, but when you're running errands and ready for a drink but it's not quite ""5 o'clock"", pop in!  They repeat it again at midnight for night-owls.

FOOD - we had the happy hour flautas (4 stars), calamari (2 stars), martini sliders (5 stars), sloppy sliders (4 stars), chicken/onion/mushroon flatbread (3 stars), wings (3 stars for hot, 4 stars for the thai peanut) and the mac & cheese balls (5 stars...LOVE mac & cheese!).  Portions were at least 3 of each...but more wings & flautas and the flatbread was big/meal-size.   I thought the prices were great.

DRINKS - there's no scam on limiting the draft beer that's on happy hour to PBR or Bud Light like you see at some places....they were all on happy hour!!  The martinis are filled to the brim full-size martini glasses and not watered down.  

SERVICE - attentive enough/no complaints.  plates were cleared in a timely manner, drinks were filled promptly, food came out sufficiently fast. 3.5 stars

ATMOSPHERE - I liked it.  The bar area is a large bar that circles the entire bar area around the bartender w/ some in-bar gaming, but not every seat so it's not a total gambling joint.  There are 3 fireplaces w/ club chairs in front of the fireplaces...very cozy for a party of 2-5.   There's a nook at the front corner of the bar that would seat a bigger group.  There are flat screens thoughout the bar so the sports fan is entertained.  And there's music from a video jukebox so  music playing in the background even if people aren't pumping in $.  It really has something for everyone.

We peeked at the dining area when we left around 6:45 p.m.--it was packed so it might be a good idea to make reservations if you plan on going on a fri or sat night. 

This was our first visit and I forgot to look at the regular menu, but we'll definitely be back for the happy hour.",FISzlNZgrFylvgX3Nl_a5w,3,0,5,QyYfLr_0uAei0sIpfppmxw

While their drinks are VERY good, the treatment of customers is not so good.  If you tip the bar staff with each drink, you get exceptional service, but if you withhold the tip until you pay your tab in full, they tend to treat you like an unwanted visitor.  Even going so far as to turn the music off when your selections come up.  We have been told they don't like Southerners or Texans. We did move here from the Boston area, but are FROM Texas/Georgia. Our accents and music preferences gave it away.  So if you are a Southerner, beware.

The waitress was very courteous and impressed us all by not writing down any of our orders. After the meeting a few of us stayed to talk further.

He had been here twice before while they were in Vegas in business and had a good experience. The food was excellent but the service was despicable. Our waiter started out good but then a table of about 8 young single women arrived and we lost his attention on numerous occasions. When one of the wives at our table jokingly told him he was guaranteed the better tip at our table he explained these were personal friends of his that we're moving out of state. So basically justifying his neglect to our table. We were the only two tables seated in the entire place. After and hour and a half and our meals still hadn't arrived I asked the bar to send the manager over. Finally and hour and forty-five minutes later we had our food and still no manager. Once our table was cleared and the waiter brought our check he assured us the manager would be by shortly but that she was in the kitchen cooking. We finally paid the bill and left, never having spoke with the manager. I'm typically pretty understanding of a venue being short staffed but for the manager to not feel any sense of urgency to at least come apologize is unacceptable.

So we sat down, the fireplace wasn't lit so we asked the server to light it, which she did and so began our culinary adventure. HAHA OK well it wasn't anything that fancy but it was nice. The chicken wings we got were tasty for the app, the salads were a little too dressing-ed out for my liking (next time I will be asking dressing on the side) but the drinks were super tasty! I ordered the burger, which was complicated as hell on paper but pretty darn tasty if you ask me (although I have had better but that doesn't matter it still was a good burger). My friend had the Fish n Chips and said he liked them, but by time our entrees had come out we were beyond stuffed! It was a little too much food but that's OK I'd rather have more food than not enough. We got our dessert to go, the Fluffer Nutter, which was OMG amazing at 3am which drunk!

The place was packed but we managed to find 3 seats at the bar.  The female bartender was awesome and on top of our service from being greeted to moving us across the bar where more space had become available. We had our 1st round of drinks and food service through her and everything was great. As her shift ended and graveyard had started, and that's where it went down. Michael Grimm had finished, guests were leaving and our female bartender had clocked out. It was us, about half the bar seated and 2 male bartenders. Even the owners had left. 

We had finished dinner and their happy hour had kicked in.  We studied the menu for our choices and we're ready to order..and waited...waited...and waited. We were on the corner of the bar and a bartender was talking to the couple 2 stools up from us. I had to get out of my chair, walk up to him an politely apologize for the interruption but ask for service. He immediately came over and apologized for his behavior and said he was completely rude but he was showing pics on his cell phone of a coworker in a accident who had survived. He kindly comped that round of drinks and the peace was made.

That round of drinks had finished...and waited...waited...and waited. Again completely ignored by him again and the other bartender. It was so bad that the sober male with us was slamming his hand against the bar for service to cash out. We paid, left 10% tip and I feel obligated to leave this long negative review. 

Martinis is a higher standard gaming bar. When you walk in, you know your paying more $$$ then the bar next door. The food is awesome (not typical bar food) drinks are great (pricey if not gambling) and wine list is fantastic.

I only ate there once before the closing and was not impressed.  I ate there last night and loved it.  Whatever the new owners have done is working (except my Arnold Palmer which was way too sweet.  They must have terrible lemonade).

1) Martini Sliders - some of the best sliders I've ever had.  High quality bun, a little blue cheese and caramelized onion, and thousand island dressing on the plate so you can put as much as you desire.  Meat was juicy with a nice seared crust on it.  Had that little bit of crispiness I like on a burger.  They seared it like a steak which is how it should be done.  Really just great.
2) Chicken wings - served nice and crispy with either ranch or blue cheese dressing.  I got it mild so it was a bit bland.  Next time I'll get it hot.  But it was really well cooked.  Chicken was moist inside and the outside was nice and crispy.

-the food is simply incredible, it is almost gourmet and the prices are definitely reasonable! My go to is the grilled cheese with tomato soup or any of their burgers!
-the drinks are phenomenal and they even have a low calorie section! My favorite is the xxx drink! 
-their best burger is the drunken burger on a pretzel bun and their chicken Alfredo is also super amazing!

I came for the late night midnight happy hour. We were out drinking so I didnt get to try any of the signature Martinis this time. 

Foodwise -

I got zucchini fries - it was standard but pretty good. I have a soft spot for spears vs chips of zucchini. It came with two sauces - ranch and a aioli. 

Sloppy Joe sliders - came with 3. These were actually really good!  Nothing at all like cafeteria mystery meat and full of flavor.  

Mac and cheese truffle balls- came with 3. It was just OK. The balls were crunchy and had truffle flavor but the tomato sauce was tangy and kinda cut the truffle. It was better when I didnt eat it with the sauce. 

Service was decent enough. We got our food rather fast and were checked on. 


Overall decent happy hour. Its nice inside and laid back so it would be a decent option for a date or a night out.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,1,4,1ItpjkxNSCI982Bl7aDLgQ

They have happy hour every day (conveniently), and their HH red wine isn't just one option! They actually have a Pinot Noir, $5 during happy hour, and I think it is delicious! Happy Hour snacks include $5 wings, and they don't skimp on the serving. As I mentioned in my first review, the atmosphere is leagues above your average video poker spot; it feels like the ultimate man cave. It isn't too smoky, and the bartenders are always happy to get the TVs tuned in to the game we want to watch.

Atmosphere = 8
Food = 7
Drinks = 4
Service = 1

The Mrs. and I love going out and finding new places to eat. Read good reviews about his place so we gave it a try.  

Atmosphere - When you first walk in, the look and feel are on point. It's upscale without being over the top. You can show up dressed or casual and feel comfortable. 

Food - variety of good bar food that is done up.  Normal items but with added chef like flair. 

Drinks - I order an old fashion and the fruit wasn't muddled.  You can call that fussy but it's part of the recipe which makes the flavor.  My wife ordered a Manhattan which was not made correctly. We did enjoy the Diesel which was cool.  I point this out cause they talk about their mixologist's on the web page.  They need more schooling for sure.  

Service - this can make or break an evening.  The bar was not slammed and the service was sooooo slow.  We were at a side table with a server and my wife got so tired of waiting she went to the bar to get a drink. The bartender was super slow to acknowledge her and then reluctant to make her the drink cause she was at a table.  Like gave her a hard time about it.  We paid for the drink at the bar just so she would make it.",InP2u2uiKtcCs4DpYxqcxw,5,0,2,AhNCgobXdAkq9DB7pF4hJw

I think they could do better. There are a lot of drinks to select from, which is a plus. The main reason I find myself going back to this bar is the fact that it's nonsmoking.

One of my favorite things about the bar was that it wasn't smokey like some other places I know and the music choice was chill. 

I'm a martini noob so I didn't really know what to order. I ended up getting the Green Tea ""low-cal"" martini drink. Overall, it was strong and had the perfect amount of sweetness. 

For food, we ordered the mild chicken wings (delicious; how can you mess up chicken wings?), truffled mac n cheese balls (perfectly crispy, cheesy and it didn't taste greasy like other ones I've tasted), prosciutto flat bread (plain; nothing special) and the drunken kobe burger (a tad bit too much blue cheese if you ask me). Overall,  portions were decent, food came out promptly and well presented.

The drinks are on point, and of extremely high quality.  The bartenders are awesome, they seem to be able to read their customers very well.  Sometimes I go in to just hang out to be one with my thoughts and they let me be, but if I'm in a talkative mood they read my mood and are there to shoot the breeze.   

The martini's here are the best that I've ever had.  My personal favorite is named the Vespar; made with Boodles Gin, Grey Goose, and Lillet Blanc.  They also make a S'mores martini that's insanely delicious, if you have a sweet tooth.  The Martini serves quality drinks that take craftsmanship, not like the junk at Blue Martini that just get the job done, which I'm not hating on because sometimes you just need a drink that gets the job done. 

The food here is unreal.  I've tried pretty much everything on the menu.  My favorite is the Chicken Scaloppini which is served with seasonal vegetables and risotto that's unbelievably good.  I also recommend the Fish & Chips which is more than just fish and fries.  It comes with beer battered zucchini and shrimp as well.  I don't recall the prices of these dishes, but they're very reasonably priced and comes with a lot of food.  

The quality of food for the price is second to none.  The drinks are great and also reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is way better than any other neighborhood gaming bar that I've been to .

It was a full meal with wine included, and I went on this full Kobe beef kick for my meal selection.  Wat that meant was Kobe beef sliders (so ridiculously good), and spaghetti with Kobe meatballs.  Everything was excellent, and between the Kobe taste explosion, and the accompanying salad, I was very much in a ""comfortable"" place.  The Pinot Noir that went with the meal only added to that particular zone.

I might have passed on dessert, but it was included in the package, and let me tell you: I'm glad I didn't pass.  I tried the ""Nutter Fluffer"": This peanut butter concoction with a batter fried shell, and marshmallow and chocolate dipping sauces.

Wow.

Talk about amazing.  It was ridiculously good, and I still periodically think about this dessert, which is unusual for me.  But if you eat here, this is the dessert choice to get.

Service was excellent.  Always there to make suggestions, check on the meal and anything that was needed, yet was totally unobtrusive.  This was coupled with this wonderful, intimate dining atmosphere that was just the perfect setting for a ""date night"".  The place just had a really cool vibe to it, which made for an excellent evening out.

I can see myself going back again, and hopefully soon.  I left feeling pleased (and very full) from the experience, and it's one that I will look forward to recreating.

Did I mention the sliders and calamari is part of their happy hour menu? Along with a great selection of drinks, $15 FILET mignon after midnight, and even more delicious menu items available 24 hrs. 
They have a great ambiance, that caters to a more upscale crowd. Which I find as a huge plus, especially while gaming there. You can play your keno, or poker in peace while enjoying great food and drinks without worrying about the same obnoxiously annoying people you see at most other gaming bars. 
My favorite bartenders are Amy, Albert, and Carlos! They know how to make great drinks, that are not too sweet which is why I consider them to be the perfect liquid chefs.

Service: both times I have been here both servers have been great. I believe my first time the servers name was Keith. I can be mistaken though. He was very nice and helpful. He went over the happy hour menu with me. And when my boyfriend came in he was sure to greet him also. We got there at 530 and happy hour was over at 6. Before the server closed our tab at 605 he made sure we didn't want anything else off that menu.
The second time we went it was Saturday night. I was expecting a very loud crowd but I guess we just missed them. This time we were served by heather. She's very nice and willing to talk with us like we are friends of hers. Which I loved. They had a dj because of a birthday party and also the owners birthday... Btw happy birthday to you nick. 
Now let's get to the drinks. 
I had a appletini. 3/4 were great. 1 tasted more like water. All depends on who's making it I guess though. 
My boyfriend had a beer this last time and he said it was very good and they know how to serve a beer since they frost their glasses. The only down fall was they don't have blue moon or shock top beer on draft. If they did this place would be a 5 all the way. 
The food: it was good. Normal bar food. Wish the wings were alittle more meatier but the taste is good. I'm happy they don't overdo the sauce on them.

This actually turned out to be a good option because Guinness was here having some type of Guinness Blonde launching thing.  Plusses:  Free Guinness Blonde, and hot looking Guinness Blondes.  Minuses:  Guinness employees who were entirely too loud right next to us.  But one of them gave us free beer so all is forgiven.

Our server was very nice and very patient with our group, who weren't exactly the model of efficiency when it came to ordering.  Thank you, server girl, for your kindness.  I like the dark-ish but modern décor, which does justice to the fancy exterior of the building.  There is a long bar to the right of entrance, along with tables and comfort seats along the left side.  To the left of that is a separate room of additional seating.  

Their happy hour deal is really good, with all their drafts being $3 and select appetizers for $6 (I think?).  We only had a couple of orders of taquitos, but it was very good.  I'd like to try some of their other menu next time, as well as their namesake, martinis, which I didn't try this time around.  One of my co-worker did have one and liked it.

It's overall a solid 4-star experience, and possibly more upon me sitting down for some variety in their offerings.

Table-for-1 Factor:  I think their bar is a pretty good spot for having a drink on your own.  Upscale without being pretentious, and looking appropriate for grabbing a drink and people watching.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,5,1,4,V8VF82dVTnqnsSogMraPzQ

Can't comment on the food yet but Apple Martinis were very good for the price and service was welcoming and friendly will be coming back in the future.",BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,3,1,4,0tWiphK5nUskI1GdLRJSLg

They make an Amazing pink cosmopolitan martini, I was really enjoying them throughout the evening.

This place is dark and cozy with a touch of class! The service is great with friendly staff who really complete your experience.

This is a great spot to meet up for a drink and just unwind from a long day of work or sex. 

I only wish I had been a visitor sooner as this is a nice spot that I have passed a kazillion times however never stopped in.

I will be back for happy hour for sure, with $5 Amazing strong cocktails how can you go wrong! Don't forget to try the pink cosmopolitan, you won't regret it I promise!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,11,1,4,YboWbxkG-i2SCDYHWwwMjw

I'm a bit of a wine snob and I thought their wine selection, although modest, was very high quality and reasonably priced.  We will be back!!  Also ask for Ray, he was a fantastic server!",JWVnz6f-EP3rGD345xY2bg,1,0,5,Tgq6QNFvI-GWeBkr6TvkuQ

5942859,2017-01-16,0,MwCai0x6GILtK4KkwufZig,I just went to the martin bar off the strip across the street from boca park and I had the best espresso martin I've ever had in my life. The drinks and food are good but the service is what's going to make me come back. If you want quality service at a off the strip prices come to The Martin and ask for mailani she is top tear. So if your looking for a good night out this is the place to be.,hy8fSNy4SOccUN1hF5LZRA,0,0,5,eF5GWAZnZhOKuH2yvpw0Og

I was pleaently surprised when my husband and I went for dinner The Martini and saw a wonderful artisian cheese platter on the menu.  Paired with a great bottel of wine and it soon became on of our favorite spots! Occasionally we'll even bring our children with us to happy hour where their friendly staff always brings the girls their favorite sliders.",7ztE2MxCps-RV1FGjnuZUA,1,0,5,GPEn7w3dyb_ihWCovQrJ-w
