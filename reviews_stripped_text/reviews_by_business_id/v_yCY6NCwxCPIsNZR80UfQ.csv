I tried the Sunday before last and missed out as I came too late, surprisingly 9:40 is too late even though they open at 8! This place is very popular. Unfortunately, you have to arrive super early to get a FT donut which they only serve on the weekends. I arrived last Saturday before the doors opened and it was well worth it! The donut was so soft and tasty, it went down smooth with the milk I ordered. I have to say it sucked sitting at the eating area as the air is blasting which made my French toast cool after a while. I only ordered the French Toast so I'm not sure about the rest of the donuts. I do plan on going back this weekend for another FT donut so maybe I'll try some others as well. The 4 stars is because I feel they should have the FT donut all week and because the hours they are open is so short, some days they close at noon.

Fritters... ""how can you mess up a fritter?"" well they do. Grocery store fritters are better. Every donut tastes like stale bread with a different design or flavored icing on it. People must love stale bread. The cinnamon rolls are dry and burnt, with or without bacon - don't let them fool you.

Walking into the shop you can smell the coffee and the donuts being freshly baked. The donuts are displayed behind a glass from almost top to bottom and all look amazing. There is a little sign that tells you all of the flavors - there are a lot! The service here is great and they answer all your questions for you and are also REALLY patient - since there are so many options it is definitely hard to choose just a few. 

- Creme Brulee Donut - THIS IS A MUST GET! The crack of the hard sugar shell and the custard on the inside all inside a soft donut.. yes, please. ($2) This is a little bit smaller than some of the other selections, but you do not need much since it is very sweet and rich.
- French Toast Donut - another favorite, light, airy, and the perfect balance between a donut & french toast. Also comes with syrup, butter, and jam ($5)
- Birthday Oreo - A birthday cake donut with an oreo inside - this is the same size as the creme brulee donut
- Caramel Latte Donut - This one is huge! The frosting is exactly like a caramel latte
- Big Poppa Tart Donut - ALSO HUGE! Looks just like a huge pop tart and has strawberry filling on the inside. 
- Burning S'more (or something to that name?) - looked fancy and tasted like a fancy s'more. If you like s'mores, you'll like this. 

Serve Stumptown coffee here and make great Americanos. All our donuts and our coffee cost about $28 (this includes tax and tip) and we got two of each of the creme brulee and birthday donuts. The smaller donuts are less expensive and the bigger more expensive, but totally worth the splurge (might as well on donuts instead of losing it gambling, right?)

The creme brûlée was weird. The burnt sugar didn't work for me with the donut. It was a little too thick and works much better when it's just over a custard. 

The Elvis had a peanut butter topping and a banana Bavarian cream center. Loved the peanut butter but hated the cream. It tasted like banana candy. Very artificial. I love banana and peanut butter, but real banana is better.

Stumbled upon ""happy hour"" and got a dozen of their donuts.  Was so hyped up due to the reviews.

Good ones: 
- Cream brulee: small and creamy
- Nutella overload: the nutella makes the donut
- Special of the day: Rasberry pistachio
- Good design on the donuts, huge portions

Not so good:do
- Butter beer
- Mud pie

MINUS one if not two star - the dough on almost every single one of their donuts are too dry and not soft/moist.  Example:  The butter beer donut was big and had great design, but when 85% of your dough is dry, you are left trying to eat the overly sweet cream to compensate.

I liked the shop a lot. Warm and inviting with lots of donuts on display and the staff was super friendly. I came all the way from the strip so I wasn't just gonna order a couple donuts, specially when everything looked so good. I ordered a dozen. 

The good donuts: homer, mexican chocolate, triple chocolate and big poppa tart. 
The not so good: old fashion, red velvet, s'mores and chocolate bar. 

As you can see they are good at making your typical donuts, but not so good at making cake donuts (which are my favorites). The old fashion donuts were really dry. Extremely disappointed by that since it's one I always enjoy. The red velvet and s'mores were also dry. Since I was paying a premium for each donut I was expecting high quality. 

However, the homer and mexican chocolate saved the trip. Those were HUGEEEE, really good, fresh, soft and delicious. If I ever go back those are the ones I would order again.

I've heard good things about the samoa Girl Scout style donut. I've had the creme brûlée... I wish it had more filling. Had to eat the whole donut before finding any filling until the last  bite. I am anticipating some flavors like the spiced chai for sure. I will definitely be back and you should swing by if you haven't yet. They close at 1pm and happy hour is just before.

Donut Bar is my usual go to stop for dessert after I take a visit to the ol' PublicUs. I heard a lot about the buzz going on, how it was considered to be the best donut place in the country, so on and so forth. I just had to check it out for myself, and for the most part, its awesome. Awesome-sauce even.

Donuts are a personal thing, everyone has different likes and expectations when they have a donut. Let me tell you mine. I'm a big fan of brioche-style donuts, ones you normally see on dessert menu's at high end restaurants. So that means I like a sturdier type of donut, one where the chewing experience is very important to me. There are some that like the lighter versions of donuts, where they sort of disappear after you start chewing on them. For myself, I'm not a big fan of those types of donuts. That's where Donut Bar comes in. It does remind me of those amazing brioche style textured donuts, with an incredible mouthfeel, and flavor that is on point. I do like the fillings and creams that they use, they are all balanced, without being too sweet, and they are full of bright, impactful, flavors. IMO, their yeasted donuts are the perfect donut.

The coffee here is outstanding. They use a Stumptown bean, and they offer drip coffee's as well as cold brew, all of it is on point. The service here is also outstanding, everyone is helpful and friendly, and they do a great job.

So you are probably wondering why this isn't a 5 star review. Well, I'll tell ya. While their yeast-raised donuts are 5 star all the way... their cake donuts to me are just OK. And trust me, I've tried my best to like them. I've ordered them on three separate occasions, and it just wouldn't click for me. It might be a texture thing, I like my cake donuts to have a slightly crisp, thin exterior, with a super soft interior. But oh well.

I'll be back, their yeasted donuts are one of my obsessions. Haven't had a fritter yet because they are usually sold out. But you just wait, I will find you, and I will have my day.

By the way, Best Music Playlist.. Ever.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,23,20,4,wH2JqxW02d8eUbbxbyJU5g

I first tried the Boston cream donut and while it was delicious, it tasted a little bit too fried. I'd get it again but I'd prefer if it weren't as oily. 

I tried mud pie next and I couldn't stop eating it, it was so good. It has a peanut butter drizzle on it, which I don't like too much, so I'd probably try something different next time but the donut part was so good and not too fried like the Boston cream. 

I'm obsessed with the look of the homer donut and will have to try it someday. FYI the menu is posted every day on their instagram!

Get there EARLY I've heard they have crazy lines. I went around 830 on a Monday and we were the only ones there. I'm sure the weekends are insane.",YLfrjibMp_HNKxmgO0wT4Q,2,1,4,PguRNml8oWESLNhlIy4IPw

I've enjoyed the Salted Caramel, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Blood Orange and Creme Brulee donuts, while the  Big Poppa Tart makes a good one to share, huge and stuffed with an actual Pop Tart and likely several days worth of sugar. I tried the Matcha on a recent visit and it was okay, small and not too sweet, but the Strawberry Split has my heart- fresh fruit, whipped cream, photogenic and shareable!

The Donut was fresh and fluffy like nothing I had tried before. The chocolate and marshmallows were perfect. The Maple Bacon Cinnamon Roll stole the show however.

It's a glamorous display of gluten-laden deep-fried sugar-coated creatively crafted creations that just don't seem to be fairly priced! Those babies should cost at least 50% more!

I empathize with the time demands and being a slave to crafting such treats, so it's cool to limit hours. Otherwise, they would sacrifice worker sanity, donut quality and artistic freedom to the confines of clock time.

Anyhow.... they have vegan donuts. I repeat, they have vegan donuts. Not the kind that you see and think, ""oh, those are the vegan ones."" Oh no, you wouldn't even care they are vegan or even know the difference, dear donut aficionados!

And for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, go Google the creme brûlée donut now and watch a video of it in action. It's just one those things where words won't do it justice. 

The thing about Donut Bar is that it is open until the store runs out of donuts. Therefore, I recommend getting there when it opens or going on a weekday. My friends and I got there on a Tuesday morning around 10am, and there wasn't a line. The best part was that there was a ton of creme brûlée donuts available!

We tried the pistachio lemon, maple bacon, strawberries & cream, and the creme brûlée donuts. Out of everything I tried, the creme brûlée is my favorite. The sugar coating is thick and tough, making it impossible to 'crack' with a plastic spoon. The cream filling inside is not too sweet and delicious. The other donuts are the cake kind, which is not my favorite. They're good -- a solid 4 where the creme brulee is a 4.5",rJtmzioJOpNCqV5mCMt34Q,3,2,4,KlNC7l11g7L8Dch-Vvt_Tg

We ordered the creme brûlée donut, as the girl working told us it is their best seller, as well as the maple bacon bar. 

Creme Brûlée Donut: Very good, except for the fact that it took four bites before we got any filling. We genuinely thought it was just dough with a sugar topping and were sooo disappointed, so when we finally got to the filling we were relieved! It was tasty, but I wish it had more filling in it, as the bites without it just weren't good. 

Maple Bacon: Super yummy! There was a ton of salty bacon on top, which balanced the sweet maple frosting well. 

I would definitely come back here, and next time I would order something more exciting. A lot of the specialty donuts are HUGE, which is what kept us from ordering them this time.",yTSqig9_dK80tzjgeWW08Q,0,0,4,wRXjTwfWzysGAH2ucgkS4w

The prices are crazy high for a single donut and I do not think you get a discount on a dozen.  I guess overpriced donuts are the current trend and people have no problem paying between $2 and $4 per donut.  I had a strawberry frosted donut at $3 and it was just okay and nothing special.

I think the Donut Bar opens a little late at 7:00 and misses the people that want to pickup donuts before going into the office.  I usually go to Real Donuts or Pink Box Donuts and both places are open very early.  I probably will not go back as I'm content with run of the mill donuts from the other places I listed above.

Walked in on Tuesday morning around 11:50 with a friend with the understanding that all the good donuts would be picked over. Wasn't wrong about that one, except that they had what both of us came in for. I was shocked to here that they did sell out 70% or something like that of the flavors... I saw plenty to choose from. The employee helping us was warm and was happy to help us with our selections. 

I chose the birthday cake donut with sprinkles because, duh. But also because it was of normal donut size. My second choice would have been the homer but I had errands to run and didn't want to leave the donut in my car in warm weather. My friend chose a chocolate donut. The big kind and he got through half. I ordered a glass of milk while he ordered a coffee. In regards to my donut, I wasn't blown away. It isn't the best I've had because I've had really great, moist donuts that taste extremely fresh, but there's no reason I wouldn't return to Donut Bar for more donuts. It's the first donut shop I've tried since I've been out here so my next couple visits will be in comparison to Donut Bar. I do appreciate the uniqueness they bring to something so classic, I was told they had donuts with a pop tart inside. I got cavities just thinking about it, but innovative concept to say the least. Attractive frosting and designs but traditional as far as donuts are concerned. 

It was a fabulous day out, a cool off after a hot couple of days. We were happy to find we could sit outside where there is a communal patio of the neighboring shops. It's clean and inviting, likely bustling in the warmer weather. I appreciated the art work on the buildings as well. 

I had intended to eat my donut and go back in to order a couple for others. To our surprise in 20 minutes 90% of their stock we walked into had vanished. No they had not put them away, they sold them! I was told they sell out daily! I think there's benefits to showing up fashionably late around the time they close (1p) - you get a bargain! Selection is sparse though at that point - you've been warned. 

Shout out to the bathroom - Homer Simpson, Family Guy art, loved it! Also loved the merch though I didn't purchase. Street parking is readily available around the block and you are in super close proximity to Fremont Experience for you tourists. 

I'll be heading back to try new flavors!",WOlBelW_IzsKOyizelNKCw,1,2,4,FCdPyTr5Cc5kFxdMClBKxA
1860096,2017-05-22,0,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"We used to go to this other donut place close to our house, but have stopped patronizing them because of their rude costumer service. Last Mother's Day, my hubby asked me where I wanted to go, and since I have been craving donuts and had the donut bar bookmarked for a while, I asked to go here. It was quite a bit of a drive considering we live in southwest, but we decided to go anyway. We got here around 12:30-1ish, and they only had a few selections left. Don't know if it was because it was Mother's Day, but the lady behind the counter informed us that because of the limited selection, we could get a box for $10 and fill it with as much donuts as we could fit. Although the creme brûlée donut was sold out and it was slim pickins, we were still able to get a decent amount of very yummy donuts. What would normally be a donut worth $3 a pop, we were able to get a full box for only $10! My favorite amongst our choices was the caramel latte donut. I thought it would have been too sweet, but it was actually just the right amount of sugar. Another favorite was the espresso donut, even though I'm not a big fan of the cake kind. We brought the box back to my in-laws house, and everyone was raving about the donuts. 

Fast forward to today-- My husband, son, and I had a hankering for donuts and braved the early Sunday morning drive to downtown. We got to the donut bar just a couple minutes shy of 8am and there was already a long line outside the door, waiting for the store to open. When 8am rolled around, the chef (?) opened the door and gleefully greeted the people waiting in line, and then proceeded to usher everyone in. We could smell the freshly made donuts before even stepping foot inside the store, which only fueled our hunger more. Upon stepping inside, it was such a different experience from when we went during Mother's Day. The cases were full of different flavored donuts, both fried and cake donuts alike. I truly felt like a kid in a candy store! The girl behind the counter offered our son a free inside-out themed donut, which I thought was really thoughtful-- they really cater to their customers at this place! Anyways, it was so hard for me to order since I wanted to try everything!!!! But we settled on the French toast donut (which was made to order ), a creme brûlée donut (obviously a crowd favorite), a Samoa, and a chocolate euphoria for my son. The French toast donut was good, different, and well worth a try. The cup of stumptown coffee they serve there went great with the donut. The Samoa was pretty good but, as I'm not a big fan of cake donut (my hubby is), I think I can pass on that next time. My son enjoyed his chocolate euphoria, and started picking on the chocolate shavings as soon as the donut arrived. Last but not the least, the star among the donuts we chose, the creme brûlée donut. It was quite small, but for only 2 bucks, it was a steal! My hubby did say that the caramelized sugar on top was a bit thick, but we both agreed that the donut was great and surprisingly not as sweet as we thought it would be. The creme brûlée filling was smooth and velvety, just how it should be, and accompanied the donut very well. I would honestly come back here just for another one of that donut, but I would be lying if I didn't say I want to try more. I might just have to make it mandatory that we go here every Sunday so we could try out a different donut each time. The strawberry shortcake donut they had looked mighty good, as well as the s'mores donut... I'm drooling just thinking about it XD

Although there are plenty other donut shops close to our house, the drive to downtown just to go to donut bar is well worth it. Not only are their donuts great, but all the associates we've had the chance to encounter were all so sweet, helpful, and personable. No wonder people keep flocking this place. Customer service is obviously a priority on their list, and there is nothing better than that... Aside from the donuts, of course lol.

1872611,2018-05-15,1,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"so reading the reviews for this shop, I was expecting some deliciousness, some extraordinary, some awesomeness and all I got was another ""wtf"" moment, and a feeling of ""should I call and complain and ask for my money back""...I mean, I dropped $25 for 8 donuts...ya let's get to the review...

so I found myself in the downtown area recently, and remember hearing about a donut that crunched on top, looked it up and was happy it was there. so I drove over to the spot in downtown, and checked it out.

walked into the shop, it's small, narrow, but it gets right to the point. the display of donuts was very nice. they all look delicious, and in my mind I was excited to finally try the assortment I was putting together. I went for 2 of the creme brulee donuts, one that I think had a velvet cake inside, one of the poptart donuts, a white sprinkle, and a chocolate top one and some others. total was $25 (price shock hits, it's donuts!!) but ok I paid it, drove home and dove in with wifey. this is where it just went wrong.

now, I usually don't take photos, but recently I have been of the meals and stuff I'm eating or places I'm going to, and this place got the picture...

every single donut we ate was dry. they were all over cooked I guess. the batter used had no flavor or sweetness. the flavors were not there, it was like trying to enjoy it but not...I only took a bite or 2 of each donut and trashed it. throughout the day just picked at them all. when I got the one that crunches, the creme brulee one, I was just SO let down. the taste was honestly gross. that mixture of the crunch on the top of your mouth, then mixing it with a soft/dry donut that has no flavor was just really gross. and I'm not picky, especially when it comes to what should have been sweet and delicious, was a major fail.

again, every donut was dry, and they all had no flavor or bland flavoring. even the pop tart donut was a bust. the cake mix they use is just no good. I don't know if it was that day or what, but no go for me.

now, I've tried pink box donuts which was ok. the only donut shop here in town that seems to be excellent every time is Winchells on Meadows Lane with the subway. that place is 5 star superb.

I understand though, this donut bar place, it made it on tv or whatever, and people want to see it, but all these 5 star reviews  is just not possible if it's consistently like my experience when quality comes in. check out my photos...you'll see what I mean.",Px6w_kTNBuy0GceThHnccw,2,0,1,8sBdN3hG7JWjBdVaNiTxyQ

So after our quick brunch at Bronze Cafe, we peeked over at Donut Bar and were shocked to be able to see the front door. It also gave us the chance to continue our tradition of donuts on road trips.

We walked in and perused the daily menu and made our way to the display case. The one that jumped out at me was the split donut stuffed with strawberries and whipped cream. My boyfriend stalks DB on Instagram and knew he wanted the Big Poppa Tart. I asked the sweet girl helping us out what the vegan options of the day were: apple fritter, creme brulee, chai latte cake donut, and yes, that strawberry cream beauty was in fact, a vegan soy-based whipped cream. The decision was easy for me because I'm not a big apple fan. One of each, minus the fritter. 

The creme brulee was of the yeast-risen variety. On top of the golden brown donut was a cap of hardened caramel that shattered at the first bite. Bite two yielded a rich ooze of vanilla bean-specked custard. The chai donut was exactly what I wanted. I'm a lover of cake donuts and this one did not disappoint. There was nothing ""vegan-tasting"" about it. It was just a great cake donut. The warm spices gave this a Fall feel and I was happy this was an option available in May. The strawberry cream donut was saved for last. I discarded the top because by the time I reached this, it was a little dry. The cream was dense, but still light and I couldn't believe it was dairy free. The strawberries were perfectly selected, juicy and sweet. 

I enjoyed the cake donut over the yeast-risen ones, but that's always been my preference. Still, I was very impressed by the vegan offerings. Street metered parking was easy to find because the location is in Old Vegas area.",92QbGGM9PAyqtW_WVlehiw,15,11,5,dTaeCAI6SD-DqxJzz3a2gQ

Pictures ""donut"" do this place justice as many of the donuts looked like they were on steroids, they were huge! Those ones seemed to be more of the plain variety though whereas the specialty donuts were of the smaller size. They have lots of yummy flavors and I couldn't decide what to get. Luckily the employees were patient while I waited to make my selections. I finally chose: 

Strawberry big poppa tart
Creme brulee 
Blueberry cheesecake 
Maple bacon
My dining companion got the french toast donut and holy crap that was delicious. I should have gotten that. 

I thought they were all pretty good. The blueberry cheesecake had a yummy blueberry filling, but I didnt find the flavor to be very cheesecakey. The creme brulee was a fun one. It had a hard caramelized sugar coating on top of it that was totally reminiscent of real creme brulee. I had a couple bites and the inside was a sweet vanilla cream. I brought the other half home to my brother who said he almost broke a tooth on the hard shell, so watch out! The maple bacon was probably my favorite. It was a maple bar with real chunks of bacon on top. The salty/sweet combo never gets old and was a delight to my taste buds. The big poppa tart was really just like an oversized poptart. I thought it was fun, but was honestly my least fave. For 4 donuts it was $12, I dont think that is very unreasonable for what you are getting. I can see myself coming back here for sure.

Pro Tip- If you follow them on IG @donutbar, you can check out their daily menu. They post it the night before so you know what to expect the following day.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,4,3,HdbY7cE1bsi3owoOQzldGw

2087258,2018-06-02,0,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"As a donut lover, I researched the best donut places in Las Vegas before flying in for my first trip. According to reviews and social media this seemed to be the place to go.

My friends and I woke up early on a Sunday morning and took an Uber to the bakery. When we got there it wasn't crowded at all and we spent time looking over the menu trying to decide what we wanted. Thanks to the pictures I saw on Instagram, the French Toast donut and Strawberry Split donut seemed to be must haves. Along with those I got a vanilla bean glazed, a Nutella filled and a cheesecake filled donut. Go hard or go home right?

The strawberry split was my favorite hands down and I'd go back for that alone. The French toast was made to order and served hot with syrup, jam and butter. Easily a second favorite. The other 3 were okay and kinda let me down. The nutella and cheesecake filled were both good but did NOT have enough filling...I felt like I bit through 3/4 of the doughnut before I tasted filling. The vanilla bean glaze was also okay. However, there are so many delicious looking donuts available that I'd definitely go back to try something new along with my favorites.

Props to Donut Bar for having a back patio where you can sit and enjoy all your donuts. The morning we went there was plenty of seating available. If you love donuts like me, definitely make this a stop on your next trip to Vegas.",908SuFtH9q-vS8kGfRBDjQ,2,0,4,8qLwfWPiK4Mm0kz8SvW2JQ

We had 2 options: BOGO or one box for $10. The box deal was so much more worth it so we ended up getting 16 donuts for $10!!! WHAT A STEAL. Plus if you check in on Yelp you can get either a free Americano or drip coffee. #win

Blueberry Lemon - Just okay, but I liked how it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be.

Strawberry Split - Meh. I wouldn't get this again. The donut was just cinnamon and dry (probably because it had been sitting out all day) and the whipped cream inside was dry and tasted like it came from a can. The strawberries were also very plain and it would've been better if they were glazed.

Crème Brulee - My favorite out of everything I tried. The crunchy glaze on top was cool, and I love filled donuts. After eating half though, the cream inside started tasting artificial like cheap cake frosting so I had to come back to it.

Buttermilk Bar - I really liked the consistency of this! Moist and cake-like on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside.

The other donuts look bomb so I'm definitely going to come try some other flavors. I agree that I've had better donuts elsewhere, but this location just opened 3 months ago so maybe their quality will go up. Street parking was easy to find.",AYGH5HXSHdfOei0y_XdcTg,12,10,4,HdAsnYkvIE_7eJazoLPGng

My bf got a s'mores donut, which was a big fail. It tasted like a less sweet version of something dunkin donuts (a favorite of mine) would try to make. At $3, and a quarter of the size of my donut, I didn't think it was worth it.

You're immediately greeted by the sight of colorful mouth-watering donuts that line up the glass displays. Just be mindful that this place closes by 1pm so plan accordingly!

I tasted the Creme Brulee donut and the Snickers donut. The Creme Brulee donut was a bit smaller compared to all the other donuts but that shouldn't shy you away from experiencing creme brulee in this doughy goodness. What makes the donut so great is the experience of cracking that shell. The sweet creme oozes out and that first bite takes you away to some far off French patisserie. It's a donut you won't find anywhere else and is a must try if you're going! The snickers donut is good for two if you're not looking to start your day on the heavy side. I enjoyed the snickers pieces on the donut but other than that it wasn't amazing. 

If you're looking to try something new off the strip I say stop in and grab a donut. They have a huge selection but they only make a certain batch of each donut.

Went for lunch with a co-worker after seeing a photo of a donut from this place on unlokt. Apparently, it used to be O Face Donuts and looks the same inside. I never visited when it was O Face but I'm glad I did visit this time!

I went with the ginormous blueberry donut and it was delish! Co-worker went with the one stuffed with the Oreo cookie. I tried both and I think the Oreo stuffed one was a little better but any donut the size of the one I got gets bonus points for 'more to love.' 

The guy who helped us was super friendly and told us we had to stop back in the morning to see their full display of goodies. By lunch time, they have a smaller selection remaining but I still felt like the 10-12 left were plenty to choose from. Also, at this time of day it was buy one, get one. I love a discount so that was huge for me. 

Next time, I'll try the one with the pop tart inside. I punked out this visit because I was trying to eat slightly less than a zillion calories of possible but next time I'm going for the gusto! 

Final thought: my donut was a little dry but the icing was great. As of my first visit, they didn't steal my heart for best donut in town. But I'm definitely going to give them another shot.

It was nice to know that this time around, an hour before it closed, they still had tons of choices still. This time I was smart to call first before heading there because downtown can be a pain in the butt. The first time I went was disappointing because an hour before closing, everything was already sold out. And that was the time I had a friend in town as well. But this time around, I wasn't disappointed about the options per say, but actually the taste tbh. There was a deal going on that they sometimes do on the last hour of opening and they either do buy one get one, or fill a whole box of donuts for $10. Of course we ordered the famous creme brûlée, strawberry cream cheese and the pumpkin spice. I was too juiced to crack open the creme brûlée. As far as taste, it wasn't that great. It was very sweet. Too sweet. The hard top of the creme brûlée was nice and crunchy but overal it was OK. at least the donut itself was soft. The donut on the strawberry was weak. I could make it at home. The pumpkin spice was the tastiest. The filling was good too. Next time I need to try the ice cream donut cone when it gets warme",YMG37osXwAL7pphRCZReYQ,0,0,4,BjznbGyJqq4Qm8p3OIlCxA

I am just about positive am the last yelper that I know in Vegas that finally checked out Donut Bar. I noticed recently Donut Bar has started to open maybe once month or random times at night. So was like NICE finally get to try the pop tart and the creme brûlée. All the videos seen of the creme brûlée and one of the stables pop tart looked delicious. I do love my donuts from time to time. 

I heard that generally there a line when first open and the earlier get here the better. The later you come not really the best idea cause they make only so much donuts everyday and by the end slim pickings (truth nothing worst then stale donut). I got down little earlier because not sure where the place was and parking downtown flat out sucks. Honest if you park near Donut Bar they have self pay parking meters. If ur lucky depending time of day its SUPER easy and cost is cheaper then paying any hotel or parking structure. Dollar on the meter gives you hour. More then enough time (maybe if the line is long then that another story). I was surprise but the line was not that bad only four people ahead of me. Just the fact there was LINE for donut shop still blows my mind. Donut Bar does carry strong name brand. 

Chef Jeff is not only a passionate owner. The guy knows his donuts and all positive vibes. The minute he open the door greeting all five or six of us come on in. Friendly, all smiles, and love the atmosphere. The smell was awesome minute walked in!!! Fresh batch of donuts, the display case truly gives the donuts even more eye candy, the diversity crazy (oversize homer donut, rectangle pop tart, small circle creme brûlée, traditional size ones but nothing traditional with the flavors or colors, and untraditional ones with donut cones fill with ice cream or strawberry split), and it long line of donut goodies. You might forget the selection at the top of the line. The place is small so gets filled up fast if want sit down. It located literally next to Carson Kitchen or look for the famous Donut Bar sign outside. 

The stumpton cold crew deserves shout out. I never had that brand before. I decided try the coconut flavor cold brew in carton. It was perfect compliment go with the donuts. They have other flavors. I believe one was chocolate and the other not sure. They also offer it on tap if you like. 

The donuts the pop tart is HUGE. If one person can eat one that pretty good. The way pop tart melting into the donut not sure if tasted any of the crust associate with pop tart. The filling you know if fan of pop tart is true and true. The icing and the goodies on top just pushed it sugar overload. I loved it. The creme brûlée was good. I think that one better eat it on the spot cause the longer it sits the crack on top break it apart. Rock solid. I had fill out my box was got strawberry split. The strawberries was fresh, juicy, and I keep thinking strawberry shortcake.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,7,7,4,8Tg08OZR2PG3TSr4mYik6w

We ordered the Homer. (My other half is a The Simpsons superfan.) And the Snickers donut. 

The Homer was delicious, soft, moist and really. Yeah. I'll say it. A happy party in my mouth. I would eat it again and again! That was a very well made and thought out donut. Brightly colored, cute sprinkles. Large in size. Easily a donut for two. 

The Snickers donut was a bit of a disappointment. It was dry and lacking. The dough didn't seem like it held up as well, possibly because it was chocolate? It was quite unsatisfying. In fact, it went unfinished.",9kldnKWlnNZTh17EFbzESQ,1,0,3,WYVyU_f2cdE-xWDl0zHr7g

We purchased the creme brulee, red velvet, and blueberry cheesecake donuts. I think what is special about this place is the different types/styles of donuts. I thought the donut fishtank was cute too!!  I also liked the ""barstyle"" set up (bar table/stools) they have there. The one in San Diego serves beer so I think as this Vegas location grows they should serve different items to stay competitive. The hours are from 8-1 pm on the weekdays and 8-12 on the weekends because it is said they sell out of all of the donuts by those times, however, there were many donuts available around 11:30 am last Sunday when we were there, so I don't understand that statement.

Normally at the one in SD you can expect a line of 20+ people waiting before they open. Maybe we caught them at just the right time since we noticed more people start to show up as we were leaving.

The place is a bit smaller, and it seems like the selection may be smaller too. I also noticed that they don't give kids free doughnuts like they do at the one in SD. The staff were just as friendly and welcoming though, and we were not disappointed with the doughnuts we picked, just as delicious!

Friendly customer service. They have a coffee/espresso bar as well. The Sumpton coconut cold brew sold by the single serve carton was really good. Not too sweet with a hint of coconut.

Notes for the donuts I tasted this time: 

db Nutella - didn't really taste like Nutella, more like milk chocolate with crushed almonds on top. Really large size, frosting was borderline too thin for the size of the donut. The donut part had good flavor and texture on it's own, which is always a good sign. 

Creme brûlée - smallest in size, but I appreciated that. Really enjoyed the crunchy sugar crust. The cream was also the perfect sweetness. My favorite of the bunch. 

Butter beer - larger size. I was expecting a pronounced butterscotch flavor, but didn't even get a hint. The Harry Potter theme was cute. 

Lemon pistachio - larger size. Hey, this one actually tastes like lemon and pistachio! Good balance of sweetness with the lemon.

S'mores on fire - standard ""normal"" size. The most aesthetically pleasing. The only cake donut of the dozen. Didn't care for the actual donut part which was a little dry and lacking chocolate flavor. The marshmallow on top was good; probably made in-house? 

Maple bacon - bar shape, normal sized. I'm a fan of the whole salty/ sweet thing, but this was just ok.

Caramel latte - larger size. Had good caramel flavor, but didn't detect any coffee at all.

I feel like the names of the donuts set up certain expectations, but when the flavors weren't there, it was disappointing. I am willing to give them another shot though, since I did enjoy the creme brûlée.",vBmh71e1szXipEBrS1R3RA,1,1,3,vVmIf5mZo6AlvD324f6J5w

I walked in and was so happy to see the Strawberry Split!  It was huge!  My husband got the Expresso Chocolate and my chocoholic friend went for the Triple Chocolate Threat after being disappointed that they didn't have the Chocolate Euphoria today.  Theirs were both cake donuts and we felt they weren't anything too special.  My friend commented the Chocolate Threat was not even Chocolatey enough and I agree.  I came here for the Strawberry and I was not disappointed.  The donut is bit crusty like a croissant.  I would prefer like a soft donut but my husband and friend enjoyed the ""crust"" the way it was.  My husband also commented that it reminded him of a Chinese birthday cake.

Each time I have gone in I have been greeted by a patient and professional staff member.  When I say patient, I am referring to the fact it is extremely difficult to decide what to get. 

Since the last time I was there, they have made what seem to be ""giant"" donuts.  Believe me I wanted the giant blood red orange donut!  However, I picked the strawberry cheese cake and a creme brulee.  I really liked the strawberry cheesecake donut even though I thought it should be called a strawberry filled donut more than anything.  The creme brulee donut had outstanding filling!  It was a delicious decadence.  I wasn't into the top of the donut but I haven't had much exposure to creme brulee.  

Just to mention, I have also had their vegan donuts and loved them as well.  I had the vegan donut when I had company in town and bought a dozen for everyone.  It was a bit of sticker shock when the dozen cost me $23 but when you eat the donuts you understand you are getting ""every penny's worth."" 

Overall, I would have to say these donuts taste as if they were cooked with care and pride in craftsmanship. They are worth the drive when you have a donut craving that won't go away and demands gourmet taste.",kn4lbh5vEsqeo5SbHWS_HA,0,0,5,13Z-kCzIBkHvnvR05OBWQQ

I guess living In LA for the past four years really spoiled me because of the myriad of donut shops I've tried there. Donut bar is different from all the donut shops in Vegas I do have to say. They offer donuts the size of your face, flavor combinations that are unique, and esthetics so pretty you don't want to eat them. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the texture. The texture was not as moist as I had anticipated. With every bite, I had to wash it down with some water. We came at noon and maybe the donuts were sitting there for a couple hours? But that should not be a valid excuse for a shop specializing in donuts. They close at 1pm or when all the donuts are sold out. Would I come here again, probably not.

I was getting donuts for a few people so picked a good variety: Caramelized Pineapple, Caramel Latte, Cake Batter, Mud Pie, Red Velvet, Samoa, Chocolate Twix, Blueberry Cheesecake, Banana Caramel and Apple Fritter.  Half went to work with Hubby and half came home with me.  It is hard to pick a favorite but if pressed I would say the Caramel Latte and Samoa were the faves out of the ones I tried.  

They post the next days flavors the night before on social media.  Check it out before you go so you have an idea of what you want.  They are listed in store too but the line moves quick so be ready.  Not all of the varieties fit on the counter so don't miss a flavor because you didn't read the list.

Pros: fantastic service - staff were friendly and 
 knowledgeable
Cute shop - set up/ decor
Ginormous donuts and vegan choices
Free Jiggly puff donut for my son
Vegan apple fritter was yummy

Cons: Aside from the apple fritter the donuts were just ok. For the elaborate toppings the actual donuts were alright, nothing special.
Price varies per donut...I paid $18 for 6 donuts ( vegan: 2 creme brulee, 1 strawberry split, 1 apple fritter, 1 cake batter, 1 chocolate euphoria, and a free Jigglypuff donut)

I was actually looking for a churro place but I guess this place popped up for their cone dipped in cinnamon sugar. Even more excited that the shuttle got lost and dropped us around the corner from Donut Bar!! So why 3 stars? Let me break it down:

Ambience: 5/5. No complaints. Not the strip, and not a glamorous neighborhood, but inside is cute, the donuts all look amazing. Clean, etc. The board and menu is cute as well. 

Service: 5/5. The girl who helped us out was patient. It was kind of hard being a short Asian to try to see the donuts displayed in the back and not in the counter. She was super friendly, cheery, and overall nice. Service was quick.

Layout: Definitely up with the social media trends with the hashtags and the sign so you can instagram those ginormous and beautiful looking donuts. 

But the most important part is the donut itself..... 
Donut/Pastries: 2.5/5. The donuts LOOK amazing. So much variety. Different sizes. Awesome flavor combinations. I bought 6 donuts. A whole box for $16. BUT the donut itself was so disappointing. The batter was dry and thick. Closer to an old-fashioned when it wasnt supposed to be. We got there right when they opened at 8am so its not stale. Its just the batter itself. All the donuts had the same batter so even if the frosting was different, the dry batter was still the same. 

Creme brulee donut was one of the top ones according to yelp and the girl, but even though the filling (amount was also inconsistent since I bought two), it still didnt moisten the dry batter. However, the crunch of breaking it was satisfying. 

The maple cinnamon which I figured was the closest to a churro was burnt near the top and edges but gooey in the middle. However it was too sweet. Perhaps it was the maple. I still ate 90%. 

I really wanted to like this place but their actual donuts were all disappointing. Could not use the #bestdonutsintheworld. Sorry!

P.s. Apparently, the cone only is available after 10am. So I never even got what I came for. The rating is purely on the 

3.5 stars rounded down to 3 as I do not think its overhyped for the donut itself. Everything was good though. Come for the novelty and not for the best donut in your life.",w-US6FCjLJvqTiRsnQz89w,2,0,3,ujAdLswYwAlLfHKRStr4lw

A co-worker brought a bunch into the office. There were literally so much to choose from. Green tea, crème brulee, strawberry shortcake, pop tarts in different flavors, blueberry cheesecake, maple bacon, pumpkin spice, cookies n cream, birthday cake oreo and a few others.

Some tasted better than others. Donuts tasted fresh and the cake wasn't dried. I had half of the green tea one. No green tea taste to it at all. In fact, it tasted more like a lemon flavored donut with green colored frosting on top. The strawberry shortcake and blueberry cheesecake however, was FABULOUS!!!!!! It really taste like it sounds.

Came in on a Saturday morning around 11am to find a small line of about 5 people formed waiting to place their orders.  Donuts are priced individually.  Picked up two nutella overloads, one strawberry cheesecake and one toasted coconut; total came to $13.  
Nutella Overload:
Nothing to call home about.  In my opinion, there was no 'overload' of nutella present.  This donut is basically a nutella-filled donut with powdered sugar dusted heavily on top.  
Strawberry Cheesecake:
This is a jelly filled donut (I believe strawberry jelly - hence the strawberry in the name), with a glazed topping and a dusting pile of what I believe is graham crackers.  I don't get any cheesecake from this donut, so I don't know why they find the need to call it a strawberry cheesecake donut.
Toasted Coconut:
An old fashion cake donut with toasted coconut on top. If you like coconut, you will enjoy the coconut topping.
Overall, these donut were not terrible but they were not donuts that I 'gotta have' next time in Vegas.  
Side note - there is metered parking right in front of the business which only takes credit cards.  Best bet, have someone drop you off and circle around and pick you up to save money on parking!",UggZGnlXE4Tm8fPE8uld5Q,1,0,3,Zq3WeuzBlq5OnvQC0v8iug

My husband tried an Apple fritter which he loved so much that he texted me while at work to let me know he loved it. I have a nutella donut saved for tomorrow's breakfast and can't wait!!

The first time I went there, they had a special on birthday cake donuts.  I told them I wanted one of those, and one of the Homer Simpson inspired donuts.  The server placed two birthday cake donuts in my box, instead of one, as a special treat as it was opening week, along with the Homer donut.  When I told her it was also my birthday and that it was really cool, she put another donut in there!   I've been back several times, and still haven't gotten any other free donuts; however, let me just say, I've encountered the same friendly service!

Consider trying the chocolate milk or coffee on tap, and be sure to use the restroom, well, at least look in the restroom before leaving.

I came here the morning after a night of drinking and what a good idea that was. My comrade and I picked up three donuts to sop up what was left of our Fat Tuesday drinks marinating in our digestive tracts. 

We picked up two giant donuts (one birthday cake and the other nutella) and one regular sized (strawberry shortcake). For me, the star was the strawberry shortcake. It's like one of those ice cream bars you'd eat as a kid (who am I kidding? I eat them as an adult too) but in donut form.  It's the cake donut type but it's all pinkish due to the strawberries in the donut. Yes. PLEASE. 

The larger donuts we got were the yeast type donuts. Both tasted the same except for the toppings. One was topped with frosting and sprinkles (that tastes like the canned frosting, yum) and the other nutella. Both delicious and easy to share between three people. 

I'm already yearning for these when I come back.",J7yrodx4X_ptycfYf7DsMA,2,4,4,tfdMQ7iuiyNP4N8T-1Y0ig

The staff is friendly and energized which is great for the downtown area. The drinks look amazing but I decided to get a simple strawberry milk and chocolate milk, which complemented the donuts even more. I'll definitely be coming back here. 

Some tips I'd recommend 
- Get there early preferably in the morning because they do sell till they run out of donuts.
- If its a nice day I'd recommend eating outside in the back because it has a nice feel to it. 
- Always get a drink even if its just milk!",GKX18GCxu5OxgFgFn2QjoQ,0,0,5,e1h_ectH8xyePCdccZKIMA

I didn't expect to buy leftover donuts but they were a great deal at the moment so we decided to fill the box up with $10. Half of the box were all creme brûlée, the rest were weird unwanted assorted donuts. The donuts were cold, chewy and unappetizing. Maybe it was because we came late... I wasn't very happy but for the price, it was $1 per donut approximately. None of the donuts were that good, just taste like a regular mom and pop kind of place. 

I also got a Nitro infused coffee because the guy recommended me as something new to try. Pricey and wasn't worth it. The coffee was SOUR! I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste that way... I mean if you really put your mind to it, you might find it drinkable. I'm a huge coffee lover and it hardly got me to finish half after an hour of walking around downtown. 

BUT we will be back, earlier for fresher, warm, assorted donuts instead of leftovers! This place got potential and I will update the review with my next visit.",pIekRRbcZvQbwYobu7f6sA,0,0,3,-pfSEzGmS4q7gc-sTdafNw

I have been looking forward to trying this place since it's opening and two times made the journey downtown from the west side of town to see a sold out sign.  This third time we came on a Monday a little past 10am and it was open.  First off location for me is not convenient so I really was expecting something mind blowing. Bummer that it wasn't the case.  I did appreciate the different variety of choices.  I went for Reese's peanut butter cup since chocolate cake donuts are my favorite and the pop tart donut.  The topping on the Reese's donut was great but the cake donut itself was blah.  This opinion from the girl who thinks pink box chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and coco Krispy on top is crack!  The donut didn't have much flavor   Kinda felt like is was just eating a Reese's peanut butter cup. The pop tart donut gave me a little more satisfying feeling but the inconsistency between the edges and the middle was a let down.  Wish the jelly filling was spread more evenly throughout rather than a bit splatter in the middle. In the end I'm very sorry to say I threw them away after a few bites each.  Anyone who knows how much I love donuts know that's shocking!  If I'm in the neighborhood I would give it one more try and try a few different types but definitely will not go out of my way again when pink box, Dunkin' Donuts and Winchells are within 2 miles from me.",hJqBNS5Tdo9Du-s3DDpMqw,5,3,3,roxnNYeDvr-W5X8p9u_vcA

2860551,2017-02-22,12,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Easiest 5 stars EVER. 

First of all it's donuts so thats an easy 4 stars just for existing. The location is a bit tucked away which adds to the mystique of this dynamic donut experience. If you're staying in the downtown area and you have a free morning forget cheap steak and eggs. Bloody Mary's can wait... and a breakfast buffet is usually disgusting. These gourmet donuts will change the way you look at this breakfast novelty forever.

Anything with bacon comes with REAL bacon. Not those stingy little crumbles at other places. This bacon was thick cut, maple cured, and had a crunch that sticks to your jaws. EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR POPPED! The glazes are delicious and leave you with an angel like after taste. 

I suggest looking at the pictures. Try not to drop your phone with amazement. Yes the presentation is an important part of a business like this. The passerbys or window shoppers will NEVER be disappointed walking into this business. These oversized breakfast treats are worth every penny. 

Here's a few suggestions
- Creme Brulee ( it cracks when you bite into it)
- Brad Fritter ( its an apple fritter covered in caramel drizzle and a mountain of THICK cut bacon)
- The Homer ( its a giant donut just like the one from the Simpson's)
- Chai Latte ( it was like sipping on a cloud)

5th star factor for me was easily the mountain of bacon I received on top of my donut. It was definitely more then the 2 strips of loneliness you get at a Denny's or any other morning diner. The service was excellent, but damnit the bacon was over the top.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,30,19,5,7zMN06Kv6Ac6oPeomBZ8GQ

The Donut Bar has been killing it since day one here in Vegas, by staying true to classic fried delights of my childhood, but also upgrading a few of the sprinkled covered favorites. I've tried good portion of the offerings here, but the real standouts for me are the coconut covered donut, The Old fashioned, the peanut butter chocolate, the Pop-Tart donut, and a classic pink frosted donut simply dubbed, ""The Homer"".

Every bite is soft; flavor packed and melts in your mouth. The icing on all of these gorgeous bakery beauties is made in house along all the donut fillings, no store bought stuff here. This process of making in everything in-house really helps to keep the quality on point; three visits later and the donuts have the same mouthwatering consistency. I will keep traveling here for these amazing donuts all the way from Henderson which wasn't the case for O' Face, R.I.P. Sorry, but a dry donut that's lavender and lemon flavored just wasn't for me, especially when they cost close $6 a piece. 

If you simply can't decide on what calorie bombs to order, just have the people behind the counter put together a half  for you, trust me it will be amazing.

1. Crème brulee - they try and immolate the real dessert, and it doesn't disappoint. I normally don't like cream filling donuts, but this was light and sweet all that the same time.

2. Oreo / Bday cake - tasted just like it sounds

3. Some sort of strawberry filled donut

All three were amazing, coming from a chocolate and glazed kind of guy.

I walked in and was greeted by a super friendly staff. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. My friend was there waiting with a vegan green matcha tea doughnut, a creme brûlée, and a apple fritter. We headed outside to the court yard and went to town. 

The apple fritter was the best donut I've ever eaten. It was crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. There was real apples scattered throughout the donut. The green matcha tea was a delicious cake donut that wasn't overly sweet and had orange zest. It was delicious. The creme brûlée was soft and oozed out a delicious and thick creme. I was thoroughly impressed... in fact... it was happy hour when we were done so I got an entire variety box for 5 dollars and gave them to my family and friends. 

This is definitely my new favorite donut place. I can't wait to come back and try more of their vegan options!",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,7,6,5,9N-i-a0Y8Med6cX-wzVTTA

The french toast donut is the go to donut.  Just imagine a massive circular french toast covered in powered sugar and then the drizzle of the warm maple syrup.  Other donuts to consider would be the Big Pappa Donut which has a whole pop tart inside the donut!  This thing weights 1lb!  Next you have to get the creme brulee donut which is a soft yeast round filled with creme brulee and topped with caramelized sugar!  The next must have would be the Oh My Birthday Cake Oreo which is Birthday Cake Oreo stuffed donut topped with cake batter glaze, pastel sequins, and cookie crumbs.

Staff are very helpful as we had lots of questions. We had already drooled over their photo of blueberry with Meyer lemon topping: amazing.

The creme brulee was the next choice, followed by Mexican Hot Chocolate and Oreo. We took some old fashioneds to go. Well, now. I post healthy foods and recipes online, but donuts are an exclusion and we do indulge! All of these donuts were superb!! We sat in the small indoor bench area next to the Donut fish tank.

Anyways, after cutting a piece of each flavor to taste them, I ended up freezing them because I couldn't possibly eat them all in one sitting, well I could, but I decided I shouldn't. Well let me tell you, have any of you guys tried frozen donuts before? It was probably even better than when I tried it fresh! How could that be possible?!

Forgive me for not knowing exact amounts but there were a lot of the matcha green tea cake donuts, several blueberry lemon cake donuts, and some raspberry pistachio yeast donuts. I was most excited for the matcha donuts because I'm obsessed with matcha. This donut was an absolute success, it made the perfect cake donut. It was sweet but not overly so and the matcha flavor was prominent without being overbearing. I loved the texture of it as a cake donut, definitely could have eaten twenty more of these.

I then tried the raspberry pistachio yeast donut which was as big as my face. Seriously, the thing was HUGE! I'm generally not a fan of yeast donuts because they lack flavor, this yeast donut however had the perfect fluffy texture and was buttery. the raspberry pistachio icing was incredible as well, slightly tart but mostly sweet with subtle hints of pistachio. It melted in my mouth with each bite, I was sad but very full when it was all over.

I really want to go back to try their creme brûlée donut, as well as any others they're offering. I'm reading reviews about their donuts being dry but I didn't have that experience at all.

I try and try and try and I can't bring myself to get excited over them. We came here when they first opened and I thought ""They don't have their temperatures/ measurements converted to the altitude of Vegas"" as they're a shop based out of San Diego if
I'm remembering correctly. 

If you order a plain donut that's not filled or stuffed with a cookie, they're all dry :(. The worst part is that they're so expensive. A single plain donut is $2. Anywhere else a single glazed donut is .99 cents or less. They only get more expensive the more ""creative"" they get. The French toast donut is really good but doesn't need the syrup or extra blueberry topping since the donut is already covered in powdered sugar AND glaze. When you're feeling extra gluttonous I think it hits the spot. The only other saving grace is their hazelnut Kona coffee which I think I found the same one online so I can save myself the trip, parking meter fee, and disappointment of dry donuts.",dLoUSe9E25agXphQjx8Svg,3,2,2,yT0_d8YhAp2Ku5QBQAyn6A

 Husband went downtown early sat to get some to try since we heard about the place being so great and that they ""sell out"". Yeah ok. All first timers or tourists and not repeat customers I'd be sure! 
2 days later and they are still sitting on my counter, most untouched, after we ""tried"" a tasting of a few of them..... And I have a house full of kids, one of which is a teenage boy,  if that tells you anything! If they won't eat it you KNOW it's bad! Lol! 
The cream brûlée (best seller!?! Ugh!) was disgusting. Tasteless hard coating of topping that sticks in your teeth on top of basically bread with literally a teaspoon amount of supposed Bavarian creme (also not made fresh, definitely out of a can). Ick! Every one we tried had the exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread like dough. I would compare it very much like the French bread loaves you get at Walmart for $1 topped or filled with multiple variations of whatever disgusting sugar concoction you can think of. Frosting (any of them) is nothing special and entirely pointlessly overdone, tastes like store bought in the cake isle. Apple tart topped with bacon one was dry (as were all of them due to the ""bread"" dough they use). I'm not sure how in the world you can make an apple filling tasteless but they did it! Dumped straight out of a can. Super disappointed since that one looked the most promising. The pop tart one... Well that is one that is still sitting untouched on the counter. Just grossly huge, pop tart wrapped in bread, filled with some sort of sickly sweet jelly, and topped with more sugar type topping. Oh! And sprinkles! Puke! My kids wouldn't even touch it. 
There is also a sponge bob one so decorated with the gross frosting that my 7 yr old didn't event attempt it. 
Basically it is clear that the object of this place is to make things ""look"" interesting enough to buy but absolutely no attention to actual taste, quality or ingredients. Nothing even remotely tastes like it was hand made fresh. Everything is ingredients you can buy in the cake isle (and bread isle) at the grocery store and make yourself. Blagh!

Anyway, this place isn't bad.  To me, and this is just my own opinion and taste, this place is like any ordinary donut shop but with certain perks making this donut shop a tad bit different from other places.

1)      A few of their donuts are ""Vegan""
2)      They have clever names that complement the donut
3)      They have treats for your furry friends

My first time going, I went right before they opened.  I was the first in line and lines form fast right before opening.  I ordered, which was the day after the news of music icon Prince passing, the Price Donut, Crème Brule, Banana Caramel and the Boston Cream.  The Prince donut was well decorated with his symbol and filled with raspberry.  I liked it.  It was okay for me.  I did notice that the donuts I ordered, weren't as sweet as some other donut shops (not including frostings).  This was a plus for me, the amount of sweetness to the donuts were good for my liking.  The Crème Brule (Vegan), I wasn't a big fan of the ""caramel drizzle"" over the donut.  Some will like it, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  Everything under that topping was okay as well.  I love bananas so I tried the Banana Caramel (Vegan), and that was okay too.  At first bite, banana runts came to mind.  Last, Boston Cream.  I love donuts filled with custard, so I couldn't leave a donut shop without getting one.  This too was okay.  The breading wasn't too sweet, but the sweetness of the frosting complemented this donut well.

I really wanted the cinnamon roll with the bacon, but that wasn't ready when I got there.  There was a 15 minute wait :(

I'm still coming back to try that cinnamon roll with bacon and the french toast donut. :)

I got the chocolate bacon donut bar and the ""Nutella Overload."" It's too bad I didn't eat them right when I bought them, so as to have identified the MAJOR problem early on and confronted the shop about it, but I saved the donuts for a late afternoon treat-yo-self after some hours of blackjack. This is how it went down:

I take a few bites of the chocolate bacon...it's aight, your typical donut, definitely has its work cut out for itself to catch up to the maple bacon bar of Voodoo Donuts in Portland, OR. 

Next up, I take a big bite of the Nutella Overload, expecting a blobby, sludgy Nutella infusion. Ummm, NO. It's a plain dry donut. Baffled, I take another large bite. NOTHING. I frantically rip apart this stupid donut and THERE IS NO NUTELLA WHATSOEVER IN THE DONUT, let alone an ""OVERLOAD."" 

There is not even a swipe, dab, drop, lick, or smidgeon to be seen of the signature brown chocolate hazelnut heaven paste anywhere inside of the donut. Nada, nien, niet, RIEN! 

If the Nutella Overload cost $1, then I'd shrug it off. But $4 paired with deceptive advertising of ""overload"" is appalling. 

Also, their hours are arbitrary and thus, suck. Just make more donuts. You're a self-proclaimed donut ""bar."" Lastly, it's tiny on the inside and located on a nondescript street. Hardly a place that meets the expectations created by way of their larger-than-life website.

Part of the problem is that they are all looks and less about substance. The donuts are okay, just okay. The yeast donuts are big and fluffy, but they lack flavor. For instance their birthday cake donut looks pretty but it just tastes like a donut - there's nothing to suggest it tastes like birthday cake. No icing, no batter, none of that 'eggy' flavor. All the other yeast donuts were similar. The cake donuts are a better bet, but I only had one of those, so maybe I bet on the wrong horse so to speak.

It's worth a try, but it's not the best donuts you'll ever have. I would suggest sticking to cake donuts if you do come here.",pppIHoA8b8B8Wd5t72sDxA,10,6,3,OxvvxrSQTvJB1rMZ_2eFmQ

Other donuts we had were the Apple Crumb Cake, Strawberry Shortcake, Boston Cream, and the Nutella overload. Every donut was made really well and unlike some donut shops we've been to, these weren't overly sweet or too rich. They were a perfect balance with the dough itself being fluffy and light. As far as decor there is a nice and quite fitting tribute to Homer Simpson around and if he were to try Donut Bar he'd definitely approve! I would say the one downside of this location is just the location itself and size. It's towards downtown so you need to take lyft/uber/taxi if visiting from out of town and staying on the strip. The shop itself has an incredible display for all their donuts but since it's a small building only has bar stool seating for about 8-10 people.

It's been in my bookmarked list for the next time I came to Vegas, and I finally got to try them. When you walk in the aroma of fresh donuts hits you in the face. It's also super cute and colorful. I love that you could see all the donuts on display as well as the colors of the place. It's very warm and welcoming. The staff is also extremely nice and patient. I say patient because I was so eager to get inside and take pictures and create a video. Haha. However as far as taste, their donuts are pretty average. 

They have tons of donuts to choose from but we ended up getting the Big Poppa Tart Donut, Strawberry Filled Donut, and they gave us a free candy cane donut because we had our 14 month old daughter with us. How cool is that?! Very nice and thoughtful. I have never had a donut place offer a free kids donut. However, I will say their donuts are a little more on the expensive side, but most are bigger than your average donut so it balances out. 

The Big Poppa Tart was definitely big and enough to share. I got the Strawberry one. It's made to look like an oversized Pop-tart. The cool thing is, there is an entire pop tart on the inside of the Big Poppa Tart. The donut itself was very good and tender. It also tasted amazing with the strawberry jam on top. Now I will be honest and say I didn't care much for the Pop-tart on the inside. It was chewy and a little stale tasting as far as texture. It didn't taste like a regular Pop-Tart. I guess something changes as the donut is heated and fried. Overall, the Big Poppa Tart is pretty and the edges taste really good. My husband ate my entire half of my Big Poppa and he never said a thing about the Pop-Tart so I guess it didn't bother him. He just said he couldn't taste it. *Shrugs* I guess it's more of a personal preference.

The Strawberry Filled tasted pretty good. I didn't get to taste it because my husband killed it but overall it was good he said. He said it honestly didn't taste like anything special or different than any other Strawberry Filled Donut he has had. I will say this is one of their smaller donuts. If you order a circular shaped donut then these are the bigger ones.

I also didn't taste my daughter's donut but my husband did. He said it tasted like a regular donut. I guess she liked it because she ate it all. It was just a donut in the shape of a candy cane with white and red glaze on top. 

Overall, Donut Bar was cute and fun! As far as taste, I don't think they were anything special. They were pretty average. I will say their creativity of their donuts and some of the flavors is unique but other than that they taste just like any other donut shop.",Xvv0P_0B57LoyGrVHGG_8A,15,10,3,EE3icjK4j3R4l942CowoRg

3559672,2018-01-23,0,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"I have a love/hate relationship with Donut Bar. Unquestionably, the donuts are good. Are they worth $5 a piece? Definitely not. 

Donut Bar has an excellent variety and without a doubt grade A marketing. I'll literally be scrolling through Instagram, see a photo of their donuts, and instantly begin prioritizing my need to drive all the way downtown to pick up a French Toast donut. 

In comparison to other donut shops throughout the valley, Donut Bar offers a variety of vegan donuts, made to order options, and some very ""creative"" choices- such as the ""Big Poppa tart"", a donut literally stuffed with a pop tart. As for the quality- arguable. Yes, they open super early and obviously if you get there later in the day they won't be as ""fresh""- but hey, if I'm getting a ""stale"" donut it seems obscure to pay $4 or $5 for it. Definitely think they need a price adjustment. 

Flavor is a 10/10. In all the times I've been to donut bar I can honestly say I've never not loved the taste of any of their donuts. My most favorite would have to be the strawberry shortcake and the Oreo birthday cake- both absolutely delicious! 

The employees are also very kind and are very quick to give recommendations. I've been here super early at opening to when they were just about sold out and have always experienced exceptional service. 

Overall, Donut Bar is great- I'd just recommend an early arrival and preparation to pay upwards of $30 for a half dozen donuts.",xFIJOdPk3SQWUm4wadPnUg,1,0,4,s-tTC-oqNpXCkMh42DYXsQ

After all, imho it had a large shoes to fill because of the prior tenant O Face Donuts.
Sure, O face is now gone and one should not compare a defunct business to the next. But I cannot help it and I feel if you take the time to read what I mean, you may just end up agreeing.
There is only one single difference between the two shops yet the difference is such a critical element. Creative originality.
The Donut bar attempts to dazzle you with concoctions that are really just kids play.
The creme brulee is creative in thought yet executed with no afterthought.
Yea, the sugar is cool however only after one bite. 
Attempting to get through the constant crunch soon became annoying. 
I found myself trying to taste the center cream however once the sugar coating finally dissolved and my taste buds came to I found it to be just commercial custard filling.
Very disappointing.
The maple...
O face had was one step ahead of everyone on this. 
When you go to a donut shop,no matter what part of the U.S. you go, you know what a maple bar taste like. It doesn't change and when you have one, you have had them all.
O face however took the time to develop their own maple glaze which complemented the bacon. Donut bar..the same usual maple.
The oreo cookie
Jeez...how much sugar can you give?
People, this is a regular glazed stuffed with an oreo cookie. 
mmmm Lard

O face made donuts that were not only creative but containing other unique flavors.
Mexican chocolate with horchata creme...yea, their own homemade horchata,not a tub filled with flavored gelatin goo 

Apple fritter.
Dark. Happen to notice this to as the tray containing the fritters all looked the same,over done.
To their credit, the inside was not overdone and actually the best of the group of donuts I had.


In a nutshell, this is no O Face and probably never will be. I suppose this means I need to find something more on the level of my expectations. Which leads me to a final thought.
Donuts that cost 2-4$ per should be on the level of artisanal. Otherwise, what am I paying for that I couldn't already get at Von's?",9ffzn6naBCZUSzXXuQy5EQ,1,0,2,lMEwyLkJp13XMwg2AJQJ9g
3599459,2016-05-04,14,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Having jury duty earlier this month allowed me to drop by Donut Bar for two days straight.

First visit-11:30am...choosing from what was left, I tried a Strawberry Cheesecake and a Boston Creme.
Both tasted okay, but the chocolate glaze on the boston creme wasn't only excessively sweet but looked dull, not shiny like other donut shops, and the dough part itself was a little more dense for my liking. 
Gave Donut Bar the benefit of the doubt and decided to catch them earlier the next day.

Second visit-7:30am...arriving with a full display, I perused the list and ordered three types of cake donuts: Matcha, Blueberry Meyer Lemon, and The Samoa. I also ordered a Creme Brulee Donut and their special donut of the day, Strawberries and Cream. Best of the batch was the Creme Brulee Donut and the Strawberries and Cream not far behind. The yeast raised donut items here aren't as light and fluffy, but more dense and are alot darker than other shops around town. The cake donuts sound better than they actually tasted and I just took one bite of each and couldn't get passed how DRY each of them were. Couldn't taste matcha or meyer lemon, but sugary sweet(and I got there half an hour after they opened)

Service was okay,  and price point is kinda iffy with the fact that there are other shops in town that charge less for a better tasting product that won't leave you with buyers remorse. Like that song goes, ""I'm a classic man""...I like classic style donuts that light and fluffy,  and  aren't hidden by thick glazes and don't need  the addition of an oreo or pop tart. To me, less is more, and maybe third time's the charm, but for now,  I'm in no hurry to rush back.  ALOHA!!!

On our first visit, we got here around 8am and there was a good amount of people in line to get donuts. They had everything from creative choices like their version of a Pop-Tart, a variety of sugary cartoon characters, jelly donuts and their take on the classic cake creations. The problem with going first thing in the morning is that your eyes are bigger than your stomach, and you end up ordering a ton. Totally worth it. Nothing beats remembering you have a box of these treats in your hotel room after a day of drinking, or whatever it is you do in Vegas.

If you come around 11am, which has been the case on most of our visits, they box up the remaining donuts from the morning and sell them for $10 a pop. You don't get to choose, but it's still a steal if you don't care which ones you get.

They also have variations of Stumptown Coffee if you need a caffeine boost. It's offered in hot and cold forms, but the cold brew is my favorite between the two, especially if you're going during the warmer months.

Plenty of metered parking on the street and behind the building in a shared lot. If you want to sit and eat, they have some counter space inside, and a shared outdoor area with some tables and chairs too.

Not my cup of tea BUT someone else may love it. The vegan selection was smaller than I thought because there were only 2 options at the time I went in but it's nice they have some. The filling was good and the people nice. Again the review is based on my taste and preferring a glaze versus the crust of the creme brulee.

We arrived at about 9am and the line was out the door, but it moved quickly since the workers are efficient, skilled, and friendly!  We easily found metered street parking right in the front of the shop on Carson Avenue.  I ran right in and was done before the meter maid caught me!  Oh yeah for ""free parking""!

Donut Bar is a cozy place where the width of the shop showcases their eye-popping product.  There's a row of stools along the counter on the far wall if you want to dine there.  

The colors, designs, and names of the donuts really intrigued me. It was so difficult to make a decision, but I finally settled on the Caramelized pineapple and the Coconut Dream. ..

I'm from the Aloha State and I haven't seen a pineapple donut before.  Mmm mmm... it was a delight!  The Coconut Dream was even better because it reminded me of a Mounds candy with a thin layer of chocolate between the donut and the coconut layer.  Yummy! Both donuts were $3 each. They did leave an oily spot on the wax paper that lined the box... and a bit of an oily feel in the mouth.  The donut itself seemed a bit denser and less cakey in texture.  

I want to go back for the Mexican Hot Chocolate, creme brulee, chocolate bacon, and the Strawberry Split. .. (note: vegan options are available!)   I heard that there is a Donut Bar in San Diego. .. oh oh...here we come!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,39,35,4,Jcjh2mo4Ok9xISX4BmflRA

3876010,2016-05-06,3,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Everyone jumped on the hype train when this place first opened and took over the old O Face Doughnuts location. My first run-in with Donut Bar was when I lived in San Diego in 2013. They were one of the first West Coast shops to try to emulate the cronut, which at the time, had just been invented by Dominique Ansel and was an overnight sensation. Donut Bar's Gaslamp location was very much like this one. There were huge lines that stretched out the door in the morning and they were often sold out by midday. In fact, I never did get to try one of their cronuts or ""cro-bars,"" rather. 

Flash forward three years and once again Donut Bar is the darling of the donut world and selling out on a daily basis by 1 pm. I've visited this location twice now (but really once because one time it was sold out), and I'm still unconvinced that the majority of these doughnuts are that spectacular. For the most part, the novelty is the large size, especially the Big Poppa Tart, but I felt sick trying to finish an entire one myself. This fact holds true for most of the other large, yeast doughnuts as well, all priced $3-4.

However, the one doughnut that I felt was unique enough to return here for was the crème brûlée. The caramelized sugar topping has that deeply satisfying crack when broken in half and the filling flavor is completely on par with that of a vanilla crème brûlée. It's advertised as vegan and also only $2. 

Overall, I wasn't impressed by the size or price. The yeast donuts turned dense if you didn't get them fresh. But highlights include the can't miss crème brûlée donuts and Stumptown coffee (which just so happens to be my favorite coffee).",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,4,4,3,xoQsikSDWktc27seggWlnQ

I am so impressed with how delicious, fluffy, and chewy their donut are. I bought the cake batter, blueberry cheesecake, Nutella, samoa, Homer's donut, and the red velvet donuts. 

I came in around 11 AM during their soft opening and there were quite a few good choices left. Unfortunately the strawberry split & Oreo one was sold out  but that's okay because what I got was tasty! 

Donut Bar compared to other donut shops around town is their HUGE donuts ($4 each), and unique ones like the Oreo inside the donut, the pop tart inside the donut, and hopefully the donut cones soon (well that's what they advertised on their Instagram). The dough is exceptionally chewy, moist, the toppings are even & proportionate, and most importantly the frosting isn't overly sweet.

This donut shop is gourmet and heightened flavors.  When I brought home the extra donuts for the hubby and kids, they generally ignored them.  I was disappointed, but the hubby said that the flavors were outside of the kids wheelhouse.  

I know that the place has kid friendly options on the weekend and the chocolate milk on draft will draw my little one in.  So, maybe, I need to bring them in and let them pick their own flavor options.

Here's what we tried.  The dipped old fashion was eh.  The Pop Tart was amaze-balls.  Coworker and I took turns with the plastic knife as we cut off sections.  The jelly inside is tasty.  The frosting is perfect and not too much.  The bacon on top of the Brad fritter should just be served by itself.  I wanted to eat it all.  Coworker told me to, as she like the fritter, but the bacon was a bit off putting for her.  She had the blueberry cheesecake; didn't share.  Split the creme brulee.

For this sugary breakfast I ordered a red velvet donut, which was awesome. Their balance of sugar to the cream is so satisfying.

My favorite thing about donut bar is their creme brûlée donut with the crunchy sugar coating and the creamy custard filling. Why are they putting less coating and less filling?! 

Donut bar has the most bready donuts. They are seriously just slightly sweet bread that are oversized or overly decorated. I have probably tried all of their donuts and they are just not good in my opinion.

Their donut cone with soft serve is good and their creme brûlée donut used to be good.

The donuts were big & flavorful. I got the 'Cake Batter donut' & my sister got the 'Homer'! They only frost the top then it's a plain donut under which is great for balancing out the sweetness of the frosting.

The staff was nice & welcoming even told us where more seating was located. They made suggestions on which donuts were most popular & gave us adequate time to make a decision. 

The overall environment was clean, cute & artsy. This location was quiet & away from the crowd which was nice.

JUST AN FYI, just like most donut shops, they will run out of certain donuts so definitely show up early if you want a certain type that may be popular on their menu aka the creme brûlée donut. But I don't regret what I got! I went with the red velvet donut and the db Nutella! The red velvet was not bad! It wasn't too sweet so it's not too overwhelming to be considered a meal on its own. The only thing was with the latter was that I felt as though there was too much bread with the donut to Nutella ratio but maybe because the donut itself was HUGE.

I was one of the lucky few that got to attend the Homer's Wet Dream event where I was able to sample many of the donuts sold by Donut Bar, so when making plans to dine at nearby Carson Kitchen one Sunday I decided to stop into Donut Bar first to sample more of their offerings. 

I already knew that the Bigga Poppa, with a entire poptart inside, is the bomb. At $4 it's on the pricey side, but 2-3 people could share one of these, it's THAT big. The Crème Brûlée is another donut I like, it is priced at $2 and is more of a standard sized donut.  

For me.... it is all about the French Toast donut, cooked to order. If I had to choose one kind of donut to have for the rest of my life, it would be this one. Paired with a Stumptown Cold Brew, and you have one deliciously sweet breakfast.

Even if the over-the-top, stuffed donuts don't do anything for you, Donut Bar is worth a visit just to try the delicious French Toast Donut. (Sold weekends only)",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,5,7,4,yvfjQZ-H3ytSNvRNqY9Xog
4052474,2017-01-27,8,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Short Review:  
Donut Bar originated in San Diego and places an emphasis on fresh, tasty, picture worthy, and creative donuts.  If a caked donut full of sugar is your thing, then give Donut Bar a try.  Donut Bar is considered one the best and their customer service is excellent.  Just be early because these donuts sell out fast. 

Longer Review:  
I remember the excitement when Donut Bar opened in Las Vegas.  I'm not going to lie.  I wasn't that excited when I heard the news. I didn't bookmark this place and had the opinion that Donut Bar was just hype. I'm originally from the 619 and remember when the first Donut Bar opened their doors in Daygo. I was one of those people that waited in line. The owner of that location was pretty cool and would walk by the line with full sized donut samples to patrons waiting to get in. Originally, I wasn't a fan.  I had a few failed visits because their donuts were either out or I got something that was too sweet.  I always picked a donut that just didn't ""wow"" me. I am also not into a cake donut with a bunch of sugar on it. I'm really boring when it comes to my donuts. I prefer a chocolate glazed raised donut, maple bar, cruller, or an apple fritter.  That's all I really need or want when I'm in a donut shop.  But when the girlfriend loves donuts, then you support her by eating donuts.  I have been here a couple of times since grand opening week.  I've tried the Samoa, The French Toast, Cake Batter, Caramel Latte, the Big Poppa Tart, Crème Brulee, Matcha Cake, PB&J, and of course, the Homer. Their originality, freshness, and consistency stands out.  I haven't had anything here that was too oily and greasy.  Again, these donuts really do not appeal to me and in my opinion, just too sweet. But then I had their Caramel Latte.  This donut is perfectly glazed with their latte flavor.  Then a little whipped cream and caramel is added. Because this donut is large, the glaze and toppings do not give it that overly sweet taste.  The texture is also perfect and not dry at all. This donut with a cup of their hot coffee equals perfection.  I will cheat on my chocolate raised donut any day for their Caramel Latte.  This donut alone made me a fan.

I regret that I didn't check out the online menu to see what types they had before going there. So it was a bit over-whelming trying to view/choose what to order because the line moved too quickly. I tried the lemon cake donut drizzled with a cream cheese frosting glaze & took back a huge blueberry glazed donut (I forget what there  actual names are). If that wasn't enough, I was fortunate enough to try the Homer Simpson pink donut w/ sprinkles (they always sell out, so go early). Well...they were all wonderfully delicious. But, I'm glad they are not located close to where I reside otherwise, I would be there at least once a week & that wouldn't be good for my waist line (yikes).

It was shocking to see a 4 person line because the one in San Diego runs out the door and down the street.

many
selections.... can i order them all ;P

When you can't decide ALWAYS STICK TO THE ONE THAT CAUGHT YOUR EYE FIRST. And that delicious fattening fried batter goes to....

OHH MY BIRTHDAY CAKE OREO 

It was a very good donut but... I like my donuts with a little more fluff, a lot less sugar, and a custard texture in the middle. This was different. This was a donut with a reconstructed Oreo in the middle, with cake icing on the top with crumbles of Oreo and cake confetti. Sugar sugar and more sugar. If you strip all that and taste the donut, it's actually nothing special without that extra flavoring. The donut itself was dry. Again, good donut... I just have had a really good donut elsewhere that I hold high standards too. 

I'll be real honest though... donut bar seems to only be good because of the flavoring that covers the donut. Strip all that way and you have a boring stale and dry donut.

It's like a new wave going on with donut chains popping up in cities.  I feel a little bad for the mom and pop shops, they're going to have to step up their game.  It's one thing to have cute and creative donuts but the most important part is that it has to taste good as well.  

I wanted to try the pretzel shape donut, but I didn't see it when I got there, so the the worker told me about a french toast donut that was made fresh.  It took about several minutes to make, and it tasted just like what it was called a, ""French Toast Donut"".  It was literally a french toast donut.  I also ordered the bitrhday donut with oreo inside and a glazed buttermilk for my boyfriend. All the donuts we ordered exceeded or expectations.  I can't wait to come back next time, and hopefully get my hands on the pretzel donut.

Came here on a random Wednesday morning around 8:30 am and parked on the street for $2 (didn't see any other parking).  I had heard that this place could have a line out the door with people waiting to order...I was a little worried that there might be a line to get donuts and at this point I was getting a little hangry.  Fortunately for us there were only about 4-5 other patrons inside and we didn't have to wait at all!  We were instantly greeted by the peppy workers with warm smiles and hellos, the place itself is pretty small with seating for only about 5-6 people inside.  They did say they had seating outside, but we didn't check it out because we were able to snag seats inside. 

My friend and I really didn't know what to order so they gave us a couple of recommendations.  I also was super excited because they serve Stumptown Coffee from Portland here!  We ended up getting 4 donuts, 1 chocolate milk, and 1 Stumptown Coffee cold brew for the both of us all for about $20-$25.  A little on the pricier side, but just remember people these are specialty donuts not your run-of-the-mil grocery store ones.  I don't remember the specific names of the donuts so sorry in advance!
-Donut with Strawberry Pop Tart In It -   Delicious, but wow this is super sweet!  My friend and I felt like we had to make an appt with our dentist after eating this one
-Crème Brule Donut - This was the best one in my opinion, the outside had a nice crispy glaze covering it and when I say crispy I mean crispy, it had a tasty cream inside that wasn't overly sweet either
-Lemon Cream Donut - My second favorite out of the bunch, the lemon whipped cream inside was amazing and they put a ton of the whipped cream inside too!
-Boston Cream Donut Bar - This was probably the most basic donut out of the bunch, it was your standard boston cream donut bar...why my friend decided to get a basic donut at a specialty donut shop I will never know, but I digress...it was still decent! 
-Cold Brew - not as good when I had it in Portland, it tasted a little bit on the bitter side but still delicious nonetheless

I for sure see myself coming back here whenever I want a tasty specialty donut, probably on a weekday morning though because nobody wants to wait in a ridiculously long line (sorry to all you normal 9-5 workers out there, I'll think about you the next time I eat here).",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,1,1,4,NLoDVMjV5Rx_zuFM1nEtyw

Now you are probably wondering if I ate them all, and the answer is yes, or at least a sampling of them. We brought the goods back to the hotel. We used Uber to get there from The Ventician, and it. The cost of Uber was around 12 dollars roundtrip.

Let's just say there was not one donut in the three boxes we got that wasn't super yummy!!! My favorite was the cinnamon roll and bacon. So much bacon on it and in it too. I found a couple of strips of bacon ribboned through the roll. Best part is that i checked in on Yelp and got a great cup of coffee to with my donuts.

However, some donuts like their grilled cheese and french toast are made to order. Note that they may not offer the grilled cheese and french toast donuts every day though. 

Having been to the Donut Bar in San Diego, I can say the Las Vegas location is definitely bigger and less crowded (at least on a Saturday morning, though I guess it's off season for Vegas right now). 

I'd say it's most worth to come here if you're excited to try their unique flavors. Blood orange, birthday cake oreo, and the blueberry cheesecake are delicious and not too sweet actually! Also, if you buy a dozen, you get one donut free. We ended up spending $29 (including tax) for three big donuts and 10 small ones, which runs a bit pricey but I'd argue it's worth it especially if you're splitting donuts. The big donuts are gigantic anyways and are (more than) worth the $3. 

Service is friendly and location is hard to miss (with a big donut painted on the outside of the building).",FmT02HSztydHH4o2sJ7UeA,1,0,4,tvbW3BJFbe3kwZfq0evhzQ

I read an article that this spot would be opening in the same location as a former donut shop. On Sunday I was finally downtown doing one of my make my own food crawls and knew I needed to stop in.

We were warmly greeted right away by the employees and the delicious looking donuts. :) Since we were doing a food crawl we narrowed to two donuts, but we were offered some free donuts and who can pass on free donuts? I'm glad that I was able to try several flavors and get a good idea of what they offer. 

The apple donut was my favorite. It had a nice spice cake flavor with small chunks of apple in the cake and a nice glaze on top. The chai donut was unique and also hit the spot. The birthday cake donut had Oreo in the center and was tasty as well. The vanilla was my friend's favorite and while simple, I loved this one as well. The chocolate fritter was less moist than the other donuts and had a nice flavor, but wasn't my favorite of the bunch. Overall, nice texture and awesome flavor for the donuts.

We also enjoyed some of the delicious Stumptown coffee. Stumptown is always delicious and quality coffee is always good with a donut. I also tried the Nitro brew which was bold and perfect with the sweet donuts.

The employees were very friendly and generous in making sure we were able to try as much as possible during our visit. I love visiting a local business where I can feel the pride in the business.

The dough wasn't as perfectly light as I like. And I really prefer for the entire donut to have a thick layer of glaze - this did not. Also, the filling was barely sweetened and basically tasted like butter. 

However, after brunch at eat. I figured I might as well stop by and give it another chance. This time I knew not to get a yeast donut and to try the cake instead. I went with one Strawberry Cream Cheese and one Apple Crumble. The latter was nice, but the Strawberry was even better because it was super sweet and flavorful. (In case you couldn't tell, I expect as much sugar as possible.) But both were moist on the inside (the Strawberry even had little juicy specks of red) and the outside had a nice thick glaze.

There location isn't too far from downtown Fremont and the Container Park, So this is alway a good option to come to first thing in the morning.  That's probably the best time to come in is early, they alway sell out fast and all the good options are gone if you decided to come in later in the day. 

I have been lucky so far to alway grab my favorites before they sale out. My go-to's are alway the birthday Cake, the Homer, and a Nutella one. I even love the Churro Cone with Ice Cream. 
My favorite time to come here is on the weekend. It should I say my little ones favorite time to come here is on Saturday or Sunday, they alway give out free donuts to kids. They make them a featured character and have it all decorated out.  Last time we came here and got our free donut they were handing out Ninjago Donuts, my son was super excited and absolutely went crazy with pure happiness. He has now made it a point to request we go there everyday, but unfortunately my metabolism won't be able to keep up with that request, so we opt for the weekends only lol.  
If your lucky enough to come on happy hour you can grab a box full for $10, the only sad part is you don't know when they will have it or if they will. It's usually before they close and depending on how much they have left. So it's alway a win win when you come in, you can grab a speciality donut, or a free kids character donut, or a happy hour box.  
Either way you will definitely not be displeased with the quality of the donuts, and you can always walk off the calories at Fremont or Container Park.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,3,1,5,UL8RDiVAaulccVjUmLCU6A

They had dozens of other delicious looking donuts, ranging in sizes, which I liked too.  If you're just there for a quick bite, grab a small donut.  If you're in the mood to indulge, they have enormous donuts in all sorts of unusual flavors and with great decorations.

I got there around 2:30pm just as they were closing, so they were selling the donuts for $10 per box. I thought it was a good deal until I actually tried the donuts. They were awful. I tried all of the vegan donuts that they had left. Apple fritter, salted caramel, Creme brûlée, and peanut butter and jelly. They were all hard and stale. The apple fritter was burnt on the bottom.  The top of the Creme brûlée was like a hard piece of plastic. I was shocked at how bad the product was, especially since they are surrounded by so many great eateries in the area. They should be embarrassed selling that kind of garbage, even if it is closing time.

I definitely do not recommend this place.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,27,11,1,wXuNzRNxKOvTeYxobkseHw

The outside is that caramelized sugar and the inside is a fluffy donut with vanilla creme. It's something that will be on your mind until you go back. Other than the donut, my favorite part was the vanilla custard/ ice cream in a cinnamon sugar donut cone. Yup, you heard me right. And it was drizzled in caramel sauce. Let's just say it got a little messy, but was so worth it. I came back every other day for a week for it.

Donut bar is very creative with their menu, everything we had tasted great my only gripe was some of the donuts tasted stale, I think this has more to do with the way they are being displayed and stored which ends up drying them out faster, because the make all their stuff fresh everyday and when they run out they are out. This brings me to my second point, the earlier you go the better these donuts taste, and the more variety you get. Overall I would say try it for yourself  not sure what it's called (apple fritter maybe) was amazing.

Jokes aside, these donuts are something else. I would HIGHLY recommend you share a donut with a friend (or two) and not take one on yourself like I did.

Go early as they do sell out throughout the day. My first time here, I was browsing the huge selection but what caught my eye was PISTACHIO. All time favorite, had to try it - even if it was pistachio lemon. Boy was I impressed. The lemon flavor punches you in the face, but the pistachio caresses you and makes it all better. The balance of flavor they manage to pack into the donut is spectacular. The size is on the outrageous side, but it definitely makes it worth the price. Their coffee is also top notch and pairs well with any donut you decide to devour.

I would take visitors to town here, but I would hesitate on coming regularly. Although it's a damn good donut, my stomach would hate me.",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,1,1,4,cb600g8-n20elDvh-oa57w

The restroom and the restaurant layout is very nice! The restroom doesn't have a mirror just an FYI. The interior design around the restaurants suits it well.

The donuts weren't as good as I expected. I got the Creme Brûlée donut which wasn't very good. It tasted cold because it had been left out throughout the morning.

The strawberry short cake doughnuts looked amazing as did the one's with the pop tarts inside but, I chose a strawberry cheese cake doughnut, creme brulee doughnut and long doughnut filled with German cream.  Extremely creative doughnut flavors and combinations without being over the top and not well executed.

I headed back to the hotel and let me tell you the strawberry cheesecake doughnut only lasted for 4 bites.  My friend ate the other two and they lasted about the same and he kept saying how amazing they were.  I agreed because I had to stop myself from going back to get more for myself.

I can't wait to come back here. I've already started making a list of friends and family that are coming to town so that I can bring them here too (and hopefully have a little more control and spread out the donuts that I want to try). 

This place is super clean, cute, and we saw both of the owners in on a Saturday morning making the french toast donuts and handing out drinks at the counter. That is one of the greatest things to me to see because it shows me that they're really here and really passionate about their business and I am so excited to go back and support them again and again. 

Parking is very available near here, with both street parking and a pay-to-park lot directly across the street. When you enter, you are immediately greeted by so many donut options that you will feel a little overwhelmed (so many choices) but don't worry, your donut guide will be with you shortly and will help you pick a great one. 

I chose the big poppa tart, a donut the size of 2 long johns, filled with a pop tart and jam, and topped with pop tart crumbles and frosting. It was awesome. The donut was super puffy and flakey and even before getting to the pop tart middle, tasted exactly like a pop tart. Next time I really want to try the strawberry split or the french toast donut (which is made to order and served warm).

The girlfriend thought it was a molten center, but it just turned out that the center was COMPLETELY RAW!  I'm not saying this was the contributing factor to some stomach problems I had for the following few days, but exactly rule it out either.

D O N U T B A R

.. It was my first time & I heard this place was the place to be for donut lovers, which I am. Drove over to a still sleepy yet incredibly sunny downtown LV where I parked in an empty parking lot.. The heat was already starting to sear the air in my car..

I had gotten there a bit early to my surprise so it was about 11 minutes before I made my way to the entrance. I walked and turned the corner as the low murmur of the crowd awaiting reached my ears. There must have been about 7-9 people in front of me.. And by the time Donut Bar opened their door- I was no longer last, but found the line had started to wrap around the corner I had turned on earlier.. People made their way in and I trailed behind. As I stepped in, I relished in the coolness that hit me (thanks A/C). Then I saw the sight before.. Donuts, all shapes and sizes.. All different from each other and so many to choose from. But the one that caught my eye was the classic strawberry donut, you kno with the whip cream and blueberries and the stuff sits in between two halves of a donut. Oh yeah, that's the one. 

I got my goods and saw that the line had only grown even longer.. And I was immediately thankful for the rude yet early awakening. I sat outside in the little courtyard and ate the delicious thing. I could NOT even finish it- it was so giant and so good.. It was quite overwhelming ! But it was so worth. I left feeling stuffed but so happy.

Because when you are on vacation, everyone knows that all the rules of physics go out the door and any calories you consume are offset by all the walking you do.  #truth

My first order of business in Las Vegas was to find some delicious donuts other than the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts variety.  Located in downtown Vegas, I found Donut Bar!  At the time, I didn't know Donut Bar (original shop in San Diego) was listed as the Number 1 Donut Shop on lists from USA Today, Thrillist.com, MSN and more.  But as soon as I walked in, I knew I had found a gem.  

The donuts they offer are huge, over the top, and look downright amazing!  Their most popular is their Big Poppa Tart Donut which is made with a full pop tart and weighs one entire pound!  I wanted to try everything, but I decided on three:  crème brulee, blueberry with meyer lemon, and maple bacon.  The crème brulee is a yeast donut filled with crème topped with a hard candy shell.  For those with a sweet tooth, you will love biting into it.  For those that like their donuts a little less sweet, the blueberry with meyer lemon is  perfect.  The cake donut is topped with a perfectly lemony frosting.  My favorite was the maple bacon bar.  The yeast donut is so soft and topped generously with thick and chewy bacon pieces that paired with the sweet maple frosting like a dream.  Mmmmmm....

It's a bit of a gamble as they close when they sell out, but if you visit Donut Bar after 10am, they serve donut ice cream cones!!!  I will get one of those one day!",Ksk4gixS8T9N_M16AlblHA,5,7,5,BgeAC89aA4rPyZ3lekKOfg

Donut bar had even fewer...maybe 20 but not a great variety. We got a maple bacon apple fritter--the last one. It was the only one left that wasn't just a ""regular"" donut. After all, we went there to try a fun, different type of donut, not just an old fashioned or a glazed donut. So, the ""bacon"" is just bacon bits that you buy in a jar--not real, fresh bacon crumbles like I expected. The fritter was dry and didn't have nearly enough apple in it nor glaze on it.  Had it been real bacon, and more apple, maybe it would have been worth the $4.

Las Vegas' Donut Bar is located in downtown, which is a bit out of the way if you stayed along The Strip. We ended up getting a Lyft there one morning for a quick bite to eat.

If you follow them on Instagram, they post their menu daily. I was really looking forward to getting the strawberry split donut, however when we arrived - they were all out. Go early so you won't be disappointed like me. We ended up getting:

Ohh My Birthday Cake Oreo ($2)
Creme Brulee ($2)
Caramel Latte ($3)
Maple Bourbon ($3)

Caramel Latte tasted a lot like coffee and we had a hard time finishing it. Same with the Maple Bourbon. Amongst the 3 of us, we demolished the smaller ones (Creme Brulee & Birthday Cake) but had to take the other two larger donuts (Caramel Latte & Maple Bourbon) back to the hotel. Their donuts are HUGE. It's kind of hard to try all the donuts unless you're with a group. I didn't really care for the Birthday Cake one. It tasted like a funfetti cake that had an oreo inside. At least it was small so we were able to finish. By the time I tried Maple Bourbon, I was already too full and on a sugar high. That was enough donuts for me.

My favorites were the Creme Brulee and Caramel Latte, mainly because I love those flavors in general. Mmmmm the Creme Brulee was delicious with its crisp outer caramelized crust and custard filling on the inside. If I had known any better, I would have ordered a dozen of these and called it a day.

4938792,2016-04-15,1,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Overall, a decent donut shop with a friendly staff. 
Below is a breakdown of all the donuts I tried...

Strawberry Split: vegan! The fresh strawberries are a great contrast to the cream & fried donut. I wish the cream wasn't made from soy but I guess you can't be worried about GMOs at a donut shop lol

Blueberry with Meyer lemon icing: reminds me of a blueberry muffin topped with lemon frosting. Not as good as the blueberry donuts from M&M Donuts in Orange County but still good. 

Red velvet: I would have personally liked it a little softer, but overall, I can't complain. Not bad, but not anything that I'd rave about. 

Salted caramel: just really HUGE, but average tasting

Oreo birthday cake:  For your sweet tooth, this donut tastes just like the name. More like dessert than a breakfast food, but I guess that's true of most of these donuts. Props on creativity!

Crème brûlée: delicious & vegan! I just wish the hard caramel on top was a little thinner because it can overpower the yummy donut with creme filling a bit. 

Strawberry big poppa tart: A pop tart inside a donut made to look like a huge pop tart. Probably the most unique donut here. I'm not a huge fan of pop tarts but this pop tart hits the spot!

If you want to be able to choose from all of their options, I suggest coming before 10am. I came at 10:30am & they had already run out of a couple things. If you come when they are almost done, like 12:30pm, you'll only have maple bars & salted caramel donuts to choose from; however, you can buy a box full of these donuts for $10 at that time.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,5,3,4,FpVOi_k0j-yAxEuz3I-GSA

So I guess this place is famous.  I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop.  Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display!  Homer's donut?  Matcha donut?  Nutella donut?  What!?  Which should I try?  The answer is ALL OF THEM!  Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen.

The french toast donut was my favorite.  I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it.  It comes with syrup on the side as well.  My only regret is not buying two!  It was that good.  I loved Homer's donut as well.  I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top?  It was simple, but great.  The strawberry split was SO good!  My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut.  

I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut.  Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts!  Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead.  It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling.  

They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out.  I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line.  Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas!

PROTIP:  Their menu changes DAILY!  You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE!  And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum.  I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken.  This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",9S52XHEyrvOv4OZxU6pCLw,1,1,5,Ip_ZUGGJdA0bJwviX0QIFA

There were some highlights: fast service and an efficient setup to get customers in and out quickly. I always appreciate that. They also have some interesting flavors and combos. 

Lowlights: All our donuts were dry. Not being dry is the number one requirement for a good donut, and Donut bar basically failed on that one, precluding it from anything more than three stars. I also think the bacon on pastries thing has passed its prime.

This place is right by the smoothie place we went to for breakfast, so we decided to stop here for a treat after. They have a great variety of donuts and unique flavors like creme brulee. We got the blueberry lemon cake donut and the creme brulee donut. The creme brulee donut had a bruleed sugar top and a vanilla pastry cream filling. It was amazing! The donut was a perfect fluffy texture, and the filing was very creamy, and the bruleed sugar had a nice crunch. The blueberry lemon donut was great as well. I find that sometimes cake donuts can be dense, but this one was perfectly fluffy and had the perfect amount of icing on the top, so it was not overly sweet and sugary.

I've been drooling over their Instagram photos for the past couple months and I finally got to try them! 

As soon as I got there, I was in donut heaven. The smells... the gigantic size donuts... my donut fantasies wanted to try them all. Especially what I saw towards the back counter, a creative concoction with bacon on it. Next time, for sure. 

I was too full from breakfast, but my main goal was to try the donut ice cream cone! It's a fantastic concept. A cone made of donut with soft serve vanilla ice cream and a choice of chocolate or caramel drizzle. Yummmm..... the only thing I would change was the amount of sugar on the outside of the cone. It was too much sugar even for me. 

I also tried a bite of their chocolate donut with chocolate frosting & sprinkles. The dough wasn't bad, I just prefer mines a little crispier? idk if that makes sense. 

Looking forward to trying the other chocolate donuts... I hope they have something that can fill the void of my favorite Mayan donut from OFace (rich chocolate donut with ganache filling :-)) 

TIPS: 
- Check their IG or FB pages for daily menu! 
- Some days it's 2 for 1 after a certain time (check IG).
- Go there early for best selection! The golden rule for all donut shops. Or place order online. 
     (I got there around 8ish on a Friday, at that time they had a good selection)

5138947,2017-06-07,4,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Downtown Vegas. I love you and I hate you. Easy to get around for pedestrians but it's sort of like walking thru a zombie minefield of people asking for money, people talking to themselves or wondering if you're going to get mugged right around the corner. Yeah, not pretty. Perseverance is the key.

My main tip for you is Donut Bar's storefront is actually on Carson Avenue & not on 6th Street.

I planned on getting 2 donuts but everything looked so alluring I settled for 3 & dealt with the consequences later. This was my breakfast & snack for later.

Hmm. Taste was okay. For me it was very sweet but the aim to a donut's success is the texture of the dough & unfortunately all 3 of my choices were on the dry side. Maybe it was an off day? Because look at all the 4-5 Star reviews here. I am like, huh? I dunno.

Creme Brûlée Donut - Their specialty. The hard, crunchy brûlée'd exterior sticks to your teeth. The creme inside was good. 

Blueberry Cheesecake Donut-Yeast donut with comstock blueberry filling & iced cream cheese frosting was very sweet & not very cheesecake-like.

Oreo Birthday Cake Donut- Yeast donut stuffed with an Oreo cookie inside. Although the Oreo was soggy if I had to choose, I liked this donut out of my 3 picks.

I was also bummed to see they no longer had the cartons of Stump Town coffee and only a bottled version of cold brew which brought my bummer level down further.

In my eyes I prefer Mr. Donut & Donut King so for Oahuans don't fret too much if you can't get to Donut Bar on your next trip to the 9th Island. You have very good options at home.",mwc8rVfuwgfh13HB6hxYmw,4,4,3,DPCbEHEcyVJA0xijUdTd5A

I'm still sitting on the fence about it, but I've been here a few times (if that says anything)! Creme Brûlée is definitely my favorite and worth coming back for. I love that they have vegan options! I've tried The Big Poppa and Strawberry Split, which are raved about via social media and they aren't bad but elaborate donuts just aren't my thing. So maybe I'm writing this review from a sort of biased stand point.

Customer service is on point! Always. Any time, any day. Chef Jeff is fantastic and I love that he is so involved! You can see him here as soon as they open and even during the last few minutes before they close. That speaks volumes to me.

The one thing holding me back from giving it a 5 star review is the texture. They are more bread-like in texture and taste vs a traditional donut. When I think of a donut, I think of an almost fluffy, light, fried piece of heaven. It's not heavy (unless it's a cake donut, which in that case.. YUM) but it's not airy either. Am I making any sense? I hope so. 

That being said, as aforementioned, I have been a repeat customer and will continue to do so in the future. I have a few more vegan ones to try. Love that their menu changes daily and that they post it on Instagram!",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,1,4,I8NwH0cGxT7s-s6_B1Fn8Q

What makes Voodoo Donuts different from Donut Bar here in Las Vegas is that they never out.  They are continuously making their popular donuts for the people.  For example, if Donutbar knows that their French Toast donut is only sold on the weekend, then they should make enough, due to it's popularity. 
   In regards to their donuts they are super soft and fresh I truly enjoyed the split open strawberry donut because the strawberries are fresh and whipped cream is really smooth,Fresh & Light.

The place is pretty tiny, and the line can be confusing since they have two front doors and don't specify which you should enter from to get in line. I've seen some shade thrown over people jumping ahead in line because they came in the out door. For future reference, it's the easternmost door.

Fresh off an Orange County shutter reportedly due to inflated real estate rates, an import from San Diego intended to replace O-Face Doughnuts which recently closed in Downtown Las Vegas for reasons just the same, it was during the soft-opening that a stop was made at Donut Bar, the friendly manager and his team all-but giving away product - a total of three purchased by myself and a friend yielding a total order of sixteen.

Having myself already visited the San Diego location, parking a serious issue for good-yet-expensive goods that failed to wow in the same way as Sidecar, Blue Star or Stan's in LA, arrival at Donut Bar Las Vegas shows little to have changed from the space's previous occupant and although coffee has been replaced by Stumptown the prices are equally as aggressive while a general lack of seating remains.

A bit picked over at 1:45pm on Saturday, the Fritter gone but a dozen novel options including cake, raised and Specials all accounted for, service at Donut Bar takes a page from the youthful kids at O-Face and currently using a few staff from sunny SoCal to educate cashiers as well as customers the knowledgebase and readiness speak to experience and the Turn-Key location, though quality of the fried dough will certainly need some tweaks.

Taking the goods elsewhere to eat, conversation about everything from music to donuts and the local dining scene spanning across two-plus hours of small tastes, a first look at Donut Bar's raised options speaks of sharable portions that may help to soften the $3/each pricing and with a soft center somewhere between Brioche and Angelfood the texture shines in the setting of several glazes, classic candy bars no doubt playing a role in several of the variants.

Clearly needing some time to adjust to the desert with items featuring cocoa powder, both the triple chocolate and red velvet far too dry to be enjoyed, additional cake options were hit-and-miss in terms of consistency, the Blueberry Meyer Lemon unfortunately tasting as though it comes from the same mix sold for 69-cents elsewhere while the Girl scout themed Samoa was far more toothsome, perhaps as a result of coconut oil that several local Vegan bakers use to retain moistness in their cakes.

Not really shocking anyone with Maple Bacon Bars in 2016, the Vanilla Cream-filled Long John equally yawn inducing but more tasty overall, Cinnamon Rolls kept under warming lamps fail to hit the same highs as nearby Glutton or other artisans like Mothership or CRAFTKitchen despite a similar price per portion, the signature ""Big Poppa"" appropriately compared to ""Fair Food"" by a youngster joining in our tasting, the added jelly almost admitting that the Pop Tart alone is nothing but a gimmick and nowhere near the housemade quality of jams, creams and compotes made daily at O-Face.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Recently seeing a growth in diversity as relates to donuts, nearby Pawn Donuts and Coffee sourcing better from Donut Mania while Real Donuts on Charleston fares slightly better in texture at nearly half the price only half a mile away, one hopes that Donut Bar received a more favorable lease than that which doomed O-Face or their OC Location...or that they have some tricks besides freebies to help bolster their branding before they are too far out of the gate.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,8,3,NlhKosZDOzTw3j3hVuSKXw

And many folks know me and donuts. 

Well, even though I have 4 donuts waiting for me back at the hotel (which I have to walk back to), I figured.. What the heck. 

What discipline. After serious consideration, talking to other patrons and using the boys room.... I settled on 1 donut. It was the cream brûlée. $2

Was it worth it?  Yes. Yes it was. 

Now to roll back south. 

Happy eats. 

BTW, the other donuts I have waiting are from a very early run to Pink Box Donuts. Pretty darn good there too and at reasonable cost. I guess this is what helped me stop at 1 donut at Donut Bar. 

A wise choice. Go with the Brûlée.",IrIBmcgtpbhFm3mZAXEOEg,0,1,4,e2IGqq3jFI15wJGHIvZsTA

I've been waiting for this place to open for quite some time now. I've been stalking them on social media and you have to pay attention so you don't miss out - you snooze, you lose!

I got a few doughnuts: Caramelized Pineapple, Caramel Latte, Red Velvet, Big Poppa Tart, Samoa, Homer, Apple Fritter, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Nutella, Maple Bacon, Banana Caramel, and Cinnamon Sugar. They're most famous for Homer, Big Poppa Tart, Strawberry Split, and doughnut ice cream cones. I would have to try the Strawberry Split, Creme Brûlée, and doughnut ice cream come at a later date as they weren't available/ran out. 

But what I like the most from the ones I did get include Caramelized Pineapple, Mexican Hot Chocolate (sweet, cinnamony...then a spicy note. Yum!), Banana Caramel...Nutella was ok.

They have Stumptown coffee, puppy treats, and milk. My pup, Ralf absolutely loved the puppy cookies I got him.

Strawberry being the best by far. The blueberry was ok and the smores one was WAY too sweet, like eat one bite and get diabetes sweet.
Creme Brule is a good idea but that sugar coat on top makes for difficult chewing. 
Their apple fritter was actually pretty bad. I took a bite and threw it away, had a burnt quality to it.
Personally, I enjoy donuts with a glaze AND something on top or filled. Most of these are plain donuts with something on top. 
I wanted to love this place. I was there at their grand opening and even met the owner. But I couldn't love it, only like certain things.
That being said, their french toast donut is amazing as well as their churro donut ice cream cone. Both of those things along with their strawberry pop tart are worth it.",x-YCGHmhyq18E3F0JQUpng,0,0,3,a0nu77M3vb14BtSd2SL7Dw

5401120,2016-05-08,1,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"I woke up this morning... 7 AM... because I was going to go try The Donut Bar. There was so much hype about this place from USA today to the food network to Ellen. I was energized and ready to go!
I got there at 7:50 in the morning and it was easy to find parking. There was already a line of at least 40 people ahead of me who were also waiting for a shop that was about to open at 8 AM. The wait time to get in once the shop opens at 8 AM was 30 minutes in line outside. Luckily, it was a pleasant day. 
As I approached the inside of the store, I was surprised to see that I wasn't all that excited. I saw many very large looking donuts with hard tacky frosting that weren't at all appealing. The oversized amount made them less appealing rather than to appear yummy. The smaller donuts looked good and, by smaller, I mean normal size like Dunkin' Donuts regular donuts. 
The service was just OK. Whoever chose to run this place really doesn't seem to understand what the best environment for customer service is. It was glaring super loud music over the speakers where I could barely hear the person helping me and I'm not sure if they could hear me. I had to order several donuts for a party and thought this is a good place to try because it gets so much publicity so it has to be good. I decided to put my instincts aside because so many people were waiting in front of me and behind me to get into this place and it has gotten all these reviews.
As I ordered, after two dozen donuts, the server just went off to help somebody else without even asking me if I was finished with my order. I couldn't believe it! I was very friendly during the whole interaction which is why this shocked me. I did not bother calling her back because I am not confrontational and simply will let something like this go, but won't let it go during a review. 
The donuts range from two dollars that are very small to some pastries that are upwards of four dollars. I ordered several donuts including the Twix, Samoa, blueberry with lemon, chai, Nutella, Red velvet, and the crème brûlée. Here is what I have to say: firstly, you have to eat these donuts the day of because they are not as good the next day. With that being said, most of the donuts were not that impressive to begin with. They were just ok or disappointing. In fact, the crème brûlée donut, which gets all of this amazing hype, was one of the worst ones of the bunch. The hard sugar/Caramel crust on top of the donut was so burnt that it carried a foul aftertaste. The donut itself had a yummy crème brûlée center within the dough. The topping of the crunchy burnt sugar/Caramel ruined it. I also did not like that many of the donuts were grossly over sized with a great deal of tacky frosting on it which was glazed and dried off. I did order a couple of those and they were not very good.
This place is OK. I did not try the coffee and I wonder if that would've changed my mind and increased their ratings. The donuts are so so. They aren't that much better than other places or don't cost a lot less so I do not know what people are talking about. Also, the wait time and price just isn't worth it. It is a very popular place and a lot of people come here. Not sure if there are people that love donuts so much that this is considered great quality??? I love food and have been very fortunate to taste some phenomenal food internationally at some of the best places. I know donuts and sadly, the donut bar does not have anywhere close to the best donuts around. The two stars are because it is expensive, the service was disappointing, the wait time to get the donuts was way too long for this,and the donuts did not impress. I am glad I tried it just take the hype away and I should have gone with my instincts.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,4,1,2,tyMEn2w1UbZTYfJjqicQtg

I parked at the meters on 6th street and the walk was not bad at all. You just turn the corner and all the donuts are staring at you. You walk right in and the prices of the donuts are to your immediate right. They may have different donuts depending on the season, but majority of them are the same. They're all very delicious though! 

I just got a variety of donuts, choosing the ones that looked good. You NEED to get the Birthday Cake donut with an surprise Oreo inside. I was so excited for it.

So the donuts look appealing, several large donuts, glazed, chocolate, Nutella. These are twice the size of regular donuts. Today, the large glazed was a little under cooked for me. It was doughy, when pulling apart, the pieces could be rolled into an almost raw like consistency. I don't care for that. 

The old fashion was too dried out, dry and stale. They pulled it from a large tray but I don't know how long they where sitting out, but just to dry for me. 

Got two of the cream brûlée, good donut with hard glaze on top stuffed with cream filling. Tasted like vanilla pudding instead of real cream. Not bad for what it was. 

Next thing that we tried was the Boston cream bars. They where good, love the chocolate glaze, again the vanilla pudding cream taste and not truly the real cream flavor.

The creme.brulee is a vegan donut that has a candy like carmelized consistency on top of it with a vegan made custard in that sucker. It's my fave out of all the donuts! For some reason when I bite into it-it reminds me of a Filipino dessert. Sometimes the top may taste a bit burnt minus it actually being burnt. You'll know what I mean when you try it. 

Weekends they give away free themed donuts to the kiddos. Nothing like seeing your 3 year old elated to bite into an angry bird, minion, or even an avenger. But nothing like imagining a parents face knowing your child is about to bite into his last chunk of sugar for the month. Lol.

I'm afraid to admit I've tried a lot of the stuff they have to offer and overall, think they're all right. Nothing worth setting your alarm to, although, coming in early would be ideal because duh...the fresher the better. Everyone knows going to any kind of bakery towards closing won't get the best bite. 

The big poppa tart donut they're raved about or known for is all right...says the person who can tolerate only so little sugar in one sitting. The one I've had was actually dry. =/ 

Overall, I'd still pop in on a Saturday morning with the fam...take our our donuts then walk over to the container park where the kids can release the sugar they just swallowed. Makes for a nice morning with the fam. It's worth giving it a try. I prefer this spot over Pink Box for sure...mainly because of their vegan.

I dont think theyre one of those must cross the desert for. If you happen to be by and feel like a donut, then definitely give them a try. But if youre coming without a donut craving at all, then more than likely you'll find them to be all right and overhyped.

Long lines some mornings. I'd skip bringing the stroller in if possible. But if you must...then you must...especially if you're in then out. Their strawberry milk on tap was pretty deelish too!

And something I've learned...these donuts have beers out there that pair really well together. Mind blown.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,1,1,4,MXfa56wr_dQiIZjq22ayyg

The glazed sugar on top gives a perfectly satisfactory crack when hit and/or when bitten into and the filling was delicious. 

We purposefully visited on the weekend for the expanded menu and, of the specials, chose the French toast donut which did not disappoint. We'll try the grilled cheese on a later visit. I suggest you do the same. (Or take enough people that you can order all the donuts and do a sampling.)

I've heard people say it is the old location of O-face donuts? Not positive about this because I never went to O-face. Anyways the original location of Donut Bar is from San Diego, really glad they brought  it to downtown Las Vegas. 

 I have to say I was pretty impressed, they had Stumptown coffee! I am a bit of a coffee snob and Stumptown coffee has got to be my favorite. They serve Stumptown at the famous Voodoo Doughnuts in Seattle/Portland area to give you a better idea of how serious this coffee is. The outdoor patio seating behind Donut bar is also on point! Very spacious and surrounded by artwork. However, the customer service was a bit lacking to me. I felt pretty rushed to order by the girl behind the counter. She almost seemed annoyed that we didn't automatically know what we wanted to order. 

Pros: vegan options, outdoor patio seating, Stumptown coffee, cool bathroom decor, amazing coffee selection (nitro cold brew coffee on tap), location 

Cons: Small space (wouldn't like dining inside), really loud music for early morning, close at 1 pm or until all sold out, have to pay for parking (only a $1 but still), customer service 

Vegan donuts you must try: Banana Caramel, Strawberry split, Creme Brule

My fiancé and I are getting married in exactly 2 weeks and wanted to have Donut Bar cater a section with donuts in Las Vegas. She had emailed them in the beginning of the year and didn't get a response. I had to stop there when I was in Las Vegas to personally get information about what we wanted. They took my information and then I followed up with them to get the figures. After getting that squared away I was told to get them paid for about 2-3 weeks prior to the event. I emailed them to have someone call me to take payment, no response, then called today to give them my card and the person on the phone was authorized to do so and he person that was wasn't available for about 3 hours. I left my name and number for them to call me back and never did. By far the worst customer service I've seen in a while when a person is trying to ""give"" you money.

5653551,2016-05-02,3,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"So, with this place receiving so much fanfare I had to stop in and see what all the fuss was about. I arrived when almost all the donuts were gone but still managed to score a dozen with the help of my good friend. We walked right in and were greeted by the friendly and fun staff. We viewed the menu for the day and could not believe the variety of donuts. There were at least  20+ flavors to choose from and this included vegan choices which I can totally get behind. These aren't just donuts, some were like mini cakes and were almost big enough to cover your whole face (No Joke)!  I had never seen such large donuts before and could not believe how creative these people are with the large variety of choices. We managed to score some delicious options, such as the Strawberry Split, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Blood Orange, Boston Creme, The Oreo Donut (with an Oreo inside) and a couple of creme brûlée'. My favorite donut from this batch was the Boston Creme. The creme oozes with flavor and tasted heavenly. The donut itself was moist and fresh. The creme was so rich that I found it a little overwhelming to eat in one sitting so I ate half the first day and finished it off the second day. Yeah, it was rough....

 The Strawberry Split was layered with fresh strawberries and whipped creme in the middle of a large sugar donut. A different take on the strawberry short cake and perhaps a step up. I almost added a small drizzle of chocolate since I had it for dessert that night. I shared the other donuts with my staff and family and they were all very complimentary.  My daughter really liked the Oreo Donut and was surprised when she found the cookie in the middle. The service was outstanding and so friendly. The shop is quaint and very clean with not a whole lot of room and it makes this place nice and cozy. They also have a new t- shirt for advertising that is available for purchase. It has a great color scheme and it gives a shout out to our city! I can hardly wait to go back early in the morning when the donuts are fresh out of the fryer.

5672010,2017-01-13,1,v_yCY6NCwxCPIsNZR80UfQ,"Hello, My name is Scott Bianchi, and I have a donut problem. 

     I'm a huge fan of the Donut Bar in San Diego. They have great donuts, they have great people. It's a good place. When I heard they were opening a store in Las Vegas, I was jealous of Las Vegas. They're supposed to open a store in Santa Clarita. However, when I suddenly planned a trip out to Las Vegas, I knew a stop here was primary on my list.
     Saturday morning I woke up early. Having been to the San Diego location, I know there's a line a block and a half long Saturday mornings.  However, when my WAZE lady told me I had arrived at the Las Vegas store, there was no huge line. There wasn't even people out the door. It seemed fairly quiet. There was also a parking issue. 
     The lot directly across the street has signage all over it saying 'permit required' and 'we will tow your car' so when I parked in it initially, I was a bit concerned for my ride. I poked my head in the door of the Donut shop, and asked about it. The nice guy behind the counter said that the lot didn't belong to them, but there was free parking on sixth street on the weekend. So I ran back out, and relocated my car to the warm and fuzzy, safe free parking area just down the street. I then returned, knowing that I could sit for a lil while and have my ride be there when I left.
     I entered the shop, and the familiar donuts smiled up at me from their case. They were holiday decorated even. I walked down the case and picked out four donuts.  I was going to stop at three, but then the rudolph donut just had to go along too. So, I paid for the four donuts (ended up at about twenty dollars) I then sat down to admire the donuts, and the fish tank from the fish tank tv show when I heard somebody order a french toast donut.
    ""French toast donut?"" I asked, still composing my yelp photo.
    ""Yes, we have them on Saturdays and Sundays...""
    ""I loooove the french toast donuts. I want one.""
    ""Excellent!""
   I paid for a french toast donut, and sadly put the lid back onto the box of donuts I had. I sipped on the juice I had also paid for. After a lil while, another donut box was brought out. This one had a plate and containers inside. Atop the plate was a french toast donut. In the containers were toppings. One had maple butter, one had jam, and the third had maple syrup. 
     I've never been a syrup kinda guy, so I put that one aside. The butter I smeared on top of the donut, and the jam I also used. There was also a plastic fork and knife wrapped up in a napkin. I used them to surgically cut apart my breakfast and enjoy it as long as I could. It was good. After this french toast donut, I was actually pretty full. So I thanked the store for their tasty treats, and walked back to my car.
     
    It turns out they're a just block away from old Fremont street. So knowing my car was in a safe spot, I spent several hours wandering the area. Lots of very neat things to see right around here. Including 'old' Las Vegas, and container park with their colossal mantis. (Just in case you're looking for things to do around here)

   The four donuts actually went home with me. They were still tasty and fresh when I got home the following day.",43WiflwfTbmjizIfxvQ_jw,1,1,5,U0V9TDr_3W8wmmaRKlSnvQ

Went on Sunday 5-1-16 at 11:30AM to grab some donuts.  I ordered four donuts.  Don't judge me.  For $16 we got four donuts and two drip coffees.  

$4.00 ""big poppa tart"" is a ginormous donut which looks like a poptart on the top.  You need a fork and knife for this!  It's kinda greasy but fluffy and filled with a generic cheap-tasting  jam.  

$3.00 ""DB's nutella donut"" is a standard donut with chocolate on top and what I think was crushed nuts.  It was fluffy, huge, and nicely yeasty.  It didn't taste much like Nutella to me. 

$4.00 ""strawberry split"" is a huge donut dusted in sugar, split down the middle, and filled with cream and fresh strawberries.  The donut itself was kinda boring but the strawberries were ripe and juicy.  The cream they use is the super-white kind that never melts....kinda like the type they use on the desserts at Golden Corral.  It doesn't taste good and I'm sure it's not good for you.  I'd pass on this one next time, even though it's very pretty.  

$3.00 ""Pb & J"" is a vegan jelly-filled donut with peanut butter glaze on top.  My husband really liked this one.  

They gave my son a free donut...it was a round one with a red face on it...maybe it's a character from a cartoon or something?  I'm not sure cuz' my son is two and hasn't started watching TV yet.  It was a very nice gesture on their part!

We both got drip coffees which were actually good but they only had regular sugar, sugar in the raw, and stevia.  Gimme some splenda or nutrasweet, ya hippies!!!  Let me kill myself slowly with artificial sweeteners.  

Usually donuts give me heartburn but I felt fine all day after gorging myself on these donuts.  I'll be back to try the creme brulee donut!  This place will definitely do well because they are catering to the hipster vegans and they have unique donuts. 

I had a lot of leftovers since the donuts are so big but they ended up in the trash...which means they weren't very good because I will gladly eat a krispy kreme donut that is 4 days old that i found on the ground somewhere.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,19,15,3,3MW00wWmzqYZvJ6sdUshMw

When I heard San Diego's Donut Bar set up a location in Vegas, I just had to have it again. In SD, I had the Strawberry Split (an unforgettable fruity donut stuffed with whipped cream, $4) and I was pleased to see it again here in Vegas. But on this trip I had to try something new.

On this Saturday morning we got there pretty late, around 10:30am, and it seemed like a lot had already been sold.  Of what remained, I had two donuts: Creme Brûlée ($2) & the Twix donut ($2).

I gotta say, both Donuts were unlike anything I've ever had before. The brûlée had a sweet sticky crunch layer of molten sugar and filled on the inside with sweet cream. I knew going into the Twix I would be smacked with an explosion of chocolate and it did not disappoint - Twix bar crumbs covered the top layer of thick chocolate dressing on chocolate dough.  Amazing!

For your coffee craving, there're several options to choose: espresso, mocha, chai latte, drip, etc.  I had the Americano - a super smooth black coffee.

I believe between four friends, we ordered to our hearts content (which ended up being 8 donuts and about $35, including chocolate milk for all). They supposedly have homemade strawberry milk on tap but I have my doubts since they were sold out the last two times I tried to stop in. (Maybe the trick is to go early? But how do I know the strawberry milk is worth getting up at 7am???)

In any case, the donuts were magic. I highly recommend the creme brûlée donut since it was one of the more unique ones we had. Personally, not my favorite. The caramelization on top tasted more like honey to me than anything else but I still recommend giving it a go since I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. Also the big poppa tart donuts are INSANE. Way too much volume for my belly. It was tasty but hard to enjoy such a monstrosity. I ended up taking two-thirds of it home. We also tried the strawberry split though I wasn't all that impressed. It's a sugar donut with whipped cream and strawberries in it.. plain and simple. There are definitely better options here, in my opinion..

If I were to offer a few pieces of advice: stick to the classics (they do their simple donuts very VERY well) and GO EARLY TO GET THE STRAWBERRY MILK. I think it's one of those mystical menu items that may or may not exist in real life.. hmm...",2PpCp3l1c_yzcY236ptEKg,1,2,4,DkEEQ74uOPIN6jOaCrzUyg

Its basically an assembly line of donuts.. pick your size box.. walk down the line and pick donuts to go inside box. Employees are always great to share their favoriets and try and squeeze one more donut in the box without smashing everything. 

The day I was here it was Friday afternoon and since it was towards the afternoon they offered my $10 box of donuts as many as I could fit in the box. I walked away with some bacon donuts, PopTart Donuts and some other great fancy items for sure.

Love that its in downtown Vegas and even if its a drive from my house, its certainly worth the drive and time. 
They also serve coffee drinks and has a small seating area.

Getting there early one is greeted by rows of elegant looking donuts with creative names and flavors and a helpful staff.  Donuts aren't cheap but not as expensive as some have complained about ($5.00 for 2 - what do you expect for the ""Best Donuts In the World"").  I opted for a creme brulee donut for the BF and a (huge) Mud Pie one for me.  My friend got a Boston Creme for herself. 

As soon as she took a bite of the Boston Creme I knew this was not the ""Best Donut In The World"" entirely too doughy not enough creme.  Creme didn't go all the way through the bar. 

My Mud Pie tasted like a donut with chocolate sprinkles.  Fancy name for a less than average donut.  Again the thing was HUGE which meant a lot of dough for not nearly enough topping.  I ate about half and got bored (BORED! With a donut!!!)

The BF's review was the worst.  He took one bite and said it was the worst donut he'd ever had and that the cooking oil needed to be changed (he works in the food industry and I don't so he is more aware of such things).  He refused to eat any more (however, helpfully offered me a bite - which I declined).  He puts the creme brulee as ""worse than Dunkin' Donuts"" which is about as low as it goes in his book. 

Maybe I don't have the refined donut palette of some of the other clientele, maybe I'm just looking for something different in my breakfast pastries.  But I will skip this one next time.",iDQQ2D4gGkQaflO4ZDup1g,0,0,2,H8jxUmBkaTrNoUK6NHyapw

So today I decided to drive from the other side of town to get some more of their donuts cause I enjoyed them so much the first time. Well I got there, first off the building is way to small they need to have a bigger space to walk. People kept running into each to get to the line or from the line to check out. Second off we were waiting in line and no one was helping us it seemed to be they were helping everyone around us, including the people that were behind us. Finally I had to ask someone to help us. Third after I had gotten home I dug into the donuts and they weren't as good. I had bought some that I knew were good from my previous experience at downtown summerlin and some new ones to try. I had gotten a maple bar, how can someone mess up on a maple bar? Honestly their donuts need more flavor.

I dare say Donut Bar actually makes my top 3 donut places in North America too!  (The other two being Blue Star donuts in Portland and Cartems Donuterie in Vancouver Canada)

Why is Donut Bar so darn good?

Donut standards keep going up, and these days, you can't just have a good donut.  You need something that stands out to make your donut shop - 'worth a journey'.  At Donut bar, they've got TWO things that I gladly journey out for - their ice cream donut, and their creme brulee donut.  That's not even mentioning their other donuts (strawberry, vanilla bean, maple bacon) that are full of flavourful donuty goodness and excellent in their own right.  

Unlike Pinkbox, Donut bar closes when they run out of donuts.  That's usually around noon?  Depending on how picky you are about your donut options, come early.  They only make about 25 of their ice cream donuts every day, and they usually aim to have those ready by 10.  I know eating an ice cream cone at 10am in the morning feels a little strange, but it was worth it for me.

I haven't had their horchata donut, but I've seen photos -- looks pretty amazing.  As soon as I lose my donut weight I'm going right back to hunt for this donut!",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,2,2,5,eb8jzSqlVSz5zoYao48sQg

They were one of my favorites while in San Diego, so for me, the fact that they took over where O-face used to be is a straight up upgrade.

They are also very community oriented and are always doing things hat put them out there so that people can put a face to the names. They were absolute life savers at Life Is Beautiful. They are also super cool because they post their menu for the next day on all their social media, so you know if your favorite donut is gonna be there and you don't have to guess. My only gripe is that they open relatively late for a donut place at 7am and it's super cool that they are open until sold out.

Depending on the type you get, you're definitely in for a sugar rush! These donuts are definitely too pretty to eat, but I'm happy to accept that challenge. I've tried a variety of them and the only one I don't think I'll be trying and kind of disappointed about is the Mexican Hot Chocolate (i think its called). All others are very worth the hour I waited in line and 5 blocks I walked yesterday due to the walk-a-thon happening in downtown LV. You should also try their house made strawberry milk. Soo smooth and soo good!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,3,2,5,ab95yEYpFK_6a147CfFYaQ

At 9am on a Thursday, my friend and I decided to check out Donut Bar. There was no line! 

The photos don't do the donut size justice. The large ones are truly huge and easily split-able, which is great for trying multiple with friends.

I tasted 3 ""small"" donuts: toasted coconut, creme brule, and nutella explosion. They were all great - loved their consistency and Donut Bar's playfulness with the decorations.

To top it office, the prices were great! Totally reasonable for a ""craze"" food, quality, and quantity.

What a food adventure! Definitely check this spot out.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,7,8,5,QK9DlIs6yPQZqQns-FRT5w

My favorites were the maple bacon donut with super good chewy dough in the middle, and the churro cone soft serve ice cream.  These two items were incredibly orgasmic.  

Do yourself a favor and go to Vegas for this.  Do it now.  Please.",p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ,1,4,5,5iXX_d3WQ9UdUOwvPHmelw
