The quality of beef paired with the perfect combination of condiments makes fat burger a necessity on every Vegas trip.  I suggest at least a double burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It's my belief that lettuce has no business on a burger but get it with everything else.

1.Walked in for breakfast. Saw an employee sitting at a booth eating McDonald's breakfast.  See four other employees standing doing nothing.
 
2.Looked at menu and ordered breakfast burrito and side of ham steak, listed on menu for 3 dollars. 
 
3.Told they don't carry ham steak. 
 
4.Change it to bacon. Ask about what the ""bread basket"" for 10dollars is.  Told they only have English muffins now. The rest didn't sell we'll. 
 
5.Finish order and choose to eat outside. Proceed to walk past the employee sitting at the bar drinking beer and watching basketball. 
 
6.Wait for 20 minutes for my breakfast burrito. 
 
7.Look around at the restaurant where no food is being delivered during the 20 minutes. 

8.Begin to breathe smoke as employee drinking beer at bar decides to light up cigarette. 
 
9.Wait 15 more minutes for food, only being asked how I'm doing once. 
 
10.Get food, which was fine. Just ok. 
 
11.Watch another employee behind bar texting her BFF or something. Had to get up and ask for silverware. Was pointed to where I could get it myself. 
 
12.Finished food, getting asked by what looked like the janitor (he had been cleaning the metal around the bar, sweeping, etc.) how my meal was. Was tempted to leave him the tip instead. 
 
13.Walked out without tipping and wrote yelp review, then wrote fat burger Vegas off my list.

For some reason this location just misses the point! Now, I understand it is in a high volume area, with heavy foot traffic and etc. Catering to tourist who probably will not come back, but regardless of who comes into eat, Consistency & Quality is key!  

Meat-overcooked
Bun-A little stale
Produce-Not very fresh-BK & Mr. Jack-had better. 
Extra items?-Actually paid extra for something I didn't get! I know stupid me! 
Overpriced food, drinks, and etc.

Please note that this review was done after an all night drinking bender. 

When you stroll into fat burger, its like visiting an old school hamburger place. All the food is cooked to order and they make no attempt to disguise what there selling you....from fat fries to a fat drink, you know that whatever you consume will have enough fat to kill a rhino.

But as with most things in life even though its terrible for you, its delicious. The wait time kind of sucks, but the wait is worth getting something that doesn't resemble a hockey puck a la McDonald's. 
Its also a little on the expensive side with two meals running me about $27 bucks, which for a burger and fries is a little much.

I went for the self-seating outdoor bar, famished after a long night.  A quick check of the reviews said that largest size - XXXL - was almost unfinishable due to the size, so I ordered the XXL.  With no bun (paleo!).  And a fried egg.  And bacon.  Because it was technically breakfast.  

There is a bit of a wait, but it was bearable - large burgers grilled to order take a bit of time.

What came out was two huge patties, with the cheese, bacon and egg layered on top, resting on some greens, onions and tomatoes on the side.  Although it looked dry, it was juicy and flavorful.  The egg was cooked to over-hard, which was fine.  The bacon was just okay.  I knife and forked it easily (much easier to eat than In-N-Out's Protein style order).  I finished it all, but it was a lot of food - a very fat burger indeed.

The outdoor seating is enjoyable, more so for the view of the tvs by the bar, and the comely staff.  The people watching is a bit muted, from our time there.  Service is attentive.

The burgers are AWESOME, especially for a fast food joint.  I used to think In-And-Out was the hidden fast food burger gem on the west coast...but Fatburger passed them up!  
Fast forward to last week.  I was back in Vegas with a few friends and one of my friends had a Triple King Burger (three 1/2 pound patties).  If you finish this monstrosity, they give you a free t-shirt and take your picture to put up on the wall.  He finished it and got his picture taken.  They were out of t-shirts though.  
A few nights later, we went back.  I ordered a QUAD King Burger (trip-King + 1 extra patty) to one-up my friend.  After consuming TWO POUNDS of delicious hamburger, I instantly regretted my decision.  The burger was awesome (as usual), but I was disgustingly full.  They were still out of t-shirts, and their camera was broken too, but I didn't care.  Right after we left, one of the cooks came outside after me to shake my hand.

Went here a couple of time during our 2 week holiday in Vegas and couldn't fault it.

Chips/fries are great and the oreo milkshake. Only thing is they asked me first time if I wanted whipped cream on top to which I said no, but did't get asked second time. Didn't think anything of it unitl it arrived with a load of cream on top. yikes, not a fan of cream! 

I'm just gutted we couldn't find it on our first night! I had read it was behind the MGM, which it really isn't! So went off in the direction of Hooters looking for it (obviously wrong way!).

The husband and I went last week to this one on the strip, I always get the medium burger with cheese, fat fries and a soda.  It does take a few minutes to get your food since it is cooked to order.  The staff here are always friendly and the food is always good.  It is super unhealthy, but damn, it's a good burger.

The restaurant is not the cleanest, as it is right on the strip and I think does a fair amount of business, but if you can get over that it's fine.

The biggest reason is because it took them 30 freaking minutes to cook a freaking Baby Fat burger. Yep, a fast food restaurant actually beating a fine dining restaurant when it comes to serving! And no, it was not as if they were crowded. There were, believe it or not, just 4, FOUR people on the line. The poor guy in front of me had to wait 15 minutes just to be served up his soda. Oh man, it was so sad I almost laugh. And those clueless idiots (Pardon me) keep asking our orders for probably 5-6 times throughout the 30-minute torture.

The burger itself isn't that great, and is overpriced like hell. It was overcooked, dry and not juicy at all. And I finished a $3.50 burger with just 3-4 bites. Wew.

Mt husband ordered a fat king burger with egg and since I was not hungry I decided not to place an order. 

There was not very many people in the restaurant but it did take a little while for the food because the food is made to order. 

While we were waiting we met a very nice lady from Utah who was with her family. 

It is the typical fast food burger joint that has a lot a kids working.

Its true the burger here are delicious - the condiments were generously piled onto the burger, and it was so perfectly wrapped (yes, the ocd side of me lights up at things like this). The fries are some of the most delicious fries ever.  I just had some, and I kind of want some more already.  They're so perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside without satisfying any of the soft interior (I'm referring to the skinny fries).

However, minus 1 star because I have to say that it unfortunately reminds me greatly of another burger joint that I love much more (rhymes with mud suckers).  I know it's not fatburgers fault, but it is unfortunate that the burger reminds me too much of another (better) one I've already tried.  Please save the hate mail, loyal fatburger fans.. this is my personal and honest opinion.

Minus another star because I asked for mayo on the side and I found my burger fully dressed with mayo in my burger.  I could have let it slide, but my friend also asked for a burger without some of the condiments, and unfortunately his burger also came as if he has asked for a burger with everything.

I will recommend this place though - if you're in the area.

I'm currently comparing this to In N Out.  I'm from Florida, so we don't have Fatburger or In N Out, which is why I had to get both on my trip here (I'll try Shake Shack tomorrow).  First disclaimer, I love In N Out, so this would have had to be pretty darn good to beat that.  Unfortunately, it did not live up and it even somewhat disappointed.

First the good, the burger meat is solid.  I got the turkey burger, sans bun, with cheese, and it was delicious.  The shake is also pretty good.  It had a huge heaping of whipped cream on the top that I enjoyed.

The bad, the price is insane.  I got a turkey burger, chili cheese fries, and a milkshake.  Total was $20.  At In N Out, that same meal is $10.  I don't know if it is more expensive, since I'm in vegas, but holy cow.  Also, I was not impressed with the fries.  They were definitely not worth the calories.  I got the skinny fries and ended up throwing them out.  With In N Out I'm scrapping the bottom of everything to get the last remnants of cheese.  This cheese was just meh.

So overall, I wouldn't suggest wasting your calories or your money on this place.  But, then again, when you're drunk this place is probably heaven.",-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ,2,1,2,hlaypAgqEm1dW3XFOURxIg

Tattoo parlors, porn slappers galore, bums cursing at you for not smiling (really?), those creepy statue people, some lady at a stall trying to sell a towel that wraps around a woman's waist (reallyx2?), some dude with a shirt that has LEDs on it (kinda like an updated bedazzle), and another dude trying to get me to go to the Grand Canyon.  They will ask me ""you wanna go to the Grand Canyon?""  The best thing to do is to reply with a ""you wanna go to [insert horrible city here]?""  I usually use Port Arthur, TX.  This area of the strip reminds me of the part of the Thriller video where the zombies come out of nowhere and scare the hell out of the girl...then MJ turns into a zombie for some reason....everybody dances and things get annoying.

Ordered their large 8oz burger with the works, cheese, fried egg and bacon with a side of fries.

When we got there, at the entrance some guy passing out cards, gave us a BOGO drink coupon each for this place. Then we sat and waited. They don't have enough servers, and we were hungry. It was nice out, so we sat outside. 

Finally a pleasant server came and took our orders and honored our fresh BOGO cards, score! Then we waited. Finally our drinks arrived, nothing special just a draft beer, but something to keep us company while yet again waiting. 

Our burgers arrived, and I must say they are huge! I got a 1/3 pounder and one of my friends got the 1/2 pounder! It's not cheap, but for the size of this masterpiece I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, and filling. Didn't feel like I had to eat again for 4-6 hours later. 

Overall the burgers we all agreed were excellent in taste, freshness, and ability to fill you up. The restaurant itself was kind of dirty because they didn't clear tables quick so it would blow on the ground. The wait was something not everyone would tolerate so well, but if you want a good burger and don't want to break the bank, this is a great spot for that.",_UsSJFj7phfzoKQfzbnV6A,0,0,4,8gILsV1S1KWzDQqg1VsHXA

I was hopeful that Fatburger would live up to the hype and give my beloved In-And-Out burger a run for it's money. Sadly, I wasn't horribly impressed. 

I went for the small cheeseburger and split and order of fries with friends. While the burger was definitely better than McDonald's or Wendy's or something, it wasn't amazingly life changing.

1585101,2008-11-10,2,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"Gluttony at its finest. This account is from my first and final trip to Fat Burger on the LV strip.

The second night of the girls' 21st birthday trip to Vegas was supposed to be our night to party hardy. Fat Burger brought all that to an abrupt halt. We spent the day at the Mandalay Beach, sun bathing and sipping on Long Islands and planning our evening. We then ate at Raffles cafe, drank some more, went to the room and cleaned up, drank some more, then hit up the Vodka Vault at Red Square, Ghostbar, Moon and Playboy and drank at each of those along the way. What... we were thirsty?

Hungry and desperate, we decide to get a snack before heading to the next clubs we had planned on, Tryst and Drais. Fat Burger put a halt on those plans because Tryst was scratched altogether and only half of us even made it to Drais.

Mistake: two of the four BZs ordered burgers bigger than they could handle.

Result: instant food coma, cranky and bitchyness. The two wanted to go home an sleep, thus foiling our big late night plans (now that our taxi rides would cost double and the fact I had to give some creepy promoter my cell phone number, for the greater good of the group, to get free guestlist at Tryst).

The service was S L O W, albeit, a lot of drunk people were there just around 12 midnight and the cooks were probably backed up a little. We had eaten probably 6 hours earlier so we needed to refuel. We must've waited at least 20 minutes for our orders.

OK, not so bad right? Wrong. One of the girls had severe implications from the FAT burger for the remainder of the weekend into Tuesday.... savage diarrhea and constipation. Trust, though it wasn't ME, we all had to suffer because she was queasy and cranky and was blowing up our hotel room's toilet at all times we were in the room. And boy, that bathroom door was paper-thin because we could hear it all. But we wont go there.

Fat Burger, thanks for being there, but never again. I'll stick with what I know and go to In-n-Out.",4pzr6KuS85859EICMI7MDw,2,2,2,MdQHWj3AgI2anvctCjutOQ

I ordered a turkey cheeseburger because I'm not a fan of red meat. But if no one told me it was turkey, I'd swear I was eating ground beef. It was super juicy and the burger had all the grease residuals from the stove. I got mine sans mustard, pickles, and relish because those are not my friends. Still with all the other toppings (lettuce, tomato, mayo, raw onions) my burger was pretty tall. It also came in a toasted wheat bun. Did I mention, the burger was as big as my face?

Fatburger also offers skinny fries and fat fries. You can get them with cheese or chili cheese. Everything on the menu looks super good but the burger was enough to fill me up.

Perhaps it's sprinkled with a ghetto-fabulous dust that has the same addictive qualities as coke (I believe this dust is sodium and lard-based).

For the two of us, we ordered about 60 dollars worth of food. The food isn't good, but if you feel the craving of a pregnant lady itching inside you for fried and greasy food that will probably dissipate the moment holy water ever touched it, this is your place. 

We went around 3am and it was still open, so yay for the hours.

I got some oreo shake concoction, and it was so thick that when I turned my cup upside-down, the shake was still in place; not one drop leaked out of the cup.

We ordered the chicken burger, 2 other burgers with assorted toppings, hotdog, chili fries, onion rings, beer (from outside), and the shake. After all, we had a checklist for things to do while in Vegas, and our list was basically a list of the 7 sins. Gluttony, check.

This location is on the Strip, near the Hawaiian Marketplace. You'll pretty need to park elsewhere and walk here. There's an inside area and an outside area. Since people-watching on the Strip is a fav pastime of my mine, we opted for outside.

The outside space is a circular bar with bar seating and then several high-tops. It's a seat yourself place. Unlike other Fatburger locations, this one has waitresses. So when you sit outside, a server will come and take your order, bring you your food, and bring you a check.

Also unlike other Fatburger locations, since this one has a bar, you can get beer and mixed drinks. There's also a slushie stand where you can purchase those crazy yard-long tourist concoctions.

The service isn't much, but that's kinda to be expected.

Dirty on the outside and horribly crowded on the inside. You'll see all sorts of people in the inside from the business professional to the dirty street hookers. What's important is that they're actually pretty well behaved since they've all walked off the alcohol I guess. This place is crowded as hell and it will take you a while to get your food.

I ordered the king burger and a peanut butter shake and ate it all. The food was great but the waitline was just way way too long.

2359015,2010-11-03,18,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"Fatburger is the African-American version of Johnny Rocket's.

In order to create a Fatburger, you take the Johnny Rocket's old school diner feel and replace the Elvis, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis with the Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and the Jackson 5. The music here has me ""all shook up,"" but it has my, ""r-e-s-p-e-c-t."" I love it.

Fatburger also takes the complicated Johnny Rocket's menu, eliminates 75 percent of it, and makes you focus on how you want your burger and what kind of fries you want. Ordering is like, ""A-B-C, easy as 1-2-3.""

You first pick the size of your burger. By size, it means in terms of patty size (2.5, 5.3, 8, 16, and 24 ounces). I am not sure who can eat a 2 pound burger, but until I weigh 400 pounds or I am high on government grade grass, I'll stick to the 5.3 ounce patty. Plus, there's only so much meat I can fit in my mouth.

You then pick the toppings. The burgers come loaded with fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles (unless you say otherwise), but you get to add to your ""Fatburger"" experience with four extra toppings: cheese, bacon, chili, and/or an egg. Personally, I always roll with cheese and bacon. But under the influence of Las Vegas, I have added chili and an egg and it while it was different, it was still delicious. Yum. Burp. Fart.

If you want fries, you get two options: skinny fries or fat fries. The former is thin and crispy, and the latter are more like steak fries. Honestly, they are both really good. This is like having to choose between Betty and Veronica. And just like Archie, I can't truly commit to either option. 

So I pick one or the other on each visit, but never both at the same time. You have to keep your options open and never let them know you are savoring both. Now that's ""true playa"" status, right there. Ya feel me?

Also, the milk shakes shakes are wonderful. You have try one at least once. They have five different flavors: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, Maui-Banana, and Oreo Cookies & Cream. You can't go wrong with either, but I suggest the vanilla, strawberry, and cookies & cream options. They are just so thick and creamy. That's what she said.

In addition to all of this, the service is stellar. But since it's set up is not a sit down restaurant, you don't need to tip. I guess Fatburger eliminated the tipping from Johnny Rocket's too. So you are left with great burgers, at a good price, in a cool environment.

Needles to say, I'm a fan of the African-American Johnny Rockets: Fatburger.",0kSXMbNFo7mdwTPj4iQv9A,17,15,4,CLQbemxC4DS-8Pc3WqpizA

One of my friends suggested, ""I hear they're pretty good.""
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.",8Aq_UdlsrjhBwGWb_U-xRA,24,21,2,SP8Cv4S9nXkiHOgJLuUKEA

2520725,2007-07-17,2,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"I never thought I would enjoy Fatburger, because I typically am not a fan of the type of hamburger that is taller than it is wide, where you bite into it and about a pound and a half of condiments dump into your lap.  That's why in the eternal war of In-n-Out vs. Fatburger, I would take In-n-Out.

But for whatever reason, I really do like this particular giganto-burger.  There is the kitsch of the classic hamburger stand, the chrome signs and lineage behind the thing.  Add to that a very simple menu with lots of choices for your made-to-order burger.  And the ingredients are generally very fresh.  Some combination of that makes a burger that is a great experience, instead of just a placeholder next to a mess of fries.

This particular Fatburger is very hit or miss as for service times.  You can go in at three or four in the afternoon, or very late at night, and get your food in no time and find many places to sit.  Or you can go right at noon and be monumentally screwed.  This place doesn't scale well, so you might have to give up and move on to something else if you hit a rush hour.

I would put them above most fast food spots, but I don't think they top in n out.  I love the fact that you can get steak fries (the best choice), but the regular fries are better than average as well.  Generally you have to decide how much meat you want and that will determine the cost and size of your burger (they also have some other meat choices as well).  They have other toppings too, which actually makes their burgers somewhat customizable.  I seem to remember even getting asked what type of cheese I wanted?!?!? Bring on the cheese choice revolution.
I found the prices reasonable for LV strip, and the wait (at 1:00p on a weekday) was about 25 minutes.  Don't expect a seat though, as the dining area was pretty crowded the whole time I was there and it almost certainly is worse at night.
I didn't find the staff to be *fun* like other reviewers did, but they were certainly doing their job and that is all I really ask of anybody.

This place is SO ghetto, which is funny as all hell since it's next door to the MGM Grand. In classic Vegas style, this location has a nifty neon sign, and is open 24 hours.

When we walked in, I couldn't help but snap shots of the interior. A gaggle of transvestites were carrying on and one noticed me, thinking I was trying to photograph them. I assured her/him I was really taking photos of the establishment.

I shared a turkey burger ($5) with my friend which wasn't bad, to start. I took a bite, chewed thoughtfully, took a few notes, then proceeded to douse mine in Tabasco.

I would have never payed this bill obviously but the security and bartenders bullied me into paying the entire 166 dollar bill. They threatened me to the point I had to pay the bill or I was gonna get beaten up. I feared for my own well being which is insane to me because all we wanted to do was get some food before bed.

At places like these, I like to order my burger with basic toppings like lettuce and tomato and no sauces or cheese so I can see how the burger itself tastes. Mine was overcooked, the edges fell off from being poorly made, and it was too salty. If you're here with a larger group, remember what you ordered. When the food comes out, the server will have all the burgers on one tray and all the sides on another, as opposed to serving each person what they ordered individually.

The big draw is the size of the burgers, hence the name. You can get something as small as 2.5 oz. to as big as 16-24 oz. (2 or 3 of their eight ounce patties) If you have a big appetite and money to spare you won't leave here hungry. The meat itself tasted bland, though, and lacked flavor. I wanted to like it, but there was just something missing.

Even the fries were OK at best. There is something cool about them, though - you can get them in three different styles - skinny (shoestring), fat (almost steak-fry like) and in a sweet potato variety. So there's something for everyone here.

First off, it's a Fatburger with a bar -- an outdoor bar. I would have never guessed you could get fat AND drunk here.

Secondly, the burgers here are massive and come in four sizes: L, XL, XXL, and XXXL. I had the XXL, which was $11 without a drink and fries -- if you want a small combo, you'll have to pay an additional $6 for that. I guess rent here is that ridiculous. They even have a food challenge here. I can't remember the deets, but the XXL was large enough for me. I couldn't take on the XXXXL (or whatever it was) Challenge.

The meat was nice and juicy and flavorful, something we don't see much in Ohio with burger chains. As I suggested earlier, everything is MASSIVE. One burger and a cup for tap water should be enough, but if you insist on the fries keep in mind that your wallet is going to feel much lighter after you eat. With many burgers this size, I think to myself ""do I have to finish this?"", but not here.

We had ordered one portion of the thick fries and one of the thin fries. The thin fries were a little cold but this cannot be helped. The food tasted great and we both left feeling full and not over stuffed. If we visit Vegas again we will deffo use this burger joint again.,7_IG9hLjMDd4mwjBzxqgfQ,2,2,4,LISzsNeMwHHhDM1acoc32A

""NUMBER 8"" screamed the portly Hispanic cook from behind the counter over an Eminem song playing from the Internet radio juke box, signaling me to pick my order up. I ordered some fat fries and a large burger with the works. The burger was cooked just right, retaining the juices and the vegetables tasted fresh which is a plus in my book. The fat fries were piping hot from the oil bath. 

Not entirely sure if the other Fat Burgers are like this, but the Vegas ambiance and tasty burger made me a happy customer. Simply put this place shouldn't be compared to McDonald's or Wendy's. That being said  they can serve the burger to me through a hole for all I care as long as it's good and  I don't get food poisoning.

When I went there you could choose from small through XXXL for the burger size. I heard from a friend that their used to be only 3 sizes. I think that kind of simplicity would have be nice since I was quite baffled about which size to order. The burgers are all cooked to order which is nice but may cause a little bit of a wait. Cheese, chili, bacon, and egg are all chargable upgrades for the burger while other condiments are available for no additional charge. 

I was talked into the medium size burger. I added cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was too big. I got to the awkward point in my meal where I was satisfied to be done eating but only had a little bit of burger to go. I decided to avoid feeling the gut bomb and just tossed it. Along with my burger I ordered the skinny fries which turned out were not really all that skinny. I mean, they were pretty much standard size fries. I think I would have been better off if I topped them with chili or ordered the fat fries or onion rings instead. Lesson learned.

All in all, it is a decent option for late night eats. Especially if you want to avoid the more notorious fast food burgers, and of course, you have at least $10 to burn on a quick bite.",ygO1cO77BvQtU2FutLBFtQ,1,0,3,b8pAVqs6MTtgbmPNdiCM-g

During the wait for our food, I felt a strong need to wash my hands after using the soda fountain, getting my condiments, ect. Also, the employees seemed almost unhappy to be there, further making me doubt that they cared about preparing my food in a sanitary matter.

I gave 3 stars because good burgers DO live here! I've had them! I just don't know if I'm quite ready to go back. I'm ready to be introduced to the next best ""burger fix.""",U57-TL9sHbJRCdqexie79Q,1,1,3,IzrcPpgNa1nbiXDh-1YPOg

They were a bit dry and not too flavorful but the toppings I picked helped make up for it. I topped my medium sized burger with cheese, bacon, an egg, and the obligate onions/lettuce/mayo combo. I absolutely LOVE getting a fried egg on my burger because it adds a nice rich creaminess to the experience. I was underwhelmed with the toppings offered but the standards they do offer (and the fried egg, of course) will be enough for most people. 

I tried their skinny fries but felt they were bland and boring, and I wasn't into their super thick onion rings either. If I were to go to Fatburger again I'd probably try their dogs or chicken sandwiches just to see how they stack up but I think if you're in a pinch and hungry late at night while passing by, it would be worth it to grab something here.

I paid $20 for a drink to get into the Haze Night Club (it's free to get in so long as you buy a $20 drink coupon).  That got me a watered down vodka and Coke.  Yuck.  Then I paid $10 for a Sierra NV 12 oz beer.  After $30, I wasn't even close to feeling buzzed.  For $25 (using a $5 coupon) I got 55 oz of slushi strawberry margarita-flavored booze.  I expected it to be watered down a lot, but to my surprise, BANG!  It was LOADED with tequila!  I got drunk immediately.  So be careful.  I later blacked out.  I got the small guitar.  I know, it's totally touristy, but when in Vegas, be a lame tourist and live it up.  Trust me, the guitar gets you attention.  I had women taking photos of me with them and then they'd wear the guitar and get more photos.  Can you say chick magnet?  Too bad I was toasted by then and barely remember the whole ordeal.  None-the-less, the bikini beach bartenders were super friendly, and I'm telling you, there's nothing like drinking 55 oz of booze from a plastic guitar on a public street.  Unfortunately, it was the worst tasting margarita or dacquiri or whatever the hell they want to call it.  It was like pure corn syrup after the ice all melted.  It was hard to drink, but basically it was just a vehicle to help get the tequila down so don't expect craft, natural ingredient juice here.  Just swallow it down and get drunk.  I'm a craft cocktail snob, but this place isn't about craft cocktail numb nuts.  It's about the bikini bartenders, the guitar, and getting wasted on a public street in Vegas, and then blacking out.",Jed-PEquPj78qyejkevQyQ,1,0,4,ysq6mwpOCpTg2IV_DC2eag

I could not finish this damn thing.  It's actually bigger than it looks in the pic, you can't see the depth there.  And you have to chip away at an angle since it won't fit in your mouth.  The cook came out to check on my progress after 20 minutes and just laughed that I wasn't close to done.

It's a very good thing, but damn, that's a lot of meat.

Fatburger is great because they're open 24/7 and they're right there just north of the MGM on the Strip.  So at 1 am when you and all your drunk buddies are realizing how many empty calories are in half a bottle of vodka, and that all the good restaurants in Vegas close at 10 or 11, you know where to go.  Sure it gets messy in there but you're too drunk or hungry to care right?  

And you don't really want McDonald's do ya?  No.  No, you don't.

4234056,2016-11-22,1,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"Thought my tip would suffice but seeing some bad reviews of the place I just need to put mine in. 

The first time I ever tried Fat Burger was maybe three years ago. I never had any reason not to go to In N Out for a good and fast diner burger. But one drunken night we were in some casino (Red Rock?) where there was conveniently located, a Fat Burger. I can't deny a good old fashioned burger drunk or sober so it was on. 

I'm not dumb or close minded so I wasn't gonna compare them to In N Out or any other burger. Not every burger wants to be an In N Out burger, some burgers just wanna be themselves damnit. I really like this fat guy! He's more than doable for me and I was an instant fan.  

Plain hamburger all day every day. I'm old school. I'd eat it between sandwich bread. The patty is hand formed and made to order and while the flavor is not out of this world it is close to out of the ballpark for me. Not bad at all. I've returned many times to this location. 

Speaking of which, you'd think it's my favorite Fat Burger since there's a full bar outside. Nope. It's actually my least favorite and specifically because of the bar. The service out there sucks big baseballs. Doesn't matter if it's winter or summer, they be freezing. I've never seen so many man bitches. Soo rude and grumpy and not taking any pride in the place like the other workers inside and at their other locations. That's what confuses me. The workers inside at the counter where you order your food are excellent just like the guys at the casino. The manager here was professional and even the cooks were upbeat. I felt extremely welcomed inside and then entirely snubbed outside. 

But unless I'm feeling sensitive, it's the food that I really care about. I'd eat a decent burger from a Yankee fan I would. This here will be my drunk burger. 

I've had the garden burger which I liked fine, but I love frozen garden burgers, so. I tried the turkey burger and it was also fine so I stick to beef since we're all so fine. I prefer In N Outs protein burger because I like the full lettuce wrap as opposed to a salad set up they have here. I'll add bacon and cheese to my burgers if it's one of those nights but if I'm really trying to party I'll add an onion ring to a plain or cheeseburger. Hell yes. The onion rings are what keep me comin. Home run baby. My fave onion ring I've found in burger land.",EuWNFj1s2Z88DbZxptZF7A,2,2,4,UREmUPFC_N6ELr8AyaaS-Q

First Impressions:

I have to say the Late night service kind blows. Took 15 mins to get my order. Food came out in about 5 though. I guess this is how I remembered it.  The cashier took a long time doodling with the register, guest who had already been helped were coming back and trying to add things on or make changes.  It was a cluster F.

It took me 20 mins to get 2-small burger meals with drinks.  That irritated me but I was hungry.

On Second Look:

In my humble opinion, a good burger isn't defined by its gimmick or cult following - but rather it's patty.  This burger's patty was delicious and it complimented the rest of the crap on there.  The mayo and juices were flowing and got me to forget about the sub-par service I got while waiting for it.  I think it's whack that you have to pay extra for cheese, but hey this is America.  

The burger is better than the service.  Go there if you're hungry and want to grub out, but don't plan a trip around it.  They also have an outside bar now which is kind of lame.",6GEjXBYuNxwxP_IV6w8ECA,0,0,3,b0EZ22JQ4-UKTUBwBEVtXw

First experience - took a cab here from the club before getting dropped off....this experience was between 2-2 1/2 stars. service was ok, fat fries were good, but my medium fat burger w/ chz was really salty on one side. 
Next night I decided to give them another chance.....hiked all the way over here from Wynn at 4am.....I wanted to sober up, so that long walk did the trick. 
This time it was a little different....they had music playing, all the employees were having a great time and the service reflected that....
customers were coming in and dancing or singing along to the music (rap from early 2000 mostly)...and even choppin it up w/ each other while waiting for the food. 
I got a mini fatburger w/ cheese, fat fries, and skinny fries (for my gf). Said bye to my new friends.....grabbed a cab (I was almost sober, so no point in walking back) and headed back.

Our sad tale begins by being greeted by our waitress, a woman that would make a skank look classy.  She took our order for a couple of beers and for our food.  She returned 10 minutes later with our beers, but that was the last that we saw her.  I guess that on some level, I should have been thankful. Any prolonged contact with our server would have ensured an incurable case of syphillis at the very least.   Did I mention that she was dirty??

After 45 minutes of waiting for the food, our beers long dry, we sought out our server to find out what was going on.  Upon finding her, the skank threw us a lot shade, and even had the nerve to state that it was my fault that we had been waiting so long.  Yup...skanks truly are dumb. 

At that point, I decided to minimize my contact with my server without having the benefit of a hazmat suit and found the manger.  Of course, he offered to get us our food right away, but we were pushing up on an hour at this point.  While this was all going on, my herpes scarred waitress was screaming that she had done nothing wrong....except be a waste of human life that is.  The manager saw what was going on and offered to comp us our entire check.  That being said, we thanked him, but told him tht he could keep his crap food because my guest and I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

I'm by no means a burger expert, but I can tell if a burger is good in the sense of juiciness. This place wasn't bad, however I prefer In-N-Out over Fatburger if I were to live in the western US. If only the In-N-Out in Las Vegas was actually on The Strip proper...but I did plan to explore more next time I'm in Vegas.

I had two medium Fatburgers with onion rings for one of them. Believe it or not, the onion rings here are much better than the burgers. I love o-rings that are huge in size, and the fact the onions were also large in size (it's not just batter). This place has both aimed spot on! As for the burgers...I like the fact there are different sizes for the burgers, cause there's no way I'm eating a XL. I also like the fact the burgers are lean beef, so it's less unhealthy for you, although that might have contributed to why I find the burgers not as juicy as In-N-Out.

Again if I had to choose between Fatburger and In-N-Out, it's In-N-Out all the way. However Fatburger is also a great choice for those Vegas folks who don't wanna leave The Strip and want something that's not a buffet or splurge restaurant for a change.",1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,0,0,3,vb8Vp7H5nzQCUJYMx_O-nw

The choice was McDonald's or Fat Burger,  My wife and I decided to try this place more so because McDonald's was crowded and we also wanted to sit down and enjoy a drink or two :)

We walked in bar area and were told by one of the guys cleaning the tables that we could sit at any of the table and order our food and drink there.  Well we waited and waited and we waited a bit more... The lady servers kept ignoring us and a few other people sitting at the other tables... We waited around  30 minutes or more

In the end our patience ran out and we walked out... As we left two young ladies were handing out coupons to people passing by to get them to go in.... Really why... You could not take care of customers who were actually there...  

The good news is we did not waste our money on this dive and found a place that served just what we wanted.. sadly no drinks... but awesome customer service... Check out my review on that place and give this dump a miss.",fn9IwPVoMfbJgZo07WU_jA,2,3,1,aZdZVO93ag0mO9uq9HWhFQ

Bar-2:30pm only 6 people spread out around a circular bar. Cut a pie in fourths and I took the last remaining section. The bartender waited/stood in one section and didn't move out of that area for 15min (not exaggerating) except to make drinks in service bar or talk to couple near service bar or check her phone (3x), never once looking at or acknowledging other customers. Granted it gave me PLENTY of time to study the menu and decide what I wanted, AND search my phone for other options. But, I wanted a burger.

Table- So, I switched to a table top, since they looked like they were getting waited on.  Again, not many people and service was slow but at least some one showed up to take an order. Service was-take order, run, drop, run, ask if u need anything as she's almost to next table, drop check. Sigh

Food- I sat across from a sign saying ""voted best burger in Las Vegas.""
WOW, WoW, wow, the standard for burgers must be REALLY low for Las Vegas. My niece and I have made it our mission to search the DFW area for  the best burger, so I have some idea.
The pattie reminded me of a bulk stack of patties I once and last time bought from Walmart.
The rest of the burger, reminded me of Burger King.

It's a typical Fatburger which means juicy burgers, and the fat fries (nice steak cut fries) are a must. This location is a bit pricey; now this just could be that I haven't been to a Fatburger since I moved away from LA, or their prices are just higher since it's on the strip. I'd go with the latter.

The wait is kinda ridiculous here. There was no one in front of me, and all I ordered was a cheeseburger and fries, and I waited like 30 minutes for my to-go order. Also, my burger came to me way before my fries, even though I was taking it to go, so I was pretty concerned my food was going to get cold. It's weird because loads of others got their fries before me, and I had to ask about my fries after my burger came, so I think they just kinda forgot part of my order.

Ultimately, this was an ok meal. I was in town because my boyfriend was at a convention, so I just wanted to grab something quick and take it back to the room since I was solo at the time. I just really wanted some fat fries though.

In Vegas, there's so many places that are better than this, and probably quicker (and maybe cheaper) that I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere.

Okay, they are open 24 hours...that is cool.  Okay, you do have a nice bar set up outside...this is cool also, even for a person that does not drink such as myself.  Yet, your prices are crack head crazy!

I must admit, the burger is not already made, already pressed meat filler substance that most chain restaurants serves you.  You had real beef on your metal tray, and you can taste the difference.  The strawberry banana shake, and the chocolate banana shake was both awesome.  Fresh ingredients in those most definitely, which you verified by not having all the banana completely shaken in your shake.  Yet, you charge for everything.  You want both buns, another 50 cents. Cheese is $1, straw for your shake is $1, use the restroom is $1, and looking in the direction of the bathroom is 50 cents.  

They made sure to have some of the decorum in a retro style diner set up, which was nice for nostalgia sake.

Best thing I ate here were the fries, Picked the skinny ones, as opposed to the steak fries. Very crispy outer shell and only slightly salty. A very clean natural flavor. 

The burger patty was tasteless as seems to be the M.O. for fast food joints these days with their overcooked meat. Nothing at all special about the burger.

The thing that was also weird was that it was a multi person bathroom.

We walked in, we had never been here before, and it was a straight shot to the cash register. The way this place is set up is awkward and if there would have only been 3-4 people ahead it would have put almost back to the door. I could see how during busy times it would suck cause you would be stuck outside while standing in line.

We got up to the register and looked for a menu, there was none. All they had was a little laminated sheet that told you what the burger toppings were. They have a digital menu, but it is not helpful. In my opinion the screen moves waaaaaay too fast, you see something that looks good but then the screen changes. It a pain cause while you are trying to figure out what you want, you also dont want to hold up the line either.

We finally decided on our order and purchased 3 cheeseburgers, and order of fries, 1 soda and 1 strawberry shake and it cost around $45!!!

The burgers were VERY good though. The buns were butter grilled, the burger was very juicy and had a good flavor. I especially loved the crispy char on the ring of the burger. The fries were cooked to perfection. They give you the option of steak cut fries or thin...we opted for the thin ones. My strawberry shake was creamy and had chunks of strawberry in it. I am not sure what I was expecting in regards to the shakes.

2. Lots of menu options. Whether you like turkey burgers, veggie burgers, a paleo burger, or shake, this is your stop. 

3. Friendly staff. The service is great. 

4. The food is really good. Especially the onion rings and the shake. 

Cons:

1. restroom is kind of nasty. 

2. Because the food is so good...the line is long. 

3. Even though I enjoyed my food, I felt it was a bit overpriced. I paid $18.00 for my burger, onion rings, and shake.",veinj01t7xVhbOaNQ66DyQ,0,0,4,iv6eKbehNWqxtiUxy4bcqQ

4759717,2013-08-31,1,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"My kids love Fatburgers!  After sitting in crappy traffic on the Strip, enjoying a sightsee of all the pretty lights, I was able to do a U-turn and hit this place.  The parking was a breeze even if you do have to shoo people out of the way from crossing the driveway, which is nonstop.  Sorry, move the F out of the way, I'm coming in because I'm hungry enough to jump out and start chewing on one of you people.

We got in and there was no crowd.  I have to warn you here, FB is pricey, but we knew that already.  I just ordered for the one daughter, but my other one decided she wanted McDonald's; me too.  Woo-hoo, McDeath's is just next door!!!!  Sweet!

So got one kid situated outside at the open air seating, complete with open bar and misters.  Please, if you're a slow eater, sit away from the misters because they spray every other second and it does get annoying after a bit.  We went to the McD's next door and luckily avoided a big gang of folks who herded in.  

It was very nice sitting there people-watching out on the strip.  A nice calm evening with my teenagers, watching guys hand out X-rated flyers to passers-by.  

Leaving is the same hassle as coming in because I had to darn near run over folks to leave because they don't care if you've been sitting there a while waiting to LEAVE!  Fortunately, I'm from back East and have a A-card on guerrilla driving.  MOVE!  So just be prepared to be a little proactive in that department.",0UkDD2bAIc4Zq-JGVvq-9w,0,0,4,J1vDh263PL-NBi6vb16Ggg

succulent burgers, golden brown fries, cavity-forming root beer float..., need i say more?  i could hardly contain myself when i was in line and almost plowed into the people in front of me.  ya so i was hungry, forgive me (i'm being religious here).  i broke down and ordered me a chili-cheese fries, a cheese burger, and washed it down with a big-ass root beer float (sinful).  i can't say that  i'll stay afloat after having all that food (i'm going down straight to hell)..., but i sure felt an orgasmic (heavenly) experience.

Great juicy burgers with tiny fries. It is fast food, but definitely a great deal especially late at night in Vegas after having some drinks during the evening. 

Service:
Service here is what I had a problem with. When I ordered for my boyfriend and myself, I had to repeat the order several times to the man at the register. He seemed to have trouble understanding our orders. For example, when stating that I wanted everything except tomatoes on my hamburger, he placed the order with tomatoes only. After continuously trying to have our order input correctly, I still had to walk up to the people preparing the food to have the order changed to what we wanted.

Atmosphere:
Interesting crowd. I remember there being a drunk girl falling all over the place in line. The bathroom here was not worth using, so I waited until heading back to our hotel.

Value:
Inexpensive quick meal, especially after you have already had a huge dinner elsewhere earlier in the evening followed by drinks.",ThK4SjvQs-a3cOqUAgSJlQ,0,0,3,MTm22ZRNFcL6wMX4-GKuyQ

The place was right across the street from my hotel - so convenient!  I passed by this place a few times, with no intentions of going inside.  At around 3AM on a Wednesday, after a great time on the strip, was heading back to the hotel, and I was hungry.  It was practically empty inside.

I'm so happy I went here!!  I had the Small (Baby Fat) Fatburger with cheese, bacon and an egg. DELICIOUS!!  I'm drooling right now...  The skinny fries were great too.

I even made a trip to In-N-Out sometime the next day - my first time there actually.  Although it was good, I preferred Fatburger, and made more trips here instead!

The location was convenient, and the people that worked there were really nice, funny actually.  People have said that they have encountered shady customers.  However, I went there a few times between 1-4AM, and all I saw were tourists, like myself. Maybe I was just lucky.

A few other spots have the BOCA patty but all the other elements that make their burgers come no where close to taste and portions like Fat Burger does. They also offer a GARDEN patty but something about the hearty taste of the BOCA wins. They use a 5oz patty instead of the 3oz like the other places use, it's meatier and filling. A giant plus. 

Their combination of mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish & onion are simple and delicious. I order mine with extra pickles and both raw and grilled onions with no mayo, so satisfying. Order with fat fries and you won't regret it.

5575710,2008-09-22,3,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"I have only one word to say about this place: GHETTO!

We went here on a late Saturday night, approx. 3am after a crazy, clubbing night at Jet. Right when we walked in, some customers were having some kind of staring contest or mad dawging contest, and a fight was about to break out! One guy was saying ""Hey dude! Stop looking at me!"" and the other guy just ran up to him, mad dawged him up close and personal, and then said they would take it outside. Once they walked outside, tons of people rushed out...and even the Fatburger WORKERS! Oh my goodness!?!? What happened to customer service? What happened to the security? Well, even the security guard didn't care...he wanted to see it too! 

At any rate, I don't think anything happened. The workers all came back in, and our late night dinner ensued..

My bf and I split a cheeseburger meal. The fries were nice and hot, and tasted ok. The burger was pretty good, as others have told me. Yes, I agree with others that it is better than In-and-Out's old-fashioned take on burgers. 

The place was dirty too! People just leave their trash everywhere, and workers don't clean the areas regularly. You would think that if this restaurant is in some sort of tourist area like the Strip, they would have better service and a more tourist-catered atmosphere. They don't....and it sucks...

If you are craving for that Fatburger, I recommend going somewhere else (and not this stinky, ghetto place)!

I was gonna give this place 1 star, but the burger convinced me to be a bit more generous, so I gave it another..",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,3,3,2,Nu5eAXVPDNgAQuz_wcxMFw

I could go for some fries and a milkshake...that sounded remotely like breakfast, I thought. Anyway, inside, we were greeted by the same group of people. Drunk club goers, dude-bros and many other interesting characters. The girls in front of us were leaning all over the registers screaming ""I want salt on my burger!""...by the time we were served, the guy was either deaf or just a little slow. It took us 5 minutes to order fries and a shake. He kept asking, ""you want vanilla shake??VANILLA??""

We set up camp in the corner by the window, and people watched till our food came. One fellow was using his soda cup as a barf receptacle. The girls who wanted salt on their burgers were now shouting about who's boyfriend was who's.

So you know how you go to a fast food joint and the burgers on the menu behind the counter are shown all nice and big and juicy, but when you order it, it turns out to be an overcooked, undersized, nothing remotely close to a sandwich even worthy of being called a reasonable facsimile thereof? Well, Fattburger has mastered this process...inversely. The picture on the menu did not even begin to do justice to the mammoth, gigantic, huge, swollen, bloated mass of beef served greasily to me between the two unfortunate slices of bun forced to bear the weight of this thing. To make matters worse (or better, depending on one's POV), I had an additional patty, avocado and bacon added to the behemoth. 

The ride back to the hotel was arduous. The aroma of the fried beast filled the car, beckoning to my hunger to stagger at the next red light and take a large bite from this beefy buffet. Wisdom prevailed, however, as I knew that once the beast was unleashed, it would go neither quietly nor cleanly back into its now saturated paper encasing. Must hurry. 
Barely, but successfully, I transported the package to my room, bag intact, where it was stripped down to its full, naked, delicious elegance. At last, we are alone, you and I. Come. 

With all my hunger, I was still not able to finish. ""Fatt"" does NOT accurately describe the girth of this burger. Try as I might, a happy plate (bag rather) was not to be. Stomach capacity exceeded. Digestion activated. Food coma eminent. Not to worry. With a refrigerator and microwave readily available, we shall meet again very soon. Abdominal pain setting in. Oh Lord, please let me make it thru the night. 

If you find yourself in Vegas, be sure to treat yourself to a Fattburger. I warn you, though. Do not underestimate this sandwich, for it is Fatter than its Fatt namesake. Also, I don't recommend more than one within a six month period. Your heart and grandkids will thank you.

The guy at the counter was super fast and focused. Not something you see much these days. I'd say fair prices considering where you are. 

Beware of the bathrooms.

5946455,2016-07-14,2,LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw,"My experience at Fat burger was truly a experience. I visited this location and the cashier was so nice, however I couldn't understand why she was the only person working the register when 10 - 12 other employee's were standing around and just talking and having a great time. I found that to be really rude because my group had a lot of people and the ordering process might have went faster if another employee cam to the register. 

I ordered the turkey burger and steak fries. I was really please with the way the burger turned out. The turkey was not dried out or flavorless. However the young lady that dropped the burger off to the table had a massive amount of weave in her head. I am not knocking her for that but if your going to serve food I personally think you should have all of that hair in a bun to avoid it from touching my food. Overall the food was really good and the cashier was great but the other areas discussed needs lots of improvement.",WkGazfr_s80m6X0-ngrLmA,1,0,2,bn0w9acFBV-zdpFBrSQTYQ

Honestly, it took about 30 mins to get 2 milkshakes.

A lot of the customers in the restaurant seemed unhappy with their service.

I get that it was 1am at night, but it took over 3 mins for me to pay with a credit card.


I love the Fatburger franchise, but this location does it shame.",FL0cDJZAPcggxhVzopIDhg,0,0,1,C8lG2s9GMEQxhbQzN1dE8w

Stopped in because I heard this place was decent. Ordered a 1/3# breakfast burger (burger, egg, bacon, cheddar) and they had an advertisement for free fries with a purchase of a draft beer, so naturally, I jumped on this offer. We ended up getting charged for the fries, went back up, the cashier had recognized us and his mistake, apologized and admitted he got a bit flustered with the line that was forming behind us. The fact that he straight up admitted he made a mistake, without trying to dance around the issue, really made me appreciate the service here. So he called over the manager and they were going to refund us, which I know can be a pain, so I asked if we could get onion rings instead, and the manager (without hesitation) said yes. FANTASTIC SERVICE. The onion rings were brought right over.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast burgers. I can say this wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was better than some of the worst. The meat could've used more flavor, but regardless, a good burger!

It was a tad bit expensive though. For 2 breakfast burgers, 1 beer, and fries was $40...",JlAJ1I-ebp_MGWtIHP2PgA,0,0,4,ZssBSR-eAy0B9o-C1w5LGA
