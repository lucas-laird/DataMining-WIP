You know exactly what you are getting when you pull into a drive thru.  

Every time I have been here, I'm happy.  I'm not a huge fast food eater but sometimes a bacon burger and some tater tots can really hit the spot. 

Sonic has the best ice.  Did you know you can buy it in a bag??  So good!  I love love love the Strawberry Slush.  The amazing ice is crushed up even more and there are bits of fresh strawberry in this sugary drink that is sooo good.  Yummy.",v9OduhydB8PtSuniEGbl_Q,0,0,5,KkxAFqyEvInaOMkS8chDqw

At times we find bits of other flavors on our blast indicating that they obviously aren't completely cleaning their equipment from the last customer order.  C'mon Sonic, keep your game tight.

I'm a AGM for a 400 seat restaurant with much more standers then what sonic would be. But you can at least train your staff to work smarter and more efficient then what this staff is.. every time I've come I sit forever if they have one or two cars it takes FOREVER!! Idk if the manager doesn't have proper staffing or they don't care if these kids move or not... Waiting 15-20 mins in the heat you tend to loss your appetite.. Bottom line this is horribly managed!!  Not too mention your profits would be much higher!  I watched 4 cars pull away by the time I decided to join them!  All while he original car sat at the ordering station!!! Super annoying!!!

No pretzel buns for their special pretzel hot dogs. I was going to try one. Scratch that. Also I was charged twice for my order. I even had it up on my phone to show the girl and she said it only went thru once. Hmmm okay.

I have had better experiences at DMV or the post office. Yes they do have the half priced shakes which is good but you might as well pay full price. I got a large popcorn chicken for $5.29 and it's the size of a medium fry I also got a 4 piece mozzarella stick. Now if your selling mozzarella sticks you should know the customer would like marinara with them so it should come to mind with simple common sense to notify the customer that you are out of marinara sauce when you are ordering not give the customer their food for them to look and see there isn't any marinara so now have to go back into the drive through line just to ask for marinara for them to say they don't have any. I will never go to this location again I'd rather drive to the location by the cannery. So the reasons this location is getting a 1 star is because of the pricing and quantity of the popcorn chicken and the lack of knowledge, work ethic, and common sense of their staff.",sKDocgxeWITytbzbh-t_XA,1,0,1,vAC_4z6_Jsf5IVF7OvxE0A

2659282,2015-09-08,5,roA-hNugvAwiyVirIFH8Aw,"I have dined at this establishment 4 times in the hopes of one time getting the experience that I have always read about, a solid combination of old fashioned service, delicious tater tots and unique beverages, and the fun niche of being served by a young lad on roller skates. Unfortunately, the reality of Sonic is a far cry from what is represented by the company in both written and visual advertising. 

Let's start with the service. The ""quick serve"" drive thru lane consistently has a faulty speaker system that makes it extremely difficult to place an order without having to repeat it several times. When I asked a question concerning its expansive menu, I would often receive a dead silent reply and no answers forthcoming. Add this to to the consistently long wait time for the food, and it leads to extremely high expectations to justify the wait. Unfortunately, this justification is also in vain. 

The food quality has been extremely disappointing on all visits. Though I can say that the pretzel dogs are a shining light, the tater tots are consistently mushed together and served well below what I would consider to be an adequate temperature. 

The value just isn't there either. I have no problem paying a premium for higher and fast food (like In N Out, for example) but Sonic just doesn't deliver on this aspect either. 

Overall, I am extremely disappointed  with both the food quality and service at this local Sonic and I simply cannot recommend it to anyone.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,7,5,2,tGihCnpbG5bP-tXcM9e3aA

Another thing: Sonic's food is not good. I notice the mediocre rating and attribute that to the ridiculously slow service and trash food. So why am I so familiar with this location? The drinks! And that's why Sonic gets an a-ok from me. If you go during happy hour, they are mega cheap. They have an even better special before 10AM in which I think a large is only a buck? My favs are the cherry limeade and the ocean water. They also have lemonades, slushes, floats, and ice cream treats. You can get soda with flavored syrup as well, which is what my Mom typically goes for. I don't drink so Sonic is the place to be for me; after a rough day, I often crave a big old soda and Sonic has always got my back. I've been spending lots of time at this location (literally, because the drive thru is slow) because my pup has been getting laser treatments at the vet just up so the street, so we swing by on our way home. 
I did attempt some food about a month ago, and they got my order wrong. I made the mistake of not checking until I got home. I called the manager (his personal cell is on the receipt which I find a little odd) and he said he'd rectify it by refunding a portion of my meal, which never happened.

The service was terrible and the food was so greasy. The grease was oozing from the tater tots and the cheese wasn't even melted on my dog which makes me wonder what kind of cheese it is to begin with. I asked for regular coke and got diet.

5140835,2014-11-24,0,roA-hNugvAwiyVirIFH8Aw,I really like that this Sonic is open till 2am unfortunately the sonic near my house was closed its only 11 o'clock and it's a Sunday evening this is Las Vegas who the fork closes before midnight. I would really appreciate it if I didn't have to drive 3&a half miles to go get my dessert fix after spending some private time with my girlfriend but you know for Sonic I'll Drive as far as I have to especially since the truth is I'm sitting in the passenger seat and my girlfriend doing the driving so I can go get the ice cream better yet cuz I spent all my money on the smartphone that I'm giving the review with my girlfriend is paying for the ice cream and she was on top doing the work today so this is pretty cool,EB7cPGf6dSCTNcZ7qOfGQg,1,0,4,R4suRBeAbknVJoS_B0xmVg
5193106,2018-03-01,0,roA-hNugvAwiyVirIFH8Aw,"The ease of ordering outside is great but the customer service, lack of speed, and attention to detail is poor. When ordering, the male rushed our order. After every single item we ordered the male would ask, ""would that be all?"" It just made the process longer. Waiting for our FIRST set of food didn't take that long but we ended up having to wait even longer than the first time for missed fries and burger. We asked for no topping on our milkshake yet it still came with toppings. Though all this the lady whom brought our food out never once apologized for the wait or errors. We never asked to be compensated for their mistake but that would have been a great time to say, ""I apologize we made your shake wrong, let me remake it while you wait for your missed burger and fries."" or at least just remake the shake in general. Neither of those happened. Not the best place to go when you're in somewhat of a time crunch.",QCGi-M-5vceWRUWwZcGrKA,1,0,2,LCnLMRvIIRpmIWmTJhLSzw

5464590,2017-09-29,0,roA-hNugvAwiyVirIFH8Aw,They should have actual adults working here !! I waited 20 minutes for my food . Not only did I wait 20 minutes they didn't even put that much food in the container . I ordered a large chili cheese fry and I opened it to 6 fries . The milk shake they gave me was over filled and the lid wasn't even on all the way and spilled all over my new car and not once did they apologize . Nothing but hoodrats working here . They were all just standing around .,NDAgCI9GLmF0mIFEqW_uNA,0,0,1,ECvO0Dsmh1VUlkMBa9ScgQ
5516652,2016-03-14,0,roA-hNugvAwiyVirIFH8Aw,"I was disappointed! I love the commercials showing wth pretzel sandwiches, hotdogs, shakes and umpteen types of drinks. Since we didn't have Sonic back home (Ohio) we were all excited about our first taste. 

Ok, maybe Walmart isn't the best place to experience a restaurant, but that's where we saw it. Between the two of us we tried the hot dog, fries, cheeseburger, and peanut butter milkshake. 

Nothing special- even the peanut butter shake was underwhelming. Nothing was bad- it was just normal fast food fare when we expected a cut above. Oh, well. We still like the commercials!",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,2,2,2,iM_UxkcrvFl7SymXpEnbXg

Hopefully the rest of the restaurant isn't like the  front, this place looks run down and unkept. The concrete is completely filthy and the tables have food debris stuck to them.. Gross 

Hospitality: 4 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Friendly and repeating of my order to insure accuracy. 

Food: 4 Stars
Our order was complete, and accurate. Each item was hot and fresh. However, some times were kept warm instead of made to order. 

Overall:
This place is great for a drive thru only, as I wouldn't recommend dining on the patio.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,0,0,3,b76_0hMiHQfjGmZ5dUp5RQ

The workers don't care, every one of my last 5 orders, as of tonight, have been wrong. The management must be seriously lacking now, no more chances. Never going back to this place",_Rz7_dVaSmc9k-huNCfhBQ,1,0,1,QezvNWKQ7lKKUpAgvEMcxQ
