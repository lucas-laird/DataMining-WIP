12179,2012-01-07,0,tsYriuDpdtaTju7LUANDzg,I live across the street and don't have a car so don't have many choices in where to eat out if and when we do. I will choose anything over Panda again! The last two times my husband went there for me when I was having a craving the food had been sitting for a while cause it was cold and mushy... Not to mention I got food poisoning just 2 weeks ago from there!!!! GO ANY PLACE ELSE!!!!!!!!!,GHWXpt1cjtqd1D8hK-TOpw,0,0,1,68t9ekQN-27qdw_YNyViaA

The employees are usually extremely nice although today I did have an employee who ruined my experience here. I've never seen this customer before her name was breeysi. When I first pulled up to the speaker I asked for a minute, literally 5 seconds later with no guests behind me she asks again, I politely said not yet and she smacked her mouth probably not knowing whether I could hear and seemed upset as if I was taking much of her time. When I get to the window she makes no eye contact nor says a word just my total. Even when taking my card there was no word exchange. Finally when I leave she says ""have a nice day"" but still no eye contact and shuts the window right away. Just rude customer service. Happily the order was correct but hopefully next time I'll look forward to the other cheerful employe",ClTYJcrwUY8VKDs1rGv_pw,0,0,2,Y_AMopuYC72Tx0D4kaalYw

1753078,2017-07-22,0,tsYriuDpdtaTju7LUANDzg,"Sometimes when I order ""chicken with mushroom"", I mean CHICKEN WITH mushroom. When a guest wants black pepper chicken, they want black pepper CHICKEN. Not black pepper onions and celery. I had about 20 mushrooms in my tiny container, and maybe 8 pieces of chicken. The veggies on the black pepper covered almost the entire bottom of the other side of the to-go container. Not sure if you only do this to drive thru people, but rude. (And yes, the chow mein has WAY too much cabbage in it.) Prices are constantly and consistently going up all over, so stop shorting your customers what they're paying more money for, please.",EoSZrxRGLhppt1TR64iu0Q,0,0,2,cfW8swXmps5xP0INFi_tUg

There was hardly any line and we got our food quickly. The seating was about 1/3 full. We were satisfied with our food. Good ol' Orange Chicken. One of my favorite foods.

2900247,2017-10-22,0,tsYriuDpdtaTju7LUANDzg,"I come here all the time because it's close to my office. I use the drive thru, and they almost always get my order wrong. I only order 2 plates. Today Saturday, October 21st, the same thing happened. I really don't want to say the name of the female employee that treated me rudely. I checked my food because the same girl has given me wrong food before. The teriyaki chicken was very undercooked, never like before, I asked if she can grill it some more or just give me chicken with at least some grill marks. She sighed and threw the food in the trash. I even asked her if she's ok, and I asked for the manager and she said she wasn't there. Then 10 seconds later another employee asked if everything was ok. I briefly told her what had happened and just decided to ask for corporate's phone number. 

I hate to complain, especially because I come here for lunch quite often and the employees are cool. Except for this one particular employee that begins with the letter C. I strongly believe that customer service and compassion is very important when dealing with the public. Doesn't matter what you do or where you work. Always treat people with respect, especially paying customers. 

I give this place 2 stars because of all the times I had to drive back from work to return my wrong order. Such a waste of food.  Now, I always check my order before I drive off. 

Thank you very much for your time.",ldfQl6sgjgKzLYBo_m962A,0,0,2,o0SkC0w-RVIw6GWeDSGbKg

This particular location has the best tasting food panda restaurant out of maybe 5 that I know of. My work place orders panda once in a while in Henderson and they are nowhere close to the taste that this location makes. 

The only problem that I get (sometimes) is that when we order at the drive thru they keep on forgetting to add bbq sauce on my teriyaki bbq chicken. So I have to constantly remind them to add the sauce lol. oh and they give so little meat when you order the angus beef.

The cooks here are the best!",0ionHqrxUWcYGjfRtZ36sA,1,0,4,J67pHAKOiN-MO6vaz3bBYQ

5709692,2016-11-08,0,tsYriuDpdtaTju7LUANDzg,"I've been to bad Panda Expresses and good ones. This one, based on my two visits here, is among my top 2 favorite ones. Servers are friendly, one server was wiping his counter after filling each order, and one server even went around offering extra sauce, etc. to the diners, even though it was a busy time. The server made sure to put in a good proportion of beef in my Broccoli Beef. The meat was sliced thin and was tender. Service was fast enough, given the crowd. I did not realize until later that this location also has a drive-thru!

Marlene at the drive-through was exceptionally kind and friendly, yet professional. She asked if I wanted egg rolls, which I wasn't going to order, but this time am glad she prompted me to order them. Everything was yummy. I had not been to a Panda Express lately because it seemed the chicken did not seem to be natural anymore; it had been tough and just did not taste fresh. This time, the chicken was tender and fresh.",1ydsjyNOYdgA93vWRtj7kw,0,0,5,CsYFAUZErsNzCWboR9sIDQ

Went here on Monday 10-5-15 through the drive thru.  I got a two-entree plate with half rice, half chow mein, kung pao chicken, and orange chicken, and a small mushroom chicken for my boy.  The total was $8.97. 

I usually get the same thing but sometimes I'll branch out and get the honey walnut chicken or some fried shrimp or cream cheese wontons.  

Never say no to Panda.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,6,4,5,Bm9Xg__qVSB7_nCAn-MwQw
