14572,2015-06-06,2,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"First off we run a restaurant here locally, so we know the trials of food service. I hate to say it but we are critical about our dinners out, nothing sucks more than a shitty meal period! On the level of service: because we eat in bar always this is only the bartenders. The female bartenders are totally by far better than the male. And sorry matt but the only reason for my tip was the food. Bartenders should socialize with patrons, here's a phrase to learn "" Hows your day/night going""? a little chit chat goes a long way. The ladies are always attentive, friendly, and smile.  

Now the food: the food is the reason we eat there a lot, twice this week actually. The chef must be newer because the food is far better than before. Unfortunately I'm terrible with names so without that I can't say who cooked our entries but who cares if they are that good! We found a little gem the wedge salad. G's wedge salad (lettuce wedge) spanks any wedge in Vegas. Del frisco's needs this wedge. Simply put amazing, try it you'll see. so two thumbs up from us keep up the tasty food, good portions, and so on. ciao bella",F_JNwAbWWCwQt2xjcc4kUQ,2,1,5,xnnqZGztlehLmbHQG3cc7g

On a side not, I also love that they separate the smoking section off so you are not dining in a restaurant full of smoke (like in most other sports bar/grills).  
The salads are all very good choices especially the antipasto salad.  And did I mention portion sizes... they are huge so I almost always end up taking some home for a quick dinner later on.  Enjoy!",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,0,0,4,OMkjs1kJ9QLUvvlHOwBPJg

We get delivery at least 20 times or more a year. Per them we are ""great customers"" when I called to complain that they won't deliver any longer. Yet they still won't deliver. 

Get your delivery from anythingyouwantdelivery.com. They actually honor their great customers and have sent delivery drivers on holidays to deliver for us!

We will NEVER go back to Giuseppe's simply for honor. You don't screw over a great client who raves about you. Because your GPS says it's 5.1 miles and mapquest says its 4.78.

340269,2012-07-31,2,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"I was out with my family searching for a nice Italian meal but didn't want to drive all the way to Maggiano's.  Now whenever I visit an off strip restaurant I have two criteria that they must meet to achieve 3 or more stars:
1. It is equal to or better than Sizzler 
2. The service is decent enough where I don't have to wait more than 5 minutes at a time for my server to return with a refill etc.

Fists off my 4 year old wanted sautéed mushrooms instead of a meat ball on his kids spaghetti, the server said she couldn't do it and it would be a $3 up charge. I could imagine that mushrooms were cheaper than meat until I tried the mealy, grainy, over worked, flavorless turd that they put on his plate. 

I had the hot wings which were clearly fried from frozen considering the menu says it takes at least 15 minutes for them to arrive and I know how long it takes to cook chicken.  They weren't bad and the sauce was decent with out too much vinegar. My 5 year old had the kids chicken parmesan which was surprisingly large but lacked flavor. The same with cavatelli meat sauce my girl friend had.  I am shocked by how little basic seasoning they use. I think the only salt in the entire restaurant is on the table. There was none in the pasta water none in the sauce and certainly none when the meat was cooking.  Honestly I could make better Italian food on a camp stove.  

I think the bottom line is I am so sick of being let down by Italian. I hate signing my fifty dollar check and thinking to myself how I could have gone to fazoli's if I wanted a shitty meal.

The host was very friendly, the waitress very sweet and informative and even the manager came around and asked me and my party if we were found well. 

The food itself was delicious. I started with their soup of the day which was the parmesan potato soup. Yummy creaminess! Then I ordered the chopped steak for my entrée. The may was good but the sauce with the onions and mushrooms was so savory. Pair that with some sliced fried potatoes and grilled zucchini.. unbelievable for only $10! How can you beat that quality for that price!

Dessert was by far the best part of the meal. My party and I ordered the tiramisu, brownie cheesecake and a slice of the lemon coconut cake so we could all kinda share. I could have ate all three because they were so good. On top of that, the portions were huge. I love any 4 layer cake that takes up almost the entire plate and is made so deliciously.

I've been searching for good pizza in this city and have been disappointed by every place besides Grimaldi's and Settebello. I came her a few weeks ago after I had been told that they were known as being great pizza. 

Food - I have to say the food was wildly boring. The server also didn't point out that I was ordering a HUGE salad when I ordered the ceasar before my pizza. I also had asked if it was served chilled, which she said yes. That wasn't my idea of chilled but I guess we all have different definitions. I ordered their appetizer pizza/flatbread. I'd go into detail about it but it was so boring I only remember thinking that the only reason I was eating it was because I was really hunger. There was nothing memorable about it and definitely not worth coming back for any time soon.

Service - This had to be the worst service I've had in Las Vegas. It seemed to take forever with little communication. Maybe she was looking for menus for a bit but you could tell me that instead of having me wonder what is going on. She also had little personality. I sat there for quite a LONG time waiting to flag her down and get my check, while I watched her bitch and gossip with the other bartender forever. She didn't even seem to pretend to look around and see if anyone needed anything. I tipped 15% which is LOW for me.

2557871,2010-08-18,0,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"We ventured over here to meet some family for lunch. The one thing that is odd from an outsiders view of Vegas is how many places just sprout up in the middle of nowhere. Vegas has been growing so fast that things just develop next to the roads, sometimes all by themselves. This is one of those places that's just surrounded by dirt and other stuff in the distance. That doesn't take away from the fact that I found this place to be pretty good. 

The deal/hook? Five dollar lunch specials. Yeah, you read right: $5! I ordered the linguine marinara sauce. It was actually really good. The sauce focused the tomato flavor very well. It was thick, but smooth on the pallet. The one negative is that is was kind of small. The fiancée had a salad. It was in a large bowl AND included a small bowl of soup. She was unable to finish it all, plus I ate some of it. Now, that was definitely worth five bucks!

The service was very attentive although we were there at a time when the restaurant was pretty empty. No reason to think it wouldn't translate over to busier times though. They were very friendly.

We got our salads shortly after, but then waited over twenty minutes after we were finished with them to receive our dinner orders.  My steak was over salted, and the shrimp scampi was definitely not scampi - it was grilled shrimp coated in season salt.  The mushroom risotto side was the saltiest thing on my plate.  My hubby got lasagna, which he usually loves, but only finished half.  My mother in law got cold chicken parmigiana.  Then we sat and waited - and waited - and finally our server came over to see if we wanted the check.  The leftovers were taken to the back to be boxed up and brought out ten minutes later.

The food was pretty good, but once we finished eating, we couldn't find our server for another 20 minutes and then had to take the bill to the bar and find someone there to cash out. 

The bar area was not packed with people, so we were very confused as to why the server couldn't remember to come back, or at least send someone else to check on us.

2901982,2013-07-29,2,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"My husband turned me on to Giuseppe's from having one of his vendor's take them here for lunch.  He had the $10 lasagna.  Needless to say, he was so full from the smaller $10 portion (as compared to the Mama D's portion $14.95 enough for two people+leftovers) but, he just couldn't stop eating it.  He shared this information with me and from there, we made our way to Giuseppe's about a week or so later.

We went on a Tuesday night.  On Tuesdays, they offer buy one get one free appetizers and desserts.  The dining room was packed, but did not need to wait for a table.  ALL of the staff were working hard to accommodate hungry diners.  The bartenders even came out of the bar area to refresh drinks and run food.  I could see the staff were slightly overwhelmed but, they all seemed to keep their cool.  It did take a little bit for our server to come to our table but, we totally understood the stress level he was going through.  

We order...BOGO appetizers, why the heck wouldn't we try more!  We ordered the garlic bread and mozzarella sticks.  The garlic bread should be avoided unless you like unbuttered, crunchy, boring bread.  The mozz sticks were a different story...  They were homemade!  Mozzarella hand-rolled in bread crumbs and fried near perfectly.  The marinara (homemade) on the side was very good too.  These are definitely worth trying!!

Since we ordered two Mama D's lasagnas, house salads were included in the price.  Salads were a nice appetizer portion with fresh romaine, chick peas, black olives, mozzarella cheese, croutons (store bought), and delicious dressings (we omitted tomato).  I had the white balsamic vinaigrette and the hubby had the Italian; both were delicious and homemade. Added brownie points for serving the dressings on the side.

At this point we are full or are fools for eating so much.  We grind on to our Mama D's Lasagna.  Wow!  The tomato sauce is very good because it is plain but flavorful (cliché?).  The lasagna itself has no sauce in the middle of each sheet; only a pork/hamburger mixture, or cheese.  Somehow, it works because even though you are already full, you keep stabbing your weary fork for more, and more, and more...  Several times during our entrée course my husband says to me, ""Are you gonna stop picking?""  10 stabs later I ask for a box.  

Fools are so full.  Remember, it's BOGO desserts too on Tuesday.  We order two of them to go :X.  We order the brownie cheesecake and strawberry shortcake.  Both were very good and worth ordering many more times.

Preface:
Giuseppe's is a 24/7 gaming bar/restaurant who get trivial reviews for some of their food and service.  But with that, the lasagna is some of the best I've had including Piatti's in La Jolla.  The mozzarella sticks, house salads, and desserts compare to some of Vegas' top restaurants. As for their other dishes, I cannot vouch for them yet.  Please try the lasagna!  Service is not top notch as others have mentioned but, when it comes to good eats, I'm more than willing to wait; good things take time...",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,4,3,4,cKxij_RyQXsWoypRcC--Gw

Last night I called in to this location to order a pizza to be delivered.  I couldn't remember which phone number I had originally used that had all of our information and the woman on the phone was audibly irritated by that fact.  Actually, she informed me, ""it would be much easier to figure out which number you have on record so I don't have to re-take all your information.""  Are you kidding me?

When the phone numbers I gave her didn't show up, she finally relented and asked for my last name, which is a fairly simple last name.  She couldn't get it and treated me like I was speaking a foreign language.  After she snapped at me, I feigned a lost connection and just hung up, intent on ordering a pizza elsewhere.  Just to reiterate, during that entire conversation, she had only received phone numbers and a last name...no order was placed.  That, however, didn't stop her from calling three of the numbers that had been given to her several times.  That aggravated me.  You'd think that since it was so inconvenient to have to deal with me over the phone that my hanging up would have been a blessing to her.  Is it because she didn't get the last word?

 The salads were really good as was the pizza. The bowtie pasta wasn't al dente and the sauce was kinda yuck. 8.00$ and it's totally worth it.

where do I even begin on the food? this place is all about quality! my twin and I were absolutely starving decided to order two dishes each and shared them together. 

Mr. G's Hoagie - the hoagie was stacked with meats and it had that true classic Italian hoagie taste to it. soo good!

Chicken tenders - these babies were on point! not overly breaded or fried. I could have eaten a hundred of those and still not been tired of them.

Insalada Caprese - mozzarella was so fresh. they even included a small arugula salad with some olives and artichokes. it was like 2 salads in one. awesome.

Rigatoni Italiano - homemade sauce had peppers and sausage in it which gave the dish an amazing hearty taste. we devoured that dish dry.

There were probably 2-4 other tables being served.  The service was great-- our waitress was helpful and friendly.  We were offered a sample of the pork and cabbage soup; the soup was flavorful and the pork was really tender.

The menu was pretty extensive-- salads, soups, pastas, pizza, fish, sandwiches, burgers. They had lunch specials ($7-9) along with a page of $10 specials.  I really didn't know what to order because there were so many choices!  It also made me a little nervous of which items are actually good.  I ordered the pan seared tilapia off of the $10 specials.  It came with pasta and sauteed baby spinach. I was hoping the sauce would be more clear rather than creamy, but I loved that they were generous with the capers.  The tilapia had a nice crust on it but had sort of a muddy/earthy taste to it.  I wasn't too concerned because tilapia sometimes tends to have this taste

The salads my co workers ordered looked pretty tasty.  The antipasta salad came with cured meats and the caesar salad came with a whole grilled chicken breast.  Another co worker ordered the wrap, but the wrap looked small with the huge pile of potato chips that came with her order.

Giuseppe's has great food, great service and great specials. I actually have to stop myself from coming here more often because the delicious pasta is just not conducive to keeping my waistline in a respectable range. 

The entrees are anywhere from $5.95 up to around $20 and the portion sizes are generous. Save some room for dessert. They have a cart they bring around to tempt you into getting tiramisu, cannolis, zeppolis, carrot cake, chocolate layer cake and other such delights. THE TIRAMISU IS ABSOLUTELY DEVINE! 

It seems like every night there is some sort of special: i.e., Monday night 5.95 steak special, Tuesday night: 2 for 1 desserts or appetizers; Wednesday night: Free bottle of wine with entree and Thursday night half off alcohol from 4p-11p. Also I heard on the 2nd Thursday of every month there is a wine tasting. I will have to try to catch that.

4014515,2012-03-07,0,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"That about sums it up for me.  Meh.  It kinda is.  Went here for a teenagers birthday party.  It was a joyous event, especially for the guest of honor turning 16!  Laughing and dancing was had by all.  Decent place to have a party that's on the smaller side (around 100 people).

But the food was just on the average, nothing I could find as special at all.  The appetizers were bland.  Chicken fingers with ranch, and breaded calamari with marinara?  Not the greatest because they definitely were from frozen and not from scratch.  Soggy bits everywhere.

The party had a buffet with a spread of some of Giuseppe's offerings.  I have to say though, none of it was really all that spectacular.  It definitely rang in 'bar food' for me...but not great bar food that you can find in other spots and watering holes.  It was just unimpressive at Giuseppe's.

Their Italian Chopped Salad had romaine, salami, capocolla, zucchini, gorgonzola, tomato, roasted peppers, and red onion tossed in the hour Italian dressing.  This was ok, on par with what you would find in lots of Italian joints.  It did get soggy though as the buffet line passed since it was tossed in the dressing ahead of time.  
On the buffet line was also roasted potatoes, fresh mixed vegetables, penne pasta wtih Giuseppe's tomato sauce, and  breaded chicken breast with peppers and mushrooms in a wine glaze.  All average, and nothing you couldn't have made yourself in your own kitchen.  Although I will say that their tomato sauce isn't bad, I'm hoping that they use high quality San Marzano tomatoes in their sauce but who knows!  Chicken was moist and tender but was lacking in the flavor department, nothing robust.

I think the best thing on the buffet line was probably the pizza Giuseppe's put out.  These suckers were huge sheets!  And New York Style.  You know I loves me some NY style pizza!  I had slices (actually squares) of their cheese and pepperoni.  Pretty good!  Crust was thin but crispy, sauce was tangy and sweet, cheese was gooey, and the pepperoni was salty and oily.  I've had better pizza but this was a bit of a Godsend because the rest of the food was not so inviting.

Giuseppe's is open 24 hours a day so going in for a meal anytime isn't a problem.  I think their problem might be getting repeat customers if their food isn't on par.  They offer a lot of Italian specialties on their menu, but I don't think I will be going out of my way in the near future to get a meal here.

They have great food and for the most part great service. Only a couple of times have we run into some extremely slow service while eating in the bar area. Haven't run into bad food yet (knock on wood!). Normally we try to catch the two for one appetizers on Tuesdays, but they have such a big selection we can't resist on other days. My most recent selection was the cran/feta chicken salad and I added my own touch to it with blue cheese. The marriage of the sweet vinaigrette and the tangy blue cheese is just outstanding to me. I have serious cravings of those two flavors combined. The salad also contained dried cranberries, walnuts and chicken. The presentation was nice and the chicken perfectly chopped. Not gigantic oversized slices like I tend to find. The portion was a little over the top. Maybe if my bf was there he would have been able to finish a salad that size, but I literally forced myself to eat as much as I could and I left miserably full. That is probably my favorite salad at the moment. 

Other items I've had the pleasure include the buffalo sliders, Joey d sliders, open face sandwich, cheese ravioli with Alfredo (which btw tasted as if they do the ravioli by hand and not frozen). The best cheese ravioli I have had, but again I ran into the portion size being too large for me. It's not like I eat like a bird, I am a pretty well built girl and I normally feel like I oink out. I just can't seem to finish my plate I guess. Maybe it's because I don't have my Deegan to share with me. Whatever it is, I end up wasting a bit of food. 

One thing I forgot to mention were the house made potato chips. We are all literally obsessed and not a single one of those will go to waste at our table. Sometimes the ladies get an order to go. 

If you're not a smoker, I would suggest NOT eating in the bar area unless you don't mind the smoke. Both ladies I eat with smoke, so normally I get ruled out on eating in the dining area. And being an ex-smoker I get it, but I have never enjoyed smoking and eating at the same time. Disgusting!",7S2wwOSVSRn4CEZdtQKG_Q,1,1,4,26BH-RbMMnjgOtSbqTA4-w

Where's a place that serves yummy Italian food at 1am on a late Sunday night/early Monday morning? 

Exactly... With some help from Yelp and Google, we find this place. I pick up a lady friend, whom I've just met, and we venture forth to fill our late night cravings of garlic and pasta. 

Giuseppe's is a standalone restaurant which seems to be surrounded by desert. We pull up around 1:30am to find a decent number of cars in the parking lot. After three sets of doors, we finally make it into this 24/7 bar and grill. A huge square bar stands in front of us after we enter the room. About 14 or so people are sitting around the bar drinking and some eating... You guessed it... Pasta!

We eye a spot in the corner and perch ourselves on the high bar stool and table. The friendly bartender, Mike, greets us from behind the bar and delivers his standard line, ""What can I get you guys to drink?"". We opted to look over the menus first, since that's what we were really here for. He lays down two menus and our adventure begins.

The offering is pretty extensive for a bar and grill. Appetizers, Specialties, Pastas, Soups, Salads, Pizzas, Burgers, Sandwiches, Steaks, Seafood options line the menu. Wow. Where do we begin? Ah yes, straight to the pasta section. Remember, we're looking for key words. Pasta. Check. Garlic. Check.

After a few moments, we are still unsure on what to order. Everything looks so good! We have a few dishes in mind but nothing set in stone yet. Mike comes by and we ask him what the specialties are. We tell him we are looking for pasta, garlic, and red sauce with a spicy kick. He recommends the Cappellini Pomadore and the Linguini Calamari. Funny. Those were two dishes we were both looking at. Done deal.

Since this was our first time out together, my guest and I had tons to talk about. Life stories, pet peeves, likes, dislikes, dreams, aspirations, and so on... And finally... The food arrives. Both dishes look delicious. Without missing a beat in our conversation, we both dig in and continue chatting.

The Cappellini Pomadore is Angel Hair pasta tossed in olive oil, roasted garlic, roasted tomato and fresh basil. We requested the red sauce on this dish have a spicy kick to it. The kitchen happily obliged.

The Linguini Calamari is pasta and calamari tossed in extra virgin olive oil, roasted tomato, fresh basil, and roasted garlic.

Both dishes were pretty good. Oh, did I mention each dish comes with a choice of soup or salad? We both choose the Minestrone soup, which was the special of the day.

Between myself and my guest, one of us was able to finish the dish while the other had to admit defeat and take the rest of the pasta home for another small meal. Due to myself being a gentleman, I won't divulge on who finished and who didn't. =) 

After our meal was done, we both sat around and conversed for the next hour and half. Hey what can I say? We both got along pretty well. What we weren't expecting was Mike, our bartender/server, stopping by our table and offering us two bottles of water on the house. He apparently saw us yapping so much, he thought we'd be thirsty. I thought that was pretty spot on service.

Earlier during our car ride to the place, I joked that my curfew was 4am since I had to work at 10. She, fortunately had the next day off. Our great conversation got the best of us. We looked at our clocks earlier and it read 2:30. The next thing you know its 4:15! Time flies when you're having a good time. We graciously thank Mike for being a great host and we head out homeward bound with a happily satisfied tummy.

Would I eat at this place again? Definitely. Would I ask the same girl out again? Definitely. Clearly a win win situation.

Oh, and before I forget, the leftovers were eaten for breakfast a day later. It was better tasting than at the restaurant. Go figure.",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,13,12,4,9QjjmSA9jcAF1iU3Q_AFpg

The manager was the worst. She trolled the restaurant the whole time and when she saw that we were looking to her to come ask how we were doing, she would make eye contact and keep walking. I saw her escape into the bar several times. Maybe it was to avoid having to look the patrons in the face.

5629054,2017-03-04,0,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"Wowwwwwwwww.
So, ok, pull up a seat as I weave this sad, sad tale of a family dinner gone so wrong. 

It's Friday night and my family (who rarely all have time or ability to get together) make plans to grab dinner together. We're seven adults and two pre-schoolers and we know this is a lot to foist on a restaurant last minute so we call Giuseppe's ahead and confirm they can accommodate our party for dinner. 
They can, they say, so we all meet at the restaurant and are seated relatively quickly. Waitress is friendly and takes our drink orders efficiently, bread arrives and a little while later we order.

It's all downhill from there, folks. 

Our appetizers (two orders of mozzarella sticks) take half an hour to arrive and the kids are getting hangry. Everyone has been filling up on bread because a few of us are just off work and starving. When the mozzarella sticks do finally arrive, they look good, but they're not hot. In fact, just barely warm to the touch. Everyone digs in anyway and continues talking. The bussers keep refilling waters and sodas and, after a while, we realize we've seen them more often than our waitress. It's coming up on a hour since we've arrived and no sign of food or waitress with any explanation. An hour passes and then an hour and fifteen minutes pass. Kids are getting tired and antsy. We're all hungry and watching the kitchen doors at this point. 
It's been way too long. 
When the food does start to arrive, it comes in one tiny burst. Two cold meatball subs and a lukewarm kids pasta come out, along with my dad's pasta and a mysterious plate of food the waitress immediately takes back into the kitchen.
Uh oh.
A few minutes later, she returns and tells my mom, apologetic: oops, they made her a turkey sandwich instead of a turkey burger...does she want to wait for a replacement? 
We've been at this place more than an hour at this point and my mom is a take one for the team type so she says she'll just eat the turkey sandwich. 

So, if you're keeping track, four adults and one child have their meals..or what have become their meals. That leaves three adults and a child waiting.
And we wait... silently hoping at least our preschooler's food will come out next. 
Another handful of minutes later (we're all looking at each other and the kitchen like, ""really? Wtf?"" during this time) and our preschooler's lukewarm pizza and fries come out along with two orders of soggy, chicken sandwiches next to cold fries. Cool.

Except, where's our last adult meal?
Oooops, the waitress tells us after disappearing into the kitchen for eons once again: there was a mix-up. They didn't make that meal but they're making it now with a vague promise of it being ready ""soon."" 
We can't believe it. Those of us who have started eating a bit, taking for granted that the restaurant wouldn't screw up again, stop eating. We wait.
We're tired. The kids are tired. We arrived at 6:30 and it's almost 9 at this point. We wait and then finally grab a busser and ask her to just have them get us all to-go boxes. The kids need bed and no one really feels like sticking it out anymore. Despite our best efforts, dinner has royally sucked. The food they managed to bring was cold, soggy, wrong or missing altogether. What a mess.

Icing on the cake? The waitress makes us wait another 10 minutes for the check (dining room is empty at this point) and then has the gall to charge us for the wrong order and the order that never came. It takes us another 15 min. to request to talk to a manager who makes excuses and finally offers to get us dessert! We all laugh, surrounded by our packed up kids meals and crumpled napkins. We have to suggest, strongly, that maybe the right thing to do here is to not charge us for meals we didn't order or receive. Luckily, he agrees and leaves us to our new favorite game: waiting for a waitress or someone to bring us our check and put us out of our misery.

Worst restaurant experience ever, guys. It's almost laughable. Needless to say, we'll never be coming back or recommending Giuseppe's. Stay farrrrrr away.",ozPXLw6rdip1jgS9Co5c4A,4,0,1,wiUNvMcayNcOBj2ZnJCIKg

5837920,2011-07-15,0,CZF9Nm8CFY2R9ZhfwYIARQ,"My wife and I made plans with friends, secured a reservation, and traveled to dine for the first time at Giuseppe's. Overall, I liked Giuseppe's a lot.

Ambiance was that of a rustic Italianate setting with comfortable, high-backed booths and nice touches like faux-exposed bricks in a wall and photos of narrow lanes of one or more towns in Italy mounted around the dining room. Our choice of appetizer, Fried Calamari, started off the meal on a very high note. The lightly battered squid rings (all were rings--no tentacles) were just excellent and enhanced by a homemade, sweet and mild Marinara Sauce and a creamy White Lemon Garlic Sauce; the latter tasted like a fine Lemon Aioli. I had to consciously hold myself back from gobbling up all these morsels of the sea, so others at my table could enjoy some too! 

After this, things got a little frenzied, primarily because I ordered more items than I needed, to be able to flesh out a more comprehensive review of the restaurant's offerings. Since no veal was available (only sometimes on a few specials of the day), I opted for Spaghetti & Meat Sauce plus one meatball and mushrooms, which came with a cup of the soup of the day or salad. I discussed with my waiter whether to order one or two meatballs, and he suggested one because of the meat sauce. Since there were also several small meatballs in my order of Wedding Soup, boy, was he ever right! I am a sucker for Italian Wedding Soup; next to Onion Soup Gratinee, it is my favorite soup. So, when I saw this on the menu, I just could not pass it by. And, because the soup of the day was an interesting sounding Stuffed Green Pepper Soup, and I love stuffed peppers, I ordered this, too. Plus, since a regular Dinner Salad or Caesar Salad came with my wife's order of Chicken Parmigiana, and she doesn't eat any vegetables other than potatoes, that was also going to be consumed by me--which is what caused traffic control problems at my table. 

After the empty Calamari plate was cleared, the Stuffed Green Pepper Soup and the Caesar Salad were delivered to the table next--which was fine, along with very good Italian bread and offered vinegar and oil. But I had to ask for butter twice before it came, and wait awhile for replenishment of my glass of Sprite and for the second soup. When the Wedding Soup did finally arrive, it was in a giant bowl that could comfortably serve four. Yet it was all mine. So, I quickly downed the Stuffed Green Pepper Soup, which was simply superb. This dish featured ground beef and well-cooked pieces of carrot and celery in a flavorful broth, and tasted exactly like a stuffed green pepper--except the soup contained small torpedo-shaped dissolini noodles instead of rice. It then took me awhile to eat the fresh-tasting AND LARGE Caesar Salad with its crispy romaine lettuce, croutons, and fresh Parmesan Cheese shavings that was finished with a very nice and smooth creamy Caesar dressing while the second soup was waiting. The only discordant note involving the salad was finding a small piece of the inedible bottom of the head of the lettuce mixed in with the greens. At least I saw it before I tried to eat it! 

I got halfway through the second soup, and the entrees arrived. But I can't really fault the restaurant for the pileup of food on my table. For, once I tasted the Wedding Soup, it was obvious that it had just been made from scratch in the kitchen. Therefore, it probably took as long to construct this soup as the spaghetti, meat sauce, & meatball with mushrooms. And, my dining companions had a right to be fed, too, without waiting for me to finish off all of my several ordered preliminary dishes. 

With tasty meatballs and large leaves of spinach floating in the very tasty broth, the second soup was also excellent.  But of course there was too much of it!  Even so, I wasn't going to let any of it go to waste, so I devoured it all. Surprisingly, my pasta dish was still piping hot when I began to tackle it. With its immense size and how laden it was with meat sauce, this imposing entree looked like a meatball-topped volcano of spaghetti that had recently erupted and discharged dark brown lava of meat sauce down its sides. It was the only dish of the night with which I was not thrilled, for on my first brush with the sauce it tasted more bitter than sweet. Real Parmesan Cheese was grated onto it by my friendly server, and the dish was still good--just not with as sweet a sauce as I prefer. But, at home the next day for lunch, I was pleased that any trace of bitterness in the microwaved meat sauce was all gone. 

Since everything was homemade, I just couldn't resist all of the tempting items presented on a large dessert cart. And, I'm glad that I didn't. For, a slice of Lemon Meringue Pie was fresh, very lemony, and delicious; just as were supple hunks of Fried Dough that had been sprinkled with sugar. 

This was a very pleasant and satisfying dining experience.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,2,4,iAwu7uyI5hBTylsxdmCrfw

Last week I stopped in Giuseppe's for dinner and noticed that they had Italian Beef sandwiches on the menu...so I asked the bartender, hey is this any good? I mean like really any good? He proceeds to tell me that they slow cook their beef all day - 1 point, make their own pepper relish - 2 points, and he felt it was pretty decent...so I decided I'd give it a shot...let me tell you...the beef was tender, the relish was just hot enough, and the au jus was perfect...

My attorneys will be contacting this establishment and their legal team on Tuesday. Their cameras will be subpoenaed for this. I am a business owner and I know how surveillance cameras work. My cameras have a 1 terabyte hard drive and record for a 24 DAY loop. Hey you, the a-hole who treated me like some piece of crap, you will have to answer for the inappropriate actions and demeanor that you presented to me. I was threatened and my liberties were unquestionably threatened by your words and actions. See you in court...and if Giuseppe's makes a conscientious decision to continue employing you, I will see them in court too.",FL4EIeq9EZLI2_ctARyhHQ,0,0,1,FZqb710q7xnlKsR3bVFNuA

Sometimes the service can be slow, but I always have great company so it doesn't bother me too much.  They also have a great room for hosting any large events.",jFgqYUxS-ZZYKkaNmUz9wQ,0,0,4,BqLH07P3ONevSi19Wdc1PQ
