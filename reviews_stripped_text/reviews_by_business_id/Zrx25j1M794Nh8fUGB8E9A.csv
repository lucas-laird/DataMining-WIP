This one inside The Orleans is great place to dine after or before going to the movies or bowling (or to gamble for the gamblers).",AuIK5tF2GjO7SftHawTLKw,1,0,4,0FcdLS7o6pQ4WPFooisfbg

Last weekend I had the opportunity to eat at this one and was surprised at some of the more recent TGI Fridays policy changes.  If you order a cheeseburger and want to change from Swiss to American cheese (or vice versa), it's a dollar upcharge.  We found out any changes (not just add ons) were a dollar upcharge.  Want an extra sauce?  it's a dollar upcharge.  I understand raising menu prices due to inflation and food costs, but the unnecessary upcharges seem a bit much.  There are a lot of similar restaurants in this genre.  If TGI Fridays keeps this up the other business's will be getting those customers.  As is, it will be awhile before my family will be willing to walk back into a TGIF restaurant.",OYPTqe2OiivMnoJmH3Mn0Q,0,0,1,6xTzTMwfp444bLm81G6D6w

We had salmon with lobster and steak with lobster.  No amount of steak sauce or ketchup could improve the taste of the rubbery food. These miserable entrees took OVER 35 minutes to arrive and were BOTH cold!  The waitress, Autum, had no explanation for the delay and did not return to our table to refill our almost $4.00 drinks! She further dragged her feet with with the bill. Took almost ten minuets to bring the bill and another to charge us.  The manager offered free desserts as compensation but I did NOT want to waste any more of my time or taste any other awful dishes from this establishment, which I will never return to.",aozfg1IZdHwLiNkOExKJzg,1,0,1,mONdF9coM0XM9vMT8FEuiQ

My gf and I are fans of TGI Friday and have been to multiple ones in Vegas. I just hate to say but the food at this one was not nearly as good as the other ones. We were disappointed because at places like this you look for consistency but this one wasn't prepared as well as when we went to the others. The service and everything were great which is why I gave it a 4 star but I will definitely just go to the other ones.",4S4N7D__JTZsm7Imnu9QvQ,0,0,4,5nxZmhWtDvjOoY25SmbA2Q
159014,2013-04-24,1,Zrx25j1M794Nh8fUGB8E9A,"My husband and I were in Vegas just last week, April 16-20, and we stayed at the Orleans, which is where this particular Friday's is located.  If I could, I would give a ""0"" star rating.  It will be a very long time, if ever, before we return.  

We decided to eat at Friday's on Friday evening, April 19, which was our last day in Vegas. After having a drink or two at the Alligator Bar, we decided we wanted something to eat.  We walked over to Friday's and it was only about 11:45 p.m.  We were the only 2 people waiting in line and the hostess was nowhere in sight.  We saw people cleaning up tables and mopping the floors, and finally a gal looked over and asked us if we'd like to be seated.  That should have been my first indication that the dining experience was only going to go down from there.  

We were seated, and Sara, a server, came over to take our drink order.  After a few minutes, she came back to take our dinner order.  My husband ordered a chicken dish and also a Caesar's salad.  Sara placed our food order and that was  about the last time she paid attention to us.  She totally forgot about my husband's Caesar's salad.  Evidently she felt it was more important to stand in the hallway and take pictures of some balloons that were up front.  Besides Sara, there were 4-5 other Friday's employees doing the same thing.  It was more important that they look at the pictures on their cell phones instead of paying attention to their customers!  

Considering the restaurant was hardly busy, we waited about 30 minutes before our food came out.  When it did, it was just absolutely horrible.  My husband's chicken dish was so salty he could barely eat it; and the cheese that covered the chicken was totally burnt in many places.  I ordered Korean tacos (I think that's what they were called) and I was not impressed at all.  Very little meat; too many greens carelessly tossed inside the corn tortillas; and it didn't look or taste anything like the way it was described in the menu. Right before our food came out, Sara came over to our table to tell my husband that she ""just realized"" she forgot his salad!  Of course she did, because the cell phone was far more important to her!  Thankfully, we were not charged for the salad.  

In the meantime, two more diners came into the restaurant.  They, too, were totally ignored by the employees.  Finally, the gentleman had to literally chase down a server and asked them if Friday's was still open!  Finally, after about 5-7 minutes, this couple was seated.  

By this time, my husband and I were so upset we decided that we needed to speak to a manager.  Sara came over to ask how our food was, my husband said it wasn't a good experience and he wanted to talk to a manger.  Sara did get the manager and we expressed our displeasure.  The manager was nice enough to not charge my husband for his dinner and she did give us some gift certificates for complimentary appetizers and desserts.  However, the entire experience left me with very negative feelings about Friday's.  

I don't know who does the training at this particular Friday's, but something is sorely missing.  Since when does a hostess station remain empty on a Friday night?  Customers should NOT have to chase down employees in order to get seated.  And the servers should not be standing in the hallway looking at pictures on their cell phones!  This is not ""service"".  After we complained to the manager, all of a sudden, the servers were doing their jobs.  It shouldn't have had to come to that!  Sara was one of the worst servers I've ever had.  If she's that poor of a server on a relatively slow night, I cringe to think how she is when it's busy!  Needless to say, Sara was not given a tip.  We do not tip for poor service and forgetfulness.  

We've eaten at this Friday's in the past and we always had good food and service.  What happened on the Friday night we were there was just inexcusable.  If Sara and company don't want to work on a Friday night, they picked the wrong industry.  I do not recommend this Friday's at all, unless you enjoy being ignored, forgotten and served sub-par food.  I don't, and that's why I won't be returning to Friday's when I stay at the Orleans in the future.  I'd rather get a bag of junk food from the Orleans' gift shop before I go back to Friday's!",rndSHtiaFqw5f3lQYtYSyg,6,0,1,bPcF3pqvPyIvsBARTMPPYA

Crazy how so much has changed anyways we were seated pretty quickly but it took our server 10 min just to great us and he's had very little menu knowledge . After he greeted us and grab our beers which were flat as hell we didn't see him for another 10 mins to take out order after our order was taken we sat there for 30 mins waiting for aSalad and a pasta dish  so we had the manager on duty come over and we discussed what had happened she couldn't care less so we just got up and left but know I see why the service is shit it starts with your management if they don't care you servers don't care and that's what we saw. Worst service I have ever gotten EVER!! Will never give this place my business again get your shit together and take care of you customers even if you don't care act like you do to make your customer feel more comfortable .

Food from the kids' menu is just as big as the normal entrees.  If you have kids, order the ribs for $7, and you'll get more than a half-rack of ribs for half the price.  

I ordered ribs and lobster.  The ribs were slightly overcooked.  I completely forgot that I was supposed to dip the lobster in the melted butter until we left.  I also tried the lobster carbonara pasta, which was the best out of all dishes.  The grilled shrimps from other entrees were nicely seasoned and grilled.

Once we sat down, the server was so friendly and accommodating. He asked us for our beverage of choice and quickly came back with them.  We already knew what we wanted to order and he gladly took our order with a smile. I can tell it was a very busy night for him but he still treated us with personal service. I would love to give him a shout out but he didn't have his name tag so I have no idea what his name is.

Bryan and his staff handled this situation beautifully and accommodated everyone so they could sit in the same room.  I know we were a very difficult group, and I appreciate the efforts of Bryan and his staff for dealing with us.  Thank you!",vECy_gXUuatiR2FHvzB44w,0,0,5,zau6IgEeCtax32j2xexKGQ

I asked my waiter to speak with her being that I seen her the previous night I was there which they forgot to put points on my account and she refused to come to my table (not a surprise because the night before my Fiancé and I waited 30 minutes for her to come to our table to redeem our free dessert coupon but she never came so our waiter eventually just went ahead and did it). Soon after our waiter attempted to get her, I seen her blatantly stand near the kitchen and watch him take our order clearly staring with the meanest look on her face. Eventually I stopped her as she walked past my table to ask about my points which she was not personable, extremely rude and not helpful AT ALL. You would think with her knowing I'm a repetitive customer she would show some sort of customer service. Instead of just saying ""I'm the general manager"" as if her title made any difference, if anything it made it worst! She provided no solution and as an Executive myself I was extremely blown away at how someone can treat there customers. I can only imagine how she treats her employees!

We asked the hostess if the appetizers were still half price at Happy Hour. She said they were, but neglected to tell us one has to be seated at the bar to take advantage of the half price offer. 

We only ordered one appetizer, and shared it: the shrimp cocktail... and unfortunately it appeared to have been made ahead of time as the shrimp were very dry. They weren't ""bad"", they were just dried out, which can happen quite quickly in low humidity and air conditioning. So it would have been OK at $5 for 11 smallish dry shrimp, but not OK at nearly $10. 

And unfortunately our friends ordered two appetizers (expecting half price); the potato skins and the dry shrimp cocktail, and also ordered a side of Onion Soup.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the steak and lobster special all four of us had. It was excellent. We all ordered it with a fully loaded baked potato and a side of Chef's veggies. The steaks were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. 

Our waiter was Chris, and he did his best for us in a crazy busy setting.

Our bill came to $41 (we only had water with our meals), and our friends bill came to over $75 (they had drinks). So in all the four of us spent about $120 plus a tip. The manager was not willing to adjust our bill for half price appetizers even after our waiter told him the Hostess failed to tell us we had to be seated in the bar. Oh well.

I used to be a waiter for a sushi restaurant and I've had my bad days. So we were compensated by getting different entree. By the time we got our food, we lost our appetite but still finished the shrimp pasta. We asked for our check to pay the bill. It took him 20 minutes to close our tab because he couldn't get his priorities straight. I recall having bad, clumsy days, such as putting entrees one over the other and end up squashing the bottom entree, spilling drinks, but I've never kept my patrons waiting. I would close out the tabs and let the patrons go so that new customers can come and take the seats. I would never come here again.

FOOD:  4/5.  We all had ribs with fries and coleslaw.  And at $12.99, it's tough to beat.  The only problem I had with the meal was the coleslaw.  I'm not sure if it was parsley or what, but it tasted weird.

SERVICE:  5/5.  Today (5/4/18), service was really fast.  Unfortunately, it's not always like that...they must've had ""hot n ready"" ribs.  I've been to TGIF several times before and they usually will take 20 min or so to serve your food.

AMBIENCE:  3/5.  It's inside the Orleans Casino and it's nothing special.  But, at least it was clean.

This Fridays capitalizes on the fact that it is inside the gold coast. Don't think your going to see and get what you typically get from a city Fridays. Add at least $5 to $10 more on the meals and you get less food. 

Secondly, you better hope you get a good waiter/waitress.

She said for a $1 I can get you a bread stick. I asked her to confirm that my $15 salad didn't come with ANY bread? Oh why did I ask that, she looked at me and said ""do you want the bread sticks or not!"" ..I just declined and ate my salad in silence.

  This T.G.I.Friday's is located inside the Orleans.  I came with my girlfriend and her brother.  Upon arrival there was no one in line.  I approached the hostess and she told me there would be a 10 minute wait if we wanted to have happy hour at the bar.  I gave her a confused looked as I glanced over to my right and saw 3 tabletops in the bar that were empty and prepped for the next guest.  I told her okay and sat on the 1 bench that they had for those who were waiting to be seated.  While waiting a couple came and was sat immediately in the regular dining area.  5 minutes after the couple's arrival, another group of 4 was sat immediately.  At this point, I was getting a little frustrated and just kept staring at the Hostess.  She stood there with two other hostess just talking amongst themselves.  She finally decided to seat us after  nearly useless minutes of wasting.  Within those 10 minutes, not one person left or entered the bar; so I have no clue what the wait was all about.  

  We mainly came here for a late night snack and enjoy some happy hour drinks.  Luckily our waitress was really nice and serviced us immediately.  She was very bubbly and had lots of energy.  If it wasn't for her, I would have definitely rated this place a 2 star.  The food was good and the happy hour prices were phenomenal.  

Pros:
* conveniently located inside Orleans (movies, bowling, dining, food under one roof)
* Open late and TVs throughout the bar 
* Quick service (at the bar)

Cons:
* Horrible service at the hostess stand 
* Unprofessional demeanor at the hostess stand.
* Difficult parking

Tips:  
* Ask to just sit at the Bar itself (not a table in the bar area) for faster      seating.
* Sign up for their email list to receive points for future discounts and also receive a free appetizer via email confirmation message.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but since the location is pretty convenient; I'll be fair and recommend this place to those who are not in favor or driving around kill the night.  This is a one stop shop and has numerous entertaining amenities to keep you busy and complete the night with cheap drinks/ cheap eats.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,1,3,yg8_W3SkyF1hZ7BOVRLhdA

The service every time has been awesome! Friendly, fast, and frequently fun. Seriously the service A+

So why a 3 star rating you ask?? Good question, to be honest the food is rock solid mediocre. Not bad, not great but always right in the middle. And it is not a bargain. 

Today for lunch I had a $12. Caesar Salad that was fine. In the past I have had BBQ, pastas. All about the same. Right smack dab in ""Meh""- The stand outs for me have been the burgers. They are always good. Cooked well, tasty, with a small side of fries. I suspect that is the answer, stick to the burgers.

Why go back is your next question, I don't have a good answer for that.

The booth we sat in, right in front by the hostess stand, was just caked with crud on the walls.  Just sitting there made me feel dirty...but we were hungry, it was late, so we stayed.  The service was absolutely the WORST I have ever experienced.  Anywhere.  Our (frumpy) waitress never refilled our drinks, I had to chase down the hostess to get another round.  We waited about 50 minutes for our food to come out, and it was typical Friday's salty nosh.  The chicken with cheese was ok, although my ankles were swollen in the morning (as usual when I eat at Friday's the night before) due to the saltiness of their food.  
After having to watch the degenerate gamblers and obnoxious loud fat people stroll in and out of there all night, we wanted to leave.  The waitress gave us our bill then disappeared.  I tried to flag her down, but we waited at least 15 more minutes.  We got fed up, counted out enough money to leave for the bill, and were even generous enough to leave her a $.17 cent tip.  I normally leave at least a 20% tip, even for crappy service, but crappy sevice is better than NO service.  This place needs better management...",GeRgStFIS3oBxkAiCIgwMA,1,0,1,7DOnMnGi4XNK6c3PDNTDBA

But don't be fooled, this location can get very very busy during peak times as well (aka any of the happy hours as well as during dinner time especially on Fridays and Saturdays).  The staff is unusually friendly for a TGI Friday's, but that's what you can expect in Las Vegas; a different approach to customer service.  From the time I walked in to order, to receiving food on a non-busy day, it only took a total of about 25 minutes.  I made the mistake of coming on a busy day to experience it, and had to wait in a line to check in, then another wait to get seated.  Every booth and table was filled, and that experience took almost 2 hours to get food.  Located in the heart of the Orleans Casino, this establishment is particularly loud so if you are looking for a quiet place to dine, this may not be for you.

Food is better than most locations as well and always served very hot.  Other locations I have had the unfortunate experience of asking to take food back due to being prepared wrong or too cold. No have never had a concern about this location.

Because it is part of a casino, it is loud, difficult to find if coming from the main doors and not parking garage, and you get an unpleasant scent mix of smoke, perfume, and food.  Doesn't affect the taste, just the smell.  The location is also fairly small so tables do feel cramped.  A few times I have been bumped into by those walking and sometimes by people pushing out chairs and under estimating the distance.  Bar area serves what you would expect, but for whatever reason it does seem to have slower food service than the standard sit down area.",xqu43YW0vd8txTf1FBEPcg,0,0,4,rxK6QgzAl1PM47lkCyH2xQ

Either a meal or just snacks.  We have always liked this spot.  Very convenient and friendly.  However there certainly seems to be a change, and it's not for the better!  We were in a bit of a hurry, there was a little bit of a line to be seated in the dinning room, so we chose to sit in the bar.  All we wanted was skins, a cocktail and an ice tea.  So we sat at a bar table, and nobody paid any attention to us.  So I got up and walked over to a lady behind the bar and patiently waited for her to take a quick break from chatting with an obvious regular customer.  She never acknowledged me, Laura went to another bartender and asked for someone to take our order.  She was rudely told that we waited because we sat ourselves in the bar.  The lady said she would send someone over, but sure made it seem like we were putting her out.  Laura mentioned her treatment to the manager, who spoke with the bartender (before we got our drinks... EEK)!  Sure seemed like the waitress thought we complained about her, because she  barely said a word to us for the first time or two she stopped by, but then warmed up and was OK.  So we asked to speak with the manager again, about the whole situation.  She apologized and made excuses.  I explained that we have been coming here for 5 or so years, and have always been treated well, but this time was certainly different.  I asked her if she ever looks at the Yelp reviews for her store, she said no.  They have their own review system and don't care about Yelp.  I told her she really should.  I explained that Yelp is HUGE now, and she could learn a LOT about her store.  Well the skins did arrive and they were OK, nothing to make us go out of our way for again.  Certainly unless Yelpers start giving this place a better rating we won't go out of our way to eat here again.

Bad idea : the same female bartender with red hair was there with her strange, rude attitude. 

Despite seeing her, I and my boyfriend sit at the bar and chat while waiting for the bartender to stop staring at her cellphone. Then she proceeded to polish things behind the bar despite our attempts to get her attention. 15 minutes later she walks over to us after I finally get her to look up and asks for my ID immediately before greeting us or introducing us. 

As someone who has worked in restaurants in NYC since the age of 16, I was stunned. I gave her my ID, then my order, which she makes a face at for some weird reason. She then took my boyfriend's order. We get our drinks placed in front of us and she walks away with an attitude. I guess she was taking her hate for her job on us? Not sure but it was weird.

She comes back out of nowhere and asks my boyfriend if he's from Chile and he says yes. Then she smiles at him coyly and gives me a dirty look - not sure why. So now she's rude & weird to boot- bless her heart. I can only imagine what her problem was but she was nasty for the rest of the night, especially after my man got weirded out by her flirting with him.

Forgot the soup we ordered. Offered us an order of chips and salsa after the table next to us turned it down. This waiter was completely out of it.

I say this, even after we had a misunderstanding with the restaurant and the front counter of the Orleans. But.... it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. Allow me to explain, we were given a food comp from The Orleans for $50. This was part of the hotel package that we received. We had put down a cash deposit for our stay... we did not use a credit card for this trip. Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m! So both employees at this point had made mistakes, but the mistakes were each based on the fact that there are not proper procedures in place for when a guest checks in with cash as a deposit, and is receiving a comp. Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out. The restaurant, apologized for the employee calling the room at such a late hour, the restaurant offered us a free dinner for the misunderstanding, and the server actually came to our table personally, and apologized profusely.  The manager on duty was very polite and very accommodating to us. And we were very thankful to him.

The food is generally good. The 3-6 steak and lobster ""bargain"" isn't really, you get about 2 bites of overcooked lobster tail. My biggest complaint is the dinner side salads. I always have a Caesar salad when I eat at any TGIFs - don't think I'll be doing that with this location anymore. Their dressing tastes like a lime vinaigrette... not disgusting, but not Caesar, either - and I always seem to get lots of the ""nasty"" bits of lettuce, which I leave in the bowl, it's just a waste to order a salad here.

We were seated right away, which is always nice.  We then waited at our table for 10-15mins for anyone to even greet us or smile our direction.  When our server finally arrived, the FIRST words out of her mouth were ""I'm exhausted.""  She then proceeded to complain to us about her last table as an excuse as to why we had to wait so long just to get waters.

We had enough time to decide what to order as we waited so long.  I decided to try the special the hostess told me about: steak and lobster for $13.99.  What I didn't know is that it was on a time limit.  The server had the nerve to look at her watch after making us wait 15 minutes and tell me I ""barely made it"" in time to order that.  I also order a cocktail at this time.

After waiting another 10 minutes, she finally brought my sangria followed by another 15-20 minute wait for our entrees.  Let me tell you.  This was the MOST unappetizing meal I've ever had to eat.  I am not usually a complainer--even when I'm starving I eat some pretty crazy foods.

The lobster was not ""de-turded (for lack of a better word)"" and my medium rare steak was too tough to chew.

When I walked in there was no one waiting for a table and 3 staff members standing around chatting. I said, I wanted to place a take out order. The young man pointed me in the direction of the bar and said at the end is where they take the orders from the bartender. 

Ok 1st of all its a SUNDAY in a CASINO in LAS VEGAS. the bar was packed. no seats at the bar or any of the tables. I hipped my way though the crowd and stood at the end of the bar. 

25 minutes. 

1 bartender. 

Who puts 1 bartender in a bar on a Sunday in football season in Vegas?  

I waited. 

and waited.

and waited. 

She talked to the service station people. she chatted up the people at the bar. she flirted with the guy who was sitting 3 seats down from where I was standing. she chatted with 2 girls who were standing next to me having a convo but NEVER once said.. CAN I HELP YOU. 

for 25 minutes. 

I had all my order prewritten on a green post it (so if anyone from this Friday's is reading you'll know who i was) 
Finally a woman in street clothing came behind the bar and have a few minutes of chit chat -- she (the bartender) pointed in my direction. she came over - not that she could hear me, so i gave her my list and asked if she could understand it.. THEN the bartender decided to come peek over her shoulder. I said.. Do you know how long it will take (thinking i'd sit in the lobby) she said at least 30 minutes.. I said well i've been standing here 25.  The bartender rolled her eyes and said.. we're really busy. 

Really?  I didn't notice. 

at which point i snatched my list back and left. but not before making a sweep though the dining room to count 12 tables. 

and the 3 staff members were back in the lobby chatting. 

Now my biggest issue is that who in the TGI Friday's corporate HQ thought it would be a GREAT idea for 2go orders being placed in a bar?  

to go - unless you are in NYC or SFO - usually means you are going to get into your car and drive. 

I actually ended up at a stand alone TGI Fridays about 3 miles away. again sent to the bar to order and this time very prompt service but the bartender kept coming over and saying are you sure you dont' want a drink? finally i said. drinking and driving don't mix.

Just having stadium nachos and three beers during a 3 hour game was definitely, not the end of my dinner plans for the night. My wife and I rushed over as soon as the game ended and sat in the bar. Our server was Ricky. He's a low talker for sure, but very nice, and knew what to say and when to say it. Fridays is just like every other commercialized restaurant around the universe. Old records, pictures, random rowing oars hanging on the walls, and constant striped patterns everywhere you look (probably even on the toilet seat covers). But they do have one thing that I was super stoked to see. They have a bell that you are supposed to ring if you received excellent service. Now, when I see a bell, all I want to do is ring it.....hard! I was hoping Ricky, would be killer in the service game, so I could ring that bell. Fingers were crossed.

To start out, my wife really wanted the ""Loaded Potato Skins""(refer to pic), which I have never had before, anywhere. So I figured, alright, I'm down. They weren't exactly ""Loaded"", or very good. Bacon, yes, is always good on everything, BUT.. the thing they go on still has to have flavor! It can't just be some semi-soggy, piece of cardboard. Anyways, no bueno on the skins. 

For our entrees, we both ordered the ""Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich""(refer to pic). The sandwich looked good, and came with (over)seasoned fries. The sandwich alone was pretty bad, but when you drizzle the delicious Jack Daniels BBQ sauce all over, it becomes pretty tasty! Not amazing by any means, but good. The fries that came with were just way over seasoned. They were so salty, I found myself shaking each one, trying to knock off all the seasoning, before attempting to eat them. During this ongoing battle with my food, Ricky brought both of us refills, made some small chat, and ended with a smile. I'm not big on complaining about food, and figured it wasn't that big of a deal at the time. 

For dessert we had the Chocolate Caramel, and Pecan Explosion (forgot the name, but thought this sounded awesome)(refer to pic). This dessert was actually very good. It put a nice, big smile on our face's. The chocolate brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream, and chopped pecans. Very moist brownie, covered in rich, flowing chocolate sauce. Nomnom.

Before we left, I had to ring that bell. Ricky was a good server, and I went for the bell. Let me tell you..., it felt so good to ring that bell, I would go back just for that feeling again. All-in-all, bell ringing is amazing and everyone should have a good bell ring daily. Head to Fridays for your bell fix today.",2iu0ciezoxRVlwI7llgicQ,1,1,3,L6Jx3n0oHLZilYuvd5pVyw

I am completely in shock still that they changed the potato skins. That is quite honestly one of the only things I ate here, and now will not return. The old potato skins were amazing. These new deep fried things are absolutely THE most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. There doesn't even taste like there is any potato in it, and the thick fried crust crap is oily and NASTY!!! There is the tiniest dollop of cheese now and maybe one bacon bit and the deep fried taste was disgusting. 

I figured I would give the boneless wings a try after refusing to eat the new so called potato skins. Nope. Even the wings had this horrid and truly bizarre deep fried taste that I've never had on a chicken wing. 

Needless to say our party hardly touched their food and went home sick. We all had awful stomach aches before we even left the restaurant.

They did have a happy hour that had different specials. $6 appetizers cept for seafood and samplers. $3-4 beers and well drinks, $5 sangrias and $6 ultimate drinks.

No balsamic vinaigrette. It was a plate with nothing but old brown wilting romaine lettuce. Come on... If you are going to bring me a plate of just lettuce at least let it be fresh and green!

We were going to just politely mention it to the host on the way out but he was nowhere to be found, my guess is his shift ended and he never told the next host about us. As far as service at the bar, it was friendly although somewhat slow considering that the bar was not very busy. I had been craving a frozen drink but the bartender said she was new and didn't think there was a menu with frozen drinks on it, but if I came up with something she'd make it. I did and it was fine, nothing special though and I just really would have liked to have some kind of specialty concoction at a chain like this. Our food was decent, nothing special though, and I realized after leaving that my appetizer was not discounted for happy hour, oh well. This was not a great experience and with so many other options in town I doubt I will go back.",BrKoAfW32omNcaFqW9pKsA,0,0,2,qFbEjcFHFl3pzFBR3F3T-A

It was my last night at the Orleans and I wanted to have some cheap before going back to the room. Walking around the casino, I saw TGIF, figured it's just like any other Fridays.

There was no wait so I just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area. Service was quick and I ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings. Food was on par like with any other Friday's franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce. 

Lucky for me I was able to charge it to my room so I cab earn some points for my stay.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,7,4,3,5YRmrWxxRfhU0ZEq2hJ4dA

Jeffrey was our waiter on a very busy Friday before Memorial Day. He was awesome. Brought water without even asking, and my biggest pet peeve, having an empty drink. Jeffrey brought a refill a little bit before my drink was even done. He was on point. 

The food, after seeing the reviews I got scared and just ordered a burger. I was completely surprised at how nice and juicy it was. It didn't even need condiments. The fries were a little bit over seasoned but still yummy. 

We even had dessert, something we never do. We got the fudge brownie with vanilla ice cream. Ah-mazing",rOWVL_iBDeYNQ7TELAE-gA,1,1,5,blMMjojokFuI1Hlm95FuAg

Waitress was pretty good but the atmosphere of an older group staring@ me & my husband was akward. Is it cuz we r interracial? Got more food than u? Idk... but made me u comfortable. Went at 1am btw. And all potato skin orders had @ least 1 rotten skinned spot on a potato. Not too good wont suggest that to anyone. Beach bum drink (alcoholic) sucked. Mostly pineapple juice & no garnishes.

I like soup and salad along with my meal and I REALLY wanted salad with blue cheese dressing. Turns out they are serving a ""new White Cheddar Broccoli soup"" which is one of my favorites. Soup should not plop, should not be goopy and shouldn't look like someone just opened campbells cream of mushroom and dumped it cold into your bowl. Yes, it was hot, but still that is how it looked and it tasted like overly salted canned soup. I guess you can't mess up lettuce but the ""blue cheese dressing"", pretty sure that was straight mayo. For these two items, which tonight were all I ordered, they were TERRIBLE! I paid my tab and left after two bites (one of each).  I have had other meals here that were okay, not superb or even great but mediocre. I just think that the basics should be considered.",1vUfFZJ1BfYtorPWAAckfw,0,0,2,r4Q34UKXJ2XKy5Sq0jtdWg

Because it was ""happy hour"" I got the French Onion soup ($3) and we split the ""inferno"" chicken wings ($6). Sarah got some sort of salad ($?). 

The food came out relatively quick. The soup was kinda bland and the chicken wings, although red as blood, weren't that spicy. I like my spicy food to at least make me feel like I need to dab my nose with a napkin. I love spicy food and I would say these are more of a ""mild"" wing.

There was a pretty long line outside waiting for tables (both dining room and bar) but it went by fast. We sat in the bar area to have the Happy Hour specials. $6 apps, $5 sangrias, $3 bottled beer. 

The Food: We got the pretzel sticks, pretty yummy, I think they were fried, which is different than I am used to, but I still liked them. Potato skins were yummy, good sized and there were a ton of them. Loaded skillet chip nachos were delicious, loved the cheese. 

The Drinks: Raspberry Sangria, pretty sweet, definitely needed food to help balance it out, but I enjoyed it. 

The Service: Everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very nice. Waitress was very attentive and checked up on us several times.

No complaints with their overall food, once you know what you like there.

Personal favorite is their Jack Daniels ribs. We always get the full size so we can have it as leftovers as well.

At the end of their menu, they also have a value menu, for those of you (like me) who don't eat very much in one sitting and want to save on amount of food + pricing.
