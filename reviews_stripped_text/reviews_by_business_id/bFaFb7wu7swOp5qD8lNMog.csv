I came around 1:30pm, so i found parking immediately but i understand it could be troublesome at this plaza to find parking.  

It was my first time and it was a great experience.  They served green bean soup as a drink (taste ok) which is different than the other places.  I ordered the beef noodles soup.  Noodles and the soup are prefect!  They also have a paper on the table to educate you about their food and the drink which is nice to know.  

Price was decent between $9 to $10 for a bowl of noodles soup.",PtU909CdR4BFbMp9Dj0zEg,0,0,4,7W3OJQ8-lTIvJbrETJTgSQ

We accidentally arrived this place and decided to give it a try. This is a small restaurant but is very clean. The staff here are very friendly. They have cool mung bean soup in this hot summer day for free and refill instead of ice water. They also brought in Sichuan pickles as our appetizer. The pickle was authentic, not like Cantonese styled. Their Manu is short but every single dishes are tasty just as it is supposed to be. We ordered spicy sour wonton, house special rib noodle and Chengdu minced meat noodle. All tasted fabulous!  We definitely will come back.

Their soup broth very flavorful. I only tried the Hauxing Fried Egg Noodle, but it had a great tomatoey flavor to it. But what really blew me away about this place was their Chili Oil Chaoshou.

This place is nice and comfy when you walk inside and it's nice to sit in the semi-private booths. The menu is clean and simple. I tried the wontons and their noodles with ground pork.

They give you a big bowl of noodles and the broth is flavored nicely, albeit spicy. However at the end I realized I was still quite hungry, so really you're not getting enough bang for your buck. Yes you can order more noodles but by then you're out of meat and veggies to go with it.

the staff is a little bit awkward, but are attentive and very helpful. the place itself is small and clean. the drawings and messages past customers write are very cute and unique. 

food: so my boyfriend hates the numbing spice. I don't mind spicy but my stomach minds it. a lot. so every time we order, he requests no numbing spice and I request less spicy. both of us are content with our foods every single time! my favorite item is the house beef noodle less spicy and it's the perfect amount of spice for me every time. 

also, I could live off of that mung bean soup. I'm not kidding. it pairs with their noodles so well. I just can't. 

the only thing we were slightly disappointed in was the steamed egg because it had little to no flavor. the texture was amazing, but it was pretty ""eh"" to us. but that's ok, I just want noodles and soup and we good.",5uuE8Gm7m4YfMI6vfTUHQA,0,0,5,NK088ml_4EnQooODb4v63g

chengdu zajiang noodles with soup (4.5 stars)- this dish was not spicy with ground pork and thin noodles. We were informed that if we wanted more noodles we could get them free of charge. Dish was pretty flavorful and included some veggies as well. 

hot and sour chaoshou (3.5 stars)- same spicy soup as the hot and sour noodle soup dish. This was good with some spiciness to the dish, but if you order the hot and sour soup I wouldn't order this dish due to the same flavors. 

Chili oil chaoshou (4.5 stars)- we liked this dish better chili sauce at the bottom you mix the dumplings in. 

Service (2.5 stars)- we asked for a re-fill on the mung bean tea and were told to ""hold on."" The server never came back and re-filled the tea. Also took a long time to order dessert. We had to flag down the server and shout across the room to get their attention.

1352523,2017-10-24,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Came here for lunch on Monday after running around for smog check and hair cut (which both didn't happen btw because smog check had 3 cars ahead and my hair stylist was out of town till Tuesday)

Incidentally i was in the main Chinatown plaza (for the haircut) and decided to come here for lunch. I got lucky and found parking like right in front of the restaurant (everyone knows parking sucks in this complex). After i went into the restaurant, all the side tables were occupied. The waiter asked if I would be willing to sit in the big table in the middle with others, and i was fine with that. 

Fastest lunch ever. I was in and out of the restaurant in like 15 - 20 minutes. This was about 0100PM on a Monday afternoon. I was sat at my seat, given the menu, gave my order of the Piquant Intestine Noodle with extra noodle, got my food, ate, and gone. 

Like the menu picture shows, the Piquant Intestine Noodle gives you some bak choy, piquant intestine, and noodles. Very simple but flavorful noodle soup. Not sure what piquant intestine means but from my experience in eating intestines, it was like, mini large intestines. I had wished they had used normal sized large intestines as they are much ""meatier"". The soup base at a ""normal spiciness"" is pretty decent. Had a good amount of ""ma"" and ""la"" which is the numb and spicy aspects of chongqing/sichuan cuisine but was not overpowering so i was able to eat my noodles fast. Price wise, it was great. I think my bowl of noodles were $8.99. With a free 100g side of extra noodles, it was a good amount of food for my hungry self, since i haven't really ate since 0630AM that morning. Not sure if it was because i was able to eat much faster than i did last time (not status post night of drinking and dehydration), the noodles didn't really soak up the soup as much as it did last time. 

Service was quick. Unfortunately they didn't refill my cup of mung bean soup. Since the ""visit"" was so fast, it didn't really bother me too much. 

Would like to come back to try other noodles like the spare rib noodles, special gizzard noodles.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,0,4,9_kRc8bqWKxJQ0DmAPRmiA

Staff 4/5
Food 3/5
Likeliness to return 2/5
Likeliness to recommend 1/5

Location and ambiance:
Located in a busy plaza on Sp.Mt. that typically already have huge issues with parking.
- the restaurant is very half assed and unfinished.  I understand they removed all the booths/ decor from the previous tenant. But they didn't bother covering up any holes or patch up the walls with new paint. There's several hanging lights missing. Personally to me.. if a restaurant is new, I expect it to look like the previous tenant cuz it's reusable or something new and turn key.  I don't wanna dine in a place that looks like someone just moved out.

Staff:
Staff is friendly and nice.  We were greeted promptly and water and comp appetizers arrived right away after we sat down.  My only complaint is the staff is constantly on their cell phone. They are super nice and polite when you get their attention but they're not very attentive on their own.

Food:
We ordered the steamed egg with minced meat.  Came out super fast.  A little too salty for me but my husband thought it was good.  
Then he ordered the first thing on the menu, pig intestines noodle.  All we tasted was the heavy peppercorn and no other depth of flavor coming through.  My husband had to ask for soysauce and vinegar to tweak it.  I ordered the Hot and Sour Noodle which was tasty and I loved the thin homemade noodle texture. Doesn't blow my mind, but it was a good choice.

Likeliness to return:
For what it is, we're probably not going to return.  So far there isn't a flavor that I crave.  However, it's not terrible so should any friends wanna dine here we wouldn't refuse.

Likeliness to Recommend:

To top it all off, they serve a wonderful mung bean soup as a beverage that cools the tongue from the intense Sizchuan spice. Trust me though, I'm no slouch when it comes to spice, but the ""less spicy"" option was still VERY powerful (almost left my mouth numb). Only opt for the true spicy options if you are are a Sizchuan native or a literal masochist.

The beef soup had exceed all expectations. The soup was flavorful and the beef was tender. My mom ordered the Ma-Lat noodles.. and boy does this dish live up to its name. First sips had my entire lips numb and tingly. Apparently the Szechuan pepper do that to you. The soup base on both dish was on point. Can't wait to come back!

We also ordered 2 appetizers. The radish was just okay for me, although my mom loved them. Some of the radish were too hard to chew. The fungus, on the other hand, was the best fungus dish I've ever had in my entire life. I'm a huge fan of vinegar - and this dish had the perfect combination of sour and sweet similar to pickled fungus. 

For desert, we ordered 2 of the sweet jelly. This was definitely not something I've ever had before. If you like nuts - I definitely recommend this. Otherwise, if you're not a peanut lover like me, don't order this. 

Ohhhh and how can I forget the kung bean soup!?? This restaurant serves kung bean soup for your drink! No need to order water -- as this soup will help cool your mouth from the burning sensation from the spicy noodles! The mung bean soup has a hint of sweetness to it, and the fact that mung beans are good for you - make this place a top contender for me for favorite noodle restaurant in Las Vegas!

The noodles and beef were really good, but the soup was a bit much for me personally. I'm sure other people who love really spicy chili oil or this type of food would love it, it's just not my style.

Price was decent, I think our bowls were about $9-10 each which wasn't overpriced or a great value, just in the middle. I will say the amount we got was good, no complaints.

Steamed Egg - 4/5. Standard steamed egg with some sauteed shredded pork thrown on top. The pork was a nice touch bumping this up by a bit, since the sauce paired well with the unseasoned egg.

Their hot spice was different. Can't really feel the hot from spice but you can feel you get hot from inside out and it make my nose runs . I also notice my mouth feel slightly numbed after drinking the cold munbeans drink
Noodle soft chewy, meat & intestines was tender, dumplings dish sweet and spicy , need to share the dumplings since the sauce soak in chili oil , more sweet then spicy and I feel it would be sickening for one person trying to eat all that dumplings by self",0LA8IYqeyK-GrSZybFy42g,0,0,4,AkOvwHmCBHnsWLv4zFCMmg

Flavors are on point. Their house drink is the chilled green bean soup. It's a desserty drink, a stable in China like boba tea. I used to drink it all the time back home during the long summer breaks. I was so surprised and excited to discover it when I first came to the restaurant. The waitress was kind enough to make me a to-go drink of it. Lol. 

The fried egg is Chinese style with edges of the egg (and usually bottom) super charred. Damn, everything in the bowl reminds me of back home. Must try.",M2whdwvMtNxLllxOvt7cOw,0,0,5,1wqnW-2HENIEZeAej_pEEw
1993793,2017-09-14,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Came here late one night after work because my sister wanted to try this place. The place was very nice and clean, bright lights, I like that the tables are sectioned off which gives you a little privacy. 

I really liked the mungbean ""soup"" that they served instead of water, it supposedly helps cool your body. The soup was served cold, not too sweet, very refreshing. 

My sister wanted to try the intestine noodle which they said were sold out, then she wanted the short rib noodle which was also sold out. So she decided on beef noodle which she really enjoyed. Said noodle was chewy and tasted fresh, broth was flavorful. I was not in the mood for spicy food so I got the wontons which I really liked. The soup was plain, not bland, plain...which tasted very healthy, perfect for late meal. The wontons were flavorful so I thought the overall dish was great, the plain broth complimented the flavorful wonton. I would definitely come back for more and to try other dishes. 

Cons:
- They did not have the two dishes that my sister came to try (I personally feel that when you are new you want to be on point and have your most interesting items in stock all the time so everyone who comes in can try your best items)
- The menu was wrong all over the place, they have the same description for different dishes which is misleading when it is your first time there and is trying to know the menu
- Service was also not the best, I did not come here expecting excellent service but we waited a long time and had to flag someone down to get the check

Overall, really good food, service needs improvement. Maybe you should come early if you want to try their popular items.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,3,2,3,S-5mcJyNzKdOX_mkuthxEQ

We got there before they open in ten minutes, we waited in car until they open and look at menu from the yelp app. Within minutes the sign was flip to open and doors were unlocked, we headed in to be seated. At first, I thought it was nice and since my friend suggested about this place, why not give it a try. 

Overlooking the menu, I decided to get the house beef noodles soup and cold noodles(I don't remember the name exactly but it was cold and spicy). They also served mung bean soup (which is similar to the Vietnamese ché do san) everything was great, the place paper has drawing and side notes on how to eat the noodles. Until my friend pointed out on their whiteboard about getting a free appetizer if you follow and comment on their yelp page. Which I already done checking in but thought it was nice of them to offer free appetizer, so here we are looking at the menu under the section; trying to figure which ones until the server came by and we asked him about it. He pointed out these small black dish in the middle of our table. Not sure if it's picked cabbage or vinegar. Our faces were blank and just arched our brow. Okay?? 

We just order our food, my order was house beef noodles and cold noodles. It was good. Spicy and the broth was flavorful. Will I ever go back??? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. They do have one in Los Angeles so I might go try them out and see.

- sliced spicy beef: it was alright. It was indeed spicy but it was too dry for me
- Steamed egg with minced pork: this was my favorite one! Egg was smooth and the minced pork had a nice subtle sweet flavor to it. 
- spicy back fungus: this one was alright also. It was spicy but they also put too much vinegar in it and that overpowered the spiciness. 

Noodles:
- Spare rib soup and Spicy house beef soup: both soup had the same broth (at least they tasted the same to me).  The soup itself was okay. It had a layer of chili oil on the top which is expected in Szechuan cooking. I wasn't a big fan of the meat in each dish. Both the spare ribs and chunks of beef felt rough.

Beef noodle soup has a close place to my heart and it's one of the best I've had to be honest. My family and all ordered the beef noodle soup with all various spice levels from baby spice, to liu kang bicycle kicking you in the throat. They also serve a mung bean ""soup"" to accompany the delicious fire water that we were about to eat. Sichuan peppercorns really numb you up. They probably lowkey use it when you're at the dentist probably. While that sensation is going on, the noodles were good, and so was he broth. I highly recommend the sweet savory dumplings. Whatever sauce they had I would get lost in the sauce real quick.  Overall I was dying and I felt like I could breathe fire.

2177067,2017-10-31,1,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"I was craving noodles and this spot popped up under Hot n New so I decided to check this place out with a couple of friends. I know that Szechuan restaurants tend to mainly have spicy dishes, so I enjoyed the fact that u can order mild to medium spicy level here. 
They start out by giving everyone this drink which is Mung Bean Soup. According to the menu, when you eat something really spicy....this drink will help tame your taste buds....it really works and is refreshing (better than water, and Ill tell you why later).  Our table ordered Spicy Black Fungus- great appitizer/side dish.
Spicy Radish- too hard, difficult to chew.
Chengdu Zajiang Noodles- dry noodles with egg and minced pork
Intestine Noodle Soup-different kinda flavor goin on here.
Steamed Egg with minced pork on side- delish and good amount for price.
Hot and Sour ChaoShou- broth was soo good!
Side of Spare Ribs- ehh plain.
As you know szechuan dishes are packed with flavor and spices and a little oily. As I am eating....Im thinking to myself my tongue feels weird. I told my friends that my tongue feels weird...maybe its oily.....oh wait it feels numb. For a second I thought I was allergic to something, but then my other friend said he felt the same thing hahahahah. I drank some water but that tasted weird as hell. I was like....why does the water taste funny. My other friend said their water tasted bomb. Then my other friend told me that sometimes szechuan food sometimes makes your tongue feel numb from all the spices. OHHH makes sense now! Here is when the Mung Bean Soup comes into play. I kept drinking that and it tasted pretty good to me since my taste buds were all outta wack. It tasted better than water! So thats my experience here. I dont know if I would purposely come back, but Im glad I got to try this place out. Staff is friendly, food comes out quick after ordering. Its located next to Tea Station. Parking can be difficult to find esp for dinner time or weekends.",dAfdS9l7DOMze3orptDxiQ,0,0,3,44LNe37snEUjkVCdq54mqA
2209641,2017-09-18,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Are you ready for that spicy, tingly, feeling on your lips and taste buds? Time for some authentic Sichuan (or Szechuan) cuisine! Here at Mian you're first served some mung bean soup as a drink to help cool your tongue as you prepare for your spicy dish. It's a subtly sweet, refreshing beverage w/ small mung beans (think similarly to boba).

Their menu is 90% spicy dishes, so if you're not into spicy food, this may not be the place for you. I ordered the House Beef Noodle Soup ($9.99). Don't forget to read their placemat on how to eat their dishes - it'll give you the best experience when grubbing down. The noodles were nice and firm, al dente, and the broth was spicy and had those special Sichuan peppers that made your lips and tongue tingle. I couldn't help but smile and feel the endorphins from the capsaicin rush. However, their beef was overcooked and tough to chew on. It took away from the experience and I preferred not to eat it, even though I did because I don't like wasting food.

I'd definitely come back here and try their other dishes. It's another great place for a culinary adventure.

Tips:

* If you easily get heartburn or flaming hot @$$, don't eat here. It's mostly spicy food.

* If you don't want to eat spicy food, they do have 2 bone broth dishes.

* When eating any spicy noodle soup, make sure to stir the noodles all the way to the bottom of the bowl when serving yourself each time. It ensures absorption and capturing of the Sichuan peppers in between the noodles for each bite.

* Remember you're in Chinatown. You're not gonna get Guy Savoy service here.",RDtoAKtFjv632JvVtguMZw,3,3,3,HlO453XEqsuuTksuQQmlDQ

Other than that the noodle is very nice and just the right chewyness. I will definitely come back to try more other types of dishes.,bvHu6kqz44z9obSCQDLPfQ,0,0,5,5QZeXQYpTl7aK8YY5iQNQA

Server was friendly answered all our questions, and the food came out quickly. The two of we tried the spicy wonton, spicy radish , steam egg thing with mince pork? the steam veggies, and the spare ribs noodle soup.

The spicy radish was very flavorful picked with Sichuan pepper numbing to taste! Good experience if you never tried numbing pepper before!
The steam egg with was very very salty though.

I usually love noodle soup, but the spare rib noodle soup was good, but not the best I have had. The noodle itself was very fresh, the soup based was not so impressive.

We came in on a Friday night and there were only 2-3 other tables occupied. The clientele is mostly all Chinese so you know they're doing something right. As soon as we were seated the waitress brought us mung bean soup and pickled vegetables. The mung bean soup is used to cool off your mouth after eating the spicy foods. It tastes like iced tea but has beans in the bottom of it that sort of resemble split pea soup. It does work to cool you off so use it. No one is drinking water here. 

To start we ordered the steamed egg with minced pork which is seriously amazing. The pork is oily and savory while the egg is light and creamy. Definitely suggest getting this dish. After that we both ordered the house beef noodle. The dish itself is just gorgeous: a mix of white noodles, green vegetables and red soup.The noodles are less springy than ramen noodles, but taste fresh and almost floury. It filled me up a lot quicker because they were more dense. The broth is light but intense with flavor and heat. We usually go for super spicy ramen but we did a ""regular spicy"" here and I'm glad we did. The thing that I was not expecting was the tingling that happens in your whole mouth after eating the food. It's not like your mouth becomes numb from the heat, it's that the Sichuan peppers actually cause a tingling sensation. Drink mung bean soup to alleviate some of the tingling. The meat in the dish was very tender but a little fatty at times. I think this is a great intro dish. Next time I'd love to try some of the noodle dishes without soup. Overall I'm glad we tried Mian out. It's always exciting having new food experiences like this and I recommend to anyone who likes ramen and wants something more adventurous.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,0,4,vpVivVxv8JgbsKub6oHRlg

The dark beef broth was saltier and less sweet than some of other beef noodle soups that I've had.  Very flavorful.

The beef pickled noodle had a distinctively different broth.  Light in color, but heavily seasoned with numbing spice (peppercorn), which the waiter did warn us about.   And he wasn't kidding! Both my wife and I couldn't feel our mouths after a few bites.  The broth flavor was good, but we probably would've enjoyed it more if it had less peppercorn.

For my first visit, I tried their chengdu style zhajiang noodle with a side order of chicken gizzard. The noodle was cooked perfectly; not too soft, not too chewy. I asked for regular spicy level and found that it had a slight amount of heat, which kept building as I ate more. However, it wasn't too spicy, where it would make it hard for you to eat. I've had sichuan style food that's way spicier where it literally numbed your tongue and made you sweat like crazy. The noodle dish from this place didn't do that to me, so if you like super spicy food, the regular heat level might not satisfy you, so ask for extra spicy. The chicken gizzard was tasty (though it was not a chicken gizzard only, but is rather a chicken giblet) and was actually spicier than the noodle.

They gave you plenty of food and I was struggling to finish my bowl, but if you do need more food, you can ask for extra noodle for free. For drinks, they gave us sweet mung bean soup, which helped cool off the heat and which they would refill.

The only downside is this restaurant is located in the same small plaza, where tea station and ichiza are, so parking can be a challenge during busy time. However, you can always park at the bigger chinatown plaza next door and walk over.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,0,0,4,flTWhIgwhZTo6zr74zjkwQ

Ther jia jia mien noodles were disappointing.  The sauce was great, but the noodles were either a different story.   Either the noodles were overcooked, cooked in a pot with too much starch, or needed to be rinsed, because the noodles ended up with this gummy consistency.

So I asked for a side of the chili and peppers and added a good amount to my dish. The flavors were way better with the spice. Since the noodles were not cooked with the spices it was not as spicy as it should have been.

I ordered the chengdu zajiang dish which was pretty tasty and is a chef's choice! The noodles had a good amount of chew factor and the broth in the dish added plenty of flavor. They could have given a bit more meat and veggies with the dish, but overall it was a good dish. Eating it kind of reminded me of spaghetti with ground beef...just without the marinara sauce.

Another cool thing about this place is that you get this mung bean drink that is really refreshing, cool, and has a hint of sweetness to it. This is meant to help you cool down from the spicy dishes, but it is pretty good even if you don't eat spicy food like me.

1. egg custard and minced pork - must eat the custard with the minced pork for a balanced flavor.  We ordered a side order of plain noodles and mixed this appetizer with the noodles for our toddler and she loved it.

4. side of radish - spicy and good to have with the dry noodle.

The cold mung bean soup was a lifesaver..as you can see above, majority of the dishes are made with the Sichuan pepper, that spicy that tingles your tongue.  I am surprised as how much flavor is in the food since one would think the spiciness would overwhelm the dish...but NOPE!

FOOD: Menu is not very ingredient specific. It only tells you 3 out of the 6 ingredients so beware if you're vegetating. Presentation is also poor, mine looked as if it had already been stirred for me. 

Hauxing Fried Egg Noodles was served with thin noodles which I enjoyed and seemed to be vegetarian but because it was not marked I'll assume the broth was a meat broth. It was tasty and had almost a tomato soup style broth with a fried egg on top, tomato chunks and green onion. I don't know that I would this one again as I prefer clear broths but it was definitely tasty! 

Chili Oil Chaoshou is a none soup dish. Just steamed dumpling sitting in a yummy bath of spicy chili oil was fantastic, although I wish the menu said what type of meat it was because I have no idea what I ate now. Otherwise the tastes were fantastic and was not over steamed. 

ATMOSPHERE: Very plain inside, there is nothing on the bare white walls. There is one little tv in the wall turned off that looks to be the same one as the previous tenant. The only other decorations are two of their soup cups by the restaurant entry. It also looks as if there is the same brown wood furniture as the previous tenant. 


STAFF AND SERVICE: Very friendly staff however not a very good flow of who handles customers walking in and those dining. We were approached by someone from the register and given menus while we stood at the door along with 4 other people waiting to dine. Upon entry there is a clip board with lines on it hanging so you can write in your party name and how many dining. Once seated they brought soup and water out immediately after being seated and the food came out very quickly which was great for the lunch hour. I definitely could have waited an additional minute if it made the appearance of my dish better though. There's no fun instagraming it as their place mat suggests if it's a messy bowl of food.

3665314,2017-11-11,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Warning: Szechuan spiciness is very different from the normal spiciness that we see in other cuisines. The heat coats your tongue, giving you that numbing feeling and heats you up from the inside over time. It's different from other spiciness where you feel the kick right away, even burning your lips if you get the sauce on it; therefore, be mentally prepared if this is your first time experiencing Szechuan cuisine.

With that being said, this place captures that burning flavor so well. They let you choose your spiciness level in each dish, I'd recommend starting out with 'mild' if this is your first time.

I ordered the house-beef noodle and I was not disappointed. The noodles were amazing and the broth that accompanied it was delicious, best I've had so far in Las Vegas.

In addition to the delicious spicy meal, the restaurant offers you a mug of mung-bean soup, which you consume like a tea, which helps to cool down your body temperature after your meal. 

It's great that the customers are offered these drinks; however, it's also where this restaurant loses a star from my rating. The mung-bean soup that we're given were very little in quantity, it did not even fill up past half-way in the mug. Often in restaurants that I go to, the drink cups are fully filled, or comes within a big container for the customer to fill themselves. With the mung-bean soup being such a vital part to the meal, I'd expect the restaurant to give its customers a fully-filled mug.

Overall this restaurant is a great place to stop by to experience the burning essence of Szechuan flavor, perfect for cold days in Las Vegas.",U9bS4dP6jDdW8Ma1anD9Aw,0,0,4,7qG90LXXcMi5ETZDowAPUw

Spare rib noodle: i love spicy food, but it's kind of overpowering. Kind of like if you dumped a whole jar of chili oil in it, its not spicy but the flavor is too much. The noodles and bok choy were cooked fine. The noodles are similar to ramen noodles. The spare ribs tasted different, almost a gaminess kind of flavor. Not the flavors I was expecting.

Pickled beef noodle: this is a weird dish. It's kind of like a strong rosemary flavor, but the aftertaste numbs your mouth and is not a good feeling. The noodles were cooked fine, but I could not get past that rosemary numbness.

Coming in, we were seated right away and was given the full presentation on how we should order our foods and eat in the way it was presented. There is a paper place mat that has instructions on it to show us how to eat designed by their culture on eating Sichuan noodles.

I went for the #1 Zha Jiang mian noodles. Top ten best dishes of 2016 from Los Angeles Times Johnathan's Gold Food and Dining. The flavors are very rich and complimenting for the dish. Normally it comes Spicy but I had the option to choose how Spicy I wanted my dish. You can even opt out of the spices if you can't handle it. 

My cousin got the House beef noodles but they were very spicy. Our server was very sorry and concerned for him because he was continuously sweating over the spiciness. So very apologetic lol I'm surprised he finished it. His last words were, ""I ain't no bitch"" after he finished the soup.

We were given Mung bean soup which is a traditional beverage from China. It is made of natural mung beans, water, and sugar. We are suppose to drink the mung bean soup during our hot meals, for its cooking and refreshing qualities. It helps balance the Spicy dish so we can enjoy every last bite.

Their  nice settings of bowls  are large enough to fill you up, it's  originality speaks for it's cold but authentic  mung bean soup which, is unlimited in it's very cute white tin mug.  I enjoyed it's lightness in texture just like tea but the beans remain in the bottom unless you mix it to taste a little sweetness. I like their paper placemats with pictures and witty slogans as well.  This place is simple but has it's own character.  Fast service, friendly staff and the price is right.  Last but not the least,  it is immaculate clean.

Cons:  They did not have any single bottled  spice on any of the tables as Asian soup places do.  It would be ideally good to have just in case people want more heat or salt in their soups.  However, i never asked.  

Lesson:  Ask and you shall receive.  Maybe??

All in all, i really enjoyed my visit here.  Check it out if you are in the area.  It will not disappoint.",osKLt8Nm82mmi0-Sk5QDDQ,7,8,3,EEQjaOwN58M5O8CatVAsZw

I got the pork rib noodle while my husband got the house beef noodle soup. The beef was tender and flavorful, the broth was just okay.

Our friend got one of the dumpling meals which was really good. It was flavorful but not too strong. 
The only main complaint I have would be the appetizers. The appetizers were not good at all. We got the marinated pork and steam vegetables. The vegetables were dry and looked like it was microwaved. Good thing we got the steam vegetables for free by liking their yelp page. We each had a piece of the pork and couldn't even finish chewing it.

4039964,2018-01-10,1,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Mian joins one busy Spring Mountain plaza with some Szechuan dishes that will leave you sweating! 

I've been watching a lot of strictly dumpling on YouTube and tried this place out with my buddy. I've never had Szechuan peppercorns and it is truly a unique heat.

They specialize in numbingly spicy dishes that you eat with a cool tea for balance. The staff literally walk around refilling mugs for the patrons. On the menu they have hot or cold dishes, dumpling or noodle dishes, and meat or vegetarian dishes. They also have appetizers that are pretty unique: my favorite being their steamed egg served in a mug with spicy ground meat.

Each main dish comes a certain way but they have add ins like extra meats or a fried egg. I opted for their chef recommended beef noodle soup. I added short ribs and intestines. These add ins are a couple bucks and served in a separate bowl of broth that they're cooked in I'm assuming. I don't recommend dumping these into your main dish as it alters the flavor. 

The hot soup with the spicy peppercorns will get you sweating even if it's cold out. The tea they serve is unique and I do recommend getting a lot of refills. 

Overall I thought this place was okay. They have terrible service. I don't think they should do sit down style ordering because they don't come by to take your order. I had to go up to the register after being their for 15 minutes to order. I advised the couple next to me to do the same after I heard them getting impatient. We also had to go up to pay. They have a lot of potential with their location if the staff would just leave the register and take some orders and refill drinks.

The food itself was okay. They dish I got was good but nothing cravable. Also the meats I ordered were cooked well but served less than luke warm and not too flavorful. The heat from the peppercorn was definitely an experience but the overall flavor was a miss. If anything their egg appetizer and mushroom appetizer were things I'd get again. With so many other Szechuan restaurants in the area I'd not come back here anytime soon.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,1,3,dGf_zH4tVgOWHZNWOXYXbA

The amazing noodles swimming in the hot soup, bright red chili oil, and tender, rich pieces of beef, I just couldn't stop smiling. You know that cold water can't touch the heat of a chili oil. So, when you need to cool off the heat, take a sip from the cool mug of sweet mung bean soup. It's lovely in its own right on a hot Las Vegas day, but perfect at taking down the cumulative effect of a hot chili oil.

4351291,2018-03-28,2,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"This was my first time trying authentic Sichuan Noodles so I don't have much of a reference point but I know I liked what I had and so did everyone else in my party. 

In Vegas kind of late and getting hungry, started Yelping for a noodle house. Typical Ramen shops popped up but this one caught my eye primarily because the photos and description looked very authentic when compared to the You Tube videos by The Food Ranger Trevor James eating his way around China. I was a little skeptical not realizing that Las Vegas has an area that has become a booming Asia Town in terms of shops and eateries. 

We arrived at 8:45 pm and the place was empty but started filling up as we sat. Being unsure of much on the menu, we had a conversation with our server about what taste profiles we liked, what we were looking for and what some of her favorites were. She gave great advice along with a small free starter of pickled cabbage and some cold mung bean sweet soup that really was more of a refreshing beverage that cuts the heat more than anything. 

As the food arrived, I was amazed by the new flavor profiles, especially the mouth-numbing quality of the Sichuan peppercorns and I loved how you can specify the spice level of your dish. If you want it hotter, just let them know. I thought about a piquant intestine noodle dish but opted for the spare rib noodle dish which was fantastic. Sampled everyone else's too and nobody got a bad meal. 

The food was great and the setting/menu/taste is unique enough that it stimulates a lot of social conversation at the table unless, I suppose, you are dining with people that are experts on this regional cuisine. The food really was unique but I can easily see how it is a comfort food of Northern China. In the end, we spent about $40 for a party of 3 and had more food than we could possibly eat but it was a great experience and definitely a recommended non-ramen noodle place for the area.",WHe5tyJbVpkvO_3meMUrdg,6,4,4,kkonjuhVn3ToK74S_L8azw

Another friend in my group has a wheat allergy so he asked if it was possible to have his order with just broth and no noodles, but unfortunately, they could not accommodate him. Also, bring cash if coming in a group, they don't really split checks.

Despite this, I really enjoyed the food. I don't recall the name of the dish I ordered, but it was spicy and did not have broth.

Came in here during a biz trip. Was fed up with all the Vegas froufrou, fine wine and steak (not exactly complaining but i need something refreshing :).Looked up Chinese food around the Strip and found Mian. 

$10 Uber ride later, I was here. 

Mian, literally means ""rice noodle"" in Chinese. And that's all you would find on the menu, besides few appetizers. 

I was skeptical: coming from NYC, I was pretty confident we got the best Chinese food in the States (on average, this is still true). But the moment I saw that red, hot, big bowl of spicy sour noodle, in my face! My doubt gone out the window :) . It was just like what I remembered back in the street of Chengdu. Thin rice noodle, slightly toothsome, floating in ping ping hot sweet sour soup decorated with green onion, fried eggs, fried soybeans and pickled green beens. Hit the spot!

I was hungry so I also ordered woodears mushrooms, cold chili beef and a beef stew noodle to go. Def overkilled. But hey, we are in Vegas ;P . everything was delicious and traditional Sichuan cooking. The beef stew was seasoned in five spice and cooked prob hours before serving - was savory sweet and melt-in-your-mouth tender!

I also spotted other less know items  such as bone broth noodle, which aptly called ""milk soup noodle"" due to its silky, milky texture and color. 

Def will come back next time I am in Vegas and highly recommend!

I got their chengdu zhazheng mian that comes with a spicy sauce( definitely not too spicy) and it comes with veggies fried egg and ground pork. It's broth-less. I thought the dish was really good. At the end the peppers got a little gritty but this is a delicious hearty bowl of noodles. I would have liked more veggies but you can always order extra on the side.  They have non spicy options as well. Also they serve their meals with mung bean soup which is almost like a surgery tea. It seemed like dessert to me and paired really well with their spicy food. 

The must try dish here is their steamed egg. I missed it on the menu but my friend ordered it and it was so so good!  It comes in a cup and the egg is topped with a sweet soy sauce and ground beef.

5080283,2018-05-26,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Vegas never ceases to amaze. Wanting to get away from the unlimited food offerings, looked around for a noodle joint. In an unassuming strip joint (not the dirty kind), we walked into Mian Noodles. After asking for recommendations, we settled on the Zhajiang Mian and the special Chengdu cold noodles. We selected the radish appetizer and the marinated pork appetizer as well. Tip #1, check in, write a note get 1 of 4 free appetizer options. Tip #2 if you want the spare ribs with your noodles, don't get here when it opens. They cook it in the morning and takes about an hour to finish. 

Onto the food. The radish appetizer was surprising! Slightly sweet, texturally rubbery and a little spicy. Sure doesn't sound appetizing when written in words, but don't knock it til you try it! Especially if it's free :) Next up was the marinated pork. We thought it was like meat meat, but I believe it was more like pork jowl. For those who've had it, it's either a love or hate; there is no inbetween.

 The noodles themselves were super flavorful and chewy. The cold noodle was a sesame, peanut base slightly sweet and the zhajiang mien was savory with a soy sauce based sauce and minced pork and some baby bok Choy.

Five minutes later, piquant pig intestine noodles with gizzard.

""Awww come on!""  in total evaporation.

Just in time for the falling temperatures comes the sister restaurant of Chengdu Taste serving one thing; zhajiangmian-style noodles.  A spicy noodle soup with a complex beef broth set on fire with the addition of chilies and tongue numbing Sichuan peppercorns.  The spice of the food is not taste bud blowing but rather coats the whole mouth.  You feel the heat but you are still able to taste the goodness of the ingredients as you eat.  That said, you will still sweat.

The menu is simple and offers variants of the same noodle dish in either a standard spicy broth or a hot and sour broth.  Although there is a primary protein, diners can order extra ingredients including all proteins offered in different soups and free additional noodles.

Noodles are well cooked, still maintaining their chew.  They do absorb the soup rapidly so eat quickly.  The broth itself, very spicy but brings out the sweetness of the beef (beef noodle soup) and the richness of the intestine (piquant intestine noodles).  The mineral taste of the gizzard blends pleasantly with the soup the way a blood cake would work in other Asian noodle dishes.  The only issue, the braised beef could have been cooked longer.   Slightly tough but still flavorful.

The chili oil chaoshou (steamed dumplings) are good with the chili oil bringing out the sweetness of the pork dumpling.  

Finally, do follow their recommendation and drink the free, cooling mung bean ""soup"".  Slightly sweet, it kills the burn better than water.

Asian service.  You get your food and if you need anything, wave your arms in the air and flag someone down.

Inexpensive.   Less than $10/bowl.

Their business model is really cute and very well presented and there is no reason why the place shouldn't be slammed like Monta Ramen or Jinya.

The biggest problem is its service, I've read this is several yelp reviews.
Their staff is poorly trained.  It usually one 1 person per shift who truly cares, refills your mug, checks up on you and notices your hand up trying to hail for service.  The rest usually stand around like statues trying to do less work.  Today when I got the check, I put my card on the tray and left it at the corner of my table.  The fat guy passed us three times and did nothing,  the skinny guy finally noticed it.  LOL
I made eye contact every time just too see how much they care.  Then it came back without a pen from the fat guy.  It just goes to show thier training.  I don't get mad, I think its laughable.

I've been back to the place about 5 times now and I come because the prices are good and you get free extra noodle.  However I have to warn you, the food is not for everyone.  Pretty much everything here is spicy and mouth numbing.  Yes I said mouth numbing.  They put ingredients in their noodles that has a local anesthesia effect.   My mom is from Szechuan so I am used to it but not really either cuz they over do it.  

The food is good but its TOO spicy and too much of the numbing agent.  I can't really taste my food after the 5th bite.  I'm sure management will argue that flavor is subjective and spice level depends on the user.  I disagree.  Here in America we have real culinary schools and not just family hand down recipe kitchens, and they will tell you there is absolutely something called, too much heat, too much garlic, too much seasoning.

So compared to like spicy tuna rolls, spicy ramen bowls, some Kimchi, Or even a bag of hot cheetos.  This place is really spicy.  You might argue that it's authentic but that doesn't mean its not too spicy for Las Vegas and hence the business they get.

The free mung bean soup beverage to me.  I love it,  but I gotta say most people don't drink it.  It looks like a cup of muddy water, and it is but it's good for you.  What I find hilarious is that the mug says soup on it in Chinese and translation soup!.  LOL  I laugh because you have to be Chinese to understand that we have a lot things ""called soup"" that's actually just a beverage.  What I found hysterical was that one day while sitting at the big center shared table, a couple across from us who was actually from Cheng Du  took one look at the mung Bean soup and passed on it.  Then After I asked for a refill in of it in Chinese,  They overheard me and said,  OH! that's what this is? and started drinking it like normal Chinese folks.  ROFL

So Although I give it a bad rating,  I personally like this place, but it needs a ton of tweaks, because although the star rating is high, this business here is not that good for these reasons.

#1 Poor Service
#2 Too spicy
#3 TOO MUCH NUMBING AGENT!  no one eats that stuff except for Szechuan people.  but I'm positive they want to Americanize the business for more sales or why bother making all those English cartoons.
#4 I love the mung bean soup but its gotta go,  most people are grossed out by it.

So would I recommend this place?  Yes, but only if you're into the weird because the numbing agent helps you NOT taste your food. But that's what Szechuan is!  LOL!",udSgW1BGOjP4lw9_Fsqqpg,0,0,2,Yw9c9AgOm77ACvMoJl1wYA

5349149,2017-08-30,2,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"One of my friends told me about Mian Sichuan Noodles. It was brand spanking new and how could I resist trying out a new spot? A NOODLE spot at that! I love some good noodles!

Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my fiance and my best friend. We were lucky enough to find a spot the moment we got to the plaza and were seated right away. 

My fiance went with their spicy beef noodles. My best friend went with their hot and sour noodles. As for me, I went with their spicy pig intestine noodles. For every bowl of noodles, you have the option of adding extra items to it such as an egg, more meat, etc. Extra noodles are free of charge so if you're a big eater or you just want a giant serving, go ahead and get a serving of free noodles! All the extras that you get on the side literally comes on the side. They don't put it in your bowl of noodles. They serve it to you in an individual bowl unless you get a fried egg. If you get extra noodles, extra beef, side of something else .. you will have a total of four bowls. 

My bowl of noodles definitely had a good amount of kick. It was spicy but it's a different kind of spicy than most people are used to. They use the numbing spice. This type of spicy is quite famous in the Sichuan region. In Chinese, we refer it to ""mala"" which is pretty much translated to ""numbing spicy"" .. the herbs that they use will numb your tongue. It's a completely different feeling from having ghost pepper. So if you like this type of spicy then go for it. If you don't then don't get it because you won't like it. 

Other than the numbing spice, the bowl of noodles was definitely a burst of flavor. My bowl was actually a different base than my fiance's. His had less spice and more of a beefy flavor. I also enjoyed the pig intestines quite a bit. They were flavorful and fatty. 

They also give you a decent amount of noodles in your bowl. I actually didn't finish my bowl of noodles because I got so full. 

You also get a green bean/mung bean drink with your meal. It is slightly sweet and refreshing. The servers come around asking if you want a refill on that too, which is nice. You might have to tell them to speak English though. 

So why three stars? The location of this establishment is horrid. I hate the plaza that it's in. It gets really busy there due to Tea Station and Ichiza so finding parking can be a nightmare, especially during dinner time. Honestly, I don't think I would come again if I had to deal with that nightmare. I would probably only come in random odd hours where the parking won't be annoyingly stupid. 

The service, as someone else has mentioned, is quite lackluster. There will be times where they're constantly walking around and making sure you're okay but then there are times where none of them are there. Making eye contact is especially hard because it seems they're trying to avoid you. When you say ""excuse me"" you have to say it loud or they ignore you. I got ignored twice. Despite that, they are all very polite and nice. 

Overall, it is decent. It's just not the type of spicy flavors that I prefer. I don't like the numbing effect of the spice. I wouldn't mind trying it again though.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,3,3,byZVkzUOZLk9pS7nGWcF9g

The name of the game is Szechuan, spicy noodles.  They don't have many other dishes other than a few appetizers so get your mind focused on noodles!

The four of us all ordered different things. I liked my mom's the best - the intestine noodles.  The intestines were very tender and nicely seasoned.  

Brother ordered the hot and sour wontons which I felt were really good.  He thought the regular spicy wontons were better (less soupy).  

Hubby's minced pork noodles went so fast so I guessed he liked it?

Finally, my noodles.  I wasn't in the mood for spicy so I got their bone broth noodles.  This did not come with any meat so I added some beef.  I wasn't a huge fan of this.  The soup was ok...but not really great paired with noodles. The broth was already sort of on the light side.  Paired with noodles, it just washed out the whole dish. Also the side of beef was super hard and not nearly cooked down enough.  

For the sides, we really liked the cloud mushroom dish.  We ended up ordering two of them.

Service was nice.  They were very generous with their offer of green bean soup refills (nice and refreshing to go with the spicy foods).

The hot & sour noodle is a little less spicy than the spare ribs noodle but it has incredible combination of sour & spice and a nice contrast with the crunchy soy beans sprinkled on it. The spare ribs are tender and a nice combination with the noodle. We'll be back whenever we are in town!,wLbT6quhTb4ajj4e8CxwOQ,0,0,5,Zb1Ccw8FF8x4DsLAdG3zkw
5740321,2018-02-28,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"Solid 4 star noodle place with affordable prices and tasty dishes. The house beef noddle had fresh noodles with the right consistency--not too tough, not overly soft, etc. A medium spiced dish is spicy enough for most people. $10, plus a fried egg for a dollar more, is a good price point.

It's not the best such dish I've had but it is a good one and one I would eat again.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,1,4,xL-9h5pO1V6hqOD9V2OMNw

If you try it once will definitely come back we spend our lunch and dinner at this spot the atmosphere is Chinese theme 

Good service all around and they have free beverage (green bean) that will wash out the hotness and numbness


Remember egg custard yummy",PXHCZykdnYxUTArOX8ZLyA,0,0,4,bjnm8KobtCIq7oVn7NY8Dg

5819222,2018-04-26,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"First time trying chinese noodles like this. Really loved the mung bean drink that went along with the spicy soup. Me and my husband eat spicy often so we didn't find it spicy enough! No fear though, they will happily bring you a side dish of chili oil if you ask. I ordered the spicy sour noodle soup and my husband got the beef noodle soup. We definitely like the beef noodle the best. The broth was very rich and beefy and the noodles were nice and springy. Service was great considering there is just one guy working the whole front when we went. We will be back!",6adFRMbVtUS5jhL1S2GsXA,0,0,4,eeikO6O26-hrHgPunvfLWw

The meat taste very old and soggy, only ate 1/8 of it, couldn't finish the rest and gave up. So was my friend who only took a bite of her food and gave up too.  Waitress came by and ask how was our food, how come we are not eating? Told her the meat was old and it taste horrible. She replied ""oh"" and walked off.  Waste of money, wouldn't come back again. We went to another restaurant to eat after we left here.",WaIx56_FQVRV4mIRGstRrQ,0,0,1,nfksCKw4_Hhk99yRtyNEiQ
5928777,2017-11-12,1,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,I've been here several times and enjoyed my experience here. I ordered the intestine noodle mild spicy level. I like spicy food however I don't have a huge tolerance of it so mild was pretty good for me. The broth is very flavorful and I do like the tinggling/numbing feeling from the pepper. I also ordered the jelly appetizer thing but it is more of a dessert to me then an appetizer. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes.,iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,3,1,5,_YmmWdt5kX8597B5U-_Zdg

5961871,2017-12-13,0,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,"I love noodles. I can eat it everyday. In fact, as I am typing this review, I am making noodles for breakfast. Living in the Bay Area has its perks but good Chinese food is not one of them. I get excited about the food in Vegas and I couldn't wait to drag a few friends to Mian.

I had been to Mian in the SGV so I knew what to expect. The three of us ordered 4 items to share: Pork Dumplings, Spare Ribs Noodles, Cold Noodles, and Chengdu ZaJiang Noodles. All were great. The Spare Rib Noodle was the only soup noodle dish and that was probably the ""least great."" The others loved the Pork Dumplings but as a true noodle fan, I preferred the noodles. 

The spice creeps up on you. It's a good thing they provide mung bean drink to cut through the heat. We couldn't finish all of the food and the total was only $15 per person.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,1,1,5,824ywiQXVdmYgv4PfEjw-Q

5990863,2017-11-23,1,bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog,This is probably my most favorite for me and my GF to eat at. For starters you should probably start with the Chengdu Zajiang Noodles as they are spicy enough to get a taste of what the Chinese province of Sichuan have to offer and still enjoy your meal.,DUPRsj5lUBbMEf0ahP8SAg,1,1,5,iXcgkb3K0a9yyk7GFBpbVQ
