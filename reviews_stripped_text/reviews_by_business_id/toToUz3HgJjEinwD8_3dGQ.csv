This is the most affordable place to eat at the MGM, therefore the long, long lines in the AM for breakfast.  Prices are consistent with what they charge on the outside but they'll slap on an additional 50 cents for any sustitutions.  An egg mcmuffin is $2.90 and a sausage mcmuffin $1.41, add the egg = $2.90.  Probably the cheapest meal you'll be able to get at this hotel.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,5,4,3,bNsCHiC_ig8zIT8h7l-5Sw

The first one came out with no cheese on it even though it was ""double checked with accuracy"" haha but no biggie they easily corrected it and it was good. Also got a free cup of hot water and just made my own tea. The food was good (hard to get a flattering picture of fast food) but it definitely hit the spot!",e22g7lPfM0Z35peqpORGCQ,0,0,3,7OZ7UdTXIj5iWsGeWbci2Q
