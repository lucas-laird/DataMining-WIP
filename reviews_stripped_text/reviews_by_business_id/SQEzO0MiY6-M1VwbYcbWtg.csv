60051,2016-07-21,0,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,This place used to be great. Been a regular here for the past 3 years. It has gone down hill quickly over the past year. The bartenders used to cater the music to the average age of the patrons in the bar. Not any more. My husband and I are over 50 and don't care to listed to the rap / hip hop music that they always play. The nasty foul language in the music these young bartenders listen to is not enjoyed by us. Even when the average age of the patrons is well over 50 they don't change the music. The music isn't there to make their work day better. It is there for the customers. Sad to say but I doubt that we will be returning anymore.  We will miss the girls especially Sammie. She is the best part of The Lodge. The food and drinks are great and the place is always clean.,UXpdm1uCExUN6KjhB7f8iQ,0,0,1,udBSUDhRj-KrXTPKn5vSgw

427794,2013-07-26,2,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,"This place deserves a 2-star for the following reasons: RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL and MEDIOCRE drinks.  Most of the time we would've taken our money else where but hey, we drove all the way here, so we might as well just get our drinks and because the place itself might be worth it.  

The place:  There is a nice outdoor area that you can sit and a few tables and then a couch area with a TV and fire place.  However this place seemed confused of it's own identity.  Even though the title said coffee house and tavern, I would've assume that majority it will be a coffee house before anything.  From the layout and decor I definitely did not get a tavern but more of a lounge. The place looked clean and organized but there is the cigarette scent lingering so it's no longer a place you would want to relax and hangout.  There's also a few gambling machines.

The experience ---  I walked in with my friends thinking to grab a quick cup of coffee (since it said Coffee House) to just wind down the day. However, we walked into a pretty empty place with a few other patrons.  A staffer finally saw us but before I was even able to say anything the girl on staff straight up said we ""are not allowed in here"" with what I will assume her authorizing tone.  I was extremely taken aback by how I was greeted.  The waitress just kept on telling me how this place is 21 OVER ONLY.  So apparently she thought we were all underage.  Okay, fine that you think we look young, thank you. However, this is NOT how you are to approach a patron even if they ARE underage. She also added in a lot of hand jesters and body movement to be along with what she is rambling about.  Sorry, but I've got the indication she was also racial profiling us as if we did not understand the English language.  I have to wait until she was done with her rambling because I can't even cut in just to tell her that we are all over 21.  So after we clarified that we are of legal age she didn't even asked to see our ID.  What if I actually lied? Then she just allowed minors to gamble and order alcohol.

The food/drink experience --- Drinks are the fun part.  After we bypass the initial checkpoint we sat by the couch area but still confused if this is an ""order your food and sit down"" or table service, another thing I didn't get to ask when we were busy saying we are over 21.  The waitress came with the menu but  seemed a bit too zealous where I felt rushed to decide on my drink.  I do not know if she felt bad on how she was earlier or she want us in and out of that place but definitely did not help the mindset on this place.   After the waitress took our drink orders, two of us got up to check out what pastries they have.  (This part may just be a bit odd) After I ordered they told me that they only have 1 paper bag left to hold my pastries and asked if she can put both in one. It's fine with me since it's one order. However, my friend who was behind me order a pastry separately and actually got a paper bag when it supposedly have ran out a minute ago, wait, did she just lied to me???  She also moved very slow, I seriously have never seen someone taking so long to get a cookie and a muffin. I could've chopped down a tree and processed it to paper bags within that time. 

(This part is a peeve) I don't think I have ever been at a place that when we order drinks, let alone alcoholic drinks, they do not place a napkin acting as a coaster and then the drink. Isn't this basic 101 knowledge?  So I had to go and ask for napkins only to find our waitress, sitting down and smoking on the clock.  Is that even allowed?  If it is allowed in the state of NV then I apologize and at least it solved the smokey scent issue here.  Sometimes I forget that places aside from casinos also allowed smoking inside.

Anyway, I can only speak for 2 of this drinks since I didn't try the others.

Chai Martini with Soymilk - This drink is not on the menu, it was a recommendation. Apparently the chai martini now requires no mixing. Top layer is chai tea/alcohol and bottom layer is the soy milk.  you can distinctively see the separation.  It would be nice that I can mix it up myself but oh wait, nothing to stir with.  The chai taste is not bad but I definitely will not say it's the best chai martini I've ever had.  This one is good if you do not like alcohol but want to drink out of martini glass.

Tangerine smoothie - This should apologize to all smoothies.  It felt really refreshing when you are first drinking it but the aftertaste is the sugary burn similar to the ones you get when you drink a slurpy or icee.
 
Redeemable point (+1 star): The muffin and cookie I ordered was not that bad and one of my friend thought her drink was okay.  

Overall, I will never set foot in this place again since they don't seem to care about returning customers.   I hoped that this could've been a nice change from other coffee houses and potential lunch spot in the future. Oh well, on to another place.",2C-IiqBdp0eFtMZ3LKJIrg,6,0,2,KsWjvwRruw1Tsw0RL_YcmQ

I ordered a wrap and an iced white mocha from the counter and took a seat near a window -- plenty of natural light for this room, which was a plus.

All the sandwiches, salads and wraps are hand made after they're ordered and it makes a difference. My special wrap was a kind of augmented chef's salad that was crisp, fresh and tasty. And my iced white mocha was exceptional.

Great service with friendly folks behind the counter and serving.",S8nyk8xt0MHrdwilzCKjgA,0,0,4,EVpE5vxryXRlc-VCR8nMZQ

I used it as a coffee shop, but they had video poker. I've never been at a coffee shop with video poker.  I have been to bars with those, and this is also a bar. I wasn't using it as a bar, I was using it as a coffee shop.

As a coffee shop, it was good. The coffee was definitely passable.

The only real negative was the WiFi. If you are showing up to get serious work done you may be disappointed. Worst coffee shop WiFi I've experienced in a minute.

792282,2014-02-10,0,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,"First, I want to agree with James W.'s review (1/12/14). The place is unique and was friendly and welcoming initially when it opened. The coffee is pretty good and the options are nice. I'm sorry I don't know everyone's names but the best staff consisted of Rosa & Becky (of  whom only 1 exists). There is another girl (possibly a supervisor?) she is also helpful and nice like the two aforementioned. Now, I hate to name names but there is a young lady there that is pretty cold, rude and she will belittle you and make you feel like an idiot. I believe her name begins with an ""L"" (i.e. Lisa, Liz, Liza). Because I did not know that Elvis Presley's favorite food was a peanut butter & banana sandwich and that I didn't realize it was his birthday on the one morning I was visiting, she was quick to say something like ""everyone knows that"" in condescending tone. It's funny because if she's one of two persons working, she will be quick to walk in the back room generally when I come in. I don't know if it's because she doesn't want to provide service to me or if she does that to everyone. It is absolutely unprofessional! I used to visit regularly but much of it was because of the original staff who made it a fun visit and I do enjoy the coffee and hot tea. Besides the issue with the staff and the person I just mentioned, the prices have increased quite a bit and it cost me nearly $7 for a bagel with cream cheese and a tea with some soy and vanilla. If I wanted to pay Starbucks prices, I would just go to Starbucks! In fact and although I don't really care for Starbucks pastries, I think Starbucks has better pastries/cakes! I love the casual but modern ""woodsy"" ambiance which is unique in this city, but I cannot see really going here much anymore even though it is in my direct run between home and work. But so is McDonald's and I can get a breakfast sandwich and coffee for just around $5. Sometimes I wish things could go back to the way they were when they first opened aside from everyone taking a long time to prepare things and putting the tea bags in ashtrays - yes I did say ashtray's because that's what someone did because they had nothing to display them in! Luckily someone realized how disgusting that was! And they were not even brand new ashtrays because there were burn marks in some of them. There is a breakfast sandwich which I think one of the girls may have made up with possibly a sourdough bread, egg, cheese, spinach, tomato and a chipotle-mayo dressing perhaps? This was really good but I'm not sure they can still make it and if it is/was on the menu. I haven't been there in a few weeks now but it would have been breaking the bank if I was going everyday like I was going in the beginning when they were running a lot of morning specials which helped keep my spending down and felt I could treat myself. My hope is that management does read these and that they make some changes. If they do and I can tell they are positive changes, I may return more frequently. Til then, I probably won't be back much at all!",AyPR1D0je4VoCH1AqagpIg,1,0,3,6s6QP7FHqwazWaEzdRpuHw
842970,2014-05-01,1,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,"Not sure what is going on at this place, but it is a disaster.  Two work colleagues and I went in for lunch today.  There were two people at a table and two people at the bar.  Nobody else in there.  This should have tipped me off, but unfortunately it didn't.  It took them 5 minutes or so to take our orders at the counter.  For some reason, rather than running my card and handing me the receipt, the employee insisted on putting my card and both receipts in the booklet and then handing it to me for me to stand there and sign and hand it back to him. So weird.

Anyway, we waited for about 25 minutes before two of us got our food.  The third plate came out about 8 minutes later.  We all ordered the exact same thing: turkey wrap.

The turkey wrap was a disaster.  It was basically a low-quality tortilla with chopped lettuce, and chopped provolone in the middle.  There were 2 slices of low-quality deli turkey rolled up in the tortilla.  The one decent part was the sauce - it was a little spicy and made the food almost edible.  I am convinced that turkey was purchased from the Oscar Meyer part of the grocery store, along with the cheese.  

I have no idea why this place has any good reviews, unless they are strictly reviewing coffee or drinks (which none of us had).  Just terrible - do not waste your time or money.",_ELaMkFsytQSeWLUVJNkog,4,1,1,IoXCnXBj4dAFiaNmIK7Cvg

My friend and I was looking for something light on a hot day. All I can say is.. THIS PLACE IS PERFECT.  I have cheated myself by not coming here sooner. The atmosphere is great.

As much as we are willing to drive hours for a good meal, there's something to be said when you can find 4-5 places in the neighborhood worthy of frequenting.  To date, our search has been disappointing.  Not even sure the specific cuisine needed for our rotation but I guess it would be:

1.  Breakfast spot
2. Pizza place
3.  AYCE Sushi
4. Lunch/Bistro place ( weekends ) 
5. bar/grill

In that i'm free during the weekdays, I also focus on bakeries, sandwich places, Mexican/taco and Chinese.

This past weekend, she was hankering for a coffee ( a definite priority for her, but not a "" we"" place ) and I was wanting a beer.  Strangely, she also wanted to play a little video poker.  The combination made me think about the Lodge - we've been meaning to go even though it is a replacement to one of my old fav Italian places ( JR's - great meatballs !!! ) 

The lodge is a neat little place - for some it may be a combination of too many things - you have a video poker bar which is kinda hybrid Dotty's and the "" normal"" poker bar - some of the machines are individual, spread out, so kinda private, then several built into the bar for easier socializing.  They have a loungy sitting area with chairs, a couch and a TV.  I thought it a little strange they didn't have a TV over the bar area.

The gf orders some foo-foo coffee drink, I sit at the bar and order a firestone IPA.  We proceed to put $20 each into neighboring machines - in about 10 minutes, she hits 4-of-a-kind aces, twice !  She decides to also order a Panini - ham and cheese with garlic mayo;  comes with a side of potato chips.

Sammie was tasty, the beer tasty and the gf liked the coffee - we especially liked her walking away with $600 AND they comped everything so sorry, no idea about the prices.

Even with the win, not sure this will make the grade for our local bar/grill - it's a neat place but I prefer a place that has a decent selection of cold beer, a large number of TV's and above average bar food ( homemade potato chips is a major plus ) - we have a few more places to try in the neighborhood.

1555165,2013-09-15,0,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,"Bright in appearance and concept, this Lodge is unique among the Las Vegas chain's establishments, with its drive-up window and covered patio; inside the Lodge Coffee House and Tavern you will find an open floor-plan that includes creative log-based architecture, a fireplace, stand-alone gaming machines and the usual at-bar ones. The staff is few in number at any given time, but each member does a variety of jobs pretty efficiently, with a great deal of affability and enthusiasm. The bar includes hard liquor, in case you are from Washington State or elsewhere here in the west where ""tavern"" indicates beer & wine only. And what a swell selection of liquors we  found at this Lodge, where the Absolut rep just recently imparted to the bartenders a new bunch of recipes that incorporate the Swedish brand's flavor-enhanced vodkas. The place is very clean, and tastefully-decorated. My husband liked the grilled Caprese sandwich, a generously-stuffed ham-wrap and the chocolate croissant. I'm looking forward to going there with an appetite and trying some of the other offerings (this place' menu is totally different from other Lodges).  The drinks are fabulous, by the way--and here's a tip for smokers: you can order ciggies at this Lodge's drive-up window!",FhmErJANfSlct6DbmYnJWg,4,2,5,Eq2Jz3S4r9aicn1tF5Me8w

I haven't had a chance to try their food so this review is solely based on their beverages and atmosphere. There are gaming machines inside The Lodge but it's probably the most quiet, chill gaming location in town. Sometimes I forget the slot and video poker machines are even there.

They have a few drinks on tap and their coffee selection is pretty good as well. The inside feels like an authentic cabin of sorts, something you will find in the mountains somewhere.

3149829,2013-07-24,5,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,"The rave reviews posted with respect to this establishment are truly bewildering. 

Our rather lousy experience began immediately when we entered the place at around 5pm. There noticeably were only a couple of patrons.

""You're not allowed to be here,"" the greeter barked at us sternly.

""Oh, we're just here for coffee,"" my friend replied as she stopped dead in her tracks.

""Under 21 only,"" deadpanned the greeter.

We were bewildered as we pulled out our IDs for her inspection. The greeter should have simply asked for our IDs rather than assume we were all under 21. Besides, I know Asians look young, but really? I'm 34, and the last educated guess at my age was 27. Seriously speaking, I appreciate the compliment, but the way it was given was certainly not orthodox.

The four of us were then seated at living room style couches and sofas. As we did not receive menus, we had to flag down the hostess again for that reason. I ordered a tangerine smoothie while my friends ordered alcoholic mixed beverages. 

Another oddity occurred when we went up to the counter to order pastries after ordering our drinks with the server. The hostess at the counter took my friends order of two pastries and asked if they could be placed in the same bag since they were out of bags. My friend agreed.

But then I placed my order, saying that she could place it in a napkin if need be. She nodded her head. I received my order in a bag identical to the ones they were allegedly out of, along with a napkin and utensils all wrapped in plastic. Strange.

So we received our drinks. My friends' alcoholic beverages were average and nothing special, while my smoothie was not a smoothie. It was shaved italian ice colored orange and loaded with a large quantity of sugar. The aftertaste reeked (not even tasted, reeked) of sweetness from the sugar. If I wanted a Slurpee, I would have chosen to instruct the server to obtain my beverage from the 7-11 next door. 

At one point, we found that we could not find our server once again. Eventually, my friend located her... sitting in a customer's chair in front of a slot machine, smoking a cigarette. Ok, I understand a smoke break, but in front of the customers? 

On the way out, I noticed a machine that produced the different colored so-called ""smoothies."" It was similar to those used to make frozen ice desserts. I shook my head. We waved and yelled out our good nights but, not surprisingly, we were not acknowledged at all.

I would be open to trying this place again if the management responds actively to this review. Perhaps the off-peak staff is simply staff-in-training. 

Until then, I can get better smoothies at McDonald's for a fraction of the cost.

I went for a late night craigslist deal just before midnight and was so hyped over my killer  buy that i didn't want to go straight home. I don't eat fast food (if i can help it) and i simply felt for a coffee and not from a gas station. My trusty Yelp app to the rescue which took me to The Lodge Coffee House & Tavern. 

First thing i noticed was the flashing signage out front that revealed a deal i could not say no to. $2.99 ANY SIZE Pumpkin Spice Latte, YES please. This reminds me of when i was in Seattle and Tully's coffee did the same thing and i returned everyday of my vacation for the same promo deal and of course great coffee. Starbucks, CBTL, etc never offer anything of this sort and certainly not any size. Walking in was a trip but it wasnt as terrible as i expected. When i think tavern i think sad dull bar atmosphere with addicted video poker players, smoking cigarettes, not my cup of tea. But this place is not too shabby, decent decor, a little more lively, certainly a decent patio area to sit outside and the guy behind the counter was pretty upbeat and sociable. My Pumpkin Latte surprised me as it was not too sweet, the perfect drinking temp, and with the promo the perfect cost to end a night of deal hunting.

Soy chai - The chai was not overly sweet and all seemed well with this drink until I found that soy milk was chunky.  It wasn't rancid, rather it was the last bits of stuff in the soy carton. 

Breakfast Egg Muffin - I liked this because they use real eggs instead of liquid eggs. The first one I tried it had cheese in it, but the second time, it didn't.

Hmm if you don't like it that much then why do you work there? Then we noticed some cool coffee drinks on the chalkboard and he said he only does coffee. When people ask for something fancy, he gives them coffee because he doesn't care to learn how to make the fancy stuff. I asked about the food and he said it's just bar food and nothing good.

I myself have been waiting for this place to open for a while now. I work less than a mile away. So it is very very convenient. 

As I walked in I was hesitant because everyone looked so occupied doing a specific task that didn't really look like it needed to be done. I walked up to the register unsure of what I wanted, so I asked for suggestions. I love when and employee can suggest something that actually fits my needs. (because I am very picky)

They serve: wrap, salad, and Panini's 

I have never had a wrap because to me its just a burrito with a bunch of stuff that I don't like. 

I don't like salads at all.... (sad I know)

I have never tried a Panini so I was kind of excited that it was actually something that I would eat. I ordered the aged cheddar Panini with no mustard. It took approximately 10 minutes served with a pickle and some pepper chips. It was so freaking good I wanted another but, was full by the time I finished half. 

I also ordered a vanilla iced latte with lite ice. I have to say that this as well was pretty good. I don't know if I was charged extra for the syrup or not. Hence I didn't get a detailed receipt. 

Overall the décor is pretty modern, with like a mountain American type theme. I liked the trunk pieces above the bar, it looks pretty neat. 

There was no Wi-Fi when I went. 
There was some sort of discrepancy in the lighting. It randomly kept shutting of and on

3 stars for the food and coffee.

A pinch of Starbucks, a bit of Einstein's, a dash of Dotty's, sprinkle in some Lodge-ness - mix it all together and you get this neat place.

I was pretty impressed with the layout of the Lodge CH&T - the outdoor covered patio is very nice, the inside is roomy with a living room set up on one side with free-standing video poker units (like Dotty's), a full service liquor bar, and of course the coffee counter with a pastry case.

The menu has alcohol, coffee, coffee with alcohol, paninis, salads, and breakfast items (well 2 but whatever) and a drive thru. Dining in? You order at the counter and they bring it to you.

My husband ordered the Cafe Lodge Panini & a hazelnut latte. I had the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich with a white mocha (total 19 and change). The drinks were nothing spectacular -probably middle of the road average. The coffee prices are comparable to Starbucks (4.25 for a 16 oz white mocha). I was told the breakfast sandwich I ordered was new... it was okay - fast food-esque served on a plate. For 6.25, my husband considered his panini priced just right for the taste. Nothing we had was bad, it just wasn't great.

This would be a perfect place to meet friends in the morning for a latte on the patio or an adult beverage in the evening before a night out. It actually wouldn't be a bad place to hangout before or even after work. I was surprised there wasn't a TV behind the bar, it would be perfect to catch a game without the big crowd of a sports bar...
Note: they have ashtrays on every table and at the bar--- so it's smoker-friendly all over (this may bother some of you)

I'm definitely coming back to try out their adult coffee beverages....the chocolate martini sounded delicious.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,5,3,4,eVZScpP51oF0Govmt9xCCQ

When people don't know what something is they are less likely to give it a chance.  Very nice and modern decor! Gaming seems very good in here also.  The staff is friendly and accommodating but food seems to take a little too long especially for the simple menu they have.  Very nice outdoor seating but with soft mellow music it screams ""come in and do your homework"".  This bar has serious potential",NRERyz9L9jxnYVU6nLqlJA,0,0,3,NDztuinHNDxveeAG2cH64w

The chocolate brownie was di-vine, especially when served warm.  The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice.  Now I'm looking forward to trying the food and drinks here.",hBRBoalwEnKB30Frky4xXg,0,0,4,8uLBpU2ljoZFcLXu74HDaA

So after driving past it every day for the past few months, I can finally go in and try some coffee.  The interior is ""lodge""y with using pieces of wood trunks to decorate and some Jamison barrels scattered around.  This seems like a nice place for me to bring my laptop and work on the weekends.

I ordered a ice latte to go (minus 1 star for charing a dollar for vanilla syrup!), and it's really smooth.  I don't get that burnt taste I usually get at Starbucks.  I'm really glad I have a place to grab caffeine on my way to work.

There's also a full bar in case I wanted an extra kick with my coffee.  The question now is do we call the staff baristas or bartenders?  Baristenders?",54ANhcwkZm0zK-bEuEfnpw,1,1,4,SkIOGwtYIeN4j8S_viVmMA

Maaaaann!!!  you get the feeling of a coffee house and bar (without so much smoke)
great decor, staff was nice and pleasant. My latte with shot of Baileys was awesome!!!

The actual place is very roomy and welcoming. Great seats, nice outdoor area, excellent WiFi for the people that wanna sit, do some work on the laptop and sip on a nice latte. 

Overall, really great establishment. 5 stars.",SoJQibSoDN9hTPVasYkH7A,0,0,5,AoSA7ykXHSwTDtaXnUSWfw

I started studying here and its perfect- several tables & outlets. You can come here and you have the option of getting a beer or coffee or both! The bartender Dave is literally the nicest guy ever. I definitely coming here every time I need to study or if i just want to grab a drink.,o7sVRYWSskPEv9veCYes-g,0,0,5,9ijJ18qFTKBbMt__gwzZlQ
5793447,2015-06-29,2,SQEzO0MiY6-M1VwbYcbWtg,"I liked the idea of this place: Coffee, beer on tap, food all in one place. But my experience here was absolutely horrible. 

1. It's a damn smokers paradise! From the moment you walk inside, you feel like you'll get lung cancer. Had I known this place allowed smoking, I would have went elsewhere. 

2. Advertises certain brands of beer on tap, doesn't actually have that beer on tap. Offered it in a bottle (eh, ok...) paid for it, only to be told they don't actually have it and I need to choose another brand. What the hell?!?!

3. Shitty service! The girl behind the counter couldn't give a damn about customer service, besides the fact that she knew NOTHING about their selection of beers OR the wines the serve. Just another slummy, tattooed chick, bored out of her mind serving up drinks she knows nothing about. 

I think it's hilarious that there's a spot to add a tip on the receipt. Yeah, NO. 

I wouldn't bother with this place. So many other better places to get a drink or a coffee. Skip it!!!",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,2,1,1,Nf48v2Z_GRkUja_wGlJvCQ

It's not a bad spot to get a coffee especially if you can enjoy the patio without too many smokers ruining the experience. But if you're coming for a drink (to get anything other than a beer because they can't mess that up too much), go anywhere other than here. I was craving a White Russian and was foolish enough to order one here. You might as well skip the booze and drink a glass of half and half on the rocks, because that's all they'll serve you. On the other occasion, I ordered a vodka soda which was (you guessed it) just soda. A waste of money. I will never come back here.",lGRktJ1tyJ-wfekAu8Jt6g,2,0,1,VfYlF2NIKk-PorYaD1k_og

I also ordered a blueberry muffin, paid for it and there wasn't even a blueberry muffin in my bag. I just thought they ran out. No big deal. 
My second visit, the sandwich didn't come close to the first time. The bagel wasn't toasted and it was light on the egg and bacon. Again, I ordered a blueberry muffin thinking my order couldn't get messed up again. Sure enough I get home and there was no blueberry muffin in my bag.
