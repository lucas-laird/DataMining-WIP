The ability to socialize with a variety of people, listen to live music, play a variety of fun FREE games is all right in one location.

Good drink prices, plenty of space and no attitudes.

Our server, Angelina, was so incredibly friendly and patient with our questions, and make absolutely sure that all of our food was compliant with our various dietary restrictions.  She was attentive and funny, and you would be lucky to have her as your server.!  Also, the chef, Don, even came out of the kitchen to talk to us and make sure that the dish would come out exactly like we wanted it.   Awesome service by both of them!!  The food is really good as well, a great alternative to the myriad of greasy, fried, fatty, bloating options in the area.  Try the steak loin salad, it's delicious and won't make you feel like you need a nap after.  Prices are more than fair for what you get as well.

April and Morgan are some outstanding servers.  They handle the morning shift with aplomb and skill.  April is a tall redhead who is very gregarious.  She is the kind of redhead that would make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window, as Raymond Chandler would say.  Morgan is an elder stateswoman of the restaurant.  She handles and executes service promptly.  She excludes gracefulness covering all the tables.  Tony and the Downtown Project are lucky to have them.

From the casual chic decor to the oversized games there is something for everyone. Best of all - it's all ages until about 10pm and then at night there is great music both inside and outside with a live band out back where you'll find a year-round ""ice"" skating rink, giant beer pong and fire pits. 

We popped in three times this weekend:
Saturday 7pm - great vibe, not too crowded - mostly families hanging out. We had a drink a the bar while our teen boys played a game of pool. Bartender kept us entertained with the story behind Gold Spike's renovation.

Saturday 10:30pm - ID at the door (21+ only), lots more security, lots more people - crowd was mixed but probably early 30ish.

Sunday 1pm - popped in for another drink to watch some of the game. $7 for a Hoegaarden? Definitely fewer people but pretty chill. Still lots of security about - which is a good thing downtown.

There is a small free parking lot adjacent to GS off of LV Blvd & Ogden but if we didn't find a spot there would have just parked under the Neonopolis which is just across the street.

Everything else looked good on the menu and we will definitely go back to try a few of the 50 different sauces available for wings. I don't eat chicken so maybe they will add a popcorn shrimp or something for pescetarians like me. 

If you're looking for a place that makes you wish you had a basement - and that basement was a pimped out game room - this is the place to be!",uU5xH0JEqlhOxJ9srnbOVg,0,0,5,5NUDuCZbG3ravxJ6nLO81A

No real explanation was given . He says there are metro police in the back and I could talk to them to get the OK . I was more than willing to talk to them . I press him for the OK to talk with ""metro""he ignores my questions ,and eventually storms off in a little fit

I ordered food, because I was drunk and hungry, but wasn't that impressed so I would stick with the beer and games.

Outdoor: giant jenga, giant operation (this wasn't working when I dropped by), large cornhole, tetherball, four square, giant beer pong/trash pong, a stage, and seating.

I was here on a monday night. Gold Spike wasn't crowded but all the games were still occupied. I'm not sure how this place is on a busy night but I definitely recommend dropping by if you're in town looking for something to do with a group of friends, especially if it's a random weekday with not much going on!",3XBkZ019Gil7EOUxBn9Tng,0,0,4,qgx63WaPf6gpyNSqW9D9og

Even on crowded nights that I've been there, it's not suffocating and you can still get in on the games. (Oversized cornhole, oversized beer pong, darts, foosball, oversized jenga, oversized connect 4 - the list goes on!) I feel like the atmosphere is great - I have been with groups of 6-8 people and you meet other people when you're playing the games. It's a friendly environment between strangers!

Also, the cafe is a good spot for some grub. Pretty evenly priced, which surprised me. Angelina was our server the other evening and she was very attentive, and accommodating. I had been to Gold Spike for drinks and hangouts before but the food pleasantly surprised me.

Just be safe when walking to your car! Security at Gold Spike is pretty attentive to the surrounding area, but I am always extra cautious downtown.",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,1,0,5,Iv2IuxnkC0DrkJHO_j54Hw

The casino is closed and has been replaced with a very nice lounge, with a very nice bar, open seating and I was told they serve pretty good bar food by one of the bartenders. I was also told they still rent rooms. The outside has a really cool courtyard area, that has these really neat, over exaggeratedly, large games such as a chess board, with two feet tall pieces and bean bag toss games that are about three times what you would buy at a game store. The yard also features lounge areas with grass carpeting on the benches and little fire pits to relax, drink and just hand out and talk.

Very cool place!  The new management team adds yet another revitalizing kick to the downtown scene, and does so without a gaming device on the premises!

I had visited Gold Spike about 2 or 3 months ago, and chatted with friends about the potential.  Thinking more along the lines of a casino refresh, but I think this lends to an even better scene, attracting a fun crowd.

With the great little courtyard area in the back, highlighting a beautiful Air Stream camper setup, some artificial grass, blow up pools and lawn chairs, 2 corn hole games for entertainment (that's bean bag toss for those who just asked the question), 4x6 timber Jenga style blocks that entertain the players and all the spectators, and a live retro jazzy 3 peice band belting out some Sinatra stylings, how could you not have a good time?  Add cocktails and hors d'oeuvres for a perfect setup.

Inside, the whole casino floor has been converted to a plush modern lounge with a great bar, some high top tables, lounge sofas, oversized bean bags, pillows, a huge bed for relaxing with your friends, and lots to do.  Real darts in the back, with some foosball, pool tables, or a giant corn hole game to continue your legume tossing skills whilst getting an upper body workout.

I plan to head back on a Friday or Saturday night and see how the crowd is.  I imagine this falls right in line with the eclectic offerings of all the other fun downtown establishments.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,4,2,4,9653aQ2MsP9yqQte3T8iOw

It was fresh but diner style food. Recently I heard they are remodeling the grill area and have a new chef. Not sure. I think the grill has another listing so you can check out more info there.

It can get super duper busy outside if they have a show and now that the skating rink outside won't be back again, the space can pack a ton of people in. They usually have portable bars setup out back for those who need it.

There are bean bags, comfy beds, chairs to lounge in. A bar with attentive bartenders. Play pool, foursquare, jenga, giant beer pong, etc. It was a nice getaway from the chaos on the strip & Fremont street, for sure.

I don't recommend parking at their vicinity though. Just find a hotel, get it validated or simply pay half of what you'd pay for the Gold Spike parking, which is $10. Say wuuuuut. No thanks.

When we asked for management this security said he was the manager and proceeded to call in backup to escort our whole group out without allowing refunds. Living in Las Vegas we are a customer service based city. This had been the worst treatment I have ever received in my life. If someone is being civilized with you I don't understand why be so rude. Management please train your staff so they know how to properly treat costumers. Management and Security staff are the ones driving business away their treatment of paying patrons is absolutely awful.I really hope something is done to correct this otherwise they will continue to drive business away!,2TPUYeeaf7R39SiAo5Zi2g,0,0,1,zgeI9E0UQaP2rB-jqzzYxg

When I tried leaving a security guard which should have been my first sign that something was up with this place said I could not leave.  I said your crazy I am leaving and as I made my way through the door the security guard proceeded to push me back into the bar knocking people over.  He continued to push me into the dance floor area which was very crowded and we began knocking more people over and more security guards gave notice to this and they also joined in on pushing into a crowd.  After four or five security guards are pushing me into the crowd we were then knocking people over like a bowling ball to bowling pins until I fell backwards on top of dancers.  After this dog pile began to split up, I was then picked up by the guards and dragged out of the building like I had originally intended to do (WTF!!).  So they continued to drag me out to a police car, (SUPRISE!! Security guards and police waiting outside, this is obviously not a place me but more of a place for thugs, dealers and people who probably live in the less savory, lower income parts of town).  So now I'm on the hood of a police car wondering WTF is going on and the police were just doing their jobs by detaining me and figuring out what the details of the situation were.  Another older security showed up weighing about 100lbs soaking wet explaining something to the cops (I don't know what exactly) and when the officers (D.KANO and ESPERANZA) asked for my side of the story I told them when I tried leaving that I was told I could not (false imprisonment) and when I continued to try to leave I was then assaulted by four or five of the security guards.  The officers explained to me that they could not do anything about the assault or alleged false imprisonment because Gold Spike is a business.  When I asked that if I were to imprison and assault someone in my own home, the officer (D.KANO) had no answer nor would he do anything about the assault.  What I'm really mad at here is the security protocols that this establishment has and their bad protocols are only enhanced by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department.  Together they are a formula for disaster and I would not doubt this I am the first or last instance of this happening.

Gold Spike is that DTLV watering hole gem for me. They don't have any insane crazy cocktails... or any specialty cocktails, really. But they have that Cheers atmosphere with a huge twist.

Like others have mentioned, Gold Spike is an adult playground. Not so much with swing sets but life size Jenga, Pool, Beer Pong, Connect Four... etc. Some childhood favorites (and college favorites) in adult size! I always bring my out of town guests here to play and they always have a good time. 

The drink prices are reasonable... there is a mid-afternoon/early evening happy hour to be had. I cannot recall the exact times but after 3pm for sure. Even if you don't make happy hour, the drink prices will not break your bank. 

Gold Spike is a nice getaway from gaming in the downtown area... that's right; no slots or video poker. Try playing darts or shooting pool instead. If you don't feel like doing anything, there is plenty of seating and a HUGE bed for ample resting between bar hops.

The outdoor patio area is a great place to meet up w/ your friends and unwind. There's PLENTY of seating to go around. They also have mobile heaters for when it's colder out and sometimes they have a bar outside in the patio area too.

This price increase doesn't only affect the customer; it also affects the bartenders. I've spoken to a few of the bartenders and they have noticed a sizable drop in their take-home pay from tips. Not only that, but the Gold Spike management requires the bartenders' cash drawers be within a certain ""margin of error"", which means bartenders cannot round up or down on the added tax to drinks. This means the bartenders have to spend more time at the drawer counting out change, effectively causing less drinks served per hour which in turn results in even less tips.

That being said, despite their terrible policies and practices, the Gold Spike has amenities which make the experience enjoyable. Pool, darts, foosball, Golden Tee, and a gigantic backyard make the Gold Spike an iconic downtown hangout spot. Avoid the weekends though or you'll be with a very rough crowd, where fights are the norm.",TI7kbt0-pqu64u754rCMwg,3,2,1,7WKXEatmmnprQiJwju_JNw

Whenever I think about DTLV, Gold Spike is the first place that comes to mind. I've definitely spent a substantial amount of time here. And believe me, once you go, you'll be hooked. 

First off, there's no cover...ever! And I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get in. This place has the perfect ratio of fun, games, alcohol and shenanigans. It's pretty impossible to be bored here. Giant beer pong & chess, CORN HOLE my personal favorite, darts, billiards, shuffle boards, four square (popular with the boys). Lounge on the comfy bed near the entrance or the ginormous bean bags while you hang out with friends. Or take a step outside to catch a breath of fresh air and perhaps a game of oversized jenga. Be forewarned, I am a jenga master, lol! Play me at your own risk :P

Overall I just love the vibe here. You can show up in a pair of jeans tank top and sandals and fit right in. Drinks are reasonably priced and the food was pretty decent. Burgers, sandwiches, wings. Typical but tasty bar food. It's a great place to take out-of-towners or just a cool spot to #meetup with friends.

At first we thought that was weird but she explained that she was calling over a security guy to escort us to the elevator.  We asked if they had any problems and she said NO that they just don't want any either! We thought that was great considering what had just happened in Texas!

Large and wide spacing, full bar, and has lots of ""games"" that I'm sure are even more fun to play when you're drunk 

Gold Spike located right in the heart of DTLV off Las Vegas Blvd and Odgen (walking distance from the Ogden Condos.

Lots of couches and sitting areas, and inside of Gold Spike they also have a 24/hr cafe. Now I've been to Gold Spike during the day time (around 3pm) for a business meeting and have eaten there from the Cafe. I actually ordered from inside Gold Spike lounge area (not near the bar) and I had kids with me... I was surprised I was allowed to have the kids. And I ordered the Portobello Mushroom and caramelized onion sandwich and the girls I was babysitting had chocolate pancakes. The servers brought the food out to us in the lounge and we didn't have to eat inside the cafe which I thought was awesome service! 

My sandwich was delicious and full of flavor, drizzled with a dark truffle sauce that sealed the caramelized onion and mushroom taste together. And the fries already came with ranch on the side which was pretty awesome I didn't have to ask for sauce. and the fries we cooked just right, not too hard and not too soggy. The chocolate pancakes are also delicious and just the right amount of sweet. 

We received great service all the way from the people serving us food, to the lady cleaning the fire pits in the backyard, to the security guard in the front upon entering Gold Spike... I had a great time coming here at night with friends for a few drunks and an even better time coming here during the day for a business meeting and was able to bring kids and still enjoy the place.

As my friends hit the bar I began to make my way towards the rest room & came across a short, slim framed blonde woman. She too singled me out; as Damon B mentioned in his review; gave me no explanation as to why I was being kicked out. I did not make a big fuss at that moment because the DJ was playing awful music anyway, so I was fine with leaving. 

The only reason I am writing this review is because I thoroughly believe I was escorted out due to RACISM. The white anglo saxon woman was clearly on some sort of PREJUDICE power trip & wanted to humiliate & belittle me for my skin tone. I am appalled & disgusted by that particular employees actions, and with the Gold Spike for hiring someone like that in 2016. 

I will never be a patron of Gold Spike again & I will certainly inform everyone I know; including my large social media follower base; about the RACIAL PREJUDICE of the employees here.

1989316,2013-10-25,7,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"This place is a MESS. 

So, the concept is great; games everywhere, cool vibe, outdoor area, etc. Where it fails absolutely is that it turned into a very young 21-ish hipster dump with people screaming like girls, lots of drunken antics (guys throwing other guys over their shoulders, a little sickness on the side) and a staff that has no idea how to control this unwieldy beast.

Let me address first the bar situation. Sadly understaffed. Will, the unkempt bartender whose ass crack I saw more than I cared to, was rude, inefficient, dirty looking (I mean, scuzzy) and completely biased toward those he served. If they don't fire this guy then he's obviously in with the bosses. Loser.

A girl with a tramp stamp (you can't miss it, it takes up her whole back) behind the bar with her face in the computer for a good solid 20 minutes (that's how long it took us to get a drink and I STILL don't know what she looks like) ignoring everyone at the bar, that she works at, for a living, to do nothing. Perfect. 

Well, that's about it for bartenders on a loud, busy Thursday night. A bar back that we'd asked to help us get oblivious tramp stamp girl's attention snapped at us like we were filthy animals who'd wandered in for a scrap. Maybe a little customer service training is in order. I THINK SO.

On our way outside to the back through the blasting music that was so loud that if you could hear yourself think you would tell yourself to leave, saw a guy passed clean out. A sonic boom couldn't wake this guy. Because that's how loud the music was and he was snoring heavily. 

Finally make it out to see a bunch of seriously young looking kids screaming about Jenga. The fabulous band (with a bass player!) couldn't be heard over the juvenile squeals and blocks crashing of this game that seems fun, but not when you have cool music to listen to. Priorities are not right here. 

We had one great bartender who came over and got us our second drink. She was sweet and very cool. I tried to hand her a tip, but she had walked away (??). I had to call her back. Pretty sure she's not used to that with this entitled whiny crowd. Ugh. I'd die if I had her job. Or, I'd probably go to jail for back handing some of those kids. Where were their parents??

Anyway, avoid until this situation fixes itself, it has so much potential. As of now it's just a joke.

As an aside I'd say to the manangers: if you want to make money it's not by alienating people who have disposable income to spend and allowing the college level brats who make minimum wage to take over. I'm pretty sure they're costing you as much as you're making, both in keeping the older crowd away and with the serious destruction they looked like they were causing.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,15,6,1,BBBQtRlVSGzq0KJ3KlGPyQ

It's chock full of all kinds of over-sized games.  Inside, there's giant cornhole with what seems like 5 lb beanbags (the first time you throw, you will most certainly come up short, way short), shuffleboard, pool, hop scotch, darts and connect four.  There's also a huge bed and a bunch of giant beanbags for relaxing.

Outside is super chill.  It has sort of an upscale backyard feel to it.  They have a bunch of outdoor seating with live music and even more games which included Jenga, more cornhole and beer pong.  Loved it out there!

The only negative I could come up with is that this place is big, a little too big in my opinion.  Seeing other reviews, I can see why now since it used to be a casino.  I feel like the night I went it had a pretty good amount of people there but since there's just so much space to cover it almost felt kind of empty.

Get your staff in check. I've eaten at your diner many times since you've reopened. Never to be acknowledged in order to be seated- then wind up seating myself and my friends at the bar inside the diner after a solid amount of waiting time and attempting eye contact with a server. Then STILL get no menu. It's like everyone who works here is overwhelmed- and that's YOUR fault not your employees. Especially **** over at the bar. He's in a very bad mood and not really trying hard to hide it. 

You suck. I seriously hate the gold spike ever since you guys took over. Major Bummer. Heard you pay the bands well though. Too bad I don't even want to watch my friends play when you book them because it's such a college frat underemployed hipster nightmare!

There are so many fun things here- Life sized Connect Four, huge beanbag toss, shuffleboard on the inside. Lots of beanbag chairs and seating areas are pretty plentiful. There's no waitress service, but there is a big bar and a few mini-bars around. The main bar is pretty busy, but the bartenders move quickly, so there wasn't too much of a wait.

The best thing about this place is outside! I think that it is called ""The Backyard."" I really wish that it hadn't been so chilly, because I would have loved to explore it more. I saw life-sized Jenga, more beanbag throws, beer pong, playhouses, a skating rink and a guy singing with a guitar! They had space heaters around, but it just wasn't enough to combat the chill for me. There were lots of people out there, but I am a punk when it comes to the cold!

Only negative thing say is dam not enough yellow disks. Make sure Red or win early then later. Other games shuffleboard, bean bag toss, and big fifty shades of gray bed chill on. Dartboards, and couple nice pool tables. If bar game looking for sure Gold Spike had them all in regular or oversize fashion. If the place is packed you might have too wait but for the most part no one hogging the games. We played made sure let other people get their connect four on. If games get boring they have dj spinning music inside and outside you have live band playing (we were there for few hours so heard two different bands). The outside patio area is pretty cool. I like the set up with small outdoor lounge area in one corner then have couch and comfy chairs kick back hear the band outside. They have heaters outside too. Between the inside and outside.

There is so much to do at Gold Spike. Its not just a bar but an adult playground!
They have great life sized games such as janga, connect 4, and beer pong.
They have the classics like darts, and ski ball.

At Gold Spike I feel like I can be a kid again and let loose! There is always a great atmosphere and live music on the weekends in the backyard. 

For those who have not yet gone, it is an absolute treasure. I assure you it will be your new favorite destination. See you on the four square course!",SQOOovfWX7GGmDkHl-FzGQ,6,1,5,qlhMhQIUVqcQGnt_QXSVfA

The inside and the outside are both HUGE. They check your I.D. at the door and pat down people coming in for security reasons which I appreciate, it makes me feel at least 10% safer. The only con is that sometimes even when it is not busy all three bars take so long to serve you! The lines for alcohol are insane. 

They also have a dart board, a giant ""LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL"" sign, giant beer pong, four square, a giant jenga, and a lot of seating. At least there was a lot this last time I went, it was a Sunday night so it wasn't busy. I have never paid cover to get in here but some friends have said they do charge on certain nights.

NO COVER, always a plus. Free ways to entertain yourself. There's usually a band or DJ playing outside in the huge back area where it's just awesome. The giant game of Jenja, great game just beware of toppling pieces. The giant game of beer pong, to bad the cups aren't filled with alcohol. haha I'd probably earn myself a trip to the hospital after one game. Four square game. Giant game of chess. Darts, corn hole, shuffleboard. etc. There's a two bars, one an actual full bar on the inside and another one outside which is smaller. If it's busy at the inside bar their have servers walking around in the inside or maybe go to the outside bar. Drink prices aren't to bad, not cheap but not expensive. Haven't ate there. Lots a places to relax. Large bean bags. A bed right in the middle for when you find that nice girl and can't wait.

Cornhole, tetherball, giant beer pong, foosball, small table games, pool, Jenga, and carnival games are all games you can play. He foosball table is severely worn down and it is hard to play because the table is broken and the sticks with the players on it are not locked on to the table so will pop out when you're playing if you play aggressively. I was so bummed because I thought there was soccer pool but there isn't so don't expect that. 

Outside are where majority of the games are as well as a large stage that either a live band will play on or if you're brave enough can sing karaoke from along with the band (they also have an iPad to read lyrics off of).  There's bars    Located inside and out, leaving you with a short wait time at the bar.

I believe I have written a review on Gold Spike before and it was a good review. However the review I'm going to write right now is not a good one unfortunately... I was throwing a bachelor/ bachelorette party this last weekend and I had 10 people with me, I had plans of bringing everybody to Gold Spike for months. Telling everyone how awesome this bar was, the adult games, the atmosphere, the entertainment, everything was awesome there! well we get there and two of the people in our group of 10 we're wearing plain white t-shirts and because they were wearing white t-shirts we were not let in. They told us if they had writing on them it would be okay but a plain white T-shirt was not acceptable. I live in Las Vegas and I absolutely realize there is a dress code for most everywhere you go but a white f****** t-shirt are you kidding me!?! All of us looked very nice, we were probably were more dressed up than we should have been for Gold Spike to be quite honest with you... so because two people in our group of 10 were wearing plain white shirts they turned our business down. I personally was very upset because I come here all the time and I come with groups of people to this bar all the time, I also sign up for the contests they hold here. So the fact that I talked this place up and had plans of bringing 10 people here that were from out of state and didn't get in really pissed me off. It completely ruined our plans for the whole night. And that whole night was on me because I was the one who planned it. Gold Spike is more of a light, casual, fun bar, it's not a f****** club, so the fact that they are so strict on someone wearing a white T-shirt is really annoying...ESPECIALLY because it was a big group of people. And no where does it say that white t-shirts aren't allowed... nothing posted on the website and nothing posted outside the bar, so Gold Spike I recommend you put up your dress code up somewhere for people to see it for... that really wasn't fair and you're also about to get 10 s***** ass reviews now all over all over two plain white t-shirts...",S5uUNl5b58lTGD6oMRwQlg,0,0,1,CyeDqsmZVYYZw1p86B7Wow

My BF said got your ID ready and I'm thinking why they heck to they need that at the door. I imagine my eyes where wide open in shock as we stepped through the door. It's wide open with the bar and the little deli still in tacked but they have removed the slot machines and added random lounge spots with couches, bean bags, large comfy chairs and tall tables as well. They've added pool tables and over sized games, giant corn hole, yard jenga, giant beer pong, giant connect four and much more! Outside is an even awesomer, yea I went there, lounge area with more seats and a band and another bar. I'm sure I missed some of the other features but it was love at first sight. I love that it was big and there were a lot of people but you wouldn't know, unless you were waiting on drinks at the bar, because you were not bumping into people.

The second time was wayyyy more coherent. After a fab sushi dinner @ Yummy, we (Beet, Lindsey, Rod & brief Betty Draper appearance at TLR) stopped in. No more photo booth, oh well. Still a cool space and I'd trust Norm K on breakfast all day long. (It was after Ju's greatness @ TLR and only 1-ish) Lots more people outside enjoying the ""backyard"" vibe.

Maybe he stole my soul with his face scan, but nonetheless they scanned me and I went in.

From there things went on the up and up. You lose the lack of curb appeal and enter to find a big, open bar and seating area. The friendly fella slinging drinks poured me a mean Sprite and we headed outside. Indoors there was plenty of seating, but outside is where the party is at.

The place has a chunk of real estate and they're working it. The back is a grownup kid-at-heart's dream: four square, tetherball, massive cornhole, a stage for music, and probably a bunch of other things I'm forgetting. We jumped into the cornhole foray, and then played some four square with a bunch of tipsy kids. And by kids, I mean legal drinking age, but blowing off steam after work. They were fun, but had no clue how to play and as a champ of the 5th grade courts, I can tell you it should be all underhand, all day, two hand touch.

I reigned supreme at tetherball and felt it in my shoulder the next day, but I wrought destruction on my foes. I looked like an idiot, but when your pals are talking smack you wrap the top of the pole and walk away like a boss. Thanks, 6th grade.

At first I was a little ify about being kid friendly but that was quickly put down when the security at the door said ""come on in, just stay away from the bar area"".  Cool No problem even though It would have been refreshing having a cold adult beverage on a great weather day like today.  

We quickly wandered into the back patio area and were pleasantly surprised to see tons of entertainment to be had by all ages with the many games available.  They have a huge Jenga game, ping pong, foosball, four square, hop scotch, giant chess board, beer pong and everyone's favorite corn hole. The back space also had great music playing and the property also had a really cool Airstream trailer and ""Tiny House"" available for use as a meeting space.  Free WiFi is available for everyone which is great during the day because many people use the ""Gold Spike as an office or meeting of the minds for lots of ""Brain Thinking"" stuff. 

Inside the Gold Spike is a bar and also a place for food called ""Grill"".  Service was not the greatest because they had one women  running the entire restaurant with two cooks.  Mind you that it was mid afternoon and they had no diners inside, but we ordered at the counter and asked to have food delivered outside which was no problem.  After all it was an amazing weather day so we had to enjoy.  The kids really enjoyed playing the games and the adults didn't seem to mind if they were tearing about.  

The food came out within a reasonably quick time.  At a glance, I could tell that they were using good quality ingredients.  This was not you typical bar food.  We ordered the loaded Nachos which was made with colored corn tortilla chips and had tons of melted cheese, salsa, guacamole and Jalapeno's.  I was expecting loaded to include beef, sour cream and maybe some beans but either way they were good and a large portion to share.
  Next we had the fried Zucchini which came with a side of marinara for dipping.  Very good sized lightly breaded sticks fried to perfection and sprinkled with shredded, melted cheese.  Yummy!  

I had the Turkey Club on Sourdough bread and again this was a  very good sandwich with lots of turkey and crisp bacon and the bread was very delicious.  Another large portion with a mound of fries perfect for sharing.  

My friend had they Ruben which looked delicious on grilled marble rye and by the looks of his plate being nearly licked clean my assumption is that It ""WAS"" delicious.

Overall good experience at the Gold Spike today.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  Not gourmet by any means but everything had good fresh ingredients and the portions were filling.  The atmosphere was fun and playful, and I look forward to coming back to this place for some adult fun one night.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,0,0,4,ltQUWsjR_PyZ65rJvqQmAQ

2634658,2016-04-12,13,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"The revitalization of Downtown Las Vegas has included a few casualties along the way. The Western. The former City Hall building (now Zappos corporate office), and more recently, The old Gold Spike. The Gold Spike Hotel and Casino was a true dive, even by old school Downtown Las Vegas standards. Once the CEO of Zappos started aggressively buying up DTLV real estate, he turned his hipster vision into a reality and now a lot of the modern hipsteresque DTLV is the culmination of his vision and of course money. 

Now understand, this is not a direct criticism. I highly respect the man for investing so much in an area of Las Vegas that was truly the definition of dilapidated. Creating Container Park, making use of the former City Hall, and revamping many tired areas is all worth praise, but sometimes, things just go to far.

Case in point: The Gold Spike. At one time, a great low brow casino joint that you could get $1 beers and $.50 roulette. Now, the Gold Spike doesn't even offer gambling of any kind. The Gold Spike is now a non-gaming hotel that has turned their once classic dive casino into a hipster's wet dream of a bedroom. Beds everywhere, pool tables with fur covered handcuffs, a patio and courtyard with human Jenga, beer pong with trash cans, and 3 foot tall chess pieces. And of course, a repurposed Jetstream. 

This Gold Spike would make Jackie Gaughan turn over in his grave. 

It's a hipster hangout of every 19-20 year old Vegas kid with his older brother's ID. I've been there twice and that is two times more than I needed to go. 

I miss the old Gold Spike. The revitalization of DTLV is truly a wonderful thing, but even it can go to far. And it certainly has at the old Gold Spike.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,19,8,2,_oGIpD_yi-lhPUGuwQVt7w

I say that as an incredibly competitive person, because Gold Spike is filled with all sorts of games and activities AND has good music, AND has good drinks, AND is large enough to hold the crowds on Fri and Sat nights.

You WILL have a good time if you come here. Life-size chess. Darts. Giant beer pong. Foursquare. Hopscotch. Connect Four and other board games. DJ Booth with ample inside seating that you do NOT have to reserve. 

My only advice is that you be very specific when ordering cocktails, e.g. Old Fashioneds. My first one was delicious and I specified Makers, the second one was made by someone else with Jim Beam and was 60% bitters, 20% whisky, and 20% some mysterious brown concoction and then was muddled and crushed and shaken into oblivion.

When they weren't busy its taken 30 minutes to get a drink in their backyard and we had a group of 10.  if you go to the bar to get a drink some bartenders are awesome and others are too busy chatting up customers to help you.  Some bartenders will happily help you out with getting things for the game and others will say they don't know.  I've had to go inside to ask about ordering food. But once I did they were super helpful. 

Don't want to slam the place because it is fun and some of the staff does a great job. 

Also at night they copy/scan your license and photograph everyone going in. I like this. It probably makes things safer. But they pretend they aren't doing this.  They'll ask a patron to move a little to get them close to the camera but not tell them why and they don't ask before scanning. They don't ask and I have no idea what they do with everyone's data and how it is safeguarded.  It's a cool safety thing. Just not cool to not disclose it or explain how they safeguard the data.

From my experience, Goldspike is supposed to be an adult clubhouse (21+) where you will likely have to show your ID to prove it. On Weekends after 10PM they have a $10 cover charge for guys and everyone is asked to wear classy attire. When I went though, my dress code did not meet those standards and I was not given a hard time. Staff is pretty chill and the crowd can get pretty thick on Fridays and Saturdays. If that's not your thing, perhaps it would be better to come on a weeknight. 

The difference between coming on a weekday versus weekend is kind of crazy. Yes, this is Vegas, but it's not always a party here. The week days give you the chance to see how young adults have came and abused the luxuries of this establishment. The pool table's stained with beer with holes in the felt, the bathroom stalls don't close right, and the games you can rent are missing pieces.  I even saw a young man try to bounce a pool stick on a table. This place is the epitome of what you would expect to get when you give presents to ungrateful kids.

2732704,2014-12-09,1,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"Honestly so many things to say about this place and what it represents for the ""#dtlv community"" and for locals but what I'd like to make note of about this place is best put into bullet form: 

-It gets SUPER crowded on the weekends, so if you're looking for a ho-tastic/bro-tastic time, that's the best time to go. Look towards the backyard bars for easier access to booze at these times. 

-With that said, I like to go when it's not busy at all, usually early evenings or earlier on the weeknights. You get good amount of attention from the staff, no wait at all on the drinks and food, plugs and TVs all around if you wanna hang out and do some work, and good wifi. Not a bad deal. Also, the Bloody Mary's are delicious!

-Go easy on the bartenders, they're doing their best and they really are just like everyone else--not like the pretentious douchenozzles at other downtown watering holes that make you feel like you need a shower after ordering from them (coughCOMMONWEALTHcough).

-Food is decent. It used to be better when it was priced more reasonably, but for whatever reasons (be it DTP in ""financial jeopardy"" or capitalizing on the growing attention from locals and tourists or both--which is a whole other conversation) the prices have gone up twice in the last year and although the menu has changed, the food quality hasn't IMO. But when you're drinking/hungover and too lazy to find another place for food, the wings aren't bad, the burger isn't bad, and the breakfast isn't bad.  

-Going back to the pricing, I know a lot of people have been complaining--like myself who have been going to the Gold Spike since before DTP acquired it and make it their little clubhouse. Yes, the quality has improved. Yes, selection is better. But $4.25 for a PBR draft? Come on, guys. Figure out your beer politics better and either get $2 PBR tall boy cans and use the tap for another craft beer to expand your selection. There are so many creative ways to make money at the bar and still make your regulars happy, it's just a matter of figuring it out and asking how other places do it. I know this place is and will always likely be a work in progress, but let's be reasonable here. A little research goes a long way. 

P.S. My favorite bartenders are Virginia, Kaylee, Fred, Summer, Joe (but don't piss him off, trust me). And fine, Will is cool too. :P",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,1,0,4,oTT1vnUnmS8t4xmxahvgPA

I ordered Steak nachos. It was pretty good. It had a side of guacamole, mild salsa & sour cream. The nachos were made up of the usual contents (cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeños, etc). It's a pretty big portion for me so I couldn't finish it. Sometimes when I order the nachos some of the chips would come out burnt which is weird. 

Most of my friends got the chicken & waffles which is really popular here. I think they have one of the best waffles I ever had, but again I'm usually a couple cocktails in when I eat it.

outside, there's a life-size Jenga and life-size beer pong, as well as an ice-skating rink (no idea if it's a permanent fixture or just something for the wintertime). more patio furniture, firepits, and heatlamps. even a band that plays live music.

the crowd is great here. the drinks are delicious, and you don't have to fight through a mass of people just go get an order in. you can forget (and enjoy) that you're not at one of the night clubs which are filled to capacity with all the bachelor/bachelorette parties or the 21st birthday celebrants or the young and crazy college kids that don't know how to hold their alcohol. you don't have to get on some sort of guestlist where the guy-girl ratio has to be a certain way. you're not waiting in line for hours or paying an exorbitant cover charge. you're not restricted to a small portion of the club's total space because you want to dance to some grooves.

the Downtown Vegas revival looks bright with attractions like Gold Spike, the Container Park, Insert Coin(s), etc.

The amount of physical bullying/forcing that was exerted to deny a tiny girl entry was ridiculously shameful.

Whenever a friend of mine is visiting from out of town I take them here because there's plenty to do from the games such as the life-sized jenga & beer pong, cornhole and more. It's very common they throw events such as roller skate nights and pre-event parties before big festivals such as Life is Beautiful.

The drinks are moderately priced for Vegas standards. One mixed drink will run you about $8-12. They don't usually have deals which is meh but it's all reasonably priced nonetheless :) The bar food is the type you can expect from any bar-greasy, fatty and delicioso.

They never charged for cover the 10 times I've been there so that's a HUGE plus. Parking can be a bit annoying, good luck finding space on the tiny lot of theirs. You'll have better luck parking at the big structure across the street. 

The music choice is pretty good with a variety of pop, top 50, classics and some edm.

I had a burger which was OK, but the steak fries on the side were perfect. My last visit I re-ordered the French Toast and got two pancakes for $2 on the side. I was once again surprised with the size of them and how tasty they were. I asked our server what batter they used because I was blown away.

This was my first time to Gold Spike...I was pleased that there was not an entrance fee, just a place to have some drinks with friends and have some fun like you might have had as a child on the playground...or with a friend at a slumber party having a pillow fight. We never managed to utilize the bed for the pillow fight, but our group got down with some 4 square, and corn hole. The playground was larger than I thought it would be, with lots of offerings, including beer pong, humongous chess, twister, tether ball, etc.  When my love and I went down with some friends on a Friday night, there was a live band playing. We were in a large party of over a dozen people, but just like playground fashion would have it, we ended up playing with strangers and making new friends...a fun and easy way to wind down after a week of work.

Gold Spike is right in the heart of downtown, and we found a mix of lots of tourists and locals when we came. GS is perfect for a large group, but even a small party could have a great time. Don't take my word for it though, come play and get your drink on for yourself!

As soon as you walk in be prepared to show your ID! You little kitties that try to sneak in it's not happening lol. You MUST be 21 and up to enter! I think of this place as like an adult playground!

In addition to the great selections of games and good drinks, the music didn't disappoint one bit! The mini bar that they set up outside doesn't actually have everything like the full bar does inside so if you are a fan of Modelo you have to grab a few inside before heading outside to play.

It became me and my buddies' ""spot"" after one random visit there. It's like the owner of the old casino let his son redo the ground floor and the son was like ""let's make it a house party on steroids!"". 

Space - tons of places to sit, stand, drink and move around.

Drinks - cheaper than most Vegas establishments. 

Cafe - surprisingly good, tons of hot sauce options. 

Customer Service - 10/10

Fun - you can play giant board games, cornhole, ping pong, regular size board games, sit on a bed, dance, shoot pool, kiss girls, it's a blast. 

Location - a block north of Fremont: it's an easy walk from all the hotels downtown. 

Crowd - young and hipstery, all cool people mostly locals.

First, this place is located downtown Vegas, which means that parking may be a little challenging depending on the night but that there is also a lot of activity around it, particularly with Fremont Street so close.

I never paid a cover to get in, but you will be searched for security reasons. Gold Spike is much more of a ""locals"" hanging out spot than what you would typically find on the Strip and there is no specific dress code to get in. One of the best thing about this place are all the games you can play for free once inside.

Another good thing about this place is that they offer free drinks on certain nights, but expect to wait quite a long time for them even on nights when you do have to pay. Bar food was pretty good every time I ordered some.

If you're not feeling like taking your friends to a dive bar and having a night full of deep meaningful conversations, take 'em to Gold Spike. GS boasts a burger restaurant inside, jenga game which is as tall as myself, giant and regular sized connect four, pool tables, dart boards, shuffle boards, cornhole, giant sized beer pong, a synthetic ice rink, table shuffleboard, and a photo booth.

Along with all of these awesome bar games, GS has a decent beer list with several good brews on tap including one of my personal favs from Brooklyn Brewery. The beers are reasonably priced from a Freemont standpoint and even on a busy night the bartenders are on their game and serving them fast.

On my last visit I came with a friend who specifically wanted to partake in a cornhole tournament they were putting on that he read about in one of the local magazines. Upon calling GS to ask if the tournament was still on, he was met with the puzzled voice of one of the bartenders who had to go ask management about it. The bartender confirmed the tournament was on, so we jetted down there. $20 for a team of two gets you in and on their playoff bracket. There were eight teams competing that night and we admirably did our best and got knocked out of the first round. Afterwards we tried some of the other games around us and pretty much had a blast the entire evening. One drawback we unfortunately discovered  was the fact that there were only 5 cheap plastic darts in the bar which I suppose were supposed to be split between two dartboards, but we made do anyway.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,0,0,4,9Pgw95qYihy2WwZuCub8dg

The place is pretty big with various activities depending on your interests. Inside, there's a dance floor and giant couches/beds, pool tables, and other giant games. Outside, there's also a giant jenga set and tables to sit at.

The restrooms are pretty cool, too. There's tons of products at your disposal - lotion, hair spray, mouth wash, etc. - so you can touch up after dancing/skating/whatever activity.
 
People seem pretty fun, too. I can't wait to go back!

Update: I am taking off one star because they charge a $10 cover on Fridays and Saturdays, even if you only planned on going to Fiddlestix to eat. That doesn't really make sense to me. Ladies are free, but men need to pay, which is unfair if you're with your SO.

The place is somewhat of a complex, with a bar and cafeteria-style restaurant inside (which features an entire wall of hot sauces... like 100 varieties... random cool gimmick!)

3756207,2014-05-13,1,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"late night spot to have fun in the DT area. but the service detracted from the fun. 

pros:
- fun: pool tables, bean bag toss, etc. the mood was definitely very festive and fun
- roomy: plenty of space to spread out and lounge. lounge chairs and tables. i liked the furniture
- very mixed crowd
- plenty of parties - birthdays, bachelorettes, etc
- no cover! at least i don't remember there being cover

cons:
- almost put glass in my eye. no, seriously. i was waiting for a drink at the bar, and one of the bartenders was way too rough with the dirty glasses, a glass exploded and shards of glass flew out. a few pieces flew towards my friend and i, and one hit very very close to my eye. the further disappointment? the manager (it seemed like he was the manager) was right there when it happened. he asked me if i was okay, and that was it. he didn't really check further than that, and he made no offer to compensate OR APOLOGIZE. the bartender who actually broke the glass DID step up to the plate and did try to make us our drinks ASAP, but that was it. is this the type of service i should expect from any bar??? i don't care, i've been to some hole in the wall dive bars, but this was beyond ridiculous. 
- who do i need to bang to get a drink???? my friend and i must have waited for a bartender to notice us for nearly 30 mins at the bar. if glass hadn't flown towards my face, i think i would have had to wait another 20 mins for a bartender to even notice us. it was total chaos at the bar! if i wanted to wait this long for a drink, i would have just walked to the nearest liquor store, had a few swigs, and STILL been waiting for a  bartender to get us our drinks. 
- bathrooms were a mess. i'll admit it, drunk girls are slobs. this was pretty nasty. and with only a handful of stalls, OF COURSE, there was a line.

The prices are good in the restaurant and at the bar.  But service is slow and not very professional.  My drink was so strong that I could barely drink it.  But two rounds of drinks and beers rang in at. 37$ and our dinner was 19.98 for two so maybe that's the trade off. 

The atmosphere is pretty great,  indoor/outdoor games  both large size and regular size which you can check our for FREE just use your licence to hold the game.  

We played corn hole,  life size beer pong and Jenga love that there is finally a place to hang out and you don't have to gamble.  There is no gambling licence here.  All games are free. 

My biggest complaint besides service is that it's not maintained well at all,  I feel like this Palace in the next year is going to be a dive. It's very unfortunate as so much money went into the building and the potential is amazing but if someone doesn't come in a clean up its going to need a new remodel ASAP.  The women's bathrooms could already use it,  the out door patio heaters,  trim, booth seats in the restaurant and general cleanliness.  The downtown grand next. Door is a great. Example of a quality simple reno and they maintain the quality. 

We will go back,  we did have a great time with great. Company. We did like that we could just hang out and it wasn't a club.  The indoor and outdoor options are awesome.  Fire pits out side and a mini ""ice rink""  skating is, 10$ I would not bother.  The idea is great but synthetic ice does not make for a very smooth or graceful skate.

3966550,2013-08-27,1,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"I had an appointment this morning and decided to go somewhere for breakfast after.  A bit of searching on Yelp helped me decide to go with the Gold Spike Grill.  I've been reading about the changes here since it was purchased by the Downtown Project.  Wow, what a nice place!  What a nice surprise!!

The place is small so I didn't have to search to find the Grill.  It's a bright, almost all white area on the east side of the building.  I opted to sit at the counter.  As I walked through the lobby area, I noticed all the people with their laptops and I soon checked my iPhone for wifi.  Free, fast wifi!  Yes!

The menu isn't very large for breakfast but it's certainly adequate.  As I was looking at the menu, my server, Brittany, brought me coffee and a glass of ice water.  I ordered their 3 egg omelette with any three ingredients you choose from their list.  I got spinach, jalapeño, and cheese.  The omelette comes with hash browns and toast of your choice.  As I was enjoying the wifi and taking photos of the Grill, I noticed the hot sauces that were on the counter.  They have a whole bunch of kinds most of which I've never heard of before.  

When my omelette arrived, I chose to put some ""Scorned Woman"" hot sauce on part of it.  The bottle had a heat level of 8 on it.  I don't know who judges the heat of a hot sauce, but 8 was a bit too high.  But, it was hot and it was a good addition to the omelette.

Service was good and sitting at the counter, one of the cooks looked out after I was eating for awhile and asked how breakfast was.  When I gave him thumbs up, he had a big smile and went back to his work!  This was something I noted from everyone at the Gold Spike.  People had smiles, they were very pleasant, and they were welcoming!

When I left, I spent some time in the ""back yard"" which would be a great place to bring a drink or sit and spend some time chatting with friends.  There's also an area behind a fence where you can eat outdoors.

Parking is very convenient and free.  Enter from 4th Street between Ogden and Stewart as you head north on 4th.

While the breakfast was nothing exotic, it gets all 5 stars.  This is as good as breakfast gets and the staff is so very pleasant.  Throw in the wifi and you have a great spot!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,3,5,VptU-iSEayydcc-57XBZKA

We were here on the last night it was a casino, and were disgusted by the flock of Zapponians, all dressed exactly the same (like a cult), playing bad wedding music on the jukebox and having a grand old time celebrating the fact that their Dear Leader was about to put a bunch of people out of a job.

More recently, I literally spent a half-hour attempting to track down ANYONE who wanted to take my money for the Diet Coke I ordered. A person who values their time would've just walked out (It's 4 cents worth of syrup, for christ's sake), but they've got prominent security everywhere, presumably to keep the old regulars and other characters from the neighborhood out. We can't have any of those scum in Tony's New Downtown, can we?

For a place backed by a company with an outspoken devotion to ""Service,"" the service here is really atrocious.

Unfortunately, despite all of its flaws, and the fact that I'm basically supporting the Evil Empire destroying downtown by going there, I will probably be back when I get sick of working in my windowless office in The Ogden.

Chef argued with me. He claimed it was a fresh premade bag that was dated and he just opened. Spoiled tastes as spoiled will taste. Here is the end of the argument, I tasted it before he. He deemed it good before I did without a lick to his lips. Apparently his attitude is that labels on boxes and premade product stays good until opened without any check prior to serving it to guests. Then after this situation of telling me I was wrong he throws up a fresh avocado and says he will make the same batch fresh. Indeed fresh and a completely different product, but I could have done without the throwing it in my face attitude. The server pulled no strings nor did anything to placate the situation, basically we were soiled with sporadic and occasional service and a chef who could only read labels and was at best a by the numbers cook who was in dire need of supervision along w his front of the house cohorts.",5cxk_eDtMKHU7YOnZHzzsQ,1,1,1,_aRyLFoPPTQEgPREb7Oyow

4031365,2017-05-16,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"I have been here many times and I have had two negative visits that will keep me from ever wanting to return. The first one happened to my friend; they took her license and made her pay for ANOTHER persons tab and refused to give her her license back until she paid for it. That should have been enough to keep me out of here but this was the real clincher. 

On a Monday night I went out with a few friends to celebrate graduation and to hang out. In order to enter the bar they took a photo of me and scanned my license. I then went to the bar and ordered a drink and handed the bartender my credit card and told him to keep my tab open. At the end of the night I approached the bar to close out my tab and the bartender told me that he has given my card to Someone else and that he was sorry and I should just call and cancel my card. He also covered my tab but I don't feel that this fully makes up for what happened. This person he gave my card to then went and made purchases using my card causing me further headache. Normally I would agree that the bartender made a mistake. However, the fact that I had to have my photo taken when I had my ID Checked to enter the bar upsets me since the bartenders did not make any effort to make sure that the credit cards they were returning to people actually belonged to that person. They have such a focus on security for their front door but take minimal precautions to make sure that the correct person is signing for their credit card. 

If this happened to me on a Monday night then I wonder what may have happened on a busy Saturday when at least a hundred tabs are open at once.",BcFDYNoIqggFU6pMNM31MQ,3,0,1,x3IUFMK1eVBji07ClnkVRQ

These women were sober, and willing to engage in conversation about why they took such action. The security guard gave zero F*cks and said it was his decision to kick us out.

Ok, it would be a 5STAR rating but I have to take a STAR away for the BOUNCERS/DOORMAN and this 1 rude ass bartender.  These doorman/bouncers are HIT or MISS, regardless if you're downtown or on mega strip.  HOWEVER, when you are bouncer downtown (if you could see my face) I'm gonna need you to bring it down SEVERAL DAMN NOTCHES.  Look here, I totally get it, just b/c I am female does not automatically mean that I will be pulled to the front and the red carpet will be rolled out for me.

I mean c'mon man, I'm not saying things don't pop in an environment such as this BUT damn!  I really didn't understand why he had the latex gloves on, still over here wondering.  But that's their job, do a mental SMH show your id and walk in, don't let that ruin your evening b/c this is a fun place to be.  As for the bartender, maybe she was having a bad night, idc and irdfc, it's your job.  However your night is going, unfortunately you have to suck it up and PASTE on the fake smile for the customer.  She had major attitude, but once again, do a mental SMH and walk away, you will not ruin my night.

Back to the ULTIMATE RECESS, the inside is cool but walk outside and WHOA!  I felt like my 6yr nephew when we go to the park.  Eyes grew super big, I damn jumped up and down w/ giddiness b/c I was ready to play.  So we walked around, a variety of games, beer pong, cornhole, big ass Jenga, sidewalk chess, FOUR SQUARE and TETHERED BALL, say what, say huh?? I'm gonna say it again #FOURSQUARE and #TETHEREDBALL, yes I did jump in line to play some 4Square and had so much fun.  The ultimate shit talking and competition, and it was FIERCE that night.  As one player stated, ""we SAVAGES tonight, so you better come prepared""  I was not prepared, but I did make it to the the 3rd square twice.  I'm going back...it's so on.  Dj and dance floor outside, the DJ did his thing, he was cool.  

The inside games...G-A-L-A-G-A, yep and I still got my skills, even under the influence.  Aww this was my game back in the day.  Too little to reach the joystick, so I would stand on a chair and rack up my score.  Well 30+ yrs later, under the influence I still racked up the HIGH score.  Skee-ball, connect4 which sits on the wall, pool tables and a photo booth.  

There's a restaurant inside too, #FIDDLESTIX I have to go back and try them out.  All in all, I had a BLAST at Gold Spike this past weekend and will definitely be telling friends about this place too.  Umm, so who's down for any of the following:

The atmosphere is very carefree with a laid back vibe; not at all stuffy or pretentious. Picture a HUGE hangout spot you can enjoy with your friends. And when I say huge, I mean they literally have HUGE life size games open for anyone to play...for FREE!! From giant Jenga, to corn hole, to chess and gigantic beer pong, there's plenty of good wholesome fun catered especially towards adults. 

Friday and Saturday nights are usually pretty popin'. But no worries, they have 3 full bars (two indoors and one outside) to get your thirst quenched. You can come casual, or dressed up, just make sure you're down for a good time!",cglyQq_IWXEuAFKXYhNXgg,1,1,4,PXCB1yj1evduubjJbM_5fQ

I enjoy the little four square and giant pong along with corn hole set ups.  The music and live bands that do make appearances are a lovely addition.  The crowd for the most part is nice.  The vibe and ambiance prior to midnight is more of an active and friendly, music oriented, demographic with fun being the priority.  At midnight the DJs get lazy and leave shitty music playing and leave the station.  Plus the crowd gets more and more immature, rude, obnoxious and less friendly.  A total flip of just a few hours early.  My friends that came early, we have a great time.  The ones that appear around 11:30-12+ cannot find parking and just wanna leave and do something else.

I liked the two bar set up along with the overall lounging placements.  One in the back and the front.  I enjoy waitresses that walk around as well.  It's pretty spacious overall.  They got pool tables and shuffle board!  Lotta games to be honest.  Darts is my shit xD. I just love my time here.   But 12 is straight doodoo.

The good vibes and friendly play and interaction amongst locals and tourist alike disappears quickly once it gets later.  It's upsetting.  A 4star or 5star rating for 7-11pm and a 2-3star rating 11:30pm and on.  Check it out and see for yourself, it's a nice spot :)",NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,5,1,3,PVnHk9WdBZ-B2C5vuFQqvQ

Gold Spike is the locals spot. Those guys from High School you hoped to never see again? You will definitely run into them here. You may also run into your 50-something year old teacher from back then too, since a lot of older folks frequent here.  

Gold Spike is fun! Guys don't need to awkwardly stand around the bar or the bathroom to try to talk to girls. You don't even have to worry about having a drink in your hand at all times- I never know what to do with my hands if I don't have one! Play a game, invite some strangers over.

4382160,2016-11-14,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"What a great place to hang out on a weekend night! Coworkers had raved about Gold Spike, but it wasn't until I had my brother in town that I decided to visit. I was definitely impressed.

Gold Spike is a comprehensive hang out. There is drinking, games, and food. The location includes an indoor area as well as a large outdoor area. Inside there is a large bar, the food area, Connect Four, Foosball, darts, and pool tables. Outside was where most of the games were located. There were several cornhole boards, beer pong, giant beer pong, Four Square, Twister, tetherball, and giant Jengas. They definitely carry a variety of games to appeal to a variety of people. 

Obviously, this is a popular spot so getting use of the games can be challenging, especially the outdoor games. We were able to play a variety of games over the course of the night and without too much of a wait. The only complaint I would have is that several of the games were broken or missing pieces which contributed to wait times on the functional games. Twister had broken glass pieces on it, cornhole boards were missing bags, the giant beer pong was missing a ball, Four Square's ball was missing, and pieces of the foosball table were broken. Nothing is perfect, but it's hard to justify coming for games when so many are broken or missing pieces. I think this place would be a five if they would do a quality check on pieces and functionality of the games each night.

There were two bars, one inside and one outside. The bar inside had little to no wait and was quick. The outside bar was more popular, but the wait times were still reasonable. Drink prices were okay when factoring in that entertainment is provided.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,4,4,4,SCDjpBXxbTlxGUwaqz8UEw

To the left of the bar, there was a king sized bed, bean bags, and lots and lots of tables.  I really enjoyed the fact that there was enough space to hang out and not feel like a sardine.  They also have a cafe where you could grab some food and there is also shuffleboard, pool tables, and this glow in the dark room inside.

Outside it feels like I'm at a kickback in somebody's backyard.  It was very chill and relaxing.  There was a couple of couches in the corner and some tables scattered around.  You can play giant connect 4, giant jenga, beer pong, and that game where you toss  a beanbag into a hole.  The night I went there, they also had a live band playing, suh-weeet!  

Their drink prices are pretty awesome too.  I had sangria for $8 and my friend got snakebites (guinness and cider) for $6.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the wait to get the bartender's attention.  It wasn't very busy at the bar, but the bartender ignored me and the two other girls I was with (even though we were right in front of him)  and tended to these other guys who got there after us.  We waited to get his attention for 10 minutes and my friend said it's always like that...  So ladies, if you want a drink, you should probably take a man friend with you to get the bartender's attention.

I live in Santa Monica, currently known as Silicon Beach, and have worked in the actual Silicon Valley and in San Francisco, yet none of these places, which are teeming with tech employees and entrepreneurs who work remotely, has come around to the brilliant idea of opening a free, welcoming space for those who work remotely to use free wifi, outlets, and plenty of seating in exchange for the use of a full bar and full food menu, with some cool party games thrown in for good measure. Instead I'm constantly being guilted out of staying in a coffee shop too late or fighting with someone for the ONE outlet in a restaurant. 

Why don't more people realize that if you make people comfortable while they're working, they're going to want to stay and spend money? That's what Drew A and I did when we had a work sesh here on a weekday afternoon - we got beers, some nibbles, had a meeting, then closed things off with a rousing game of giant cornhole. While we were there a group was using the projector for a screening of an independent documentary. This is the kind of community centered business that I want to see more of! 

From what I hear it gets pretty lively at night... the fact that it stays open late at night is another brilliant aspect of this fun and casual all purpose space.

I want to first say that I have had many positive experiences at the Gold Spike in the past, but last Saturday night was not one of them.  My wife and a friend of ours head in to have a drink and play some darts. We noticed someone is already playing at one of the boards so we go to the bartender to ask for darts for us. She tells me that she has no more darts. I ask her if some got lost or if there were any more in the back possibly. She then tells me that I need to understand that darts get lost and there is nothing she can do about it and that I need to quit asking. At this point I'm completely shocked and say to her, ""I'm not just some drunk tourist I really don't appreciate your attitude."" Her exact words back to me were, ""You're about to become a drunk tourist and you can get out of here if you don't like it.""

Now, I can understand completely that Saturday nights are busy but to give someone attitude and tell them to leave simply because they were asking for darts?

She had other identification cards that are clearly her and the fact that the manager had the audacity to say ""nope not her"" yet he's on the phone and probably letting underage girls in.

The inside of this place has a square bar full of stools  on one side, with large beds and couches on the other. I can see beds and drinks leading to netflix and chill without the netflix. I don't trust them.

I know this doesn't sound great so far but here is the good part: They got a real WOW factor I never would have anticipated. They have an abundance of oversized games! They have dart boards half the size of your body, they have beer pong played with a soccer ball and industrial trash cans themed as cups, TETHERBALL, corn hole, chess, jenga, friggin 4 square?!! Get out of town. That is the coolest adult hang out for adult children I've ever seen.

I will say though... while most of the bar staff was friendly through the drinks we purchased, there was one crab I found there. I asked for a water cup to dilute the alcohol we paid pretty good money for, and he seemed genuinely upset at our responsibility as he flagged us off to a water dispenser and went on about his business with no eagerness to please since we weren't specifically buying drinks anymore.

With its great location (surrounded by parking and off the main path), awesome food (definitely try the nachos), and great premise, this is the place to be if you are in need of going back to your childhood, but mixing it with alcohol. 

Brought here by friends for my 28th birthday I was pleasantly surprised by how big the place was. We played the giant connect 4, giant jenga, and giant beer pong (noticing a theme?), and I even tried my hand at some darts (I sucked). Couldn't tell you how much food or drinks was since I didn't pay, but the waitress came to our table with refills whenever we began to run low.

The music was great, with the dj playing top 40 hits as well as some classics with a reggae twist.  The people here were super friendly and they had a live band that consisted of some guys from Canada who could sing/play their hearts out.

The bathrooms were very clean and the food was piping hot. I thought the addition of girls going around the room hula hooping was dope.

4701320,2014-01-19,9,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"Ruben has been wanting to check the improved Gold Spike out for a while, but I've been hesitant - what was there to see? Well, I was wrong! It turns out I've been to Gold Spike during a Superhero Pub Crawl a couple years ago. The only thing recognizable now was the bar! What used to be a casino is now comfortable Love Sacs, modern furniture and decor, a bed, and various games. It's quite the transformation.

After admiring the area, Ruben and I settled down for a few games of Tic Tac Toe with a large version set on one of the tables. As we continued to venture, we discovered shuffleboard (deck version), cornhole, billiards, life-size connect four, and more. We also played a game of connect four, which we really enjoyed!

Another neat feature is an art installation by Miguel Rodriguez. You peer through curtained slots while sitting at a ""bar"" and it's neon paint and objects against a black backdrop. You may also be able to go inside?

The best part of this newly renovated Gold Spike is definitely the ""Backyard"" as they've coined it. Complete with synthetic grass, patio furniture, fire pits, additional cornhole games, life-size jenga, life-size beer pong, bullet trailer, and ""Cold Spike,"" their ice skating rink. Admission is $10 and skate rentals are $5, but I read that this is an all-day price like The Cosmopolitan. The rink looked nice and it's large compared to the others in town, however, I heard that it's not really ice! Which makes sense why they haven't shut it down yet and have no plans on closing it for the season until they figure out their next move (the attendant shared that it's possibly being converted into a roller rink). The furniture was rather dirty, so I didn't take the chance of sitting down, but we really enjoyed a game of life-size jenga! Make sure you wear shoes or run quickly when it falls! 

Overall, really cool place to chill with friends and grab a couple drinks. The only mood killer was the smell!! It reeks of bad bathroom freshener that was trying really hard to mask (rather than eliminate) odors, but failed miserably. It was hard to stay inside for a long period of time and you could still smell it while in the Backyard as well, though not as bad.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,19,14,4,SlEu0BsyOdOIib7B_b1Qnw

It's 24 hours and they have all sorts of childhood games for adults! They had a giant bean bag toss, giant jenga, giant twister, GIANT BEER PONG, and giant connect four. Everything was huge. Oh my god, you have no idea how exciting it was. 

There's no cover fee for girls but there's a $10 cover fee for guys after I believe 10PM.

This place is great because the interior is beautifully decorated. The ambiance is very loungey and comfortable. They have these really great booths inside and a 24 hour kitchen. How great is that?? This beats all the bars and clubs that I've been to. I'd much rather come here than to a big, crowded club. 

I went to the restaurant to get some food because I was starving! They had a large menu with everything from soups to sandwiches to tacos. There's also a kids meal so I recognize that this place caters to adults and children. I got the fish tacos with fries. The tacos weren't great, but I wasn't there for the food. There was not a lot of fish in the taco itself. It was mostly breading. The fries were good though. The staff were all really nice at the restaurant. 

Everyone is very friendly and the environment is relaxed. Drinks range from about $7-12, but they have happy hour from 4PM-7PM and 4AM-7AM. I was there on a Friday night at around 2am-4am, and there was surprisingly a lot of people. I was so surprised that this place was packed at that hour. 

There's a parking lot across the street that charges $2-3 an hour, so parking is relatively reasonable. I will definitely be bringing friends back to this place in the future.

Unlike going out on the strip, getting dressed up and waiting in long lines, you don't have any of that here.  This place is north right off Fremont Street, and definitely worth your time if you're heading downtown. 

My girlfriends and I come here a few times and we never have to pay a cover fee, wait in a long line, or get dressed up. Score! There is a dress code, but it's much more laid back here. When you walk in, you'll see they have a dance floor, an eatery, bars, and games. When you head outside, there is usually a band playing covers of various songs. They're pretty good and dance-able.  They have your childhood games-foursquare, tether ball, giant Jenga; and other variety of games both indoor and out. 

I especially like coming to Gold Spike because I like to dance and the dj plays good music. You may be wondering what I consider ""good music."" I like to dance to old 90's hip hop & pop. Even throws in some Motown and 80's rock. I jam out to all that.  Sing all the songs. I'm the one who doesn't care what I look like, as long as I'm having a good time with my girls. Every now and then they throw in edm and that's when I go outside to cool off, unless it's summer, I just walk to the other side to chill out. Another reason I like coming here, you can sit down. Inside or outside there are places to sit without paying, or having someone come to you to tell you it will be $1500 for the seat. Drinks here are not as expensive either, which I appreciate.  

Staff here are pretty cool too. I've never had a bad experience with them, and they all have a good sense of humor.

Loved the backyard and especially the tiny house.  I would love to rent the tiny house sometime.  It is a little expensive.  If I could get 20% off, it would be a done deal.   Heading back in June.

Called around 4:30pm & spoke with a manager to ask about when to arrive before cover charge and attire, etc. Was told 10pm cover charge begins. Made our way to this spot at 9:40, the bouncer rudely stopped me from entering and said I needed to go around to the main entrance. I said ""but it's not 10? I thought there was no cover prior to 10?"" He looked at me and said ""if you wanna have an attitude you can leave."" I was so shocked by his abrupt rudeness. My husband grabbed my arm and wanted to leave. I really wanted my friends to see inside (I was here last summer in the day time) so I said ""well let's just go to the main door, surely they aren't charging yet just moving the line."" When we moved to the other door it wasn't even open yet. We stood there as a different bouncer came out and told us to go back to the side door. ...We were very confused. Yet another bouncer appeared and said to 'stay in this line and wait until 10.'' He also states cover charge WOULD be taken. Again it was muttered ""if you don't like it then leave."" We left. And won't return. The cover is only $10 which we would/could have paid, but the whole incident was so unprofessional I couldn't give my money to this establishment.

Security made him pay an extra $15 to go in, plus the $10 cover. They basically used their power to steal from him, making up fake excuses to pocket the money. I called management who doesn't seem to care or take his incident seriously.

5041520,2013-06-13,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the brand spanking new Gold Spike.  Brought to you by The Downtown Project team and Zappos.com.  Since the grand opening, I have been back every single weekend...oh, and to no other location downtown!  That says a lot for me as I get bored with a place.  Nope, not with the Gold Spike.  

Let's start off with the ambiance.  This place is a lounging paradise!  Comfortable, over sized lounge chairs everywhere.  They have a HUGE California King (or even bigger) in the middle of the joint, where you can sit down, have some drinks on, or lie on.  They also have high top tables and chairs if you prefer that as well. You can even bring your laptop and work.  They have free Wifi!!!!  And the greatest thing about the inside?  IT'S SMOKE FREE!!!!   

Go outside and they have another lounge area with comfortable couches.  Need more?  They have lounge patio and cushions chairs all around the outside area.  Then, there's the airstream.  It's definitely at conversation starter. Recently, they installed a large golden statue of a cobra snake.  That was kind of odd.  I think the quirky books, trinkets, decorations and bed set this place apart from other downtown lounges.  

The other thing that makes this place rock is the amount things you can do there.  Start with the jukebox and the photo booth by the bar.  Behind the photo booth, you have a couple of dart boards to enjoy with friends.  Then, there's the shuffleboard.  It's inside and super fun.  Next to it is the pool table and a HUGE corn hole game set up.  My favorite game!  You can always check out the board games they have behind the counter as well.  Go outside and there's another huge cornhole along with two normal sized corn hole games.  Lastly, they have the huge sized Jenga blocks.  That has to be the crowd favorite so far.  So much fun, but watch out!  Each block is heavy and will hurt your toes if it gets in the way.

What I appreciate is that within the Grill and the bar, they've kept a lot of the old Gold Spike employees.  I love the fact that they remember you if you frequent there.  Folks like Joe, Will, Jay and Heather behind the bar really makes this place feel like home.  OH, don't worry.  The drinks are really inexpensive as usual!

Trust me.  Such a great update to a downtown favorite.  Hands down, my favorite place at the moment.  I've fallen in love with this place all over again and I'm so happy this place exists downtown.  Come check them out!!!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,5,2,5,A-0FXlA7yrjtVSKnxmGnQg

I came during the evening to check it out. It was really busy, really loud and lots of dumb drunken antics. There's a DJ playing and you can play too : shuffleboards, darts, billiards, board games, cornhole, etc. The plus is there's lots of space and abundant seating and couch beds to lounge on. There's outdoor areas as well with chairs and lawn games. 

If you want something to eat, they have a diner in there. It's not much quiet since it opens up into the great room where everything is happening. 

I'm sure I've missed more than it has to offer since it's a big place and I didn't go exploring more once me and my friends found a table. 

I heard it's open during day and is a far different vibe. It's relaxed and quiet since it can attract the laptop set who need alternate place to work or study. I think that's more my speed.

 I don't know if it's always that crowded, but it was a little too crowded for my taste with some rowdy people. It was good people watching though. Where else can I find a hipster in a suit sitting there zoned out with one shoe off?",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,2,3,e7RFOVV_FNyQ22QtbZaMgg

Nope... nothing at all of that sort could be found here. In fact no type of gambling within the building at all. And no nasty smoke smell.  Line wasn't long to get in. It is a 18 and ove venue. 
When you step inside, there's a queen size bed almost directly in front of the entrance. It served as a spacer that separated the so called dance/game floor from the bar.  Located to the right when entering, the bar is square shaped and had 3 lighted  bar tables to the left of it that can seat up to 8 people each. Crowded little place, and the only thing keeping the under 21 guests was a ""21 and over only"" sign. Not too effective of a sign seeing as they did not card anyone ordering at the bar, and security was not checking. So yes, plenty of alcohol challenged teens running around. 

On the other side of the bed to the left when entering is the game/lounge/dance floor. Against the outer wall were about 6 table lounge chair combos, in the middle was a mixture of medium and large love sacs and a toss game (sorta like horseshoe but with beanbags); several table lounge chair combos for that party of 4.

Came here last night on a triple date with 2 of my close girlfriends, so we sat at the larger lounge tables. Ambience was good, Dj was the worse. Just a couple of kids practicing around on the tables. Eventually it get better, or we were just getting more and more buzzed. (Drunk)

There was 2 pool tables next to us, 3 dartboards at the bar, a connect four on the back wall, and more games outside. V aping is allowed inside which is a big yay. Waitress are pretty slow, and the bartenders aren't any better. Constantly waving your hand as if your a high school student with the correct answer to the word problem on the board. Took about 15 minutes to get a Jack Daniel Tennessee Honey and budlight. 

I do like the functionality of this venue. Ambience is good. Decor nice. Could use a new DJ. Customer service needs improving. It could be a one night thing for them, so we'll give them another chance to redeem themselves on that part. Overal, a good edition for hanging out in the fremont area. Needs more parking. I'm sure there is more but my memory hard drive was pretty much off the rest of the night. (WASTED)",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,10,9,3,LipwB16g_kQq5LzORmYkNw

The waitress even commented that the new chef has changed the whole menu and a lot of regulars has stopped coming due to their disappointment. I tried the ""chicken and Pancakes"" (which isn't even a thing) but whatever. The chicken was a small flattened breast piece with a panko batter and the three pancakes were small and bland. The advertised ""jack Daniels maple syrup"" was and off brand, peel-off lid syrup like you'd get  at a drive-thru fast food joint.

5210042,2014-09-19,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"This is a great place to hang out and come with a group. It was my first time here and I loved it. Here is my take on the place.

Exterior: From the street there is really nothing that makes Gold Spike stand out from other small hotels and businesses downtown. There is a small parking lot connected to the building which I'm sure is for hotel guests and staff. There is also a large parking lot across the street which is owned by them also but the parking is not free and can get pricey from what I have been told.

Interior: The interior is modern and upscale, I love the changes they have made to the place. When you walk in there is a security booth to your left, a giant lounge bed and seating area in front of you, and a bar to your right. The security guards are just your average big guys off the street and do not look on the professional side, they are more for show than anything as there use of force will be limited, I know this as I do security. The lounge area looks amazing and is a fun place to chill with friends and play some games or just relax, and the bar I will get to later. There were a couple more secluded sections for those who want more privacy which added a nice touch. The bathrooms were spotless which I'm sure will make the people with germ phobias happy.

Outdoor Area: The outside area was where the majority of the fun was. There was a live DJ when I was there and lets not forget about the giant games. Giant Jenga, giant beer pong as seen in my photo, giant shuffleboard, some giant game I think is called corn hole, either way it was badass! I will be returning for the games alone and did I mention it is free to play them?!?

Bar: The bar was decent with a good selection of alcohol to choose from. Service was a little slow as they were packed with drunk businessmen telling stories about random crap and they only had two bartenders on hand. The reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the drinks were not worth the price, they came in kids size plastic cups (smaller than your average red cups), and I got charged for some other groups beer also and the bartender got upset when I wanted their tab returned to my card.

5220803,2017-03-04,1,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"Gold Spike is a fun place to unwind and relax with friends. However, something that hasn't happened before but happens now is their dress code expectations and their charge for men at the door. It is ridiculous. I came here on a Friday night and they charged the guys in my group $20 at the front door and turned away a friend of mine because of his attire. He was wearing jeans with dress shoes and a regular shirt with a dressy business jacket. They said it was because he had a shirt on? But that wasn't an issue when my friends and I used to come in the past weekends. This place is on and off, they'll enforce rules but at the same time let some rules slide depending on your appearance at the moment. I just came in last week with a group of friends and a guy came in with a fake ID but still ended up getting in. There's three lines to stand in: guys, girls, and reserved. They have line separators to divide the three lines but there are so much people cutting and passing through the security with ease to get in. Securities let them! Idk if it's because they know them or are friends with them but that's unfair, you got a line of people waiting and depending on how a girl looks or if a guy could slide in money to the security you could get in Gold Spike without waiting. Now that they charge at the door their drinks are pricey (expected, of course!) but my guy friends would buy two cups of drinks that'll already be $14... so $14 for two drinks + $20 at the door for men = $34 total, only one hour into arriving at Gold Spike. Totally not worth it. Also, parking is non-existent, you must be willing to walk far away to get free/ affordable parking or you must pay a lot to find a parking up close. Upon entering Gold Spike go straight to hanging out outside, their games are fun and the environment out there is better than the inside.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,2,2,2,vaMVTDcpz7F4Sr8nj9l7HQ
5224105,2014-08-12,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"I had high hopes for the ""new"" Gold Spike.  Last time out, it was a run-down casino with little excitement inside.  Now, it's a nicely renovated gaming establishment.  By ""gaming"", I mean the bag toss games, giant chess & Jenga, etc.  No casino games that we could find.  That was a bit puzzling, but we accepted that soon after arriving.

The place wasn't crowded by any means, but all the games were occupied.  That created a very strange atmosphere.  What do you do there when all the games are taken up?  Belly up to strangers and declare ""I got next!""?  Meh.  Sit at a table with a beer while you talk a game waiting for folks to leave?  Hmph.

This place has a lot of promise.  The concept is solid, but the execution needs to be worked on.  There's a lot of open space for people to mull around, but there's nothing to DO for those folks.  There could easily be some blackjack tables in areas, or some slot banks.  Clearly, gambling isn't a priority here.  And that's fine, but it feels strange.  More games (bags, shuffleboard, etc.) could get more people to stick around longer.  We hung around for one beer, a game of bags, then blew out of there.

The crowd tended to be more of the younger, ""hipster"" crowd.  Perhaps if that's your thing, you'd rate this higher.  I yearned for more availability, more fun, more action, and some excitement.  The band that was playing was pretty decent.",4zTUqzgK7MMycdrhNDKIBQ,1,0,3,ttgc5Fbsf74FtZ4yXMW8rw

First off, the bar:
Meh.  Service was slow.  My fella and I stood there for 10 minutes while the (all males) bartenders took care of all the pretty girls (even ones who got to the bar after us) before looking around the bar blankly.  We had to say something to get his attention. 

Drinks are expensive.  We paid $15 for two WELL Whiskey and cokes.  $7.50 a piece for a single?  Yikes.  Too rich for my blood.  I'm reminded why I don't come downtown often.

They have pool tables, and a ton of games available, which is really cool.  I enjoyed seeing everyone playing and having fun.  

The reason for the third star was the food.  If the food hadn't been as good, my star rating would have been a solid two.  

Service was slow, and pretty impersonal.  
The French Dip was bland, and the hummus plate was a little small for $8. 
The chicken tenders, however, were amazing.  Really...they were crunchy, and juicy, and NOT GREASY.  That's the biggest thing for me, I can't stand a greasy chicken tender.
The chicken tenders and fries (which were great too) deserve a whole star on their own, and saved this from being a 2 star rating.

Will I come back?  Probably not, unless I'm already downtown...but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it, either.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,9,5,3,C21ZQSW6wdN-30LlSzipUA

From your typical bar staples like pool tables and dart boards, to more youthful games like life size Jenga and Connect 4, there's plenty of activities to choose from. I even spied a counter service check out where board games like Scrabble could be rented out! If you venture outside, there's more fun filled adventures waiting for you (like Hopscotch and Giant Beer Pong). There's usually a band playing outside, too.

What I really like about Gold Spike is that there's ample seating available. I'm tired of going into bars/clubs where seating is extremely limited. At Gold Spike, I'm almost guaranteed some sit-down time. I'm also a fan of the wide variety of social activities available to guests. It's pretty hard to get bored here! 

4/5 for the Gold Spike venue/nightlife 

Worth a Return Visit?
Gold Spike is immensely popular with young crowds and especially locals. The vibe here reminds me of bars in Denver. Gold Spike is one of my favorite hangout spots in DTLV.

Between lounging, partying, & watching people play games, this is every fun adult playground!! We were fortunate to come here with the play area all to ourselves on a Sunday morning. I'm curious to see how this place is at night, which I'm sure gets packed!

* Service:
They have security guards keeping a look out in case you're doing something ""crazy"". Whoops, they had the ""Life is Beautiful"" stand from the past music festival outside & I climbed it for the heck of a photo & was told to get down. The security guard we met though was super nice! He gave us a brief info on the spots that happen to be poppin at night. The service we received inside by the girl at the bar was super chill & served our drinks the way we wanted it.

* Outdoor playground:
- Airstream
- Tiny house 
- life size beerpong 
- dodgeball
- jumbo jenga
- beerpong tables 
- twister
- sandbags
- life size chess

All are fun while getting a snack or drink from the bar inside! We were having fun playing with it all because no one else was out with us. 

* Inside:
- Cafe
- Full bar
- bed & movie-like seats in front of a big screen tv
- board games
- games

Once I got up the line to the bouncer they scanned my ID and took a picture of my face. They told me I could not enter because my ID apparently did not look like me. I asked how it didn't look like me.. and he rudely said the girl in the ID picture has a slimmer face then yours and has a different hair color. I felt very insulted. Yes my I'd picture was taken 4 years ago when I was 19 and I have recently changed my hair color. But just because I have gained weight in the last years and had make up on tonight with a different hair color apparently that's reason to believe that my ID is not mine. Even tho it scanned and they knew it was a valid ID and it had worked just fine the week before when I had last gone in there. I'm not upset about not being able to go. I left and went to a different bar and enjoyed my Saturday night off. I'm just upset about the reasoning behind it and the way the bouncer handled it and the comments that where made about my appearance.

On Monday night, friends requested that I join them down there and I am extremely grateful I did. The entire space has been cleaned out and modernly decorated. I entered a giant man cave. This is a large, open space with large games everywhere, a back patio, a bar, and a cafe. It's all non-smoking (which I learned the hard way by lighting up at the bar, but the staff was completely cool about it). 

There are several large versions of Connect 4, Shuffleboard, and Bean Bag Toss. There are several pool tables and a large Jenga game outside. There is plenty of lounge seating inside and on the back patio. There is also a little booth were you can borrow board games like Clue, Monopoly, etc.  There are large beds with plush pillows and giant bean bag chairs. The tables have large books full of art and history.  It's a beautiful and open space. The best part, all of these games are 100% free. This place delivers so much fun and happiness. What a wonderful concept! Brought to Las Vegas from Zappos.com and the Downtown Project.

The drinks are inexpensive and they offer gluten free and organic bottled beers. The bar area is the only place in which underage patrons aren't permitted. Such a great place for those teetering between the 20-21 years of age. Best of both worlds.

I'm not much for drinking (in public) since I wore out my ""inebriated welcome"" in college. So with much partying out of my system I don't look forward to loud music, large crowds and wild daubachary. When I got there, the place reminded me of a much subtle DAVE & BUSTERS. Who plays school-yard games while drunk?! 
Rarely giving into peer pressure I decided to sip on something to get my friends off my back. One straight coca-cola turned into rum & coke, a few fireball whisky shots, 7 & 7's, and various other drinks from slick male friends saying ""Hey, Oona. Try this!"", and I was feeling pretty good....

Buzzed and winning at a game that involved sand bags, holes and much focused concentration I ran into a stranger with a jar of maraschino cherries. After making the stupid cherry joke from the movie Grease, I let her put one in my mouth. WTF?! Why would would I take candy from a stranger? Not only that, who know's where her hands have been?! Within a few minutes I felt really wierd. ---Like I had 3 back to back shots! Was I being roofied? I told my friends I didn't feel well...well, I wasn't feeling bad either. 

Feeling like I was about to black out and be date raped later on that evening, I had to at least know what to tell the police the next morning, so I asked nonchalantly, ""So, uhh...what was in those cherries?"" 
Her boyfriend admitted that they were soaked in MOONSHINE! WTF?! I didn't care that I could possibly black out and be violated, I just cared that it's not regulated by the health department! Holy crap! Isn't that stuff made in people's bath tub?! 
Next thing I know, she dumps the cherries on the ground and walks away! Why would she do that?! Is she destroying evidence? 

I got super paranoid and all of my friends begin to stand around me and ask me if I was ok, and then taunted me about how I wasn't going to be able to pass my annual drug test at work. I took a picture of the cherries as evidence just in case my urine came up dirty so I could point to the picture and say, ""I SWEAR! I DON'T DO DRUGS--LOOK!"" 
After about an hour I started to feel a little better and stopped taking shots. What time is it? One thing about Gold Spike is there is no concept of time. I'm a person that's in bed by 8pm so I'm used to going places where the later it gets, the less people you see! Here--it was the opposite. It was 3am and the place was PACKED. After random guys started circling my seat, looking like they were going to ask me for the ""digits"" I decided it was time to go. It was now approaching 4am! Where did the time go?! I could have continued this adventure by going with my coworkers to get breakfast, but all I kept thinking was the last thing I wanted to Yelp about next was how I barfed my scrambled eggs.

Overall I haven't had THIS MUCH fun in a really long time. I laughed hard, played hard like I was at recess in grade school, and drank hard like I was back in college. 
I will definitely come back to Gold Spike again. It was a good time.

Now, I understand people getting kicked out for causing a ruckus and being extremely belligerent (they SHOULD get kicked out).  But both consecutive times, security kicked out my friends for very ODD reasons.

The first time was back in January 2016. We were sitting down chilling with our drinks. One of my friends was sitting down with us, but he was just to the side, not really interacting because he's a pretty reserved guy. Security came up to him telling him ""You need to leave"" without any explanation. What??? Kicking him out because he's not doing anything? OK............... [Insert Waka Flocka meme here]. 

The second time was recent (5/18/2018). One of my friends was told by security to leave because ""she looked lost and was wandering around."" UMMM WHAT??? It seems like Gold Spike is yearning for people to be surrounded and interactive with other people, and for what? You can't let someone just go to the bathroom by themselves????? LOL [Insert blinking white guy gif here].

If you want to come here, you need to babysit your friends. Don't let them look lonely, and don't let them wander around. Don't let them go to the bathroom by themselves. They're not only concerned about belligerent people; they apparently see people who can't find the bathroom by themselves a threat as well.

If this establishment wants to kick out people for certain behavior, they should post the standards of conduct in a public area. I'm trying to look for it on their website, and I see nothing. If you look at all their low-rated reviews, most of them are about situations with security. 

Besides that, overpriced drinks & food, weird music until midnight, and just strange vibes all around. I am never coming here and spending money here again.

I told her that we've been there for hours and have probably bought 8 rounds of drinks without the servers ever mentioning to us that we were in a VIP area. Her excuse was the waitresses were ""NEW""and didn't know. I'm sorry but that is not our problem when you can not train your staff properly, you don't have any reserve signs, nor is the area sectioned off with a velvet rope or security, and on one of your busiest nights of the year your staff does not know where the VIP section is. 
GiGi thank you for ruining our night. If we had known before we had already bought all those drinks through your waitresses and at the bar this review might have been more  pleasant. We went there to get away from the lines and bottle service bs. Plus no where else in the whole damn place did I see bottle service.

Update: Some of my  friends stayed and said no one sat in their ""VIP"" area at all that night. If you didn't try to force bottle service on us we would have spent more $$$$. Oh well maybe you'll be more prepared next year and train your staff properly.",3kJ9uPDDD-l8Kri-TfAmng,11,1,1,GfJMPUdrmgOo9MWRO-YvAA

Saturday nights are my favorite days to go - Live music!  Sometimes they have bands from Hawaii, which really brings out the nostalgia for those who now call the ""9th Island"" home.

The food and prices are pretty descent considering it's bar food.  The only con to this place is that they have a tiny parking lot and limited street parking.  But the fact that they even have a FREE parking lot is a plus!  If you can't find parking here, you can always park at a nearby casino.

When you walk in, the atmosphere is super chill. There is a bar on one side, and pool tales, a sitting section, game rental (games like Clue, Scrabble, etc) in the back, and a giant bed. Yes, you heard me right, a giant bed, smack dab in the middle of the place. It's actually quite comfy too, to be honest. 

Anywho, there is a wide variety of things to do at the place, ranging from tic-tac-toe, to giant beer pong. (Beer pong that uses barrels and basketballs.) Luckily, no beer is in the actual barrels. Ew. Anyway, there is a vast variety of things to do there and while you are sober, it can be pretty fun for an hour or two. I imagine if you were drinking it would be even funner, but the downside is, like everything in the Freemont area, drinks are expensive. A beer can cost 6 dollars and I don't even want to know what actual liquor costs. I also went during the middle of the day (around 3:00 p.m.) so there wasn't a large amount of people there. I imagine it can get pretty packed, but the place is fairly large and has an outdoor area complete with more lounge sofas. They are also comfortable, just like the bed.

My colleague and I went there for lunch. There were a couple of problems. I ordered a cheeseburger, my friend a hamburger, both with fries. 
It took about 20 minutes to be served, and that's a long time for a greasy spoon type joint to get the food to your table. Also, my cheeseburger (and the lettuce to go with) was sitting for about five minutes under a heat lamp. Why it takes longer to cook a hamburger than a cheeseburger, I don't know.
My friend asked for mayo on the side. The mayo sat under a heat lamp for several minutes. I asked for the special sauce, which was promoted on the menu but for some reason wasn't on our sandwiches. The waitron told us there was no ""special sauce."" (Double-checked - it was on the menu, not our burgers, though.)
Also, the menu promoted the Parmesan buns. There weren't any Parmesan buns that we could discern.
And I also asked for a pickle. My colleague got a pickle, but I didn't. I like pickles. 
These extraordinary requests sent the diner into some sort of tailspin. Our waitron was diverted by some complicated stock transactions or some such and couldn't find a pickle, the side of mayo slowly warming under the heat lamps, or the missing special sauce that she says doesn't exist, so I asked another waitron for those items. 
Go forward another five minutes, and the replacement waitron delivered a pickle and the side of mayo.
The burgers themselves, cooked medium, were fine, as were the steak fries. Still, 90 minutes at this place and two screwed up orders - well, one very screwed up order at least - was too much.",soG9o5PqmXilKJHpAB777A,3,2,2,mLCVmQn2QS3cspOkdwyybw

My first impression was that Gold Spike is HUGE! There is so much space and plenty of room to walk around, mostly because it was a Wednesday night. We literally just walked in and explored. There's shuffleboard, this ball-tossy game thing (multiple stations), foosball, life-sized connect for, life-sized jenga outside, darts, 2 pool tables, and a little ice skating rink outside as well. There's also a random room with neon everything and a blacklight that makes everything glow. I don't really understand the point of that but it was fun to look at with 3D glasses none-the-less.

The drinks are so affordable compared to most other places and since it wasn't busy, we didn't have to wait. I imagine it would take a while on the weekends, though.

There's a huge cushioned bed near the entrance and several clusters of comfortable seating, including giant beanbags!

My favorite area was probably outside because of the fire pits, life-sized jenga, and random giant golden snake statue. I can definitely see myself hanging out with friends when it gets warmer out! Be careful of the jenga though - it has splinters.

Sorry my review is a little unorganized. This was basically my thought process when I was there all ""Ooh look at this!"" ""Ooh look at that!"" and ""Let's go play outside!"" Gold Spike is basically an adult's Chuck E. Cheese.

There is also a little cafeteria which apparently has good and affordable food, which I haven't tried. I'll be sure to try it next time!

On a Friday evening at 7, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food and the place was not busy. The onion rings were cold, the Philly cheesesteak was cold (the cheese didn't even pull apart that's how cold the sandwich was) and the chicken wings were warm. We also ordered a bacon ranch burger, which was just a burger, because there was no hint of ranch anywhere on the burger.

This place is in the downtown area, the drive from the strip is so 90's, rumor has it that if you bump some Tupac you might see his ghost.

Parking is a hassle, their lot is limited, there are some in the blocks surrounding it, but of course no travelators here, so prepare to trek.

As soon as you walk in you feel real comfortable, you feel that local's spot vibe. The service reflects that. Bar to the right, don't hesitate for your home priced liquor. 

Pool, jumbo connect 4, trash can sized beer pong, corn hole and other things I missed. This place is a good time killer and affordable if you didn't have probability on your side during your trip.

5765445,2014-11-17,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"Gold Spike is this little off-strip casino that I never would have thought to go to. It's down off of Fremont St. near the Mob Museum. No street parking so you'll have to park elsewhere and walk there, which isn't too bad. 

The inside is obviously completely remodeled. They have a bar area, a ""living room"" area to hang out in, and the backyard area. Security guards check IDs and hover around a lot, not surprising since not that long ago this area was pretty seedy. Bar staff is pretty incompetent. Been there twice and both times the bartenders weren't paying attention and rang in something wrong, didn't even look me in the eye to take my order, and it wasn't even a super busy time to be there. 

The living room area is interesting. There's tables, a giant cornhole game in the middle, fooseball, pool table, and a Games area that has lots of board games under lock and key. You can rent them for free if you give them your ID, but NOBODY is ever there. I always end up grabbing random staff because no one will help you if you don't force them to. There's a trippy little room next to it that's some kind of ""art gallery"" but it's very tiny and pretty much all glow in the dark/techno light ambiance. 

Whole interior is super nice and new. They even have a random king sized bed you can lounge on in the living room area. Drink specials are not bad, not amazing. There's a restaurant in there too I've never been to. The bathrooms are hard to find, and nobody has a clear idea of how to guide you. I just use the unisex stall outside the elevators 'cause I don't need that kind of confusion.

Outside has all kinds of fun stuff! Live band on the weekends, giant Jenga, fire pits, more games, and it's all fenced off so it feels pretty private. Really awesome way to start the night! I've played Cards Against Humanity there for a couple hours and nobody bugs you...not even to offer you a drink.

Added bonus is that the staff are very friendly and I enjoyed a delicious prime rib dinner in the Grill. I need to eat gluten-free and our server was super helpful and careful to check with the kitchen. It was endearing and funny too, because our server didn't really know about gluten free requirements, and explained that as they've just reopened and their clientele has changed, they are now getting used to more demanding requests such as gluten free.  In the end all they had to do was remove the au-jus and give me regular, rather than seasoned fries. It still tasted great and at just $12 was a bargain!!

To top it off, as part of their wide selection of beers they even serve Estrella Damm Daura, which is a Spanish gluten-free beer made with barley but with the gluten removed during the process. My only gripe is the cost, which at $10 a bottle is a bit much. I'll be suggesting they stock an American g/f beer instead like Omission; I hope that would allow a cheaper price point!

I'll be back here... a lot!

I never knew how to describe Gold Spike until one of my friends called it ""an adult clubhouse"" which is perfect. When you come to gold spike there's everything to play. Inside there's a DJ booth, dance floor, bean bags,giant connect four, a pool table, and giant shuffle board. If that's not enough there's a whole area outside.

Since there aren't, though, those first few things drag down the venue/ambiance score to a solid 2. I would go with 3, but according to Yelp, that means ""A-OK,"" and a ""Meh, I've experienced better"" really seems to fit the best here. If service were consistently good here and the drinks were priced more reasonably for a downtown spot, at least a 3 would be warranted.

I never expect a stellar experience here, especially early afternoon when almost no one is there, but it's clear who should be in a customer-facing job and who shouldn't.

Our group of 5 walked in and ordered a few drinks from the bartender, Oscar. My friend asked him if we could also order food with him. He said yes, so she asked for garlic fries, and all five of us heard him repeat it in confirmation. We brought our drinks to a nearby table to wait. Meanwhile, a server came by to give us some menus and see if we wanted to order anything else to eat. A few people did put in orders. A handful of minutes later, the first of their orders (fried mozz & zucchini) started coming out. A couple minutes after that, our friend's sandwich came out, but still no garlic fries. We asked the bartender if he'd heard back about our garlic fries. His answer: ""You didn't order any food with me."" Really? We would have understood if he had just said, ""Oh, did you ask for garlic fries? I'm so sorry, I must have spaced that order, I'll put it in right away."" But as it was, he just flat out told us we didn't order food with him, even though all of us heard her order and him give verbal acceptance. Meanwhile, our server, Angelina, was very nice, personable, and accommodating, and apologized on his behalf.

There were was also questionable handling of our drink tab by Oscar and by another female employee who appeared to be at least a shift manager. Our guy friend went to the bar to settle the separate tab we had there and asked Oscar if he could put it on a different card than the one we handed him at the beginning. He didn't know, and the other woman just said ""No."" We asked again because we'd never been to a bar where you can't transfer your tab to another card when cashing out. After going around in a few verbal circles, the woman explained there would still be a pending charge on the first card that would be there a couple days before disappearing. Great, yes, we know -- we understand how authorizations work. Assuming we didn't, though, why wouldn't you just offer us that caveat to begin with instead of just flat-out saying ""No?""

Anyway, this experience isn't necessarily indicative of every one I've had at Gold Spike, but most have been mediocre. Coupled with the over-priced drinks (even during happy hour, which only applies to a few things anyway), even the giant games can't outweigh the ""meh""-ness of this place. It's just so damn conveniently located for us, though, that we'll still end up there for random mediocre lunches in the future (the garlic & herb fries still call to us, after all). Hopefully, Angelina will be there to make it that much more bearable.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,3,0,2,0kARCn6ZqOJv0T9ru2Qd_Q

Drinks are fairly priced, around $10 give or take. Some nights there are cheaper drink specials. Food's tasty, nothing special for a bar though.

The main draw though are all the things and activities to do. Inside there's usually a DJ at night, and always cornhole, in addition to the arcade and carnival games. Outside is where the action's at: oversized beer pong, jenga, and four square, plus the live band some nights.

I returned the next morning to the Grill in order to redeem an underwhelming breakfast at the Garden Court Buffet (see review) as well as benefit from the free wi-fi. I had a very tasty order of Cinnamon French Toast. The two servers and even the chef were very pleasant and chatty with me. The morning was slow so they didn't mind me catching up with some business on my laptop. 

I would definitely return at night with some friends to enjoy the music and the ""recess"" games. I'd also come back for breakfast. Whatever mixed reviews have been posted here about the staff couldn't have been about the two mature lady servers and the African-American chef I met.",kVyOe_qIsGAlk0wo9n9_9g,1,0,4,FLp-i_WQ8gU4xb9xAY8CAA

The ambiance is odd. Kind of reminds me of a dated living room, but we had a nice time playing board games and having a few drinks. I think this was due to the company more than anything else. Once it started getting crowded, louder and a band started up, I had my fill and decided to head out. 

I see who this place would appeal to, but it's just not for me.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,2,r7Pq62tD3WZTrxtOa7xjKQ

The security and cleaning staff walked around with an attitude and looked pissed off, and there were empty glasses and bottles everywhere. The ping pong tables were pretty raggety, but life size beer pong will change your life! Also 4 square is a great game. Very fun place.",DN4UP-5EHYEU0LBI-5tdzw,0,0,4,7IpVCATYYl26JuEVQ2kuVw
5965393,2016-09-07,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"So the other day I put a review on how I had a horrible experience with the security . The manager Adam contacts me directly and tells me to call him and explain the situation a little bit more to him . I then call him and he is super apologetic and very professional and gave me explanations . He then told me I can get back into goldspike and if I have any issues with security to call him directly ! 

Adam thank you for following up and being professional and understanding my side of the story . I will make sure that me and my friends will keep going over there and I will refer all friends to go over there to have a good time !",GPY6X4aM58kdEE5aEi2WWA,2,0,5,1Fif8oc8VlkK0w2zMVdO6A
5979030,2016-07-10,1,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"On Saturday, 9 July 2016 at approximately 11:40pm, I, Nate walked up to the front door where the first Polynesian Male Security at Re-Entry was very kind and informed which line I needed to be in for Male General Admission. From that moment I greeted all security personnel and complied to all uniform security checks as I, myself, am a Security Manager for a Beach Club and Nightclub on the strip but was in return greeted with rude forceful directions followed by a forceful slamming of the stamp on the bottom of my right wrist. Upon looking up at her as to why she was so rude she returned a reaction to belittle and make me feel like I should not come in. Moving into the next phase of security procedure the person checking for contraband and/or weapons didn't even attempt to give me directions as he just forced me around. Moments later I found my group of friends a table near the bar with no further incident.

Note: Sad enough to say this place used to be my favorite place downtown during weekdays since I could never make it out because I manage the nightclub but without a doubt if I could give this place negative stars it would be a 5 star rating for the door. Bartenders on the other hand were very nice in all aspects granted I only bought and drank two alcoholic beverages.

5995125,2017-07-31,0,VMXl3Dm1Nwvgwo1PVYTXbg,"I get what they're trying to do here which is like a hip and cool hang out joint for adults. There's a lot of places to chill and if you're ""lucky"" you might even get the bed to relax on. As for me, my germaphobia begins to kick in so I avoid that attraction. 

I feel like there's a lot of potential for this place. Maybe I need to go during night time to fully experience this joint because every time I go, there's hardly anyone there. As mentioned, there's a lot of space to sit at but then there's also a lot of empty spaces. Maybe it's some sort of a dance floor? 

I think they could add some more games too. There's a connect four and darts inside. Outside there's plenty of things to do like Twister, life size beer pong, tetherball, life size chess, and more. I can see why this place would be fun but I think it needs a lot of maintenance. Many of their chairs and games looks worn out and it makes me wonder when was the last time they bothered deep cleaning any of their materials? 

The drinks are okay. I'm not much of a drinker so I don't think I'm the best candidate to judge alcohol, but the price is a bit on the high side. Last time, I got a watered down alcohol and was charged $15 for it. Talk about buyers remorse. I wish they had drink discounts, but if they do, there was no sign of it anywhere. 

I'm always a bit hesitant to go here but it is pretty fun if you don't know what else to do around downtown. So if you want to have a good time, enjoy the free games and sip on some drinks. But again, I just wish they cleaned their stuff once in a while. Or maybe replace them overall!",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,4,1,3,uGSko4bPVz36Je1hfNKG5Q
