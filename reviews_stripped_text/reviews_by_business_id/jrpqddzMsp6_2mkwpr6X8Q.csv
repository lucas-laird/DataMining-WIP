I tried their chicken inasal, very tender and delicious, the beef pares is a little dry but still tasty, and their goto is a little spicy but not too much which I like. We'll visit again when we go back to Las Vegas.",mSaSufjEpr_KHHP1FLvQnw,1,1,5,ZBszh_-hIqv0kFoIw59DxA

It was tender, lots of flavor and had a little fat ""Sarap"" and the sauce that topped the rice.  Also tried the isaw and fish ball and hmmmm.  The family that owns the place were there working and chatted with them a little bit.  Very friendly and it is good to hear how they started and where they came from.  By the way I ordered egg because I like that combination.  Tapsilog, tocilog, pares (pasilog)?  I am posting some pictures.  Have a nice day y'll?",0HMRHzbXBOPwKoNayCH8Ug,1,1,5,V7f5a7RNnF0uqDQStIFVuA

Why they opened when there were two other restaurants next door that's been there for awhile now is beyond me but I gave it a try.  Usually if a new place opens up they've picked thoughts and pieces of what works and leave behind what doesn't.  

Not here.  

They have buffet style but I went with the to-go option since I didn't want to be there anymore.  Maybe I should have gone with the buffet style and ate as much as I can because with the to-go option, they put the items in the boxes for you.  I kept motioning for more and to top it off but damn I shouldn't have had the need to do that.  The later item (I went at night) worth grabbing you can get next door as well.  The best times to go, if you decide to come here, is in the morning when all the good stuff is being served.   Because by night time, when I was there and after the grocery store closes, everything good is gone.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,1,0,1,7dSjEqT4XOzNSJtEDw6VwA

They've got the sweet, savory, and exotic.  No where else can you sample the type of ""street"" food common on the very streets and back alleys of the Philippines such as Fish Balls, Quek-Quek, Adidas, and Balut.  They even stock Milo, buko juice, and kalamansi to quench the thirst.  Worth checking out especially since they also serve full combo plates cheaper than many restaurants.  Of course, the signature goto is a must-try.",mJ9JXH90CS69O1SWk31F7g,4,3,5,6M5Wk2hNT7OQTswSFZwx-A
