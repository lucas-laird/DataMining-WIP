392489,2017-03-16,0,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"Back in the 70's, we used to watch Evel Knievel jump buses with his motorcycle on ABC's Wide World of Sports.  We would then run outside, build flimsy ramps, hop on our bikes, and then jump over strange objects until someone crashed and ended the fun.  This place is not so much a destination, as a pilgrimage for all us kids who received scars as we emulated the greatest daredevil of our age.
The place is small inside, and loaded with some of the best Knievel memorabilia one can find.  It even includes his trademarked video game and pinball machine!  There's also a small, portable TV with a video loop of some of his more famous jumps.  
As for the food, I opted for the Pizza Slice and Beer combo for $5.00.  That deal gets you a large slice of cheese pizza, with a pint of PBR- definitely a throwback to Evel's heyday.  It was delicious, BTW.  There were other pizzas you could buy, and the bar had plenty of libations available.  I couldn't imagine drinking anything other than beer or a straight whiskey there, though.
So, for anyone who finds him/herself longing for something different in a town of 'differents', this is a great place to visit.",M0znwyt4kt-1rchTMVmzWA,0,0,5,kjNSzIt__OHLjDUiXh1jqg

The place is littered with random stickers and the vibe is fun, laid back. The framed pictures all over the walls are mostly old vegas imagery, some Even Knievel/motorcycle stuff is hanging as well. I especially like the Evel Knievel arcade games in the back, I wonder where the owner found those gems! 

The slices are delicious and the selection is big enough that probably anyone, can find something to eat. They don't concern me but I bet someone who follows a vegan or gluten free diet would appreciate those options on the menu. They are limited, but they're there. With the help of a friend, I tried four different, delicious slices and finished off with the Led Zeppole (fried dough).  I liked the variety of music too, ranging from Social Distortion to Peaches.

While the manager looked like he was high and just walking randomly around the building. No desire to help the line or the bar to Idk maybe help her out! 
I order 1 slice of pizza. It took 15 minutes to reheat 1 slice of pizza. Domino's delivers in under 30 from scratch.  as my pizza slice is being burnt to a crisp as I'm now at the register asking for a refund , which the cashier/ bartender girl has no idea how to give me the refund, finally the guy walking around high on pot finally goes to help her out. Then as I tell him on the way out that it should never take 1 slice of pizza to take f**ing 15 minutes, he then says im kicked out and can never come back. Then keeps cussing at me while outside with 25 people walking by, Let's say this United States Marine kept it in check and left, i could care less if im kicked out or not, Pizza Rock is around the corner, no big deal. But hey customers if you want to wait in long lines with piss poor service and average pizza for over $ 5 go for it. Way to treat your customers, on 1st visit no less lol I'm glad the owner let's his managers work on the clock while high. Seems like a smart business decision. He's working in a kitchen how dumb are you to get high on the job. I hope for his sake that no innocent person gets hurt if he were to do something stupid in the kitchen, not sure if you can claim high on the insurance claim when it happens.

The decor here is cute - very Evel-themed. Parents, be warned that some of the decor is not exactly child-friendly. 

The staff definitely fit the theme of the bar. They seem to be very friendly with regulars. They aren't so friendly if you aren't a regular. We were first over-charged, and the cashier wasn't too happy when we asked about it. Then, when she corrected the total, we weren't asked if we would like the change. It was just assumed that we didn't want it. 

The pizza was okay. It was easily some of the thinest pizza I have ever had. We are talking paper-thin. The pizza just sorely lacked any flavor. Even the pepperoni on the pizza needed more flavor.

There are many combinations to choose from. With or without vegan cheese, olive, jalapeño, mushroom, roasted pepper, onion, peppadew, pineapple etc. I highly recommend this pizza.

It wasn't even really edible.  Most of the outside of each square was burnt to a crisp.  It was so hard that it basically just shattered in my mouth.  My tooth kills now -- gee, thanks a lot.    And if that weren't enough, the middle part didn't even seem cooked.  It looked and tasted like raw dough that was insanely greasy.

Maybe the person who made it was new?  I hope so!  I washed my hands and still haven't gotten the grease off them.  The only reason I didn't give this a one is because I DID like the flavor of the toppings.

Yes Branden, I couldn't wait to get home and slam your crappy pizza. If it was killer, I would have told the world your ""award winning"" pizza was killer. It wasn't so I call it like I eat it. I won't fall for your bullying, sarcastic, intimidating type comments. The only reason you have so many customers is your location and ease of service. In response to your super price deals, no one informed me of that deal. If they did I would have tried it. 

I hope you have a better day as well.  & I hope your pizza standards come up, or I was there on an ""off"" day perhaps.

***ANOTHER  edit because the owner can't accept that her pizza TOTALLY SUCKS. Hey Jacka** FYI your pizza is crap and you know it.  For an owner your attitude sucks, along with your pizza. Beat it clown

Another OWNER CLOWN EDIT.... Owner calls me a joke and tells me he posted my review on his FaceBook account and hundreds of people are laughing at me. Wow I'm glad I'm so funny. Your additional comments are making you a Joke, you know your a clown because a reputable business owner wouldn't even come close to the clowning remarks you have. Your a CLOWN dude. Your a joke fool. If you didn't spend so much time criticizing people maybe your pizza would be half way decent.",_cVcrtErIMf1ReX34hImTw,1,1,1,AFLScDtJ6l-xtCTGkAkrzw

(Warning: visitors from Central Florida in for a vacation) Despite all the quirky Evel Knievel décor, I immediately liked the look of this place because it seemed familiar somehow- like it was something I'd see back in Central Florida. Or maybe I was just seeking any calm away from Fremont Street.

BIG NEW YORK STYLE SLICES
I took a slice topped with pepperoni and jalapenos while Hubs wanted one topped with multiple types of meat. Our slices arrived with a pool of oil on top from the cheese and limp from the size... but we already knew this wasn't gourmet pizza. This was diner pizza- comfortable and flavorful. The price was also great.

ORDER AT THE COUNTER AND THEY'LL REHEAT
There were about a dozen varieties of pizza on display. We chose what we wanted and they'd reheat and serve it to us in our seats. Next to us was a long bar full stocked. The entire vibe of the place was very chill. A little dark. It reminded me of an old city pizzeria.",nlQGyti20c07rpTSYYoNZQ,0,0,4,DLwuLvwkGasL-ObfjqS2yA

After wandering around Fremont building up an appetite, we looked around at a few options and decided that pizza sounded good.  With the cool exterior and punk rock music coming from inside we knew it'd be a unique place.  There's Evel memorabilia all around and interesting people. The girl that took the order was polite and friendly and they even went out of their way to make us micheladas which I know is not very normal for a pizza place.  They actually had some kind of local lime beer though and it turned out really tasty.  The bartender clearly knew what was up and it went great with pizza.  As far as slices, I'd say this is very good pizza, with great crust and quality cheese. I got a version of a hawaiian pizza with japenos which made me wonder why no one has ever made this before.  Great combo.  My date got some kind of ""Barry White"" pizza which she said was really good.  She is very picky about pizza and never offered me a bite AND ate all her crust which she never does so that really told me something.  Overall I loved the ambiance, decor and vibe and will definitely be coming back when I'm downtown.

Myself, I tried the meatballs for an appetizer, and a slice of cheese. Both very good. The marinara on the meatballs was out of this world good!

2707817,2017-01-23,0,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"So i'm a Vegas local and I've walked by this place a bunch of times but have never tried it. Tonight I finally gave into my pizza loving heart and decided to try this joint and boy am I glad I did. So this place is a pizza joint and dive bar that is dedicated to Evel Knievel and is adorned with shirts, stickers, pictures, etc all in the motorcycle riding rebel's honor. When you walk in you are greeted with an awesome bar, pinball machine (Evel Knievel themed of course), and some booths in the back. There are tons of flavors of pizza to try and tonight I opted for a couple of slices of the Goblin Sausage which is topped with sausage (duh), bacon, pepperoni, and all the gooey fatty cheese you could ever wish or dream to have. The dough is rolled right there in shop fresh from scratch and the pizza sauce is also made fresh so you know automatically the pizza is going to be more amazing than any Evel Knievel stunt. This place is surprisingly cheap with a slice of pizza running around 5 bucks (for my slice). A slice of plain cheese is probably cheaper but I ordered one with a good amount of toppings.  

The service was phenomenal as well and I was treated more like family than a guy who just walked through the door. I felt so welcome here and felt as though I had been coming for years even though this was my first time. So now onto what you all care about which is how the pizza actually tasted. First off trust me when I say I've had a lot of pizza in my life, I've had cheap fast food style pizza and I've had overpriced 30 buck hipster pizza that is organic and tastes like van carpet. Let me tell you that no pizza I've ever had compares to how tasty Evel Pie is. I mean the crust isn't too crispy, the sauce is tangy and has the right amount of kick, the cheese is perfectly melted to where you get those little crispy parts in the middle, and the slices are nice and big New York style slices. You just can't find pizza this good anywhere else in the city and I've tried. They even run a deal where you can get a slice and a beer for 5 bucks in total. All in all I love Evel Pie and I will definitely 100% be coming back to this place whenever i'm craving a slice of pizza or when I wanna cheat on my diet. Great place for locals and visitors alike.",S9dDf0JqSMAvusp5f-9bGw,8,2,5,PGAq8bgRMyEUzhcpq1WM6Q

Came in here for their happy hour this week. This place has their happy hour from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm everyday. Pretty fantastic. Most places don't do a happy hour Friday through the weekend.

They had $3 drafts of Coors, PBR and Bud Light I believe as well as $4 wells. Didn't see any food specials though.

They did have a $5 slice of cheese and PBR.

Standard menu with some interesting toppings. Man candy (candies bacon) and rattle snake sauce definitely caught my eye. 

I went ahead and got the traditional pepperoni. Like most of the by the slice joints, pizza is made before hand and they simply take a piece and heat it in the oven. Never been a fan of the pizza that's been sitting around for a while but this slice was pretty tasty. Thin crust and great sauce made this slice pretty epic. 

They also have a salad option and a calzone as well. Staff is great. The vibe here was pretty amazing aw well. I believe the son of Evil Kinevil is one of the owners hence the shrine like set up behind the bar to the great daredevil. 

Music is always on and the bartenders are pretty rocking too. Danny was new that night but she was definitely serving up good drinks and great vibes.

2934838,2017-06-22,5,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"This is for the pizza by the slice. 1st of all, they consistently burn it. Looks great in the window then they burn a third of it. 2nd the part that's not burnt tastes mediocre at best. At over $4 a slice, I expect better quality, and I've gotten better quality at chain pizza places and the food courts at Sam's Club and costco. 3rd the service. I understand if you're busy. And I usually don't even talk about service in reviews. But when your actual food is bad and expensive (for what it is), then I don't know,  maybe I should expect you to give my pizza to someone else and make me wait even longer to burn my other slice. 

Instead of here, go to Naked City Pizza. Better pizza,  better prices, better service. They're not speedy, but they're good. Maybe their interior isn't as well designed but that's all that's lacking",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,8,2,1,H-OdvjfooSho4U12_usqCA
2937564,2018-01-13,0,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"I enjoyed Evel Pie. I like the theme and the feel of this place on Fremont St. The staff was all real nice even at 10PM. 

I went in for their award winning gluten free pizza, because I heard it is amazing. I ordered, was told it'd be 20 minutes, but 30 minutes later I'm still waiting for my pie. 

It wasn't busy, so I'm not sure why my pie sat on top of the oven for a while even though the person who took my order saw me stand up from the table getting a little impatient. I saw a pizza on top of the oven, thought it may be mine, so I slowly start inching towards the counter. Finally, someone asks if I was here for pickup and gave me the pie. 

The crust is deep dish, airy, and it has that yummy browned cheese on the edges. Yup. To die for. The sauce is a little sweeter and herbaceous which I love, and it wasn't drowning in cheese which I really appreciated. Simple and to the point. The crust was a little greasy, but it is 10PM on Fremont St, so I wasn't expecting something healthy at that point. 

Here's the thing. I don't expect pizza places to make an extra effort and have a gluten free crust. However, the fact that Evel Pie put a bunch of effort into making a stellar crust for those with a gluten free allergy is impressive, greatly appreciated, and pretty close to being worth the $21 for a plain cheese gluten free pizza. I'm even willing to look past the wait time. I would definitely suggest that people come and grab a bite here - gluten free or not.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,0,0,4,L4hw0GFtxcsC0B6Pu_qv-Q

We were walking around Fremont on a very busy Saturday night, a semi decent band was scheduled to play on the main drag so the place was poppin.  We stopped at my favoriate outside bar which is located at the Golden Nugget and ordered some very large cocktails.  We did the loop around Fremont, and once we got towards the end we decided to grab something to eat.  

Spoke with the bouncer at the door and he said we could seat ourselves.  Luckily they sale their pizza by the slice, so I ordered 10 slices of different varieties (For 5 people) and we waited a bit for it to be warmed up.  Evel Pie is pretty hipsterish, and it was certainly busy but we were able to find a seat.  We probably waited a total of ten (10) minutes and our slices were ready.  

It may have been the booze talking, but this is some delicious friggen pizza.  Everyone pretty much devoured whatever I ordered no questions asked.  Thin crust, great flavors and just solid goodness and not too greasy.  Definitely very close to NYC pizza, and probably the best I have ever had while in Vegas.

Definitely make this place a pit stop to re-fuel, and get something in your belly to compete with all the booze.  Even if you don't drink and are in the area, you better stop by and get a slice you won't regret it.",mD8T6tegVU9v06osh8W2sA,34,38,5,hA7uUzlHeQEtUZ0su6_jAA

Both slices were amazing; The White Pie was rich and full of flavor, and the crust added some great texture, crunch after crunch. The Pulled Pork Pie was a pig lover's dream, covered in pulled pork and bacon. Crunchy crust, cheese, pulled pork, bacon. I'm dead.

The only dis-merits I gave for this establishment:
1) Music was upbeat and fun.. but a bit too loud. It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with our group of friends who dined together when we visited last week.
We would have preferred  the volume to be turned town a couple of notches.
2) Tables are a little too close together (Personally, I'd like just a teensy bit more space between each table)

Thus a solid 4-star rating. In fact, I'd give it a 4.5 rating if that was an option!",E9yRSEtayhAKwnje3B4lDA,1,0,4,EkHCqSQkVXnL34OmwPNicw

I'm sure this happens all the time with them but I was mistaken for someone acting like they never got their pizza order but actually did. It was a very busy night for them, I saw and was patient. I had been waiting for about 10-15 mins with no pizza in hand. I ordered 2 slices. I saw customers that ordered after me get their orders, so naturally I checked in on my pizza and I was rudely told that I already was served and given my slice, when I actually did not (side note: the guy behind the counter was talking it up with a girl and i may have interrupted a good conversation ?). Someone behind the man that was ""helping"" me assured him that the slices they were doing for me burned, so they were preparing new slices. Another 10-15 mins pass and I checked in (still politely and tired from that night's festivities) and the same aggressive man yelled at me this time and said ""what are you still doing here?! You already got your slice. I'm not giving you another one"". The gentleman behind him over heard and told him, ""no her slice is almost ready"".

Each slice was around 5 bucks. The prepped pies were displayed to the right of the bar and servers will gladly describe each concoction. The pie selections vary but the ones I ordered both nights were delicious and had nice crunch from the toasted dough.

I was joined by the bf and fellow Yelper, Kevin. Both interested in trying the rattlesnake pizza. I'm allergic to pork so I stuck to the Barry White. The guys enjoyed their pizzas although both agreed they still didn't really know how rattlesnake tastes. Personally, I assume it's for the best but I'm not that adventurous. My Barry White was delicious. My only complaint would be to offer more pork free options by the slice (although I realize I'm in a huge minority) but no one ever wants to split a full pie with me.

I was downtown waiting for a concert to start and I remembered about the deal at Evel Pie where you get a cheese slice and PBR for $5, so I was off to grab some slices and beer. The line wasn't long inside at all, but there was a good amount of heads at tables. They have a ton of pizza options and there's a display behind a glass case showing you what they have to offer. I got a cheese slice (cheesy rider) and pepperoni slice. There's fold and eat pizza that is legit and then there's fold and eat pizza because it's so floppy you have no other choice. Sadly this pizza was the floppy kind. When I picked up the pizza slices they belly flopped. There wasn't the slightest of any structure in the crust. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste great either. For $5 I can see why people come in for this deal because it's perfectly doable if you are sober or drunk and the slices are big. I would stop by again when walking around downtown for the deal if friends wanted to, but I'd personally order from nearby Pizza Rock when downtown and craving pizza.

They have 20 inch whole pies here at Evel Pie that range in price from $24-$30 if you want more than a slice. 

Cheesy Rider $4 per slice
Pepperoni $4.50 per slice

With signage, pictures and even the old school video game and pinball machine, it is definitely themed appropriately.

The pizza was nice and thin and the reheat gave it a nice crispiness to the crust. Topping were also on point. I had the Hog Heaven, BBQ sauce, smoked mozzarella, fontina, pulled pork, ""man candy"" bacon and some red onions. It was loaded up to say the least and had some good flavors. it was kind of steep for one slice and the topping to crust ratio wasn't great.

By the time that it came not only was it cold and soggy, we had already gone to bed and my concierge desk had to call me several times to wake up to approve the driver to drop off the food. Since I assumed this issue was in part the fault of the driver or the app, we decided to give this place a second chance one night when we were downtown. The vibe of this place is definitely unique with all the stickers and Evel Knievel related items hanging from he ceiling. When we walked in it was pouring rain outside, the door was wide open and the place was freezing cold. Since it seems like a walk in establishment we went to sit down at the bar and were told we had to order at the cashier. So we stood up and walked over. I am gluten free and knew there was one thing on the menu I could have - the Gluten Free pizza. The gluten free pizza comes as a deep dish and with three included toppings for $21. Since I am aware of how SMALL this $21 pizza is (about 6 inches wide and four inches deep) I decided to ask for heartier toppings to switch out for. However, they don't allow it not even for an extra charge per topping. What a disappointment. So, I accepted the pizza as is and went to cash out. Upon receipt of my change, I was given less than what was owed. When I asked for the receipt the cashier said ""oh I didn't give you all your change"" granted it was literally change and not dollars, but none-the less taking a tip without asking is not good business practice in my book and that was clearly what he did since he gave only dollars and no cents. The pizza took well over 30 minutes and came out overcooked and extremely crispy on the outside and dry on the inside. The three ""toppings"" were not generous and the flavor was absolutely missing. Honestly, the deep dish is more air than anything. I will not be coming back due to the price point, flavor and poor customer service.

I've been dying to check this place out for a very long time. Unfortunately I don't make it downtown anymore as much as I would like to. My sister-in-law is in town and we were in DTLV for the second night in a row.

We were headed to first Friday and wanted to make sure we had something somewhat solid in our bellies before stuffing it full of junk food. We swung through Evel Pie and picked up a slice each. I was ecstatic to see such incredible pies on display. Such fluffy crust, chewy and delightful, this place does it right. Reminds me of my East Coast home. I grabbed a pepperoni slice, which after warmed up was extremely greasy but I sucked it up with a napkin. The husband got a cheese and my sister-in-law picked up a Greek slice of pie. Holy moly, we were delighted. 

The staff was super nice, real people, and I loved the atmosphere. We will absolutely make Evel Pie a regular stop in our routine. It's super helpful that it's right next to where my husband works.

We got three slices and three bottled waters for $25. The cheese slice was four dollars, pepperoni was $4.50, and the Greek slice was $5.50. Pretty reasonable for such a bad ass pie.

Turns out we ate pizza with no rattlesnake. 
Wish we could've had it the right way...and no we didn't ask for another slice and it was too busy to explain the mishap.

4105829,2018-03-17,5,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"When it's 1am and you're wrapping up your downtown Las Vegas bar crawl, your tolerance for dropping $5.50 on a slice of pizza just might grow exponentially.

Such was the case when my friend and I found ourselves at Evel Pie after he surrendered to his pizza craving. It looked crowded earlier, but we seemed to hit a temporary dip in the crowd and didn't have to wait too long in line to order. Our slices came out pretty quickly afterward, presumably after they'd been run through the oven quickly to restore them to a high temperature point.

Although my friend was content to go with the $6 deal (cheese slice + house beer, which is the light and bland Evel Ale), I did grab some specialty slices for $5.50. I recalled seeing the Snake River pizza on TV when Evel Pie was featured on an episode of Food Paradise, so I went for it. Frankly, the rattlesnake sausage tasted much like regular pork sausage. The slice was otherwise quite sparsely adorned, so I'm disappointed that I surrendered to that impulse.

I much preferred my second slice, the Balls to the Wall. Massive dollops of ricotta and reasonable amounts of meatball made every bite a treat. I didn't even have to add parmesan or red pepper flakes to this one. The thin crust was otherwise similar to the other piece, substantial and chewy and neither soggy or crunchy.

I don't think I'll flock downtown for Evel Pie, but they're a fine choice for a late night snack if you're walking around Fremont Street.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,4,X0hKSpQ6-Rbb7lMbBLcz0w

So we were excited, naturally, to try Evel Pie after a dance night on Fremont Street. We went in to get our pizza and were relatively pleased with the Pizza. My partner loved the Barry White slice; but the pepperoni left much to be desired. If we were just remarking on the Pizza, we would give an average 4 star rating. 

However, we were mortified by the outright classist, anti-homeless, and possibly racist behavior they exhibited. My partner noticed that a young woman was sitting at a table with only juice to drink and no food. She decided to offer to buy the woman a slice. We suspected that she was homeless, and felt that she might want something to eat. As she approached the counter to place the order, one of the employees warned my partner that ""just so you know, she's in here all the time asking people to buy her pizza."" He said this as If to encourage my partner to rethink her gesture. My partner was a little annoyed, but graciously thanked and dismissed his concern. However, soon after we noticed the security at her table asking her to leave. We were very disappointed to see that they actually packed up her food and forced her to leave, even though it was completely paid for, including the tip. She didn't appear to be bothering anyone and there was plenty of open seating. We were dismayed and disgusted... we couldn't even enjoy our meal and the pizza is forever marred in our minds.

They do pies and slices. A few specialty slices are interesting: I like the rattlesnake which utilizes real snake and pheasant for the meatballs. What's more metal than snake meat on your pizza?!

What's pizza without beer? They have bottles, draft, and cans to choose from. Good selection of all. If you'd like something a little more heavy, they do have a full bar available, as well as wine.

4628447,2016-11-12,0,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"I visit East Fremont frequently, and I noticed that a new eatery opened up in a previously occupied space. Frankly, what got my attention was a sandwich board offering a slice of cheese pizza and pint of PBR for $5.00. (Not a bad deal:  per the menu board, a slice of cheese pizza is listed as $4.00, and a pint of domestic beer as $4.00.)

Evel Pie looks like a combination of an old fashion NYC pizza joint (+) a neighborhood dive bar. The inside is comfortably worn, but clean. It's decorated with eclectic kitsch--most paying tribute to Evel Knievel. There are small table games at the bar, and on the tables. The bar has a good selection of beers on tap, and in bottles and can. They also serve cocktails.

But I'd like to focus on the pizza. (You can buy slices or whole pies.) What I liked best about the pizza was the crust. It was a really good NY style slice: the crust was not too thick, not to thin; it was nice and crisp, but not dry; and when you folded it, it had a really nice ""crunch"". The topping was of good taste and quality, and sufficient quantity.

It wasn't too crowded while I was there. (Maybe because it was midday, mid-week; maybe because this place had been open for less than a week.) But I can see this place as being a great place to hang out with friends for some ""day drinking"".

Bottom line:  If you are a local, it's a nice place to hang out. If you are visitor, it's a nice place to get some good food and drink at ""non-tourist"" prices.",psU9IaROPzivxgO2jDcmJg,1,1,4,OtqzZqANRkhIifpHEO67VQ

The walls are lined with not only some incredible Evel Knievel photos, but also photos of Vegas legends like Wayne Newton and Siegfried & Roy. There are Evel Knievel toys sitting high above on shelves and a bike hanging from the ceiling. There are also 2 functioning games, a stunt rider arcade video game and a pinball machine.

Now back to the pizza. They serve up pretty large slices, and the best things to order are the ones that sound like odd combinations or toppings. We split a slice of the snake river pizza, which is topped with sausage made out of rattlesnake. I also enjoyed a Maui Waui slice which is a classic Hawaiian pizza, but with added jalapeño slices (which is how I'll be ordering my Hawaiian pizzas from now on). The pizzas are made with a cracker thin crust and are heated again in the oven before being served to you, so don't be worried about lukewarm pizza, because it will come out of the pick-up window screaming hot. 

This is a fun spot that I'm looking forward to taking friends and family from out of town to when we take them down to Fremont street, as it's not even a block away. I enjoyed coming here and I can't wait to come back again.",ny5uD7wcIZ01hUXE50Qz2Q,0,0,5,HZT6AjxwAbLCQ7SyNVJ6Eg

The pizza was good, but I've had better.  To be fair, I am quite picky with my pizza, and nothing beat real Long Island, NY pizza!  Evel Pie has a nice a thin crust and decent flavor sauce that thankfully they use sparingly.  Their garlic knots/roll things had NO GARLIC whatsoever and were VERY dry.

Have a full bar but no grenadine?  
Order at a Counter, no waitress service, for lunch at least and they bring you the pizza. Right after we got ours a homeless guy walked up to our table and asked if he could have some. He was quickly escorted out of the place. 
Now for the food, both pizzas were really good. They 20"" is all of that, a huge pie with a thin crust very reminiscent of what I've had in a pizza shop in Brooklyn. Plenty of pepperoni was scattered across the top. The Olivia gluten free John was ordered with sausage and onion and was also pretty big, and being deep crust I managed to eat 4 out of 6 pieces. (We took the rest home, looked for the homeless guy to give him some but he was not around). 

The music was so loud was nearly impossible to have a conversation. I guess I'm too old but I didn't enjoy the visit at all.

The large number of positive reviews indicates I am likely in the minority, but I was really disappointed in the slice of their white pizza I ordered.

When I picked up the slice, the pizza had such a large pool of grease on top it almost seemed like they must have poured oil on it before heating it up. Then, biting into the pizza disappointingly gave way to a super chewy cheese experience (I'm guessing all the oil leeched out of the cheese, leaving the cheese as a deconstructed rubbery affair). Sadly, the flavor was bland to boot.

We did end up here after midnight, so who knows, maybe it's just an issue with the night shift. The only really positive thing I can say is that I started out hungry (having skipped dinner) and after eating the slice was satiated. But at $6 for a slice of rubbery white pizza I doubt I'll be back.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,3,1,2,711c42FzkHukMNpvnZOrbg

Opting to dine family style at the kitchen's discretion, a few Beers plus a punchy local Root Beer in hand, the first look at Evel Pie's product since their Grand Opening shows that the kitchen and their ovens have already improved substantially with a bit of seasoning, the multipurpose Dough used to make everything from Garlic Knots to Zeppole baking up with a good char and just the right amount of stretch plus a cornicione that bubbles just enough to let patrons know that nothing here is rushed, the crispiness and air pockets imparted by giving the yeast  enough time to ferment.

Offering both whole Pies and those by the slice, the former obviously a fresher choice though those arriving during peak hours are rather certain to receive a hot slice straight from the rack, it was with five different combinations of toppings that opinions were formulated of a Pizza that manages great consistency by way of good Ingredients and a 50/50 Mozzarella that is not applied overzealously, the ""Cheesy Rider"" and Pepperoni Slice with Cup and Char-style rounds always available for purists while ""Hog Heaven"" with housemade Barbeque Sauce plus Brown Sugar Bacon, Pulled Pork and Red Onions is more of an acquired taste, the ""Goblin Sausage"" taking the idea of 'Meat Lovers' pretty seriously with Pepperoni, Ham, Italian Sausage and Bacon while the ""Barry White"" Pie features puddles of Ricotta and Fresh Basil atop a light Garlic Sauce.

Smartly offering his own style of Meatballs as an appetizer, the three for $8 Orbs tender and supple in a pool of crushed Tomatoes, additional items from ""Evel's Sides, Salads, and Other Stuff"" include a Caprese with Fresh Mozz and good Balsamic that would not be out of place at most of the Strip's fine dining spaces save for its service in a take-home tin, the Pizza-joint staple Buffalo Wings a bit less surprising, though still quite good for those who are into such things.

Lingering over good music, great conversation and what was already plenty of food, it was with the dining room really revving up for business that Justin brought forth ""Evel's Giant Hot Pocket Rocket Calzone,"" the three Cheese blend inside what is literally a whole Crust folded over soon to generate a 'Cheesepull' that exceeded four feet of creamy texture and a whole lot of flavor while Vincent's now-famous Gluten-Free Pie arrived shortly thereafter, the ""Detroit-style"" Deep Dish subjected to a double ferment that has thus far limited the restaurant's capacity to keep up with demand for something that is not just 'Celiac-friendly' because it is trendy, but truly a passion project with a crispy edge and buttery softness that seems almost impossible to achieve without the elasticity typically associated with Wheat Protein.

Rounding out the night with 'Led Zeppole,' the obvious reference to a band who named themselves such because they figured the idea would quickly crash, Evel Pie's Dough defies the idea of a heavy Doughnut by generating small Puffs that emerge from the fryer light and virtually oilless, the powdered sugar dabbed-on as opposed to being dumped over allowing the yeastiness to come through while a sidecar of Chili Flake Honey is an idea so simple and satisfying that one wonders why they've never seen it before.

****1/2Taking the concept for what it is, the marriage of a high-flying Daredevil's relics to a Pizza Joint circa 1972, Evel Pie has achieved a tremendous amount of success in under four months by pairing a passionate Pizza Man to an owner willing to take some chances, the answer to every New Yorker's prayers answered in a rather unlikely place with the only questions remaining just how much better the 'slice' can get, and what these guys will come up with next?",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,2,5,jusGt4eaDSXJxepUkdblfg

5465912,2016-12-06,10,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"From the mind of the creator of Golden Tiki....

Actually, that's true.  Brandon Powers has teamed with Evel Knievel's son and other folk to make a new (and only I've seen) themed pizza place downtown.

It's next to where Insert Coin(s) used to be, and is literally a hole in the wall, as any good pizza place should be.  Again, as with Tiki, ""theme"" is key here, and the walls are fully decorated with memorabilia of the daredevil. One of the more impressive aspects is that the place feels dated and lived in.  It comes straight from the late 1970's-early 1980's, and feels like it's been around forever, which is a good thing, in my opinion.  Where so many things look sparse/artsy and pristine around Vegas, this place has some rugged personality, accompanied by a classic rock soundtrack.

The pizza is decent.  I'd like to try a few more varieties, but what I had was authentic ""pizza dive"" food.  Coupled with the numerous beers on tap, again, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that this was a place that you grew up with.

The arcade machine was broken, so that was a bummer, and again, I want to try a few more varieties of pizza (we had pepperoni and sausage with a salad), but the place had a relaxed vibe, and made me a little nostalgic for my youthful eating experiences.  Like Tiki, there's a lot to look at around the place, albeit smaller, so it's worth exploring.

It's a place that you've been to in your past, yet still probably haven't yet.  I look forward to sampling some of their other selections the next time I make my way there.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,25,28,4,Onu_EecxnmjqSokE_qVa5A

Their special which I did is a beer and a slice of cheese pizza for 6 dollars. It's a good deal, you get a pint of PBR and a big slice of pizza. The beer was nice and cold which was good. The pizza is obviously the star of the show. The crust was light and chewy and had great flavor to it. It wasn't too dense and the dough wasn't too much in relation to the sauce and toppings. The sauce was a red sauce that had a touch of sweetness to it. And they made sure the slice was super cheesy. None of the ingredient outshone another one. They all complimented each other very well. 
I have to say I was impressed that even though we all ordered separately we all got our slices within a good timeframe so no one was waiting too long. I was lap impressed that when one slice came out a bit toasty on the edges the person behind the counter told us that a new one was being made but we could have that one while we wait for the other to cook. The toasty pizza wasn't even that toasty and we said that we didn't need another slice but within a few minutes another slice had magically appeared at the table. Of course we couldn't turn it down and it was definitely not wasted. It was definitely a great experience between the service and the food itself. I will definitely be back.",98BB-9KO_RySfLuafz9TKw,1,1,5,xQMOxSOyG_bqeVa1AnbUqw

5672002,2018-01-18,0,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"I'd had this place on my radar for a few years now. Somebody said ""Best pizza EVER!!"" and I was here to verify or deny the validity of that statement. It was dinner time, and I felt pizza would be a great dinner.  As I entered, I eyed the tent-sign at the door. It spoke of a six dollar beer and pizza deal. I was intrigued, and I felt like experiencing the six dollar beer and pizza deal for myself.
     I walked up to the counter to check it out. I asked about the deal, and the lady behind the counter said 'it's a slice of cheese pizza and our house beer.'  I nodded and accepted. Six and some change later I had a receipt and they had my name. I found a table to sit down at and wait for them to call it.
     Just a few minutes later, my name was called, and I retrieved my pizza and my beer. The beer was cold, and the pizza was hot. For six dollars, I was quite contented.  As I ate my pizza and drank my beer, I took in the place. I watched amusedly as a small child tried to play a very old arcade game. Doing a wee bit of research, this game is as old as I am! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Cycle (Just in case you want to know how to play it when you visit.) 
     The place seems to be a shrine to the Evel Knievel. Who was an awesome guy to have a shrine too. I'm not sure why. But there's a bunch of stuff dedicated to him. Portraits, statues, pinball machines, and a stunt motorcycle very old arcade game. Maybe this place was started by his relatives? Maybe this place was just a huge fan of the stuntman's work? I dunno. But it's a fun place to pop in for a six dollar beer and pizza. 
    I'll be back on my next trip out to Vegas. Maybe I'll get something else. But thanks!",43WiflwfTbmjizIfxvQ_jw,2,2,4,BgEZstN0Gzb-jZjvVVgZ4g

I love everything about it. First of all, slice of cheese pizza and  a PBR is $5. Their Happy Hour is a whole pizza and a pitcher for $20. Can't go wrong there. 

Love the vibe inside. They have a couple window seats so you can enjoy your food and watch people walking down Fremont St  which let's be honest, can be quite entertaining. 

Their pizza selection was good and I really liked the flavor. Tasted like an authentic slice. My love had a slice which had garlic knots as the crust! So delicious.

5718271,2017-06-07,0,5keoVVM81g-nJw0Zdpl1nA,"More of a tourist trap than a pizza place. It took more than 15 minutes for my slice to come out. And all they were doing was heating it up. Also, they don't have Italian seasoning, garlic, or pepper flakes on the tables. This place is more about attracting tourists to spend money that it is about having a good slice of pizza. The slices were unreasonably thin. I got a cheese and a vegan slice and the vegan slice was just little bits of pepperoncini, olive, and onion on top. It's like they were thinking that people that don't eat meat or are vegan just like to eat less. All they had to do is put more vegetables on the slice and it might have been worth it. And they have the audacity to sell it for $6.50. And it's not like the cheese slices any better.  It hardly had any sauce on it and the cheese  wasn't even that flavorful. Again, less of a pizza place and more of a tourist trap.

We opted for delicious slices of the following!

World Famous Snake River Special- mozarella, rattlesnake sausage, carmelized onions and roasted red peppers.

Barry White- mozzarella, pecorino, fontina and ricotta. 

Hog Heaven- bbq sauce, smoked mozarella, fontina, pulled pork, man candy bacon, red onions. 

Classic Pepperoni

Garlic deez knots- garlic, pecorino & parsley with their famous Evel's tomato sauce.

The pizza is always delicious, fun and flavorful!

Only in Los Angeles which was good as well, and popUp pizza which is also around this area downtown vegas, the thing I like about pop up pizza is that have a specialty vegan pizza so they don't charge you per topping like this place does. But it's really good and could crave a pizza craving from a newly vegan like me. Subtract one star only because the place was kind of a hassle to get to. Having to find parking, and it's downtown on a busy street. It was kind of a ridiculous hassle to get to just for a take out pizza. If I hadn't all ready paid for it online I probably would have just left like I don't want it that bad...  lol.. if they want to or other business in a high traffic areas want to sell take out more, they should probably have a back drive threw area, or advertise that they will send someone out so you can just drive threw and pick up your order if you all ready paid for it. So people don't have to find parking, or deal with the hassle of large crowds cause I was not trying to be social at the time I was just trying to get take out and go back home. Lol.. this would be a cool place to hang out w friends tho. It has a hipster vibe thing going for it. It's a cute little spot. And they have vegan pizzas that actually taste good, even just cheese.
