We are hitting up Vegas for Crue concert on Sat, and looking for places to chill on Friday night. Was looking for bars that play classic rock, and this place came up in the list. I clicked the website but it's down, so then I called to get more information, and the dude who answered the phone was a total dbag.

Teri W. review was perfect. Actually, food is very good for bar food. Free food during half time was surprisingly awesome. 

We will be sure to stop in when we come to Vegas, even in the off-season. The friendly vibes from owner and staff makes this a can't miss spot.",pdV53O7BW5HpzJRLQqn9uw,2,1,4,AG1lrmiN3pQ0ALGXJymoBA

My favorite and over any other bars in SD.  WHY you may ask? First of all, my first time ever going here, I felt like home.  Home where any CHARGERS fan belongs and should go to.  Second, they used to have $5 pitchers of beer but now I think is $6 but what the hell? They have free food during the half time.  Can't go wrong with that.  Then, if you are wearing anything Chargers, they give you a raffle ticket to get in their Chargers raffle.  I especially love the REGULARS and the STAFF bec they are very friendly.  Who doesn't like the CANON?  OMG THE CANON!! SOUND THE ALARM!!! haha that's for all the people who knows what I am talking about.   I would like to say hi to Michael.  Met the guy and he is super NICE!  The only down side for me is, people can smoke in the bar.  Hey, it's Vegas.

Unfortunately the day of the game we weren't allowed entry into the bar due to some of the people in our party not having Charger gear making them apparently ""Not Fans"" of the team.  At first we thought they were joking until they started getting a little irate.  We were given the choice to buy their house shirts for $10 and gain entry but respectfully declined.

I think this place can shove their policies up their a$$ along with the money they missed out on from our group.  Just because you wear a jersey doesn't make you a real fan.

We got to the pub about an hour before kick off and already, the place was packed! It really didn't bother be because I was amazed by all the Charger fans that were there all decked out in their best Charger gear! It's like home away from home, or better? Ha. 

Don't forget to wear your Charger gear so that you won't feel left out. But dont worry, everyone there is super friendly. The service may be a little slow, but considering that the place was super packed, your expected to wait a little longer for your food. 

The drinks were inexpensive too!

You can feel the electricity through the place! Excitement is everywhere....ok I'll stop talking about the stripclub, I'm supposed to be reviewing Michaels Pub.

This place rocked! Felt right at home with all the Charger fans. Jerseys everywhere!

GOOD:
- Food and drink specials. Chicken wings, burgers, sandwiches, fries
- Free food at half time!
- Charger love everywhere u look
- Hardcore fans, bandwagon fans, ceiling fans..they got it all!
- Tvs everywhere

BAD:
- Small bathroom. All that beer makes you pee! Only 2 stalls
- Bar located 5.5 miles off the strip (if you don't have a car, cab fare adds up)
- Got pretty hot in there. All the body heat made the temperature rise

UGLY:
- Last two plays of the game! Can we get some better play calling please?
- Can someone please block Ray Lewis!?..why he gotta smash my boy Sproles like that!
- Raven fans who rolled up in there, we showed them (even though they got the last laugh)

Overall, we had a blast. Being in vegas, cheering on your home team with a bunch of Charger fans is the real deal!

We usually go to our regular locals bar Club Car which has the best bartender in the world Regina but she is not there on Fridays, so we thought we would go to Michaels Pub. 

We had a blast! 
This place is awesome as awesome as a local dive bar can get lol 

We each ordered a long island and were impressed how strong they were and ordered a second we were buzzin a lil just off of those two drinks..and trust me we are not light weights so they do make some pretty great drinks. 

Then we met a group of guys that are regulars and they bought us these shots of chocolate cake, now I am so not a fan of fruity or sweet drinks but because of how strong the great bartender made the shots I enjoyed them. 

This is a locals bar so don't expect any thrills but the locals and regulars that come here are very friendly and the bar tenders are pretty awesome! 

I will definitely be returning here!",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,2,2,4,6vbbdCEt3hIhn6YW6inaKw
3731705,2009-11-18,0,oe6srp_GGRncy5ODHNfW0g,"My friends and I were visiting Las Vegas from San Diego and heard about this Chargers bar where we could watch the game. At the cross streets Flamingo Rd and Rainbow Blvd, the place wasn't hard to find at all. It is right behind to a drive-thru Starbucks, which is easy to see.

We got there about 45 minutes before kick off and all the booths were taken, so I suggest if you want a good seat, go earlier! We were lucky enough to grab a spot at the table in front of the projector screen next to the loudest crowd in the house!

The only downside was that it was hard to get our food order in, but that is completely understandable considering the amount of Charger fans in the house. I got the hamburger with fries and shared buffalo wings among friends. The hamburger is pretty typical, but still good, and the buffalo wings had a good amount of spice -- not too spicy, not too mild. Oh, and a pitcher of Bud Light was only $7!

Psst, free popcorn in the back room! And when it's a slow day, they have free nuggets, fruit, or whatever they feel like giving you for free ;)

Overall, a GREAT experience. Don't forget to wear your Chargers gear! Otherwise, you will feel out of place, and you won't get a raffle ticket to win prizes given during halftime!",dceUPs8J893qgE6GsBKXiw,1,0,4,ugZoVmPLHciLeTyk6aMg4w

well better have your chargers gear on, as we were not let in unless you had them.  luckily for us, even though we were unprepared with the correct dress, which seems to be a running gag this trip to vegas for me.  the place actually sold some pro charger shirts for us.  

the place is great, good food, and beverages.  and being a little piece of san diego, the people there were awesome.  and they were complete and totally loyal chargers fans in the desert of las vegas.  who would have thunk?  but if you are ever vegas and want to hang out with like minded charger fans, this is the place to go.  get there early as it gets super packed and crowded.

cons...it's out in las vegas.  and have your charges gear on so you can get inside.  and be wary of the budda guy, he's really loud.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,2,0,4,FCVIZcejSuKolmISsxgkpw
4005842,2011-02-04,2,oe6srp_GGRncy5ODHNfW0g,"This place is awesome.  I came here during the football season; you know when the Chargers were still playing? But I never got a chance to complete my review.  It was a great experience for me and my friends even though the majority of them were not Charger fans.  I love the atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the people!  I'm so glad I found this place and will definitely be back next year!

When I walked in, the place was decked out in Charger gear;  including the people of course.  Since I was wearing Charger gear myself, they gave me a raffle ticket.  During half time, they raffled off Charger prizes.  My cousin won a cap, and my boyfriend won a coffee cup; of course he gave it to me.  

I had lots of fun here, cheering our team on, high fiving everyone around, and screaming and yelling from the top of my lungs.

Just be careful though, this bar allows smoking while serving food, so for all you non smokers, this place might not be for you.  I haven't tried the food yet, so I can't comment, but they have alcohol! Haha!  Oh, and they sell adult novelties in one of those bear claw type joy stick arcade games.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,2,3,5,QwBV8Vjc9Y9V4f0a3vh4qQ
4132527,2009-09-23,14,oe6srp_GGRncy5ODHNfW0g,"Let's seee. 

Do I really want to watch the Charger game on a little ass plasma TV while other NFL games are shown in a room full of Dolphin (yuck), Broncos (ew), Cowboys (double ewl), and 49er fans (yikes) at a sports book back at the hotel? Orrrrrr go off the strip and chill with fellow members of the charger nation with the game projected on a big screen? Let's hop in a cab and head down to Michael's Pub. 

We had to bust out the GPS from the iphone to help the cab driver find this place. After declining to go to the strip club suggested by the cab driver 100 times, we finally found MP in a small strip mall. 

Moments after we walked up in the joint, I instantly knew we made the right choice of coming here. Charger fans everywhere, wall to wall of the small bar. 

During the 1st quarter, 6 Raven fans decided to come into charger territory. SD fans were really cool and respectful to them, but we had to let them know it was our house they entered. Boo birds sure gave them a warm welcome, and the chants sure made them feel uncomfortable throughout the game. 

""BALTIMORE: SUCKSSSS!!""
""RAVENS: SUCKKK!""
""YOU: SUCK!""

I think the ""GET THE FUCK OUT"" Chant scared them off by halftime. 

Despite our 1st loss of the season, I'm sure we will meet Baltimore ravens deep in the post season! Chargers will always have the last laugh, because ""THATS JUST HOW WE SPROLES!!!""

5674496,2011-11-14,0,oe6srp_GGRncy5ODHNfW0g,"If you are a San Diego Chargers fan living in or visting Las Vegas, you absolutely HAVE to go to Michael's Pub for a game!!!  Get there EARLY, especially if it is a big game or a divisional rivalry.  I know that, at least for Broncos games, the bar will be packed at 10am for a 1pm game.  

So, it's not exactly close to the strip, or in the best neighborhood, but it is worth the trip if you are a diehard fan!  There is plenty of parking, since the bar is located in a Sunflower Market strip mall.  Make sure you wear your Chargers gear, or you will be out of place.  I don't remember ever seeing someone there NOT in a Chargers jersey or shirt...Except for once, we were there early for a doubleheader MNF game and there was some DB in a Jets jersey, but that is a story for another day....If you wear SD gear, you will get a raffle ticket for the halftime give aways.

As for the menu, it's bar food, so it's not gourmet, but everything I've eaten has been really good.  They have drink specials as well, usually on buckets of beer.  When I say that this place gets crowded - I mean CROWDED.  By gametime, it will be standing room only.  There are a group of regulars who have saved seats, so there is very limited open seating for non-regulars.  Normally this would make me mad, but I understand that the same people have been going to watch games here for years.  Maybe one day that will be me with a reserved seat! A girl can hope! :)  If you are lucky enough to get a table,  be prepared to share.  If there are open seats, the owner will ask if other people can sit with you.  I have met some really fun, cool people this way.  Because it is so crowded, the service can be a little bit slow.  Just order a bucket and settle in!  The best thing is that they have FREE food at halftime!  You heard me, FREE!!  They change it up, and there is usually anything from wings to pizza to spaghetti.  And a popcorn machine.  I can't complain when there is free food for fans!

As I mentioned before, they have giveaways at the half.  They usually have a lot of prizes.  We've won fridge magnets, cooler bags, t-shiirts, hats, etc.  They even give away jerseys!  All for being there and being a fan.  

This is a really passionate group of people.  There is even a guy with a mini canon who sets it off on all Chargers scores, just like at the stadium!

Warning: it is a small, crowded place.  If you are really bothered by cigarette smoke, this may not be the place for you.  But if you are a huge Chargers fan, it is worth a visit.  This is BY FAR the best Chargers bar in Las Vegas.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,1,4,SvDqQ5aJgDJEdTH126H9gQ

My sis and I were in the mood to enjoy a few adult drinks and hang out at a locals spot so we chose Michael's. This pub is close to my house so we just walked over and prepared ourselves to get down and lushy. 

Glad we did, had a few strong island's. Then an awesome local group of guy's showed up and we all started hanging out and playing pool. Had a blast all night! 

We tried at the request and offerings from one of the guys a drink called ""chocolate cake"". Yeah that was dessert in a glass for sure, the rim iced with sugar, mmmm interesting. 3 shots of those creepers put us in the mood! The mood for food!~ lol 

The staff is warm and friendly, they have great food also 24/7. 

The patrons are the best crowd in comparison to any local bar I have been to here in Vegas. 

They play a mix of music, country, alternative, classic rock, 80's.
