So we have been looking for a new sushi place, and I believe we found it in Kabuki. The AYCE is $3 more, but the better service, food, atmosphere and lack of line is well worth it. So long Yama. We had a great meal at Kabuki and the servers were exceptionally hospitable to our two year old daughter (who can be high maintenance at meals), including giving her a special kid's cup, plate, spoon and fork - just like we were at home!

My friends and I got dropped off in the center across the street to dine at another renowned sushi place (Yama sushi?)  When we took a look at the cluster of people waiting outside, my empty stomach dropped.  The wait was about 45 minutes, and I said Hell to the No.  So I yelped for sushi nearby, and found Kabuki.

We worked up our appetites running illegally across the street in heels and dodging cars.  The strip mall where Kabuki is dilapidated and straight up scary looking, but don't be fooled.

Kabuki is clean, well decorated, and run by wonderful Japanese people!  All you can eat is 25 for dinner--

There is a separate menu with special rolls, nigiri, maki, appetizers, cooked entrees (mini udon!!), and dessert to select from.  We ordered a little bit of everything under the sun, down to dessert... so I can safely say everything here is bombskies.  Definitely try the desserts!!  They have a few different mousses that are delectable.  

The waitress was so sweet and suggested items from the menu.  She checked on us every 10 minutes with a smile so huge her eyes were actually like this ^_ ^  . 

Kabuki makes me so happy.  So happy in fact, I never regretted eating so much sushi when I yakked a later that night from partying too much.  TMI?  Yea, probably.  Sorry... but it was that good.",N2rKwbY_tAodn-jG_HqUNQ,5,2,5,ZhrNq3wvmXaSEkSNNZwqjw

I'm originally from Japan so usually I cook own or just eat ""kind of Japanese food"" in Vegas.
Sushi was fresh than all other AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas! 
Chicken Katsu was yummy, Teriyaki Chicken's sause was not American Teriyaki sause.  It was yakitori taste yum yum. 

Honestly I felt this place is like a very cheap ordinary restaurant in Japan.
It's enough for me! coz I can't find any places like here for this price.

I got a coke, hot tea, two pastas, and two deserts having the bill come out to be $20ish for two people! I am definitely a fan 1000%... yeah thats not a typo its 1000%!!!! 

I will be sure to stop by here when I am in town, be advised they are closed Mondays. They have daily specials that they write on a chalkboard so even if you check out the menu online, don't make up your mind just yet. I wish I had a bigger stomach so I can eat it all! I sooo wanted to try the squid ink pasta on special that day T_T... you know they don't have that at every run-of-the-mill pasta place! If you haven't heard of squid ink pasta or think its disgusting, I say it's because you haven't eaten enough or that your culinary world is very small and I feel very sorry for you.

This place gets 5 stars in everything! The decor is tasteful and establishment kept very clean. Service was exceptional, very polite and   thoughtful. Now the food! OMG the pasta was cooked PERFECTLY no mushy noodles or undercooked noodles here. Then the sauce... the taste just makes me want to cry with the pure genuis. I ordered a a clam pasta cooked in the Japanese style. I loved how the clams were cooked to the perfect time, if you know about seafood you know that once you over cook them they get all chewy. This place know defiantly has a cook that know their stuff and is worth whatever salary they are getting and them some. ; ) The other person I was with ordered a kurobuta pork sausage pasta which was on the daily special board. The tomato based sauce had the slightest bit of cream taste to it, and had an amazing quality of ingredients. 

For desert I had creme brulee  and gelato. The creme brulee was served shallowly in a good sized ramekin so proportionally there was more of the tasty caramelized crust than custard that normal. Also with the gelato it was served with a intriguing black honey that just pair perfectly.

I encourage, no wait... I mandate that you eat here and then go out into the streets proclaim the goodness of Dining Bar - Kabuki to others!!! (okay at least eat there and if you have time do your own damm rambling, glowing review on yelp)",wLh4YepDaBzQ1JMrj5fDzQ,4,3,5,NX-JOteE0xNEz_7mtHg8Hg

The deep fried oyster was a bad bad idea.

I generally frequent Ichiza, but when I called there was the usual one hour wait. When I arrived at Kabuki on a Sunday night, there was only one other table with patrons (which caused me to pause), but Yelp reviewers generally get it right so I tried it. A ""check in"" with 10% off sealed the deal to give it a try. I have tried several AYCE sushi and Japanese restaurants over the years and I would say this is one of the better ones. Their nigiri sushi was quite good, good quality sashimi with a small piece of lightly seasoned rice. The maguro, hamamachi, salmon, and uni were very good. I also tried and liked the poki salad and shrimp tempura. The teriyaki beef and chicken, and rolled sushi were average at best.

3052337,2010-11-05,0,5zpAZqSrsdltaduk67jOow,"Frankly I find it very hard to recommend this place.  

First, the good things!  I got a Restaurant.com coupon, and was totally craving some good Italian food, but I'm also a big fan of Japanese food so this combination of Italian-Japanese sounded great.  The location was okay, though a bit hard to find.  The place was well-decorated, as you'd expect for a Japanese place, and the waitress was nice, though not particularly energetic nor friendly.  

The menu was interesting.  Since I wanted to try their uniqueness, and not where they're the same as any other Japanese place, I wanted to focus on the pasta.  We ordered a chicken pasta with Japanese mushrooms, along with a salisbury steak made of beef and kurobuta pork.  For an appetizer, we had the calamari tempura, and dessert was a gelato with Kinako and black honey.  Here's each in turn:

Calamari Tempura:  Nothing special, despite being on the specials menu.  It was exactly what it says:  Deep-friend pieces of squid (Japanese cut) with breading.  

Chicken with Japanese mushrooms:  Weird.  Basically it was a spaghetti in a broth, with a few pieces of chicken and some mushrooms in it.  I can't really describe the taste, aside from it being fairly bland and a bit salty.  It didn't seem like the mushrooms added much to the flavor, and all together seemed like a thrown together mish-mash.  

Beef and Kurobuta Pork Salisburg Steak:  Entirely mediocre.  It's just a Salisbury steak.  This one came with a salad, two slices of orange, a sprig of broccoli, and small pasta birdsnest.  The cold pasta thing was really good, actually.  Saved the dish from being entirely forgettable.

Gelato with Kinako and Black Honey:  This was pretty good.  Seemed like a sweet cream gelato with a bittersweet honey and kinako crumbs, which added nothing almost to the flavor, but was a good choice for some texture to what would otherwise have been plain ice cream.  

Overall, the service was a bit a slow, and not very friendly, but not rude.  See photos of the dishes if you like.  

Not bad, but seriously, with all the good places to eat in Vegas, I won't waste my time and money going back.",UIdX_cI1awxvPH7kIFKpXw,0,0,2,JoOcGlUwHL2iPIQeC8a0TA
3483263,2010-10-31,0,5zpAZqSrsdltaduk67jOow,"We ate here yesterday night and was pleasantly surprised.  We went quite late and there were only three tables of customers.  The cute Japanese waitress greeted us and brought over their daily specials board and explained to us what were their specials of the day.  Wasn't sure what to expect from their Japanese/Italian fusion spaghetti.  We tried a place out in L.A. that served this type of cuisine, but was not impressed with the taste and price. Surprisingly, this place tasted quite good.  We started out with the herb salted fried chicken appetizer.  It was deliciously moist and delightful.  Then came the Kurobuta katsu don, OMG it was soooooo good.  The pork was so tender and full of flavour.  Then we had the Tarako & calamari spaghetti and the mentaiko and crab spaghetti.  The dishes came out wonderfully presented and there was this huge mountain of pasta.  They were well worth the money.  The pasta were al dente and the sauce were plentiful.  The Tarako spaghetti wasn't as tasty as the crab one, but both had quite a unique taste to it. 

We will definitely go back and try some of their other dishes.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,1,1,4,T7mBJhHgaPIa5MlLSgq1Bw
3525608,2012-08-24,1,5zpAZqSrsdltaduk67jOow,"I'm really not searching for a new sushi joint but a co-worker recommended this place so I had to try it.

It's located in an old strip mall behind Target and it's kind of hidden. It's a pleasant surprise when you walk in. It's small yet intimate and tastefully decorated.

My husband and I went for an early dinner so there was no crowd to deal with. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. She asked if it was our first time there and made suggestions of their top selling items.

I can't remember everything we ordered but there were a few standout items. The Calamari Tempura's batter was nice and fluffy. The Poke Salad was fresh. The Orgasm Salad had lots of fresh tuna and the salad dressing is so yummy.

We ordered so many different rolls that I wish I grabbed a menu so I could list them all. One of their best selling rolls is the St. George Roll. I'm not a fan of rolls so huge that there is no way I could fit it in my mouth unless I unhinge my jaw. Even though it was too big, it was still good. We also had yellowtail nigiri and super white tuna. They were very fresh but a little heavy on the wasabi for my taste.

I loved the dessert because they offer more than the typical mochi ice cream or green tea ice cream. We had the Green Tea Panna Cotta and Black Sesame Blanc Manger. OMG! Melt in your mouth delicious!!

I really enjoyed this AYCE restaurant because their fish was fresh and the service was friendly. I have to say that I enjoyed the appetizers and dessert a little more than the sushi. I would go back again if I'm in the area.

4050534,2010-04-16,0,5zpAZqSrsdltaduk67jOow,"Sooooo I had high expectation coming in here for dinner since I was pretty impressed of how well my lunch went here, but my real goal of dining here was to experience Japanese/Italian fusion.  Sadly the food fell short this time around. 

I figured my friend and I can order 3 entree and an appetizer or two since i had a feeling it'll be another cycle before i ever make a trek back.  Also doing a quick sweep increase our chance of finding that one dish that would have us ranting about it.  Despite our effort we didn't find anything that we wanted to share with the world.

My friend started off by ordering Edamame to snack on.  Came out hot, sprinkled with salt which we highly prefer over cold Edamame.

Kobe Beef Capacio: I've been eying it for a while because I need protein, but unfortunately each thin slice of beef was old since it was deep brown around with edges.  Masked with some heavy mayo type sauce and cheese which would take away the flavor of fresh beef.  I hate to waste food so in this case we got lucky.

Spaghetti ""TARAKO"" with 4-5 small calamari rings that tasted fishy and red dice tomato chunk. This this was a bit of salty with a little chopped basil to give it a more light, fresher balance.  For Japanese NO.1 Traditional Pasta I expected a tingle, but the dish as a whole was just a wasted filler at $10.75

""MISO"" Carbonara:  My friend order this as it came with chunks of slice pancettas (non smoked bacon) and a creamy Miso sauce.  This dish was our fav of the 5 we ordered since it was rich in flavor.  The sauce had that fatty cream to it, and at $11.75 this was the best dish they had to offer.

Last but not least we ordered the Stacked Kobe Beef and Vegetables Sauce w/ Original Demiglaze Sauce.  This was the biggest disappointment.  It was basically three old tough, puny Kobe chuck stacked with diced tomatoes and tomato paste smeared between them for $18.95.  The presentation was lovely, but it was such a huge let down taste wise.  For as much as we paid i expected at least better meat quality and better sauce that compliment the beef, not the taste of tomato paste and vegetable sauce. Which again, over did it on 'Kobe.""  At this point I'm thinking it's not really Kobe after all

Finally we finished off with the Gelato w/ Soybean Flour & Black Honey:  This was our dessert to ended out meal. 2 small scoop of Gelato drizzle with black Honey.  Tasted petty good, with a hint of coffee.  It was just OK for $3.95

Although I didn't enjoy my dinner here, I'd still give them an ""A"" for effort since they are trying something different, and I can't hate them for that.  The place is cute and the waitress can be a easily overwhelm with more than 3 table since she takes the time to go though the menu with you.

Another down side to everything was that the dishes were kind of small for what you pay for.

'Up' side was that the paste in our noodles dishes was cooked perfectly.  Without my $25 gift certificate I purchased from http://www.restaurant.com/microsite.asp?rid=367093&mcn=00070526 I think I would have been more displeased with my experience. It all seems to balanced out for 46bucks:  2 drinks, 2 apps, 3 entree, and 1 dessert.

Verdict:  Italian does better.  Well prob never come here again for dinner, but it was nice to get that out of the way.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,1,1,3,H1Ovl3JdAK_Ufdbb63N2wQ
4107028,2012-03-09,0,5zpAZqSrsdltaduk67jOow,"I always love celebrating victories on exams with AYCE sushi, and I'd heard good things about this place. Came here on a Thursday and had to look at a back corner of the strip mall to find this restaurant. Somewhat surprised to find a pleasant, darker-colored decor that was a bit more welcoming than some places, and some nice orchids and whatnot spread around. Tables seemed to be made of real wood too.

In terms of nigiri, cajun albacore and yellowtail were the most impressive for me, followed by super white and salmon. St. George (5 piece), Red Rock, and baked lasagna rolls were great, and Daisuke and 007 rolls were pretty good. Mussels seem a little smaller than at other places and come 3 per order, but it also seems healthier because it's not slathered in that fatty sauce, and there's a bit of teriyaki sauce and whatnot that puts a different spin on it. I also enjoyed the green tea panna cotta for my dessert, and it comes in a fun little bowl.

However, I was not that impressed by the amaebi (sweet shrimp). Texture was too mushy, temperature seemed a bit warm. Also, you'd think we might get better service in terms of being asked for our orders more frequently since we were either alone or with one other table during a relatively vacant lunch hour. My other menu complaints are the limit of 1 dessert per person for AYCE (those desserts are rather small, as you'd expected) and no dynamite on the menu.

Overall, the little issues add up and I can't give five stars yet in good faith. Still, it's a nice AYCE sushi joint that you should try once, and given that it's not too far from Yama, it's good alternative if the latter is too crowded for you.

I was really excited after reading other reviews about the neat things they had on the menu and was ready to splurge. When we arrived, it was dead. The only people eating there were the people who worked there. She gave me a lunch menu with 3 item combos and sushi lunch options. The prices were high. I would expect the items to be a few dollars less. They are going to have to be a little bit more creative if they think they can survive in this economy, especially with Yama Sushi across the street that does all you can eat at lunch for about $19.00

I had the 12 piece sashimi lunch platter for $12.00. It was fresh, the cut wasn't spectacular and the only think I was offered as a dipping was soy sauce. It came with a bowl of rice. Free hot tea. I felt ripped off because i am spoiled by the wonderful all you can eat spots like Island sushi and Yama. Even Hamada around the corner that has ridiculous high prices I would choose over this place.

For a place that has a horrible location, on the corner of the Target strip mall off Flamingo and Maryland, they should consider bringing down the prices. 

The service was very good, there was a Japanese lady that served me and she was very nice and I didn't try everything else on the menu so I can't say this space sucked.

It was about $25 for all-you-can-eat sushi. And although they had an okay selection of sushi, I got to say that there is nothing that really stood out for me that was actually good. Most of the sushi just seem to be average.

There is only one other group of people that was in the building when we arrived. And the service seemed to be really really really slow. I would understand if it was packed and we had to wait between five and 10 minutes to even get a simple drink refill, but when no one else is there parentheses for obvious reasons and parentheses that shouldn't make any sense.

I really wanted to give this place is a good shot. But unfortunately I am disappointed. And two stars is the best that I can give it which is probably the lowest rating of ever given for a sushi place let alone all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant for me.

I've been lucky enough to consume sushi on 3 different continents and Kabuki may not give Osaka a run for it's money, but it is a welcome surprise in the land that Chicago mobsters built. It's off the beaten path, which in Vegas means at least a mile from the center of the action, and it's affordable, fresh and creative. Gyoza and miso staples paved the way for a rainbow roll for lunch which proved to be of highest quality, important for even the lowliest of sushi joints. I'd give it 5, but I'm a snob who lived behind Fugakyu in Boston or 5 years and hold it as a measuring stick to, well, everything...if you want a quality meal in Vegas without casino-inflated prices, Kabuki is a sure bet.",lEKe1e9ie9qluiLqdOhJfQ,0,0,4,c3xM7VeZuU9fE8LaiKvqAQ

First off, Kabuki Dining Bar describes itself as serving ""a combination of traditional Japanese cuisine...Italian cuisine prepared and served in a Japanese fashion.""  Although they do offer sushi and your typical Japanese entrees, I would suggest trying their other items that are more unique and not found at any Japanese restaurant.

Located on the East side of vacation, it's a rather spacious restaurant that doesn't get too crowded but has a steady following.

The most important thing to pay attention to is the blackboard of daily specials that the waitress will bring around to you as she gives you the regular menu.  She'll go over each item and this is where you should really pay attention.  We found the best dishes to come off this very board!  (A previous highlight has been their Scallop, Shrimp, Garlic Anchovy Cream Spaghetti.)

This time we started off with the Parma Prosciutto Mushroom Salad ($9.75).  I now recall there not being any mushroom on this salad at all.  There was definitely the prosciutto on the greens with a drizzling of extra virgin oil oil, salt and pepper, and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice.  It was decent, but now has me wondering about the mushrooms.

The Husband ordered the Vongole Spaghetti with Red Sauce ($16), which is ultimately pasta with clams.  They offered this dish with a red or white wine sauce and it came off the daily specials board.

The real winner was my choice of the Japanese Pumpkin and Chicken Cream Sauce ($15), which also came off the daily specials board.  What can I say, they really know how to do their cream sauces here.  It's so good, so fatty, and just done so well!  Yum!  And I'm usually not the biggest fan of chicken in my dishes, but there was something so tender and perfectly cooked about the poultry in this dish.  I was immediately impressed, and the Husband was equally surprised at how tender those little morsels were.  I can safely say their cream sauces just wow me to no end! 

Service - the waitresses are really nice and do their job, including bringing us extra dishes so we could share and things like that.

Things to note: soft drinks are by the bottle, they don't come from a soda machine.  And don't forget your gift certificate from restaurant.com!  

Like I said -  stick to their daily specials board or other unique entrees and leave the sushi and typical stuff for your regular Japanese restaurant.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,5,4,MOkCfeoZbiDLSOSmy_WxUQ

I had fried oysters. They came with salad, rice and a little bit of pasta. Very tasty!. My husband had sort of chicken and he was also pretty happy. The waitress was really sweet. I'd would go back there.",ISzjIv3zjj9nCYY-Qju_CQ,0,0,5,DdvL9cxbjZzOr4mB7PAu5w

The severs are kind and it's a lovely room, in contrast to other AYCE joints.  Looking forward to many returns.",YuABJc2x2pSDUw2HD6bzWQ,0,0,5,Hw16ACaJr_QBXP5nMbWMDA
