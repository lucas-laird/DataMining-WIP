Honestly, I have to rethink how I give out my 5 star restaurant ratings because by far this food is in another category.  You would have to travel to France for better French food.

19421,2008-03-14,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"How appropriate that the half-brilliant food at Picasso should so closely resemble the minor-league paintings, courtesy of the restaurant's namesake, that grace the walls of this mostly adequate fine-dining establishment located ""lakeside"" at the Bellagio Hotel.

You might think that I'd have felt cheated having been presented with such inauspicious works from an artist who's membership in ""The Pantheon"" is so rightfully secure.  You would be wrong, however, to make that assertion.  In my mind, even the least-interesting Picasso still veritably hums with the genius that has conferred upon him the status as a near-consensus choice as the single most important artist of the modern era.

And just as one must, in the course of appreciating the art, ignore the piggish chauvinism that the artist himself exhibited during his reign... one must likewise ignore the missteps that mar the canvas of Chef Julian Serrano's menu if one is to be receptive to the more vivid charms that are in evidence.

The space itself is quite lovely.  Rich and sumptuous, with dim lighting that is punctuated by spotlights shining down on both the tables and the million-dollar canvasses that line 3 of the surrounding walls.  The fourth wall opens up onto the aforementioned ""lake"" and its ever-present circus of projectile choreography.  As cheap a thrill as it is, I must confess an abiding fondness for this brand of contemporary Vegas kitsch.  You would do well to note that the fountains are freakin' LOUD, though... and if you are the skittish type you might ask for a table a little farther away from the sideshow.

Our meal commenced with an amuse of boiled quail egg and smoked salmon on a skewer served with a small cup of leek and potato soup garnished with slivered almonds.  The skewer was rich and silky, with the appropriate notes of salt and smoke, and the soup was earthy and luscious, the almonds providing good textural contrast.

My first course was a bowl of butternut squash soup, (a holdover from the fall/winter menu perhaps?)  Regardless, it was cloying and unremarkable.  It was helped, slightly, by the addition of some tasty bread and butter but on the whole it left me with that arched-eyebrow ""Oh Lord, here-we-go"" look of disappointment that I sometimes get.  Yes, sometimes.  REALLY, it's only SOMETIMES!!  Stop hitting me in the shoulder, dammit!

Second course found me sizing up a dish of langoustine tails with asparagus in a saffron broth.  Sounds delicious, right?  Well in this case everything clicked and I'm happy to report that delicious is exactly what it was.  A brilliant little piece of chamber music on a plate.  A richly satisfying meditation of harmony and balance and if I weren't such a neurotic snob I would have licked my plate clean.  In my shame I must confess that the best I could do was to sop up the remaining broth with more of that tasty bread.

For the main course I selected the veal chop and for the most part was happy I did.  The chop itself was delicate and toothsome.  My only complaint is that the pan jus upon which it rested was lifeless and ordinary.  Pan jus is one of those things that, when done properly, can elevate a simple dish toward unexpected heights.  Such an elixir should be part of every great chef's arsenal but on the night in question it's addition did little more than color the plate.  Pity.

My friends and I decided to supplement our menu with a plate of the night's special meat, an offering of Kobe beef, which we felt necessary to compliment the fine bordeaux and Rioja we had assembled.  When it was presented to the table, however, it was distressingly overdone.  Not even borderline, mind you, but just short of grey-all-the-way-through.  How it even made it out of the kitchen is a puzzle I am sure I will never decode.  To their faint credit, the offending dish was whisked away and replaced with a suitably-cooked replacement.  That said, the beef was only great, falling well short of the magnificence that it should have shown.  What a disappointing, yet somehow fitting metaphor for the overall experience.

One aspect I feel compelled to note is the incredibly gracious treatment shown to us by the Head Sommelier, Robert.  We brought our own wines and he really went the extra mile in creating a superb experience.  If only the restaurant as a whole had manifest such careful attentions I imagine I would have expected nothing less than the Young Ladies of Avignon to grace the walls.  As it was, the wine service was enough to catapult Picasso in my esteem to 4-star status.  And if you hit it really big at the tables, ask Robert to open one of the 1947 Cheval Blancs he has in the cellar.  Just be sure to let me know what time the reservation is.",yDbtyjFQKhqLhCFjfqQ08A,3,4,4,a7pQIOx8dXKBwRivNGvlCQ

56221,2011-10-30,13,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Picasso (not the painter) restaurant in Las Vegas is an absolute embarrassment to the Michelin star rating system.  I would bet the farm that Bellagio paid the Michelin inspectors a large sum of money to get their 2 stars.  Picasso does not merit even 1/16 of a star compared to some of the Michelin star restaurants I have had the pleasure to dine in LA, SF, NYC, Paris, Barcelona, and London.   

My wife brought me here for my birthday and I was looking forward in experiencing their desgustation menu.  The pan-seared scallops tasted like if they were from the same kitchen making the scallop salad for room service....Very dry and bland in flavor.  The halibut was dry and lacked any flaky texture.  The lamb had no flavor whatsoever.  I even forgot what I had for dessert.  

I will admit that the service was very good.  The waiters were attentive and stirred up good conversation with us.  The actual Picasso paintings were beautiful and i really enjoyed viewing them.  I come to Vegas a lot, so the Bellagio fountains don't really thrill me anymore.  However, I can see how most people would find this to be interesting for their dining experience.  

If you have experienced at least a 1 Michelin star restaurant, Picasso will disappoint you.  I would avoid this restaurant at all costs and use your money for the tables instead.

The food was alright, it's not something I'll crave again. The real Pablo Picasso art was impressive though. I had the 5-course tasting menu.

Chicken croqueta with a tomato based soup: It was a good sample of Julian Serrano's tapas restaurant in Aria.

Main Lobster Salad with an Apple Champagne Vinaigrette: It was good.

Pan Seared Scallop: one of the better scallop dishes I've had. The crispy outside soaked up some flavor that made the dish.

Turbot with Asparagus in Hollandaise sauce: It was very plain.

I have eaten in some good places in Europe that were pricey but coming in at £350 (yes pounds) for two, it's just not worth it. Actually, it's not worth a third of that. I don't know how they got those Michelin stars but it certainly wasn't up to European standards, nowhere near.
The menu is unimaginative, totally bog standard posh restaurant fare. The service (except one nice chap who got scowled at for chatting to us) was cold, dull and condescending - I know what foie gras is, though thanks for the automated explanation, yes I know that Riesling is a grape variety, cheers - and if I didn't I wouldn't want to be told by someone as ill informed as your good selves in a manner that made me feel ultra-thick!

I have no problem with a multi-course meal, with each course proportioned appropriately, but Picasso is not in that category.

132137,2007-11-22,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Eating here is a life-changing experience unless you were to the manor born. I wish there was a little more granularity in the Yelp rating system -- there's 5 stars and then there's these sorts of singular experiences.  I've only been here once and it could be said I'm still paying off the tab, but what a night.

Picture it:  Las Vegas, 2003.  It was right after Thanksgiving; Herself and I were young, in love, and wanted a night to remember.  We go to the Bellagio concierge desk and ask for a restaurant recommendation.  She takes out the big book of all the menus and we browse.  Picasso stands out, but I do not remember the prices being on the menu (and yes I do know better).  The computer says they're full but she calls over anyway and they'll make room for us in the early seating.  I still regret not knowing how to give her a tip.  

Herself starts getting ready and I go for a swim to make room for dinner.  It's late November in Vegas and the wind is cold -- I lost as many calories from shivering as I did from the deliberate aerobic activity.  6:30 is on us in a flash.

We descend the escalator into the depths of the Bellagio's north wing.  They really should require jackets here, but I got in anyway.  They put us in the back.  Of course, ""in the back"" was filled with museum quality art.  Not to be indelicate, but there was even a Picasso print in the bathroom.

Late fall brings the white truffle tasting menu and the ""usual"" menu degustation.  We go one of each and I have the suggested wines.  I'll never be a real foodie because I can't recall the specifics of either of our meals, but she remembers her main course was filet migon resting on a bit of truffle oil coated goodness.  I had a quince tart for dessert and hers was a poached pear with a white truffle creme anglaise.  

When you think of fine dining service, you're thinking of Picasso.  More effort was put into the delivery of our meal than into most of the new houses being rapidly knocked up around Las Vegas.  The head waiter/sommelier didn't make me feel bad for going for eau de Lake Mead rather than Pellegrino (I don't think they had come up with artisinal water yet).  He also took the time to explain each glass of wine he brought over to me.  When Herself asked why the table of Japanese hipsters were having their wine poured into a separate glass serving vessel thing, I explained what little I knew about decanting.  I asked if the bottle they were having really was that old and bunged up with sediment, the sommelier said no, but it was $600 so he felt like he should give them the full monty.  I never was made to feel out of place.  

I had the dreaded ""can you come and talk to the credit card company"" walk of shame up to the host stand, but I worked it out.  Considering how expensive Vegas is now, the price scales pretty well and the wine pairings weren't out of line with what you'd pay in a lesser establishment.   

While I do okay for myself, my dining choices really should stay more in the In-N-Out and Pluto's line.  But Vegas is like LA, except worse.  When in Rome, engage in conspicuous consumption.  Suspend reality, clean yourself up, and try to get a table.  It would be nice to sit by the windows, though.  And next time, I'm going to wander around and soak up every piece of art, even if it's rude.",yhRa9ZaPTTAVPRAph8ZWkg,1,1,5,O0LhXK7eDazk4TIVBgZr8A

After arriving late to our already last minute reservation Picasso was kind enough to still seat us and we ended up dining next to several authentic Picassos in a place overflowing with elegance. Being the grandma that I am I was terribly happy to be sitting next to a 90 year old couple and a group of women in their 70s all dressed up for a night out (so cute!!) The impeccable service at Picasso was worth every penny of the $150 share of my bill. Be forewarned, it is of course a prix-fix menu of either $113 for something like 3 courses or $150 for 5 (i forget). They were even courteous enough to offer some of my friends $50 entrees instead since we weren't told about the prix-fix menu. 

We began with a crème of carrot and ginger soup which was immensely refreshing and compliments of the chef. I continued with the warm quail salad with sautéed artichokes and pinenuts. I've also heard their ragout of seasonal vegetables with fresh foie gras and jus de poularde is incredible so if your a fan of foie gras, part of me feels like this is where it might be just as good as paris. I then continued with the venison on a bed of risotto rice which is not game-y at all and very delightful. Surprisingly I forget what I had for dessert but I know it was delicious. I think it was a chocolate souffle. They also brought out a tray of chocolate treats for the table. 

I'm very big on the small details and Picasso was attentive to every one of them. They weren't rude at all when we took too much time ordering, were the last people to stay until closing, or when our inappropriate comments were heard over the quiet chatter of the dining room. 

If you're planning on venturing here make sure you come to spend a lot of money, definitely get the wine the sommelier recommends, (he was incredible), and grab a seat on the patio if its warm or by the window to see the bellagio watershow if its chilly.

You can go outdoors and watch the water show. Plus, you can feed the ducks the bread. My cousin can communicate with the ducks. She figured out that if you clap your hands, the ducks will come to you.

I would recommend ordering from the right side of the menu. First, they give you a Pheasant Croquette and a drinkable cold Potato Vichyssoise. 

I got the white asparagus, and the quail salad. They're both very grand. For an entrée, I got the veal. And for dessert, i got the Trio of Meyer Lemon, Vanilla, and Rasberry.This place is actually expensive, so I split my din din with my bro. One meal is $115! But if you get the special, that's another $40.

Now, if you're a fan of soups, my mommy got a pea soup. It was delicious. Also, here's a joke from ICarly. What's the difference between Roast Beef and Pea Soup? Anyone can ""roast Beef"", but nobody can ""pee Soup""! Ha ha.

The waiters put the napkins on your laps once you sit down, and the bathroom is so fancy!

But now, the bad part is that Picasso has a dress code. They say Business Casual, when my mom called. She spoke with a man, who said that children could go in with shorts and a collared shirt. But when we went there, three waitresses said we had to have long black pants or jeans. We had to wait 10 minutes, while one of the waitresses got me and my bro black pants. She said we could put them over our normal pants, and also said that they might be too big, but when I put them on, they actually fit pretty well. I tucked my shirt in, which is optional, and I looked like a clown!!!! That was pretty ridiculous, and also they forgot my dessert, so we had to wait an extra 10 minutes at the end of dinner. So, yeah, it was pretty ridiculous at some times, and I was pretty ticked off. But otherwise, it was good.",N9Z0QfHEEuV2byyLAopnzg,1,3,1,PyghGWL_CczT0vTOIf5Xuw

A recommendation of a great white and a reasonable price was offered that we all thoroughly enjoyed.

The choice you have is either the pre-fixe (4 course with apps and entree selection choices) menu or the degustation (5 course, entree selection only), and choice of desert for both, so an open mind is necessary. Our party had both and every bite was incredibly delicious and mouth-tingling. We shared tastes, salivating at each others selection.

Two months ago was my second time dining here.  The first was when I was a mere teenager and unaware of degustation menus.  Now as a proclaimed foodie, I'll have to say that this restaurant made me loovee foie gras, pigeon, 30 year old dessert wine, and fine dining even more!

If anything, sitting feet away from the Bellagio fountain and Picasso paintings make the $200/person meal almost worth it!

301519,2010-06-11,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"My meal at Picasso was fantastic but unfortunately not flawless.  The warm and beautiful setting, complete with namesake art, was nonetheless a wonderful high-end splurge.  We took a friend's advice and ordered the wine pairings as well.  The menu followed a traditional route and started off light.  The amuse, a smoked salmon covered cucumber with quail's egg, was one perfect bite.  It was followed by a lobster salad, dressed with Champagne and apple vinaigrette with pink peppercorns.  The vinaigrette literally sparked, incredible!  The wines for all the seafood dishes were crisp whites; a dry Australian Riesling and a Pinot Gris from Alsace.  Although I enjoyed both, neither blew me away.  

The menu then turned for the heavier.  Our next course was the foie gras A-steak (that was more the size of a New York strip!).  The huge, soft and buttery foie was seared on both sides and topped with crushed walnuts and almonds in a sweet port wine sauce.  The foie steak was served with a Sauternes poached pear stuffed with blackberries.  This luxurious and fatty dish was brought to life by the texture of the nuts and sweet pear    and berries.  However, the wine pairing with the foie was the low point of the meal for me.  We were served a Royal Tokaji (a Hungarian, desert-ish wine) that was heavy and syrupy sweet.  The wine may have been excellent by itself, but it was not the perfect counter-point to the foie gras that I would have loved.  

The next dishes were the ""entrées"" of the night.  We chose (from several options) the lamb and the halibut.  Sadly the halibut was dry and a bit salty.  I didn't mind the seasoning, but dry fish is dry fish.  The crispy Serrano ham would have been perfect with a nice moist piece of fish... but dry, dry and dry was just too much.  We expected better.  How could a kitchen that has mastered the scallop and the lobster as perfectly as they had still overcook fish? 

The lamb entree was perfect; tender and juicy, not gamey or grey at all.  Although some fat had to be trimmed away at the table, the fat kept the meat perfectly wrapped up until it was no longer needed.  The lamb's sides were great little accompaniments; both traditional (potatoes au'gratin) and unique (zucchini salad, fresh Israeli salad).  The most amazing part of this course was UNDOUBTEDLY the wine.  The lamb was paired with a Spanish 100% Mourvedre.  This wine was balanced with a dry, minerally bite, ripe fruit and subtle oak.  The most incredible quality of the wine was how the tannins exploded with each sip and made my gums tingle!  Each sip made me marvel at how perfectly the dry tannins were brought to life by the fatty soft lamb.  The wine was unlike any wine I have ever experienced.  The sommelier had more than made up for his earlier choices.                    

The deserts were good, but largely forgettable (home made ice cream, caramels, chocolate cake with frills on, etc.).  

Although the food was very good, the setting added to the experience in some truly awesome ways.  The Bellagio Hotel's water show was front and center because we had ""lake-side"" seats.  Absolutely incredible!  Picasso is also an art gallery that exhibits several original Picasso paintings and ceramics.  It is hard not to sense the art's inspiration on the kitchen-- the food was rustic, traditional and refined but also curvy, surreal and not all on the same level.",ujCagNL-Miq_wpC6oB7GHw,3,3,4,4oV6UriOUmxgHsAoSR8izA

I have to give kudos to Kelly Moloney, the general manager, for getting us a lakeside table on an evening where it was difficult to obtain (I don't know how you did it, but words can't even begin to describe how awesome that was of you) 

The quality of the food and service we got was top notch. It was if our server and wait staff knew what we wanted even before we did. The personal attention we received made us feel as if we were the only people in the restaurant. If I had to pick a favorite dish, it would be a tie between the Sautéed Medallions of Fallow Deer and the Foie Gras au Torchon.

Reading the Yelp reviews we made sure to get a table near the fountains, but if I were to go again I would request a table on the other side of the service table - the dining was more intimate there.  The fountains are cool, but you can see them from the strip, and during a fine meal they were un-neccessary noise.

Why 3 stars?

While our server was excellent, the service overall felt disorgainized. There were many times that our wine pairing would come out several minutes before the dish (or the option to get wine was only offered after desert was served).  Our personal server had excellent personality and attention, but overall the co-ordination between the front and the back of the house was disjointed and sloppy at this price point.

The wine pairing was the worst I have experienced at this level of dining. Two of the wines served during our meal I can buy at the local Whole Foods for less than $20 a bottle. While the flavors mached the food, the quality did not.  The wine steward should have taken time to understand who we were and serve appropriately (I mentioned that we had a Torrontes when we were on a tasting trip to Mendoza so it did not require as much exclaimation, but this was lost on him). I had to surpress a giggle when he was talking about the paring of Tokaji with Foie Gras (fairly standard if you do not go French). Also, when a pairing with the meal is purchased, it usually includes a pairing with the desert course, We waited for a bit staring at melting ice cream before realizing it would not come out.

- Food is indeed  tasty
- Service is attentive

Cons:
- The place felt... a bit pompous. 
- Take down the artwork, and this place is really only deserving of 1 Michelen star. 
- The food, while well prepared and seasoned, was somewhat lacking character. It felt uninventive and quite frankly, boring. It's all been done before and felt really standard for a restaurant of that caliber.

To sum it up, there are plenty of better restaurants in Vegas to go to if you want to spend that kind of money. It's not that it was bad per se... it just really wasn't all that remarkable.

There was one vegetarian option, and the 'entree' for that and another dish were simply not yummy. That is usually OK for me, because no one ever treats vegetarians well at fine dining. I go with my carnivore partner who likes fine dining on special occasions. I usually have a snack before dinner because sometimes there is so little vegetarian yummyness, and bread gets boring. This place was no exception, except it had the audacity to charge quite a bit more for a not-so-good vegetarian meal. The yummyest thing I had was the one fava bean in my little bowl of soup. I am not belittling that bean, it was scrumptious, I still remember it. But when the highlight of your $150 meal is one fava bean, well... My friend who had pheasant, tuna, lamb, and many other delectables LOVED everything. 

The other issue was that every dessert was alcohol based. I feel in this day and age with some many cultures who don't drink alcohol and so many people in alcoholic recovery, that seemed a bit shallow. I did like my dessert even though it had rum, but not every one could order off the desert menu and everything having alcohol made it obvious why. With friends, probably no big deal, but with a business or other groups it may be. It would have been very simple to have a non-alcohol desert that someone could order without having to bring attention to the fact that alcohol was an issue.

The ambiance was great, a little dark, but great, Our servers were also great, I have to say as good as any other place I have ever been. But I won't be back.",DAukKNGOlkmdWFg0Yc-oIw,1,0,4,40PAHPO6w7P7G-5I5yw9Uw

441981,2013-06-07,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Lovely. For a belovedly low-class town, a seat on the outdoor terrace by the lake is perhaps the classiest seat in Las Vegas. Pictures don't do it justice -- sitting for a 2-hour meal on a warm summer's evening, as the sun sets and the Bellagio fountain lights go on, enjoying dish after dish of exquisitely presented French dishes... I've had equally good food elsewhere, but never in such a mesmerizing setting.

And yet the terrace isn't even as famous as the dining room, which is lined with Picasso's original works. Given the obvious theme of the restaurant I was afraid it would be over-the-top, but the dining room is actually quite restrained and elegant. Some of the paintings might be brightly-colored Cubist pieces, but the decor is otherwise hushed. Although we ate outside for dinner, after the meal we sat at the bar beneath the glow of backlit liquor bottles and a large Picasso portrait. Again, if you were to describe this scene to me on paper I'd find it cheesy and pretentious, yet the experience was anything but.

When we first arrived we were briskly seated on the terrace, right by the water. The wait staff obliged us by taking multiple photos as we waited for our server. We opted first for a couple glasses of red -- she, a Taken 2009 cabernet, and I had an Eola Hills 2010 Oregon pinot noir that was VERY good. $17 per glass, so it's pricey but in keeping with the rest of the menu.  A small gripe was that our server wore a very dirty jacket, with stains and dust up and down both sleeves. No idea what was going on there. Also, it's been commented on by others -- and it does sound like a first-world problem to the nth degree -- but the bread was mediocre and of limited selection, which is disappointing only because of how much you're paying for the meal.

The dishes themselves were delicious. I went with the tasting menu, while my girlfriend ordered soup, asparagus with morels, and short rib from the prix fixe menu. There's only a $10 difference between the two, except the tasting menu adds an extra dish and more unique offerings, so I'd recommend the degustation.

Highlights from the food were the lobster salad, the morels, the U-10 scallop (just one large scallop, but *perfectly* seared, wow), and the short rib. The tasting menu comes also with what's probably the signature dish -- a seared ""steak"" of foie gras, which is literally a whole fatty duck liver. It's probably not a good sign when the server places a dish in front of you and says, ""I don't want to tell you how much cholesterol is in this, because your girlfriend would get upset."" It's also probably not a good sign when you're a cardiologist and the server says this to you. As for the foie gras itself, it's as decadent as it sounds -- far too rich for my taste, but incredibly tasty and well-prepared if foie is what you like.

Dessert was wonderful, and also the most artfully presented of all the courses. My girlfriend ordered the pears poached in chai, with a side of ginger ice cream. This dessert is GREAT, and I would recommend it highly. We also overheard the couple at the next table saying that the blackberry cheesecake is delicious. I had chocolate passion fruit cremeaux, paired with butter rum ice cream. I've never had anything quite like it: a bite at first tastes like passion fruit but then finishes like chocolate. Also good, but not as good as the poached pear.

Finally, it's worth repeating just how spectacular a sight it is to be right next to the fountains at nightfall. Paris and the Cosmo lit in the back, with a different water show every 15 minutes. We were lucky that it wasn't especially windy, so we only had to protect our food from the spray once or twice. But even if it were more breezy, I'd do it all over again. And for about $150 per person (before tax and tip), while it's certainly expensive yet appropriate, I think, for the entire experience that you're paying for. Absolutely unforgettable.

**As an added bonus, Chef Julian Serrano visited our table before our meal and took pictures with us. Then, as we were enjoying a drink afterwards, he came up to the bar and chatted with us for a good 15 minutes about the food scene in San Francisco (he trained at Masa's) and the differences between seafood in Las Vegas (shipped directly from the East Coast overnight) and the West Coast proper (crappy seafood).

The dining room at Picasso is decorated with Picasso's art work and opens onto a balcony that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  If you go for dinner, you have two menu choices.  The degustation menu consists of 3 appetizers, an entrée and dessert ($125) and the prix fixe menu, which includes 2 appetizers, an entrée and a dessert ($115).  Each menu offers a few options to choose from in each category and also comes with a wine pairing option for additional money. The restaurant also has a great wine selection of different full and half bottles as well as wines by the glass.  We opted for the degustation menu and started off with a Sazerac ($15) and a Negroni ($15) which were strong and served straight up.

Bread service: They offer three different types of bread (French baguette was my favorite) and come around often and throughout the entire meal service (unlike other unnamed French restaurants on the strip that brag about their bread cart but you see it only once for the entire dinner).

Maine lobster salad:  The lobster was fresh and paired well with the fruit in a light vinaigrette dressing. The portion is a little on the small side but it is a great start to the meal.

Pan seared scallop: A perfectly cooked scallop on a bed of finely whipped mashed potatoes.  I would have been happy just to have more of this plate for the rest of the meal; it was that good. 

Sautéed steak of Foie Gras:  What more is there to say? It was unctuous and savory and contrasted well against a sweet rhubarb jam.  It is a fantastic dish.

Roasted Colorado lamb medallion: I was afraid to order this as many places serve lamb far too rare for my taste.  The waiter told me not to worry as they will cook it exactly as I liked it and, sure enough, they did. It was medium, pink and melt in your mouth delicious.  My friend opted for the halibut filet which was moist and perfectly cooked.

Citrus bombe and Hazelnut Joconde:  The desserts seemed to be the weakest link in the dinner service.  The taste of my citrus bombe was very reminiscent of an orange cream popsicle.  While not bad tasting, it was somewhat of a let-down. The joconde cake was moist and went will with the ice cream; a better dessert than the bombe.  They also bring out the customary plate of five small mignardises.

The service from start to finish was top notch.  As a final closing touch, when you leave, they hand you small complimentary boxes of baked treats to take home.  All the way around, from taste to service to atmosphere, Picasso is a wonderful fine-dining experience. It clearly stands far above the experiences we have had at some of the other more well-known French restaurants in Vegas. It is my top choice for fine French dining on the strip.",fzGcwCzSOv_1rLRg89BvRg,4,0,5,ZwwReJFwK6VMpoAoaA6-uA

We made early reservations.  When we arrived, we were allowed to view the collection of works by the artist and actually took a few photos.(What? I'm a tourist.)  We were given a choice of sitting indoors or out.  We decided to sit inside, but still had a great view of the fountains.  ' best of both worlds.

It seems the menu doesn't change much.  If you have something good, why mess with it?  I will say that after the amuse bouche and next course were served, I thought I might need something to snack on later.  They were both exquisitely plated, subtle yet rich, and....small. But I was wrong.  Everything was perfect.  By the time we left the restaurant, we were both satiated on every level (No, we didn't have sex, but I think my mouth had multiple orgasms.)  

Service was excellent.  Our waiter, Robert was personable yet professional.  He was knowledgeable and his recommendations were spot on.  If our tastes had been different that night, I am confident Robert would have called it right.  I feel the same about our sommelier although he spoke a little too softly, at times.

468664,2009-04-01,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn has some noteworthy accomplishments to his name, perhaps none more so than luring Julian Serrano away from Masa's in San Francisco. 

With two-star Michelin recipient Coi still etched in my hypothalamus, Picasso had to follow one of San Francisco's best. Located in the Bellagio, Picasso's ambiance did not disappoint. Eleven Picasso paintings - exceeding over $100 million - adorn the walls; additionally, we were seated near a window with an eye-level perspective of the ""lake.""

The amuse was a salmon-marscapone wrap, a cucumber-mint salad, quail egg with osetra, and a corn soup. The silky smooth raw salmon with the cold cucumber was a refreshing bite after the soup.

The tasting menu's first course was a lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette, tomato, cantaloupe, and celery. After overcooked lobster at Mesa Grill, I savored the tender chunks of decadent crustacean.

Next came the scallop with pomme purée, and a jus. In essence, this dish involved two items: a scallop and a potato. Such straightforward simplicity necessitates extraordinary execution. I enjoyed it all - the crisp potato chip, the creamy pomme purée, and the just slightly warmed through scallop.

The third course was foie gras, honey-Muscat poached pear, crushed almond, brioche, crème fraîche gastrique. The foie gras needs no elaboration beyond saying that it was pure opulence. As surreptitious as Goldman Sachs receiving $13 billion as part of the initial AIG bailout, a piece of brioche soaked up all of the fatty drippings. I am wont to see citrus and liver; in this dish, however, I can chalk up the pear as yet another fruit and foie permutation. The toothsome almonds sufficiently lightened the dish and contributed a needed textural counterpoint.

The tasting menu's main courses were not nearly as exciting as the prix fixe, so I chose the squab with asparagus, carrot, wild rice risotto, and a wild game jus. After the fusillade of meat and fish Mesa Grill piled in front of us, it was a welcome adjustment to see a more reasonable meat to vegetable ratio. The quickly seared pigeon left the breasts a lusciously mouthwatering crimson. To the touch, it felt like a pudgy cheek. A cherry note could be detected in the jus, obviating any possibility for the squab to be too salty. Wild rice takes forever to cook, so I appreciate the laborious dedication the kitchen put forth just for an accoutrement. The copious amount of parmesan made the side dish even more inviting.

My dining companion went with the veal chop served with a rosemary potato, and wild mushrooms. The rosemary sprig impregnated the potato's paunch with its herbal fragrance. As for the thick chop, it was more tender than pieces of veal tenderloin that I have tasted. The savory part of our meal could not have ended on a more Elysian note, as the Bellagio water show commenced, bellowing Andrea Bocelli's ""It's Time to Say Goodbye.""

The cheese course featured several cheeses from Spain that I really liked, especially one with a raisin rind. The petite fours and box of pastries were a nice end to the meal. 

Picasso reminds me of a well-engineered roller coaster - to wit, the first three dishes take you up to the top of the steep slope, the next two - foie gras and squab/veal chop - can be considered the exhilarating drop, and finally the ride comes to a smooth and most satisfying end, as the kitchen returns you back to the station, leaving you helplessly yearning for one more go-round.",OQjwZuE5xNJvbNoVl3zcgg,1,1,5,rnW2pxMX0TokPuM6_zd9sA

I've been to a couple of two- and three-star Michelin restaurants, and this restaurant doesn't have the ""wow"" factor that I expected -- so I was kind of disappointed.  First off, service was pretty good, they gave us great seats so we could watch the Bellagio fountain show (definitely make reservations in advance, it pays off.)  But our wine needed some air, and rather than decant, the sommelier just told us to wait 10 minutes before drinking it. That was kind of weird because after we'd pour every glass, we'd stare at it for 10 minutes waiting for the acidity to disappear -- kinda sucked considering it was one of the more expensive bottles of wine.

On to the food.  Our appetizers were great 1) fresh and light maine lobster salad 2) seared scallops with a sauce I licked off the plate 3) seared foie gras (served with rhubarb, which was too crunchy for my taste and I didn't eat.)

The real disappointment was the main course. Here we were, building up to the main course, and we had lamb which was perfectly cooked but had no wow factor to it.  Just well-prepared lamb.  Sauce wasn't amazing, sides were just meh.  Dessert was also just meh too.

As far as Michelin goes, this place is NOT aspiring to be a 3-star Michelin. They don't serve your plates at the same time, they don't bring a champagne cart out, and they served us when one person was in the bathroom. Good service, but no different from other non-rated Michelin restaurants.

Atmosphere - 4:  Upscale, quiet, and very comfortable.  The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  There is also a nice patio area outside if you want a close up fountain encounter.   And of course, if you love Picasso there are numerous originals occupying the walls.

Menu - 4:  Two fixed menu options that offer optional wine pairings at an extra cost.  Not the place to go if you want a wide variety of food choices.  That said, the menu was very well thought out and offered excellent dishes.
 
Service - 4: Big time kudos to the sommelier, he knew his stuff way beyond my ability to even evaluate him...he is crazy good at his job.  He spent a great deal of time covering the wines with us, and his selections for the pairing option were over-the-top good.  He was the highlight of the service experience.  We received good service from the rest of the staff as well.  The main reason I didn't give Picasso 5 stars is because after our meals were finished it took a very long time to get the check, even after we asked for it.

Food - 5:  The meals were fantastic and worthy of their high acclaim.  The deserts were fun and creative.  Presentation was very good, but not overly exciting.  Perhaps we expected more presentation flair because, well it's all about Picasso right?

Wine List - 5:  The wine list was the size of my Dad's old law books (the bigger ones!), and just as heavy too!  Fantastic selection of old world wines.  

Overall - 4:  Picasso is a Five Diamond, 2 Michelin Star restaurant with a reputation as one of the best dining spots in Las Vegas.  In my opinion, sometimes the highly rated, highly acclaimed places also generate highly elevated expectations.  Those expectations in turn can take a lot of the luster off the experience.   I think this was true in our case.  We expected a lot, and while our experience was very, very good, it just didn't quite deliver the bang-for-the-buck we were expecting.

The room is GORGEOUS, with authentic Picassos hanging on the walls. The calming cream colors with blue and wood accents are beautifully balanced, allowing the dining room design to be art in it's own right, but at the same time not taking away from the masterpieces hanging on the wall and most importantly, the food!

We started our degustation menu with the maine lobster salad. It was beautiful in it's simplicity. I have no idea what the chefs did to this lobster, but when I put it in my mouth, I really felt like I was tasting lobster for the first time. The flavor was so...clean. I wish I had a better ""foodie vocabulary"" to describe it, but it was simply clean, fresh and delightful; unlike any other lobster I've ever tasted. 

The Riesling was a nice pairing, the only reason why I'm not calling it great is because my perception of great wine pairings was quickly changed by our third course...more on that later.

Our second course was pan seared scallops with a potato mousseline and veal jus. I honestly wasn't expecting to be a huge fan of this course because the potato mousseline and veal jus sounded way too heavy for the sweet, light flesh of great scallops. After I took my first few bites, I was a convert. When I mentioned my apprehension and then enjoyment of this course to our server, he informed me that it was one of the chef's signatures dishes. Just try it and I think you'll understand why.

Next was the sautéed foie grass with a peach thyme pound cake, almonds and a riesling peach coulis. This dish itself was really good, but the pairing with the Royal Tokaji just blew my mind. I've always enjoyed great wine with great food, and have always understood that great food and wine can enhance each-other, but this was just another level. I can't explain it, it was almost a spiritual experience. The pairing made the foie course so much more amazing, and the foie made the Royal Tokaji almost etherial.

For our entrees I ordered the lamb, while my dining companion order the fillet mignon. Both were really good, although it was hard to appreciate the entrees since we were still ""high"" from our foie-tokaji course. 

We both finished with the chocolate pecan ""bon-bon;"" mainly because I threatened my date that I wouldn't share my dessert. I'm usually a gentlemen, but this sounded so good I knew that if my date stole one bite of this dessert from me it would probably be the beginning of the end for us.

I'm glad I forced her to order her own because I think she enjoyed the dessert more then I did and it could have very well caused an ugly scence if we each didn't have our own.

As I said before the service is very friendly and courteous, not a pretentious ambiance at all, something that I personally really appreciate!

It was our first time to have it prepared in that manner.  The desserts were meticulously personalized with our celebrations written on the plate.

Amuse: potato-leek soup with a quail egg/caviar and smoked salmon skewer.  Soup was creamy, skewer was cute.  Set the stage for an elegant meal.

First course: Maine lobster salad.  I really adore lobster, so this was a favorite.  Tiny morsels of avocado and melon added a fresh complement.

Second course: Pan-seared scallop.  The menu says ""scallops"" but one should not be surprised when a single scallop comes plated on a plouf of potato puree with a splash of veal juices.  

Third course: I substituted sauteed prawns for the foie gras steak.  I generally pass on avian liver, but the shrimp was fairly unremarkable.  I suppose at the end of the day, there are only so many ways to prepare prawns.  Thank goodness for the wine pairing which kept things interesting!

Main course: Sea bass with asparagus.  Some of the most light and flaky fish I've ever had.  Small portion size, but extremely enjoyable.

Dessert: Chocolate truffle beignets.  The peanut butter ice cream was a tad too salty for my taste, but the chocolate beignets were outstanding.  The warm chocolate center was a pleasant contrast to the crispy fried casings.

Petite Fours: Arrived on a tray, but went untouched by our party.

Unfortunately, the food and the experience fell far below our expectations, especially when compared to a truly remarkable dinner the night before at Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier. 

To start with, when we arrived for our reserved holiday dinner, we were told that the restaurant was running behind schedule and that there would be a 30-minute delay in seating us. We had planned the evening in advance and had purchased show tickets, so it was annoying to have to choose between missing a holiday dinner or being late to a show. 

Nor were we offered a complimentary beverage or called when the seating became available. We simply came back in half an hour and were escorted to our seats, for a rushed and unimpressive dinner session. With exception of two dishes (tuna tartare and fois gras), the food was bland and uninspiring, though pretty to look at. The main course of prime filet mignon arrived with tepid mashed potatoes and cold mess of sautéed wild mushrooms which were supposed to top the steak. We were not assisted by a sommelier who would help us pair the wine with our meal, as in other restaurants. The entire experience lasted under an hour, and we felt rushed and ignored. For a hefty price tag of over $600, the entire experience was regrettable. We've had better dining under $40/plate at home.

After 25+ years of visiting Las Vegas on a very regular basis, my only regret is that I had not visited Picasso before in it's 20 year history. The mistake I made (don't make this same mistake) is to assume it was just another pretentious Las Vegas restaurant that you had to take the time to dress up for, only to be disappointed by the service or fancy 1 bite food with an explosion of flavor that dissipates as quick as it came around. (Yes, I'm referring to Joel Robuchon) Unlike, Joel Robuchon which may be on a lot of  peoples bucket list, but once visited, I haven't met too many people who want to make it part of their regular trip itinerary. Picasso will be a regular part of my trip itinerary for my frequent trips! My only regret is that I've missed out on Picasso for the last 20 years assuming it was just another pretentious restaurant.

We frequent Chef Julian Serrano's other restaurants every time we are in Vegas, Julian Serrano Tapas at Aria and Lago at Bellagio, they are regular stops when we are in town, typically for lunch. We met Chef Julian briefly a couple months ago at Bon Appetit event in Vegas, several weeks later while at his restaurant at the Aria he recognized us and came out to say hi. At that point I decided my next trip I would make the effort to bring dress clothes and try Picasso (I'm typically all about being very casual in Vegas and don't bring any dress clothes) Now I will be packing dinner dress attire every trip just so I can have dinner at Picasso every trip! 

Enough about me and hating pretentious food and dressing up, but I enjoy Vegas quite often... just so that I can dress down and have a casual fun time.

About Picasso itself, you obviously already know it's adorned with original Picasso's but it's done in a very classy yet comfortable fashion (again, I can't over use the word... the decor itself is done in an elegant fashion that isn't pretentious). We were greeted warmly and professionally (I find a lot of higher end restaurants train they're staff to treat guests as if this is the only time they will see them, because this may be only a special occasion dinner, in doing so the staff tends to prejudge their guests sometimes coming off as rude and yes pretentious!) Here we were treated like guests at a friends home, the entire staff was warm and friendly, close by to anticipate and attend to any need or question you may have, yet not hovering over you as to listen into a private conversation. There was attention to detail to the service at all levels from the Wait Staff to the Sommelier, they didn't feel the need to explain every detail of what was on your plate, (the food was so good it really spoke for itself and didn't require a 10 minute story for every course, to justify it's price) Yet, they eagerly anticipated and responded to any questions or comments the guests may have had. We chose the premium wine pairing with our meal, the Sommelier explained each wine without feeling the need to have to bore us with his infinite wine knowledge,  yet if you toss out a few questions he knew the answers, my kind of Somm!

I'm not a food critic so I'm not going to tell you about all the nuisances of the food, I will tell you that we enjoyed every course! There wasn't one course that didn't wow us and surprise us. If you are expecting a fake egg that isn't really an egg but instead explodes in your mouth with taste of saffron on lilac, this isn't the place for you. If you however love a quail that tastes like a quail but yet is probably the best damn quail that you ever had, this is your place. If you enjoy white asparagus cooked to perfection with a sauce that amplifies it's natural flavor as opposed to drowning with competing flavor profiles, this is your place! My wife doesn't like raw oysters, I myself don't like cooked oysters a conundrum in most cases, not at Picasso, Chef Julians poached oysters was a happy compromise for both of us. That's the beauty of a great Chef and Restaurant, when 2 people with competing pallets eat the same dish and both love it!

The Chef lets the natural ingredients speak for themselves and makes the flavors truly shine and cooks them to perfection in ways you can not find in to many restaurants.

After 25+ years of visiting Vegas and only going to the more pretentious restaurants when I was already packing dress attire and dinner jacket for a business meeting, only to then be disappointed by most, I will now be packing a dinner jacket for every trip as I plan on making Picasso part of my regular itinerary! This speaks volumes as I have never felt the need to do so in my past 25 years of visiting fine dining in Vegas.

Chef Julian, I'm sorry I had never frequented Picasso in the last 20 years, rest assured I will make up for that in the next 20!",xN0q6_AWw-Qm5Pbv44UOeg,0,0,5,UJLEM8UfFaNXMEDPS95frQ

We all had the prix-fixe menu (115/p) and the wine pairing that came with it (60 USD aprox p/p), where you get half a glass of a different wine each course.

906608,2012-01-14,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"The BEST restaurant I have tried in Vegas so far. (And I've been to many).

I booked during CES week a month in advance - booking early is a must for anyone attending CES. I read a lot of great reviews in Yelp, and they are all correct. 

Amazing food!

First, location is not that easy to find. Walk on the shopping side of Bellagio, and it's downstairs from the shopping center (near Giorgio Armani). There's a tiny little free-standing sign that is easily missed, in all the colors of Vegas. 

We had 6 people at the table. They first served us amuse bouche. Most reviewers loved the amuse bouche, and I can't more agree. We had a celery soup and deep fried seafood croquette. It was perfectly paired together.

Each of us tried either the Menu Degustation or Prix Fixe meal. I had the Prix Fixe.

Starter = Butternut Squash soup. Basic butternut squash soup - nothing special, but butternut squash never really is.

Main Course = I ordered the Lobster (supplement of $40). Worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY. Large pieces of lobster in a light veggie broth. The lobster was cooked to perfection and was to die for.

Dessert = You get any choice from the dessert menu. I had th key-lime pie with the rum ice-cream. Delish! You can tell the key lime was from REAL limes, and you can taste the rum in the ice-cream.

They also served us several trays of petite desserts to go with our coffee.  Each one you can tell was hand-made.

Why only 4 stars? The service was lacking. The bread server didn't bring my bread as requested (bread is mediocre - but ask for the olive oil with the bread. Quality olive oil.)

Our main server was excellent. One of my wine glasses got stains on it (from me), and the server got me a new glass. He even got me ANOTHER new glass of red wine to try myself, as he thought it was his fault.

At end of evening, the hosts (I only saw Men at Picasso), gave all the women a box of butterfly cookies with cinnamon to take home. Beautifully boxed to end a beautiful evening.",NDBTa4ZR_5wZO9HVV86nYw,1,0,4,EbbZYHbGjlZgTZ0Nq2d6wQ

Later in the meal though, I realized that it was a $150 meal so then the price was actually a little on the higher end. 

My husband and I look very young which I think is part of why we always get subpar service, but when my husband's ""medium rare"" steak came out medium well, they were quick at accommodating the change.

926076,2012-09-05,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"An exquisite dining experience with a menu flow that will elevate your taste buds higher than the Bellagio fountains right beside your table.  Picasso was highly recommended restaurant by my 2nd cousin who was a past sous chef at this Julian Serrano establishment along with a fellow foodie with an extensive dining resume.  The dining experience is nothing short of extraordinary from the precisely cooked proteins to the breath taking atmosphere.

I have an intrinsic desire to customize my dining experience when I dine out.  From basic culinary derivatives to more advanced, I like to change things up and try new things.  The wait service at Piccasso is very accommodating with my custom order.  I went with the Menu Degustation as a base and added selections that appeals to my appetite from the Prix Fixe.  I came up with the Maine Lobster Salad, Poached Oysters, Pan Seared U10  Scallops, Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras, Roasted Milk-Fed Veal Chop, and Summer Sorbet Selection.  

I paired the Lobster Salad, Oysters, and Scallops with a nice Pinot Grigio that was refreshing and highlighted the outstanding nature of the seafood introductory trio.   

Maine Lobster Salad was great on a warm gentle summer night with it's refreshing culmination of melons, succulent lobster pieces, small peppercorns, and heirloom sweet tomatoes.  The apple champagne vinaigrette was well made and really tied all the salad components together.  

Poached Oysters were absolutely phenomenal.  Perfectly prepared and poached in a sweet vermouth that was not overpowering as one may believe prior to throwing them back.  It beats vinegar.  A light squeeze of lemon and the Osetra caviar bits were an excellent touch that really puts these oysters on a higher echelon.    

Pan Seared Day Boat U10 Scallops were immaculately cooked to perfection.  Very impressed.  While U10 Scallops are one of my favorite seafood proteins to cook at home, Julian Serrano's team did a great job of perfectly cooking it which really puts my culinary skills to shame.  The Jus de Veau and Potato Mousseline were confirmation of Michelin star quality potato preparation.  The thinly sliced potato chip was an excellent crunchy parallel with the single scallop that were succulent juicy and seasoned just right.  

Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras was one of the best Foie Gras I've had.  So decadent and eye lid closing pleasurable, it could be the convincing evidence to repeal California's ridiculous Foie Gras ban.  The dry crunchy almonds went nice with the Foie Gras steak as the grease was off set with the dryness of the prime almonds.  Rhubarb Puree and Blood Orange Sauce was reduced and made well not to overwhelm the diner and have the star of the show (Foie Gras) prevail.  The Foie Gras was an excellent cut and sauteed so it melts in your mouth.  The cherries worked very well with the dish and were pitted.  The sweet and savory elements worked well with a crusted bread that soaked up the flavor of the Foie Gras steak.  

The main course of Roasted Milk-Fed Bone-In Veal Chop was highly recommended and I now know why.  The veal chop was a prime cut of only the best part of the calf.  It was perfectly trimmed and roasted in a rosemary + salt and pepper with a good amount of carmelization that encrusted the meat.  This demonstrates the high level of cooking skill because it was roasted at an extremely high temperature with such precision.  A rich au jus reduction sauce was brought out and applied in spoon fulls over the meat.  This added a beautiful flavor to the meat that made it so juicy and burst with flavor on the tongue.  A rosemary mashed potato concoction was a necessary that is a must with amazing beef.  While one was mashed, the other was slow cooked potatoes in whole form that were a bit soggy and under cooked.  Micro-greens were added to the presentation. Passed on the spicy horseradish.

Summer Sorbet Selection Trio.  It was 3 scoops of sorbet with candy pop rocks scattered underneath the sorbets.  The velvet texture of the sorbet and the hard sharp consistency and sweet explosions were very enjoyable to complete the meal.  3 flavors: Grape, Strawberry, and Coconut.  The Grape was the best and really encapsulated grape flavor without being too artificial tasting.  It was outstanding and I highly recommend it.  The Strawberry lacked distinctive flavor.

Amuse: potato croquette with chilled potato leek soup.
Dessert tray: nougat, chocolate truffle, cream puff, and fruit gel.

Atmosphere: It's a trip to dine in the best front & center position of the fountains.  It's another experience watching it closer and on a private deck vs the public area off Las Vegas Blvd.  It was quite a memorable experience watching the fountains cascade and shoot overhead after dinner with good company.  While dining it's great to recreate an Ocean's 11 scene and be mesmerized by Picasso originals.

I going to preface my review by letting you know that I'm a Chef and I will put some of my more detailed comments toward the end of this review.

We dined here at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.
The location is stellar, with beautiful views of the Bellagio Fountains.
The finest service I have received anywhere I have ever dined!
Presentation of the food was simple, elegant and spot on. Nothing too showy, which I appreciated.
My wife, who has a good palate, was thrilled with everything she was served.
We had the Prix Fixe menu with the Wine Pairings and chose different items, so that we could have a wider variety of items to taste.
The only down side that I would comment on, that a regular diner might notice, is that I was served a ""corked"" wine with my entree. After speaking with our waiter, I was surprised to find out that they don't ""sniff"" the wines before serving them. I don't think that this is an unreasonable expectation, when you're paying over $250 a head for dinner.

***CHEF COMMENTS(These are minor criticisms and will NOT BE noticeable to the vast majority of diners.)***
The Amuse Buche was a duck croquet over a smear of Tomato Coulis. The tomato came through a little too much.
I had the Warm Quail Salad paired with an Spanish Rose from Priorat. On the surface I love this pairing. However I found the Rose pulled too many bitter elements from the frisee-heavy salad, which weren't overcome by the fattiness of the quail. The quail was cooked perfectly and once again, presentation was excellent. I was curious as to the origin of the pine nuts used in the dish, since I've run into some ""pine mouth"" inducing pine nuts from China, and although I inquired of the kitchen, I was never given an answer by our waiter. I skipped the nuts to be safe.
My wife had the poached oysters with a Sancerre, which she adored, presented in an ingeniously folded napkin.
I then had the Black Bass paried with an Assyrtiko. The bass, which was cooked beautifully, but had a bit too much salt on the skin. It was served with the Cauliflower Mousseline which was exquisite.
My wife loved her Fois Gras with Huckleberry(Blueberry?) Jam paired with a late harvest Mourvèdre. Initially excited at trying this sweet red, I found that the pairing was far too sweet, and combined with the richness of the fois gras, the small bite was overwhelming to my palate. My wife adored this Bacchanailan combination!
For my entree I had the Wagyu(domestic) Short Rib paired with an Argentinian Malbec. The short rib was wrapped in thinly sliced, baby zucchini. Gorgeous and delicious. Unfortunately this is where I ran into the corked Malbec, which I luckily noticed with a slight sniff and hadn't sipped. They replaced it with a rustic red from Priiorat Spain, that I found too be a little too rough. I tried a sip of the red, an Amarone style also from Argentina, that was paired with my wife's entree, but after the initial sip, it was obviously far too rich for the short rib. 
My wife had the Fallow Deer Medallions, which were very lean and beautifully paired with that red. 
I opted for the Cheese Assortment(additional $14) for my dessert and it was delightful! I only had Pelligrino at that point, since my palate was getting tired. The cheesed were varied and delicious, with a couple being a touch ammoniated. My wife had the Earl Grey Cheesecake with was excellent and again, beautifully presented.
While enjoying our dessert we were presented with a  small assortment of delicious pastries that, although I was already very full, I made a point of sampling.
I was surprised to be presented with the bill, before asking for it. A very American thing to do in a restaurant that leans heavily on being French. Although presented with the bill, I didn't feel as if I was being rushed out and I noticed a number of other diners lingering and enjoying each others company and the view of the fountain shows,  which occur every fifteen minutes.
Upon leaving we were given two beautiful boxes with two tiny muffins inside for our breakfast the next morning.  A nice gesture, although the muffins were unexceptional.
***ONCE AGAIN***** These are very minor critics of a spectacular restaurant. If we find ourselves in Las Vegas, we will eat here again. I highly suggest, that if you have the means, to treat yourselves to this experience.",PN34D1RP0aAgVpV7-q5-Gg,0,0,5,nuGcxOzQYz_nbGoZl1E9VQ

Favorite dish of the night was the poached oysters with caviar.  Pacing of the meal was good...and they don't force the whole table to do either the tasting menu or the prix fixe, you can get whatever you want.

wine pairings complimented well, the sommelier gave a very descriptive little speech about each wine before it was poured.  While having coffee at the end of the meal, they let you browse through a little book that has descriptions of the paintings that surround you.  I am sometimes one of ""those"" people who looks at the bottom of plates to see where the come from (I've found ""kirkland"" more than a number of times) but here the dishes are specially made for the restaurant.

1001467,2013-02-11,3,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"A michelin experience of good food, but terrible service, which left me no choice but giving Picasso a two star. 

We had a weekend stay in Vegas and booked a dinner reservation at Picasso on Saturday night before our show in Bellagio. The deco was a bit dark and heavy, but I did like the flower arrangements throughout the restaurant. 

They offered a few menu options. We were mostly interested in the fixed menu and the prix fixe menu. We could select each course our of a few options. We were all satisfied with pretty much all the courses we ordered. Everything was good, I was especially impressed with the foie gras and the pigeon entrees. 

However, the quality food was tainted by the poor quality of service. The lead server (his name might be Jose). He was rather pushy when I was contemplating if we should ordered the sea bass as the third course, even I picked the Turbot for my main course. We ignored the initial rudeness. 

When finished all our course and ready to ordered dessert. I decided to skip dessert, but  other guests in my diner party did. Then Jose (assuming that's his name) brought me a dessert I didn't order. I told him I didn't order dessert, he said he picked this for me, since dessert is included. Then I said had I known the dessert is included, I'd wished he could have communicated that information to me so that at least I could pick one I liked or my friends liked. 

He got very angry and impatient. He said ""do you want to change the dessert"" with a very condescending tone. ""It'd take 15 minutes"".  I told him not to bother. 

Besides the unpleasant scenarios with this particular waiter. We also noticed other unprofessional service. e.g. waiter at other table dropped the menu on the ground accidentally. Another server of ours made a mistake of swapping the two dishes my friends ordered. 

I was quite surprised that this place has two michelin stars given the service was stunningly terrible. The service staff is obviously not properly trained how to treat customers right. This is possibly the worst service I've had in all the michelin star restaurants I've been to.  They definitely didn't provide me with Picasso level of art in terms of service.",aIGv3Yv82yoBfjvkmKmu4A,4,1,2,d2CHJ2BQ4n4r8oJw3CDC-A

I would have been happy with the poached oysters I had for my appetizer if that was all I was going to eat for the rest of the evening, but the hits kept coming throughout the evening. My husband especially loved his fallow deer. 

The service was first-class all the way. The wait staff were attentive and efficient consistently throughout. Our waiter was very observant, personable and gracious.  There was a small issue with the sommelier forgetting to give my husband a pour of one of the wine flight pairings, but that was quickly remedied with an extra pour of our choice along with a complimentary dessert wine pairing that was not included in the wine flight.

Is it worth it? 

Yes. 
If you enjoy fine art and food, this is the restaurant for you. Upon entering, you see the amazing Picasso's hung on the walls. If you sit by the window you'll have a fantastic view of the Bellagio water show. The patio seating has an even better view of that, but you miss out on seeing the artwork. The restaurant as a whole embodies a piece of art by Picasso. From the backs of the chairs to the designs on the pillars, everything accents the art beautifully. The art itself makes this restaurant worth eating at. However, the food is impeccable and worth every dollar.

Butternut Squash Soup- Tasty and I loved the marshmallows
Kobe Spheres- Fancy meatballs. They were delicious.

However, because we chose outside seating, we got one of the best views possible from any restaurant (Dare I say... one of the best in the world?). I would probably say it was worth the price just from the view alone- we had a front row seat for the Bellagio fountain water show, and eating in that atmosphere, watching the show and taking in the view of Las Vegas is an experience I won't soon be forgetting. 
The food was--- not up to my expectations. Maybe I had really high expectations because of all the 5 star reviews from yelpers and friends. We had the $95/person tasting course, and I have had better food at other restaurants that were less pricey. The fish all tasted a like, and the meat was kind of dry. The oysters, however, were fantastic. As for dessert... too sweet in my opinion.  The wines were waaay over-priced, but I guess that is what you can expect at this kind of ritsy restaurant. 
The service was okay as well. Of course, they never let your water glass reach emptiness, and they bring your food while it is hot. They smile politely and make polite conversation. However, it just felt like they were doing their job (which I am sure they were) and not really too ""genuine"" and warm. 
I am super-happy I got to have this experience though!.. like I said, the view from the outside balcony/courtyard (however they call it) is just delicious :).",LNaElDQPcVCmhNEAKQDTeA,1,1,4,b6yrjfu0ANPBLYPsQFnDqA

I don't like whipped cream or the OC or Will Ferrell, so I sometimes feel very ostracized. This means that when everyone says a restaurant is going to be amazing, I really want it to be amazing. 

And, for the most part, Picasso was. The amuse-bouche (formally known to me as the small amount of free food you get at the beginning of a really fancy meal) was a doll's sized cup of roasted pepper soup, and smoked salmon on the side topped with a tiny bit of tiny caviar. I'm completely obsessed with smoked salmon either way but I'm pretty sure this was high quality. The wine was also good and in general the degustation menu was stunning (though, of course, also doll's sized): lobster salad with truffle-apple-champagne vinaigrette (and I usually hate things with apple besides plain apples) followed by grilled foie gras, then roasted lamb (my choice), and then dessert. 

To me the foie gras was overpowering. Accompanied by a small block of quince and a few miniscule huckleberries, it should have been light and rich at the same time. Usually when I eat foie gras, it's so delicious that I forget all the horror stories about how it's made, but this was so pungent and creamy that I couldn't stop thinking about those little geese being cruelly overfed. 

The lamb I had was quite delicious, though a few of the pieces were overcooked (I ordered it rare). For that step of the menu my boyfriend chose turbot, which was definitely overcooked. It's one thing to slightly overcook red meat, but I think it's basically criminal to overcook nice fish at a very fancy restaurant.

This is going to sound crazy--and fine, it is--but my two main problems were with the bread and the service. The bread was mediocre! It's so easy to get delicious bread and warm it up before you serve it! The quality of this bread fell somewhere between the free bread you get when you buy soup and the bread you can buy for half off at the end of the day. In other words, it wasn't terrible, but it was nowhere near delicious. 

The service was weird. It's like there were all these people running around who worked there but could not see us. They did a great job with the whole ""I see you trying to get my attention but something extremely important is happening six inches behind you and just to your left"" thing. Normally I don't mind this--I love being left alone--but it took us a while to be allowed to order, and all the food took a long time to come, and the only time we really got attention was right before we got our bill. In my paranoid moments I think we got this service b/c we only ordered one glass of wine. 

I'm happy to report that the desserts were delicious. We had the apple whatever beignets everyone talks about, and loved them, and then also this blueberry parfait thing that came with lemon cream and blueberry sorbet and slightly orange-flavored thin cookies. 

I would recommend eating here if someone is taking you out to eat; otherwise, I'd try Sensi instead (also in the Bellagio).",K_ACjLFC19kUAAeUXIRrbw,12,4,3,xtk2ojarXprzXppnRpjQ5w

AMBIANCE:
Very romantic, sophisticated, upscale, and high class. Beautiful paintings hanging on the walls, an immaculate and grand (but not pretentious) interior, and I always love seeing flowers incorporated into table settings.

SERVICE:
Cannot review Picasso without mentioning the impeccable service. The waiters are all very sincere, attentive, and charming and the excellent service enhances the overall experience.

FOOD:
Bf and I both ordered the Prix Fixe Menu with Sommelier's wine pairing. The wine pairings were exceptional and the pairings really heighten the flavors of every dish.

To start off, as if the restaurant itself wasn't displaying enough Picasso artwork, the butter comes out with ""Picasso"" engraved on it. I've been to my fair share of fine dining experiences, and rarely do I see butter that personalized...not just your usual stick/cup/ball of butter, but it makes it hard to eat because you just don't want to touch it...

The rest of the meal can really only be explained in photos as they were all such delectable treats. Started off with the pea soup (lovely texture, rich pea flavor and smooth, just the way I like it and more), then the sautéed ruby red shrimp (a wonderful burst of flavor accentuated by the piquillo pepper vinaigrette), then the sautéed center cut filet of swordfish (perfection taste-wise, but I wish plating was a bit more creative), and finished off with the beggar's purse (a gorgeously plated risotto chocolate chip pudding, coconut macaroon, and banana-passion fruit caramel sorbet). The chocolate fondant was delicious as well, but I definitely preferred the beggar's purse (such a creative dessert!).

Overall, food, wine, and service were all over and beyond my expectations! And it helps that they gave a box of cookies for my birthday...a little something to remember the Picasso experience ;)",1Gyk4Si7zvpA9F0ktmBF6w,4,1,5,yBngxmh1_eE1mkwEci-g8w

They were wonderful choices.  The portions were generous.  Of the four courses, the Quail salad was my favorite.  Four hearty portions of quail pieces and some greens to accompany the dish...it is usually the other way around at other places.  Equally impressive were the Picasso paintings on the wall coupled with the Bellagio water show you can see outside.  But it is pricey.  With wine, it could set you back $150/person.

We both opted for the degustation menu and wine pairings.  Our amuse was delicious and perfectly seasoned, but the first course of Lobster Salad was a bit bland.  Our sommelier, who did an excellent job answering questions and explaining the pairings had said he paired such a dry white with the salad because of the strong acidity in the dressing.  The wine was excellent, but the salad only had a small bit of vinaigrette under the salad with the rest dressed in more of a basic aioli.  There were avocado balls and grape tomato halves that had not been seasoned at all.  The lobster was sweet and tender, but would have benefited from a little salt or acid.
The second course of scallops was dead perfect.  This more than made up for the salad as the scallop had a gorgeous sear outside and a creamy-tender interior.  The accompanying potato mousseline and chip were fantastic.
The foie paired with rhubarb was just right and I chose the halibut for my main selection.    I could eat this dish, with fresh asparagus, over and over.  
Our server was very attentive and had a great personality.
I was pleased that we could select from the full dessert menu to accompany the tasting and they sent us home with some petit fours.

Since we were in a festive mood, we ordered the Menu Dégustation. They also offered a wine pairing and I must admit that every wine paired perfectly with each dish. This should really not come as a surprise given that Picasso boasts an impressive wine menu. 

Our meal consisted of: 
* An amuse bouche of seasonal soup 
* Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette -- the flavors complemented, but did not overpower, the delicate lobster 
* Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau -- the scallops were perfectly cooked 
* Sautéed ""A"" Steak of Foie Gras with Roasted Peaches, Vanilla, Muscat and Crushed Almonds -- the crushed almonds make this dish because they provide a contrasting texture; I actually preferred the taste of this foie gras dish to the one at Restaurant Guy Savoy at Caesars, but that one wins for unique foie gras presentation (see my Yelp of Restaurant Guy Savoy Las Vegas for more detail on that fab meal) 
* Roast Lamb -- the meat was perfectly prepared. They decided to serve a fairly tall piece of lamb on its end for dramatic effect. The server tilted my BF's plate before he set it down and the lamb nearly slid off the plate. I made a joke about it trying to run away and the staff went with the humor. 
* We added the cheese plate and they brought a nice selection
* The desserts were wonderful and this place employs a talented pastry chef. The server caught my reference during dinner that we had a birthday at the table and they had written Happy Birthday in insanely beautiful script in chocolate on the birthday boy's plate with his opera cake. The BF had the apple beggar's purse with calvados and it was lovely. I opted for the molten chocolate cake on our server's recommendation (even though I am SO over molten chocolate cake) and I must admit it was delightful. The center was like a molten truffle. It came with boysenberry ice cream and some poor soul in the kitchen was so kind as to separate out individual segments of fresh boysenberries to adorn my plate. 
* The post dinner truffles and other tiny bites were very good, but no match for the treat cart at Restaurant Guy Savoy.

The atmosphere of this place is utterly beautiful. Be sure to walk around the room and take in all the original Picasso masterpieces. The fresh flowers are gorgeous, especially the display on the large table in the main dining room. 

It's also a hoot to watch the Bellagio fountains spewing outside the restaurant's windows every 15 minutes. Before you leave, step outside on the lakeside patio and catch the fountain show from this vantage point. You really get a sense of how high that water flies into the air.

My wife and I had the pleasure of experiencing the 5-course Degustation Menu at Picasso. It was honestly one of my best dining experiences I had anywhere in the world. If I had to pick highlights, the Sautéed Steak of Foie Gras and Roasted Tournedo Loin of Lamb were the stars. The foie gras was fantastically prepared with a crisp outside and buttery smooth center, perfectly matched with the rhubarb vanilla jam. When our server brought my lamb I jokingly said, ""I don't know how you're going to top the foie gras."" Well, leave it up to them to do just that. The lamb was unbelievable! Tender, flavourful, perfectly prepared. It was the best I had ever eaten. The portions for all the courses were just right and we left feeling very satisfied.

The service was truly excellent! The sommelier suggested a great bottle of wine that went very well with our menu. We never once had to ask for anything from anyone. All of our needs were well-anticipated by the staff.

1217957,2015-04-03,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Presently working in a fine dining restaurant in Boston and being a complete nerd about food, wine and beverage while making my first trip to Las Vegas was the PERFECT opportunity to finally dine at a Michelin-starred restaurant. I had done my research and French/Northern Spanish fusion seemed perfect for my tastes and my love of art especially that of Pablo Picasso only made choosing Picasso all the better.
Note, this restaurant is from the evening of February 12 of this year. I have been a big slacker on writing this review, sorry!
I arrived pretty much directly from the airport a bit tired but excited to begin. I was greeted politely by the maitre'd and taken to my table, which had a slight view of the Belaggio fountain that a lot of guests marvel about in their reviews. It was a little tough to see but I'll admit I didn't come for that. In terms of ambiance and decor, Picasso is on point. Aside from the art, the space was clean, properly lit and run like a ship. There was ample space between tables (admittedly it wasn't very busy at all) and the staff didn't seem to be clustered or bumping into each other (which I've noticed even at higher end establishments and always strikes me as tacky).
I wish i could recall my server's name to commend his work but it's been a while. I will say he was polite, professional, and led a well-paced meal. I order a glass of Fino Sherry as an aperitif and was promptly greeted by the sommelier who handled the pouring. I went ahead with the Dégustation menu and elected to change the first course for poached oysters.
To begin, bread is brought out quickly and three selections were offered, I believe a olive/manchego, bacon focaccia and a more traditional french style roll. I chose two but nibbled at them cautiously as I knew I would not want to fill up before I had started any of the courses. The amuse bouche of smoked salmon, caviar and basically a creamy potato leek soup was a pleasant start.
Being a wine geek and sommelier I had to go for the pairings with the tasting menu. What I really liked about Picasso is that they offered ""premium"" pairings as an optional upgrade. I couldn't help myself and I let somm Michael Schwab take the reins.First up were poached oysters in sweet vermouth with Osetra caviar. Perfectly balanced flavors and the vermouth really added a brilliant secondary component. Paired with the oysters was racy, dry Riesling. For the second course, one of my favorite things in the whole world, I had scallops. These were pleasantly plump and juicy day boat scallops with a perfect sear. Served over top of a lusciously creamy potato mousseline and a Pinot Noir reduction. This is where the wine pairings really took over: Ruinart Brut Rose AND Guigal Condrieu. I was not expecting multiple pairings at any point and talk about prestigious producers to be offering. Each pairing offered a different dimension to the scallop with the Condrieu playing off the elegant creamy textures and the Rosé delivering refreshment with nuanced flavors.
The third course was ""steak"" of foie gras with almonds and rhubarb geleé. The foie itself was prepared perfectly and melted in your mouth. The accompaniments with it however weren't incredibly inspired but nonetheless tasty. A rare Dagueneau Jurancon complimented the sweetness of the dish without overwhelming my palate. The main course was tournedo of Colorado lamb. Full disclosure I'm not super experienced eating lamb and only really started eating nicer cuts of lamb within the past couple of years. The dish was alright albeit tender. The trio of wines to compliment the lamb were the real star. A Burgundy (Morey St. Denis) and two Bordeauxs had me in an almost euphoric state. Talk about pick your poison.
I barely had room for dessert and felt badly about it. However, I ordered the Earl Grey cheesecake which was amazingly presented and balanced in flavors. I wish I had more room at the time!
I have to give my props here to service as the staff here at Picasso really made the meal and provided me with a bit of motivation in my own work across the country Boston. There were some nice subtleties that I've shared with my colleagues. I will say I think the food being simply dropped off by a food runner and not presented/""called"" was a little dissapointing. I think in an establishment with such attention to detail and intricacies in preparation they should be pointed out or at least have the server nearby for questions to be asked. Just a bit of a recommendation as I bet plenty of people who are super interested in the cooking techniques dine here. Hats off to Picasso, Julian Serrano, Mr. Schawb and all of the staff for making for a truly memorable evening. To seal the deal a parting gift of banana muffins for the next morning were presented as I departed.",AIWhiKoBdiOPTAEdOrwrpA,2,0,5,MPBmMiqUPTnakVGae6BozQ
1220905,2018-04-08,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Simply extraordinary. I could use more flowery language but why bother? Picasso speaks for itself, on every level ranging from service, to food, to ambience, even the bathrooms. 

Our solitary issue was that despite making reservations 3 months in advance, having Mlife Gold status, and specifying that it was a special occasion for my girlfriend and I, we were unable to be accommodated on the patio overlooking the Fountains, which was admittedly a factor is choosing Picasso. That said, such was the food and service that I have no issue giving the restaurant 5 stars anyway.

The prix fixe options were more to our liking, so we opted for that with the standard wine pairing. I have no idea what the premium wine pairing would have tasted like, but I'm now curious as even the standard pairing was mind blowing. The quail salad, like every dish we ate, was a work of art in presentation and in taste. I had the poached oysters, and my God, I could have done 4 courses of this alone. The caviar was perfectly complementary, not overpowering at all against the delicate taste of the oysters, and the wine served with it refreshing and crisp. Next dish was the foie gras and ruby red shrimp. Again, there are no words. I find myself with a lack of adjectives to adequately describe how good something as simple as shrimp tasted. My only regret was that before I knew it they were gone (3 shrimp to a course). 

The main dishes were equally spectacular. My deer medallions were tender and not gamey at all, and the caramelized apple was a welcome addition. My girlfriend's wagyu short rib was melt in your mouth, eyes rolling back in your head delicious. 

The only part of dessert that was even slightly( and I do mean slightly) underwhelming was dessert. The pineapple upside down cake was just a touch to the dry side, but nothing worth complaining about. I honestly found it helped settle the stomach after the incredibly rich meal.

Service was also off the charts. Our table was headed by Robert, who was both knowledgeable, funny, and attentive, all while not giving the impression of hovering. Truly world class service from a world class restaurant. He went so far as to escort my girlfriend and I to the patio for photos after I told him our original request couldn't be accommodated. 

For the cherry on top, as many have mentioned, it's hard not to be wowed when you're surrounded by $100 million worth of original Picassos.

***Short Review

Came here for their tasting dinner by myself during Aug '11.
(6-courses @ approx $120, plus a $60 wine pairing).

My dining experience here was a bit of a mixed bag.
Quality of cooking ranges from close to perfection (U-10 scallop) to dismal (Wagyu Fillet Mignon).
Style of cooking is relatively old fashioned.
Some of the food presentation was ostentatiously gaudy.
Wine pairings here were very effective & not to be missed.

Value is reasonable, if you stick to the tasting & pairings alone.
I just wouldn't recommend adding their Wagyu Steak.
It's not very good, and it's just too much food.

Ambiance is very comfortable and not uptight.
I especially enjoyed the Bellagio water shows right outside the restaurant.
Decor, like the cuisine, is also a bit old fashioned.

Service is superb, it's very attentive & personable.
Picasso is very organized and the pacing is consistent.
Sommalier and waiter were very friendly & informative.
There are few places more efficiently run than Picasso.

Detailed review will go into each dish further plus other thoughts on the restaurant.

***Detailed Review

Picasso was really a mixed bag for me.  Going with their tasting menu, some of their first dishes were really great.  Unfortunately things became progressively less impressive as further dishes arrived.  I also feel that, relative to other tasting dinners I've tried, Picasso's cooking somehow feels more old fashioned, as if I've time traveled back to the 1990's.  Having had the chance to visit Pierre Gagnaire's Twist & Joel Robuchon the same week, I did not feel that Picasso was at the same level of creativity or consistency.  

About the food, if you're not used to tasting dinners (and don't mind foie gras), this wouldn't be such a bad place to start.  The flavor's are generally accessible, and the wine pairings are so effective, that I feel most will be able to enjoy.

On the the food;

I started with a pair of amuse bouche dishes, which I thought were good but again, somewhat conservative.  No formal names were given on the menu, so I made them up in my attempt to best describe the dishes.

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4N3sWH8aBaBHWEVm1w3k0A&userid=OWtjsyPKWUu7La7uOyC6Rw

'Leek soup with almonds'.
(Dish rating 75%.)  

Pleasant, delicate, and straightforward flavors that highlight the two ingredients.  temperature slightly chilled.  light and refreshing.  Very good soup.  

'Salmon with egg and caviar'.
(Dish rating 40%.)  

I felt this wasn't memorable.  It tasted almost exactly as mentioned, but with some boiled egg in the center. rolled in.  The salmon is quite delicious, but the caviar is obscured.  Very pedestrian amuse.

I felt this really wasn't a salad in the conventional sense in that there a lot of lobster with a bit of greens on top.  Nonetheless, it was great lighter, refreshing dish.  It was a wonderful way to start after the duo of amuse bouche.  The lobster itself was great.  Chunks of lobster meat is arranged to resemble a cake of sorts.  The lobster is very juicy, and delicate.  Texture wise, it was quite tender for lobster.  It's served with a more chilled temperature, and portion size was generous.  

The condiments are well thought out as well.  The dish is complemented by sweet flavors from some melon.  The  greens were not as generous as I would have preferred, although they do give the dish a more crispy texture.  Red peppercorns, another integral condiment, add wonderful subtly peppery finish.  Like the greens, however, I do wish there were more peppercorns.   In terms of wine parings, I was given a dry citrus-like Reisling, that thankfully wasn't too sweet.  It took an already accomplished dish to another level.  Very good balance of savory, sweet , citrus & spicy flavors.

Times change, and what might be considered progression is actually regression, and alas, Picasso is just one of dozens expensive and glitzy restaurants that help Las Vegas preserve its ""cookie cutter"" onslaught on Capitalism.  This city knows how to wring those dollars from you.  Picasso is sadly a ghost of its former self.

The food was good, with three set menus, each one more expensive than the other one.  Service was excellent, if impersonal, and everything tasted fine. The room was very nice, with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, nothing, and I mean nothing, was special or memorable, from the taste, to the preparation, to the experience.  We were dining in a Disneyesque version of fine dining.  Programmed, practiced and enacted, this kind of dining feels like a computer spat out a plan and action for Picasso.  I don't enjoy this type of corporate eating.  For the $300.00 spent, I left empty, somewhat sad, and wanted to leave Las Vegas behind in my rear view mirror.

When this restaurant was over at the Mirage it was much more cozy and quiet.  You would think by going to a nice, very ""upscale"" restaurant mid week on the earlier side that it would actually be quiet.  It was NOT.  The staff saw that we were visibly uncomfortable where we were seated and graciously offered to move us; a nice touch.  We thought the staff was excellent and the wine pairing superb.  Honestly, the food was good but not really worth the price.  We dine all over the world in the finest restaurants and this one just did not cut it.  Not just because of the noise level (and other patrons were visibly annoyed as well - it was one large table generating the noise and nothing that I noticed was done to curtail it) but the choices on the menu were quite limited (Andre's at the Monte Carlo has a much better menu and wine selection).  The staff was very professional but it could not make up for ambiance.  They need to reconfigure the restaurant into smaller sections and employ noise dampening measures.

The appetizers are more interesting and tastier than the main courses.  The langoustine salad, foie gras and seared scallop were our favorites.

If you go pre-theater, leave enough wiggle room.  When we first arrived, we explained we had a show and needed to get out in enough time to make the show.  We were told no sweat, with some condescension that they do this all the time -- get you to your show.  

But they didn't.  We certainly were among the very few early diners...and then somehow they had to rush the main entree and dessert.  My Alaskan halibut was dry and overcooked.   We were not happy, but what could we do?  We had no choice but to rush so we could make our show.  It was not worth complaining about my tasteless overcooked fish because I couldn't eat another one if I wanted to make my show.  Plus dessert was coming out.  Pistachio and fig.

1271844,2008-04-28,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I begin my Yelp career (this is my first review) with the best restaurant I've ever been to: Picasso at the Bellagio in Vegas.  I was there over two years ago, but the vivid memory is easy to draw from.  Hence, a ten minute stream of conciousness should suffice for an accurate review.

Picasso beat out both French Laundry and Aqua (unofficially numbers two and three) for the top spot on my all-time list.

While everything about my experience was arguably perfect, what stood out was the service and the wine pairing.  I've never seen six courses wedded to fine wines as amazingly as at Picasso.  Each dish was strengthened by a pairing with perfect balance.  The wine complemented the food, and vice versa.  (I'll spare the details as it was a long time ago; I could attempt to reconstruct but that wouldn't effectively tell the story).  This wine pairing is truly unreal; you'd be doing a disservice to yourself by passing it up.  I looked them up just now, and this all makes since; Picasso employs one of the few Master Sommeliers on earth, Robert Smith.  (Currently there are 158 with the title).  Cheers to you Robert.  And our server was incredible.  Very knowledgable, friendly, and without the slightest tinge of arrogance.  I thought our server could be running a fortune 500; he was professional, witty, and very knowledgable.

All this before even mentioning the roughly $65 mm worth of original Picassos overlooking the dining room tables.  I'm curious as to what their insurance policy looks like; I could have easily flung a chunk of Foie Gras at Picasso's ""Self Portrait"" and caused them quite a stir.  Good thing I've graduated from that type of high-chair behavior :-)",5Kr0xS7eiBIJKFLp52P9kQ,0,0,5,eQ3xR3qOSkq0L3K_daZfRg

- Maine Lobster Salad. Apple-champagne vinaigrette. 
Wine pairing: 2009 Koehler-Ruprecht, Riesling Spatlese trocken, Kallstadter Saumagen, Pfalz, Germany pairing.

- Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop. Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau. 
Wine pairing: 2011 Domaines Schlumberger, Pinot Gris, Les Princess Abbes, Alsace, France pairing.
(Love the potato, silky smooth and the scallop was cooked to perfection)

-Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras. Poached Figs, Pistachios and Arugula. 
Wine pairing: 2003 Clarence Dillon Wines, Clarendelle, Amberwine, Monbazillac, South France pairing. 
(This is best Foie Gras I've ever tried. So creamy, silky, and delicious!)

- Roasted Tournedo Loin of Coloardo Lamb. Pisto, Mint Aioli and Tempura Zucchini Flower. 
Wine pairing: 2007 Vina Pedrosa, Reserva, La Navilla, Bodegas Preze Pascuas, Ribera Del Duero, Spain pairing. 
(Very well put together. My expectation for fine lamb has been elevated!)

- Poached pears with ginger ice cream and custard. 

- Mango sorbet with mystery tart. Very good as well.

Overall, outstanding food and service all around.  A must try place for Vegas goers.

1282224,2014-10-26,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I had pretty high hopes for this place and I was a little disappointed. 

This restaurant is beautiful. The location offers a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains. Our party requested The Terrace but, due to a private party that evening we had to be seated inside. They seated us near a window which offered a great view. The place has several of Picasso's works which was really neat to see as I had never seen one prior to my visit. 

The menu is a choice between a prix fix 5 course meal and a semi prix fix 4 course meal where you get to choose your entree and appetizer. I chose the corn chowder, red shrimp dish and the venison.  The chowder was very good but the shrimp was forgettable. The venison was outstanding. I had never had venison before so I decided that a restaurant of this caliber would be a great place to take a risk. I'm glad I did as it was perfectly seasoned.  The waiter warned me that it would be ""gamey"". Having no clue what this meant I opted to order it anyways and I'm still not entirely sure what ""gamey"" means. My dessert (chocolate cake) was pretty good. 

One of my biggest pet peeves while eating out is when a meal isn't timed right. The first few courses came out quickly. Almost too quickly actually and one of my plates was cleared prior to me finishing it. I would guess we had our entrees within 40 minutes of sitting down...which is a pretty quickly paced for a 5 course meal. After dessert, the quick service halted. We waited and waited and waited for the server to come and take our dessert order. After he got the order, again, the plates came quickly. Then we waited several minutes for him to come back by, we asked for the check and waited a few more minutes for it to come. The server was very stiff and a little snooty for my taste. I know that, sometimes in restaurants of this caliber, the servers take their jobs very seriously (as they should) but I prefer someone who is a little more relaxed. 

All in all, the place is stunning and the food was delicious. I would definitely try this restaurant again and hope for a little better service and more appropriate pacing of the meal.",jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw,0,0,3,l8HaC3crXHU1I6vNlpbwaw

1300897,2016-07-22,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"A very delightful meal. 

The service was attentive, a bit cold perhaps, but perfectly proper, and the meal was timed just right. Four courses spread over two hours is the golden standard. 

The food was as expected.  Now, to be fair, the amuse-bouche was a bit bland (we got a vichyssoise with a deep fried cheese stick) and the french baguette not the best.  But the rest of the meal was a symphony of perfect flavors. We both had the pea soup and I'd recommend that to anyone. It was light, minty, and airy, with a minute amount of pig belly fried to perfection.  A great opening to a great meal. Following recommendations from fellow Yelpers, I ordered the shrimp instead of foie gras, and my husband had the latter.  I ended up liking his foie gras more than my shrimp, even though the shrimp was very nice. I felt the liver was prepared perfectly - delicate and bright with perfect, slightly fruity accompaniments.  

I then had the lobster and he had the veal chop. Both were absolutely stunning. The chop was perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious wine reduction sauce and flavorful mushrooms - my eyes quite literally watered when I had a taste: a perfectly European mixture of flavors and textures.  My lobster was probably among the best I've ever had. Now let's talk lobsters. More often than not, chefs go the easy route of serving properly cooked lobster with clarified butter and a variety of classic accompaniments. That's all good. Sometimes, though, chefs get adventurous and prepare their lobsters as dishes and that can become dangerous. With such a delicately flavored meat, lobster is difficult to balance and can easily get lost in other flavors. Not here. My lobster was lobster first, and perfectly textured at that. It was presented in a light corn sauce which flawlessly accented the main ingredient.  At Picasso you never see the lobster shell - they serve the whole lobster, including the claws, already de-shelled.  I was very happy with my choice. 

Onto desserts. I had the poached pear and he had the fondant. Skip the fondant, it was nothing special.  The pear tart was nice and crispy.  Too bad they go for fondant and not a fluffier, lighter soufflé, a beloved French classic.  Sadly, my husband declared the Picasso's staff doesn't know how to prepare a cappuccino.  The same goes for my tea.  It was beautifully served, but also not good - the tea bag designed for a big teapot was placed in a personal pot and that resulted in a bitter, dark cup fill of unnecessary tannins.

On the way out we received two boxes with mini muffins.  The muffins were not very god.  Chocolate pralines would have been a better choice, ore better yet - nothing.

I thought it might help some to know the prices. Prix-Fixe menu was $118 and Menu Dégustation $128.  No other options were available.  Desserts were included.  Hot beverages were priced fairly.

From the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out, the staff made us feel very welcome and made the night very enjoyable.

We started off with the amuse bouche, which was a medallion of foie gras on top of a crostini and a small cup of potato soup topped with some pine nuts.
It was a great start to the meal.

That night there were two prix fixe menus.  The 5 course menu degustation and a 4 course menu. There was also the choice of substituing an appetizer dish with tuna tartare and/or your main course with japanese kobe filet as daily specials.

Since the Kobe was an additional 100 dollars, and me having lost more than that at the tables the night previous, I decided to stick with their other main course offerings.

The first dish was a maine lobster salad with an apple-champagne vinaigrette.  It was very refreshing and light.  Great first dish.

Second was the pan seared sea scallop on a bed of potato mousseline and veal reduction sauce.  This is the best sea scallop I ever had.  Just thinking about this dish makes me hungry.

Third was the seared foie gras. It was very rich and almost just metls in your mouth.

There were two choices for the main course:
Sauteed Filet of Halibut or the Tournedos of Aged Lamb.  I went for the lamb.  

The lamb was served medium rare with red peppers and a heart of artichoke with bernaise sauce.  Lamb was cooked to perfection and the flavors just exploded.  

For dessert there were several choices, but I went with the chocolate fondant with peanut butter ice cream and caramel.

The first course: butternut squash soup for the hubby and lobster salad for me. Both were great. We agreed the meal was off to a great start. The lobster salad ended up being the best dish by the way. 

The next course: big eye tuna and foie gras. 
The tuna tartare lacked flavor , needed some serious pizazz . Foie gras was prepared with a thin crisp wafer and some type of soy sauce with a spoonful of mash potatoes. It wasn't bad. 

Next was the entree: lamb chops and halibut-- big disappointments!

And you can ""upgrade"" certain appetizers or entrees to like lobster or wagyu.  I dunno, seemed kind of tacky to me.  You're already paying at minimum a couple hundred dollars--no need to upsell for another $100 or more.  Just make it a whole different menu selection.

So, we were a group of four, and we all ordered the 4-course set menu.  We all got the foie gras.  It was good.  Not like what you get in France, but tasty enough.  And there was a soup--don't recall exactly what it was.  For the entree, two of us ordered the lamb.  Smallish serving, but ok.  The other two ordered the halibut (what was printed on the menu), but when the actual plate came out, the waiter said that it was sea bass.  And it looked and tasted like sea bass as well.  Not exactly a complaint, but a place like Picasso should run a tighter ship.  You should know your ingredient inventory and print your menus accordingly.

FOOD: We each had the prix fixe meal (4 courses, including dessert). Between two people we had the poached oysters and quail salad for our first course, foie gras and asparagus for the second course, the deer and veal chop for the main course, and molten chocolate cake and the hazelnut opera cake for dessert. Clear standouts were the poached oysters and the deer! The deer is incredible - not gamey in the slightest. To be honest it tasted like the best steak I'd ever had! The accoutrements with the deer were fairly subpar, to be honest, but the meat more than made up for it! Both desserts were also incredible. You're also given an amuse bouche (croquette with soup shooter) and a goodbye gift (banana muffins). 

DRINKS: We opted for cocktails, and over the course of dinner had The Blue Period, The Last Word, and the Bramble. All were excellent! And we were very easily able to order a drink at the bar when we first arrived, and transfer it seamlessly to our table.

This place is supposedly a ""world class"" restaurant.  Its at the Bellagio, it's got a view of the fountains, and there are original Picasso paintings scattered around the restaurant.  So you think, shyte!--this place has to be good, right?  

The Picasso folks forgot one little detail.  If you are gonna charge $500 for a dinner for two, the food should be at least decent.

The food at Picasso lacked the luster and appeal of even a mediocre or average Las Vegas restaurant.  It just didn't pop the way gourmet food usually does.  There is nothing specifically bad for me to point to about the food--it's more like one of those ""you-know-it-when-you-see-it"" type of things--and the dishes here just didn't bring it.  The VERY limited options in the menu didn't help either.

If you ask me, you are better off going a little less ""foofy"" and a little more ""yummy"" and pass on this place.  The Bellagio has several other restaurants that are delicious and much less expensive.",6ra6McVe_7ZT-N3f55nWhw,1,1,2,X9khDTYNMACo9q9W2uVj2w

The paintings, the fountains, the plates, and the food really set the environment for some serious fine dining grubbing (oxymoron kinda, but I think it's fitting here, hehe).

We all did the degustation menu, 2 of us with lamb and the other 2 with fish.  I did the tasting menu last time and really enjoyed it, this was my wife's 2nd time with the degustation menu and she would basically eat it every day if she could.  1st course lobster salad...  a secret star really.  Nice large chunks of lobster, paired well with some melon balls and a nice light dressing.  I think you might end up forgetting about this dish a little because it really just tastes like lobster, but it's the clean and fresh which helps awaken the pallet for the evening.  2nd course Scallop, seared and seasoned perfectly.  I enjoy me some salt and the scallop was seasoned very nicely which actually paired well with the less aggressive jus, nice balance.  3rd course foie gras with chocolate ganache cherries...  ummm....  spectacular.  Fatty, rich foie with slightly tart cherries and mildly sweet chocolate.  Getting a little cherry and chocolate with the foie on each bite is ridiculous.  It's like those flavors belong together, like they shouldn't be without each other or something.  4th course entree...  fish was a black bass with crispy skin in a saffron broth.  The broccoli on the plate was awesome too, but that fish with the broth and the skin, loved it.  I wish they had a bigger portion.  2nd time my wife ordered the lamb, 2nd time she basically devoured it and almost forgot to give me some, lol.  Not gamy at all, eats like a steak with great lamb flavor, and melts in your mouth.  

The dessert is a great way to end the evening, but I think we ordered better last time.  We had the bread pudding and the apples and cinnamon this time.  The bread pudding is a little heavy and not creamy at all, maybe it's just the name that throws me off.  Apples and cinnamon were good and paired with some crepes.  You'll be so full anyways, just want something a little sweet and some coffee to prevent a coma though.  Friends had the chocolate cake (probably should've ordered that) and a shortcake I believe.

Service was great and the meal was nicely paced.  We had some nice half bottles of wine with dinner as we're not big drinkers.  However, that wine list is very intimidating in size.  Luckily, if you are like us and are NOT super connoisseurs and NOT willing to spend more on wine than dinner, the wines by the glass and the small formats lists aren't too large.  

I think the food and the atmosphere really make the place.  It's hard to gauge service at fine dining outside of it being horrible.  Given the price of the meal, anything they do is almost expected, right?  Our table was clean, our water was always full, silverware was clean and replaced with each course, and we were never looking for someone.  The primary server explained the menu and made suggestions, the sommelier came by, and I just really thought more about the food honestly.  Let's just say I didn't notice any service mistakes that would spoil our dinner.  Can't wait to come back again, I love this place...",ZS4mGO7qimbKkjsLK3_Z2g,0,0,5,pF0mI-ISN1RM5GV-m0wyhQ

1460439,2007-12-03,4,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Just awful... mediocre dishes for an over-rated dining experience.

Perhaps this dates me, but if you slightly remember the show ""In Living Color,"" their service gets a big fat... HATED IT!

Read my reviews and you'd know that I've had my fair share of 5-diamond, 4-figure dining experiences for two.  This certainly was no 5-diamond, perhaps a cubic zirconia would be more appropriate.

Why, you ask?  ...Well, overall, there was a lack luster of service.  Aside from Robert Smith, the master sommelier, which seemed to make us feel like he really cared, no one gave us the time of day.  (Definitely not typical of 18-point Gault Millau, 2-star Michelin caliber.)

We had reservations for 6:30, for a party of three, and requested for a lakeview, upon calling.  Instead, we got the closest thing to the door, with the third person facing the entry so all the world could see what he was eating.  l noticed that there were several available tables for the same number seating.  So, I asked the hostess for a different table.  She immediately said, we have nothing available.  (Whaa?  Not even a ""let me go see what I can do"" and pretend to ask the head host.)  So, we asked them to move the third seat to against the entry, which would somewhat enclose our ""eating circle.""

We went for the $110 tasting and $65 per person pairing.  OMG!  From one plate to the next, they were pushy.  This gave us the impression that it wasn't a 5-diamond experience, but a cheap Chinese restaurant that's constantly trying to get you out of the door and pay your bill ASAP. 

One person didn't know what the other was doing, forgetting requests like lime or a sherry with dessert.    If it wasn't for the ""break"" we requested before dessert and stepped out onto the patio for a full fountain show and Cuban cigars, we would have choked.

Lastly, or perhaps, I should have started with this.  I couldn't even believe that they DIDN'T ASK ""Does anyone have any allergies?"" ...which is pretty standard for a restaurant of that gauge.  I had to walk over to our table waiter (yes, I had to walk over because they never seemed to stick around long enough to listen or even noted that you were giving them the eye) and inform him that my boyfriend had a nut allergy.

To cap off this dinner, I inquired with the Bellagio on whom was the current manager.  They informed me that it was Gilles Kolakowski, to which I wrote a letter of my displeasure.  And, much to my dismay, we didn't even get an apology.  In fact, I never heard back from them.
===============================================

Oh, and if I may judged it strictly on the plate, it's still a one star.

First course: The lobster salad was OK, absolutely nothing spectacular.

Second course: The seared scallop was cooked well, but the potato sail was uncomplimentary in flavour... perhaps Chef Serrano placed it there for texture, but it was more distracting in flavour.  ...And, that's not good!

Third course: I admit they do have the best foie gras in Vegas.  But, that's all.

Fourth course: The bass was over cooked, very tough.  And, I can't believe that they served this course in a 5-in tall (plain white) bowl!  The fish had a sauce, but it wasn't soup.  Thoughts like, ""Did they run out of plates?!"" ran through my head.

Fifth course: Ordered ""the custard"" trusting the chef and his staff to redeem themselves.  However, unsurprising, the dish gave all my senses the impression that it was decadent flourless chocolate cake.  Obviously, they gave me the wrong order.

DECADENCE DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR INCOMPETENCE.
Save yourself the few hundred dollars and hit the tables instead.  The hospitality and service is better there, tenfold.

===============================================
Several people tell me that they've gone and had a better experience.  All I have to say to that is... the mark of a good restaurant is consistency.  Food and service should always be top notch, and I didn't find either on my visit.

Also, I read that Robert Smith was nominated by the James Beard Foundation for best sommelier this year.  He didn't win, but perhaps this awful restaurant had something to do with it.... lmao.",VlUnhotMqY6msql_GMyvhg,13,4,1,uoho45vpbgdSS9FQyFsl9w

So far this has been the highlight of my short culinary existence.

We had the Menu Degustation ($123) as it appeared more attractive than the prix fix menu ($113?).  We were handsomely rewarded for it.

We also each had chose the recommended wine pairing (additional $63).  Though pricey, it is an ABSOLUTE MUST.  The sommeliers did a masterful job of pairing the wine.  I have never known how much the right wine can enhance the proper meal, and though expensive, definitely worthwhile.

The first course is the Maine Lobster salad.  A simple small dish with a sweet Apple-Champagne vinaigrette.  The paired wine, a semi-dry German Riesling, matched perfectly with the sweetness of the lobster and had citrus tones to complement the apple vinaigrette.  As a first dish, I had thought that this was the best match of food and wine I had ever tasted.

After the first course, the amuse bouche came out?!  It must have been an error to bring the first course out so early, because we were waiting for our paired wine for a few minutes after the lobster was served.  This was an unusual error, and it was noticed by our sommelier as I heard him making a comment about it.  It did not ruin the meal per se, but otherwise marred a perfectly heavenly experience.

The second course is the Pan Seared Scallop.  Rather than light and refreshing, this dish felt heavier because it was served on a potato mousseline (finely mashed potato) and veal reduction.  It was complimented by a Pinot Gris, which was very oaky in nature, closer to a Chardonnay I felt.  This was my least favorite course, though still delicious, not quite as unique as the other courses.

The Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras came as the 3rd course, which THEN became the best food and wine combination I have ever had.  The foie gras was sauteed perfectly and placed on a mild peach/thyme pound cake, topped with almonds, and served with a riesling peach coulis.  This was served with a Tokaji, a hungarian dessert wine.  The heaviness and creaminess of the foie gras was balanced with crisp almonds and the sweetness of the coulis and the sweet wine.  Each bite takes you to another land, this culinary ecstacy.  I cannot overstate how good this course is.

For the entree course, I selected the Colorado Lamb medium rare. It was served with a pisto (similar to ratatouille, tomato based and heavy in green and red peppers) which I generally would not like, but appreciated it in the setting of this dish.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The wine was a Spanish red.  This was not my favorite, though I have found myself hard to be impressed with red meats and red wine combinations.

At this point, I had asked if the balcony looking out onto the fountains was part of this restaurant.  I had thought about maybe having a couple drinks after the meal was over.  We did not want to sit out there because it was a hot night, but soon after our server came and escorted us outside to have dessert!  What a wonderful view and experience.  The dessert itself while good, was not fabulous.  There was also an assortment of little treats, which seemed to be a showcase of textures rather than flavors.

All in all I am torn between coming back to this fabulous restaurant or exploring new restaurants of similar quality.  This is a must-go once in your life!",3brFb0vmOPx8BWAAQyTK9g,0,1,5,a2Swb80mltT3yPEb9om_0Q

After my first quarter of gradschool, my boyfriend and I took a trip to Vegas to celebrate after finals. While we were here, my boyfriend wanted to try Picasso, since this was on his list of must try Vegas resturants.  We ended up with the prefixed menu because we were on a time crunch due to our tickets to see the Lion King that evening.  

The resturant is very accomodating and very polite.  Our original reservations were for two but we changed it at the last minute because we wanted another friend to come along.  The staff and hosts were very polite - exactly what I expect from a resturant like Picasso.  

While, I loved the service, I wasn't impressed by the drinks.  I honestly feel that it went downhill from the drink.  I had ordered a Cosmo - my standard drink to order - and it was the absolute worst cosmo I've ever had.  The ratio was off and it tasted too sour.  While I thought it was all in my head, my boyfriend and friend both agreed that the drink was way off and didn't even taste good.  

Moving along....

Amuse Bouche consisteted of warm soup (made with a red bell pepper, if I remember correctly) and a small croquette on the side.  The croquette wasn't overly flavorfull and was really good.  

First dish was Poach Oysters with bits of caviar.  The light sauce made the oysters delish.  It was great with a bit of lemon too.  

My main dish was the Sauteed Fliet of Halibut and the boyfriend had the Veal Chops.  I love Halibut but I made the biggest mistake of ordering the Halibut.  Dry and not flavorful and wouldn't recommend anyone ordering the diesh.  The Veal Chops on the other hand were really good.  Tender and moist and wasn't overcooked.  They came with potatoes sauteed mushrooms that went well with the chops.  

There were a few options for dessert and the three of us tried three different types.  We had ordered the chocolate fondant which came with a side of vanilla gelato.  Great taste and ate every bite of it.  To accompany our desserts, they also served little Jellies which topped off the dessert.

However the waiter did not even ask me if I wanted the third option and when I told him I did, he leaned in and asked if I could afford the extra $150! I was in utter shock. Not only was I dressed very nice (not some tourist in shorts and flip flops), but this is Vegas, you never know who has what kind of money. I should have left right there but the view was amazing. The rest of the night the staff bent over backwards for a table full of foreigners who they assumed would be a bigger tipper than me.

I can pan sear a foie gras myself (it's not that hard). We couldn't eat this horrible dish, therefore one less plate in our set menu.  The waiter did not deduct it off our bill either.

Agreed vegan/vegetarians are served vegetables.. but not literally. 

I had no desert options but sorbet! and i was told they couldn't put anything for me as i was a vegan.. there was enough time to to treat  a vegan guest but just put some flavored ice on the plate.

1644313,2013-08-14,12,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Oh my word. I dined here in March 2011 and I do not remember much except for 4 things:

1. Excellent Service
2. Foie Gras
3. Bambi
4. I dropped the most expensive deuce in my life. Ever. 

1.  Where can I begin?  Oh, man.  My sister and I dined here because she wanted to eat at ""somewhere nice,"" to which I happily suggested that we dine at Picasso.  When we arrived to the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by two hostesses and were seated at our table.  Note: It was DARK in here.  I wonder if the dim lighting was a ploy to enhance the appearance of the food, the people around me, or hide the ninjas lurking around the joint.  Our waiter was excellent in taking care of us.  He was at our beck and call and answered any and every question we had for him.  The servers were awesome as well, and well-versed in the food they brought out.  Absolutely bomb diggity excellent.

2.  Yes, I know.  The poor duckies.  As much as I am into advocating for the humane treatment of our fine, feathered friends..I just couldn't resist flying to Vegas to grab a taste.  It's reverse psychology to me.  Here, I'll try it on you.  Don't think about pink elephants.  It's bad, I mean it. Don't!  Oh, but you are!  
Bad example, but whatever.  
My first bite was extremely salty for some reason.  It felt like I had eaten a teaspoon of table salt. What the heck?  It was no biggie, because the second bite was pure fatty bliss.  It was perfectly balanced, floral, musky, meaty and fatty.  I think I lost about a year of my life from eating pure decadence.  My arteries were not happy. 

3.  Get the fallow deer.  I asked my sister, ""what is fallow deer?"" She then told me to Google it.  Wikipedia presented a picture of Bambi to me.  Gosh darn it, Bambi,  why are you so melt-in-your-mouth delicious?  The Bambi medallions were cooked impeccably in a rich, red sauce that was delicately spooned onto my plate, table-side.  What a great presentation.  

4.  After ending my meal with coffee and mignardises, after walking out of the restaurant and riding the escalators up into the casino, after feeling blissful from having dined at a fine establishment, AND after situating myself at a lounge to drink away the night, my stomach decided to expel ALL of the rich food I had the pleasure of having within the last hour.  Thank god the restroom was 10 feet from where I was seated.  Let this show you that the food was incredibly RICH, soo rich that my stomach couldn't bear it. 

That was $200 down the drain.  Literally. 

In any case, I absolutely enjoyed every second here.  We never felt rushed or judged upon.  It was just my sister and I basking in the greatness of good food, service, and company.",3fvZdZGNi_87rm5aq_a80w,4,3,5,xxrjcoT5J7YmLGX2JQet7g

From the decor (authentic Picassos hanging on the walls), to the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, not to mention the exceptionally decadent cuisine and impeccable service, I had a wonderful experience here. My then bf and I did the prix fixe menu and I started with the oysters with caviar. All I can say is that oysters are officially ruined for me. There is no way I could possibly eat them anywhere else now. Simply delicious and fresh! Then it was the lobster roll. This course was alright but still savory. Then came the swordfish, by this point I was full, actually full and my bf finished it for me. It was a hearty steak, prepared beautifully and as melt in your mouth as one can get this meaty fish to be. Finally the dessert. Oh.my.gawd. It was a farm scene, no lie, an actual farm scene, fashioned with lil, completely edible, items you'd see on a farm. A burlap bag filled with spiced apples, a ram with cookie horns, it was whimsical, delightful and it all ended up in my belly. I only wish I was obnoxious enough to take pics but I just couldn't in a Michelin rated restaurant, I just couldn't. The service was perfect and our server chuckled in a completely friendly way when he caught me playing with my dessert ram.

I first had his cuisine at Masa;'s in San Francisco and I was hooked instantly! The menu here at Picasso offers fish as well as Steak, Lamb etc....The Halibut with Asparagas was outstanding and the Hollandaise sauce was the best I have ever tasted & perfectly balanced.

I went to Picasso a long time ago and enjoyed it. Picasso is a longstanding French restaurant in the Bellagio that is known for its million-dollar paintings on the wall, its view of the Bellagio Fountains and its exquisite cuisine from Julian Serrano. While I enjoyed Picasso, I haven't been back because their menu does not change much especially their signature tasting menu, which always features a lobster salad, roasted scallop with potato mousseline, seared foie gras and mains like lamb loin.

Picasso offers a build-your-own 4-course menu, but that too is a mix of always there dishes with just a few seasonal touches. Still, I haven't been in a while so I decided to give them another shot and go the 4-course route this time. My dinner started with an amuse of delicious chilled potato and leek soup garnished with almond slices. The soup was accompanied by a crispy croquette filled with a creamy pheasant center and topped with Serrano ham. Okay bread and butter followed with choices like French baguette and olive bread.

My first course was a warm quail salad, and I loved the quail. The quail breast was juicy and tender with a very appetizing crispy skin. There was also rich quail leg stuffed with foie gras. The garnishes were quite dainty but good and included bitter frisee, crunchy pine nuts, artichokes, and a truffle vinaigrette.

My second course was a foie gras torchon. The foie gras was very creamy and buttery though lacked the strong meaty flavor of excellent foie gras. Luckily, the garnishes were top notch. The foie gras was highlighted with Harry's strawberries and jam--some of the best strawberries around with an unbelievable sweetness. There were also brioche croutons and almonds on the plate.

My main course was a full roasted squab, and it was exceptional. Squab is my favorite protein, and this is one of the best preparations I've ever had. The squab breast was red, juicy, tender, and with a great bounciness to it. The skin was thick, flavorful and crispy. The squab leg was also good and provided a duck confit-like flavor and texture. I really enjoyed the side of blanched asparagus and carrots--simply prepared but memorable. There was also a side of wild rice risotto, which was just okay. I liked how they used a light side given the other heavy items throughout their menu, but this wild rice preparation wasn't really elevated over other wild rice dishes I've had.

My dessert was a warm chocolate fondant, which was satisfying though not remarkable. The cake had a nice contrast between the cake-like exterior and the warm, liquid (but still thick) chocolate center. They used a really dark chocolate (strong bitter notes though some sweet notes too), and this resulted in a kind of dry-like experience (the dry chocolate sable base only added to the dry texture I felt on my palate). It was the kind of rich chocolate experience that would work better as a dessert accompaniment (like a sauce over profiteroles and vanilla ice cream) than the centerpiece of a dessert. This dessert was accompanied by creamy Bailey's and butterscotch ice cream with a noticeable Bailey's flavor.

The dinner ended with decent mignardises and banana chocolate chip muffins to go.

Service was excellent--polished, professional, polite, and friendly. Picasso is the type of restaurant where they know guests are spending a lot to dine there, and the whole staff goes out of their way to make the dining experience as special as possible. Prices are surprisingly reasonable given the exceptional quality Picasso achieves. Picasso is significantly less expensive than Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and even other less notable fine dining and steak-driven restaurants on The Strip.

I've enjoyed both of my dining experiences at Picasso, and it is a perfect fit for Vegas. Vegas is filled with establishments that do not change. Picasso somehow excels at continuing to produce the same dishes year after year without diminishing returns. If you are looking for consistency as well as the type of premium experience you expect to find in Vegas, Picasso is one of your best options.

Located at the beautiful Bellagio Hotel, Picasso's is a high end, Michelin star rated restaurant that has arguably the most romantic outdoor dining patio on the strip. The inside of Picasso is also beautifully decorated. They actually have numerous authentic Picasso paintings hung throughout the main dining room. The patio is located on the edge of Lake Bellagio, which gives the diners stunning views of the Lake Bellagio water fountain show, which runs every 30 minutes. Since we started our meal at dusk, and since the meal itself lasted over two hours, we were able to see the show numerous times. Being able to watch the water fountain show from a front row seat at night was breathtaking. It truly was the most romantic dining experience I've ever had.

Picasso's has two types of menus. The first is a prix fixe that features four courses ($115 per). The second is a degustation menu that features five courses ($125 per). Since both menus offered different dishes, my wife and I decided to order one of each so we could try many of the dishes offered. Besides what you order, you also receive bread (four types to choose from), Amuse Bouche (before dinner) and Petit Fours and Truffles (after dessert). This is all we ate that magical evening;

Crème of Butternut Squash Soup W/ Amaretto Marshmallows & Mushroom Duxelles

Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras W/ Roasted Almonds & Rhubarb Puree

We each ordered a tasty martini to start the evening but I can't recall what they were made with. Sorry.  

Because this review is already running long, I'll spare you detailed descriptions of each dish. I'll just tell you that everything we ate at Picasso's was exquisite, just as Kent D. said it would be. My meal at Picasso's definitely rates in my top five favorite meals of all time.

The service at Picasso's was top notch. Our silverware was exchanged with every new dish, our napkins were folded for us whenever we got up from the table, crumbs were removed from our table after almost every dish and the servers even offered to take our pictures in front of the fountain show. 

As we were leaving Picasso, the hostess handed both my wife and I a small box with the restaurants name written on it. Inside was two individually wrapped banana chocolate chip muffins. I've never been to a restaurant that gives you a gift after dining with them. I thought that was a nice touch. 

It's no shock that Picasso's has been awarded two Michelin stars two years in a row. It's a phenomenal restaurant with exquisite food and a breathtaking view. 
If you're looking to impress that someone special in your life or are looking for a restaurant to celebrate a special occasion then look no further than Picasso.",YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg,17,15,5,2URzylFntAVIql4Rjw-1VA

I am vegetarian so I ordered the five course vegetarian menu for $143. The menu was not printed out, and the waiter had to spell it out for me. There you go, for a first impression. The vegetables had no flavor and were not fresh. Not to mention the third course was a cold ravioli soup with asparagus, quiet an old dish, again no flavor. 

My mom ordered the veal dish- medium well. It came out all bloody and gross and she did not even eat it. Ended up going home with no dinner.

This is the 1st Michelin star restaurant I dined in and overall it was a very memorable and delighetful experience. 

I ordered from the Degustation menu that has 5 courses and costs $128. It started off with a very refreshing lobster salad and then followed by a large diver scallop. The scallop was cooked to perfection, very tender and not over cooked. Since we don't eat foie gras (concerned about animal welfare), we picked an alternative oyster dish. The oysters were also cooked to perfection with the right amount of mild creamy sauces, and they were hands down the best oysters I had ever had in my life. There was also a very good selection of dessert. I chose the chocolate hazelnut cake. It was a very generous portion with the most beautiful display. 

As for the service, it was the best that you will expect. The staff were super attentive but they also respected your privacy. 

Since the restaurant is very close to the Bellagio fountain, it will be a good idea to come at night and be seated next to the window to enjoy the fountain with the dinner.",dOG418RGpFotuTJYWXmpdw,1,1,5,udX2yYDsiQIbvUNaP6_Y7g

1759165,2017-02-21,3,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I was completely swept off my feet by all the details that went into the evening my husband and I had at Julian Serrano's Picasso. 

We arrived for our 5:30 pm reservations. I originally had plans to sit indoors and appreciate the artwork as we dined. When given the option for indoor or outdoor seating, and glancing at the  spectacular balcony view of the Fountains of Bellagio around sunset hour, we did not hesitate to pick the outdoor option. We were seated at the table closest to the fountain and the sight and sound of the powerful and well choreographed fountain shows really added romance and charm to the evening. I glanced over at my husband and wonder if he orchestrated all of this, since it was our belated Valentine's Day dinner. Nope. Picasso was the visionary behind it all. 

I ordered the Menu Degustation and my husband ordered the Prie Fixe so we can try a variety of Julian Serrano's inspirations. I ordered The Blue Period cocktail and I loved it! I loved the inspiration behind the name and the subtle fizz and cucumber flavor. 

""Menu Degustation""

Maine Lobster Salad - Succulent lobster meat with flavorful vinaigrette, and fresh tomatoes, honeydew, and cantaloupe. 

Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop - Tender scallop seared beautifully and paired well with the soft potato mousse layer on the bottom. I took little bites of the scallop at a time to savor the deliciousness. 

Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras - Hands down, the best piece of foie gras I've ever had. Every bite presented an explosion of fatty, savory, and juicy moments in my mouth. I still dream of that piece of foie gras today. 

Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb - Cooked perfectly medium as requested and so tender as I cut into it. I appreciate how the lamb flavor was very subtle and the meat was prepared simple, but so flavorful. The zucchini flower tempura was so delicate and fun to eat. 

""Prie Fixe""

Poached Oysters - My favorite of my husband's choice of dishes. The buttery sauce and caviar was a new fancy way of eating oysters for me. I've also never had oyster poached and it was really good. 

Foie Gras au Torchon - Not as delicious as my piece of foie gras but for some strange reasons, the sweet apple tart really paired well with the foie gras. 

Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer - Our first time having deer and it tasted just like steak but with a little gaminess. Cooked perfectly medium rare as requested.  

Service was impeccable. I personally thought the service that evening tops several Michelin rated restaurants I've dine at, which includes The French Laundry. Our server was exceptional and accommodating. I appreciate the outdoor heaters and how he was so kind to adjust it several times for me. We felt like the service revolved around our dinner where finished plates were taken away, new utensils arrived, and water was refilled (many many many times) all at the right timing. Everywhere I turned on my way to the restroom, there was already someone there opening the door or directing me. The service really made the evening extra special. 

There was one table that was getting a bit loud a one point of their dinner and I liked how our server approached them in a very professional and tactful manner. Usually when I dine out and there happens to be a rowdy table, the servers ignore it, and that affects all the other diners. I like how our server did what needed to be done so everyone else can enjoy their dinner experience. 

Thank you Picasso for a wonderful evening of food pleasing to the eyes and mouth, amazing service, and beautiful scenarios. You were the highlight of my Vegas trip and I truly hope to dine with you again. Maybe next time, we will sit indoors and not only savor the food art, but the actually Picasso art as well.",3JJGEQ6nV3edLA9Aso2mNA,7,5,5,BUejNtgdD_7QGC-wwr7epw

1833029,2018-03-21,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Dined on the patio on a weekday: we tried both the prix fixe & menu dégustation.

Location: Unbeatable! The priceless Picasso's adorning the walls, and the stunning ring-side view of the fountains at Bellagio set the stage for an infinitely memorable evening.

Food: The oysters were poached to perfection and the tuna tartare was wonderfully seasoned. However, we were surprisingly underwhelmed by some courses - the foie gras was a tad too greasy (no pun intended) and the deer left something to be desired as far as flavour. Dessert was delightful. Thumbs up to the petits fours and the elegantly packed muffins!

Service: We were exceedingly grateful that our request for a patio table was honoured. While the maître d' and other staff were incredibly amenable, attentiveness was wanting in some domains, particularly for an establishment of this calibre with two Michelin stars e.g. long-drawn lag before glasses were refilled. Perhaps outdoor seating and the lighting after dusk were contributory factors, but then again, we arrived well before sunset. Something tells me that the outcome of the fabled cutlery-under-the-chair test would not sit well with Michelin inspectors at the time that we visited.

Summary: It was a dream to spend 3+ hours dining with a view - we wound up bagging at least 7 fountain shows. Picasso offers a superb dining experience amid exceptional surroundings, and that in itself lends ample reason to visit (or return).

Ask in advance if you would like to sit next to the window. 

The bread service at this restaurant is unique, a server comes around with a tray of 3 breads to let you choose which ones you want. To my surprise the server came back a second time with more bread which we happily devoured. The raisin bread was our favorite!

Menu Degustation--5 Courses for $128 
0. Amuse bouche--Tasty fried croquette and savory soup

2. Pan Seared U-10 Boat Scallop--Perfectly seared scallops on a bed of mashed potatoes. No complaints about this one. 
3. Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras--The foie gras was lukewarm. If they had heated this more thoroughly this dish would have been good. The poached pear went well with the fatty foie gras. 
4. Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb--Lamb was underseasoned and the vegetable pairing was not good. I thought this would be a tender cut of lamb but I really had to saw through it. 
5. Chocolate Bread Pudding--Interesting take on bread pudding. I really loved the tart passionfruit puree with this. 
6. Warm Chocolate Fondant--The molten chocolate cake had a perfectly gooey center and was  not too sweet. (Each person can choose a different dessert as part of the tasting)

Lastly, my boyfriend really liked the cocktails. These were $16 cocktails but very much worth the price. As we saw later in the trip we paid more for mediocre cocktails at L'Atelier.

It did, in that I learned that foie gras doesn't always have to taste like shoe scrapings, but it really was extraordinarily rich.  It weirdly reminded me of duck fat, actually.  

The decor is fantastic, with the Bellagio fountain shows going off outside the window and the Picassos adorning the walls of the restaurant, it all speaks of this sort of fantastically extravagant lifestyle that I could only have a taste of.  I especially loved the plates and was really tempted to steal some for home.  Somehow.  

The service is phenomenal.  Water was refilled regularly.  There was a delay in one of the courses of our meal, which they comped us for with extra wine for that course, as well as a free sample of an exquisite dessert wine that I would not have had otherwise.  Just really fantastic.

1989377,2010-11-22,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I was really excited to come here, as this would be only my 2nd two-Michelin star restaurant experience to date. Unfortunately, I went away a tad disappointed; I expected a 2-Michelin star restaurant to give me a 5-(Yelp) Star experience.

Food: 4 stars
Service: 2 stars
Decor: 5 stars

First, lemme start off with the decor. It's usually not that important to me, but it's hard to (and you shouldn't) ignore it at Picasso. They have over $100M worth of Picasso originals hanging on the walls, right behind dining tables. Why each piece isn't protected with a glass case is beyond me, but it's really cool.

Now for the food. I opted for the Prix Fixe menu, as opposed to the Menu Degustation. My first course was a carrot and ginger soup with sautéed maine ruby red shrimp. Tasty. My second course was a sautéed filet of salmon with cauliflower mousseline and saffron sauce. Even tastier. The main course was braised short ribs with potato gratin and bleu cheese. I thought the potato gratin was delicious; there was bleu cheese between each layer of potatoes, which made it really enjoyable. For dessert, I opted for the ""oatmeal cookie"", which was a flan, with bits of oatmeal cookie, grape sorbet, and some raisins and grapes. I didn't really enjoy the dessert that much. Overall, the food was good but I've certainly had better at ""lesser"" restaurants (both in price and prestige).

Lastly, the service was way below what you'd expect from a 2-Michelin star restaurant. The servers weren't rude, per se, but they made too many mistakes. After telling our waiter that we'd need only a couple more minutes to decide, he didn't come back to our table for at least another 15 minutes. Twice they served plates to the wrong person at the table; the second time, one of them blamed the waiter (in front of us) for telling him the wrong position at the table. If you're counting, that's 3 strikes right there. Also, when I ordered our 2nd bottle of wine, the server let my friend (the other guy at our table) do the pre-pour taste. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means, but you have to get that right!!!

I may be a little bit picky, but when you're paying steep prices for fine dining, it's expected that a 2-Michelin star restaurant executes every single bit of detail to near-perfection, if not to perfection. You may have 2-Michelin stars, but you're only getting 3 Yelp stars from me (and no, service, food, and decor aren't weighted equally in my book).",MDMcW_LjuhDedSuJ2cB8Rg,2,0,3,eTSeJChPbEgkVA-v15XH2Q
2019764,2015-05-27,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Picasso is hands down one of the best places I have ever dined at. The restaurant is located at the beautiful Bellagio hotel. The set up is romantic and fancy. Picasso paintings are seen throughout the restaurant which makes this place even more unique. 

The food is great and the service is even better. We opted for the pre fix menu and wine pairing. Every time a new pairing is brought out the sommelier takes time to explain the wine in great detail. Found him to be very pleasant and funny - definitely not scripted. The food was amazing. My favorite course was the lamb but my girlfriend loved the foie gras. 

Our waiter was great and was more than happy to take our picture at the end of our meal. Kind of disappointed we didn't get to sit on the outside where you have a view of the Bellagio fountains but there was a private event going on that evening.

The service was also remarkable. Anytime you leave the table for any reason, you get to come back to a nicely refolded table napkin! Talk about attention to detail! The waiters are also very informative and polite in giving you course suggestions and any apparent allergy food warnings. 

And now, finally to the food. It was a total disappointment. yea right!! How could it not be exceptional?!! I ended up getting the Prix Fixe and my other half got the Menu Dégustation. As usual, I forgot all the courses we had, but I know I got the oysters and fallow deer, and he got the scallops and kobe beef. Let me tell you, everything was exquisite and delicious, but the oysters and kobe beef were ambrosial. I couldn't get enough of it! The oysters were not in the slightest bit fishy, they were easily eaten, and they had this wonderful mix of flavors in it. The biggest highlight was the Kobe Beef. Words can't even describe how surreal it tasted. The flavor... the melting in the mouth... *ack* it's giving me chills just thinking delicious wondrous it tasted. The desserts were fantastic too. They also give you a gift when you leave. It's a cute small box with two pieces of dessert for later!

The decor is beautiful, with a great view of the fountains from many of the tables. 

The food is fantastic. I've been to several 2 and 3 star Michelins, and this one deserves its 2 star status. The amuse bouche was very good. The lobster was some of the best lobster I have had (so tender and fresh). The scallop dish was also good. The foie gras was cooked very well, but the accompaniment tasted like apple sauce, and it was not good. I usually opt for some kind of beef dish, but I ordered the Colorado lamb. This was AMAZING. The best lamb I've ever had. Not at all gamey, so flavorful, with a great mint aioli.  My friend and I shared two desserts, the butterscotch cheese cake and pear tart dish and the chocolate bouffant dish. Both were very good. It's hard to impress me with desserts, but these were quite good (slight preference for butterscotch pear dish). You could also opt for a cheese plate for an add-on.  

The service was pretty good, although I didn't love our waiter. The other wait staff were great, but the waiter was a little cold. In a place of this caliber (i.e., a 2 star Michelin), part of the experience is being treated as though you are special. Definitely not with our waiter (and thus, my desire for 4.5 stars).  

They opened the doors late, and made us all stand outside like cattle waiting to get called in (beyond our appt time).   Also, the take home cookies were stale, according to my friend. I didn't even eat one b/c they didn't look appetizing. No point giving out a treat if it isn't good.

2056568,2012-10-21,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Omg. This is the epitome of fine dining. Had the awesome opportunity to eat here for dinner with my boyfriend's ballin family and family friends for Christmas eve. First off, we had a beautiful view of the fountains at Bellagio. We ate dinner in front of dancing waterfalls and music, so it was like dinner and a show. Just absolutely beautiful.

So I've only been here just the one time (I'd be dirt poor otherwise), so I'm not sure what their menu is usually like. We had the prix fixe menu I think, and I remember having to choose between one or another. Both options were around $100 or more per person... So, either way, you know you're gonna get a whoppin meal. Was it a 5 course meal? 6? 7?? Honestly can't remember, but the dishes just kept coming.

We each got a complimentary shot of soup? It came with a small spoonful of salmon, caviar, and half a quail egg? So you eat that spoonful, down the shot, and bask yourself in the beauty that is your sense of taste. The soup was wonderful - creamy, yet light, and flavored in such a way that I don't... know what it is. But I would savor it to its last drop.

My course started off with some oysters topped with some fancy sauce and caviar. Omg. Super smooth. The oyster literally did a slip and slide down my throat, yet somehow leaving a trace of wonderful, clean flavor on my tongue that was just... blissful. I love oysters, and having it that way was amazing.

Uh. At this point, I don't remember what else my meal consisted of. Like I said, dish after dish after dish. And I shared some with my boyfriend, who shared some of his with me, so I got a little mixed up. There was some shrimp, some steak, some chicken, some scallop, foie gras... and I can't recall them in order but they were all FANTASTIC. This wasn't just regular food. It was seriously fine as hell.

Anyway, I would recommend this for sure to anyone and everyone (who's willing to drop some serious bucks).",5AJRqMc0y4yYW-YEz3FEuQ,0,0,5,Dd7wI5yrlsFErgXN7Hcpsg

The amuse bouche of potato leek soup and pheasant croquette was a great way to start of the meal, it was warming and a simple taste to warm up the taste buds.  We went with the prix fixe menu.  I started with the poached oysters and my husband got the creme of butternut squash.  The oysters were fresh and large with a little bit of salt and bitterness.  So refreshing and delicious.  The creme on the other hand was smooth, rich and decadent.  

The next course was foie gras au torchon and sauteed filet of black bass.  The foie gras was very rich as you would expect, so I was glad I had the oysters first.  The port wine reduction was a good balance with the sweet cutting through the richness.  The black bass was even better with crispy skin, soft rish, and a rich saffron sauce.

Finally are main meals were Fallow Deer and Veal Chop.  The deer was by far the best venison I have ever had.  It was so tender and rich, more like eating a very good filet mignon.  There was no gaminess but still unique flavor.  The green apple and zinfandel sauce were a little sweet and a little sour adding complexity to the dish.  The veal chop was quite big and rich throughout.

I opted for the 5-course Menu Degustation which features mostly seafood selections, with the regular wine pairing which is mostly fruity and sweet selections. It was great for someone who doesn't like the taste of alcohol very much like myself, but if you're the kind of wine connoisseur who will live and die by your dry wines, perhaps you should inquire about the reserved pairing / other options.

Only complaint is that the food wasn't nearly as spectacular looking as I'd expect from what used to have 2 Michelin stars.

The guard before the escalator told us that there's no exit downstairs even though we were going to the restaurant (I guess we looked too young?). What a horrible way to start a dinner! The hostess was nice, although we got a bad table even though the place wasn't full. We got carded even though my friend was in his thirties. 

The vegetarian tasting menu was really uninspired. The portions are large per course, but nothing was outstanding and delicious. It was nice and romantic, but there are far better romantic restaurants in Vegas that are far cheaper. The desserts were pretty good though.

All in all, the experience was nice, but the service and the way we were treated definitely left something to be desired. If you are choosing between this and other michelin star places--you should probably go elsewhere instead!",3ooy-f5KRqRHlWhlQQxXbQ,2,1,3,0B1ovw1W2luRkK_IBvWcQg

2280080,2016-06-07,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"This is only my second Yelp review because usually when I'm disappointed, I just suck it up and deal with it, but my experience with Picasso was so bothersome that I had to review. We chose Picasso as our dining destination for June 2, 2016, to celebrate my fiancé's 30th birthday and our wedding as we were getting married the next day in Las Vegas. I am a foodie, go out to eat often and researched Picasso and other restaurants for months. I ended up choosing Picasso and ended up sorely regretting my decision.

When we arrived at 7:40 p.m. we were lead to our table and received waters. However, it then took our server 20-25 mins to take our drink orders and 30 mins after we arrived to deliver our drinks, which were delivered with an amuse-bouche. The wine was delicious as was the amuse-bouche. But we then went another 30 mins or so to have our orders taken. After ordering, my wine went empty and we waited and waited and waited for our server to come back around. The server came back around approximately 1.5 hours into our dining experience with my first wine pairing and our first course--the lobster salad. The lobster salad was wonderful, but with how hungry we were by that time we were longing for so much more. My fiancé began to complain to me at this time and I kept telling him to give it a chance because I had been so excited to try Picasso's food. I hoped that things would get better, but they did not. We continued to wait and wait and wait. The waiter came back around approximately 2.5 hours into our dining experience and I finally expressed our concerns regarding the fact that we had literally had two bites to eat in a 2.5 hour period. We ordered the five course tasting menu and seriously wondered how long we would be there and we had 6 other guests in town who we were going to meet up with after dinner. If one course took 2.5 hours, we might be there until midnight. After I expressed concerns regarding the painfully slow service, the waiter immediately came out with our second course...a scallop, but by this time, my fiancé was too frustrated to eat. He did not want me to spend the amount of money this place costs for this type of service. The waiter brought over a manager who was not accommodating at all, did not try to persuade us to stay and instead just charged us for our drinks and let us walk away. We left the restaurant around 10:20pm. From 7:40-10:20 pm, the server literally came to our table less than five times and we received two bites of food to eat. We left hungry and ended up grabbing a burger and fries at one of the fast casual restaurants in the Bellagio.  Picasso ruined my fiancé (now husband's) birthday dinner and our pre-wedding celebration and I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. This is by far the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant and I have no clue how this place has any Michelin stars. The worst part??? I made my reservation with OpenTable and was going to leave a review, but after dining received an OpenTable email saying that I cancelled my reservation!! We certainly did not cancel....we showed up....we waited....and we left hungry and frustrated. I personally think the restaurant cancelled it so we could not leave a review afterwards. If you're looking for a place to go for a special occasion, go anywhere but here because they made us feel anything but special!!",AwHwWmoWVyFP9eahD4s9Gg,5,0,1,JXHhIeB56Os0Tbd6SWG2Yw

The service was good, the first couple of courses were great, however when the main courses arrived, we were very disappointed. My husband's filet was under-seasoned and didn't have a crusty sear and the plating was extremely unappealing. My plate of steamed veggies was under-seasoned and boring. We noticed as we were sort of pushing our dinner around our plates, we were being ignored by our waiter for about 30 minutes. Neither one of us finished our dinner.

He told us we had plenty of time, but 30 min before we had to leave, he realized we didn't have much time left. We barely had time to finish our dessert, but they were nice enough to put it in a box for us to enjoy later (even though it turned mushy and lost its aesthetic value). I had lamb which was good. The foie gras was a little too fatty for me, so I had to eat it with bread. The waiter would come around and offer 3 different types of bread. I'd leave the crust on my bread plate...which looked really gross at such a nice restaurant. BUT if i ate it, I'd be full..and I needed the bread to pair with my foie gras. Eventually I had a plate of bread crust on the corner of my table. I asked one of the waiters for it to be taken away because it displeased my eyes. 

Anyways, back to the food. My cousin ordered kobe beef for an extra $100. He was looking forward to it, but was slightly disappointed. He thought the meat was too fatty...but isn't kobe supposed to be fatty? I don't know. He enjoyed everything else though! 

Service was excellent, as expected at such a restaurant. My cousin has dined at many exquisite restaurants, and he said the service and food here does deserve 5 stars. I, on the other hand, haven't dined at many nice restaurants. So Picasso was a fantastic experience for me.

Since there are so many reviews, I'm just going to go over the hi lights:

1. Foie Gras and sauteed peaches paired with a deliciously sweet Hungarian wine to balance the richness of the FG.  I've usually had FG in something or as a spread. This was a generously portioned piece ""straight up."" Presentation was outstanding. 

2. Scallop on whipped potatoes with veal reduction. I would have thought that the veal reduction would have overpowered the scallop- not so. Scallop was perfectly caramelized and the potatoes melted in your mouth.

3. Dessert - vanilla bean crepes with cream cheese gelato. Presented as crepe ""purses"" ties with cocoa bean over raspberry puree with a chocolate hoop giving the dish a 3D look. 

4. Sommelier and general service:  Sommelier personally explained each wine pairing, answered all questions and selected a diverse and balanced collection to accompany our dishes. Bravo!  Service was attentive and upscale without being intrusive or arrogant. 

I will say that there was only one small issue that we had: There was a lot of lag time between the amuse bouche and our first course. Almost an hour.

Quite simply, Picasso was the best dinner EVER.  Words cannot describe how amazing this dining experience was.  Everything was nearly flawless.  The waiters were knowledgeable and always ready to help and did not display any hint of pretentiousness.  The decor was very classy and well-done (then again if you hung a bunch of Picasso paintings inside a burger joint, it probably wouldn't look too bad either).  The waterfront view was beautiful as well. And the food...oh the food...

Since I don't have the menu on me (and I'm pretty sure they change it regularly anyways), I'm going strictly by my warm and fuzzy memories.  Bear with me here.  

There were three prix fix choices that evening.  I was tempted to go with the black truffle option, but the beatdown the Venetian was giving me that weekend sealed my fate.  I would be going with the more inexpensive option: 

First, came the lobster salad.  It was, as you would expect, visually appealing and quite fresh and delicious.  A good start to the night.

Next came the scallop.  This was the best scallop I have ever had.  It was so simple.  It was a piece of perfectly seared scallop on a bed of potato sauce(think a lighter version of mashed potatoes) and I believe a reduction sauce.   As far as texture was concerned, there was no resistance as you sunk your teeth in the scallop, just pure tender goodness.  

I would also like to point out as the dinner went along, we continued to gorge on the delicious bread they kept serving us.  First, I fell in love with the olive bread.  However, my friend insisted that I should try the french bread.  Sure enough, the french bread was even better!  It was so soft and buttery that we acted like little kids that had just discovered the wonders of butter.

Onto the foie gras: It was, as expected, rich, flavorful, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The sauce in conjunction with foie gras was okay.  There really isn't much to say. 

Finally, we get to the aged lamb.  I didn't know what to expect.  Every course seemed to improve on the next.  Would the buck stop there? As the dish arrived, we saw an impressive, tall piece of lamb.  Upon first bite, my fears were assuaged.  The flavor was perfect (I seem to be using this word a lot) and the meat so unbelievably tender.  On the side, there was a piece of artichoke that went very well with the meat.  Seriously, it could not be any better.

The night ended with dessert, a chocolate fondant cake.  It was very rich (chocolate lovers would love it) and a good way to end a memorable night. 

I have not been doing fine dining for very long, but this was far and away my favorite experience and I would definitely go to Picasso again, and I highly recommend that you do too.",_TsTLX4huabB4mQf0Dx30A,1,0,5,zNwq2Ibbtql54QI7zDF4qg

When you enter the main dining room you are greeting by a table that is entirely covered in a huge floral arrangement - different sizes and shapes of glass vases hold one type of flower each for a stunning rainbow effect. This is one of the best uses of floral arrangements I have ever seen. The restaurant sits facing the fountains of the Bellagio, so every half hour you are treated to an amazing view of the water show through the windows.

The food is elegant and artfully prepared - just what you would expect from fine dining at the Bellagio.  We ordered the Degustation Menu - five courses plus an amuse bouche, petite fours, and gift for the ladies. We also choose to participate in the suggested wine pairing - which was well thought out.  The sommelier did a lovely job of presenting and explaining his choices. 

The Amuse Bouche consisted of a creamy red bell pepper soup and a cheese croquette. Simple, satisfying, and delicious.

The first course was a lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette that was fresh and sweet and light.

Next was a perfectly seared day boat scallop on a smooth potato puree with a thick and rich veal demi glace.

My favorite course: sautéed Foie Gras with pound cake, almonds, and Riesling peach coulis.  The sweetness of the peaches and Riesling paired perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth fattiness of the Foie Gras.  Paired with a glass of Tokaji, this was absolute perfection.

Main course: Roasted loin of lamb with pisto (a mixed vegetable side similar to ratatouille), mint aoili, and fried zucchini blossom.

I am not usually a dessert person, but this rocked my socks off: a ""beggar's purse"" made of phyllo dough filled with chocolate chip risotto pudding, served with a coconut macaroon and banana-passion fruit caramel sorbet. This was dessert perfection for me.

Descend said stairs. Head left. Enter elegantly into a dimly but still well-lit restaurant, Cue service - servers pull out your chairs, constantly, but politely and subtly ask you if you want anything else, replace your napkins with a freshly folded one when you leave for the bathroom, a sommelier for your wines, etc. It was utterly beautiful. We sat right next to the window and were able to watch the beautiful light show throughout our dinner. The art collection truly made the restaurant, with beautiful Picasso painting scattered throughout. The bathrooms were superb - clean, well-lit, lots of towels all carefully rolled up, wonderfully smelling soap and lotion. Just going there is an experience; the food makes it utterly unforgettable. 

Our meals comprised of both pre-set menus - there was the prix fixe menu (which I got) and she got the menu degustation. The MD has 1 more plate than the prix fixe; my wife got the scallop, foie gras, filet mignon, and dessert. My meal was warm quail salad, foie gras au torchon, roasted veal chop, and dessert. As we aren't selfish with each other re: delicious food, we got to try each other's dishes and it was utterly heavenly. The scallop was crispy and tender, with that nice umami sear contrasting with the light  texture of the scallop. She didn't like my foie gras as much as it was served cold and almost as a butter consistency; I thought it was wonderful. Her filet was juicy and meaty and glorious while my veal was unbelievably tender. The dessert were nice little homemade truffle looking things; as compliments of the chef, he wrote ""Congratulations"" because we had called head to reserve a table and said it was our honeymoon. Awesome job chef! He also gave us a nice soup beforehand and the bread (mine was olive studded and hers was French) was excellent, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. My dessert was the peach and hers was the shortcake.

We got 2 sets of libations on the recommendation of the sommelier - I have no recollection what they were, but mine was a dessert wine and it was one of the cheapest. Nevertheless, it was excellent, full-bodied with lots of delicious chocolate and roasted notes and a sweet finish. I would recommend it many times over. My wife got a nice white wine and I have no idea b/c I was too busy watching the fountain show that had just started. 

I'm not one to fuss over presentation - I would rather have delicious food that looked terrible than terrible food that was a feast for the eyes. But the meals here were elegant, classy, and very well made. Sophistication seems to come to mind as an apt description and it was wonderful treat not just for the belly but for the eyes as well. 

All in all, this was one of the best meals that I have ever eaten. Well worth the price and well deserved of the Michelin starts. Fantastic job by the chefs and when I save up again, I'll be back. But that might be a while because you pay for what you eat.

The abstract colored carpet and the waiters with their colorful ties is a little silly, but the restaurant is captivating.  The large painting at the bar is really a nice touch.

Service is definitely there but nothing to write home about.  I was having trouble deciding which main entree to choose, so I asked the waiter what his favorite was.  The answer was, ""depends on your preference.""  Not the exact answer I was looking for, but I'm not about to judge a restaurant soley based off that.  Again, for a michelin star restaurant, there were times I was surprised silverware wasn't being replaced.

The food now.  If I could summarize the food, I would say it's finely crafted, and very very simple.  Each dish has great flavors, and each ingrednient can be easily tasted.  Do not expect to be wowed by innovation or creativity, but be prepared the enjoy each food for what it is in its purest form.  For instance, the poached oysters.  They were topped with a warm vermouth sauce and topped with a little caviar.  Elegant, simple and delicous.  Another example is the veal chop.  The chop itself was slightly seasoned, and the vegetables it was served with were seasoned with rosemary.  There was horseradish on the side for anyone who chose.  Again, nothing out of the ordinary, but well executed.

I would definitely take guests here.  If you're looking for a quiet, quaint evening this is the place to be.

Service was excellent.

We ordered tap water but upon review today, noticed that I was charged for bottled water.
Has starch been nearly eliminated from your offerings? Other than a tablespoon of potato puree that surrounded my scallop, I don't recall any other starch (except the bread and dessert).

The lobster salads were dry.
The scallops were overcooked and dry.
Both servings of foie gras were overcooked. What a waste of good foie gras.
Both servings of halibut were overcooked ( stiff and dry) and exceedingly salty. The asparagus were also very salty.

The sommelier was very informative and accessible. His choice for pairing with the foie gras (2006 Royal Tokaji) however, was off the mark. The wine was shockingly sweet and thus, overpowering. So much so that both servings were left in their glasses.

During conversation after dinner, we learned that nobody during dinner wanted to raise issues in front of our customer.

We had an amazing dining experience when we ate at Picasso 2 years ago. So much so that our customer asked if we could return last night.

The evening would have been flawless had better attention (consistent overcooking) been applied to the preparation of our food.

$750 is an awfully large amount of money to spend on dinner for 3. Everything ought to have been perfect. Last night it wasn't.

Although not necessarily hidden, Picasso is also not as front-and-center as some high-end Vegas eateries.  Although located in the beautiful (some might say ostentatious) Bellagio, you have to descend to the property's lower level to access Picasso.  Once inside, you are welcomed with a simple elegance only a restaurant of this stature could manage.  Seated, your eyes cannot help but be drawn to the *actual* Picasso paintings adoring nearly every wall.  One would be hard pressed to find a museum in North America with as many of the Master's creations.  Anyway, you must draw your attention from the paintings and look at the leather bound menu in front of you.  There are two options: 3 course prix fixe or 5 course tasting menu.  Since I'm not a trust fund baby or a venture capitalist, I opted for the 3 course meal.  Perfectly cooked fois gras and medallions of Fallow deer (otherwise known as venison) were the highlights.  Service was exceptionally professional and efficient, but also friendly and helpful.  

Consistent with the European-centric cuisine, the enormous wine list is heavy on French and Italian wines, although the usual suspects from Napa are well represented. 

Picasso is a quiet sanctuary from the craziness that Vegas can be.  While the ante for culinary supremacy in Vegas may have been raised by Joel Robuchon's utterly exorbitant outpost at the MGM Grand, Picasso is still among the top restaurants in the country and well worth your time and significant expendable income.",dR9OiTIjuzvDdoqjuulKrw,2,1,4,uMnuCedWFNGqZ_UbZkVyCw

2617196,2017-11-28,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Short review: This was by far the most delicious food I have ever put into my mouth. 

Long review: So my boyfriend and his family invited me to fly out to Vegas with them for Thanksgiving. Obviously I said yes, or we wouldn't be here. Anyway, boyfriend decided he wanted to take me out on a nice date, so he googled ""best restaurant in Vegas"", and Picasso popped up. It's at the Bellagio, overlooks the fountains, and has priceless paintings hanging all over the place. This place sounds legit. OH and did I mention he took me to see my childhood idol, Celine, afterward? Talk about a catch.

So anyway, now I'm super stoked for literally the fanciest date I have ever been on in my life (I'm a poor graduate student, I don't get out much). We dress up fancy, play some craps ahead of time, then head to the restaurant. Right off the bat, we are treated like royalty, probably because we looked DAMN good. There was a noticeable difference in service between people who dressed up and people who rolled up in jeans. 

We get seated outside, which is on this little terrace right by the little lake that shoots the fountain show. Talk about GORGEOUS. They even have some heat lamps if you get chilly. We told our server we were trying to make a show, and they had it timed SO PERFECTLY we were out of there at the precise minute we told him we needed to leave. I was super impressed. 

Now onto the food. OH my god, the food. 

First, we choose a nice bottle of champagne. Boyfriend chose the third cheapest so as not to look like the commoners we are, which was still over $100. Oh my gosh. 

We got three options for dinner- the truffle menu, which sounded delicious but was $400 per person. No thank you. Second option was the Prix something, and third was the Prix Fixe, which we got. There was only a $10 difference between the Prix options, which were $130 and $120, respectively. 

Each menu comes with a TON of stuff, though. You get to choose between two or three plates per course, with the exception of dessert, where there is an entire list to choose from. 

Before we got any of our food, we got a surprise ""I'm testing new dishes, have a taste for free"" snack. It was a little mozzarella stick looking thing, but wasn't cheesy, with a little shot glass of soup. OH MY GOD, IT WAS SO GOOD. We also got our choice of four different types of bread, all of which were delicious. 

For our first selection, I had autumn squash soup with crab chunks in it. It came out in a bowl with a little crab cake in the bottom, and the server poured the soup on top. It was delicious. Bae had the quail salad, which was a tiny tuft of grass and like, four quail legs cooked to perfection. Not exactly what I would call a salad, but delicious none the less. 

Second selection, I had the Fois Gras, because I have always heard it was fancy but never had a chance to try it. It was surprisingly delicious, a nice pate of who-knows-what duck bits, served on a crispy toast round. Yum. 

For the main course, I had deer. DEER! It tasted kind of like steak but a little wilder. Delicious. It was especially delicious if you chopped up the apricots that came with it and put them on top. Yummmmm. 

Now dessert... OH dessert... boyfriend had the peanut butter s'mores dish and it was to die for. I had a berry tart that was served with the most delicious earl grey tea ice cream I have ever had. BUT THEN we get ANOTHER surprise plate of snacks, with like, seven bite sized samplers of all sorts of sweet treats. 

The bill came out to about $450, but holy darnation was it worth it. Our after-dinner ""thanks for coming"" treat was a super sweet magnetic box with little muffins in it.",k6bRtog2arWIx40tt7tqvA,0,0,5,IBkjZ9JoostVFHV8OFR4ew

I'm giving 4 stars & not 5 because there was another diner who was allowed in wearing jeans, tee, track jacket and a baseball cap.

From start to finish, you know you're in for an exquisite experience. Picasso has its own escalator bank that leads you away from all the crowds inside the Bellagio, and as you're greeted, you'll walk through their wine display cases. Inside, there's a large, airy room with large, comfy booths and tables that provide enough privacy for groups large and small. And the artwork on the walls are subtly highlighted; while they're not the focal point of the establishment as if you were in a museum, they still provide an elegant backdrop to a lovely dinner. There's even a binder full of backgrounds behind each painting that you can ask to peruse. 

Service is formal and professional, with just enough attention to make sure your needs are met, without being too intrusive. And, of course, the food was the main event. An amuse-bouche pleasingly paired a sampling cream of potato soup with a pheasant croquette, while the next course, Alaskan king crab, helped whet the appetite further. The sauteed ""A"" steak of foie gras was sinfully delightful, while a decent helping of filet mignon was prepared perfectly to order - medium well, in my case. A dessert duo provided a nice ending to a meal that was beautiful both inside and out.

Definitely worth every penny if you're up for a splurge. Also, definitely worthy of 5 Yelp stars, not to mention two Michelin stars the last time such ratings were given for Vegas. And a perfect venue for my 800th review!",bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,4,2,5,nzLwaIJnttxE99Vem7pCVw

Perhaps it was our expectations, looking forward to this reservation more than any other for our long weekend in Vegas, that created a bit of a disappointment.  When we arrived we were seated quickly.  The space is pretty awesome.  Actual Picasso's on the walls!  It even has a view of the bellagio fountains if you pick the right seat.  We did not.  

Unfortunately when we showed up it was not that crowded, most of the tables around us were empty and stayed that way throughout most of our dinner.  We were seated behind this giant buffet type table in the middle of the room.  It had gorgeous flowers but was also the place that had the water bottles for the servers.  Our seats were besides one another, I guess to see the fountain beyond it but they were completely hidden by the flowers.  So we ended up just watching the serving staff.  

We did the tasting menu with the accompanying wine pairing.  The sommelier was extremely friendly, even changing up the wine pairing a bit for us when we told him we preferred red wine.  Honestly ever other staff person besides our actual waiter was polite, professional and friendly.  The food was really good though not exceptional, which is what we had come to expect from Vegas restaurants, particularly at that price point.

Last minute made dinner reservations and I've been  wanting to try this place since I worked in front of Bank Nightclub at Bellagio and passed by this every day at work.

We get there at 930pm and get seated really close to the windows looking out to the Fountains of Bellagio.  It was really nice, but quiet and dim inside the restaurant.  There are also outside patio seating available through reservation.

We opted for the 5 course meal $125 a person and some wine as well.

Before the first course...Amuse-bouche!   We had some kind of shooter that was really creamy and tasty, along with a bite-size piece of salmon, boiled egg, and caviar.

Course 1:  Maine- Lobster Salad - Delicious and ate all the tiny cantaloupe around it.

Course 2:  Seared Scallop with 'potato mousseline (aka mash potatoes lol) in a wine sauce.  Perfectly cooked and ate every bite.  Had to get every drop of the sauce too!

Course 3:  Foie gras! on top of toasted pistachio with deep red cherries.  The cherries sauce as you bit into them paired very well with the foie gras.   The foie gras as a big portion.

Course 4: I had the lamb, my honey had the halibut.  Both delicious.  The lamb came with assorted veggies plated well-artistically.  Halibut was served over asparagus.  Can't go wrong with either dish.  (You can pay $150 more to get authentic Japanese Wagyu/Kobe beef)

Course 5: Desert.  For my birthday the servers surprised me with a chocolate lava cake with ice cream.   The happy birthday message written on the plate was done so beautifully.   They also served another desert (pears with ice cream and panna cotta).

Following this, they served mini candies on a tiny silver dish.  All were great.

The service was top notch, highly attentive.  Our server was very friendly and made light conversation which was nice.  He was nice enough to offer to take our picture with our camera.

As we left, we were given 'parting gifts'.  Boxes with Picasso engraved which opened up and had chocolate muffins inside!

After our short wait we were taken outside .... the menu is two choices of a prefix menu I got the prefix menu on the right side and my best friend got the one on the left so we could try both :) 

To start they brought out a croquet (I think that's what it was) and some potato thing compliments of the chef which was nice the cheese croquet was amazing 

1st I got poached oysters they were delicious I love oysters in general but these were definitely something special , my friend got the lobster salad hands down the best I have EVER had it was just that amazing 

2nd I got the tuna this was probably my least favorite it just didn't stand out to me and was just blah .... but my friend got the foie gras which we both loved it just melted in your mouth super delicious 

3rd was scallop which my friend loved and I loved just as much definitely I will say was almost one of the best scallops I've ever had was cooked perfectly just amazing 

4th I got roast and my best friend got .... I actually forgot what she had I was to occupied with mine lol ... the roast was great the waiter was he one who suggested I get this one and he was correct the meat was tender and just pulled apart so amazing

Of course, I am sure the menus will change depending on the season and availability of the food.

Scallop from Chef's choice menu: the chef's creativity in pairing a strained lamg ragout with fresh scallop was the highlight for me.  

Veal from the tasting menu - best veal I had ever had. It was absolutely amazing. The sauce was complex, the texture of the veal was perfect and the taste was sophisticated which is not a word I would usually describe veal.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  You enter through a beautifully tiled portion of the wine cellar, with some very expensive wines on display.  If you get a window seat, you get one of the best views of the Bellagio fountain.  And, of course, there are a number of original Picasso pieces on the walls, as well as the Picasso-themed plates and stuff.

Bathroom was a bit of a letdown.  It's pretty much the standard Bellagio public bathroom--nothing particularly special, but certainly classier than the one at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (the other Michelin-starred restaurant in Vegas that I visited).

There's a choice of a 4-course or a 5-course tasting menu.  They were very flexible with us--unlike at many restaurants, the whole table didn't have to order the same menu.  They also let some of us order the 5-course menu, but with a main course from the 4-course.  That was nice of them

Wine pairings are an extra $53 or $63, and a very good deal (given that you're paying $120 for the food).  Robert, our sommelier, gave us very detailed descriptions of all the wines, where they're from, tasting notes, why he chose them to go with our food, etc.  He even went through the trouble of going around our massive table, giving his spiel several times, so that all of us could hear him.  He was most of the reason I gave 5 stars instead of 4.  Note that the wine pairing doesn't cover the dessert.  Although some very sweet wines (Tokaji and Sauternes) came with the foie gras courses for both menus.

The food (I got the lobster salad, scallop, seared foie gras, short rib, and chocolate truffle beignet) was all very, very good.  Not usually a fan of foie gras, but this was perfectly seared, tasted wonderfully of fat and suffering, and went great with the peach compote and the glass of Tokaji Aszu.  The meal also comes with an amuse bouche (croquette and a shot of asparagus soup) and a couple massive trays of mignardises.

Rude.
But it didn't end there. We had decided that we wanted the filet mignon, which costs $100 or so extra. When ordering, our waitor pointed out the additional cost and straight out asked if we could pay for it.

The service was excellent and left very little to be desired, though they were slow to notice when I'd dropped my fork, or when I was finished with a dish. Nothing major.

The food however I felt left a bit to be desired. My husband and I make a point of going to at least two fine dining experiences a year and I felt a bit underwhelmed by the Prix Fixe that is currently available. He ordered the Menu Degustation and had a far better experience. The poached oysters were phenomenal but that is truly the only dish that stood out. The foie gras au torchon was served with blood oranges which succeeded in bringing out the worst flavors in the foie... leaving it gamey. I had the fallow deer as my main, which was again excellent but the pairings on the plate left a great deal to be desired. They had it with caramelized apples and a horrid red cabbage kraut. The apples I found out later were a nod to the fact that the deer had been fed apples on the farm, but I found them too sweet for how mellow the venison was... and the kraut??? WHY? The venison was so delicate and here it was paired with this loud brash side that would have paired better with a sausage or game meat with a robust flavor. It was over powering and I found myself only eating the meat and apples as a dessert. The staff couldn't pick up on the fact that I wasn't enjoying these dishes and didn't realize I was quite done with them until I pointedly asked them to be taken away. 

But like I said my husband's meal was quite a different story. He enjoyed every dish, and what I tried from his plates seemed far better balanced than what I was served. Perhaps I just chose poorly, but for a 10.00 difference in pricing it seems silly that I should have such a markedly different experience. It pains me to see such wonderful ingredients that are marred by their pairings. Better luck next time I suppose.",FAEvvq_cBmR9_yyR41tCBg,1,1,3,3C6ovDj4ZHa5YJl_c_Dv5Q
2807088,2011-11-14,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"After trying Picasso, it was immediately clear why it wasn't given an updated Michelin rating from 2009.  From my experience, there's very little to justify even a single Michelin star for Picasso.  Then again, Vegas has that effect on people, distorting reality so much as to convince the Michelin tasters in 2009 and current diners that this Julian Serrano restaurant actually deserved two Michelin stars.

First of all, I don't count myself amongst the fine-dining elite, having only recently sampled about a handful of one-Michelin star restaurants, mostly in the Bay Area, one in Chicago and one in LA.  To me, restaurants of this caliber offer similarly refined foods, mostly differentiating themselves by service and ambiance.  

We went to Picasso for our anniversary, which was apparently a major source of patronage besides the obligatory hot date in Vegas.  We arrived for our reservation at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and the hostess, without even looking up, instructed us to wait.  Briefly stunned, I settled into the lounge with two other couples in similar straits.  A Wednesday night besides, I've never had to wait at any Michelin-rated restaurant, especially when I've made a reservation.  

After 20 awkward minutes, we were taken to our seat on the far wall.  Along the way, I noticed plenty of empty tables, so our wait was even more disquieting.  Almost immediately, we sensed our dinner would proceed at a languorous pace; we marked time with the Bellagio water spectacle outside the windows that started every 15 minutes.  The first three shows were welcomed delights, but soon they became distractions.  

As the other couples from the lounge sat down next to us, we noticed a distinct lack of privacy.  We were barely two feet apart and in that quiet space, it was way too easy to participate in each other's private conversation.  We all ended up eating in uncomfortable silence.  

The tasting menu was misleading.  I've seen other tasting menus encompass a broad range of taste experiences, numbering up to 10 or more.  At Picasso, there are just two pricy options: Prix Fixe for $113 and Degustation for $123.  Both are more properly described as dinner settings since they came with soup or salad as appetizer, a second sampler plate, a main course, and a dessert.  

My wife ordered a cocktail to pass the time, while I got a tea service to soothe my dry throat.  Apparently, Picasso is not the place to order cocktails as my wife's cocktail came out so unpleasantly bitter that she actually had to return it after a second confirming sip.  It was the very first time she's ever had to do that.  At $14 per cocktail, it's perfectly understandable, since I expected nothing less than amazing.  The replacement was passable.  

As each well-presented but tiny portion of food came, I accompanied them all with the much needed but unsatisfactory bread.  The entrees were all uniformly moist and juicy, but I found them to be quite bland and uninspired.  The antelope I had was the juiciest piece of game meat I've ever had.  Yet, it was as forgettable as the rest of the meal, except for perhaps the slab of cold foie gras that was dressed up as an entree, a singularly disagreeable and unsettling experience.

To celebrate our anniversary, our desserts were decorated with chocolate script.  While we always appreciate the thought, the piping work looked rushed and crude, with the letters barely recognizable.  By contrast, the chocolate script we had at the one-starred Plumed Horse was a beautiful work of a real artisan.

Service was as polished as expected at other fine-dining establishments in the Bay Area.  But, towards the end of the meal, we felt neglected as we saw neither our waiter nor any bus boys for over 30 minutes.  We ran out of water and sat dejected.  

About the only element in Picasso's favor is its selection of original Picasso paintings decorating the walls of the restaurant.  I studied the two in front of me for a solid hour and started to grasp something of Picasso's artistic vision.  If I were a true aficionado or student of Picasso's works, I might find the rare opportunity to be worth the price of admission.

After three hours and a numbing procession of the Bellagio water spectacle, we tabbed out at $305 for two, including tip.  This was the first time I felt like I wasted money for a fine dining experience.  At most, the experience at Picasso was worth $150 for two, including drinks and tip.  A Michelin-rated experience, it certainly was not.  

As we left, the hostess once again told us good night without looking up.  Maybe I'm part of the invisible ethnicity in America, but that really made me feel non-existent.  Then, as if noticing a slight, the manager got the hostess to give us something of a parting gift.  Emblazoned with the Picasso logo, we found inside two small, greasy palmiers, instead of some sweets.  It was one last mis-fire that captured the whole Picasso experience.",NdX6UacaCOqqxfllgsxS0g,14,1,2,Cya1eyivbPwvOvMiM9_wpA

My boyfriend and I came to Picasso on a whim..I know I seem to start all my Yelp reviews with this sentence, but what can I say, I am quite impulsive.  We were immediately drawn to the menu and thought it was the most approachable of the Michelin starred restaurants in Las Vegas (this was considering we were dining at Robuchon two days later).   I must comment that we were both skeptical about Las Vegas Michelin starred restaurants, considering that we had yet to have a dining experience that could meet our vaulted expectations.

I have to say that everything here was absolute perfection.  The service was charming, sincere, eloquent, professional, and quite refreshing.  The sommelier was excellent, poured some exceptional wine pairings, and even challenged my certified somm. boyfriend a bit.  The food was well balanced, executed beautifully and was absolutely on par with what I expect two michelin star cuisine to be.  In all honesty, I  had only ONE problem the entire evening, just one, It's just a pet peeve of mine.  The butter was not room temperature, it needed to be tempered more.  That's it.  

I had an amazing evening, with an amazing companion.  I cannot wait to come back and do it all again.

Same format, romantic comfortable decor when we walked in at 6pm on a weekday. Wait personal were welcoming with a quiet confident demeanor. This is some thing I really like. Usually this means that staff were well trained and can handle whatever is thrown at them. This deteriorate quickly however. The place got busy quickly and the quiet confident disappeared quickly together with the service. 

I noticed that the staff were busy setting up half of this very romantic quiet restaurant into something that looks like a party room, or party area with out any solid partition. I ask our server after and he confirmed my fear that a corporate cocktail party will be using half of this room. So as you can imagine a corporate cocktail party in the middle of a romantic restaurant !!, how quiet, romantic can it be. I felt very sorry for a newly wed couple dinning that night, She even had her gown and veil on.  

The hostess was excellent, helpful and welcoming, server with a french accent has all the attribute of a great waiter. But the quality of the rest of the staff seems to take a big step down. 
Food servers or runners literally just dropped the food off, ( no food cover, no food cart) and mutter the food description and ran off. 
The food is ok, nothing exceptional. So it is just the location, ambient and service. But what ambient with a cocktail in the middle of the dinning room, what service?

The smaller of the two options had two appetizers, an entree and a dessert for $115. I wasn't feeling well or hungry enough to eat that much so I asked our waiter if I could just have a salad. Our meal came with an amuse bouche with potato soup and something fried, bread, and butter with Picasso printed on it. All the appetizers were yummy. The salad was expensive at $22 but it was good. 

My sister had the four course meal and I tried a little bite of everything and it was delicious! The courses were small. The fish appetizer with cauliflower mashed potatoes was buttery, flaky, and delicious. The pigeon was my favorite entree. I've had pigeon in Chinatown but this one was so much more flavorful and tender! The veal chop was fatty and delicious as well but I liked the pigeon better. The desserts tasted like your typical desserts. I didn't order a dessert but I had some birthday petite fours which were pretty tasty.

We ordered the 5 course tasting menu which included a lobster salad (fresh lobster with a light yet flavorful dressing), scallop in a potato puree (the scallop melted in your mouth), fois gras (served with a brilliant sauce that brought out the flavor of the fois gras), lamb chop (perfectly cooked and seasoned with vegetables and a light sauce), and dessert where we had the chocolate lava cake and the peanut butter mousse.  All courses were reasonable in size and at the conclusion of each made you anxious for the next course.

The wine list was robust but not overwhelming.  We ordered a bottle of 2007 Cabernet which was silky smooth and complimented our meal.  We took the sommolier's  advice for port pairings with our dessert.

2903010,2018-06-01,3,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I heard good things about the ambiance and food at Picasso from a friend. 

Let's start off with some good:
When making reservation, the host was very nice. She asked what the occasion was and explained to me the pros and cons of indoor and outdoor seating. Lastly, she also asked about our dietary restrictions (this is a sore point later) and I told her that we cannot eat pork.

When we arrived at our reservation, they quickly found my name and our table was ready, we took a few pictures by the paintings and the host and greeter were very friendly and helpful. 

Once we arrive at our tables, this is when the bad experiences began. After we were sitting, we were waiting an awkwardly long time before anyone acknowledged we were there. After we finally got our menus, we ordered and butter was left on our table but no bread was offered. I was busy enjoying the ambiance with my girlfriend that I did not even notice the butter and bread until she mentioned it. At this point, the waiter brings out a complimentary dish from the chef, which had some kind of soup, pastry, and prosciutto (pork). Luckily, the waiter describes every item served to us and my girlfriend immediately notices that he said prosciutto and asks the waiter if that is indeed pork. He tells us that it is, and she informs him that we cannot eat pork but it is just a strip of pork so she can just put it to the side. This upset me because what is the point of asking me of our dietary restrictions if you're just going to ignore it. I trusted a 2 Michelin star to follow through if they ask about dietary restrictions. I then proceed to ask the waiter for bread and double checked whether the dishes were ordered had pork and he informed me that the prosciutto was the only pork in the restaurant. 

We finally do get our bread, at the same time as we receive our appetizers. The rest of the meal went very well, the food was unique and delicious and we were seated at a good spot indoors where we could still see the fountain show. Once we arrive to dessert, I am met with another issue. The waiter brings out the dessert menu and shows it to my girlfriend and says ""this is our dessert menu, no pork here"" and gives us a smile. Now I will say I am not a prude, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was just joking, but I think it is HIGHLY inappropriate in this situation. If we had a serious allergy to pork, would he make the same kind of joke?

After we finish our meal, I request to speak to the manager. I did not complain about the long wait time for our menu or the lack of bread because I can give the staff the benefit of the doubt and say perhaps they were very busy with a table to give us a menu, and the person serving the bread definitely seem like he was on the go non stop all night filling water and bringing bread. I DID complain about the dietary restriction issue and frankly the manager's response was disappointing. She apologized for the mistake and acknowledged that my point of ""if you're going to ask dietary restrictions, then ignore it, then you might as well not ask at all"" and that she will make sure it doesn't happen again. 

Frankly, this is a disappointing response. For a 2 Michelin star meal at this price, the customer experience recovery was lacking. It would have been nice if she offered to comp our single glass of wine or an extra dessert for the trouble, but she just couldn't be bothered. 

I had a bad experience at Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak at the Mirage where my steak was significantly smaller than my friend's who ordered the same steak, and the manager offered to give our table free desserts as thank you for understanding. I have been repeat customers there ever since. At Picasso, my opinion and experience clearly doesn't matter. As nice as the food and ambiance is, the service and service recovery is just so disappointing.",cgoMLKDy3JhyzOkzFWGUow,3,3,1,JbQ3wQcnoqTWaNtZPpRcLQ

We were greeted by a cheeky, yet professional French host. He was pleasant, hilarious, and non-pretentious. In fact, even though the place looks like it's going to be stuffy, it's actually very warm, inviting and impressive. Upon entering the restaurant there is a massive original Picasso to gaze at, while your table is set up. The whole restaurant has a dozen or more Picasso originals to boast of. I was impressed.

We had the pleasure of sitting at the best table in the joint, right on the water-where we were watching a fountain show every twenty minutes. I seriously felt like a princess (the whole staff knew it was my birthday), and was served as one. Our waiter (Michael, I think?) was awesome. He joked around but was very professional and even offered to take a photo with us when the fountain show came up, I think he ran outside as it statred up once to make sure he captured us with it. Really cool guy, we like him.

Ok, now on to the food: O. M. G.

BEST foie gras I ever tasted (seared)!! Myself and a girlfriend went for the prix fix menu (had more choices) and another friend did the degustation menu (only 2 choices for main course). I'm happy we did it this way because we basically got to taste almost everything offered on the menu this way. The meat was perfect for all three of us, the poached lemon oysters with caviar (TO DIE FOR), and the courses were served by an entourage, I'm into that ;) I remember every course for all three of us, and honestly-that means a lot coming form me, I wish the lobster salad would have been on the prix fix menu, SO GOOD.  For dessert, they dressed up my cherry palette with a Happy Birthday and a candle, I think I had a permanent smile fixed on my face through the whole meal. 

The overall experience was definitely 5+ stars. The staff, the food, the ambiance was clearly well thought out, and it shows. You definitely have to pay for it ($600 for three) but if you can afford it, everyone needs to try this place one time in their life when visiting Vegas.

The walkway to meet the Maître d' in the sitting area showcases a number of original sculptures by Pablo Picasso, including a $34 Million dollar painting that adorns the sitting room.

Another Pablo Picasso painting, hung right over my table, had me beg a question to the waiter. This restaurant has 11 Picasso paintings totaling a worth of $300 Million dollars, he says. I am dining in a fine arts museum. Another showcase that caught my attention every 15 minutes: the water fountain show since this establishment is adjacent to the Bellagio waters.

L'Amuse-Bouche was a tasting of Vichyssoise which is typically served cold, however the chef opted to present it as warm with a topping of almonds. Pairing this classic soup is a pheasant croquette topped with a sliver of prosciutto where its bold savoriness balanced with the light, airy and delicate croquette.

Quail Salad was served with sauteed artichokes and pinenuts. Despite salad status, the perfectly cooked Quail legs rises to the top as an excellent dish.

Oysters were poached in Sauce Vermouth and garnished with Osetra Caviar. The taste felt incomplete. This can be remedied by a light squeeze of zesty lemon juice to balance the warmth of Vermouth. I concluded the caviar did little to augment the flavor of oysters. I would have probably preferred the caviar to be served on the side to separate tasting notes.

Most American-based French restaurants usually pan-sear Foie Gras. Picasso however takes the classic ""Torchon"" approach, a tedious process of gently poaching and resting the cloth-wrapped goodness for several days. The result: a pure unadulterated taste of buttery rich Foie Gras, without the bitterness of searing, almost as pure as from the Terrine method of cooking. the crunchy texture of fried toast and sweetness from the delicately caramelized pineapple slices accompanied this overly rich organ. However I found either the accompaniment too small in portions or the Foie Gras too large to achieve such a balance.

Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer had a hint of gaminess as expected from this European deer, but was nevertheless tender and surrenders easily to a butter knife. Red Zinfandel marries a perfect match. Tasting balance here are caramelized green apples which I find effective.

Peanut Butter Mousse Timbale was served with Blackberry Pâté de Fruit with Chocolate Torte and Banana Peanut Brittle Ice Cream. The brittle had a satisfying crack when broken by the dessert spoon, the Torte cake was moist and spongy, and the ice cream of course creamy. This dish was a play of textures and a grand exit to the prix fixe.

At about $300 (not counting wine), this dining experience is a bargain compared to the Guy Savoy costing twice as much for a comparable prix fixe, considering it's in the same 2-Star Michelin category. Despite noted flaws, I am giving 4 stars for good service, excellent venue (and art display) and great prices for their upscale cuisine.",6SDmuPVGsFr1M1E4FGlIdg,4,1,4,wlkiH1HyhLH6nhJpLYzWzA

2. We were brought butter early on, but the bread guy came by, looked at our table and walks right by us. We had to flag him down as well and wasn't offered bread until after our first course was served.

3. They could not keep track of what each of us ordered and would mix up our plates. 
4. They overcooked their Wagyu. When asked the end of the meal how the food was, my friend said her steak was not good. Our waiter smiles and says nothing - no apologies.

Appetizer: Tiny shot of cream of carrot soup, smoked salmon on fried wonton with creme fraiche and caviar. Tasty!

Course 1: Maine lobster salad. Not really what I would consider a salad-- more like a handful of lobster with some watercress on top. Delicious!

Course 2: Scallop on top of tiny asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. DELICIOUS.

Course 3: Foie Gras. From what I could tell, cooked very well-- but very filling.

Course 4: Japanese Kobe beef filet with vegetable ragout. Your filet mignon at Outback hasn't had haiku read to it!

The sommelier was the best part of the dinner! With each dish was a perfectly paired wine along with a in depth explanation of the wine and why it was chosen for that dish. That sommelier will forever hold a place in my heart for introducing me to one of my all time favorite wines, Hungarian Royal Tojkai (which was paired with foie gras).

When I told our waiter that I was an art enthusiast and loved Picasso, he encouraged me to walk around to view the many real works of the artist that are displayed around the restaurant. They are a must see for any art fan-- I was blown away by the rarity and variety of works they have. 

We opted for the De Gustation menu which was a great choice. We had a six course dinner, with my main dish being halibut and my husbands, lamb.  Everything from the first bite to the last was visually stunning and delicious. The scallops were so melt in your mouth delicious-- I could eat them every day for the rest of my life and never tire of them. The chef wrote Congratulations on our dessert plates and gave us additional truffles and cookies as a thank you for having our wedding dinner there. 

The wine selection was mind blowing. They also have an extensive whiskey and scotch collection which pleased my husband very much. 

The icing on this cake was that they converted the flowers my husband had delivered to our table into my wedding bouquet at my request, completely unprepared and never doing that for a customer before. When I tell you they go above and beyond-- I mean it.

1) on the website there is a truffle tasting menu, and that is what tipping over to choose Picasso for dining. However that menu was not available at the restaurant! They said it's a seasonal menu. That information is important, it should be included on the website.
2) Additionally, the website doesn't list prices. Perhaps it's a high end restaurant thing, but personally I find it hard to justify.
3) Finally while the food was great and two of the dishes were truly memorable, two dishes were less than great. Delicious yes, but not memorable.

They sat me inside, close to the doors that lead to the balcony next to the fountains. It was nice to watch the show as I was eating. Amazing decor and ambiance.

Phenomenal service all around. Turns out my server was French, and agreed to do the service in French (I'm French Canadian). He did a great job! I couldn't help but be amazed when I saw him dust the wine menu (which of course didn't need dusting).

I had the second selection Prix Fixe menu (@ $118). Specifically I chose the quail salad, the big eye tuna tartare, the sautéed medallions of deer, and a banana French toast for dessert. I also got the premium wine pairing option (@ $128).

Before the first course they offered me a soup of potatoes topped with almonds, and there was a croquette of fried fish (don't remember which fish though, sorry), with a tomato sauce. That thing was just spectacular.

The quail was good but was a little bland. It was paired with a really good rosé champagne. Unfortunately I'm also not a big fan of champagne so I missed out a little on the first course.

The big eye tuna on the other hand was fantastic. It was paired with an Austrian wine as well as a sake. I was never a sake fan but this pairing was just perfect. Wow.

The dear was delicate and perfectly cooked but also a little bland. What stole the show with this dish was the pairing of the wine (a 2012 Bordeaux 2nd cru) with the caramelized apples. Wow.

The dessert was delicious. Not too sweet and in fact a little bitter. The bread was delicious. I'm a sucker for good bread. In particular I had this bacon and onion bread... mmmm!

3062678,2014-07-19,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"As worried as I was that this place would turn out to be an overpriced tourist trap, I was pretty impressed with Picasso. The service was outstanding, the decor and ambiance were great, the view/location was nice. It's expensive but really not much if any more than a comparable meal/experience in a place like NYC or LA. I have to shave off one star because my first two courses were really subpar. Luckily, the main and the dessert were home runs, which, along with the stellar service, really saved the night. 

I went with the prix fixe menu, here were my choices:

First: Warm quail salad
Second: Ruby red shrimp
Main: Fallow deer medallions 
Dessert: Hazelnut joconde 

The first thing that came out was the amuse buche of pheasant fritter and some sort of cold potato soup. The fritter was ok, a little salty and greasy, but the cold soup tasted like plain cream to me, maybe with a little garlic. My amuse was far from buched. I hoped it wasn't a sign of things to come.

The quail salad came next, and I thought it was just alright. Some portions were too gummy and greasy for me, so I didn't finish it. The crispy parts were awesome. 

When I got the shrimp, I really started to worry. Although the accompanying flavors/textures were great, the shrimp themselves did not taste fresh to me at all. It was at this point that I was really starting to regret my decision to even come here.

Luckily, my entree was the beginning of a complete 180 for the night. The meat was cooked perfectly and was seasoned just right. All the flavors meshed well, and I devoured the whole thing. 

Dessert started with another amuse buche, and this time it was excellent. 5 mini desserts from the pastry chef. By the time I finished sampling these, I was completely full, but I wasn't going to that stop me. The Hazelnut joconde--which, for some reason, was very very different from what was described on the menu--was amazing. Rich, chocolaty, nutty and beautiful to look at, it was everything you could hope for in a dessert--nay, in life. A couple pours of coffee offset the sweetness just right. Despite my best efforts, there was no way I could finish. I was just too stuffed. The (figurative) icing on top of the night was the farewell accompanied by two mini chocolate chip muffins for the morning.

So, would I come back? Probably not. Although I had an overall good experience, two courses that miss the mark is two too many at this price point.",0LHF8ssgtB59NMC6piGJ_Q,2,0,4,2crIbDWCCZP5KhliG9lGDw

They were able to let us go out onto the balcony after dinner, which was cool. But it would have been nice to get a window seat considering there were seats still open. 

The actual dinner was quite good. I admit, i came into dinner not preparing to be blown away with the food. Considering all the michelin star restaurants that have disappointed as of late. The wine sommelier was great We went with halibut for our entree and went with a white wine. He helped us pick a very nice bottle of riesling to go with our dinner that wasn't too sweet, and was nice and crisp. 

We went with the menu degustation. (there's only two options...a five course degustation, or a pre-fix 4 course option. there's only a $10 difference...so why not go for the degustation?) and we made the right choice. The amuse bouche was a croquet and potato leek soup. The first course was a maine lobster salad. It was quite refreshing and a great way to start. Then came the seared scallop which was also really good. wasn't particularly impressed with the bread or butter, although the butter presentation offered a nice touch. The third course - seared foie gras was amazing! It was nice and buttery and went well with the toasted sliced almonds. Very impressed. Our entree on the other hand, was just ok. I had the halibut and felt it was a little on the dry side. I had the brioche for dessert, which was really good as well. Petit fours was typical. In addition, on our way out, we received a cigar box with small blue berry muffins for breakfast the next day. It was actually quite good.

I was honestly underwhelmed by this restaurant. My first french haute cuisine in Vegas was at Joël Robuchon at MGM, my second here at Picasso and my third at Guy Savoy at Caesar's. Picasso was not up to tier compared to these other two $$$$ restaurants in terms of creativity, service and decor. If you have one fancy place to pick when you're in Vegas, I don't think this should be your choice, and here's why. 

The fact that it was in Bellagio probably made you think it must be the best haute French restaurant in town, might not be true. They had a prix fixe menu when we went there and for my main course I upgraded my dish for a lot of extra money for their Wagyu just to try how it was. Not worth the money. My other two friends were a bit underwhelmed too. Honestly I couldn't even remember exactly what we ate. 

The dining room was quite dimly lit and maybe that's why we couldn't see well what we were eating lol. The decor was OK, nothing so special that would add to your dining experience. What's nice was the balcony by the famous fountain. It's great for taking photos!

The service was alright, not bad but nowhere close to exceptional. A few times we had to look around for attention, a big no no for a high-end restaurant.

Pre Fixe with wine pairing Review (sommelier review at the bottom):

1) Amuse- 4/5- bell pepper soup with some kind of fried bird and a small piece of prosciutto.  My only issue with this is that the soup wasn't really a ""one-bite"" kind of deal, it was at least 3 gulps and i wasn't sure how to play them together.

2) Butternut Squash Soup 4/5- Paired with white.  I thought the soup was pretty good, it had marshmellows and some kind of mushroom concoction in the middle.  I thought it went well with the wine selected.

3) Foie Gras with Roasted Pineapple - 6/5- this was the best foie gras ever!  It was paired with a really sweet wine, might even have been a dessert wine.  But the pairing was absolutely amazing.  The foie came with bread, microgreens, a sweet jam, and the roasted pineapple.  The pineapple was almost ""candyish"" on the outside.  the combo was ""the best i ever had, the best i ever had""

4) Short Rib- 4.5/5 - I think i should have opted for the Australlian Kobe.  The short rib was tender and great, but just wasn't anything I haven't had.  Prepared perfectly.  I thought there was a bit too much mash, and it wasn't stiff enough.

5) Desserts-

We had:

Chocolate Fondant-  2nd Favorite- it was good... but once again, wasn't too ""different""
Chocolate Beignets with peanut butter ice cream-  Favorite** The flavors were really rich and had a nice combo of textures (adding peanuts and other crunchy goodnesses)

6/7) Last two things you get is about 8 little truffle candies and when we left, we got a nice box with three ""butterflies""/palmiers.  all good.... nothing bad... 

Sommelier Review-

I thought he was great because he explained the tones/notes/flavors very well.  My only issue was that he talked a bit fast and i couldn't capture other information.  I am not a wine person, so when a sommelier tells me about where it grows and regions in spain/france that i've never heard it, that goes in one ear and through the other.  I think all sommeliers should ask ""Your level of wine knowledge?""... or maybe i'm just not getting it....

Well, OK.  I guess my paltry review might be interesting to someone (probably not), but here goes.

The interior is gorgeous.  The artwork, the decor, everything.  Everyone greets you warmly and with a smile.  No stuffiness at all, it's all very warm and inviting.  We sat outside and, except for an occasional mist of water and ducks trying to get in on our dinner, it was perfect.  The fountains look majestic from this side, illuminated by Paris and Planet Hollywood.

Our waiter was delightful.  Very entertaining, friendly, warm, knowledgeable and attentive.  All of the wait staff was top notch.  The sommelier was amazing and rightfully proud of the pairings he selected.  These were, by far and away, the best wine pairings I've ever had.  It seems like the chef and the sommelier designed their menus together, because the food and the wine perfectly compliment each other.  I mean REALLY compliment.  Not in terms of vague overtones, or mouthfeel, or anything terribly abstract.  The wines TASTED like they belonged right alongside the dishes; like they would be incomplete without each other.  Amazing.  If you do the tasting menu and don't get wine pairings you're doing it wrong.

The first course was the Maine Lobster Salad.  More lobster than salad, which is fine with me.  The succulent, sweet lobster is molded and topped with kind of like a micro-greens salad.  The apple and champagne vinaigrette gave a nice acidity which cut through the richness of the lobster.  Complimenting the dish are pink peppercorns which explode with the absolute perfect flavor (that is also present in the accompanying wine!!!)  and tiny balls of avocado and cantaloupe which give the lobster a creamy companion to contrast with the sharpness of the vinegar.

Next was the scallop.  Personally the biggest scallop I'd ever seen.  Seared beautifully with a nice brown crust.  The scallop was so tender, even on the bed of light, creamy mousseline, it seemed like it couldn't even support it's own weight.  Sweet and succulent doesn't even describe the scallop, and the veal jus was a surprisingly good accompaniment.  This was my wife's favorite dish of the evening.

And then, the foie gras.  The duck liver is just perfectly cooked: impeccably seared on the outside, with just enough heat in the middle to just soften the fat enough so that it literally (really, literally) melts in your mouth.  Accompanied by a rhubarb reduction of a sweet Hungarian wine, which is served as the pairing.  The sommelier recommended alternating every bite.  He was right.  Incredible.

I had the lamb with pisto, mint, and and a tempura zucchini flower.  The dish is just beautiful.  I almost didn't want to eat it, it was an amazing work of art.  But I did.  It was good.  Really, really good.  Lamb, surprise, was cooked perfectly.  The pisto was a perfect accompaniment, and the mint was great and not overpowering.

Desert was definitely the most artistic looking course.  Beautifully presented, and delicious on top.  I opted for the one with the mini cinnamon buns.  Not too sweet and a great balance of flavors.

Obviously I could have ended this review in one line.  What's the point?  Of course everything was amazing.  But one line wouldn't do this restaurant justice for how perfect everything is.",Nf1jFfHTHdnL3YKg8AUO0g,2,1,5,aS7K_olrMTj7f2NZo3J24Q

We went in a party of 9 and took part in the 5 course tasting menu.  There were actually two sides to the menu, and each had a couple choices per course.  Wine pairings were offered for each course.  The selection allowed for each to choose what he really wanted to try out.

The Warm Quail Salad was spectacular.  Each item was perfectly crisp -- including two beautifully cooked drummettes.  A piece of lettuce was a revelation.  I never knew how special attention to every detail can be so important.

The Ragout of Seasonal Vegetables was lovely.  Again, perfectly cooked vegetables, great attention to each piece.  Did we forget to mention the foie gras?  My first experience with the stuff, and I enjoyed it highly.

For the meat course, I had lamb.  It was, again, very good, though possibly over cooked.  Indeed, other party members had overcooked fish during this course.  However, at this point I didn't care.  The au gratin may have been the cheesiest thing I've ever consumed.  It was too powerful!  (I asked the watier what was in there, and he mentioned some spanish cheese similar to manchego.)

Dessert.  Well, I was already stuffed, but we couldn't say no.  I had the chocolate lava cake with cassis ice cream.  Just... wow.

I did not take part in the wine pairing, but everyone else did, and they seemed to enjoy them very much.  Our waiter (who seemed to be our personal waiter even though we knew that not to be the case) could speak about the wines in great detail.   In fact, he could speak to each and every dish, as well.  

The service overall was excellent.  You ordered once, and they did everything from there.  No questions asked.  If something came up, the waiter addressed only my friend who had made the reservation in a whisper so as not to distract the rest of us from our meal.   When courses were to be presented, several waiters showed up at the same time with all dishes, and they knew who got which dish without hassle.  It truly was professional, to the point of placing dishes on one side and removing from the other.  They run a tight ship.

It's impossible for me not to recommend Picasso.  There were some problems, yes, but the standard for the food was so high, and the service so excellent, that you owe it to yourself to go.  It was definitely worth it.",iWF93IYQAKPLKXPojtgEpw,4,1,5,8KM1tko2c2cQngX3Qq4kow

3213031,2011-08-09,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Picasso is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why blow $400 gambling and be left with nothing, when you can experience Chef Julian Serrano's cuisine instead?

The ambiance is second to none in Vegas. Requesting a window seat is an absolute must - it gives you an intimate, private view of the Bellagio fountains. Real Picasso artwork, worth millions, watches you from the walls as you eat. Especially notable is the Picasso behind the bar - it's one of the most unique in Vegas.

For dinner, you choose between either the 4-course Degustation menu ($123) or 3-course Prix Fixe menu ($119). Wine pairings are offered for an additional $63 or $55, respectively. 

My advice to you regarding the wine pairings is this - SPEND THE MONEY. Not only will a master sommelier entertain you with the history of each wine before pouring you a glass, but you'll also get to taste wines with extremely limited production runs (ex. only 100 bottles made each year).

The flavor of the wine, when paired with the food simply needs to be experienced to be believed. The best illustration of this was the sauteed ""A"" streak of foie gras. The peaches in the dish, paired with the muscat grape and cinnamon flavors in the wine, made it the best dish I have ever eaten in my life.

Must-haves include the foie gras, deer, quail salad and the Colorado lamb. While the dishes are not huge, you will not leave Picasso hungry. All-you-can eat bread, complimentary amuse bouche h'oeuvres and a complimentary tower with bite size desserts will be served.

Highly recommended - 5 stars.",4S743WSDVTfSXR3ClJnj7A,0,0,5,WbHaPXPwY2Ff_LScmTWQWA

Leading up to the night they let us know that it was dependent on the season and timing whether they would actually have truffles that night. They were supposed to call sometime before hand to confirm.

Oddly they never called, and we ended up confirming with them the day of a few hours before heading there. This may have been a warning sign we ignored.

The restaurant itself is wonderful. It has an unbelievable view of the Bellagio fountains and a great ambiance. Our waiter was excellent, as were the other attendants that night.

Unfortunately when I received my first truffle dish of the night I immediately noticed an overwhelming ammonia odor. I was taken aback and was actually certain it wasn't from cleaning chemicals because of just how strong it was, knowing they wouldn't serve a dish with visible cleaning liquids in it.

The actual flavor of the truffles was essentially non existent, probably because much of the flavor comes from it's normally pleasant distinctive aroma. For some reason I felt too embarrassed to actually say anything, even to my parents. I feared that if the chef hadn't noticed something like this that perhaps I was simply allergic to this type of truffle, or that I was sick. I proceeded to eat each truffle dish with what basically amounted to ammonia flakes on them.

The wine pairings were amazing. Truthfully it was some of the best wine I have ever had. The desert was also exceptional, and again the staff was top notch.

Once I arrived home I did some research on fresh truffle and discovered that this was almost certainly a case of bad truffles that should not have been served to us.

I picked the Poached Oysters as my first course, since I love raw Oysters.  I ate it at first without putting in the lemon, and it was very fishy.  (I often do that with other raw oysters I eat and don't usually have this issue).  But after I put in the lemon, then it was ok.

My main course I picked the Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer.  It was VERY GOOD.  I orderd it medium, and it was good perfectly.  Very juicy.  The only thing is, I would recommend not trying to finish the sides that it came with (sweet peas and glazed pear, etc), because at the end I was left with a feeling of ""too sweet"" because of that.
Both came with a choice of dessert from their dessert menu.  Their dessert was ok, not memorable.  Chaya in LA definitely have better dessert.

Service was as expected for a high end restaurant like this.  Although the people who brought out our dishes kept getting confused which one was mine and which one was my fiance, when the main waiter saw that, he corrected it right away (although he was pretty busy most of the time).  We did have to ask for bread a few times while we wait for our food (there a big gap in time between each course, took us over 2 hours to eat and it's not because we eat slow).

In conclusion.  I highly recommend the Pan Seared Scallop, and venison.  Is the food worth the price?  I would say you're definitely not just paying for the food, you're also paying for the atmosphere, their large fresh flowers centerpiece in the middle of the restaurant, and all the Picasso painting they have on the wall.  By the way, Picasso is listed as a Five Diamond restaurant  on the AAA rating (there are only 52 of those in U.S.)",5Sd0CqGeSmSV6OaPTMGLJg,1,0,4,RQQi1H2Ql9uTP3xj4blYiQ

3333121,2011-02-11,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"My expectations were very high for dinner at this Michelin two-star rated restaurant.  Unfortunately, I think PIcasso suffers from the same malaise as many a Las Vegas luxury spot:  While quite good, something about the necessity of mass producing that product leaves the end result short of what you might find in a peer restaurant in New York or Chicago.

First, the space the restaurant occupies is very nice.  True to its name, several original PIcasso paintings adorn the walls.  The serene atmosphere of the dining room offers a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the casino floor, only occasionally to be disturbed by the amazing water show of the Bellagio fountains outside.

The food, again, was very good with some particular highlights but did not rise to the level of providing a truly unique and special experience.  I had the tasting menu while my guest had the prix fixe.  The Maine Lobster Salad looked very good on the plate but was fairly pedestrian in taste.  The Sauteed ""A"" Steak of Foie Gras was very good, however I did not care much for the accompanying rhubarb and roasted pistachio.  The main course of Sauteed Filet of Turbot was a solid dish, though nothing extraordinary.  Of the other dishes I tried, I thought the Roasted Maine Lobster was very good, and the Beggar's Purse filled with chocolate risotto pudding may have been the dish of the night.

The level of service is about par with other high-end Vegas eateries.  Admittedly, I was hoping for something more along the lines of the outstanding service I received from another Michelin two-star, Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  All of this is not in any way to say that Picasso is a bad restaurant.  However, I could not help but be a little bit disappointed, and I think Picasso would more appropriately fall among the Michelin one-stars.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,0,0,3,OTHQ-D1xxnRSh9SrjqkQCA

Food: SO GOOD. You get a choice of 2 tasting menus. (different people can get different ones at the same table which I appreciated). We both got the Degustation Menu. SO delicious. The lobster salad and the lamb and the scallops and the giant dessert...omg. SO good. I cannot say it enough. Also, they give you a complimentary potato soup shooter pre-meal.

From walking into Picasso we could tell we were in for an amazing experience. We were welcomed by numerous staff, the ambiance was fantastic with fresh flowers, and I will go ahead and mention that we were seated right by the window which made dinner spectacular because we were able to watch the fountain show and to see all the lights on the strip. 
My husband and I choose the gustation menu along with the wine pairing. I debated choosing the wine pairing, but am so glad that I did because I was able to taste/ experience the finest pairings. The starter (lobster salad) was fantastic. Next, and my favorite, was the scallops with a wine pairing from Budapest which was amazing! For my main course I choose the snapper (which I've never had before), and it along with the wine pairing from Sicily was again amazing!

Highlights:

-Amuse bouche: a bamboo skewer with 1/2 of a hard-boiled quail egg, smoked salmon (spritzed with lemon), and caviar. Simple, but perfectly balanced and the best amuse I've had in a long time.

- Scallop: beautiful sear on a bed of pomme puree with a demi-glace reduction, with a length-wise section potato chip for texture. I also had some bacon bread with this-- which has inspired me to bake some at home!

-Foie Gras: Usually I prefer a torchon with brioche, but this was the best seared piece I have ever had. Here the technique was just amazing: an perfect sear on both sides-- the inside was like butter. The pistachio garnish added texture and brought out the nutty qualities of the Sauternes for the pairing.

-Lamb:Best lamb I've ever had. Apparently it's organic and sourced from Colorado, from a farm that tries to raise them in a Wagyu type of fashion. It was so incredibly tender that I was sure they sous-vided it, but the waiter claimed it was roasted. It was served with a rosemary infused demi-glace reduction and an elegant take on ratatouille. Ordered it rare instead of the suggested med-rare, and was glad I did. Syrah aged in American oak made for a nice pairing.

-Dessert: The standout of the plate was the Guiness ice cream.

The service was excellent as well. (There was a goofy moment when we asked if there were any additional pairings not listed on the menu and the waiter told us that ""the wine gets progressively heavier to match the food"" lol, I should hope so! And one waiter seemed particularly enamored with asking ""can I get you anything else,"" which is a bit odd when repeated and in the context of a tasting menu. What are we going to do, ask for ketchup?  )

I appreciated that we weren't rushed in the slightest, despite having one of the nice two-tops right by the window. We were at the restaurant for over 3.5 hours, in part because we started with champagne before the dinner.

I really liked how they kept the restaurant decor simple except for the dazzling Picassos, and the beautiful multi-colored informal flowers on the center stand, which played off of the bright colors in the paintings.

I thought that the dinner was also a good value. There were many expensive ingredients, and dinner came to ~600 for two (though we spent around 200 on beverages). This makes it the best value tasting menu I've ever had, and one of my all-time favorite meals.",FReTWyIzA3Xw2vVNm6QaNA,11,3,5,I7v5V3K7gUs4Pl8PbhJk2g

The food here is amazing.  It is perfection.  Yes, perfection!!  Imagine eating something that could not have been cooked or could not have tasted any better.  That is Picasso for you.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and all the sauces and flavors were perfect.  Nothing was too chewy or too dry or too salty.  The oysters and foie gras were like Heaven in my mouth.  The lobster option had an extra charge, but it was worth the extra money paid.  My taste buds have never been so happy.  Everything was PERFECT! 

The ambiance is extremely upscale and romantic.  If you can get a terrace or window seat, you have the best seats in the restaurant.  

Service was excellent.  Fast and attentive.  I asked where the restroom was located and the server escorted me all the way to the restroom.  When I returned, my table napkin was refolded for me and the seating area had looked like I just arrived.  Then, here comes the server to help me push my chair in behind me.  Why, thank you :)  So fancy!

I've been to many restaurants throughout the globe and it blows me away how good many of the restaurants are getting in LV. Out of the fifteen or so top that I've tried over the past four years in Vegas, Picasso takes the top rating. Not only that, it competes with numerous world class global eateries.

I was highly impressed with how good the food was, the beautiful presentation, the relaxed atmosphere (with Picasso artwork everywhere), and as important, the spectacular service. Dialed in and comfortably present without being seen.

Now, there's a price to pay. It was the most expensive dinner I've had in recent memory and quite possibly ever. This too was with only two bottles of $100 wine between three people. But you get what you pay for. In addition, the sommelier didn't make me feel cheap not wanting a $300 bottle of wine... in fact, the opposite. He read me well and recommended a fantastic bottle of pinot from the Loring Wine Company that I knew about from their whites. Well done all around.

What I liked:
The window and outside seating have a great view of the Bellagio Lake fountain show.
The service was polite and attentive.
The Poached Oysters were tasty (and the only item that I liked).

What I didn't like & why I will not return:
The story: The menu has only 2 fixed price courses (WE DID BOTH, so we tasted most of the main course items offered on the menu).  In course #1 you can make a choice out of two options for both the final course plate and desert.  In course #2 you can make a few more choices.  Most of the items were just OK: timid Lobster Salad, one scallop on mashed potato and gravy (weird), and underwhelming lamb chops.  How about that Roasted Pigeon?  I've had more exciting Peking Duck at Chinese restaurants.

The short: The food was all image and no flavor.  The Foie Gras was especially disgusting; every bite was like an explosion of greasy fat.  Remember walking at the park with all those geese?  The Foie Gras is the liver from those little pooping guys.

Other notes:
The food is really rich, even though the portions look fairly small, and a full course is more than enough food for one person.
The ladies will get a complimentary small box of desserts.
The French dining experience is typically long and relaxed, so don't go here if you only have 1 hour to eat.

The photos of the food look cool, but what were you positive reviewers thinking?  However, it is possible on the night I visited the chefs were replaced by raving circus midgets.",WFioCidbh2iO7Qvf2jKb2A,0,0,2,2VXyoBpsvGY_1h-PaFqEoA

The ambience is perfect, the real Picassos around you set the scene. You are in a museum, you are in a restaurant, food is art. Which brings us to José Serrano's Truffle Menu with Wine Pairing. It is really hard to describe all the flavours i discovered that night.

3520785,2016-09-08,5,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"*** My goodness 1000th Yelp review after 5 long years *** 

Instead of writing a Yelp review about Yelp itself (some Yelpers do it to signify the cornerstone of their Yelp achievements), I think it is more interesting to write about this amazing Michelin Two Stars (2008 & 2009) and AAA Five-Diamond Award (1998 ~ 2015) traditional French fine-dining restaurant in Las Vegas. Not only did this $128 (not including tax and tip) meal brought out my raw emotion, all seafood dishes at Picasso were some of the best seafood (specifically Maine lobster, scallop, and black bass) that I've ever tasted.

Originally I made my 6:30 PM reservation through the Opentable, but I actually arrived 10 minutes before my reservation time because I simply did not want to miss out this opportunity of a lifetime. Even though I visited the Bellagio for multiple times (*cough* craps tables *cough*), it took me a while to pinpoint the exact location.

Direction (From Caesars Palace or Bally's): Walk across the pedestrian bridge and find the Louis Vuitton shop first. From there, just keep walking towards the Bellagio's casino floor until you see the Chanel shop (you need to turn back if you accidentally step into the casino floor). Now look around and you should see the escalator. Take the escalator and make an immediate left turn once you reach the basement level.

Menu (two options): The prix fixe menu is a $118 (no tax and tip; additional $58 for a sommelier's wine pairing) take-your-pick 4-course menu. The menu degustation is a $128 (no tax and tip; additional $68 for a sommelier's wine pairing) mostly fixed 5-course menu (you can only pick one of the three entrées for the 4th course as well as couple dessert options).

Dining atmosphere: You can see the majestic Fountains of Bellagio (30-minute per show before 8 PM and 15-minute per show after 8 PM), but you can't really hear the music because windows are pretty much soundproof. And don't forget that you will be surrounded by $100+ million worth of Picasso's artworks. Good service (I expected no less from a Michelin Two Stars restaurant), but I didn't have too much of a small talk with my waiter.

*** Menu Degustation, 5-Course Dinner ***

[Amuse Bouche] Creamy soup and croquette: Who doesn't like melt-in-your-mouth croquette? Croquette was just as good, if not better, than Porto's croquette.

Breads: Three options were available - cheese, onion, and French baguette. Nothing to write about.

[1st Course] Maine Lobster Salad (Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette): The combination among melon, tomato, and natural sweetness from the Maine lobster were truly amazing. Even after two long months, I can still picture the umami taste from this salad. (5/5)

[2nd Course] Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop (Potato Maousseline and Jus de Veau): I never had a scallop like this - slightly charred scallop bursting with flavors. This mashed potato was sooooo silky smooth. (5/5)

[3rd Course] Sautéed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras (Crab Apple Sous Vide with Ground Cinnamon, Clove, Nutmeg, Foie Gras Almond-Pistachio Crumble): At first foie gras tasted fatty with melt-in-your mouth texture, then out of nowhere the unknown floodgate suddenly opened and this unique foie gras meaty flavor just overwhelmed my taste buds. Pistachio crumble gave a good finishing touch. (4.75/5)

[4th Course] Sautéed Filet of Black Bass (Court-Bouillon Sauce and Fresh Herbs): Again another melt-in-your-mouth dish, but by this point I started to feel a bit overwhelmed because the previous dish (foie gras) was a REALLY heavy dish (it is the feeling you get from eating too much fatty food). (5/5)

[5th Course] Sauterne Poached Pear (Almond Frangipane, Blood Orange Butter Pear Sauce, French Butter Pear Sorbet): Loved the crunchiness from frangipane, but it was definitely the least memorable dish. (3.5/5)

Assortment of sweet bites (a chocolate truffle, a mint meringue, a berry pate de fruit, etc.): Other than that one sweet bite I can't remember, all other four were alright. (2/5)

Banana muffins (inside of a souvenir box): I was given two banana muffins just right before I left ... sadly I didn't get to try any of them because I left my box at the Zumanity show. Nooooooo!

***

I finished the entire 5-course dinner in 120 ~ 135 minutes and I didn't even do the wine pairing. So if you are planning to watch a show right after the dinner, then give yourself at least 3 hours just for this dinner.

In terms of the dining experience with additional surprising elements, I still think Alinea in Chicago is the place to go for that unique experience. Now if you are looking for an amazing high-end FOOD experience (minus the dessert), then Picasso is a better choice than Alinea in that aspect. Picasso delivered a truly Michelin Two Stars worthy food and I would definitely recommend Picasso over Spago (a Michelin Two Stars restaurant in Los Angeles).",rQLEfpfSjVK-3dBmIMKZDA,15,5,5,XMM_hWxH1UPYr234UJ24Jw

The restaurant is beautiful. I enjoyed the view of the Bellagio fountains and was amazed with the art. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They were attentive to our needs without being overbearing.

I had the degustation menu (Maine Lobster Salad, Scallops, Foie Gras, Lamb, and a pear dessert) with wine pairing. My boyfriend had the prix fixe menu (Warm Quail Salad, shrimp, fallow deer, and warm chocolate fondant) with wine pairing. 

I highly recommend considering wine pairings at Picasso. In my opinion, the master sommelier did an excellent job pairing the wines to the different courses. The wines alone tasted ok; in fact a few were not appealing at all, I would use a spittoon if they had one. However, the wines with the courses made my dining experience so much better. For example, I typically do not like sweet wines but the Foie Gras with Tokaji Aszú was fantastic. I wouldn't let the boyfriend sample the dish. It was all mine. 

I didn't rate the Picasso 5 stars because two of my courses, the lobster salad and scallops, were good....not great. I also did not care for the pear dessert. Perhaps we'll try Picasso again when the weather is warmer so we can sit on the patio.",lsyQyTlLiPIJN76Xfqf4JA,0,0,4,fjKd4yB-7HiF2H_z85s1cQ

My husband and I both had the pre fixe menu with wine pairings. We selected different items for each course and we both tasted everything. I expected the food to be excellent, but this was more than just food. It was art. Of course, it was visually appealing--every plate designed with colors and shapes for maximum ocular impact. With every bite, I had the sense that someone's plan to surprise and delight was unfolding before me. And the wine pairings? Most superb I've ever experienced. Even with dishes I wouldn't normally have loved--the foie gras, for example--it was a bit sweet for me, but the luscious Hungarian Aszu revealed a depth of delicate aroma I couldn't get enough of. 

And throughout the meal we were continually surprised. First, with a yummy amuse bouche, and at the very end with a dainty little box of pastries. The next morning I savored the pastries over coffee and remembered the beautiful evening. After the dessert course, they presented us with the prettiest little tray of chocolates. I've never felt so spoiled. 

And where would you like to enjoy this splendid meal? Let's see, how about in a room filled with the bright, rich colors of a Picasso painting? Over the top flower arrangements and the Master's artwork on the walls. Oh yes, and the view? The famous dancing waters of Bellagio's fountains outside the window. 

Memories are better than things. Things can disappear in an instant through theft or disaster or carelessness, but memories are forever. I'll always treasure our dinner at Picasso--a delicious, perfect evening. xoxo",zINSpwBI9aubNpBAxG8SZw,8,7,5,b-bJr_4TGAzZOsF3JEI3vw

This was my finest dining experience in the US by a good margin (Only a certain meal in Japan can best it). My girlfriend surprised me with reservations here for my birthday. It just so happens I've had my eye on the place since I moved to Vegas as it has earned great praise over the years and is relatively reasonably priced for a place that was recognized as a two star Michelin restaurant when they last rated in Vegas.

I was excited to try the Degustation menu as it had a lot of courses that I wanted to try anyway. Every course was delicious, but I truly enjoyed both the scallop dish and the lobster salad. The lamb was fantastic, and the foie gras was rich buttery goodness.

One of the highlights of Picasso is obviously the view, where you can be up close to the Bellagio fountain shows. I generally think sitting inside is more comfortable, but this is one of those restaurants where you might want to sit outside to enjoy the fountains. That being said, it will be much noisier if you choose that route.

Their dessert menu is actually quite extensive and I went with the mousse cake. I was surprised by the size of the portion, considering that most of the courses were petite. I was given quite the slab of cake! Accompanying it was a nicely written Happy Birthday message as well as a candle. The cake itself was rich and delicious, but a little too much as I couldn't quite finish it. Sometimes fine dining leaves you a little hungry - Picasso probably will not.

Ironically, I read Lena C's review beforehand so I knew that the richness of the menu might get to my tummy, so it was nice to be forewarned!

Let me start by mentioning that I'm beginning to becoming a patron of Michelin rated restaurants.  Not that I've been to a lot, but I've been to the French Laundry, Michael Mina, and now Picasso.   For overall experience, both ambiance and culinary, I think the Picasso is my top pick.  Let's be clear here too, all three of the aforementioned venues are a drastic cut above the hundreds of other random other places I've been.  

The food at the Picasso is only slightly less Earth shattering than the French Laundry - and at a considerably more palatable price.  Each bite is an experience worth remembering, and the fogra was even better than FL; seared to an amazing perfection.        

The service was exactly what you would expect from a Michelin rated venue.  Calling the staff knowledgeable and attentive would be a disservice.  The servers are a necessary component of the experience.  

Here's where Picasso stands out.  The ambiance, especially on the outdoor balcony, is breath taking.  I mean truly.  There you are, dressed to perfection (as much as possible), eating the most delicious food your mouth has enjoyed, and sitting behind the Bellagio fountains in that dry desert air; Frank Sinatra playing in the background, and surrounded by over $100 million in beautiful art.   It's impossible to describe but I promise you all, it's one of - if not the most- enjoyable experience I've had.

3630563,2012-10-23,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Spoiler alert: the bill is average $120 per person.

With that being said, if you want to be a foodie...or at least act the part...or just be treated like you own the Bellagio for a night, come right on down.  It's located down the escalators and it will be one of the most decadent meals of your life.

I don't claim to know wine or liqueurs but I know they must be seriously good for the price they offer and the staff is great about suggesting pairings with your meal.  What I do claim to know is tasty food and that they do deliver.

You can pick from 2 menus: the Degustation menu (5 course) or the Prix Fixe (4 course).  With only a $10 difference, I opted for the 5 course.  I will summarize because many have tasted the gloriousness that I have and have lived to write about it as well.

Maine Lobster Salad: salad as in tuna salad, chicken salad, etc.  Cool, refined, and accentuates the lobster.  Not overly drowned in superfluous additives like mayo.

Pan-seared Scallop:  I have tasted tender scallops... but this was picture-perfect, cut-with a fork, sophisticatedly simple.

Steak Foie Gras: probably my least favorite but only by personal taste.  Nice blacked crust with a tangy center.  Basically blackened foie gras.

Kobe Filet Mignon: yes ladies and gentlemen, I chose to add $160 to my meal and try this heavenly cut of beef.  Perfectly marbled and juicy (recommended medium-rare).  While I may not agree that it should cost an additional $160, I cannot deny that it was the highlight of my dinner and probably the best cut of beef I have ever tasted.  Also accompanied by a the best ring of mashed potatoes but still no contest.  You can get kobe cuts across the street at Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris and frankly better than anything I've eaten in my life (until I ate at Picasso).

Dessert:  by now you will be full and probably not appreciate the choice as much as you should.  Tough choices... but if you make it this far, congratulations and here's to hoping payday comes soon after this meal.

Great staff...they know that for a lot of us, this meal hurts the pockets, but they guide you through it and they talk like all those fancy waiters in the movies too",E3xzVQItf_NJpVnDt8VDUQ,4,1,5,gj1w9OGSvYQjzNIiQf5T8g

You definitely want to have reservations as every table was full on Saturday night and since this is a fine dining establishment give yourself plenty of time to enjoy your meal, at least 2 hours if not more.

My husband ordered the Prix Fixe menu ($118) and I thought that the Degustation (tasting, $128) menu had fewer courses so that's what I ordered. Turned out I was wrong!  They have an extensive wine and cocktail list but we both ordered the Sommelier Wine Pairing and were not disappointed. 

The bread selection was lovely and the green olive bread that I ate was delicious. I am a bread girl but tried to control myself so that I had room for everything that was to come!

From the Degustation Menu:
Amuse bouche: Vichyssoise soup served with a flash fried cheese which was tasty.
Maine Lobster salad
Seared scallop (I was a little disappointed with this dish and felt like it lacked flavor)
Warm Quail salad (they allowed me to substitute instead of the Foie Gras)
Roasted Lamb Tournedo (This was the highlight of the meal and melted in my mouth!)
Chocolate Fondant
Petit Fours
Gift: two banana muffins to take home in a lovely gift box

Prix Fixe Menu included the Amuse Bouche, Petit Fours and the boxed gift of muffins.
Pea Soup
Ruby Shrimp
Maine Lobster
Devil's Food Cake with Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream


The service was perfect and everything arrived in a perfectly timed procession. The servers and the sommelier were friendly and not snooty as you can sometimes find in restaurants at this price point.

The website suggests dressy attire and we dressed to impress but noted that others seemed to have just wandered into the restaurant from the casino and didn't know about the dress code.

Children over the age of 5 are welcome in the restaurant which helps ensure that the ambiance is not disturbed by cranky, tired toddlers.

I always have to check out the bathrooms in fancy restaurants and this one is super fancy with real cloth towels.

We've eaten at all of the top restaurants in Las Vegas now and will definitely return to Picasso at some time in the future. Overall the delicious food, romantic ambiance and top notch service will bring us back!",8LRRYce7kIV4pqXNs_lL6A,5,3,4,o9gY8tJbZ5cGC-NL6hLmvw

-1 star for the final lamb course. Somehow, having the pan seared foie gras right before basically stole the show. I think it's pretty hard to beat that dish. But maybe I'm just Californian and deprived? Anyway, the lamb was cooked well, but didn't wow me.

Picasso has been on my list for years now! I went to visit my boyfie a couple weeks ago with no expectations, but he had this dinner planned for weeks. GF appreciation dinners are simply the best :) 

The both of us opted for the 4 course prix fixed menu so we could order different things and try 8 different things. For the first course we had soup and the poached oysters. The soup was good, but lukewarm. The poached oysters were out of this world! 10/10 would order the poached oysters over and over again. 
The second course we ordered the foie gras and salmon. The foie gras was served in pate form with dessert type pie/tart. I really did not understand this dish and just could not swallow it. I had the boyfie eat this dish because it was just not my cup of tea. He did not even end up eating the tart/pie crust part either. The salmon was amazing and perfectly cooked. The only downside was that it looked like farm raised salmon. 
The third course was lobster and halibut. Both were great! I'd highly recommend going with all the fish dishes here because those were the best cooked/tasting. By the dessert course I thought I was going to explode so we ended up sharing the peach dessert. Yummy. 

We also went with the wine pairing which was just OK. All the wines by itself were great, but I just didn't feel like each one complimented the dishes perfectly. I wish we had just ordered a bottle and saved the extra $$$. 

The service was good, but not amazing. Not sure how this place used to carry 2 michelin stars, but it felt more like a 1 star restaurant. The view of the fountain show made up for most things though :) This is a very romantic, intimate setting. The food wasn't A+, but it was such a special dinner.

I will say that the ambience was lovely: we were seated outside with a great view of the fountains, which was definitely the best part of the whole experience. Overall, though, we did not enjoy the trip as much as we had hoped for such a special outing, and especially given the price point and accolades.

Even if you don't get to sit on the terrace watching the Bellagio fountain show ringside all night, you still get to bask in the presence of seriously gorgeous art (it's not like they have a handful of piddling Picasso sketches--there are over a dozen full-blown paintings, and they are lovely).  Of course, you can still see the fountain show going off via the floor-to-ceiling windows even if you're seated inside.

Even though this is a truly special dining experience, the pricing is on par with or significantly less than many comparable places in Vegas (or in DC, for that matter).  For example, the short tasting menu at Guy Savoy in Caesar's is over $250.  At Picasso, the largest tasting menu is $125.  And you absolutely cannot go wrong with the food.

The sommelier is an amazing guy.  Rarely have I seen someone enjoy the enjoyment of others so much.  There's such a huge selection of wines by the glass that both times I've been there I've just had the sommelier take care of pairings for me.  I have had more than one truly subliminal tasting moment at Picasso because of the skill, care, and teamwork of the staff.

All the courses were delicious and plated very nicely. But the 2 that stood out to me were the scallop and Foie Gras. The scallop was large and perfectly cooked with the perfect texture. The Foie Gras...oh man the Foie Gras was the most divine and decadent thing i've ever tasted. The portion was extremely generous, it could have been served as a main course...and it just melted in your mouth. OMG i would go back solely for the foie gras. I wanted to savour every bite.

The service was attentive but not intrusive, and everything was on point for that night. it made our dining experience very enjoyable, plus you're surrounded by original picasso artwork and you get a great view of the bellagio fountains.

We had reservations at 8:30, and arrived right on time. We were told by the hostess that we would be seated momentarily, and after 20 minutes, we were finally brought to our table. After being seated and brought our menus, our waiter kindly greeted us, and asked wether we wanted still or sparkling water. After 17 minutes, we finally received water, and was able to give our waiter our drink orders. In total we waited 37 minutes to receive water. It may not seem like a long time, but as a diner in one of las vegas' fancier restaurants, those minutes seem like an eternity. I would've expected much better service at a restaurant of this caliber. This would be the theme for the entire night. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, but it just seemed like the restaurant was way understaffed. 
   
    As for the food, my wife ordered the 5 course menu, and I ordered off the 4 course menu. All the dishes were well prepared with fine ingredients, but this was vegas, and we wanted to be wowed. For our first course my wife ordered the lobster salad which she enjoyed, and I ordered the quail. The quail was well cooked, tender and salted properly, but not memorable. My wife had the scallop for the second course and I had the shrimp. The scallop was seared well and sitting on a bed of potatoes. It tasted exactly as it sounds. My shrimp was also cooked well and sitting on top of a slice of zucchini. It tasted like good shrimp sitting on top of a slice of zucchini.  My wife had an extra course, which was foie gras. Which was nice and rich, prepared on par with the other foie gras dishes that i've had. 
    
  For our main courses my wife had seared fish, which she found to be a little dry. I ordered the veal chop with jus, a giant hunk of meat that was prepared well, but once again, nothing spectacular.

I chose this restaurant as the place where me and my new wife could celebrate our marriage with a romantic dinner - yes, it was our honeymoon. 

The service was impeccable and we were always taken care of at any given time during the moment we entered through the doors. From the hostess who greeted us and asked us if we would like to sit inside or outside - outside in case you were wondering - to our waiter who escorted us through the menu choices and the wine selection. We felt completely taken care of. Lets not forget the runners/servers who constantly made sure that our water/wine glass were never empty. The experience here was truly luxurious. 

Fun fact is that I did not know this was a Michelin starred restaurant - two at that. I chose this place from a coworker's recommendation. I requested the reservation from American Express Concierge. 

After trying the food here, my taste buds and expectations of how food should taste were definitely propelled to another world. I was astonished how delicious, delicate, and well-seasoned everything was on our plates. Lets not forget the plating and presentation, which I am sure the name Picasso was chosen for this reason. We were worried about the amount of food being offered, but our one dinner lasted roughly three hours and we ended up completely stuffed and could not handle all of the desserts. Even after several weeks after trying this place, other restaurants have paled in comparison to this place, which doesn't seem all that fair to other restaurants, but I cannot forget the feeling and taste of when I tried the foie gras or the piece of salmon. I was always the type to love food as it fills my hunger, but never really focused on the taste as much as I did this night. However, this place really did open my eyes to what a culinary experience really entails. From the first set to the main course, it worked beautifully in harmony to deliver a well balanced experience. It is very hard to describe the food in words and all I can recommend is to try this place the next time you are in Las Vegas and you have a special occasion to dress up one night for a romantic evening. 

Decor inside was truly luxurious as you would expect. Tid bit: the bathroom was cool. The outside seating was phenomenal with the Bellagio fountain constantly playing throughout the evening. If it is remotely chilly, the restaurant does have high quality heaters besides each table. It was a bit chilly on our night, but the heaters worked well and we felt as cozy as if we were inside dining.

We have dined in Paris at  1-2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurant and wondered how this would stack up. It did not. I can pick restaurants in the US that are far more deserving of stars than this place.  However the food was average, but the service was horrifying! We had a terrible waiter but I must say the back waiter ""Jesus"" made our experience a lot better. I hope he gets promoted to waiter soon.

Things you wouldn't expect from a place of Michelin Stars: 
1. Ladies chair not being pulled out
2. Wrinkled table linens
3. Butter dish not being refilled with extra bread.
4. Entree being served to the wrong person.
5. The table behind us got an amuse bouche when they were on dessert!
6. Little to no seasoning on the potato and leek soup.
7. When the waiter brought us the bill he had a bic pen inside (now I know what your thinking, how snobby is this chick- but seriously people that can loose you a star)
8.  Waiter forgetting your cocktail order and then me having to cancel it when we got to the dessert coarse. 
9. The wine binder had ripped pages in it that kept falling onto the floor. 
10. The service was so rushed!!! If I am paying over three hundred dollars for a meal- then I own that table for at least 2 hours!
11. The waiters looked panicked and one almost hit me with a tray of food as I was walking to the ladies room. 


I think this is enough said. People who gave this place an excellent review should think about traveling to better places before reviewing.",bTkH9pJcsKM4CfQ1tciD1g,2,0,1,UlEv_nedRz1YZihk-c917g

If you are able to sit close to a window, you will get a good view of Bellagio's water show!  The restaurant is not super big, so making a reservation in advance is probably a good idea.  We had a reservation for 8pm and told our waiter that we had a 10pm show in the hotel just so he would be able to get us out of there in enough time. 
 
Along with the fancy service we received here, we started the night with a bottle of one of their finest Chardonnay's, which the sommelier highly recommended.  The wine was served at just the right temperature, so I figured Picasso would continue to impress us as the night progressed.

My first course selection was the Maine Lobster Salad, which was a light and refreshing salad.  It was a good option; however, not even a month later and I really can't remember anything else about it.

My second course consisted of a Chilean Sea Bass with Asparagus and Hollandaise sauce.  The sea bass was sautéed with an incredible seasoning, but what I loved most about this dish was the beautiful plating.  I really enjoyed this meal.

For dessert, I ordered a chocolate mousse/tart type of thing that I didn't care for.

We opted for the wine pairings which added a healthy price tag, but were totally worth it. We drank a wine that had been in production since the time of Christ. That's cool enough, but what was best was our French waiter. When you see a cartoon there's always a French waiter. This guy was the best waiter ever. At no point did he retrieve information about the food. Everything was committed to memory. So you're thinking, well, yeah, its a Prix Fixe, it doesn't change. I'd agree. However, we asked a lot of questions, being foodies and he was a wealth of knowledge with the perfect accent and mustache. Our meal was beautiful and delicious. Smoked salmon with quail egg on a cracker paired with a beautiful wine for a first course. A lovely frisee salad.

This bite was accompanied with a small cup of corn bisque with slivered almonds. It was an excellent start to whet the palate. The bisque was perfect and the almonds provided a nice crunchy contrast to the smooth texture of the bisque. As for the rest of the meal, it was pretty good.

First course was the Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette. The salad had huge pieces of lobster meat and it was accompanied with tiny four tiny balls that were made of different melons and avocado. The pink peppercorns sprinkled about the dish also provided a nice sweet explosion of taste. Excellent!

Second course was the Pan Seared Nantucket Scallop
with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau. The scallop was the most perfectly cooked scallop I've ever had. It was just the right texture without being too rubbery in the middle and perfectly seared on the outside. However, couple people complained about some gritty sand in the last few bites. The potato chip provided a cool umbrella-like decoration but was nothing special otherwise. Excellent!

Third course was the Sauted Foie Gras with Rhubarb and Crushed Roasted Walnuts. I actually thought this was a really nice dish because the liver was very nice and buttery and tasted almost like a super tender cut of steak (I've never had foie gras). But I guess the girls thought the livery and fatty taste was just too much. The rhubarb provided a nice sweet, sour, and bitter taste and I loved the walnuts that added a nutty component to the dish. Excellent!

The fourth course was Roasted Aged Lamb Loin with some type of bean. This was kind of disappointing for a main dish. It was nothing special and the loin was a little bit chewy. The other main dish was halibut, which was also just decent. I didn't like how the loin sat in a soupy pool of beans. Average.

The fifth and last course was a bunch of desserts that we all kind of shared. I got the Walnut Tart with Brled Bananas, which was also just average. The other chocolate desserts were too dense and rich. Average.

The dinner ended with some small pieces of candies and chocolates which were nice. The service was also pretty good except one time when I left to use the restroom, they took my napkin, but didn't replace it. The meal was $156 a person for the five course set meal, which was overpriced compared to other fine dining restaurants I've had for that quality of food, but I guess it's Vegas so it's expected and everything is inflated. As we left, they gave us these nice boxes that had butterfly cookies inside, which was also pretty cool.

CHAPTER 28:  I SEDUCE A WOMAN WITH ART
I invited my sweetie to dinner at Picasso Restaurant.  Fine dining beside Bellagio's synchronized fire-hydrants while surrounded by 50 million dollars worth of genuine Picasso paintings appears to have a certain effect on women.  The coveted table #34 has the best view of said fountains.  Using the opportunity to charm my sweetie with my knowledge of art, I explained that the colorful squiggles on the dinner plates were identical to the Picasso designs I'd seen at Museu Picasso in Barcelona.  I also freestyle-critiqued a few of the paintings on the walls (secretly, I couldn't name any of them).  As we enjoyed the magnificent meal, I commented that Chef Julian Serrano is like an artist, then immediately regretted making such a banal comparison.

3908077,2015-02-19,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Picasso is the fifth Michelin restaurant that I've dined at in about a three week period. So my review may be skewed by comparisons to recent dinning experiences in Europe. 

First, the service was ABSOLUTELY IMPECCABLE. I would give it all the stars in the world for the staff's excellent decorum and professionalism. 

Two of us dined here, and we both had the prix fixe menu. First course - poached oysters with caviar, paired with a sauvignon blanc. I usually don't like cooked oysters, but this was great. The oysters were so plump and flavorful, after the first one I had forgotten they were cooked. Would definitely order it again. 

Second course- we both ordered the ruby red shrimp. We both thought the shrimps were too pungent and had too much iodine flavor. I thought about sending it back to the kitchen actually, but couldn't do it.

Main course- I had the fallow deer medallions, with a Spanish red. This dish was good, though not sure if apples were the most appropriate pairing. It was just a little too sweet to be balancing the deer meat. 

Last course: the dessert was fine--nothing amazing but I'm not big on desserts. Though I found it a bit unusual they didn't offer a dessert wine pairing. 

The food was good, and we had a wonderful evening, but I still wonder what the Michelin reviewers had to merit a 2-star award for Picasso. I'm guessing reviewers probably had the more expensive degustation menu or the special seasonal menu. Be that as it may, the kitchen should still strive to have the same level of precision throughout all tiers of its menus.

Food aside, the restaurant is lovely, being on the lakeside of the Bellagio and where else can you dine with millions of dollars worth of Picasso artwork? For those interested in looking at the art more closely, ask for a catalog or tour of the art around the restaurant.",4YgPGKtt06JuIYTQlTr58Q,3,0,3,1iGD2mAHsJZgwRgGT6Qyhw

I had a choice between indoor and outdoor seating. Chose outdoors for the views, you get the fountains right in your face. Just don't go on a windy night, because the wind will blow the fountain water towards your face. It's not like Splash Mountain status, but it makes it much colder. Indoor is also an intimate environment, you are literally in a mini art museum, and art museums generally tell you no food or beverage is allowed. 

Service was good. I was expecting them to explain each dish a bit more than telling me my first course or second course. Sommelier was very detailed, in contrast. I was able to learn more about old world wines that came with the wine pairing. 

Food presentation was gorgeous. I was expecting something more experimental. My menu degustation tasted great, but I wasn't intrigued. I'm a bit biased here, since I just dined at Twist the night before, and that dinner left me speechless, nothing but a wide grin. That had set a higher bar for Picasso to surpass.

I was shown to my table which was one row in from the windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The table was waiting for me.  There was just one chair and one place setting waiting.  

My server was Blake.  He had a great sense of humor, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion (later at dessert time), and he was there without hovering.  I noticed him approaching out of the corner of my eye when I was taking a photo and he just detoured to the next table.  When I was done, he came back.  He said I wouldn't want his hand in my photo.

I got the dégustation menu.  There was an amuse-bouche--a small tea cup with some red bell pepper soup and a pheasant croquette.  The soup was very tasty and the croquette was equally tasty.  A nice way to start.

Bread service is not the usual basket on the table.  A bus person comes around and gives you two types of bread.  This is one area that could use a little upgrading, but best not to fill up on bread so I give Picasso a pass on this point.

First course--lobster salad.  I enjoyed the taste of the ""salad"" and the plating was whimsically done.  This is really not a salad, but a dish with a mound of lobster and some micro greens, pear tomato halves, some tiny melon balls, and some whole pink peppercorns which was a delight to chew along with the salad.

Second course--One scallop on a mound of potato mousseline with a ring of veal jus.  There was one very thin, lightly fried potato slice that was bent and sticking up like a little covering for the scallop.  Excellent presentation.  The scallop was perfect!

Third course--Foie gras.  A superb piece of foie gras with some almond slices, roasted pistachio pieces (ground) and a small brioche with rhubarb filling.  The plating had one line of tangerine sauce connection the foie gras with the brioche.

Fourth course--I chose the Colorado rack of lamb.  It's not really a rack of lamb but rather was a think lamb medallion that I asked to be done rare and it was exactly the way it should be.  Again, the plating was impeccably done.

Dessert--What to get?  The dessert menu had 6 choices.  When Blake came by and I asked his advice, he pointed to two choices, both of which were at the top of my list.  He tipped the scale in favor of the chocolate truffle beignets.  Imagine three small round beignets filled with warm chocolate truffle, accompanied by peanut butter ice cream.  The ice cream was atop a small tart of rich creme that had some large pearl tapioca in it.  There was a small piece of crackled peanut butter by the tart.  This was an absolute fine ending to a wonderful meal.  Again I have to mention the plating.  This is what makes a dining experience like this memorable.

After dessert, you're given a small tray with 7 truffles.  Obviously this would be for two people.  Since I was by myself, I made the sacrifice and ate them all.  One was a miniature lemon meringue tart!  Heaven!

About the service.  There was one bus person and one waiter assigned to the tables in my area.  The bus person was always there refilling my iced tea, taking plates away, asking if I wanted more bread, always aware of the needs of each table.  When I was fidgeting with my camera bag when I first sat down, he came over and hooked it on one of those table hooks I think originally made to hold a woman's purse.  

A final note--during the meal a woman came by and greeted me and she said ""welcome back"" too.  Later I asked Blake if this was a common way of greeting guests as it was my first time at Picasso.  He said the computer had me listed as a repeat guest.  

On leaving, you're given a small box with 3 palmiers.  The box has the ubiquitous Picasso on it.  Dessert for tonight.

First, make your reservation before you go on vacation. Sometimes you can get in on the same day and sometimes they are booked for the week, so just call the Bellagio, where Picasso is located and ask to be connected. 
Second, do not go in their dressed like a slob. They will not let you in. Do not wear shorts, and I don't care how wonderful you think they are, do not wear jeans and flip flops. You will look out of place and the fact is if you are going to spend up to $360.00 for 2 people, why would you treat this event like a McDonald's? If you show up looking like you think your are at the buffet, they do have clothes they will lend you, but seriously, this is a great place, treat it as a special occasion.
You can have the prix fixe menu, but I would order what you want and be happy with everything.
Their fish is the best and the sauces that they use on everything, be it a meat dish or a fish dish are just wonderful. The soups are great, everything is great. We love their shrimp. For a vegetable have the asparagus. Skip the quail salad and try something else, it is not the best. There are other salads that are better.
They have a Lava Cake and that may seem old and outdated, but it is wonderful. Have it, you will love it. All the deserts are wonderful. I have not tried them all, I would be dead, but I have had a few and wow, just wow.
The service is fantastic and the restaurant is just stunning. You can sit indoors or outside near the Bellagio Fountains that go off every 15 minutes and dance to music. I prefer indoors, it is more quite and intimate.
Unless you are just rich, you will not be able to eat at Picasso every day. It is very expensive, so treat it like the special event it is. You will love it. Be prepared to spend about $360 for 2 people. Ya, it is a lot. If that is just too much for you, cut out the alcohol, you don't really need it and skip the salad.

Amuse Bouche: Potato leek soup with croquette.  Smooth and delicious.
Alaskan Crab Salad:  Great citrus and sweet flavors.  Micro greens was a good contrast to those flavors.
Foie Gras: I missed this since the ban in California so it was nice to enjoy one of my favorite foods.  Didn't care much for the slithers of almonds for the crunchy texture.  Rhubarb sauce was a good acidic sour note to balance the fatty richness of the tender juicy foie gras.
U-10 Dayboat scallops: potato mousseline, gravy.  Yummy.
Lamb loin: cooked perfectly.  Less gamey than the usual lamb flavors.  Good or bad depending on what you like.  I don't mind either way.  I guess when it was less gamey, you forget for second it is lamb.

Even the bread sucked, tasted like a doughy dry mess from Costco or something. I could barely stomach it. I ordered the vegetarian menu and it blew. First of all, every dish had something fried in it that didn't belong in there. The heirloom tomato salad had this giant oily, over-fried mess they called a crouton baguette. Omg, I get this giant oily mess swimming in a shallow layer of tomato sauce that tasted like Ragu but was supposed to be gazpacho. Seriously? Then I have the sauteed fava beans in pea puree. Not bad, actually and truly on par with your top most favorite baby foods. And thrown in were these fried cauliflowers that really added nothing special to my baby food. Then came the butternut squash ravioli which were completely dried out and filled with downright butternut squash and nothing else. It was the blandest most dried out pasta I have ever eaten. No brown butter or sage to speak of. I mean, what the hell? The vegetable ragout was awful with these huge bland watery beets that tasted boiled or oversteamed, and was swimming in sauce that tasted like ragu yet again! (boy, this must be Chef Serrano's favorite go-to brand!) Other standouts for worst dish ever was the dessert, the hazelnut joconde. Dear god, I've never had such a dry cake in my life. It was layers of sawdust in between decent chocolate mousse. And it was served dead cold. I felt like I got one of those cakes from the frozen aisle but no one bothered to defrost it at all. My husband's degustation menu wasn't any better and I will spare you the details but it was equally unremarkable to downright bad. The main lobster salad was bland. The scallop was decent.  He said his foie gras was overcooked at the edges but the middle was edible. The loin of colorado lamb was overcooked - he asked for medium rare and got medium-well. And it was a tiny piece of meat too - how do you get this wrong???  His Chai Tea Poached Pear was actually pretty good. The ice cream wasn't overpowering and the poached pears were delicious.

There was more than one tasting menu to choose from, so my husband and I each chose a different one so we can spread out our options. My husband ordered the Poached Oysters, Tuna Tartare, and Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer off of the Prix Fixe menu (4 courses). All three dishes were delicious, especially the poached oysters topped with caviar. 

I ordered the Menu Degustation (5 courses), which came with Maine Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallop, Sauteed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras, and Sauteed Filet of Halibut. My favorite dish of the night was the foie gras--so rich and fatty, and the mandarin confit paired so nicely with it! Unfortunately, the halibut was the least interesting dish of the night and it was actually quite dry.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The staff was quick to refill our drinks and bring out each course. It seemed a little too quick, because I felt rushed throughout the entire dinner.

4108096,2014-04-25,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"After scouring the various options before going out to Vegas, my fiancee and I decided to settle on Picasso after looking online at the menu. What is not necessarily apparent right off is that you have to request sitting outside on the patio if the weather is nice enough for it. You get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains - but from the other side of the tourists - which give it an even better backdrop with the replica Eiffel Tower, the 'Paris' balloon, and the modernist Cosmopolitan/Aria buildings. I was shocked that the restaurant was pretty empty when we came for our 6:30 PM reservation on Friday evening (and it wasn't appreciably more crowded when we left)...but the setting is in a class by itself when you are outside. Maybe you don't appreciate having your conversations stopped every 15 minutes, but it was a fantastic setting for dinner. Our servers were prompt with service, pouring water and serving the dishes in a well-timed fashion.

One of my concerns when looking at the menu was that there weren't many options to choose from for dinner. I went with the prix fixe as a result, as I felt that afforded me more options (as my fiancee did the Degustation). Starting out with poached oysters was a great choice - it's four oysters, in the half-shell, presented with generous amounts of caviar and vermouth-infused broth. I'm not sure it's quite the equivalent of how Per Se treats oysters and caviar as a pairing, but it was so delicious - the sumptuousness of the oyster paired with the rich broth and the bursts of saltiness from the caviar - and the presentation in the half-shell was very unique. My fiancee's lobster salad was also very good. It's presented much more as a tartare with a light dash of flavoring, really allowing you to take in the deliciousness of the lobster, which tasted as fresh as if it had been caught that morning in the ocean. We both had delicious foie gras, albeit presented in different ways. The torchon was really well-done, presented with a toasted piece of brioche (although thinner than I would have thought) with caramalized pineapples and a dash of fruit (I want to say it was cherry) sauce. I really like the intensity of fruit with the torchon, so I wish there was more of the cherry, but the pineapples worked as a nice contrast to the richness of the foie as well. My fiancee's foie came out in seared fashion - it really does look like a steak, given how much is served - with an intense rhubard that really worked well with the bursts of juiciness that come with each bite. Her other appetizer (the scallops) were also delicious with regards to preparation. For the entree, we both went with red meats - I with the milk-fed veal chop, she with the lamb loin. Both were cooked to perfection; I really liked the veal served with au jus, which magnified the succulent flavors of the meat.

To be honest, I forget the desserts offhand (my memory ain't what it used to be, but they were both delicious), and the chocolate chip mini-muffins given as a bite for the next morning were so freakin' good. I'd come back here in a heartbeat - not only for the view, but the food here is really good. Given that I'm sure most of the food is sourced from somewhere other than Las Vegas (I can't imagine there are many farms in the desert), I can understand the relative consistency of the menu. But everything is so well-executed that I wouldn't mind coming back and having virtually the same meal again. For the price ($115-125, depending on which menu you eat), it is a relative bargain compared to some spots in NYC, and their cocktails and wine selection hold up to snuff as well. I would've been surprised ahead of time to hear that they have 2 Michelin Stars, but after eating here, I fully understand why.",CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g,0,0,5,l5hIjLW39baVzAh1kpKTGQ
4108544,2016-05-22,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Julian Serrano has done it again. Picasso is a Michelin two star restaurant and holds up to it's standards.  I recommend inside seating which incorporates the overall experience (actual Picasso paintings inside) as well as a view of the water show.  What made my experience was our server.  I forgot his name but he was knowledgeable with the menu, brought a delicious German Riesling as well as a white wine from Sweden which complimented each dish without being overbearing.  Both dangerous if I was left alone in a room with them!   We went with the Prix Fixe which changes seasonally.

For our first course we went with the Quail Salad and Pea Soup.  The pea soup was by far a great starter with pork belly (you can never go wrong with pork belly).  

Next we went with the Foie Gras which was presented such as a ""thanksgiving"" approach with strawberry jam and croutons.  It went well with the bread that was passed out out the beginning of our meal.  

For the third course we had the Wagyu and Deer.  The deer was cooked to perfection (I believe the chef recommended medium-rare or medium?). If you haven't had deer before, I might get chewed out for saying this but it truthfully tasted like a really well prepared steak if you're hesitant.  The braised wagyu short ribs were delicous as well.  If I had to choose between the wagyu or deer I'd go with the deer again.  

For dessert I went with the warm chocolate fondant.  Trust me chocolate lovers, this is chocolate heaven!  It is also the only chocolate dessert in the selections given as they don't need to add another.

4178737,2017-04-27,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Perhaps I waited too long to come here because the food seemed too classical and not daring. Granted, chef Julian Serrano's award-winning restaurant is nearly 20-years-old and I did try to visit in 2001, but was told the restaurant was closed for a private event. Not that the food was bad or dated, but it took time for me to adjust to the traditional French refinement instead of bold creativity. When sitting down to eat at Picasso, think ""attention to detail"" to get into the right mindset and ask after every bite, ""Can I taste the essence of each ingredient?""

The cooking is not about big flavors, but subtle clarity and detailed execution. I imagine that the kitchen is filled with immersion circulators to cook the food to the exact degree. Vegetables like innocent little carrots that were precisely between crunchy and soft or beets just tender enough to cut through, but not more.

The flavor profiles were not about unique or clever ingredient mash-ups, but traditional combinations like foie gras with apple or veal with potato. Even when straying from French into German cuisine, the deer loin was served with a tangy red cabbage slaw.

This is not fatty French cooking where butter and cream are the main ingredients. Fats coat the palate which block the ability to taste the spirit of each ingredient. The asparagus and morels came with a cream sauce, but it was very thin instead of heavy which allowed the vegetables and mushrooms to shine. The spring pea soup was more like a pea broth than a thick veloute - again to let the pea flavor become the center of attention. Even the dressing on the warm quail salad was fantastically light instead of heavy with oil.

Instead of dislocating a shoulder while hoisting the enormous wine book, I opted for one of the two convenient wine pairings (the cheaper $63 version) for the three savory courses. The pairing was a journey around the world with great explanations by the sommelier. The conservative pairings were consistently light compared to the food. The approach is the wine should be subordinate to the food. Boldness was neither for the food nor the wine.

Although the waiter was flippantly confident that our 7:00P reservation would allow plenty of time for a 9:30P curtain of ""O"", he was wrong. We arrived at the show on time, but had to rush through the petit fours and hustle through the casino.

The dining room was decorated with not just one Picasso painting, but many works using different mediums. Probably not a seat in the house that didn't have at least two Picassos in view. The one wall without artwork was the glass doors with a view of the dancing Bellagio fountains.

The attire is dressy with jacket preferred, but good luck enforcing that in Las Vegas. It's too bad. There are only a few times when playing ""dress up"" is encouraged - prom, red carpet events, and Vegas. Seize the opportunity instead of being too (casually) cool for school.

The restaurant is located downstairs from where the shopping area and the casino connect. Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime Steakhouse is next door. The simplest menu selection was four-courses for $118 with three to six different selections per course.

On my next visit to Vegas, I hope to slip into the bar for barrel-aged cocktails while gazing, not into my girlfriend's eyes, but at the large Picasso painting. Hey, she'd do the same thing.",yz0s55qwi_WqVjmbyZ9ICw,1,0,4,AEhfZU2neXFa2jsWRDr7qA

When you hear the words 5 course meal, you think of a lot of food....forget it, we each had small cups of butternut squash soup, 2 tiny pieces of bread, one tiny goose liver that was ""not my cup of tea"", four pieces of lamb that were no bigger than 1 1/2"" and paper thin, and a tiny lava cake w/a scoop of ice cream....there was one more thing and I can't even remember what it was.

I dined at Picasso in October 2006.  I was at the Bellagio for a convention and decided to give it a try.  At that particular time the chef was featuring a five course Alba White Truffle Menu, in which every dish featured these little treasures.  The meal was $300 and I splurged and purchased the wine pairings for an extra $150.  It was well worth it.  It was so memorable that I saved the menu.

The first course was a warm potato Vichyssoise with steamed leeks and potato gnocchi, paired with a 2001 Franz Hirtzberger Pluris Grauburgunder Smaragd.  The second, and my favorite course, was a creamy arborio risotto with jus de veau, paired with a 2003 Jermann Vintage Tunina.  The risotto was just unbelievably creamy and pleasantly pungent.  The third course was butternut squash ravioli with a 2004 Yves Cuilleron, Les Chaillets.  This was my favorite wine of the evening.  The fourth course was a prime filet mignon with a 2001 Bodegas y Vinedos Alion.  Then, the dessert: caramel orange bread pudding with poached Bartlett pears, muscat syrup and pear sorbet, paired with a 2003 Vaickenburg Madonna Eiswein.  Soooooo good!

The ambiance was sophisticated and elegant; I particularly enjoyed admiring the original Picassos that adorn the walls.  The service was impeccable; I particuarly enjoyed our somellier and his vivid descriptions of each region where our wines came from.

I just can't think of a better combination of fantastic food, outstanding wine, and first-rate service.  As you would expect at the Bellagio, Picasso is not for the faint-of-wallet.  But it is worth every penny.",a2MmRp6bRUHmVTuY3DMsBQ,4,2,5,eaE7eKnzZT9M2wFZ-XtT-w

I had the prix fixe menu.  I had oysters with caviar (excellent, the caviar complimented the oysters wonderfully), boudin of lobster/shrimp/scallops (disappointing, shrimp overpowered the dish), fallow deer (excellent, the best dish of the night), the cinnamon apple tart (there was too much cinnamon).  Below are some tips at nice restaurants based on silly customers i watched:

1) DON'T ASK FOR MEAT MORE COOKED THAN MEDIUM-RARE.  They are going to give you the crappy meat.  When you overcook meat, you are not judging the meat quality, it all tastes the same.
2) ASK THE WAITER FOR GUIDANCE.  They know the entrees, they will help.
3) PUT YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE.
4) Ask the waiter where different meats come from.  It is a good differentiator to make yourself sound intelligent.
5) The wine pairings are essential on menu degustation or prix fixe meals.  Trust in the sommelier.",NUyMCIlRHqZ6BvgtVPXqZQ,2,2,5,AcAEG8P2FB-kdxUPuX5rkg

I think I may have hyped myself up for it a bit too much because I figured 2 stars would be way better than 1 stars (I've only been to 1 star ones up until now).  

We had a prix-fixe 5 course meal which included lobster salad, scallops, foie gras, lamb and some sort of chocolate torte dessert. 

The lobster salad was absolutely delicious and we were off to a good start.  Scallops were good too.  I'm not the biggest fan of foie gras but this was actually made quite nicely.  The lamb was a bit too cooked for my liking - apparently medium rare is hard to ask for (and I specifically say more on the rare side).  The dessert - I don't think I can write a fair review about because I was beyond full by that point.  But it was very pretty to look at!  

Overall, service was great and ambiance was good but a bit noisy.  They give you a souvenir box with some chocolate chip muffins at the end (which were nothing special).

4329947,2011-06-19,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I was fortunate enough to come here for a friend's wedding reception.  We were seated on the outdoor patio as the sun was setting, so it was warm, but no longer scorching.  From the patio, you get a gorgeous view of the famous Bellagio waterfall shows, and sometimes you get sprayed with the mist, but the hotel was considerate enough to delay the water shows when it got windy - solely to keep the patio dry for us.

We had the entire patio, which was perfect for 30-40 people.  It was very private and beautiful, and it seemed so much quieter than the rest of the Vegas madness.

With the champagne service, my glass was never empty.  Passed appetizers included a pheasant croquette that was crisped just right, smooth inside, without any gaminess.  The tuna tartare with mango was buttery and fresh, served on a spoon.  There were also mini chicken skewers and beautiful poached oysters.

The first course was an ever so lightly dressed lobster salad, topped with microgreens and with small avocado balls.  I usually try to avoid dressings, but the apple vinaigrette highlighted the lobster well.  It was paired with a dry Riesling that was just right for seafood.

Next was an Alsatian Pinot Gris matched with a perfectly seared U10 sea scallop, served over super light potato mousseline, with a rich veal reduction underneath.  

The 3rd course was a foie gras over a decadent piece of pound cake, with a sweet peach sauce to cut the grease of the foie gras.  I probably wouldn't have chosen a sauterne to match it, though, as it was too syrupy early in the meal.

An alternative was tender lettuces with tomatoes and a textured avocado base on the plate - it was nice to have a lighter option, especially if you don't eat foie gras.  I really appreciate how accommodating they were to my dietary preferences.

For the mains, I tried the Australian wagyu filet and the roasted lobster tail.  The wagyu was perfectly medium rare, topped with hearty mushrooms.  The lobster was so sweet and plump and perfect, I could have eaten at least 2 of that dish... and I didn't even notice the salsify until the end.

To end, we had delicate petit fours in addition to the wedding cake, and we each had a little black box of pastries as a favor to go.

Chef Julian Serrano even came out to chat with us, and I saw him visiting with other tables, too, which is so nice, since so often, big name chefs either aren't at the actual restaurant or they don't care to come out.  The sommelier is a James Beard finalist, and he was the most charming and unpretentious, approachable sommelier I've ever encountered.  Of course, service was otherwise impeccable, with napkin folding, utensil placement, opening doors and stepping back for you as you walk by...

Michelin stars, AAA diamonds, Wine Spectator awards - all well deserved.  Needless to say, the best wedding food I've ever had... and one of the best stand alone meals I've had.",gfyW0vuJls8ARoHmogfcmw,3,2,5,GKiUOS3DcWDY_avNWb7Bdw

The red was too young and tannic and the white was thin, yet shrill and might have been open too long.  Dessert was lovely, but by that time we had to wolf it down because we were running late.

Regarding service; we asked to be finished by 8:15 in order to make a 9pm show across town. We thought two hours would give us time for a leisurely paced meal.

I could probably end my review of Picasso right there with that one statement of a word. But... let's get some more food-porn style descriptions going!

Since I came with a partner in crime, we each ordered a different menu (one Prix Fixe and one Menu Degustation) and decided to share and conquer.  

First dish to come out was a lovely amuse bouche of a fried potato croquette with serrano ham and smoked red pepper soup.  Everything went together perfectly... the crispy, sweet potato croquette combined with the smoky, salty serrano all dipped in the sweet, deep red pepper soup.  Great start!

Next came the appetizer dishes.  

The Maine Lobster Salad was light and refreshing and a perfect start.  The acidity of the vinaigrette allowed the briny sweetness of the lobster to shine.  

The Pan Seared Scallop was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sear on the outside and fork-tender inside,  all accompanied by delicious whipped potatoes, a Parmesan chip and a rich sauce.  

The Sauteed Ruby Red Shrimp was cooked just to the verge of doneness, so that it retained a lot of natural flavor and crunch.  Accompanying it was a delicious Piquillo Pepper Vinaigrette and tomato confit.  

The Sauteed Foie Gras Steak was butter... and the peach sauce complemented the richness of the foie gras extremely, helping to cut down on the heaviness of it.

The highlight of the appetizers (not to take anything away from all of those listed above because they would put most other restaurants to shame) was the Poached Oysters.  OH MY LORDY!  The oyster was perfectly poached.  The buttery vermouth sauce, combined with the briny caviar and a splash of lemon for acidity... its like ""sex in the mouth"" (sorry I was just watching Top Chef and that phrase was used).  If I had to die tomorrow, this would be one of the things I would request to eat in my top 5.

Finally, the mains.

The Halibut Fillet was again, cooked perfectly (it's getting boring I know).  The outside had a nice crisp while the inside was perfectly flaky.  The rich Hollandaise sauce was a perfect compliment to the light flavor of the fish.

The Milk-Fed Veal Chop was delicate (weird word to describe beef, I know).  The veal was tender and a perfect perfect medium rare.  What else is there to say?

So after all of this, the desserts came.... and both the Chocolate Truffle Beignets and Berry Buttermilk Cake are awesome (sorry, exhausted from writing the above so no more detail here).

Dinning at Picasso is highly recommended, if you are into fine dinning, don't put up with crappy services, and want to feed your temple the best.  Picasso was superb and exquisite.  To celebrate my baby sister's special weekend with all five of my sisters, I wanted nothing short of perfection.  This is their first time dinning here.  Originally, my first choice was Joël Robuchon as I had such an amazing experience there, but I couldn't get in.  I made reservation here back in September 2014 as a back up.  Glad I did!  Make your reservation early(period)!
We were lucky to have had a table overseeing Bellagio fountains and surrounded with Picasso's artwork.  The ambience was elegant, intimate and fantastic.   Michelin starred food commanding a view of the fountains and Vegas, it was truly indescribable.  We all had the prix fixe menu and it was excellent.  My first course: poached oysters with caviar was out of this world!  I had to remind myself to come up for air as I couldn't stop myself from devouring them within seconds.  The 2nd course: Fois Gras de Touchon, high quality smooth  fois gras served over toast and huckleberry reduction; I love this dish, it's quite rich and buttery, as if you are eating pure steak fat dipped in European butter!  The main course was the braised wagyu short rib, it literally melted in my mouth the minute it touches my tongue.  Then the desserts, my god!  I had the Chocolate Torte, I am not a sweet person, but it was so decadent and nicely presented.  I couldn't resist taking more than one bites.  The service was top notch; our servers and sommelier were awesome!  When we left, they handed us a nice orange box with little muffins.  It was one of the best meals we all have had.

BF and I had reservations for 6:30 pm since we had tickets for 9 pm to watch Le Reve at The Wynn afterwards. I had requested to sit in the patio but due to the rain with the seats being all wet, they had to close the outdoor experience to us. Aww...such a disappointment on that part. That would have been a BIG bonus. We were seated right away, but too far from the window to watch the water show. Boo! The lady at the front said it takes 3 months in advance to request patio seating but the girl over the phone told me it's first come first serve...hmm, well which one is it? Inquiring minds want to know!

But on with food! We chose the Prix-Fixe menu. It's a four course menu. Funny, they don't put the prices down on the menu though but just know that it means you better have lots of money! Or plan on washing dishes for days! Although, you get what you pay for, worth every penny!

There are lots of different items choose from. While we waited, they kindly served us bread, three to choose from. French bread, raisin bread, and olive bread and Picasso butter to go with it. We chose one of each! Served warm and fresh. 

For starters, I had the Poached Oysters and it had caviar. First time having it. It was wonderful! BF had Warm Quail salad, it was crispy and tender. Very good! I had the Big Eye Tuna Tartare which was good. Haha I'm not gonna lie, I was expecting some fried Wontons to go with it though but I guess the chef didn't think it needed it. 

BF had the Foie Gras. You bite into it and it's like butter! Seriously, that's how the texture is...like butta baby! If that's what you like. Foie gras is supposed to be a delectable food meaning ""fatty liver"" of a duck. It was quite interesting. But it was good!
 
Main course...I ordered the Roasted Milk-Fed Veal Chop, BF ordered the Roasted Maine Lobster. Funny thing, we both disliked our own dish and favored the other so we of course traded! Like we always do. Next time we should just order for each other. I guess he expected something different from the lobster. I love seafood! I just don't like paying an extra $30 for it, and since he doesn't mind, then I don't feel bad for eating it if he doesn't like it! Haha works both ways and it doesn't end up a waste! He preferred my baby calf. It was too gamey for me, I guess. And I love meat! This was my second time trying veal. First time I had it on a cruise, and I immediately threw it up. I'm done! No more chances. Veal is on my banned list. BF loved it though. He said it was soo good! Good! I'm glad! Cuz I didn't like it! 

For dessert, we had our own Banana French Toast. Glad we didn't share it and glad we didn't pick two different things so we can taste the other options because it was out of this world! The flavors all mixed together just exploded in my mouth! So many different bursts of flavors! Tasted like the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich ever! It was sweet goodness! Omg, we both enjoyed this dessert soo much! Nice way to end the meal. 

Walking out, they gave us a little favor to take home with us, a little Picasso box with mini chocolate chip muffins. And the hostess was nice enough to take our picture in front of Picasso's painting.

Great customer service! The waiter always refilled my water. They were all very friendly and always smiling.

This was the most fun and romantic two hour meal, with a very nice ambience, the most expensive but well worth meal we've ever had. Like I said, it would have been even more amazing watching the water show, but hopefully next time. 

This whole short weekend getaway was super super fun and an unforgettable memory that I will never ever forget. Thanks to my BF for an incredibly, mind-blowing, jaw dropping experience! Loved it!",q-vOzqBhd6xdn6pimq8peg,3,1,5,_evCMCJYBgCZF1fl_QcxIQ

The service was harried yet slow (if that makes sense). It seemed as if the wait staff was trying to interact with us as quickly as possible. It was if they were saying, ""We've done this before and the food is really outstanding so I don't really have to take my time to make you feel welcome"". They were relatively cold and impersonal. Our waiter did warm up later but by then we didn't have any interest in talking to him. They were VERY slow in getting the food out. I know this is a french restaurant but even the french can read body language and ours said ""We don't want a two and a half hour meal"". Didn't work!

A few head scratchers, though. the bathroom was not spotless (at $140 a plate, you better have your bathroom spotless). I could have sworn the were playing The Backstreet boys in the restroom???

EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE
Sadly, this style of service and elegance is very rare to find in these days of 2017. 
Maitre'D and supporting hosts, Sommelier and wine stewards, Captain (and a true one at that), under-waiters, runners, waterers, bread men, busers. 
Making out this list I guess it is not too far from staffing in many other places, but so rare to find the *coordination*, the elaborate communication, the attention to detail and timings to the second. 
It makes all the difference in the world, although if they're doing it right, you don't even notice: by the end of your meal, you are just sitting gracefully in bliss as the flavors continue to titillate the palate. At Picasso you are also looking out at the Bellagio pool and enjoying the water show.  

# I wouldn't be mickobizzle if I didn't find something to improve on:
## runners *always* messed up the plate for our vegetarian diner, always giving him he wrong plate. It was like they were picking on him, mocking him for refusing to rip the flesh of each dish's beast, so blatantly brandished in his face!

WINE LIST OF THE AGES
You might expect (and I *do*) a wine list of ""death"" that would crush the cellars of most of the world's restaurants, especially here in Vegas. Picasso doesn't disappoint. 
For me tonight we had bottles of:
+ the tip-top bottle (and so glad to show my colors of favoritism) in Maison Tattainger's finest preparation, the Comtes De Champagne, this one from 2006. 
+ big bad bold bruisy Heitz Cabernet from 2011. 
Yeah I know it's a bit boring and standard, but I know none of these folks have had it, so there. 
+ a sweet and pure, fresh and creamy, silky Montbazzilac 
with our desserts. (Should have ordered it for that monster-sized fois gras)

ART OF THE AGES
Well, it is called Picasso so you might imagine that being Bellagio they would have multiple largest-format-he-painted original oils throughout the dining room. Multiple tens of millions. Magnificent.  

BUT IVE MOVED ON!! THIS FOOD IS ALSO FROM ANOTHER ERA. 
I no longer crave the heart-stopping all-butter-and-cream recipes of those days (early '90's) and certainly not in *every* one of the nine courses!
* delightful pheasant croquette amuse bouche filled with cream sauce and accompanied by a side shot glass of savory and creamy cream. 
* lobster salad. Wow what a portion! Piles and piles of delicious, luscious, rich lobster meat!
(For some that could have been a meal, but we are just getting started!)
* scallop with mashed potatoes and a rich meaty (beef stock?!!?) gravy, garnished with truffle shavings (xomg riicchh!) for a $supplement
(Dude I'm full.)
# sauté of fois gras. Not one but *two* ginormous pieces of the world's most decadent meat. Preparation was warm sear on the outside and cold-like-butter inside. Not for me. I like it one way or the other. And I wanted it to be seared to the point of almost melting.

4413810,2017-02-24,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Our prix fixe dinner here was good but not amazing. What immediately stands out is: 
1. Awesome, attentive service
2. Beautiful view of the water show through the windows
3. How unbelievably long the dinner was. By the 3rd (out of the 4) course, we were already so tired of eating and had been at the restaurant for 2+ hours. True to the French roots, food comes out at a really leisurely pace. I had wished we lied and said we had a show to catch, because by the time we were done with dinner, 3 hours had gone by. 

My family tried the Seasonal Truffle menu the last time they were here and said it was 100% not worth it so we all opted for the regular, 4-course menu. 

1st Selection: 
A. Poached oysters were a favorite around the table - no complaints! 
B. The Warm Quail Salad was more quail than salad, and I'm totes happy with that ratio! It comes with 4 pieces of quail, all beautifully roasted for a crispy skin. Plus the meat is wonderfully juicy. I'm not a fan of oysters, so the salad was a happy alternative. 

2nd Selection: 
A. Foie Gras did not live up to expectation. Really generous portions, but we were expecting actually a piece of the liver. Instead it had more of a pâté texture and was pretty average in terms of seasoning. It came with some slices of apple pie and was more of a sweet than a savory dish. 
B. Big Eye Tuna Tartare was refreshing and pretty straightforward. It was a simple dish of tuna, avocado, and ponzu-like sauce that was more Japanese-inspired than anything else. It wasn't mindblowing, but it was definitely fresh and a light alternative! My family actually enjoyed the tuna tartare more than the foie gras, which really doesn't say much since they were both pretty mediocre. 

3rd Selection: 
A. Salmon was generous and perfectly cooked. It was just the right amount of fatty salmon + lean salmon meat, with a crispy skin on top. Super happy with this! 
B. Veal Chop was just alright and honestly not something we would ever order again. It was underwhelming in its unoriginality. 
C. The Deer was actually the winner of the night! Super tender and the flavor was just so on point! Rich and bold, without being overwhelming. Plus the accompanying green apple was an A+ complement! 

Dessert: 
A. Apples + Cinnamon Crepe - definitely pass on this! I regretted ordering this so much. The crepe is a thick, tasteless texture and the apples were overwhelmingly sweetly baked. 
B. Poached Pear was pretty good, especially if you like your pie crust! It had a layer of crust underneath that made it resemble a pear tart! A little too sweet for my taste. 
C. Pumpkin Bread Pudding was pretty good too. A good option for those looking for a mixture of textures - there's the soft gooey bread pudding + ice cream + crunchy cookie complements. 
D. THE WINNER = Pineapple passionfruit tart. A nice tart, tart! Refreshing and definitely does the pineapple justice with its sweet and tangy theme! Also the accompanying lemongrass balls were a nice touch that broke up the fruity sweetness of the dessert.

Overall, I honestly don't think our prix fixe menu was worth the price tag of $100+/ per person. Some of the dishes were good, but they weren't THAT good. Would not recommend unless you're looking for a long dinner (with a view) with a variety of dishes, and price is not a consideration.",WMLrJpSqeQU9us9FTKJFew,5,1,3,DBEuKbN0h98ald2f5p0jEQ

Food: 3.5 stars
Service: 4.5 stars
P/C: 3.5 stars

I went to this restaurant on a number of times and the most recent was at the end of July (but my review is really cumulative).  There were two of us - my and my girlfriend.  I called in ahead of time to request for the seat that would have the fountain view and...we got it!

The restaurant was pretty empty right at 6pm when they first opened for dinner so we got all the attention from the servers that we could ask for.  We got a bottle of duval-leroy paris collection to celebrate.  one of us opted for the degustation menu (5 courses) and the other the pre-fix menu (4 courses).

In the appetizer section - we got an assortment of the poached oysters with caviar on top, pan seared scallops, pan-seared foie gros, foie-gros torchon, and main lobster salad.  Frankly, nothing was memorable.  The seafood dishes were well executed and nicely seasoned but nothing that wowed me.  The foie gras torchon was very nicely executed although I believe that the pan seared foiegras was a bit over done (bordering tough).

For the main course, I got the veal chop and my girlfriend the halibut.  The halibut was once again...well treated and executed but nothing more than an average.  The veal chop on the other hand, was awesome - it was tender, very well seared and cooked to perfect medium for my liking.  It was the highlight of the night.

The desserts - I got the chocolate fondant cake and my girlfriend the melon three ways.  Nothing too memorable either.  If a two-star restaurant can't move me in the dessert area, then there's a problem in my opinion.  

Now onto the service - we couldn't have asked for a more seamless and courteous service from the floor staff.  They were never intrusive and kept their light-heartedness and cool the whole time.  We were there for over 3.5 hours and they were perfect. 

The maitre d' on the other hand - I don't know what the hell was wrong with her.  Woke up on the wrong side of the bed?  Had a fight with her boyfriend/girlfriend?  Ate something that gave her a constipation?  She was monotone and not happy.  Having beautiful eye lashes and walking on her pretty skinny legs may be one qualification but maintaining a professional and absolutely courteous demeanor is THE qualification.  Maybe I should have slipped her a $20 and maybe things may have gone better.  


The decor - awesome.  Dining with millions of dollars worth of picasso pieces...just freaking great.

In conclusion:  If they can really kick it up a notch with the dishes and replace the maitre d' that clearly needs metamucil, I'd love to return to this very special joint!!!",9qyLpg3JTVUZXS4XrQgZkQ,2,2,4,XKcUBuwj4Z6CqP7NDMhYHQ

We weren't opting for the wine pairings for dinner, so we had cocktails.  I ordered a vodka tonic, and my buddy ordered a Makers Manhattan.  The drinks were fabulous, these guys take all aspects of your dining experience very seriously.  After pouring my friends Makers Manhattan, he noticed a microscopic sliver of ice that made it into the drink, immediately poured it out and made another.  My drink was equally as awesome, which had a splash of freshly squeezed lime juice.

The hostess was absolutely gorgeous, and the rest of the service, impeccable.   I opted for the 5 course, which consisted of a Maine Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallops, Sauteed Foie Gras, Roasted Lamb and a Chocolate Fondant for dessert. In addition, a cold corn bisque with a side of boiled quail egg and smoked salmon was served before the first course, which was amazing. The combination of quail egg and salmon was a perfect pairing.

For those that care, the restaurant is on the fountain side of the Bellagio, has a notable collection of authentic Picasso's, and has a great ambiance. Also- given the quality of the food and service here, the prices are quite reasonable, the 5 course as described above was around $120. The place isn't pretentious at all, and they're not dress code nazi's, though diners are well dressed for the most part.

Once you walk into the jaw dropping Bellagio, Picasso's not too far away. As soon as you walk in you'll be greeted by inspiring and regal artwork, that could probably make your jaw completely fall off if you knew its market value. These types of paintings litter the entire dining area, which is truly a reason to visit Picasso alone. It's got to be one of the worlds most expensive art galleries, all wrapped into a wonderful restaurant.

I generally really enjoy a prix fixe menu and trust that the chef will serve a uniquely set up series of thoughtful dishes; however, this was just blahhh and heavy. Each course was a protein including foie gras (which was very good) however, by the third course, I was getting full and wanting something more refreshing. By the last course, everyone at the table seemed to be over it. 
 
Everything was expertly prepared, however; each dish lacked any sort of wow factor (besides the lamb dish - it was memorable). Seabass second course on prix fix menu was also very good. Lobster salad was also pretty tasty. However, Seabass main course on the other menu was bland and very boring. Deer dish on prix fixe menu was also uninspiring and boring. I usually love deer and was excited that i found it on a menu; however this had no unique flavor what so ever and just tasted like a drier and thinner cut of grocery store beef.  

Desserts were hit or miss. Cheesecake and pear pastry were both just ok - edible. No one in our party finished those dishes. Chocolate dessert was incredible - best thing we ate all night. 

Service was also blahhh. Couldn't understand server because he mumbled so we didn't get any of the dish explanations. Never interacted with us or made any special effort to be accomodating. It, like the food, was just underwhelming.

I was pretty disappointed because I had really high expectations for this place from all the awesome reviews from diners and critics alike...perhaps, that is why I feel so let down.

Picasso isn't your everyday restaurant, as suggested by its prime waterfront location in the gorgeous Bellagio resort.  The authentic, multi-million-dollar Picasso artworks adorning the walls are another giveaway that you're about to experience something spectacular at Chef Julian Serrano's flagship restaurant.

I visited Bellagio on a Saturday evening, armed with 5:30pm reservations.  The hostess was incredibly gracious and gave me a window seat overlooking the lake.  Perfect for front-row viewing of the half-hourly fountain shows.  The clientele skewed toward a very specific demographic -- mostly older Asian businessmen on dates with their (much, much younger) girlfriends or trophy wives.  I didn't really fit in, but I didn't let that faze me any.  After flipping through the encyclopaedic wine list and settling on a glass of Sauvignon blanc, I was all set.

There are several menus to choose from, including vegetarian and 4-course prix fixe menus. However, I decided that ""go big or go home"" would be my motto for the weekend, so I opted for the 5-course degustation.  This includes an amuse bouche at the start of the meal and petit fours at the end, so it's really a 7-course extravaganza.  Absolutely everything about my dining experience was phenomenal, and I'm still reminiscing over it with fondness:

**AMUSE BOUCHE**
A shot of slivered almond soup with a pheasant croquette.  The soup was silky smooth, which contrasted nicely with the slivered almonds.  The pheasant croquette was crispy and light.  Both were packed with flavor.

**COURSE 1**
Maine lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette.  Very fresh and complex.  Loved the addition of cantaloupe spheres.

**COURSE 2**
Pan-seared U-10 dayboat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau.  Imagine the most perfectly cooked scallop you've ever had, sitting on the silkiest, smoothest, creamiest, and most decadent mashed potatoes you've ever come across.  That's *almost* as good as this dish was.

**COURSE 3**
Sauteed steak of foie gras with toasted pisatachios and poached cherries.  Rich, luxurious, and amazingly cooked.  If you're feeling indulgent, you have to try this.

**COURSE 4**
Sauteed filet of halibut with asparagus and Hollandaise.  This was probably the most traditional and straightforward dish of the night, but it was executed flawlessly.  Loved every flavor about it.

**COURSE 5**
Pears poached in chai tea with panna cotta and chai tea ice cream.  The perfect ending.  A strong chai flavor connected all the elements.  Loved how the warm pears intermingled with the cold ice cream and perfectly textured panna cotta.

**PETIT FOURS**
A tray of delectable handmade candies that included chocolates, jellies, truffles, and meringue.  Every single one was to die for.

After dinner was over and the check was paid, I felt so blissful that it was struggle to get up and leave.  But that's okay, because Picasso gives you a little something to go!  In my case, it was a gorgeous gift box with two individually wrapped mini muffins -- perfect for a breakfast snack the next morning.

Service is incredibly professional and gracious, with a whole team of servers tending to my table.  However, it was my server, Mitch, who really shined that day, making sure that every course was perfectly paced, every water glass was full, and every crumb was swept away between courses.  Another amazing surprise was receiving an email a few days later (from the general manager, Kelly M.) thanking me for my patronage.  I'm so blown away by a restaurant that cares so much about its guests.

What a night!  I don't know when I'll be back to Picasso, but I hope it's really soon.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,6,2,5,e0FTrgv7HHXzGU0u6cA1WQ

There are beautiful, colorful, fragrant flowers everywhere. The place smells heavenly with the combination of all these flowers. In combination with these are the artworks adorning the place - painting, drawings and sculptures of, of course, Picasso. Then you add the wonderful view to the Bellagio fountains - wonderful!

We sat outside patio and the moment I got seated I had  bad feelings..I was right.

There were lots of branches and leaves on the table fallen from the tree. Our servers looked like ex janitor and homeless men picked up on the Strip. Don't they have a dress code for guests?? Why not for servers??? Their service wasn't too bad but wouldn't you expect a clean, classy and sophisticated looking server at this level of restaurant??? 

Our server (his name was Jose I think) wasn't bad but sometimes he didn't listen to us well. He left before we were finished talking to him. 

We got  Menu Dégustation.
First 2 courses were very good. Very refreshing 
3rd course Foie Gras was ok. a little too fatty not smooth

For 4th course, I got lamb. I didn't like the sauce. The lamb was cooked perfectly and it was very tender but it had an awful smell. I couldn't finish. To be honest, I never really had lamb before but I wanted to try to see if I would like lamb or not. I tried it at this supposedly fancy restaurant and didn't like it so I guess lamb is not for me. If you love lamb, I'm sure you would like it here. It was prepared well. 

Dessert was VERY BAD. I got disappointed because I saw nice photos of desserts on yelp and was looking forward to it. But none of the desserts on the list sounded good to me. I got Poached Pair with Ginger icecream......big mistake. It was so bad I couldn't eat at all and had to switch it with something else. I don't remember what its called. It was alright. 

I shouldn't have sat on patio. The view wasn't as good as I thought and I've seen the water show millions of times. I missed out all those million dollar Picasso arts. 

4 and half stars out of 360 reviews convinced me of coming here with high expectation but it's so sad that I didn't have the same experience as others. I grew up eating Kobe beef...(authentic, not the ones raised in US) I don't think I have bad taste in food...

4607444,2014-01-01,4,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"We had a phenomenal meal here!  I rarely do tasting menus because there are quite a few things I don't eat, but the degustation menu here lined up really well with my tastes.  It's 5 courses, plus bread, an amuse and mignardises.  I've had bigger meals that I was able to finish, but the food here is so heavy and rich I was stuffed by course #3.  

The degustation menu is:

Amuse bouche - a cup of potato leek soup and pheasant croquette.  Both the soup and the croquette had wonderful flavor and texture.  Great start to the meal.

1st course - Maine lobster salad.  This was one of my least favorite courses, simply because I don't really like mayo.  However I realize mayo is an important part of lobster salad and I think this course was objectively very good.  I loved the apple-champagne vineagrette and cherry tomatoes.

2nd course - Pan seared U-10 scallop over potato mousseline with veal jus.  This was tied with the foie for my favorite course.  Scallop was cooked perfectly.  Potato mousseline was amazing (like mashed potatoes but with a better flavor and thicker texture) and veal jus had great flavor and was the perfect complement to the scallop and potatoes. There was also a delicious crispy potato chip-like thing stuck in the potato mousseline.

3rd course - Sauteed steak of foie gras topped with toasted pistachios and served over dried quince and quince sauce.  This was a really big highlight for me, coming from California where foie is banned.  The foie was smooth and buttery and had a perfect flavor.  The sweet quince was the perfect pairing and the crunchy pistachios provided a nice texture contrast.  The piece of foie was HUGE too.  Definitely the best foie steak I've had and tied only with Jean-Georges' foie gras torchon for the best foie I've ever had.

4th course - Choice of halibut or lamb (or wagyu beef for a huge supplement).  I had the halibut, my husband had the lamb.  This was probably my least favorite of the courses, probably just because I was getting full and it was a less unusual thing.  Still the halibut was cooked well and I loved the creamy sauce on the asparagus (the asparagus themselves were too thick for my liking).  The portion was big and I could only eat about half of it because I knew I had to save some room for dessert.  My husband liked his lamb.

5th course - Dessert. You can choose anything from their dessert menu (about 8 options).  I had the warm chocolate fondant with banana caramel ice cream.   The chocolate cake was excellent, I wasn't as big a fan of the ice cream (I though the combo was weird and I probably would have preferred plain banana or caramel ice cream).   I was also stuffed beyond belief.  I brought half of the cake home and it reheated pretty well the next day.  My husband didn't really like any of the options so he asked for and was given plain vanilla ice cream.

Mignardises - An assortment of about 6 treats, including a dark chocolate ganache candy, a chocolate truffle, a white chocolate truffle, a meringue, a jelly, and a little fruit biscotti.  We had to take these to go.

Farewell gift - A really nice Picasso box with two banana chocolate chip mini-muffins for breakfast the next day, and it was given to both of us, not just me.

Overall,  we got a LOT of food and I really couldn't find fault with any of it.  Some courses blew me away more than others, but nothing was bland or prepared incorrectly.  It was really an A+ meal from start to finish.  I loved the ambiance and decor of the dining room, with real Picassos on the walls (they encourage you to photograph them!) and, even from the inside, a nice view of the Bellagio fountains, which went off about 8 times during our 2 hour meal.  Service was really excellent as well, although I was a little surprised they didn't ask about allergies (we certainly could have brought it up had we wanted to).

4616033,2011-09-06,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Be ready to spend $500 on dinner for two, but it is worth EVERY single penny.  Everything about this dining experience was perfection and absolutely stunning! It is easily the most beautiful, romantic dinner you can take someone.  I compare my experience to how I felt right before the intermission of the Broadway's musical Wicked. I savored every second and never wanted the experience to end. The taste and intricate plating of each dish was so astoundingly thoughtful and delicious.

We enjoyed our degustation menu inside the restaurant with real Picasso painting worth $85 million dollars displaying on the walls.  For our dessert and wine, we sat outside on Bellagio's private balcony while watching the Bellagio fountain show up close. Words cannot express how incredible and gorgeous the view was. 

The Degustation Menu is $123 a person with recommended wine pairing for an additional cost of $63. The sommelier did a wonderful job explaining each wine's history and how its flavors complimented our dishes. You can actual taste how intricately each wine flavor complimented with each sip and bite of each dish.

First course was a Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette. The taste was carefully crafted and beautifully plated. The lobster was so refreshing and had a light and flavorful bite. This dish was like heaven in my mouth.

We then received our amuse-bouche which was red bell pepper soup and a croquette. It was supposed to be a starter that came before our first dish, but we received it after our first course. Minor oversight from the restaurant. 

Second Course Pan Seared U-10 Day Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau. The scallops were seared to perfection on a bed of potatoes.  Richer and heavier than the first course but very tasty.

Third course was Sautéed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras with roasted Peach-Thyme Pound Cake, Almonds and Riesling Peach Coulis. I never wanted this dish to end. Every bite of it was thoughtful, from the light sweetness of the poundcake to the creaminess of the foie. I savored every single bite of this dish.  Easily the best tasting Foie Gras I've had yet. Our favorite dish of the night.

Fourth course, I went with the Filet mignon and my partner chose the Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb. We both agreed that the Lamb was tastier than the Filet. All of the ingredients on the lamb dish complimented each other wonderfully. The filet was tender but was lacking some flavors and wasn't my favorite dish of the evening.

For dessert, we sat outside on the balcony and we watched the Bellagio fountains up close and under the night sky. We went with the server's recommendation of Berry Buttermilk Cake and Warm Chocolate Fondant. We liked the buttermilk cake more than the warm chocolate fondant. It was more special and tasted a bit lighter. After our dinner, they brought us out extra desserts on a silver platter compliments, of the chef.  When we left, they also gave us cookies in a gorgeous Picasso box to enjoy.

Overall, it was an amazing experience that I will never forget.  I cannot begin to put into words how happy we were with our experience and I highly recommend dining here if you are in Vegas.",e4CCD4D7iA4SCxryHNtzUQ,4,1,5,pbFXtXxoG-ZAVUTc8ikVvQ

Here's what I ordered:

1) The butternut squash soup was a perfect balance of hearty, savory, creamy, and slightly sweet. The presentation with the marshmallows and mushroom bits was fantastic.

2) The foie gras tasted like butter, delicious meat butter. It was complimented by a sliver of toast and a plate of sweet and crunchy fruit. 

3) The Kobe beef fillet was melt-in-your-mouth good with mushrooms and a moat of reduced red wine sauce surrounded by mashed potatoes with a dollop of horse raddish. I'm salivating just thinking about it. 

4) The dessert, which was a chocolate bonbon surrounded by a whole plate of goodies, was to die for.

And the little somethin' extra: As we were chatting with Roger, our amazing waiter, we mentioned that we were seeing Cirque du Soleil's ""O"" at what we thought was 10:30. His face looked a bit worried and he informed us that the show was at 10:00. It was 9:55 and we hadn't gotten to our dessert yet. Without a hint of irritation or disdain, Roger saw to it that we received our dessert and the bill as quickly as possible. We felt so bad that we had to rush out, because the experience was one that is best when you take your time. 

Oh yeah, and if you sit by the windows, you can watch the Bellagio fountains. It's been almost a week since we ate there and I'm still thinking about the food. Well done, Picasso. And thank you, Roger, for being awesome.",bVo-RV_wY8ZEcfi0aiFqcA,0,0,5,6yjw10EfaynIDnmHbXbG-Q

I made reservations for the BF's birthday and requested to be seated near the window to watch Bellagio's water show. We were right next to it and saw it every 15 minutes for like 2.5 hours! 

It's a beautiful restaurant with amazing decor. Everything was so pretty! It has a very romantic and upscale vibe, so make sure you come nicely dressed. The BF had the degustation menu and I had the prix fixe menu. Both were REALLY good. I'd recommend getting one of each so you can sample the most variety of food they have. (BTW they had a special five-course menu with truffles that was $300... that I will come back to try when I win big!). My favorites were the poached oyster, the Maine lobster salad, and the Tai snapper (which unfortunately had a fish bone in it). I don't like foie gras but the BF loved his. He also upgraded one of his entrees to a Wagyu beef (+$40) that he said was well worth it.

Dessert was as good as the rest. I had a grape panna cotta and he had a slice of key lime pie with peanut butter ice cream. They went out of their way to make his dessert extra special for his birthday, and also presented a platter of petit fours (that we enjoyed the next day). On the way out they also give you some cookies (wrapped in a fabulous box!) to take home. 

Overall it was a memorable experience. I'm giving a 5 stars even though there was a fish bone (the BF said he would have to give it a 4 because of that). That's how much I liked it. Service was a little slower but understandable because it was a full house. It is a pricey dinner (ours, without drinks, was around ~$350) but I think it's worth it. Put it this way, I'd rather eat home for a couple (and a couple more!) meals and save up the $ to come here once.",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,4,1,5,GuyvPZwYhzFyhgVDPdHktw

Decor: they have a great collection of Picasso painting and if you into arts it a treat. you get to be up close and personally to enjoy the painting. the ambiance is classy, open and very romantic. 

service: from the minute you walk in they make sure everything is to your liking and everything that you ask them to do when you make your reservation. Our Server is very knowledgeable about wine and help us make a great selection for wine (Riesling -Schloss Schonborn 06) its one of the best Riesling i ever tasted. Normally for a young Asian dude come to a place like this they kinda looking on your and try to serve you, but here its a different story everybody is a VIP and they are there to serve you. 

Seating: I recommend sitting next to the Bellagio Fountain so you will see the water show without interference. Our dinner start from 6:30pm and lasted about 2hrs. I was hoping to go enjoy dinner and watch the sun set and as the night turn darker and the water fountain show come on it the most romantic place you can be.

Food: We both go with the Prix entry (right side of the Menu) The oyster is awesome it the best oyster i taste in any restaurant up until now. Next i have the sea bass it was just right and cook to perfection. the right amount of Salted and sauce make it an enticing appetizer. for my main entry i have the Kobe beef ($125 extra) money well spent. it's medium rare and it was they best meat i ever ate. if you never have Kobe, you need to try it. It's the most tender and pamper meat there is, every bites is like butter in your mouth. mang.... I want to eat it again now. hahahaha

Also, the Deer is delicious too.... I know what you thinking deer? at a place like this! but they have it and sooooooooo goood. 

Desert: The Sorbet... it is the best out of all the desert they have on the menu. 

Overall: this place is gonna cost you (guys) so be prepare to dig deep in your pocket. I won $1500 so this dinner is free to me, but our bills come out to just under $600, this because we also buy a bottle of wine from them. so it's a great place to enjoy Vegas with the view of the fountain @ Bellagio and you get to be King or Queen for 2 hrs. hahahaha",-loj3ptOYImY3DnD6GYvLA,0,0,5,9PAknn_yDWj5jFAFFE_qxA

The art is beautiful, and the view of the fountains is great. I like to think of eating dinner here as more of an experience than anything else. You will be treated in a way in which no other restaurant will treat you as the service is so personal. This, however is a typical ""fancy restaurant"" in which the food is on the smaller side. This is not a place you will walk out full as the serving sizes are just not enough in order to do that. However, the food was quite good. For my meal, I chose the quail salad, which was more of just quail rather than a salad. There were micro greens, but not enough to make a salad in my opinion. The quail was very good. It tasted oven fried. Seasoned very well. My second course was creamy asparagus. This came with an odd type of mushroom on top. I'm not a mushroom person at all, but these were amazing. The flavor and textures of this dish were done very well. My entree was the lobster. This was the least impressive of the plates I chose. There was not much depth to this dish. It was lobster with a type of creamy sauce with a few kernels of corn on my plate. I think some type of starch would have went well with this dish so to me, it was underwhelming. The mister got a lobster salad, which he said was good, scallops, which he loved, but there was just one. The foie gras steak, which he surprisingly liked, and the lamb. He was underwhelmed with his main course as well. He didn't think it was that flavorful. Overall this was a great restaurant. Yes, we have had better food, however the food here is really good, just not blow you away good. However, I like to think of Picasso as an experience, and for that, it is a 5 star experience.

The bus boy came with bread a selection of 3 breads and all were warm. The sommelier noticed me reading the wine list and was quick to come to our aid. He help my wife and I and made some suggestions, when we explained that only my wife was having wine and what she like he asked if he could make a selection for her to which she agreed, and she loved the wine he selected.
 Dinner itself was amazing. We had the chef menu. They brought us an amuse which was a chilled leek soup with a grouse croquette. WOW is all I can say, flavors explode in your mouth
 1st course was Lobster Salad with Apple Vinegar. I am not a lobster fan at all but if you made it like this every time I would eat it all the time.
 2nd course was Pan seared Scallop. Perfect, lightly seasoned and cooked just right, there was a light translucent center.
 3rd course was Foie Gras. Nice sixe portion and a crisp crouton served with fresh black cherries, so good and lucky me my wife is not a fan of Foie so I got more
 Main course, my wife had Halibut and totally enjoyed it. I had the Wagu Filet for an up charge but it was so worth it.
 The desserts were amazing. My wife had the black berry cheese cake and I had a Hassel nut chocolate cake.

 This is so worth going and we will go back but a word of caution this is price, don't mean to offend anyone but it may not be for everyone.",yv430in7Z0zUk59LVBKSqw,0,0,5,7deR1lMhdNrxGrv3L53qTQ

Directed menu's that will please most palates. The Quail we had, cooked to perfection and very well balanced. Then we had the foie gras that was tasty, perfect temp. And also well balanced. I would have avoided the bread below and maybe done something different.. Then the Deer.... Rare and awesome. I did specify that all my meal should be without pork, and the preparation that went along had bacon.... So 1 less point for them!! Other than that,  This place did it! 
As for wine, this place has an extensive wine list with huge bottles and hefty prices.... We were glad to have Michael Schwab as our somelier who directed us to a 5/5 bottle of wine for the price tag we were willing to pay. Thank you Michael.
For desert, I always talk about my feeling that a chocolate desert is always good... That is the safe way to go... If you really want a desert that will blow your palate away, generally it will not be with chocolate.... So today I put the chef to test and ordered a cheese cake with earl gray ice cream. Wuau. The earl gray portion was amazing... The cheese cake I would balance different as the bottom crust is oreo... Would have preferred something more exotic. Espresso was creamy and well done.

It was one of those violent flashbacks... you know, the ones in vibrant technicolor that almost brings you to your knees.  Last time I experienced something like that, I woke up in some back-alley in Saigon covered in peanut oil and bean sprouts... but I digress.

When preparing for our Vegas trip, wifey made sure to request a window-side table overlooking the gorgeous techno-fountain at the Bellagio.  After all, if you're gonna eat at this now iconic Vegas landmark, you'd better get an up-close and personal view of it.

The space is quite large and tastefully decorated.  It's elegant, but not stick-up-your-ass stuffy.  Make sure to wander around the restaurant in between courses to check out their Picasso collection.

Service was what you'd expect for a Michelin 2-star establishment... they did a nice job kissing my ass.

We went with the tasting menu for the evening and were not disappointed.  It was an orgasmo multi-course event for the ages.  After about 4 courses, my mind started to warp like those crazy Picasso images you always see.  The clocks began to twist and melt, a bouquet of roses exploded from wifey's chest, the sommelier's face twisted into an almost unrecognizable and amorphous mass of teeth and eyeballs.

If you can't tell yet, we had a lovely dinner.
We even saw the Bellagio fountain show exactly 10-1/2 times during our meal!!

Still recovering from jet-lag as I write this review. My first time dining here was about 7 years ago, and this time would probably be my fourth time, but first time reviewing it...sigh! 

I'm lucky to be able to fly on a private jet within 24 hours without dealing with LAX issues. Nevertheless, I decided to dine here while taking care of biz matters...multitask. 

Had the concierge make reservations and was seated at a VIP booth with a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain. There are tables on the patio and by the window, however, evidently diners have complained about getting wet from the dancing fountains, and so I was glad the hostess was accommodating. The wine list was impressive, but I prefer french champagne and had the pre theater menu cuisine of: lobster, duck l'orange along with micro veggies. Both the lobster and the duck were in splendid sauces, quite delightful. All the dishes were exquisitely prepared and presented, just like art, just as it always been every time I dine here. 

This restaurant and the cuisine and style reminds me of NYC's Le Cirque and I am so glad it is still here, I love elegant classy dining experiences, and Picasso is.

Speaking of art, the restaurant exhibited numerous paintings on all the walls. The most prominent and priciest is the self portrait of Picasso which was acquired for over $48.5 million  in 2006, and is probably worth more now. I am amazed that something that valuable is just on the wall of this restaurant...but I suppose it's insured, of course!

The restaurant is elegant in decor, lovely ambiance but lighting was dim, which was romantic but didn't help with pics.  Perhaps the dim light helps preserve the artwork on all the walls. The Bellagio Hotel has been on the Las Vegas strip for decades and it is known for the Bellagio Gallery of art collection.

I've been to many fine dining restaurants as my frequent work trips to Europe with luxury hotels has my standards very high and I often am hard to please with these type of establishments. Picasso did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in, we were welcome by the hostess and seated quickly. Regarding that little hiccup mentioned - unfortunately, we were initially seated in the back corner by the service table, which we weren't pleased about. About asking for a different table, the staff quickly seated us in a much better location, which eased our experience a bit but left a bit of a sour impression. 

All of that sour impression was turned around by our amazing waiter, Blake. He was not only knowledgeable, but he was very personable and funny. He made the entire experience 1000x better as he made us laugh and made the service so seamless. The staff was also on top of keeping our drinks full and offering us bread once our plates were empty.

The food was divine. As all has mentioned, the poached oysters were amazing. Salmon was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior, while the deer was exquisite. We also ordered wine pairings and it was perfectly paired with each course. 

The Citrus Bombe was my favorite course and I had paired with a cappuccino. I am a cappuccino snob as I've had many great cups, but this was cappuccino was quite nice.. Overall, great service and great food.

I ate here about a year ago and have only recently gotten around to writing reviews of all the restaurants I've been to; however, Picasso was first on my list. It's tucked away in a lower partition of the Bellagio, so it's easy to pass up on a quick walk-through. 

We were seated at the outdoor patio overlooking the pond. This gives you one of the best views of the water show to be had on the strip. However you won't be able to view any of the artwork of the restaurant's namesake. If you walk around inside you can see many of the original Picasso works from several periods. 

The staff was extremely polite and attentive as would be expected from a Michelin two star restaurant. The patio's head waiter was spot on for all of our needs.

I ordered the tasting menu and both of my friends opted for the vegetarian prix fixe. The somollier suggested a Riesling, so we ordered a bottle. He knew what he was talking about because it matched well with both my dinner and the vegetarian plates. Good job!

My amuse bouche was a lobster soup that was smooth and silky.  The U-10 seared scallops were large and perfectly cooked. The foie gras however was mind blowing.  My tongue was crying with joy and at the same time hated me.  I haven't had any before nor since that caused me to get emotional. The seared halibut was also fantastic and seated over a ragout of mushrooms. When dessert came we loved their presentation and the taste. I had a molten chocolate cake that oozed with goodness. My friend Liz had some some of strawberry... amazing... something rather. I wanted to steal it, but her glare let me know that this was not the place to start a fork battle.

Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to cap off a trip to Vegas. For three of us with wine, the check came out to be around $650, so budget accordingly.

It was one of the best meals I have ever had, comparing with 2-star Michelin rated restaurants in Italy and Spain.  We ordered the 5 course tasting menu, which cost around $110.  We brought two bottles of wine, so it ended up costing a little more, but the corkage was only around $35, so it was worth bringing in our own wines.  We had bottles of wine that we had been waiting to open for two decades, so we appreciated that Picasso did not try to charge $50/ bottle or simply not let us bring it in at all.  

The story I have heard about Picasso is that when Steve Wynn was opening up Bellagio, he asked Julian Serrano, who at the time was the Executive Chef at Masa in San Francisco, to come and open up a restaurant in his hotel.  When Serrano politely denied the offer, Wynn decided to ""go all in"" and offer to decorate his restaurant at the Bellagio with $30 million worth of Picasso paintings and other artistic decorations from Picasso.  Being a Spaniard, Serrano could not refuse this offer, and opened up ""Picasso"" at Bellagio.  It has been one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas ever since it's opening.  

Our meal was worth every penny, including all the fine things in life such as Lobster, Caviar, Foie Gras, and Lamb.  Every dish was well portioned (not too small, not too large), and we left very content.  All of the dishes were a wonderful fusion of Spanish and French, which defines Julian Serrano's cuisine.  The lobster was perfectly cooked, the Foie Gras was some of the best I have ever had, and the Lamb was also perfectly cooked.  

I am not one who will give 5 stars to any nice restaurant. In fact, I am very picky when I pay this much (over $100/ person) for a meal.  Julian Serrano came through with an amazing meal, and Picasso came through with the decorations... or should I say Steve Wynn came through.  Either way, I'm very glad Steve Wynn knew how to get a Spanish chef to come to Bellagio.

Buffalo Trace mixed with who knows what else, I was too distracted by the amazing art. On my first sip, I knew it was a winner.

I was told that patio seating was the way to go, but little did I know that I'd be getting a table that overlooks the Bellagio fountains, which went off in a spectacular show no less than six times during my meal.

Being in an ambivalent mood, I went with the taster menu and asked for a recommendation for wines aimed at the front and back half. First up was an amazing croquette that was soft and crispy, with the most amazing side of potato leek soup, chilled. It was paired with Serrano ham, and was a perfect entry point for the rest of the meal.

There was a lobster salad that, as a Mainer, I can say was as good an execution on the ingredient as I've ever seen. A beautiful scallop dish that was absolutely perfect. My entree was lamb and it, too, did not disappoint.

They also filmed parts of Ocean 11 here too, so it does look familiar if you've seen the movie. And although this is fine dining, you don't get the pretentious feeling like some restaurants in Paris.

So yah...we went with a couple of 100 dollar bottles instead...the Ruffino 2003 chianti and the Faust 2007 cab. Both were very nice that complimented everything throughout the night.

For a quick starter, they served a potato leek soup with a skewer of quail egg, salmon and caviar. Great starter. Just drink the soup straight up and the skewer was nice and cold and very fresh.

The first course from the d'egustation menu was the Maine Lobster salad. Nice, cold, fresh with avocado and with a little tanginess from the apple champagne vinaigrette. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=ZsCBs6ZyIx0c-hFK1OpRfw

Next was the pan seared U-10 day scallop. Yes...scallop...singular, but it was divine. Fatty goodiness melting in your mouth, with a potato puree  and a small amount of jus de veau (broth). So small, yet it will take you a half an hour to finish it because you will just want to savor it again and again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=HC4f8kFjLVsaWpKzdR8g1A

For the next dish, I substituted the Foie Gras and went with their sauteed ruby red shrimp. Three pieces of shrimp that came with zucchini, artichoke, tomato and a pepper vinaigrette. Again, only three pieces of shrimp but the quality was superb. Small, but somehow it was just the right amount. The presentation was very nice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=SFq-KEMsNJxloUEuJzJRTQ

For the main entree, I chose the roasted Tournedo loin of Colorado Lamb. The alternative is the sauteed filet of halibut. My lamb was cooked medium rare, very juicy, tender. It will make you go WOW. So again, savor this for awhile so your WOW can last longer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=19MjcpPDcwLUVWrtGseWAw

For the finale, I went with the berry buttermilk cake. It's a panna cotta, with raspberry syrah soup with strawberry ice cream. Very yummy with the hint of syrah wine that gives it a little kick. Great way to finish the meal. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=LUOd5bR1tAh1qqGsUDJ1fw

Service: 3 Stars
Atmosphere: 5 Stars 

To sum it up, not memorable. For a Michelin two stars restaurant, the experience was beyond underwhelming. I scheduled this dinner for a duo birthday celebration for my friend and myself. There's quite a few things that went wrong last night. I think it is pretty embarrassing for a high class world known restaurant like this. Maybe I came the wrong since chef Serrano is not personally overseeing the place last night. 

I ordered the Degustation tasting menu, and my friend order the prix fixe menu. We tried each other's dishes. We agreed that most dishes were good but not amazing. We liked his signature scallop the most. Besides this dish, I also like the lobster salad and halibut. Again, those were good but forgettable. 

Here's the parts where it went wrong. A friend stopped by and chatted with us in the middle of the dinner. They didn't care to ask her if she would like to order any drinks. They finally gave her some water till 30 minutes later. Then, it was the main entree of my friend's wagyu short rib. I honestly don't know how it's called wagyu. The meat wasn't even as tender as it should be but the problem was the seasoning. It was like someone added an extra bag of salt to piss the chef off. We asked to send it back, and got another one without sauce. The manager came out and apologize. I appreciated that she personally brought the second dish out. However, it was still so salty without the sauce. We came to the realization that it was in the marinade. We sent it back and swapped to the lobster. Honestly, I personally think it was quite embarrassing for the restaurant if I had to send back the dish twice. Not to mention, this is a Michelin two stars place. The lobster that was replaced was much better. 

Since we were celebrating the birthdays, I was disappointed that our server didn't offer to take any pictures for us till we asked. Then, where the service fell short was that a friend of mine knew the time and place when we had dinner sent the birthday cake for the restaurant to bring out for us. At first, I thought it was from the restaurant to compensate for the short rib since the server did not say anything. We were like oh that's a nice gesture till I soon found out it was from my friend. So basically, the restaurant almost took credits for the cake by not saying anything. I was speechless at this point. 

The atmosphere was great as most of the restaurants in front of the fountain. I appreciated the paintings as well. It's a really nice place to come for a celebration if you are not a food snob. 

Like other yelper had mentioned, I will return to Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon for French dining in Vegas. Not anytime soon for a place with underwhelming services and food.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,8,2,3,c-qYJ89ghoYgrkQsgiL34A

However, they manage to keep the excellence in service and food. We had a 5:30 pm reservation since we had a 7:00 show (LOVE at the Mirage). We were escorted to their terrace in front of the fountains. It was absolutely GORGEOUS. The day and the view. 
We told our waiter we were in a time crunch and needed to be outta there by 6:45pm. We both had their 4 course pre-fix menu. Started off with a glass of bubbly. I ordered the mushroom soup (AMAZING) and my fiance the poached oysters which came with a sauce and caviar. BEST OYSTER I've ever had, even better than Le Benardin's. Second course was a the Chilean sea bass(I forget what kind) and my fiance had  the FOIE Gras. Although my sea bass was a little bit overcooked, it tasted okay. Foie gras wasnt the best i've had but top quality. Third course, we ordered two glasses of wine and we had the Veal and the Deer. Both excellent as well.

Dessert was delicious. But the most amazing thing was, WE MANAGED TO HAVE AN AMAZING MEAL, in an hour and 15 minutes. They were so kind to pace the service in a way that was not rushed but also aware of our time constraints. They were kind about it. Our waiter (French guy who has been working there since 1998) was one of the best people I have ever encountered in the service industry. He even went above and beyond to take us outside and get us in the cab. I wish restaurants take note of how important service is. It makes me feel okay about spending $500 in a one hour meal,because the service and the food were that great and worth it!

4926592,2014-09-11,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"We dined here last night, on a bit of whim.  We had tickets to see Cirque's ""O"" at the Bellagio, and went over to the Bellagio early to see if we could grab some dinner prior to the show in the hour and 15 minutes we had.  I had read about Picasso before we went to Vegas, with it's 2009 Michelin stars. . .  I knew I wanted to try it, but I figured you would need 1.  a reservation and 2.  more than 75 minutes.  I was wrong on both accounts.  We were immediately told we could be sat and finish prior to our 7:30pm showing of ""O"".  They also informed us we didn't need to get to the theater early since we already had our tickets, we could show up at 7:30pm on the dot and be fine ( and we were).   Okay back to Picasso. . . 

We were led to our table, and it was then that I realized the Picasso not only has Picasso's all over the walls, but also overlooks the Bellagio lake and fountains!   Um, yes please!   Piccasso only has 2 set menu's, we went with the pre fixe menu that was $115, and then we also added on the wine pairings, which were all SPOT ON.   

First course I got the poached oysters, and my husband got the warm quail salad, both were divine, but my oysters were life changing. . .and I normally don't like cooked oysters, I like them raw, but these were off the chain.  

Second course, I got the sauteed ruby red shrimp and my husband got the foie gras. . .both were very good, the foie gras being a little bit better though.  Although I liked the lightness of the shrimp, as the foie gras was so rich (as it should be). 

Third course, I got the lobster (which costs $40 extra), and my husband got the Fallow Deer. . . they were so different and both so excellent.  My lobster was fantastic and my husband loved the deer.    My dinner ended up being much lighter than my husbands, thank god.  

For dessert, I got the earl grey cheesecake and my husband got the cherry tart, both were very very good, but I do think the cheesecake was the winner.    

We were sent off to our show in perfect time, and they gave us a little box on our way out as a gift, inside were two chocolate chip mini muffins.  I enjoyed them for breakfast this morning.   

Final verdict, this was a top 10 lifetime meal for me, I wish we had more time, and could have sat out on the patio closer to the fountains. . .ahhh, next time!   Thank you Picasso!",qf1o6G5jie6Y_Yc1ReraQA,4,2,5,d0fuDkd6CZ7hwwFG80-ULA

Overall, I would say that it was about what I expected...not less, not more, and I say that in a positive way.

Unlike some other Vegas upscale restaurant, it was quiet, subdued, and great for a special occasion dinner.  We were seated at a small table next to the window where we had a great view of the fountain.

I had the tasting menu with wine pairing and wife had the prix fix menu.  

My tasting menu was lobster salad, scallop, fois gras, and I selected lamb for the main dish.  The service was impeccable, and the food was excellent.  I do agree with some other reviews that their menu seem to stay quite....eh...stable for some time.  I think it's nice to have their signature dishes, but I would think that renewing a menu for each season is a good idea to attract repeat customers.  

since the portions are quite small, I was first worried whether I might get full, but I was VERY full at the end.  They also went out of the way to change my wife's main dish to something else as she wasn't quite thrilled with her choices (as she has some food allergies).

Overall, I had a great service and food, just as I thought I would received and made for a memorable night.  Was I blown away?  No, but I've eaten at a quite few Michelin starred restaurants in many countries so I don't get blown away too easily :D",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,2,0,4,poqj0iVo7L7_hJd19aJ2jQ

Located next to the Bellagio fountain that makes excellent view and ambiance.  The restaurant is flourished with Picasso art and has a beautiful display of floral arrangements.  It felt comfortable and inviting.

Our table was located 2 tables away from the glass windows facing the fountain.  The food selection was limited, but each choices sound delectable.  

Price per person with drinks can be about $150+ per person. 

My favorite dish was the poached oyster for my appetizer.  It was delicious.  It taste like heaven.

We did experience something that was a little bit upsetting which was receiving a piece of plastic in my husband's foie gras pate.  It was the last bite in his appetizer course and we had told our server.  They had offer to get him something else but we didn't want anything more as our entree was coming.  They did take off the tab for that appetizer.

The dessert was a bit disappointing and we thought it was too sweet.

We did enjoy the restaurant and the staff.  Would like to come back again when I am in Vegas.

I had the four course pre fixe:
- First, they were totally on board with my celiac disease restrictions.  They said they would make anything (aside from a couple of desserts) gluten free.  So no restrictions on what I could or could not get on the menu!

5040944,2017-07-06,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"This meal was $207 for myself. Picasso is super expensive. That being said, the food was world-class.

I opted for the Degustation menu. This includes bread, amuse bouche, Maine Lobster salad, Seared Dayboat Scallop, Foie Gras, Colorado Lamb Tournade, Chocolate Bread pudding, and petit fours bites. 

The olive bread and baguette were lackluster. I actually prefer the gourmet bread from my local grocery store. The bread was cool, tough on the bite, and lacked flavor, moisture, and seasoning. 

The amuse bouche was a quail croquette with chilled corn chowder. The croquette is a fried stick of quail with cheesy sauce filling. Alongside the corn chowder, this was a soulful entry into the meal. Lots of savoury flavors to prime the palate. This dish was not a palate cleanser as many amuse-bouches. 

The Maine Lobster salad was excellent. Cool chunks of fresh lobster packed with a light vinaigrette, shrouded with delicate bitter greens, light onions, and a very subtle hint of black truffle that lingers effervescently on the palate. The dish tastes quite fresh and is a nice movement from the amuse bouche to lighten the palate. 

The scallop was the texture of cold butter with the taste of meaty seafood. It was deeply seared and served over a potato puree. The dish was lovely. 

The seared foie gras was a standout. This is the best method of serving foie. The outside holds a deep crisp while the inside is buttery and deeply unctuous in a uniquely poultry-offal manner. The black cherry glaze and deep crunchy bits on the plate balance out the soft mouthfeel and fatty savour of the foie gras. This is a combination of flavors that cannot be replicated with any lesser ingredient. 

The lamb tournade was just OK. The mouthfeel was slightly tough. The lamb's exterior did have serious maillard charred complexity. Is wasn't too impressed with the flavor of the meat or it's texture. 

The chocolate bread pudding was like a light brownie. The plate many interesting and complex bits of flavor. 

The meal was finished with some small bites from the kitchen that were pleasantly sweet and soft. These encompassed several flavors on the sweet/salty/bitter spectrum. 

Picasso is an amazing environment with good, but not impeccable, service. The interior is beautiful and it is set on the lake of the Bellagio with fountains gushing every 15 minutes.

The venue is nice as you have art to look at and/or the Bellagio fountains as a view. The seats were a bit close though. I can hear other peoples conversation and it was a open room so a large boisterous group overtook the room.  

I went for a different menu than my husband so that we may try bites of each others dishes. Nothing was bad, but few really stood out on terms of execution. The best for me was the roasted squab as the preparation was spot on and allowed the meat to be showcased. The foie torchon was also buttery and lovely. 

My main issue was pace. We had 4 courses and we had about 30 minutes between each course. My hubby and I can talk for hours, but even we got a bit restless to the idle between things and I was SO over sitting here after 3 hours. This is the first time I've done a course meal of only 4 dishes that took as long as dozen at their other French cuisine peers. 

The other was the old school service from our main waiter. ""What will the lady be having?"" is a question to ask the lady dining. They chatted up the husband a bit, but never once included me into the conversation. All the questions were directed at the husband only. Our server knew we were local, knew what my husband did for a living, and places we've dined at. I hand the check with my card, the bill was handed to my husband. I do not understand this type of formal sexism. I didn't feel like this was a place that lived up to a standard of wonderful service because the service was only for one of us. 

There were little things I did like. As you leave they give you a small box of cookies and the hosting staff was very welcoming coming in as well as out. The bussers were all very friendly and attentive.

5070868,2018-06-12,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"If I could give a restaurant six stars this would be a six star review. I have dined at Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, at Robert Curry's Auberge du Soleil in Napa, and Thomas Keller's Per Se in New York City.  Our experience at Picasso was better than than all three.  Dining is a synergy of ambiance, cuisine and hospitality--as with all beauty--the sum of her parts.  Like the Picasso's that grace her wall's this restaurant truly has je ne sais quoi.

The hostess was beyond helpful, assisting my bride with her gown.  Their Restaurant Manager David was warm and friendly, like an old friend.  Our waiter was engaged yet professional, and the assistants were all on point.  Now, to the cuisine.  Wow!  Julian Serrano is truly a Master Chef.  I have worked for Kevin Taylor of Denver, Pierre Padovani of Honolulu, and I currently work for Gordon Ramsey.  So, I fully understand the attention to detail that is required at this level, and Picasso has it all.

I love raw oysters, for me it's all about tasting the sea the same way one tastes the terroir with wine.  Typically cooking an oyster will detract from the natural flavor.  Chef Serrano lightly poaches the oyster retaining the natural sea salts yet adding a comforting warmth to it's delicate texture.  Each is finished with a generous dollop of caviar that's literally bursting with flavor.  In the center of the plate is an intricately carved Meyer Lemon.  Again, attention to every detail.

I typically enjoy Prime Beef when I go out.  When I discovered that Picasso is taking the high road--not that safe middle of the road by being, essentially, just another steakhouse--I thought about doing the Sea Bass.  My wife ended up ordering this succulent dish and it was perfectly crisp on the edges with a soft warm flake to the center. 

I went with the Sautéed Medallions Of Fallow Deer, Medium Rare.  There was no gamey nature to this red meat what-so-ever.  The flavor and texture could be described the same way one would compare a Cabernet to a Pinot Noir.  I consider it a more nuanced and melodic, less-bold and brash, alternative to prime beef.  It did not feel heavy at all but was filling and very satisfying.  Each medallion was adorned with a delicious cranberry compote and finished table-side with a zinfandel reduction.

I personally would have paired Orin Swift's Mercury Head Cabernet with these but, it being our wedding night, we optioned to not even open the wine list.  That being said our bill, after a glass of wine at the bar (sitting at the feet of an original picasso) was an even $300.  This is an absolute sweetheart deal considering that our meal also included a delightful amuse bouche, a plate of ruby shrimp (in addition to the courses mentioned above), and was finished by two of the most beautiful hand-crafted desserts you could imagine.  Each plate was painted with congratulations, in chocolate, and the finale was a little silver platter of sweets.  

As Las Vegas locals, I would rate The Bellagio's Picasso as the #1 restaurant in our city, perhaps in The World.  We were seated right against the window and my wife--who moved here from London with The Royal Ballet 20 years ago and was Celine Dions's Ballet Director for many years--finally saw the Bellagio Fountain explode to ""My Heart Will Go On"" in it's entirety.  It is truly amazing what absolute treasures can exist right in our own backyard.

I requested a new table and was moved to a much nicer one for 4 were we could sit next to each other.

The roast lamb was also nothing short of amazing as it was buttery tender with a caramelized glaze on the outer skin of the roast. Avocado and Lobster salad was light with sweet springy meat. My neighbor had the main lobster ($40 upgrade) and I looked over with food envy. 
Desserts were absolute works of art visually. My chocolate lava cake (don't remember what they call it there) was good though a bit on the sweet end in my opinion, but most people would love it. 
We were there for a work function and service was good overall. We did feel they seemed a bit too anxious to make sure our dinner guests knew there was a $250 white truffle option, or to point the top end wine selections... my CEO and I were a bit turned off about that detail. But, that's all in the perception I suppose... generally the dinner was a success.

I devoured every bit of it. For my main course, I ordered the wagyu beef. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. Dessert we decided on the hazelnut cake and the poached pear. Hazelnut cake was good, but the poached pear was fantastic. It was light, not too sweet and was a great ending to our evening. For cocktails, I highly recommend the Blueberry Pomegranate fizz vodka.

5159791,2014-01-15,5,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Two words: OVERRATED and OVERPRICED

Julian Serrano you disappoint me.  I had high expectations of Picasso (in the Bellagio), especially since I read such amazing Yelp reviews.  However, my experience was anything but. 

Since they were booked for the week of new years, we were only able to score a reservation for NYE. I was a bit disappointed because that meant that we would have to spend an additional $35 per person for the same menu they serve on regular days. 

Service: 
Upon arriving, the hostess told us our table was ready and sat us at the table farthest away from the water show.  Even upon asking to be moved, we were not moved and the place was close to EMPTY!! At first I thought it was because they were solidly booked up for the evening, but throughout our meal, we saw that most of the tables were open. For a restaurant with an amazing view, I saw none of the water show. This was extremely disappointing!  

When our server came to introduce himself, we asked a few questions about the dishes and he didn't really know much about them. When asked for suggestions, he just said all of the dishes taste good.  For a 2 Michelin star restaurant, I expected the service to be amazing and the server to be knowledgeable about the dishes and be able to give us some suggestions.  This was not the case.  

From my past experience at Michelin star restaurants, when our dishes came, the server would explain a little bit about the dish and what we were eating.  This didn't happen at Picasso, instead they just put the food on the table.  In addition, Michelin star restaurants are known for their service. We had crumbs on the table from the bread and food and they never came over to clean it up.  Moreover we ordered lemonade for a drink and they never came over to ask if we wanted a refill, bring out another one, or even take the glass away, just left the glass empty at our table. 

What drastically hindered our fine dining experience was the photographer that Picasso hired for the night (or maybe its every evening).  The lady came by each table to take photos and asked for our name, hotel, and room number.  She told us that she would deliver the photos to our rooms after our meal.  I was annoyed that she interrupted our first course, but since they were going to deliver the photos to our room, I thought why not.  Only this was not the case. The photos were NOT free. She came back after we received our main course and told us that the photos cost $140 for the package (2 portfolios of 8x10s (four 8x10s) and 2 portfolios of wallet sizes (four wallets)) or we could purchase each 8x10 portfolio for $40 and each wallet portfolio for $25... adding it up it would have been cheaper to purchase each portfolio separately rather than get the ""package"". Our photos were very unprofessional and were crumpled so we did not purchase them.  I handed it back to our server and asked him to tell her we did not want it.  She then came back (interrupting our dinner for the third time) and asked us if we were to purchase the photos.  I had explained to her that we had given it to our server and would not like to purchase them.  She asked why and kept badgering us to purchase them.  Never before had we had such an awful experience at any type of Michelin star restaurant being interrupted so many times during dinner and then badgered and guilt tripped into purchasing photos we did not want. 

Food: Although I had read reviews about how amazing the food was at Picasso, ours was only mediocre.  

What I ordered: pan seared u-10 day boat scallop, sautéed steak of ""a"" foie gras, prime filet mignon, and hazelnut joconde

What my friend ordered: Alaskan crab salad, kobe spheres (some kobe meatballs in a lentil sauce thing), roasted milk-fed veal chop, and tropical napoleon

My main course was the Prime Filet Mignon and I asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was cooked to medium.  The filet mignon lacked flavor and was very dry. I had to ask a few times before they brought out any sauce.   I ended up eating only a few bites and couldn't finish it because I was not enjoying it at all.  

After being bothered by the photographer, we didn't want to eat our dessert and only finished part of it because we were so annoyed. We didn't even get time to enjoy the Picasso art!   We came here to celebrate graduating from graduate school, but left highly annoyed and upset.  

Our dinner cost over $400 and we left extremely disappointed.  I would not recommend Picasso to anyone, unless you want to spend big bucks for mediocre food and service.  For such an expensive meal, I  much rather would have spent it on several meals elsewhere.  We've been to Julian Serrano in the Aria hotel and greatly enjoyed our experience there more. It is 1/5 of the cost and the servers are much more knowledgeable and friendly, plus we were never hustled for photos or bothered throughout our dinner there.",BK3Jt6vp8iIxbX9Wl6YPeQ,12,2,1,IVBSqnFuq4i7BLTbP8JLLA

The excitement of vegas is echoed by the bellagio fountain show, but the chaos is muted by the dark lighting and impressive picasso paintings.  It's like watching the world from inside a a fishbowl.  You know, a fishbowl with picassos.

My wife and I each ordered the menu degustation with the standard wine pairing.  The sommelier informed us that the premium wine pairing comprised of wines that were more scarce, but certainly not superior.  We decided on the standard wine pairing which was stupendous.  i appreciated that the sommelier not only described each wine, but also described why each wine was chosen as the compliment to each dish.  that was special.

The first dish was a small lobster salad with an apple -champagne vinaigrette...very plump juicy and fresh morsels of lobster in a light sauce.  every other bite brought a surprise crunch of peppercorn that spiced up the lobster and added another dimension to the sweet shellfish and sauce.

The second dish was a pan seared day boat scallop.  this dish was a show stopper.  every element of this dish enhanced every other flavor.  the scallop was seared just perfectly, melting in my mouth yet maintaining the bounce of a fresh scallop.  scallops are very difficult to cook perfectly.  i've been to a number of spectacular restaurants that have had very disappointing scallops--typically overcooked and rubbery.  no problems here.  buttery, clean, and rich.  

the third dish was the foie gras with roasted almonds.  at this point i locked eyes with my wife and we both had the ""wtf did i just taste... did that just happen?"" look.  insane.  spectacular.  rich. indulgent.   the wine pairing was the most impressive of the night as well.  my favorite foie gras ever. 

dish number four?  oh yes, the 150 supplement of true japanese a5 kobe beef.  this is't the same faux-be kobe you've had before...this was the real deal Holyfield. kobe beef had been banned from the usa due to health concerns from japanese cattle.  that was until last year, when the ban was lifted.  ordered my steak medium rare.  it was...flawless.  it was the richest thing i've eaten in my life.  and it was surprisingly LARGE for such a decadent piece of meat.  i have been the king of eating big steaks.  i'm like john candy from the great outdoors when he eats the great 96'er... this steak was probably 8 ounces but was so incredibly rich and buttery that i couldn't finish it.  i feel humiliated even writing that.  

last dish was a choice from 5 or 6 dessert options.  delicious and also surprisingly generous portions

5171849,2013-05-29,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"This is truly exceptional food in Las Vegas. The outdoor seating really transformed my entire impression of Vegas, which back on the strip was loud and full of colorful personalities. You know that ""ahhh.....made a gazillion bucks and reflect at the fountains"" moment that Ocean's 11 shows? Yeah. You can totally ride that vibe by sitting outdoors at Picasso.

We made reservations well in advance for a party of 4, and requested fountain view. They don't really differentiate between outdoor and indoor for that, so make sure you are clear. I asked for an outdoor switch and they were so accommodating. The difference is that outside the tables are spaced out a lot more, you can hear the Bellagio Fountain music, and see the water really closely. Indoors is a whole different vibe--it's a full house, you can see the other patrons around you....but here, on the patio, we were in our own little world. Celebrating our meager $100 dolla winnings that felt like megamillions. Unfortunately, if there is any wind, some of the fountain show variations moves the spray over to the tables. (We only had 1 uh oh moment when we saw all the sprinkles traveling in a giant wave towards us. Yummy.)

Bread was delicious. They put something magical in that French bread. The butter has a Picasso etch, which was lovely. I asked for a non-alcoholic fruit drink, and they brought out a cocktail glass, and freshly shook a glass of a grapefruit concoction--oh my god, I wish I had a pint of that ($7 per glass). 

-Amuse bouche was very yummy, and set the meal well.
-Favorite out of the starter was the fish....which was totally, hands down, 5 star worthy. Pea soup was also very delectable, as was the oysters+caviar.
-Second: not a fan of foie gras, but I really enjoyed it off my friend's plate. The shrimp was also very tasty. 
-Main: Deer was surprisingly good, and everything was well balanced. It didn't taste very gamey at all. Everything else was well done, but not that memorable in my mind to get 5 stars. My fish was also really well executed.
-Dessert: underwhelming. I ordered the pear dessert, and the figs in the vanilla were a bit too chewy in my teeth--smaller chunks, please. The chocolate cake was decent, but nothing that spectacular. The passionfruit chocolate and rum ice cream was also good, but I have had better.

Overall, the service is impeccable (not intimidating at all), view is astounding outdoors, food is very well executed but not with many standout dishes. Dessert seems weak relative to the quality of the rest of the dishes. It's a wonderful, wonderful restaurant that deserves a visit if you are in Vegas, but don't expect it to be a best of your lifetime dining experience.

I got reservations for a Friday night at 6pm. When we went in they had a table for us, but my girlfriend wanted to sit outside. They were very accommodating and brought us out to a large table on the patio overlooking the water. When we first sat down, there were some pine needles and a bit of debris on the table. They cleaned it off and I did not think much of it, until later when we discovered why they were on the table. We were sitting under a pine tree, and when the wind blew it was dropping bits and pieces on the table! The waiter feigned ignorance as if he had never seen that happen before, but it detracted from an otherwise stellar meal.

So we took our time in deciding which of the three available courses we wanted. There was a prix fixe menu that my girlfriend ended up choosing and the degustation menu I decided on. I mentioned that I was pescatarian and the waiter said it was no problem making substitutions as need be, so I ended up substituting the foie gras dish for a shrimp dish from the prix fixe menu. I also decided to do the wine pairing for the degustation menu.

I have to say that all the food I had was exquisite. Each course had a wide variety of flavors, that blended together so well that I felt my palate was going on a ride. The various courses covered different sensations on my tongue as well, from creamy, to crispy, and nearly everything in between. It was all so rich and flavorful. All but one of the wine pairings seemed spot on.

My girlfriend enjoyed her meal as well, except for her main course of the roasted pigeon. She took one taste and decided it just was not for her. Fortunately when she took it home for the doggies, they LOVED it!

To our surprise, Picasso's sweet chef Julian Serrano made us a starter dish of a creamy white soup and fried potato whip that warmed up our taste buds to comfort and such an inviting beginning. Our next (""first"" on menu) dish was the lobster salad that was light and refreshing....also very good! Then came the perfectly seared scallops on top of a silky mash potato bed and light gravy pool--my favorite of the series of dishes! Another next dish was the duck confit foie gra that was sinfully rich and delightful. Finally, the main dish I had was the sea bass on asparagus was very fresh and yummy.

1.  We sat on the balcony and had an AMAZING view of the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes.  It was quite cold, but they had the heaters going and they offered the ladies an extra shawl to wear.  The husbands suffered, but such is life.
2.  The sommelier was so personable, knowledgeable, and just the best one we've ever had ANYWHERE!
3.  The desserts were totally on point in terms of presentation AND taste.
My husband, friend, and I did the standard tasting menu and our other friend did the degustation menu.  It was nice that they allowed the table to choose different options.  I started with the Crème of Parsnip Soup with rock shrimp and coulis of curry which was delicious, especially on the cold night.  Then I had the Sautéed Filet of Chilean Sea Bass
with cauliflower mouseline and saffron sauce which was pretty good, but just a tad dry- nothing to write home about.  I wanted to have something unique so I went with the Sautéed Medallions of Fallow Deer with caramelized green apple and zinfandel sauce.  Again, it was okay, but I thought it lacked a little flavor.  For dessert I went with the Earl Grey Cheesecake which, as mentioned earlier, didn't disappoint.  I don't think we'll be rushing to go back to Picasso, but I would go back.

Located in the luxurious Bellagio, Picasso is one of my favorite upscale restaurants in fabulous Las Vegas. 

Everything about Picasso radiates excellence- the service is impeccable, large selection of fine wines and liquors, and the pre-fixe menus are definitely not super size me portions, but perfectly portioned for you to enjoy your meal... to the very last scrumptious bite. To many, I guess the dishes are a little on the small side, especially for the price. If you decide to come to Picasso, be sure to make a reservation early enough so that you can request for a table with a view of the famous Bellagio Fountains show during your dinner.

It is everything you want in a Michelin Starred restaurant- it's elegant, intimate, delicious, above amazing service, and of course, expensive. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with comfortable furniture, and subtle details that compliment Picasso's rare exquisite paintings that hang on many walls of the restaurant. Even the presentations of the dishes are works of art themselves... both in taste and look.  A dinner at Picasso has a base price of $115 per person, so this definitely is not the place if you're on a budget. This is Las Vegas after all... I mean, go big or go home, right?  Although the pre-fixe price might deter many, the cultural and culinary experiences Picasso has to offer over the course of your meal is absolutely worth every hundred. I am looking forward to my trip to Vegas this summer because I cannot wait to book my dinner at Picasso!

But of course, Julian Serrano is at the helm here.  We had the tasting menu and everything was absolutely delicious.  Our sommilier was very knowledgable and the dishes came out one after another with barely any waiting in between.  This is one Vegas restaurant that I will definitely revisit.",c9qPBVq4CNRCBjvltsaHaQ,2,1,5,4Nm5RJcRd7jrxf3qT1gOeQ
5274258,2014-11-03,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Came to this beautiful restaurant on my birthday this year. It was AMAZING. The dining room is decorated tastefully with the focus on the wall of glass doors on to a terrace that is right next to the Bellagio fountains and also the impressive Picasso pieces featured all around the restaurant.

I had a glorious white chocolate martini. The prix fixe menu was perfect because I could choose from a couple of options for my courses. The chef sent over a little concoction in addition to what we had ordered. Everything we ate was absolutely savory and fantastic. With every bite I just wanted to close my eyes and just enjoy it. Between myself and my husband, we ordered a variety of the options and had ourselves a bit of a tasting. I can honestly say with all confidence that there is nothing the chef could put out that wouldn't have been exceptional. Every bite was just perfect.

I asked the waiter to choose a wine for me to go with my entree and he did an impeccable job. As a matter of fact, the entire service was perfectly timed, a nice balance of attentiveness but not hovering, friendly but professional. Just absolute perfection. Of all the fine dining establishments this is one of the handful that I can honestly say has zero room for improvement. Absolute PERFECTION in service. 

The desserts... Oh. My. Just life changingly good. And they sent us home with a sweet little box with a couple of muffins for later on. Just fantastic.

You will PAY for what you experience here. Our bill with gratuity exceeded $500 for the two of us. That included a generous but well-deserved 25% tip. Yes, this is a LOT of money for most of us but I can honestly say it was worth every penny. If you want a perfect fine dining experience, you will pay for it. That's just reality. I highly recommend splurging and getting this experience.",BF7EAhPupU7o9Wc7cRFncA,1,0,5,YgR16Mftb6Atc2-IY9LQgw
5279064,2011-01-28,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Full review in blog:  Notes on their degustation.

Arriving as we sipped our drinks the nightly amuse would be Cold Smoked Scottish Salmon, Caviar, Cucumber, Quail Egg, Crème Fraiche, and Potato Leek Soup.  Served curled around the crème fraiche the salmon was excellent - more firm than a sashimi prep, but similar in taste.  With the caviar somewhat less briny than others I've tasted it worked well with the somewhat sour crème while the egg added its characteristic creamy flavor.  The Potato soup was a commendable potage - the creamy texture balanced nicely with the onions and chives.

With myself ordering the 5-course degustation, largely unchanged over many years at Picasso, and Erika opting to go Prix Fixe for more choices our first courses would arrive simultaneously.  For my first dish, Maine Lobster Salad - Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette was ample in portion, elegant in presentation, and lovely on the palate.  With thick chunks of chilled lobster in a light cream sauce serving as the base, the ""salad"" was essentially microgreens tossed with apple-cider accented vinaigrette atop.  Flanked by melon balls and tomatoes of varying colors the dish was quite light, a wonderful opening volley even if it was much more ""lobster"" than ""salad.""

Course two was a Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau.  Served with a potato crisp standing playfully behind the single monstrous scallop the dish looked beautiful and the tastes were lovely, albeit predictable with the savory veal reduction balancing the sweet scallop.  With the creamy potato puree loaded with butter the place where this dish missed was in the centerpiece - gorgeously caramelized to the point of a near brulee on the exterior the scallop was simply a bit too well done at its center.  While certainly a competent and lovely preparation the fact remains that perhaps twenty less seconds on the pan could have elevated it to a whole different level.

The next course would provide my sister with an empty charger while I would receive the Sautéed ""A"" Steak of Foie Gras with Poached Pears, Huckleberries, Crushed Pistachios, Lemon Zest, and Rhubarb.  A large steak of 3-4 ounces of high quality and perfectly cleaned Foie Gras, the liver itself was everything you would expect.  Placed atop a ""cake"" of compressed pistachio and topped with roasted crunchy pistachios kissed with lemon the textures were a nice contrast and exceptionally complimentary.  Swirled with rhubarb reduction and plated alongside a poached pear with huckleberries this dish did not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but it was quite memorable for its classic approach.

The main course was Roasted Lamb Chops with Sweet Bell Pepper Farci turned out to be quite the substantial portion - easily 7-8oz including the bone.  Prepared rare and extremely juicy yet easily cut with the side of the fork this was without a doubt a top-5 all time lamb preparation.  Presented simply with rosemary, a stack of buttery potatoes, and a mélange of sweet bell peppers this would prove my favorite dish of the evening, regardless of how good the Foie Gras was.

Hazelnut and Coffee Opera with Coffee Hazelnut Ice Cream and Brown Sugar Filberts was quite impressive in presentation.  With a thin wedge of moist cake served on edge with a ""shadow"" of Hazelnut dust the flavor and texture of the cake was somewhere between almond dacquoise and tiramisu.  Resting happily next to the tall and proud cake, a small ball of similarly flavored ice cream atop candied nuts - creamy and crunchy, a nice cake and ice cream combination but certainly nothing to write home about.

Making our way from Picasso I must say I left with mixed emotions - not because anything was bad - as a matter of fact, everything was quite good.  The issue was that aside from a lovely Christmas Eve with my little sister at a restaurant that seemed unattainable a mere 8 years ago, nothing was ""great"" aside from the décor and art.  In the end I think Picasso has maintained its place in the Vegas culinary scene - it is just that many other restaurants, and my own personal dining preferences, have perhaps grown to be something more.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,6,4,YAyjxWgNjg4Dux7JxxvicA

5302134,2011-03-10,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Celebrated my friend's birthday here last night in Vegas.  This was definitely a memorable dining experience.  From the moment we walked in to the final gift pastries they left us with.  My friend had dietary restriction of no pork products and they accommodated us ahead of time and remembered all of our preferences.  A true 5 star experience.

I had the 4 course prixfixe menu while my friend had the 5 course degustation menu.  I had quail salad, fois gras cold mousse, veal chops while my friend had the lobster salad, scallop, seared fois gras and lamb chops.  This was my friend's first time in Vegas and his first multi course French dining experience, but it's my 20th time in Vegas, both of us were equally impressed, perhaps for slightly different reasons.

The ambience of the restaurant is also spot on, over looks the Bellagio fountains, genuine Picasso on the walls, upscale but not uptight, it really was just done right.  The dessert was the highlight, my friend ordered the beggars purse, which is risotto combined with chocolate mousse in a soft and crispy filo pastry.  They hand written Happy Birthday on the plate and the overall presentation was exquisite.

Now onto the wine list... Oh boy the wine menu was thicker than a school lecture book.  My friend didn't drink so we did not go for the wine pairing which I now regret, because the sommelier was amazing for the party next to us as I overheard his recommendations.  I will definitely try that next time.  I did have a glass of 2007 Syrah to go with my meal which was excellent.

The check came out to be about 300+ for two including tip.  It's comparable to other fine french dining such as Masas in SF.  I truly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone looking for a special dining experience in LV.",c1bSGYfHZXnMH1HVu-jxMA,0,0,4,8CzPq_yXoA-DMLQdvY1ZOQ

5319144,2013-07-17,9,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I went here on a date some time ago and it's clearly one of the top restaurants in Vegas.  Kudos to Julian Serrano.  Everything was executed well from start to finish.  Service was flawless.  A very romantic place decorated with Picasso art pieces - as an art school grad, this is a very nice touch.  You have a fabulous view of the fountains

From the prix fixe menu, we got: creme of butternut squash, warm quail salad, foie gras, sauteed bass and lobster.  Every single item was cooked to perfection, delicious and plated so beautifully - like a Picasso painting.  Perfection in every bite! 

Now, I must say this.  The items on the menu come in small portions so, if you're that hungry and you don't like waiting a long time for each course to be served - this is not the place for you.  Our dinner lasted at least 3 hours which gave us time to ourselves to chat and what not.

We had reservations at 5:45pm so had the pick of the litter as far as seating preferences go. We opted to sit out on the veranda (or lanai to HI) for first row experience of the fountains. In the two hours that it took to dine, we watched 4 fountain shows. Which we're just the best as usual. Here's a low down on the rest:

Pros: 
Ambiance- it's very romantic and peaceful. If you're not looking to have meaningful conversations with your dinner companions then don't come here. Lol.

Picasso Paintings- The various Picasso paintings around the restaurant were wonderful! They have a binder that you can have which explains the paintings and the history of the artist. Another pro of having early dinner reservations is that we could walk around the restaurant like a museum and view the paintings without bothering anyone. 

Service- on point, attentive and accommodating without pretension or pomp. However we did enjoy the showmanship of the wine sommelier. He was passionate about them wines boy! 

Cons:
Personally, tho the food was really good, I wouldn't have minded a few more options to the menu, but regardless of what you chose, it was all good.",ZmWLeLU_bGrNiqBVAGo-eg,1,1,4,_g0zY2MuVoQr1NOQL01GiQ

And I've been looking for the ""Picasso"" of every new city I've visited since. 

We had the tasting menu, which frankly started out strongest with poached oysters. Everything else was also amazing, but the oysters are the new comparison point. The ambience was divine and the wait staff was professional and approachable, with a healthy sense of humor.

5349105,2015-10-10,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I wanted to take my boyfriend somewhere special for his birthday and since he mentioned about how he wanted to dine at Picasso .. wha-la, I made reservations for dinner the night before his birthday. When I made the reservation, I had them make a note about getting seated at a table with the view of the fountains. You can't reserve a seat by the view but they can do their best. We ended up at the third table away from the window. 

The view was really nice, especially when the show came on. There were also a lot of artwork around the restaurant, which created a very calming atmosphere.

It was possibly the fanciest dinner that we've ever had in our lives thus far. Hopefully there will be more to come in the future. 

Moving on... Picasso has two different menus for you to choose from -- their prix-fixe (four courses) or their chef's tasting menu (five courses) which was labeled ""Degustation."" They also have a thick menu for their wines. My boyfriend opted for the chef's tasting menu while I had their prix-fixe with a glass of Riesling wine. 

I chose the:

Poached Oysters: Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. The texture of the oyster was perfect and had a creamy sauce with it. 
Sauteed Chilean Sea Bass: The warm meat with a slight crisp was definitely a wonderful combination. However, the mashed potatoes are HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY. 
Roasted Veal Chop: I've never had veal before so I wasn't sure what to expect but I must say... I do not like it. The texture and consistency of the veal reminded me too much of pork chops -- just more tender. There also wasn't much taste or seasoning to it so it was probably my least favorite dish. 

I also got to try a bite of the dishes that my boyfriend got. The lobster salad was very refreshing. Scallops just aren't my thing so no comment on that. Foie gras steak .. was heavy but really delicious. The lamb was DELICIOUS. If you like lamb then you oughta get it. It was so tender and full of lamb flavor.

We got to choose our dessert from their menu and I went with the earl gray cheesecake. Their desserts are the epitome of sweet. This is why people have coffee with their desserts. The slice of cheesecake was topped with earl gray ice cream. I actually wished that the cheesecake itself would have some earl gray flavor .. but it was just really sweet instead. It was good but a little too sweet for my tooth. 

Dinner lasted three hours. So it's not a grab and go. It's a, ""let's enjoy our night here."" Definitely a great place to dine at for special occasions or if you want to just treat yourself. It is a bit on the pricey side but you pay for what you get. The service is amazing and friendly even though we were a little lost ... our first time and everything. The whole experience was definitely memorable. 

The only thing about Picasso was that their menu items are on a bit on the heavy side. Lots of fattyness and creamyness. My boyfriend and I were STUFFED to the bone after dinner. Not to mention my stomach was doing flip flops so I had to rush to the bathroom right after dinner. My stomach most likely did not enjoy the amount of fat and cream that was in my food. 

Overall, we would definitely return for another dining experience sometime in the future.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,3,5,txuH5YNgIrsBH1sIcfBvmA

5374022,2015-01-27,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Fantastic, Beautiful, World-class, Foodgasm... these are just some of the words I'd use to describe Picasso. Before you read the rest of the review ask yourself do you think of eating at a restaurant as a journey as much as it is a meal? Do you appreciate the amount of effort that goes into the preparation of your meal? Do you appreciate the lost art of waitering (probably not a word)? Then do yourself a favor and reserve a table at Picasso if you're in town. 

Starting with the food. Picasso is primarily focused on prix fixe menus. They offered four different prix fixe menus when we went in January 2015 for dinner. Two of the options were meat focused, the third was vegetarian inspired, and the fourth was a special menu that highlighted truffles. Make sure you take a peak at their website to see what they are serving if you're a particular eater because while you can customize your prix fixe menu a little bit there's not a whole lot of wiggle room. Also consider the price before you go since each prix fixe menu averages around $125 and some course options that require an additional upcharge on top of the prix fixe menu cost. 

Okay with that being said, the food is amazing. The chef started us off with a little something to get us started (leak soup) before we started our first course and it was a lovely little starter to get the taste buds going. The first course was lobster salad and it was amazing. The size of the ""salad"" was approimately the size of a small biscuit and primarily consisted of lobster meat, Delicious. The second course was a scallop on top of mashed potatoes in a veal reduction. I don't even like scallops but this was delicious as well. The third course was frois gras and this was the show stopper. Let me preface by saying I love frois gras. My girlfriend isn't a huge fan but she came away loving this dish as much as I did. The fourth course was a perfectly cooked lamb dish. Lastly, the fifth course was dessert. She selected the fig stuffed pear, and I picked a hazelnut chocolate cake. Both desserts were amazing and a lovely way to end the meal. When they bring the check out they bring several truffles on a little platter that we thought was cute. Make sure you take your time through courses because even though the portions aren't extremely large on a course by course basis, we were stuffed after all of our courses. 

Let me speak to the service now. The service at Picasso is one of if not the best service I've ever experienced in fine dining. Our main waiter took our order, offered wonderful suggestions, and accomodated us on our food allergies. Once we made our selections a runner would bring us each course as went and they described the dishes they placed in front of us beautifully. With the conclusion of each course we were given new silverware which I think is something that not enough restaurants do. By the end of our meal you gain so much rapport with your waiter that you wouldn't think twice about shaking his hand as you thank him for the experience. 

The environment of the restaurant was upscale and elegant. The restaurant is pretty large and if you're lucky you'll have a seat facing the Bellagio fountains. I knew they had Picasso paintings here but I thought there would only be one. You'll find several of his works scattered throughout the restaurant so coming here is just as much a cultural experience as it is a meal. 

Overall, I can't say enough positive things about Picasso. If you've made it this far in the review then I appreciate you reading but honestly you should just go. There's a reason why this place is rated so highly by the yelp community and even though it comes at a hefty price tag, dinging here is an experience no one should leave Vegas without. Think about it this way, a Vegas show could costs upwards of $80+/person for about 1-1.5 hours. This meal is a little more than that and will take up just as much time. Plus you'll get just as good an experience as a show. Definitely worth it. I know I'll be back the next time I'm in town. Enjoy!",xGDcXcscWQl_X0R3f1LIzw,0,0,5,bN0lmlQuqw4DvkksTdpFBA

Every big name restaurant has its defining item that I take with me into my foodie memory.  I wanted Picasso's to be something grand, like the ""barely cooked salmon"" at Le Bernadine but though everything was great (vegetarians must all want a puree of some vegi under some well cooked vegetable) nothing was as exceptional as their Raisin Bread.

Got 4 stars because it was good but was only remarkable for the memories of family and the bread... Well the poached pear desert did come in a close second to the bread.

I was later told that the chef is intentional about and enjoys preparing his dishes with the favors of the food items as the flavor profile.  I wish I had known this prior to eating there.  I would have still eaten there but my pallet would not have felt as cheated in flavoring as it did.  For a premium price I desired to be wowed.

The service was also spot on.. with my only minor complaint being that waiter didn't seem to know the desserts very well cuz when we asked for suggestions or specific he seemed to either not know or not be interested in sharing his opinons.

I've had this  flavor combination before but found Picasso's rendition to be not quite as flavorful and as if something was amiss w/the combination. On a good note, the fois gras was cooked perfectly and seared just right and it was a generous portion as well.  I should also mention the lamb was fabulous -- juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. 

On a slight down note, the departing gift was somewhat lack luster. Generally, most restaurants of this caliber give you a small (or not so small like at Joel Robuchon!) parting gift and Picasso was no different in this respect but the cookies we received were sub-par to the food we tasted in the restaurant. They tasted stale and like they'd been sitting around for days. I'd rather they'd given us nothing as I hated for my last impression of Picasso be these stale cookies.  

Overall however, I'd return in a heartbeat and can only hope that someday Mr. Serrano will open something in LA of the same caliber.",WvntDWMQnaEV8agu3gcTug,1,1,4,XiedFuB0LAX2hWcBX8aB1A

5437718,2016-06-11,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,I took my wife here for our anniversary dinner.  You must understand that this place is expensive not just because of the food but also because you are paying for the experience and ambiance as a whole.  The paintings are amazing and you must walk around to look at them.  There were people in the restaurant that had no clue that these were actual Picasso painting and were wondering why we were admiring them.  The scenery and the views in this place are truly amazing.  I originally wanted to sit outside I made reservations for 630 but it was just way to hot so we asked to be seated inside because if you are able to sit outside and watch the water show that is so awesome.  Now onto the review of the food.  Me and my wife chose the prefix menus instead of the degustion I was a little annoyed that you have to pay an additional 150 dollars for the filet mignon on the five course tasting menu.  Now based on what I ordered I would give this place 3 stars only but because I was able to taste my wife's choices and those were fabulous.  I will start if with what I had first meal was the quail salad in my opinion that quail was cooked perfectly but was missing seasoning such as salt and pepper and left me wanting more as I at the meal.  My wife had the poached oysters with caviar I tasted one needless to say that was just amazing.  Next I had the fois gras.  I want to state that I was looking for forward to this all week I love fois gras and being from New York I have went to some French restaurants and it is a must for me to order.  The presentation of the 2nd course was beautiful but the fois gras was just ok it was lacking once again that needed flavor I was used to instead I feel the meal relied heavily on the jellies and berries accompanying the fois gras.  My wife got the shrimp which was amazing after tasting a piece.  Next we have the main entrees I selected the veal and my wife selected the main lobster now i was annoyed once more because the lobster had an extra 30 dollars added to the pre fix price but that is just a pet peeve of mine.  The veal for me was the redeeming part of the meal on my end.  It was cooked perfectly and the accompanied vegetables were paired very well along with the gravy.  My wife's lobster meal was just pure perfection also.  Lastly came the dessert my wife chose the strawberry cheesecake and I chose the chocolate lava cake.  I had told them earlier when I made the reservations that it was our anniversary and they made a wonderful arrangement for us.  Now I saw in some reviews that they also brought out little sweets for the guests we did not receive those and wish we did get some.  At the end I settled the bill and when we walked out they gave us two small boxes with two pieces of cake in each of them.  Overall a very nice experience with wonderful customer service and amazing ambiance.,JZU-QFW00LtMV2a7KB66AQ,0,0,4,d97J-rx_unqSXSoQZTx9ZA
5441104,2018-03-18,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"If I could rate them as 6 out of 5, I would.

This place was perfect in every way imaginable.

First, I was very impressed with the interior. Seeing $200M worth of Picasso paintings and having a $20M painting right next to my table was a treat on its own. The carpet was designed by Picasso's daughter and was installed as one piece rather than individual pieces glued together. I was told they paid $1M for that piece of carpet.

Second, I really loved the food. It was inventive and tasted very different. It made me want more. The oyster appetizer was out of this world. The pigeon was insanely good.

Third, I liked the wine and liquor selection. They had some unique cocktails. I ordered one whiskey-based cocktail whose name I don't remember, but I do remember that it was very different from anything I've tried before, so it was obvious that they paid attention to every part of service delivery, not just the main  menu. The wine pairing was good as well. The sommelier did a great job explaining why this pairing is great and I could tell that he cared a lot about my experience.

Although the place is considered expensive, I actually thought it was reasonably priced. Other restaurants with two michelin stars charge two times more for the same type of experience. The upcharge on wine pairing was reasonable as well.

Finally, I loved the service. They had insane attention to detail. While they tried to slow it down and help me (the guest) relax and give me time to think, decide, and enjoy a beautiful view of Bellagio fountains, they were fast to bring me one course after another, timely bring me wine pairings, clear the table, and check on me. I didn't feel like I was waiting for anything at all. The manager stopped by twice to see how I am doing and answered my questions about Picasso paintings. While they were busy, they made me feel like I was their only guest and the world rotated around me. I was very impressed by everything they did and how well they calculated every move.

It's definitely an A++ place and I am coming there again next time I am in Vegas.",Js1cNMkENC07XmKu3NCU8w,2,1,5,nyLJHVMWVbBVygISvkaNFw

5448964,2015-10-19,3,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"My husband and our married couple friend (don't have too many of those haha) wanted to grab a nice dinner before seeing O in the Bellagio. I set up the reservations about a week in advance via Open Table. I mentioned about seeing O at 7pm and figured 5:30 reservations should be plenty of time. It wasn't but see below for more information. 

Upon entering I wish I had requested outdoor seating. The view of the fountain would of been amazing and I could see a little from our table. Just something to note if you are making reservations which are a must!

The first thing we tried was a shot of soup. I don't remember the name of what it was but it was given to our table without being on the menu. It was like a chowder of sorts. We also enjoyed some warm delicious bread and butter. I swear I had 2-3 pieces and didn't care. Good carbs??

Our first course came out andI had ordered the Poached Oysters - garnished with Osetra Caviar, Sauce Vermouth. I thought they were only okay and tasted very fishy. Gross! My husband had the Crème of Parsnip Soup- Rock Shrimp and Coulis of Curry. I honestly wasn't a fan but it was his favorite thing about the meal.

The second course was my favorite part of the meal. Big Eye Tuna Tartare Mashed Avocado. OMG my tastebuds were signing to the heavens over this deliciousness that entered my mouth. My husband ordered the Sautéed Filet of Chilean Sea Bass with Cauliflower Mouseline and Saffron Sauce. This honestly was just meh and glad I had ordered my tuna tartare. 

The third course I had ordered the Sautéed Filet of Scottish Salmon
Mashed Celery Root and Oxtail Jus. The salmon was good and not overcooked. I could easily use my fork to cut the salmon up into bite size pieces. The salmon meal reminded me of Coastal Flats salmon in the DC metro area. My husband ordered the Sautéed Medallions of Fallow Deer Caramelized Green Apple and Zinfandel Sauce. The deer meat wasn't very gamey which is always a plus. I thought it was just meh as well as my husband.

Last but not least was my favorite part, dessert. I was undecided on what to get but my decision was the best since the whole table ordered something different to try.  My deliciousness very rich desserts was theHazelnut Joconde- Gianduia Mousse, Vanilla Frangelico Ice Cream, Chocolate Covered Hazelnuts. Also our table was given a small dessert tray of different chocolates. I think this was an added bonus due to the fact that our table was celebrating our anniversaries. 

As we were leaving we were given a special treat to take with us as a Thank You. It ended up being a banana bread soft cookie. It made a great late night snack.

Customer service was beyond 5 stars here. I would come here again on this alone. Granted it was an expensive meal even if it was pre pix menu. My husband wasn't happy with his choices but I was pleasantly surprised with most of mine.

My issue was setting up the reservations for 5:30pm and noted the fact that our table was seeing O at 7pm through Open Table comments. We didn't leave the place until 6:59pm. We had to run across the Bellagio to get to the theater and then have to go to the bathrooms that were located on the second floor. We started to miss a little bit of the beginning of the show which was okay since nothing too amazing was happening. It was still annoying all the same.

5455378,2011-01-12,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Already?
It's been a month since I started being a Yelper and it's already my 100th review!
To make my 100th special, I thought hard (for about 2 min) on which restaurant I should write about...
Simply enough, I decided to write on my favorite restaurant Picasso. 

Honestly, I like checking out Michelin Star restaurants, but I am not always impressed because I become more of a critical reviewer at restaurants that costs more. Yes, I am a believer for paying for chef's art, beautiful atmosphere and best service, but ""food"" should taste extra good (because good is not enough) to deserve such a high-end restaurant name, no?

Picasso satisfied all. 
Even with all the restaurants I have been to, it's one of rare restaurants that brought ""WOW........................(speechless)"" from me.
Mind-blowing food, amazing artwork of Picasso, great service, decent price (what you are getting), there is really nothing to complain about!! 

ATMOSPHERE
Picasso didn't disappoint with their decor. Overall, the ambiance was sophisticated and elegant.Well over $100M original works by Picasso on the walls everywhere, your eyes are immediately happy. I just wonder why each piece isn't protected with a glass! Although we requested ""somewhere romantic"", we were led to a cozy booth and were only able to peek at Bellagio's water show. If you can, sit by the window!

SERVICE
What you would expect from two Michelin Star restaurant; the service was impeccable. They appear and disappear magically on cue, fulfilling everything you wanted and even those you didn't know you needed. Sommelier here was also amazing! We wanted to find the wine we drank on our first date & surely... after detailed description & trying to track down the taste we had of French Pinot Gris, the knowledgeable sommelier found it for us!!!!!! Yes, finding the rare wine we had on our first date definitely helped set the mood & made our dining much more special at Picasso.

FOOD
Words cannot describe how amazing this dining experience was. 
The entire meal did last long, about 2.5 hrs for us, so make sure you don't have a show to catch after the meal! 
We ordered the Prix Fixe menu & Menu Degustation, because we wanted to try more....Well, and also because I wanted certain things on top of what I wanted to eat! 
It's easier to like food I already love. However, what I can say about the Picasso's food is that there were many items I don't usually eat -- such as oysters & foie gras -- but they were DELICIOUS and I would return for more. Even my bf who doesn't like gamey meat like deer & who 'hates' foie gras, enjoyed everything. That's when I know that the food is SPECTACULAR... 

-Olive bread - Good, but what's better? The butter! Yup. The butter with Picasso writing on it, which we ruined shortly after receiving... 
-Amuse Bouche - 1) mushroom soup with chives and almond & 2) brioche with foie gras smear & apple. Both were good & got us excited for the main courses
-Poached oysters - I don't eat oysters. But my foodie friends that recommended Picasso to me raved about their poached oysters & I really wanted to try it! Surely, it was unbelievably tasty! Creamy and sweet, with the slightly saltiness!
-Maine lobster salad - Light and refreshing! The salad had huge pieces of lobster meat with tiny balls of different melons. Not only was it visually appealing, it was delicious! Although simple, it could be my favorite. A good way to start to the night. 
-Scottish salmon - Not your ordinary salmon! Super creamy & buttery, this was my bf's favorite.
-Pan seared scallops - Scallops were seared to PERFECTION period! One of the best scallop, if not the best, I have ever had! 
-Steak of foie gras - Again, I am not a fan of foie gras... but this was smooth and savory! Unlike really rich foie gras that can be overwhelming, this was prepared buttery yet clean; with almost like a super tender steak!
-Fallow deer - Of course, still gamey than steak, but this deer was tender and savory. Definitely the best deer I've had.
-Halibut - I picked this over roasted lamb chops, because my bf is not a lamb lover. The halibut was cooked to perfection with clean taste.
-Blood orange and raspberry glace - I chose this, as I am a blood orange lover. Wow!
-Blackberry linzer tart -Bf & I both chose this for his selection of dessert. From this dessert, our fav was the black muscat sorbet! Yummm.
-Mini dessert plate - As if we were not fed enough, the mini truffles and other tiny bites were very good!
-Cookie box to take home! This, we had as 'breakfast' the next morning & it was goooood! Buttery layers of crisp cookies! 
   
You are looking at around $150 for the fixed menu, adding a bottle of wine for $100+ to finish ~$450+ for two with good tip. (Thank you, BF!) Although definitely not cheap, it's not as over priced as some other restaurants & I do think it's worth every penny. 

With A+ for Food, Ambiance, and Service, it's impossible for me not to recommend Picasso. I love you, chef Julian Serrano!",APnknK5EwtWrgQvlUVF16g,5,4,5,GGuIn3m6N0nAEk_zPHXmOQ

We call Picasso that morning but was told they were closed until 5pm. When I call at 5pm to tell them what happened, they told me to call the Security Dept., when I spoke to the Security Dept, they wanted to know where I fell. I explained we got Food Poisoning and did not slip and fall. They informed me that they only took reports for falls or thing like that. I called again and was told the same thing.

My husband and I decided to go with the menu degustation and wine pairings. 5 flavorful courses. Our favorite dish was unanimously the scallop. But the lobster salad was up there.

Well who said you can't hook up again when they're back in town???

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 6th anniversary with a nice dinner.   It had been a long time since we were last here and it sounded a lot better than going to Red Lobster.  The original plan was to dine indoors and admire all the wonderful, priceless Picasso art displayed around the restaurant since we sat outside last time.  The hostess informed us they had a table open outside and asked if we wanted to check it out before deciding.  The fountain show was going off right then and we gave into the temptation of the patio once again.  Screw art :)  It's one of the best atmospheres to dine in Vegas!  I can't say no!

You get one of two course choices, there's the prix fixe and the menu dégustation.  We ordered one of each with wine pairings and even though the menu hadn't changed very much over the years, it was even more awesome now than before.  I think I appreciate fine dining now more than I did 6 years ago but that could also be due to prescription pills.  

We're foie gras crazy people so that was one of the many highlights.  The foie gras au torchon is the way my wife prefers it while I love their ""sautéed steak of ""A"" foie gras"".  The tenderness, oil and fattyness of it all complemented with figs and pistachios is like having a mouthful of multiple orgasms.

The pan seared U-10 day boat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau is like the most perfect, hand picked scallop.  A pearl!  I try to eat as small a bite as possible to savor it all.  

You basically can't go wrong with any of it.  Why change the menu when it's pretty much perfect?  This also marks the first time I've gotten through wine courses without leaving totally bombed at the end.  I must be getting more mature :P

Empty plates never linger for more than a few moments on your table. Any silverware taken away is replaced by another within a few moments. Water and wine glasses are never empty. This was also my experience at, e.g., Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, etc.

If you are seated near the windowed doors (which we were), you can see the fountain show just off the balcony, and hotel lights across the Las Vegas Strip.

Portions were not large, as you would expect at a Michelin starred French restaurant. 
Poached oysters were good; foie gras with jam was good; venison (deer) was good; pheasant was good; lamb shank was good; and Chilean sea bass was good.

All-in-all, a very enjoyable experience.",zvicQaTmNTvnrJRA-7yv-w,4,0,5,kGS9h9kxu23dnAeintUjSA

        I've been wanted to write about Picasso for months, in fact, I wrote a review on Picasso with my previous old account! Some photos are still on here, but the last few time I was here, chef Julian Serrano blew my mind, my parents mind, again and again.

        The resto itself is classic elegant, beautiful setting with Bellagio water fountain dancing, delicious food, stunning wines, and impeccable service again and again! Wish I was with a date, but never did when I was here. Always with my parents, broski, or friends, odd right?

        Just another thing that I admire and a fan of Picasso, Master Sommelier here; how many in the US now, just barely over 100, at Bellagio alone has 4 master sommelier, enough said about this resort, and at Picasso a master sommelier and 2 other sommeliers , just that. Stunning wine list and pairing, and of course, who can forget the 11 original Paolo Picasso paintings, priceless for any meals!

        A few dishes (OK so more than a few) that dear to my parents and my belly:

- Pepper cold soup & salmon croquette;

- Poached Oysters Garnished with Osetra Caviar, Sauce Vermouth - 4 oysters, extremely well prepared!

- Warm Quail Salad Sautéed Artichokes, Pinenuts - classic dish!

- Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette - light and nice!

- Ragout of Seasonal Vegetables, Fresh Foie Gras and Jus de Poularde - oh heaven me!

- Ruby red shrimp - seasonal, well balanced!

- Pan Seared Sea Scallops Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau - single gigantic scallop, tasty!

- Sautéed ""A"" Steak of Foie Gras Honey Muscat Poached Pears with Crème Fraîche Gastrique,Briocheand Crushed Almonds - My mom went banana on this dish every single time!

- Sautéed Medallions of Fallow Deer Caramelized Green Apples and Zinfandel Sauce - gaming, aromatic, must order!

- Roasted Pigeon Wild Rice Risotto - big plate, enough to share for two! Fantastic dish!

- Tournedos of Aged Lamb -  you want a red meat with a good bottle of Bordeaux, this is IT!

- Desserts, I don't even eat sweet, my parents couldn't stop praising these sweet dishes here. I, on the other hand, dessert wines list here is excellent, my kind of sweetness!

         Let make it simple, this is where a MUST DINE resto for my parents on their anniversary week every years when we are in Vegas!

The Mr and I rarely  go to Vegas but when we do we usually dine at Le Cirque, this time I decided to break with tradition and give Picasso a try. It did not disappoint! The restaurant is a tad bit hard to find, but it's across the way from Chanel boutique down the escalators for those who are more familiar with ""landmarks"" than actual directions such as yours truly. :-p 

See if you can sit by the windows, because the restaurant is situated by the famous Bellagio fountains so you're sitting in the front row during dinner. You will find Picasso art pieces around the restaurant- some you will recognize - some you may not. 

It's a pre-fixe menu so it will change periodically, I don't believe I saw an a la carte menu. So I don't recommend this place if you are not really adventurous, or is deathly allergic to certain things where the chef would have to make so many changes to the dish that it would jeopardize the integrity of the dish and therefore your overall experience. I have attached photos for your enjoyment with a brief description should you come across the same dishes when you dine there. Cheers!",AcW8IDbzEIP61wa9Ktah3A,2,1,5,9uKYx0jYFb-KXhAzS8wPew

Everyone from the host/hostess, possibly the chef          (? when we first walked in) to the wait staff from the minute we walked in were SO friendly and attentive. There were beautiful Picasso pieces up along the walls of the restaurant.  And our meal was preceeded by the awesome water show right outside the terrace of the restaurant, with a view of Paris and other Vegas strip hotels in the background. I snuck my blackberry out every now and then so I could document EVERYTHING we were eating, because we're such foodies.  We both had prix fixe menus along with some Tikal Malbec.  Our notable favorites were the ""Chef's Welcome"": pheasant croquettes with a shot of roasted red pepper bisque, poached oysters w/caviar in vermouth sauce, medallions of fallow deer, lobster salad, pan-seared scallops in veal reduction and calvados crepe coin purse dessert. The service was eggcellent, and I enjoyed every bit of the meal.  It is the best meal I've had in my life thus far. Overstatement? Nah.",STe0UgkKX6DkmF_chajDog,1,1,5,SoE0YNvOw00RFAtZoDTQeA

Unfortunately, the experience has gone downhill over the years. Picasso used to be a fine dining restaurant where the dress code was enforced and men without jackets were offered jackets to wear during their meals. Now, management seems to feel that a track suit, sneaker and hats count as suitable attire. When I complained to the staff, I was told there was ""nothing they could do."" How about: enforcing the dress code; offering a jacket; requiring the removal of hats; and/or not seating them/seating them somewhere other than the middle of the dining room?

5725542,2016-02-21,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"I really wanted to love this place but it was disappointing at best. My boyfriend and I were SO EXCITED to try Picasso out and actually went to Las Vegas for this restaurant. It was solely a food trip. With such amazing reviews we expected the food to dazzle us.

Let's start with the atmosphere. The restaurant is really nice and the interior is pretty. There's paintings hanging here and there. We arrived right on time, but we did have to wait a little bit for our tables. 

We both decided to go with the tasting menu. My boyfriend chose lamb for the entree and I chose the fish dish. My boyfriend also had wine pairing along with the tasting menu. I sipped a little bit of each of the wine. 

Now as for the food and wine-nothing stood out. And I really mean NOTHING. Every single dish was mediocre. I've been to Providence, Benu, Keiko, N/Naka before and for each experience I always had at least a few dishes that I LOVED. Lobster salad was bland and didn't taste like much. Foie gras was my favorite dish out of what was served that day, but it wasn't mind blowing either. Both the lamb and fish dish was pretty bad. The lamb was so chewy and my fish was not seasoned enough. The fish itself honestly just tasted like grilled fish and the potato and broccoli that was served with it tasted like boiled vegetables. Honestly, I could have just bought made these at home myself. Dessert was not bad, but too sweet for my taste. That's just personal preference though, so if you like very sweet desserts, you will enjoy the dessert here. 

As for the wine pairing, both my boyfriend and I didn't really like how the wines were paired. I felt like the pairing with the scallop dish disturbed/clashed with the flavor of the scallops. But again, that may be personal preference as well. I tend to just prefer fruity wines over earthier ones. 

It's really difficult to hear what the sommelier is saying because he has a tiny voice and tends to murmur a little. I tried asking him twice for some of the wine pairing explanations, but just gave up in the end. I wish he would articulate better when he speaks. Sometimes if the sommelier really tells you how the wine is and how it goes well with the food the experience becomes much more enjoyable. This was definitely not the case here. 

Our server on the other hand was very nice. And this is really the primary reason why I decided to give this place 2 stars instead of 1 star. 

I don't know if I can blame the restaurant for this but there was a couple taking pictures of the paintings on the wall. And that's fine so long as you are not disturbing us but they decided to walk up to our table and the girl asked me to move so that she can take a picture of the painting. Come on. Please have some courtesy for other guests. It was so rude and that couple continued to go all around the restaurant with their camera to take pictures asking other people to move as well. I would think the staff could have asked them courteously to not disturb other guests during the experience.


IN SHORT- Overpriced for what they serve you. Go elsewhere if you want to have good food. There are plenty of choices in Las Vegas. I prefer Julian Serrano at Aria to this place. (Which is funny because Julian Serrano is the Executive Chef at Picasso).",g2sUPItnLsrWeAhiBU2Ghg,1,1,2,PTgSzJ9Ar5gqpbAKEbKALw

I had the degustation while hubby had the truffle tasting. started with a light crab salad, then a perfectly seared scallop. Next was a rich foie gras with crispy almond slivers followed by a perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. Hubby's came with filet (not wagyu) which was topped with truffle. My wagyu was rich and buttery while his filet had a bolder meaty flavor, to each their own. Don't forget their coffee which is an excellent finish to the meal along with their beautifully artistic desserts. Wines pair well with meals.

5738594,2013-05-21,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"We went to Picasso last night for dinner on our last night in Vegas.  The restaurant was beautiful and had wonderful views of the bellagio fountains.  A small gripe- I booked my reservations months in advance requesting a table by the windows and letting them know we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  We were not given a window table, even after I asked, and I saw empty tables by the window that were never filled.  They also never acknowledged our anniversary, which again is not the end of the world.

We both ordered the 5 course tasting menu, although none of the menu options were explained to us.  The 1st course, the main lobster salad, was amazing and so fresh.  I loved it!  The bread was ok- not hot, which I would expect at a place of this caliber.  The 2nd course, the scallop, was good but not amazing.  Honestly, I had scallops that were a little better at Lakeside earlier that week.  The 3rd course, the foigras was amazing and the rhubarb sauce was perfection.  The 4th course- mine was the lamb, was by far the best I have ever had by far.  Super tender and melts in your mouth.  My husband had he halibut which was good but not amazing.  Dessert was good but again- looked better than it tasted- I had cheesecake and my husband had chocolate fondant.  

Overall, the food and service were great, but if I'm comparing it to Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon, there is simply no comparison.  Both Guy and Robuchon are in a different league, so I find it odd that they are compared so often and priced similarly (at least to Guy).  At both Guy Savoy and Robuchon, we were offered dozens of bread options from a cart and a cheese selection that was unreal.  Then we were also offered a candy/dessert cart.  At Picasso, we were not offered cheese unless you wanted it in lieu of dessert and for 14 up charge.  I also mentioned to the waiter that I wish I could do cheese and dessert, and he sort of shrugged and said it is a hard decision.  

I'm just saying for hundreds of dollars at dinner, I ought to get whatever I want right?  Anyway, I think Picasso is awesome and the food is outstanding.

We celebrated my wife's birthday at Picasso and had a lovely time and enjoyed super delicious food. When I made the reservation, I asked for a very nice table, and they gave us one right next to a window so we could watch the Bellagio Fountain show just outside five or six or more times during our meal. It was magical.

There are many, many reviews of this restaurant - please note the other 5 star reviews if you'd like to have an idea of what your in for.

The highlights for us were the poached oysters, which I can only describe as ""luxury clams"" - I've never had poached oysters, but now I'll be chasing this taste for years to come. I think I could have been happy with 15 or 20 of these guys for dinner, but 4 was delicious. We also really enjoyed the lobster and my wife's pigeon which wasn't nearly as gamey as they suggested - it tasted to me like a leaner duck maybe. It was delicious.

We also each enjoyed the somm's wine pairing for our meal. The amount of wine was perfect, and major cheers to the somm who made the pairings because they were just about perfect. Personally, I'd prefer a bottle of very high quality sake over white wine with seafood, but their choices were wonderful. I loved every glass.

I cannot recommend Picasso's highly enough. If you're staying on the strip in Vegas and you can afford it, you should certainly check it out.

In the end, in September 2017, our meal was just over $520 with tip. That's for two of the price fixe menus, a $30 lobster supplement (totally worth it), and two wine pairings (not the deluxe pairings, which are just there for bigger whales).",-Va8viFH6binpQm5mefvOA,1,0,5,2lArUcMEFDxM6Ml9pPI2Ng
5784551,2013-03-18,2,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"My wife would give it a 6 star rating. The food was well made. Not very flavorful but rich and delicate (a work of art my my fancy wife just added). Quantity is slim if you are a big guy but for the skinny jeans wearing and no chest hair type guys, the quantity will suffice. I had the $115 dinner my friends had the $125 option and were disappointed in the quantity and hated the foie gras (not their type of food) and the fact that the ""scallops"" was really ""a scallop"" and the ""lamb chops"" was ""a lamb chop"".  Good experience overall. Great service. They forgot to bring me my coffee do they ended comping which was not necessary but goes with the classiness of this place. $300 million in Picasso painting according to some places I've read. You get a good view of fountains if you get seats next to window which we couldn't because they only seat 2 and we were 4. Even with reservations don't expect to get fountain view table for 2 as a guarantee. 

If you are a vegetarian or pescetarian as ourselves let them know and they will go out of their way for you. Like I said service is great. If my expectation of the food wasn't so high going in I would have rated it higher. It doesn't matter what Zagat or Michelin or Opera Winfrey say or how many stars, thumbs up or diamonds anyone gives them. Food is going into your mouth. Maybe they had a special meal cooked for them by Picasso himself. 

So worth going but don't expect to taste heaven. Its good food that is different than what you will get in your typical U.S. city. It's the higher than normal expectations and us being spoiled that has ruined our planet and society as a whole so try it out and stop reading these reviews like a stingy old man.",_JD4NQXQ2ClThnposIKSnw,2,2,3,miGi8By3iN1htbaZvR-Tpw
5806340,2010-02-15,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"We were excited about dining at Picasso after reading great reviews, but our table of six could not have been more disappointed in the experience.

We had heard there were two menu options, but when we arrived, only the $150 per person menu was offerred without apology.  It wasn't until I read the preceding review that I learned that the restaurant ""ran out"" of the lesser priced menu.

The amuse buche was bland--a red pepper puree soup with a tasteless fried ""something"" that we jokingly referred to as a ""fish stick"".   The Maine lobster was good enough, but the poached oysters were--again--bland.  I'm afraid the word ""bland"" could be sprinkled throughout this review.  The only star item--and I do mean the ONLY standout offerred--was the foie gras.  

The main entree was the most disappointing.  There was not a single beef choice except a $150 upgrade for Kobe beef.  Among the included options was a choice of pigeon which our waiter explained had a taste very similar to liver and that it was hit with the Asian crowd.  Both seafood options--the halibut and swordfish were dry, overcooked, and tasteless.  On the other hand, my lamb was well prepared.  

When the waiter stopped by at the end of our meal to ask how we enjoyed dinner, I told him that if he wanted an honest answer, he should know that we were very disappointed.  He said, ""I'm sorry to hear that,"" then picked up our plates.  He could not have cared less.

To top it off, we tried six different desserts to share.  One in our party commented that one of the lavendar (we think) infused desserts tasted like soap.  We thought it was a joke, but in reality, she was right!  It remained untouched.

Our table of 6 spent over $1200 for our meal, and at that price, this restaurant deserves one star.  This was pedestrian fare at elegant prices.

Maybe it was the crowded Valentine's evening that caused the lackluster food.  In any case, it is unfair to charge standard prices for a sub-standard experience.

I called the restaurant this morning to share our experience, but they are not yet open.  I'll try again this afternoon, and I'll post back to this review about my discussion with the management.

Update 2-21-2010:  After calling Mr. Gilles Kolakowski, the manager of Picasso, I received a heartfelt apology for our disappointing evening.  He explained that Valentine's day found them with a significant spike in business.  In a follow up email, he asked that I contact him when we return to Las Vegas, so he could personally make a reservation for us.  Mr. Kolakowski promised that during our next visit to Picasso, he and his staff would demonstrate why the restaurant has routinely received rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome, and I look forward to our next evening there.",qgWRRU1-mCl3-1DUu0C7pQ,2,0,2,DWsMic0Iyn1npGV8lcsBdA
5806929,2007-06-21,0,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Not so long ago, Picasso was frequently cited as one of the best, if not the best, restaurant in Las Vegas. It has since been surpassed, but remains a delight. The worst of my courses was good, and two of the courses (roasted foie gras steak; warm chocolate fondant with peanut brittle ice cream) were excellent. It's not just that each course is so good; each of the components of a course is good. Add in the paintings, beautiful floral displays, and the Bellagio fountains, and you've got a winner.

The menu is fixed price, offering either a four or five course meal. Wine pairings are available. The space is beautiful, with Picasso's (what else) gracing the walls. Huge floral displays add to the beauty. Lastly, there's a view of the Bellagio fountains. Service is efficient and friendly, and the wine steward does a great job of explaining each wine.

We started out with olive bread (very good) and an amuse bouche of smoked salmon with Osetra caviar, finely diced cucumber, all on some sort of thin baked cracker - also very good.

I got the menu degustation plus a wine pairing - 2 and 1/2 ounces of four wines, one for each course except dessert. I had:
* Jonah Crab Salad: a small amount of fine bits of crab in a very light vinaigrette. Very good.
* Diver scallop: a single large sauteed scallop sitting in a pool of potato mousseline and another sauce. 
* Roasted foie gras steak. This was superb! The best I've had. Slightly crisp, super flavorful, melt in your mouth.
* Turbot with mushroom duxelles - excellent. The fish was flavorful and moist. The mushroom duxelles were also delicious.
* Warm chocolate fondant with peanut brittle ice cream. The ice cream was excellent. The fondant - a thin, crispy, small cupcake filled with semi-liquid chocolate. Both the cupcake and the filling had wonderfully rich, intense, dark chocolate. This was to die for - perhaps the best dessert I've ever had.
* The meal ended with a few small cookies.



Picasso offers a winning combination of food, atmosphere and service, at a price which no longer seems so extravagant when compared to some of the newer restaurants in town.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,8,3,5,EKiugAAw8EdfkGgmQbtEnQ

5828820,2010-01-01,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

My second (and most recent) visit was not quite as good as my first visit, but the bar was set so high that criticisms must be viewed relatively. Picasso boasts an impressive decor, with original Picasso works lining the walls. The daily floral arrangements are almost equally impressive, and placed in the middle of the restaurant provides a very colorful and beautiful centerpiece. If you get a seat by the windows, you'll get a fantastic view of the water fountain show.

On to the food. I recommend the seared scallop, which on my first visit was PERFECT. The second time around the center was slightly undercooked, but given its size, I would think it's hard to maintain 100% consistency throughout. My highest recommendation goes to the foie gras, which was really exceptional. Seared just right, and extremely flavorful. But then again, who doesn't like something that fatty? Fat = delicious. Also, if the poached oysters are on the menu, GET THEM.

One thing I absolutely must point out is their wine selection, which is VERY reasonably priced, considering. A restaurant of that caliber could get away charging much more for a bottle of wine than Picasso does (and I've been to much lesser restaurants charging higher margins on their wines). I would say that on average, their wine prices are 180-190% of what you'd find retail in a wine shop. Example, 2006 Nicolas Catena Zapata Malbec/Cab ran $230 a bottle at Picasso. I would expect to pay $120 or so in a store. Picasso could get away with charging more, but they don't. That is just gravy.

Service is very attentive, but can be a little sassy. Our waiter teased us about the punctuality of the remainder of our dinner party. They of all people should know that when in Vegas, you gotta ride the hot streaks when they come, no matter if they're getting in the way of your dinner reservation.

You'll be looking at around $150 for the fixed menu (prix fixe), add some recommended wine pairings and you're looking at $250-300. The two prix fixe options that were offered during my second visit were $150 and $300 respectively.

In sum, this is among the best restaurants Vegas has to offer,",zLyYIxIdUki7_G7Sff4TqQ,1,1,5,Bo41OvVexKjdA9Gf_XHnuA
5830781,2014-04-01,1,0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"Really enjoyed our dinner here, every meal I had afterwards was hard-pressed not to disappoint. I had the degustation menu ($125): potato-leek soup and pheasant amouse bouche, lobster salad, scallop, foie gras, halibut, and mango sorbet. My wife had the prix fixe ($115): quail salad, foie gras, fallow deer. My in-laws had the degustation with the lamb. We all did the wine pairings ($65/$55).

My favorites were the quail, the pistachio foie gras, the scallop, and the deer. If I were to return, I would instead sacrifice the scallop and do the prix fixe, ordering what my wife did.

The wine pairings were great, definitely helped make the meal. Great service, and hard to complain about dining in a Picasso gallery with the Bellagio fountains outside.

One other delightful moment came right as we arrived. My wife sat down and thought, I need a purse hanger. Two seconds later, our waiter handed her a purse hanger. :)

All told, the bill with tip for the four of us was $1050. We didn't order any other drinks, but it was also fun to just peruse the enormous awesome wine list.",gZ2vJkhyJZVbWAu59x1Rww,3,2,5,lPlTPU0ETKzEngtsROqRxw

I was first impressed by the fact that they accommodated a party of 10 for whom they had no reservation. The gentleman insisted he came down earlier in the day to make the reservation, but it was not in the books. The staff took care of it quite neatly. 

When we were seated for our 8:00 reservation, I was delighted to be seated at the window, with a perfect view of the fountains.  

Lobster salad - good, not great. I expected more flavor. Very clean.
Pan seared scallops with potato mousseline - phenomenal! 
Foie gras - I finally know it's just not my thing. It was too rich for me. 
Halibut - perfectly done. Perfectly. Asparagus done perfectly as well.
Beggar's Pouch - yummy bread and rice pudding (chocolate!) stuffed in phyllo. 

Then they brought out six bites of desserts. After all that food, we just couldn't touch it. Then, as we left, we were given a nice box of mini cinnamon palmiers. A nice final touch. 

The service was impeccable. No hovering, no haughtiness, never felt uncomfortable. The place was nice, not stuffy. The Picassos on the wall were cool. :)

What truly made this a five star for me was the EXTENSIVE list of single malt scotch. YAY!!!! I had the pleasure of having a 25 year Glenlivet. So good, I had to come home and buy a bottle for myself. Of course, it will only be used for special occasions, and will always remind me of this visit.

As I mentioned earlier, the sea scallops and foie gras here are excellent. Heck, there hasn't been anything here that I've tried that I didn't love. Their chocolate desserts and even their petit fours are scrumptious. Other dishes I've tried and loved are their oysters on the half shell (topped w/caviar), their lamb, and their crab salad.

Since this was our anniversary dinner, we started off with two glasses of champagne. ($24). Now, im not a champagne drinker, but it was pretty good.

They have two menu's, the ""degustation"" ($125) and the Prix Fixe ($115)
I went with the prix fixe 4 course meal. my husband had the degustation which gives you five courses.

first course: butternut squash soup with marshmallow. It was so creamy and delicious, good to the last drop!
second course: Sauteed ruby red shrimp with roasted zucchini, artichoke and a pepper vinaigrette. WOW! the shrimp were cooked perfectly and the pepper vinaigrette was so good i could drink it. this was one of the best shrimp appetizers i think ive ever had.
third course: The roasted milk fed veal chop, served with a roasted rosemary potato. the veal was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was beyond flavorful. the potato was so good too. i clearly was so stuffed from the other food, but couldnt help but to finish every last bite. 
fourth course: dessert. i went with the chocolate fondant with coconut gelato and macaroons. the chocolate was so rich and creamy. not overly sweet and paired perfectly with the coconut gelato. the macaroon was great. So was the hand selection of home made chocolates that the chef sent out for us as well.

my husbands meal went as:
first course: Maine Lobster Salad with an Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette perfect balance of sweet and tanginess. had a hint of spice as well. nice and light- a perfect starter.
second course: Pan Seared Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau - scallop was cooked perfectly, leaving him to want more than just one scallop.
third course: Sautéed Steak of ""A"" Foie Gras Roasted Almonds and Rhubarb Purée
this was probably my husbands favorite course. he still cant stop talking about it. he said it was literally like he was eating a filet mignon. it was so tender and so flavorful.
fourth course:Roasted Lamb with mint aioli. The lamb was a perfect medium rare, the mint aioli was nice and delicate. 
fifth course: Hazelnut Joconde with Gianduia Mousse, Vanilla Frangelico Ice Cream, Chocolate Covered Hazelnuts. OMG this dessert was incredible. 

Our server was great, extremely knowledgable about the menu and the beautiful artwork on the walls. very social with us.

If you are really into classy restaurants and really understand french food and have a very advanced pallet, then you should really stop reading this. If you are normal and well seeded in the middle class financially and socially, then keep reading. I got your back on this one. 

You are limited to just two options here. The crazy expensive 4 course meal and the CRAZY EXPENSIVE 5 course meal. While the entree might have 2-3 options, everything else is the same. The portions are the smallest you will ever have. If the menu say scallops, take that as a single scallop. This is pretty normal for ortsy tortsy places. Now onto the costs. Be prepared to pay $225 per person easily. It is one of the longest and most expensive restaurant experiences. If you want to do an ultra classy dinner for a super special occasion, this is definitely your spot. This is one of those spots where you can check off your bucket lists. but be prepared to spend, spend, and SPEND!

We haven't been to vegas in a while so I looked on yelp to find great restaurants and made reservations for this one. Before I continue, I never tell the waiter to bring my food back. I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food. I am no foodie connoisseur so please excuse my lack of expertise in explaining how food should taste/not taste.  

We were sooooooooo disappointed. The food was not what I expected especially with michelin rated restaurant. 

There were 2 options to choose from since it was the holidays. Both were the prixe fixe menu. 1) truffle menu -$300 pp and 2) holiday menu - $160 pp. We tried the holiday menu. I had the butternut squash with marshmallows, kobe meatballs, white fish with asparagus and earl grey cheesecake. My husband had the alaskan crab, scallops, steak and a hazelnut joconde. 

The butternut squash was good. The marshmallows added a sweetness to the dish. The kobe meatballs were dry and lacked flavor. Just a ball of ground beef with no seasoning. Costco sells better meat balls. The white fish (i think it was sea bass or something similar)  was over cooked. The skin on the fish was chewy and wasnt crispy. The earl grey cheesecake was the only thing good about my dishes. 

My husbands dishes were another story. They gave him the wrong appetizer. He ordered the scallops and got the alaskan crab salad instead. He got 2 appetizers for the mistake. The crab was fresh and was really good but the scallops had sand in it! SAND?!?! Not only that, it was dry and again, lacked seasoning. His steak was a slab of beef. Nothing really to remember. Go to Maestros for good steak. His hazelnut dessert was good but easily forgettable.

Overall, we paid almost $400 for a meal we never should have had. It was the most I have ever paid for a meal. I thought by paying this much it would be the best meal I've ever eaten. It wasn't. It was the worst part of our trip and the worst meal I've ever eaten.
