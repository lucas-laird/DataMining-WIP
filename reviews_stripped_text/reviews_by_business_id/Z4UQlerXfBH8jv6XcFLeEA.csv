She spoke French; not much English.   My wife ordered an omelet but receive a crepe wirh tomato sauce and onions on top of it.  I'm sorry to say that it was not what she expected.   I told the young ladt to bring a to go box and I paid $14 dollars and some change for something undesirable.   I felt terrible about it and didn't argue; just paid the bill.  If your thinking of going here to eat, think again.  One would need to speak French.  I'm sure if your French, one would like the food.",uH5waWFtHq8WM_CoA9anXg,0,0,1,bM7i-VjpxSzEDafkDefQNw
1448071,2018-03-24,3,Z4UQlerXfBH8jv6XcFLeEA,"The cutest little crepe shop just opened by my work! Aiming to bring the most authentic French crepes to Summerlin, the modern-rustic interior has major Pottery Barn vibes, with nautical blue and white Brittany flags everywhere- that's where owners Catherine and Jean-Jacques and their recipes hail from!

Open for breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch and dinners, the menu has a good mix of buckwheat galettes (savory crepes), dessert crepes, and a few French classics thrown in for good measure (quiche, croques madame and monsieur, coffees, and baked goods). They have combos that course galettes, crepes, and beverages or desserts, and prices are fair.

Tried the swiss and cream mushroom galette on my first visit, at Catherine's recommendation, and really enjoyed it. Amount of filling was just right, the mushrooms were plentiful and tasty, and the small side salad was a nice accent. Looking forward to inviting in a group for a brunch event to try La Bretonne (Brie, onions, potato, sausage) and La West Coast (Swiss, salmon, cream leeks).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,10,4,db_FHntVn2MgT2Ds6fR-Gw
2257282,2018-06-26,0,Z4UQlerXfBH8jv6XcFLeEA,"My wife and I met my two Auntes for breakfast on a Tuesday morning.  I chose the place because, when I can find a Crepe place operated by an honest to god French National, I have to go there.

There was only one other party there while we were there. Which is unfortunate for the business and for all the people missing out on some awesome food 

I ordered the sweet variety.  La Banana.  It had banana, go figure, along with Nutella, Coconut and Fresh whipped cream.  All in all two ordered Sweet and two ordered Savory.  We all shared a little of each with each other.  I didn't really want to share, it was that good.  

If you love Crepes, you should be eating here.  Everyone, I implore you, start eating here.  I want it to still be in business when I return next!",tHMx7OxcPd7Tu4U3Z50oFw,0,0,5,wmHxyfP0p_J_-CghpbnpNA

I opted for the house caramel sauce on my sweet crepe. Holy wow! It was so good! Both were very tender, not too chewy and had amazing flavor. Will definitely come back.",3il8oQFzvKzA4OgWPxIcEA,0,0,5,mPMOkH4wYCqWyc-__OkWWQ

I ordered quiche, they warmed one and the inside was totally cold! We ordered 3 crepes! They brought two of them (we were 3 people). We finished them and waited and waited for the last one! Then we saw the chef came back with a gallon of milk and after couple minutes the last crepe was ready! REALLY? when I have couple guest I try to be ready and have all the ingredients in hand!

My husband's La Bretonne galette was so scrumptious with sweet onions, potatoes, sausage and cheese. His homemade caramel crepe was oh so good!! Service was excellent and we will definitely be coming back! At the end of our meal the owner had us sample the classic dessert from her region of France which is a flan with plums, yummy!!!",VqE1DsCjNBpCE6XuRqx-Nw,0,0,5,5_q-VMu4gucwuO7MQ7Zknw

The decor is awesome , the crepes are delicious and they have awesome specials that give you a little sample of everything . I'm not a crepe expert it galettes are delicious and Catherine will give you the run down when you come in . The dessert crepe was really yummy too ...

I will give breakdown of what I got in my photos to simplify my life but for a fun experience in the summerlin area at a newly opened French family restaurant give this place a try!",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,8,2,5,FyXIXHsKHnV-5G5D0qa-7g

And...it was worth the wait. 
The good the device and and interior was 100% spot on.
Love when the chef comes out and checks on his food he prepared for you.
Both crepes were excellent could not ask for any better...i believe we both had the complete (i add sausage to mine and my wife added mushrooms to hers)  and we both ate a sauteed apple with carmel and to top it off ice cream... delicious!!!
Will come back and thank you for that excellent service",nh4xURBFqZbBaP1Lzem_Uw,0,2,5,Alcx8tAlMjmcpZj5Oz7LBw

5690558,2018-06-12,0,Z4UQlerXfBH8jv6XcFLeEA,"Oui!  Real French crepes served up in Las Vegas.  Delicious with quality ingredients, good service and generous portions.  Gr8 ambiance and convenient location.  May be too French for those used to fast food crepes but far more healthier and satisfying.  Make your own or choose one of their wonderful specials which will make you salivate upon presentation.  Leaks, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, ham, salmon, sausage, buckwheat-high quality crepes which transport you to the French countryside.  Try the Breton far dessert.",WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,0,0,5,3d6TUu8h9-gOOxGNWCbhWA
