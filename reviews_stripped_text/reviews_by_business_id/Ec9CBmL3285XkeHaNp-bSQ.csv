There were so many good reviews on the bone marrow and oxtail pho as well as many other dishes from the menu. However my experience here fell short. I usually don't write reviews but I thought I would share my experience.

First thing was when we walked in, there was a host stand but no host. There was a sign for patrons to sign in on a sheet with a name and number of guests. Our presence wasn't acknowledge until about 25 minutes later. Not sure if this is a Vegas thing because they're so busy (we had a similar experience at another restaurant) or that's how they operate.

Once we sat down we looked over the menu. Most of the dishes had unique twists on Vietnamese cuisine. But long story kind of short - we wanted to try the oxtail fries, they were out of fries. My friend and I wanted to try the bone marrow pho, they were out of bone marrow.

Since trying the bone marrow was out of the question I went with a basic meatball pho. After 30 minutes the dishes started to arrive to the table. This is also when one of the servers informed me that they were out of meatballs for the meatball pho. 
Are you F'n serious!?!? I mean bad enough you made me wait 30 minutes to tell me this but  those meatballs  for pho ( and French fries) are usually frozen.  You would think.. running a restaurant that serves PHO you would make sure you have some of them suckers in the freezer at least.  Manager probably wasn't on top of inventory this week.

At this point I was getting really HANGRY. Everyone at the table had gotten their food and now I had to look at the menu and decide what to get (being if they didn't run out of it already)
I decided to go with the oxtail fried rice remembering that there were rave reviews on the dish on Yelp. The dish came out about 15 minutes later and let me tell you... I thought you couldn't really mess up fried rice but.. this was pretty horrible. I don't know if they forgot to season it bc they were in a hurry to push it out since they didn't have any ingredients left in their kitchen for any other dish on that menu or what but.. it just tasted like i was eating steamed white rice with onions. Because there was a lot of white onions in it with maybe a bit or a shred of oxtail meat here and there. 
I ended up having to season the rice with whatever condiments they had at the table, which wasn't much. I should have known- any Vietnamese restaurant that doesn't have fish sauce or soy sauce on the table as a condiment should be a warning sign.  

I don't know..maybe we went at the wrong time or maybe that's just how they roll.. but I would not recommend this place to anyone- not even hipster foodies. This place is just overrated and over priced.",pwDckoLjvf0E5nyVt3RSHg,1,0,1,eIeYOS3sYJacXgdtX3gf6w

30139,2015-08-30,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"I just had the worst experience here. It started with a cluster of a mess waiting for a table since there was no hostess or waitlist. We saw another aggravated couple seat themselves at the bar so we did the same. We ordered egg rolls, chicken pho, and rice combo. Simple enough right? No lobster this, no oxtail that. 

Am I suppose to ask for my side garnishes when ordering pho? Accept my apology if it's suppose to be ordered a la carte. My pho came out first and sat there as I tried to flag down any staff member. Fifteen minutes later, my boyfriend's rice combo comes out so we asked the food runner for the garnishes for my pho and fish sauce for his rice. By the time that came out, she brought along the eggrolls. I'm not even upset about the sequence of the food but damn, 2 of 4 of my eggrolls were soggy because it was placed under all the wet greens. I asked for our check since we seem to be adding on to the masses that were stressing out the staff. I am in the restaurant industry so I totally understand, but for such a beautiful business opportunity... staff up, get more organized, and be consistent. Smile even if you're stressed from all the big tops, I lived in Vegas prior and learned to treat the tourists kindly. This might be their first and only time out here so make their experience amazing. 

I couldn't eat anymore because I was just so upset with the experience. I was really hoping for a good last lunch before my flight. This just ruined it for me.",bQqvAPzsBsUm91BhZaM5Og,0,0,1,6E1jjcC5iJw63PBEVDvnSQ

They didn't bring us enough menus. The first time we came in, the server brought over the specials board and suggested different items since we had never been there before. This time, we had to ask about the specials and he didn't even bring the board, he mentioned the few that he could remember. We saw all the other servers bringing the specials board to the tables. Our share plates WERE NOT WASHED! They had food remnants from the last guests. When they brought ""new"" ones, they were also dirty! We asked for everything to be brought out as it was ready. We placed our order at 6:40, by 7:25 we had not received the appetizers or my sister's meal. We had to ask the manager and then the server about the missing items. When the pork buns finally came out, one at a time, and they were hard and inedible. By that time, everyone had completed their meal and my sister was not interested in her meal. I asked the manager to remove the buns, she apologize and said she would, but the check was presented with the buns. At that point, the server, Johnny L, was scared, and stopped coming to the table. He wasn't attentive anyways. We had other servers stop by the table more times than he did. The ""manager"", Vy, was too busy talking it up with her friends, to assist us. We were so impressed the first time and brought our family back to try it. Had high hopes in becoming regulars at this place. That's definite no.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,2,0,1,8fsSaRohGqDkf8X4PCumYw

Hate to be so blunt but If this restaurant were in Orange County, it may last for about 6 months at most.  Ordered the lobster pho. It was totally bland and devoid of any true pho flavor. 50$?! I was totally confused.  The presentation was nice tho. The big bone soup was similarly bland. However the meat and marrow from the bones were tasty. We also ordered the ox tail fries. The fries were loaded with meat and gravy. Good value but again, not much with taste. 
The service was good. People were friendly and helpful. The food came out quickly.  the ambience was nice. 
Im glad I did try this place as the concept is good and novel.  However, I would not come back
I have to wonder if the chef is truly Vietnamese or familiar with how pho should taste. Maybe they had a bad batch of the broth. Having read through some of the other reviews, I see others thought similarly about the blandness of the broth.

164648,2017-07-13,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"As much as I want to give District One 5-stars....I can't. First let me be clear: this is a 5-star place. The food is amazing and I love the atmosphere. Sadly...the service was disorganized & nonexistent. The servers were very nice & when ours was present he was helpful but we spent more time waiting for him then we did speaking with him. Additionally, our food was run out by different people at different times - I was practically finished with my bowl of Pho when they brought the veg plate out for it. But the biggest disappointment of the evening: PARKING!  There was none. I parked in the shopping center next to it and walked; my friends parked across Jones & played Frogger trying to cross. This isn't the best area at 7pm on a Saturday night. It doesn't change for the better at 9pm. 

The menu District One has on their website is wrong. I had my heart set on lobster pho when I arrived but when I found out 1) the menu online is wrong and 2) the price was more than whats online I couldn't justify it. 

I really wanted something different so went with the rib eye pho. OMG is was delicious. Lots of noodles, perfect broth & the rib eye melted in my mouth. I hate going to Chinatown but I will just for this. 

Spring rolls were disappointing. Bland. Too much mint. Not sure what the crunchy pork was inside the roll. These are traditionally made with the pork and shrimp on the outside of the roll visible through the rice paper. And nowhere near the amount of mint crammed into this. It had absolutely no flavor and the peanut sauce wasn't about to help change it.  

Oxtail pho I heard was gorgeous, too. 

Shrimp skewers weren't cooked through. My friend is an idiot and doesn't send food back so she literally threw $8 away. ($3.99/each)

Came here for my birthday and overall I was very pleased. Will definitely come back...but not at 7pm on a Saturday night.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,0,0,3,JP3Aou4dvIna14RhRfFLhQ

The cocktails I had were the Vietnamese donkey and the coconut mojito. Both very delicious, balanced and refreshing.

I thought there was no point in adding the pickled veggies in the menu since you barely get anything. I love that the tomato rice had a lot of flavor and also the hen. Tomato rice and hen were perfect. I have also tried their Oxtail Pho. I honestly think there is nothing special about that. The broth is just a regular Pho broth and the Oxtail seemed a little overcooked. 

The menu is small compared to other pho places. I think District one is a Viet Fusion restaurant. They don't have everything a usual pho place would have. They don't offer many rice dishes or the drink desserts. So if you're looking for your typical Viet food, I wouldn't come here. 

I would probably go to District One once in awhile for the Five Spiced Hen over Tomato Rice only. The prices at District One are higher compared to any other pho places in Las Vegas.

The environment is more hip and clean compared to other pho places though. It is very modern I would say. There is a bar and seating is very nice. 

The service was good. I have only gone to District One once during lunch and early dinner (4AM). There were only 3-4 other parties the times that I have gone there.",5RZ7l8EqNJEssIhiEOtARw,0,0,3,CkeqRR-90UwVuGvMRJNtvQ
306123,2015-09-18,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Every year for my birthday I try to find a new spot to have my dinner. With the help of yelp ;) I stumbled upon District One. I decided to give it a try based off all the positive reviews. 

First, I wanted a place that was open late because the second part of my night didn't start till much later so I was pleased that they were open until 2. 

I loved the interior. It's not typical fancy birthday dinner type of decor (but that's not really my style) It was very relaxed, and even though we were dressed up, we felt very comfortable and we were able to relax and have a good time.
I was a little hesistant at first choosing this place because most of my friends had never tried this type of food before but luckily everyone found something to fit their taste buds :) 

Our server Jason was very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. A couple of my friends got spring rolls confused with egg rolls, but they took them back with no issue and brought them back what they meant to order :) 

I had the fried pork belly buns and the beef pho, which both were super tasty! I'm a lover of soups and this one did not dissapoint. I also tried a peice of my friend's egg roll (very good) and some pork chop from her combonation meal, which was also really good and flavorful (she said it was better than her mom's lol). My sister complimented the chicken wings and said the sauce that came with them was very good. I also tried the chicken fried rice: nice, moist, and had a little kick which I didn't mind. At the end of the evening I recieved the coconut ice cream for my b-day treat...it was delicious! My friends even ordered some for themselves. All in all I had a very good experience that evening and left full and happy:) Thank You District One for making my birthday even more memorable. 

If asian fusion is your thing (or if you just want to try something new) I highly recommend trying District One, you won't be dissapointed!",XwIXv7fq6ZGkwbh4BDQdIw,0,0,5,7fjhfd_WdaqtIW7JoXjKaA

327493,2014-03-06,2,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"First we love the decor, the atmosphere and how clean this place is. 
Everyone is very friendly and helpful. 
They have sake on tab! woohoo! They also carry such a large collections of wines, beers and Japanese whiskey. U gotta try Japanese whiskey such as hibiki, oh my it;s so smooth and trust me, no hangover the next day. 
We ordered a lot of items on the menu, overall we are pretty content about the foods. 
Oysters with house special sauce is very fresh, the tobiko on top adds a different texture to the oysters, we totally love it. 
They said they only serve fresh crawfishes. Yup, no frozen crawfishes for me! Their sauce is less intense than other places in town. But i love it, less garlicky feeling the next day thank you!
Tamarin crab was good. I wished the sauce was a little thicker but its still good, a balance between sour, sweet and salty. Yum yum!
Their egg rolls serve hot and crispy. They have taro inside, my favorite in town.
Their beef wrapped in betel leaves are yummiest. You can taste the lemon grass in every bite. It's very moist and well seasoned. It goes so well with the green onion and peanuts on top.
We tried the pho oxtail and both agreed that its totally authentic. The broth is richer than other places, not too strong of the pho spices. It is not easy to make a good pho broth, you can kill it when putting too much spices. This place got it right, got it right!
Oh and their beef carpaccio, I have never had it this way before. The truffle oil is such a smart move. I enjoy every bite of it, the beef melts in my mouth.
Overall there are some room for improvement but for such a new opening place, it deserves a five stars.",-90-_Cah8QiB9efPgDUE_A,2,2,5,oL4U4-K4y6pfnJWT93W13g
328553,2015-08-30,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Love the ambiance and location (don't dig that parking is 60 minutes max and impossible to find on a weekend), and the greeters got us seated immediately on a busy weekend. The food is a swell Asian fusion that is cheaper than expected for a swanky industrial-club like atmosphere (seems like a great place to bring a first-date). However, the food was not as OMG as some of the yelp reviews had persuaded me to believe. My steak and egg rice plate was not bad, and the portion size of stir-fried beef, a soft-fried egg, and ketchup fried rice was just right. But the flavors were just okay, about on par with any decent Chinese restaurant. But for $14.95 (their online menu prices are out of date), I wasn't blown away. Our party of six stayed well past finishing our meals, and the servers were attentive and didn't rush us. There was a server error however, where we ordered the oxtail fries but they mistakenly brought us something that may have been garlic fries. We ate a few before we noticed the mistake, and when we let the server know, he took the half-eaten garlic fries away and made us wait for the correct order. I know it varies from place to place, but I'm used to servers leaving the wrong dish on the table as a comp when they make a mistake--especially when it's an appetizer that they're just going to throw away anyway (hopefully \:0 ). Oh well. When the oxtail fries finally arrived, they smelled great--but honestly, they weren't anything really revelatory. I assume their fries aren't fresh-cut. They seemed frozen, but I could be wrong. Their service was fast and friendly, and the prices were okay, and they have that hipster factor going on. I'm not opposed to going back--would like to try out their spin on pho.",OKdLRP7nWMXHVHqPrkJUyA,0,0,3,wR3dIsKqAijWzoZRrO5rrA
340272,2014-07-15,11,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"I obviously don't ""get this place"" while I appreciate the decor the food leaves a ton to be desired.  Honestly I don't care if I am eating at a bus stop out of a paper hat if the food is good I will eat there every day.  This is literally the reason I hate trying new places.  When I arrived for a late lunch around 2pm the place was pretty busy. I later put two and two together and figured the only people drinking a bottle of Veuve on a Monday afternoon would be the owner and his friends.  

I ordered the rib eye pho, I may not be an expert but I have had pho at more than 20 places in Las Vegas and LA including staples like Pho Kim Long.  The pho at District One tasted like they took beef jerky from Wal-Mart and soaked it in hot water then threw in some ""Fresh vegetables"" also from Wal-Mart with maybe a dash of MSG but certainly not enough to add any flavor.  It was the worst Pho I have ever had. Period. I am writing this review absolutely starving because I took two bites and realized that even the entire bottle of cheap Hoisen sauce couldn't improve the flavor.

When I told the server it wasn't good and I just wanted a box and the check (In hindsight I don't even know why i would bother taking it to go.) She didn't include any utensils or sauces so she must have imagined I would just throw it out. She did give a half hearted apology and offer something different however I was so disgusted with the food so far I couldn't picture anything else on the menu edible.

Here is the worst part of the entire experience, I believe the level of ineptitude transcends anything thing the ""chef"" could ruin in the back of the house. So I have already voiced my frustration with how awful the food is and I am actually offering to pay for it as opposed to just walking out and telling them where to stick it. I put my debit card in the $8 check and she promptly returns to inform me there is a $15 minimum on CC transactions. REALLY? Do I have cash? No... I don't have cash.

I will go ahead and lay out the reasons why this pisses me off so much.

1. $15 dollar minimum! Seriously?  This is illegal according to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill

(3) LIMITATION ON RESTRICTIONS ON SETTING TRANSACTION MINIMUMS OR MAXIMUMS.  (A) IN GENERAL.--A payment card network shall not, directly or through any agent, processor, or licensed member of the network, by contract, requirement, condition, penalty, or otherwise, inhibit the ability (i) of any person to set a minimum dollar value for the acceptance by that person of credit cards, to the extent that (I) such minimum dollar value does not differentiate between issuers or between payment card networks; and (II) such minimum dollar value does not exceed $10.00

2. This is stupid, what do you think their average transaction for lunch is? I'm going to go ahead and say their average check is just under $15. You are only going to piss people off with these kinds of restrictions. This may have flown 15 years ago but when the lady selling tamales out of her van started accepting credit cards on her iPhone it made this place look ridiculous.
When McDonald's started allowing credit card payments, they found that the average purchase size increased from $4.50 to $7.00 (source: NPR). A broad study across multiple industries conducted by Dunn & Bradstreet found that purchase sizes were 12% to 18% more when paid for with credit card.

3. I am obviously already having a bad experience, why not just proactively handle the problem and when you drop off my check let me know ""for next time""?  Would it really have been that hard for her do think autonomously without me needing to get more upset than I already was?

In conclusion: Don't go here. It isn't worth the hassle or frustration, maybe the owner should put down his noontime Champaign and get in the kitchen. I don't know what else can save this place from becoming yet another mediocre eatery in a city that deserves better.",yAPgJWysjkStwZgjcvg-FQ,6,2,1,PdXFUVpIyd8TDX6v2Jjmyw

In my opinion, not the best managerial customer service.  But I digress...we arrived during Happy Hour, so I ordered two orders of the pork belly baos and one order of the tamarind chicken wings.

This gives the illusion that there is no drop off/step down when in fact the drop off is over a foot deep between the step off and the handrail. The whole purpose of a rail is for people to hold onto it and to prevent them from falling off of a ledge. Here, if you reach for the handrail, you fall off the ledge. One member of our party who had recently undergone knee surgery, almost fell off the platform due to the handrail illusion which would have been disastrous.

The experience that I had wasn't as close to what others may have gone through. I came here with my boyfriend a little before noon way before the crowd even started to come in. We had ordered the pho nam, braised pork belly and egg rolls. The pho nam wasn't as great as expected. When coming to a vietnamese restaurant, you'd think the flavor would have some tradition in there and not a bland flavor. It seemed as though the broth was altered and not as delicious as you'd expect. As I waited for my dish to arrive, the braised pork, we started to notice that the other customers who came way after we ordered started to get their dish before mine. We asked the waiter/waitress where my order was as it had already been ten minutes after the pho came out. They said there was a back order in the kitchen. How the heck is there a back order when no one was there yet when we ordered?! great cover up...but not really because we told them there was no one here when we ordered and they just looked stumped......... by the time it finally did arrive which was 20 minutes later.... the food looked like it had been sitting under the warmer the whole time and so did the taste of it. 

For a place that received so many great reviews, highly disappointed. Rather go to their parent company Pho So 1 which actually makes great food and has the food come out in time instead of making up excuses. The Only Reason they are getting two stars is because they decided to give us 15% off our meal. So for that they get an extra star.",naNE3ZTHAifPrjc2_Lnf1Q,0,0,2,vB-J0z88vAT1ZvrPxE1PdQ

Spring rolls - These were really good. I really enjoyed that they put the crunchy eggroll wrap in there that usually is in nem nuong. 

Pork belly buns- My favorite thing here! The buns were delicious and the pork belly slices were melt in your mouthhhh. 

Garlic noodles - I added chicken for 3.00. This was my entree but the most disappointing. The noodles were p bland and flavorless with only a hint of garlic and the chicken did not make it any better. I had to add soy sauce.. Incredibly disapointing, I would not recommend this at all.

We looked over the menu and figured out what we wanted fairly quick.  We waited a little long to get our orders taken, which was odd, because it seemed like there were more workers than customers! When we looked around seriously each table had a worker tending to them!! One of the managers (I assume) went up to us to apologize about someone not helping us and got someone to take our orders right away. I appreciated that. The service was great after that! 

On to the food, we had the pork belly buns and the fish tacos for our appetizers. Both were delicious. Just wished they were bigger or served more in a dish, but that's my inner fatty talking! My boyfriend had one of their steak dishes which he said he enjoyed! I had the slow braised pork belly in young coconut juice. That dish was soooo good! I love pork belly and that meat was so flavorful and melted in my mouth!! It was on point!!! 

I would definitely check this spot again and try their other dishes!!",HFMaZHHKEYegGIyGRyrcvA,1,0,4,FuBnvdXaGsxzXnEEbclQeg

REALLY looking forward to them getting their liquor license because the meal warranted some serious beer. 
Our server was excellent and attentive. 

A few gentle suggestions since I know they are brand new: 

1. The little pieces of garlic/serrano didn't really stick to the wings. The pieces that fell into the accompanying daikon salad were delicious though! Would love to have more of that flavor on the actual wing or maybe a special dipping sauce?

2. Would love to see Bánh mì on the menu. 

3. Also, could use a delicious baguette to soak up the D1 Goodness in the shrimp boil.

4. Maryland blue crabs added to the seafood boil menu when in season.

The grilled squid with spicy mayo and sea snails in an aromatic broth.

I really wanted to like both dishes, but a few minutes too long cooking proved both items to be a bit chewy and less enjoyable.  The flavors for both were quite enjoyable.  The broth of the sea snails was exceptional despite the chewy shell inhabitants.  The squid remainded me or the same I saw in travels oversea, but these were overcooked a bit too much.

Another friendly and knowledgable bartender provided an upbeat, casual environment providing some other dining options for us to try.

The atmosphere is really great when you walk in. Cute decoration and definitely brings a modern look to a Pho restaurant! Big plus because it doesn't terribly smell like Pho and have you worrying about your clothes when you walk out! They give you the option to either sit at a booth, open tables, bar or in a section somewhat closed off for tables.  The first time we came we asked for some recommendations and were encouraged to try out the lobster pho at $27.99 and yellowtail ahi tacos at $8.99, so we went ahead and did that. The tacos were soooo good. However, it was pricy for only only three small tacos. So I guess it really depends on what you are looking for: quality vs. quantity. The lobster pho was ok as far as taste (didn't wow me like I would expect) but the idea and look of the plate was cool. as far as the service, our waiters were great and very informational on the menu. I was a little distraught with. who I think, was the owner or manager. Both times I came to the restaurant, she spent more time trying to impress the ""big buyers"" and didn't stop to see how the other tables were doing even though those customers were right next to them. So that docks my service review a little. I also mentioned it to a friend of mine and she mentioned she noticed it the few times she went of the selective service. So for my review the first time around, I give the restaurant a 3 for food and 4 for service!

My second time later that week I brought my family and ordered the oxtail soup and hue spicy beef noodle soup for me and the BF. Defffff redeemed themselves this second time around. I loved both soups and the oxtail was so soft it basically just came off the bone easily (I'm sorry no pictures for the second time around tho!). The service was all around the same as the first - good waiters, manager tended or paid notice only to other higher paying customers. But all in all, second time rating is a 5 for food and 4 for service!

1126428,2014-07-14,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"For some reason this place reminds me of an asian Yardhouse. It has the whole bar set-up and then tables all over. One thing my Bf & I noticed was that there were a TON of waiters/waitresses. It was kind of bizarre as there were about 20 of them.. and it seemed like they knew all the customers or something as they were basically hanging out at their tables. Another thing I found weird is not everyone who worked there was dressed the same -- most were in their assigned Tshirts/uniform/whatever, but some girl was in a romper & another guy in baggy shorts & a T. Highly confused here. I am assuming that we came in at a less busy time.. and that this place is probably a popular hangout place as it gets later. We ordered a few things on the menu, and I wouldn't say anything was terrible, but everything was extremely average.



stir-fried dunginess crab in tamarind sauce -- That day they were offering the crab with spicy aioli sauce.. I prefer spicy to sweet/sour (tarmarind) so naturally I wanted to try the crab with the spicy aioli. In my state of hunger and excitement to try everything, I didn't realize they had brought out the wrong dish -- the crab with tamarind sauce! I already had my fingers shoved in the crab legs (which were of decent size) and a few crumpled up napkins (in attempts to contain the mess which comes with cracking crab claws) when I realized everyone at the table diagonal to ours was staring at me. The duration of this staring was equivalent to the amount of time it took me to consume about two crab legs.. obviously I felt awkward as 1)there is no classy way to eat crab legs in public 2)how do you not feel awkward when the table next to you is essentially gawking. Was I supposed to offer them some? Then it hit me --- the waiter had brought me their crab legs. It all made sense when the four of them got up and left less than 5 minutes later. 

Welll - my apologies for eating your crab legs, but in all seriousness you guys didn't miss out on much. I didn't think they were that fresh, and for the price it wasn't worth it.

Shigoku oysters -- The oysters were probably my favorite of everything we ordered. They were fresh & I loved the flavor. Not much else to say other than.. if you are an oyster lover like me, try these!

Pork belly buns with peanut sauce -- this was pretty average. Buns weren't fluffy.

Fish tacos with yellowtail, avocadi, cilantro, tomato  --- Again, average.

Whole grilled squid --  I always order this when I see it on a menu so I had high expectations of this.. Sadly I was disappointed as it was way too tough. Almost sent it back (and we NEVER send things back), but I guess we were in a good mood that day.

Bun bo hue - This was good. The broth was full of flavor, but for some reason it really irritates me when they don't serve it with the blood cubes as advertised. I know some pho places will ask you if you've ever had them before (and if you say no they automatically assume you won't like it so they don't include it) but at least they ask! I don't have any real complains about this, but if I were really craving bun bo hue, I would probably just go to an actual Pho place for it.

This place didn't WOW me as much as I had hoped it would. I want to say I'd be back, but I don't know. Maybe.",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,0,1,3,yBdl4g76aMZfbsSm2WcVmw

A modern, hip take on a pho restaurant, District One offers items that take it up one level.  They are known for their lobster pho, which features a whole in the bowl!  It's quite tasty, and the broth has a delicate balance of traditional pho and the exquisite flavor of lobster!  However, set at market price, it has pretty hefty price tag, typically above $40 a bowl.  I recommend getting a bowl for the table and sharing it along with another item per person.

The Bone, which features a hearty serving of bone marrow in pho broth is a delicious go to! Use a straw to slurp the marrow out!!! Does not come with noodles.  If you are looking for something more traditional, the Oxtail Pho will hit the spot.  Speaking of oxtail, the oxtail fried rice is one of my favorite things here!

Brought here for a cute little date night, the mister ordered for us (since he had been here before). We didn't really do our usual his/hers order, but shared everything:

We ordered:
- CRISPY EGG ROLLS: Four fried eggrolls cooked to perfection served with large lettuce leaves with all the fixins like pickled carrot and mint leaves. Wrap an eggroll with the lettuce, sprinkle some of the garish and dip in the side sauce. The perfect appetizer!
- THE ORIGINAL WHOLE MAINE LOBSTER PHO: This is listed as market price and was about 50$, but so worth it if you are a lobster lover! A generous 1.5 lbs whole maine lobster in a yummy lobster pho broth with rice noodles. A foodie must try!
- CRISPY BIRD'S NEST NOODLE: Chicken, beef, shrimp, fishballs and assorted vegetables on top of a full plate bed of crispy noodles, softened by a delicious gravy. This was so good and filling, and only 14.99!

Everything was not only presented well, but was extremely full of flavor. We left full and satisfied for sure! Service was good as well... And would we return again? Oh, absolutely! 

Maybe the only downfall was we waited for seating for a good 20 minutes despite there being a lot of seating. I originally asked if a booth was available and the hostess told me she would let me know. 5 minutes later she asked if we still wanted to wait for a booth or were okay with a table, as there still were none.

Overall, the pho was the highlight and very delicious but other items weren't as flavorful and just missed the mark a little bit.  Here's a break down:

Fish taco: just ok, kind of fishy but it was a good concept.  Needed a flavorful relish or something else.

Spring rolls: crunchy and the garnish (perilla leaf, lettuce, mint) was amazingly fresh and abundant. (I hate it when they only give you one perilla leaf or mint).  But the radish and carrot chips could've been marinated longer.

Manila clams: good and full of clammy goodness but again, not super flavorful.  Lacked salt and maybe more herbs.

Cornish game hens: well cooked, sauce was good, tomato rice could've had more flavorful.

Ribeye and flank pho: we got this just to see how their standard pho was and it was deeeelicious.  Beefy broth with a hint of sweetness.  As with everything else the garnishes were super fresh.  Tender meat, and a lot of it.  It definitely makes me want to try more of their pho.

Service:  I don't care about service that much especially because service at a lot of Asian spots on spring mountain is almost non-existent but this place was just odd.  Our wait staff were all young and very nice, but you could tell they lacked experience.  They sort of seemed to want to talk to each other and hang out with their friends who were sitting at another table.  One time we wanted another beer and tried to make eye contact with one of them and he just looked at us and waved awkwardly and turned around and sat down so he can talk to his friends some more...was hilarious and very weird.   And then 3 of them cleared our table but none of them offered to get us our check.  It's like if I opened a restaurant and hired my little brother and let him hire all his friends.

Sadly, this was a huge disappointment. We were all sober, so this is not a biased review. 

With a party of 6, we ordered:
1) Pho oxtail: 3/5 eh, okay
2) Belly buns; 2/5 bleh...the buns were cold...
3) Garlic noodles 3/5 nothing special
4) Oxtail fried rice: 5/5 WOW!!! that was DELICIOUS!!!
5) Fried calamari: 3/5 eh, again, nothing special
6) Green papaya salad: 3.5/5 yum! fresh and refreshing!
7) House special oysters: 3.5/5 fresh! Try it.

I like how they make some of the simple dishes, creative.  Of course, this first time back I was very un-original and ordered the pho thai ribeye steak and the spring rolls.  The spring rolls were plump and fat, meaning they were large and delish on it's own, but their peanut sauce for dipping has quite a bite, nutty and spicy!  The pho thai ribeye steak was a lot, I wish I had a larger stomach!  The broth was less MSGish, which is good, for me...I didn't leave with a feeling of heavy greasy tummy.  The flavor and aroma in their pho was just enough!

As dessert, I split a Vietnamese coffee with a colleague...talk about quality coffee!  The coffee they use is strong and aromatic.  Let's say once I left and went back to work, I was wired!

Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I didn't have too much of an appetite so we ended up sharing a lobster pho and dessert. We also ordered an extra dish to go, fried rice with chicken, I think. It was decent, but there wasn't really anything special about it. The rice was also just a tiny bit dry. That lobster pho was an all star, though! I really enjoyed the soup, which was full of flavor, and of course the lobster itself. It also came with a decent amount of noodles. It was a $40 pho, so probably not going to be a regular meal for me, but the novelty of it was fun. And getting to post a picture of it on IG.

For dessert, we got the coconut ice cream, which came in an actual coconut. It was delicious and worth every penny.

The video made it look so good that we had to try it when we came down to Vegas. Little did we know, their Market Price for a 1.5 pound lobster would be $55.  Okay, no fault of their own since we didn't do our due diligence and called ahead of time and ask for the price. They had other ""Gram"" worthy Phos from Oxtail Pho to Bone Marrow Pho.  I saw some other people order the Bone Marrow Pho and it seemed like they had the hardest time sharing a bowl of it and scraping the good stuff from it. 

My family and I ended up ordering their other dishes from Pho to Bun Bo Hue to Rice Dishes.  None of them were worth the price and definitely not worth the time.

Food wise we tried the tacos which were a hit for everyone and the pork belly buns that were also bomb dot com.  My friend had the rice dish with pork belly and kind of wished that it was larger portion, but luckily his brother ordered pho so that compensated for him not being full.  Other than that we all ordered the oxtail pho and no one had any complaints about it not fulfilling their expectations.

Service was good in terms of refilling water and taking our orders, but it took a while for them to grab our bill so we had to walk up to the front cashier and wait for someone to notice us.

My order came with egg noodles sautéed in wok fried garlic, tender chicken, broccoli, slice carrots, onions, chunks of zucchini and yellow squash, and cilantro. I really love the garlic noodles and how they leave a little crunch in the mix vegetables. It taste perfect!

Yeah, they have other Asian fusion/Vietnamese style dishes, but the BBS is the star of the show. The soup itself is $18. If you want noodles it's an extra  $5 served in a separate bowl and $3 for rice. It took me a good 45 minutes to eat the soup. The bones have so much meat, tendons, and marrow that it takes time to work through each piece of bone. I was filled with joy as I was cutting off pieces of meat and mixing it up with the noodles. The marrow is flavorful and there is a lot of it. You could easily order 2 bowls of noodles and split the big bone. 

We did order some appetizers. Belly buns and  spring rolls. Buns were tasty. I would order again. The spring rolls were good but I have had better. 

It was kind of weird how they brought out our food. There was a large party of about 20 people and about a half full restaurant, so our orders were coming out sporadically. They brought my wife's dish out and the noodles for my soup before the appetizers. Then the belly buns came out, but no soup for me. Finally, the soup showed up and my wife was pretty much done with her dish. Then a few minutes later the spring rolls showed up. I took away a star for the kitchen service. The server, Blanca was nice and she apologized for the service. I understand. It was a little inconvenient but the BBS made up for it. 

Drinks were good. The Hennessey Cafe Sua Da was excellent. Slow dripped Vietnamese coffee with Hennessey over ice for $15. Well worth it. Plus it gave me a nice pick me up after a long day in the sun. 

I did appreciate Blanca and her kindness during our visit. She was excellent at her job and made us feel welcome. 

Great place to visit if you're looking at getting away from the strip. With tip we paid just over $100. There are also some kareoke spots in the shopping center and near the Chubby Cattle if you are looking for Korean bbq. We took a Lyft frim the Orleans and it was a 5 minute drive.

It looks like, food wise, a lot of the kinks have been ironed out since opening. Fortunately, I was able to come here during HH, and I can proclaim that D1 has one of the best food HH in town. I agree that the .50 cent chicken wings are a bit on the smaller size, but they are tossed in this awesome asian glaze that's loaded with these delicious roasted Serrano peppers. And DO get the beef carpaccio! It's all that and a bag of chips! Tender, meaty slices of raw beef tossed in this sweet and sour soy marinade..  Can you say heaven? I liked the mango salad, it was extremely bold with garlic and fish sauce that complimented the delicate ness of the mango and vegetables. Oh, and the oxtail fries? Better than Bachi. Game over.

Let's talk about the pho. Now, it's hard to find a good pho in Vegas. Let's keep it real. But D1 has the best one in town. The broth is very beefy, which I like. The rare beef is amazing, as well as the brisket. The bean sprouts were fresh and crisp, as well as the lime and thai basil. The best part about it was they substituted Serrano peppers instead of using jalepeno. Brilliant!

The food here is 5 stars in my opinion. What killed it for me was the service. Where was everyone? I know we came in a big group, but the place was empty, and they had 3 servers, and a couple bussers. Our water was rarely refilled, and we saw the servers just standing in a corner just goofing off with each other. Such a shame..,

This place has a talented kitchen, no doubts about that. But, they need better training and management in the front of the house. I was thinking about dropping this to 3 stars because of the bad service. The food is extraordinary... So I'll give em a pass. But fix it!! Lol",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,11,10,4,tXQxRq7PMXyimFmmqXthsQ
1437185,2016-11-25,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"It took me a while to realize this but Distrct One was on Munchie's Chefs Night Out. When we got sick of eating the food available on the strip we looked further outward and found Distrct One Kitchen and Bar. We came around dinner time on a Saturday night but was seated almost immediately upon arrival.

What drew my here was the Lobster Pho. Little did I know it was going to be $50 for a bowl...so we decided to grab some quick bites before heading out into the night. We started off with the Fish Sauce Glazed Chicken Wings. Fried perfectly on the outside and still retaining its juicy tenderness inside, the fish sauce glaze was spot on. While pungent, like any fish sauce type dish, it still had that perfect balance of sweet and tangy but nothing overpowering your palate. With the pork buns, I greatly appreciated the addition of pickled carrots and radish that added another layer of texture. The pickled vegetables really helped balance the heaviness of the oyster sauce and fatty pork. And that fatty pork...soooo tender..so fatty...so guilt inducing. We finished out the meal with their oxtail fried rice. For the $12, you get your money's worth with their generous portions and plentiful amount of shredded oxtail. I loved finding the random large clumps sprinkled here and there. Coming with a fried egg helped add a savory texture to the already flavorful fried dish.

Service was decent. They were quick to seat us and explain the menu. Once our order was taken we were rarely checked on beside the refilling of water. When it came to paying for our bill they disappeared with my card for quite some time before returning with the menu. 

Now seeing how great our meal of apps and side dishes were, I really wonder if the Pho Lobster would be worth $50. If they can take items as simple as chicken wings and fried rice to a new level, I'm excited to see what they can do with Pho.",PcBJ693NP4UD-qmvR952zg,5,4,4,7J5auJvycSUryFSd2ZF5fg

I had a lychee martini  - at first they didn't have lychee because they ran out but somehow they got some for me.

The pho-infused gravy was ingenious and the oxtail itself was SO tender!  My friend had one of the standard pho and he seemed satisfied.

The atmosphere is more modern here than your typical pho restaurant, which was cool.  It is also a bar, including overpriced alcohol/beer, but it supposedly has a pretty good happy hour.

They have a great selection of pho, soups and Vietnamese fusion based dishes - not to forget a great drink menu as well.

Rib Eye Pho which was great.  Serving size was huge, enough for two people. The broth was extremely rich and flavorful. They're very generous with the amount of rib eye as well as mint on the side to add yourself.

Big Bone Soup was filling, as well as tiring.  They give you at least two large knuckles full of bone marrow for you to dig out yourself.  I couldn't tell what kind of broth they used, but it was different than the pho. Highly recommend if you're a bone marrow fan at all.

Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio, I highly recommend as an appetizer to share.  The warm oil they drench it in is so rich and it's all topped with crunchy garlic chips to wrap the beef slices in.

Vietnamese Donkey - their version of a Moscow Mule with lychee vodka.  Wasn't too strong, maybe not strong enough but easy to drink.

The oxtail soup was clean. It was refreshing and the meat was falling off the bone. Good size meat pieces too.

We were seated immediately which was also nice, however, their happy hour options were pretty limited and to be honest the food and drinks overall seemed a bit overpriced.

One of my four friends didn't receive his order until the rest of us had already finished our food, perhaps an hour or so after we were all seated. It pretty much ruined our experience there since they had cleaned off our table by the time my friend received his food, which he said was only decent (he ordered the claypot chicken).

Atmosphere: dark, sports bar like with TVs everywhere. 

Service: easy going but attentive. Gave us honest personal opinions and didn't steer us wrong. 

Cuisine: get the CHICKEN WINGS- with fish sauce variation (not on the menu). They are crispy and smothers in a sweet, salty sauce. CHICKEN CLAY POT is delicious. Flavorful but not rich or overwhelming. PHO TIA NAM is also recommended if you like how the broth is altered by adding in beef before cooking. The anise and nutmeg flavors are subtle, perfection.  I would NOT recommend the BELLY BUNS. they are good but not great. They are lacking something bright to cut the fat. They vegetables are not really pickled and lack flavor. I added a squeeze of lime to the last bite which really made the last bite not so boring. 

Cocktails are thoughtful and fun. I had the coconut mojito .... I am obsessed with coconuts. This cocktail is served in the freshly cut coconut used to make this cocktail. It. Is. Delicious. 

Dessert: got the PANDAN LEAF CREME BRÛLÉE. Light flavor of pandan and coconut. Very good but I wish they had a fruit garnish to complete the dish. Maybe mango or berries; either would balance out the dish.",-B9oNLYniI3OV8gZuKVEpQ,0,0,4,YeMTDfAmP8uYQ6qL8SBJtw

The food is pretty subpar. All the ""fusion"" items are generally overpriced and/or not that tasty. Oxtail fries, for example, were hilariously bad at $12.

The more ""traditional"" items are a bit tastier, but with all the Asian food joints in the area, why would you come here to pay more for those?

The drinks, which should have been a good backup, simply weren't that great either. It's interesting that they have so many random Asian beers aside from the usual piss-in-a-cup suspects, but most weren't particularly good so it's a moot point. And what's with the warm pint glasses...?

Ordered a second round and that came within five minutes! Crazy fast, can't complain! Glen is a great chef! Matcha green tea drink is sooo good and my aunty really loves the coconut drink. I always order the Veggie Pho for my meal and it always comes quickly and DELICIOUS! Five stars.",oeGmU6Av0RjzWg6aCJrkQQ,4,0,5,8KtwamLzhWF3UOV_Wgc_HA

Special today was the sea snail and the oysters that had fish roe (caviar?) sprinkled over it. We really like the big bone soup and the oxtail pho. Also tried the oxtail fried rice and wasn't disappointed. The servers are young which normally means impatient and abrupt but not the ones here. They're all nice and polite. Would always come back here and and bring friends from out of town, too, to show off one of the great dining options in Vegas. Why only 4 stars?

We've watched Munchies and thought, we gotta try this place out one day.
Friends raved that this place is a must try, so we finally went.

Ordered one of their specials
-Rice Rice Baby! = Lobster Fried Rice MP $50 - tasty, but we tasted the fried shrimp more than the lobster.  Overpriced.  I wouldn't order again.
-Craving For Seafood? = House Special Oysters (12 pc) $21.99 - worth the price and very fresh and Ono!  I would order again.
-Appetizers = District One Beef Carpaccio $12.99 - not bad.  I might order again.
-Special for the day = snails (forgot price) - very gamy, gritty.  NOT A FAVORITE.  Not like escargot elsewhere.  Never order.
-Appetizers = Belly Bun $7.99.  Okay.  We weren't suppose to order something we can get elsewhere, but i like braised pork belly and we can make better at home.  I wouldn't order again.

Nice workers.  We had two servers.  Younger guy and a little bit order gentlemen.  Never got asked for refills on our drinks, like the people that came after us.  But overall, this place is okay.  Not such a hype.

But they are apparently famous for their Pho.  So next time, if we get a chance to want to go back again, we will try their Pho.",fSVTsXFju-BsxZZejKG4xA,0,0,3,b4iE971jikuPZCi0axPaAQ

One thing we were actually quite impressed by was the wine selection.  For a small Asian restaurant they have very good wines on their list at a very reasonable markup.  Their food is definitely a mix of items that are traditional and ""new"", but everything was prepared really well.  We opted for the special Kauai fried/grilled shrimp was were really tasty head on Santa Barbara prawn sized shrimp with some chili sprinkles.  I had the Hue noodle soup which had a very fragrant and spicy broth that hit the spot for me.  The beef salad was also really good.  I would say the only thing that was just ok were the oysters.  They weren't bad but there was nothing special about them at all.  

Another restaurant added to my regular LV Chinatown list! 

BTW, this plaza is FILLED with great places.  Another one of my favorite places is Shaanxi Gourmet a few doors down. Q Bistro next door is pretty decent for big portions and food to eat with your beer!",IjxJiSab2aQ7gP35jAMh3w,0,0,4,1Ns6WbQm_QDcZC-NcoMbFg

1559838,2014-10-01,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Last month, we saw an article in the local Vegas restaurant review.  It gave it rave reviews.  So, we decided to try it out.

Since that review, we have returned 4 times!  Yes, the place is awesome.  And, we wanted to make sure that we tried all the dishes.  The food is rather unique and quality is great.

Here is our review:

1.  Service - Excellent.  I have no idea why some reviews are negative.  Every time we are there, there are usually 2-3 people waiting on us.  They properly fill our drinks, ensure that our finished plates are removed, and always ask if we need anything else.  In addition, the manager comes around and checks to see how everything is going.  Honestly, usually, services at Viet and/or Chinese restaurants are very subpar.  However, we think District One's staff and service are exceptional.

2.  Atmosphere -- it is a bar.  I think it is laid out quite nicely and not too noisy.  Only issue that I have are the steps going up to the next level.  If people don't watch their step, they can have an awful spill.  Maybe, they can install a little ramp or something... Other than that, it is fine.

3.  Food - absolutely amazing!  Here are our recommendations from our 4 visits:

a.  Appetizers -- usually, we order from the day's special.  
    
Here are the appetizers that we totally enjoyed:
 - Razor Clams -- very good, tender, and flavorful (note: this is our favorite appetizer)
 - Snails -- surprisingly, this was HUGE!  
 - Shaken Beef Salad -- is one of my favorite dishes.  Greens checked!
 - Taco Talapia
 - Roasted Squid 
    
Here are the appetizers that we think are ""okay""
 - Pork Belly cooked in coconut.. it was a little bit too ""fatty"".  :)  I enjoyed it, but the wife stayed away due to the amount of fat on the meat.  
- Pork Belly Buns (same as above)
- Scallops - I was a bit disappointed.  Scallops are usually more plump.  The sauce actually overwhelmed the scallops.
- Oxtail loco-moco something... Hawaiian style -- this was not good

b.  Entrees
- Lobster Pho -- okay.. so, it is a bit pricey.. think we paid $30.  But, oh my, this was so good and worth it.  We loved this dish.  Pho was very flavorful and one dish could be shared with 3 people!  So, it even out about $10 bucks person.  Love the presentation!!
- Lobster with Noodles.  again, this was a bit pricey -- about $70.  I think this was cooked in some tamarind sauce and served over noodles.  Personally, I thought this was good, but not great.  I rather have it served over fried rice.  
- 5 Spice Chicken w/ side of yellow rice.   Very good dish.  Love the spices and the chicken!
- Oxtail Fried Rice (unlike the Loco Moco), we enjoyed this dish. 
Note:  next time, we will try the other pho dishes...  

c.  Dessert (there is only one on the menu)
Nothing beats the Vanilla ice cream w/ peanuts served on a coconut ""meat"" shell.  It serves 2; unless, you really have a sweet tooth.  My family love this part of the meal!

Overall, we love this place.  Service is great, food is awesome, and the price is reasonable.  This is definitely now one of our favorite places.

1560426,2016-06-21,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"What the pho? Lobster pho! Had to try this place out when I was in Vegas for the weekend. When I came here I was a little lost getting to the restaurant. I weren't familiar with the area because I was from California. When getting to the right spot looking from the outside it wasn't the greatest place to be at because it was outside Las Vegas strip, but walking in the restaurant was something different. I love there decoration. And I full bar! A plus for me in my book. Never seen a pho restaurant that had a bar. Going back to my Bowl of Lobster! I order the pho lobster even though they had some other choice I wanted to try but I came here for lobster so I had to try that first. Warning the lobster pho had a market price. So ask for the price before ordering! When I recently went there I guess it was $50 a bowl which was outrageous. But I had to just try it out. When they brought it out the plating was really nice. They actually peel the lobster before hand for you and lay it back out. Wow.. Less work for me so I can enjoy my food. The broth was really good, overall the whole dish was really good but it wasn't worth what I was paying. Will be back next time if I come back to LV!

The only thing that's ""strip mall"" about District One is the parking lot. The décor is modern, witty, fun. The music playlist is an eclectic mix of indie bands and classics. And the food tastes like it should be hand-served by a top-tier chef in a restaurant on the Vegas strip.

My wife ordered the Lobster Pho. She almost cancelled her order after finding out that it was served to look like a whole lobster (with head and tail on either side of the chopped lobster meat), but our server assured her that the head and tail would be discarded. Sans extremities, the pho was delicious.

My Steak and Eggs was amazing! Fried rice, white onion, over-easy egg. The only thing that distracted from the savory flavor of the bits of medium-rare beef was that my wife kept asking me to share.

We loved the sake flight and the extensive wine/beer/liquor list.

Though comfortably full, we felt compelled to taste the créme brulée and the coconut ice cream. Both were fantastic.

The reasoning behind the three stars is that they completely forgot us.  We ordered an appetizer to start off with which we got.  When it was time to order our entree, we were forgotten. It was almost an hour when our waitress came up to us and asked us if we wanted dessert and we told her we didn't even eat yet.  She looked at us like we were joking.  We told we were not and told her we didn't receive our food yet.  Throughout the ordeal, our waitress also failed to tell us that my friend's order ran out.  Why couldn't they have told her that sooner than later when we nearly waited almost an hour for our food.  So my friend had to re-order and ended up getting the Oxtail Pho instead.  The reason we were forgotten, a few large parties had come in and that's why we were forgotten.  It's unacceptable! Just because a large party had come in, you catered to them first when we were already there hours on and haven't eaten yet.  We finally got our food, after nearly going on now for two hours of waiting.  I sent mine back because it was filled with onions.  I had them to take it off.  After all of this mess, it was quite pretty funny how they kept checking up on us every minute and second when the staff nearly forgot us for hours.  My friend and I were not impressed how they handled this mess.  To top it off, we were billed at the end and all we got was a big apology.  So at this point, going back to District One not for awhile until they figure out how to fix a mess like this because it can happen to anyone as well.",D0_ogM5fDGD8bTyzmjaUUA,0,0,3,Gy2HS4VSXPg1_9WvQChE_A

Many of us ordered the oxtail pho - enough for two people. I suggest that you split the pho dish and then order other dishes to try out. The oxtail fries, oxtail fried rice, pork belly buns, or short ribs are just some of the tasty, reasonably  priced dishes. If you're not into oxtail, give it a try. You might be converted - they cook it for many hours in a bone marrow broth, seasonings, so it's so tender -- and gluten free to boot.

I was warned, it's very home cooking if that's what your feeling like, but it was simple compared to the first two dishes.  This was more food than we knew how to deal with.

This is my new favorite find of the year, I keep saying I'll go back just for the coconut ice cream thing and tea but keep going back for food.lol

We went back a second time before she left Vegas, got the carpaccio, split a bowl of pho, and got coconut ice cream thingie.  Then I went back again and got the fish tacos, then ice cream thingie.

Service... people are nice I have to say, but that's as far as it goes. To me they are lacking some common sense or proper eating etiquette. During our meal ,we got asked so many times ""How is everything?"" While we are trying to eat hot pho, how do you expect us to answer you when you can clearly see we all have mouthful. Not only we were ""checked on"" by our server but other 4 different girls stopped by and asked the same questions over and over. Can't we just have a peaceful meal? When we do need them to pay bills, no one can be found!!! 
Tips... by the end of the meal, all of us were so annoyed just want to pay the bill and leave. They have the iPad bill pay at your table which is convenient but the tipping system starts 15%, we really didn't think the food and service deserve that but didn't have much choice there.

The side mission was to find delectable grub and not settle for overpriced offerings on the strip. The answer...hook up with a buddy who knows how to cut through the grime and find us some grub. Who knew we would find grub so good we would come back three times in a span of 24 hours kind of grub because that is exactly what I did here. 

This place is unique. You see the word ""fusion"" tossed around now a days like casual sex at pool parties. But this is fusion at its best. It's fusion because for the most part it has stayed true to what it is. You have your choice of pho here but not like anywhere else. Here a few things stick out like ox tail, lobster, and ribeye pho. Crazy right? Then they have the big bone marrow soup, which is exactly that but hot damn it's good. I have come back three times now for the ox tail fried rice. This is perfection. It's carefully blended ox tail soaked up in every particle of rice topped with an egg over easy. It's awesome and flawless. I would not do anything to change this but ask for more. I tried the ox tail fried rice and put it in a bowl. I then topped the bowl with broth from the bone marrow soup and I think I died for a moment. It was definitely a few moments in time that paused because my taste buds didn't know how to process the information my taste receptors were communicating.

Also tried their wings here, and spring rolls. Those were delicious. I wanted to get to the garlic noodles but I couldn't make myself move past the fried rice.  I'm still here so who knows? Maybe I'll make it for a 4th time before leaving?

Update: yes we did make it a 4th before leaving Vegas. So four times in 48 hours. 

Now you go try it and you try not to come back 4 times. Tell Kai the owner how much you love it and he might just give you shots of Jameson.",VarPmrQsBeeLZ9suKpxYug,4,6,5,fV4-XsbEefWx8CKv0RXgcw

Move over pseudo-Kobe, Now, I have a new love, LOBSTER PHO. 

Ok I know it sounds excessive, but I came here to Vegas to have an entire lobster in my pho. No regrets. Was it delicious? Yes. Was it expensive? The market price was around $49 for a 1.5 lb lobster so it was worth it. 

First of all, I pictured myself breaking apart a lobster in a bowl of pho. So I brought handi wipes picturing the worst case hand messiness scenario. This was not the case. The lobster was already extracted and placed on the shell of the lobster. Every last bit of meat was extracted, I was pleased to find whole claws while digging through my pho. The broth needed no add ons, and was pretty solid. I drank the whole thing and even that the bowl was HUGE this was a lot of broth consumption. 

While the Lobster Pho is a major attraction and so instagrammable and photogenic, there are a lot of sleeper hits on the menu that might not get the attention they deserve, including:

-The oysters in house special style. We got blue point oysters since they ran out of the other oysters and with ponzu, tobiko and topped with a serrano pepper they were outstanding. I'm not sure how I can go back to oysters with just cocktail sauce and lemon.

-The crispy egg rolls with pork and taro were a great appetizer selection. Crispy overload. The pork was tender and the taro was a surprise ingredient.

I wasn't too impressed by the green papaya salad. Given the choices, I would have gone with the Shaken Beef Salad. 

I am intrigued by the Big Bone Soup and Pho Oxtail they have here. If I ever plan another trip to Vegas, I'll be hitting up this spot again.",Tm3SdDX5fa8O6NN-tciSkA,10,10,4,QZ71W2Oa_qqsgsaAK5DVPQ

Fresh Spring Rolls - Distinct for its fried egg roll skin that's within the spring roll and for its generous portions of shrimp. The peanut sauce contains freshly roasted peanuts and is mixed in a combination of hoisin sauce and peanut butter.

Pork Belly Bun - the sliced cucumbers and carrots are not enough to cut the fattyness of the pork. However, I'm sure others would disagree.

Fish Tacos - typical Mexican style fish tacos. Therr was not an Asian or Vietnamese twist to these standard mexican fish tacos. Not sure why these are even on the menu to begin with.

Beef Carpaccio - everytime me and my bro come here we order this. This is our favorite dish here and we highly recommend it. I just wished they would use wagyu :(

House special oysters - fresh, bright, sweet and sour flavors. Topped off with flying fish roe, ponzu sauce, and green garnishes. 

Oxtail Fried Rice - the texture of the chewy oxtail meat blends well with the garlicy fried rice. Medium portion size, enough to share with another person. The texture, more so than the flavor of this dish, is what stood out for me.

I felt like the server could have checked on us more often. 

We order two appetizers: the fish tacos and pork belly buns. Our tacos came out first, and the buns were still missing. I had to ask the server if it was still coming out because she came to bring our entrees which was the pork chop combination rice plate and I had the shaken steak and egg with tomato rice. So I was a little disappointed the belly buns came out last considering I ordered it as an appetizer. Why is it even an appetizer of it's gonna come out AFTER my entree? that why I'm giving it 4stars verses the 5. Feel like the ball was dropped there.

Out of all the items we ordered... All though my shaken steak was great, it wasn't phenomenal. It was a little too oily, although the flavor and taste was great. Even though I will be back for it. I think the one that really stuck out for me... Flavor and taste wise was the fish tacos. I must say it was to be one of the best fish tacos I've had.

The first time we went was at night. I was pretty drunk so I didn't really know what to order. I ended up getting the Oxtail Fries. SO FREAKING GOOD!

My other friend ordered something that was like sauteed Green Beans? I wish I remembered what it was called! That was probably my favorite dish out of everything we all tried. 

They had a wide variety of alcohol and I was so tempted to try the Vietnamese Coffee mixed with Hennessey. But I didn't want to leave Vegas feeling weird since Vietnamese Coffee is already strong for me. Plus alcohol was pretty expensive.

Hahaha I still can't figure out how amazing everything is and the egg is your failure... Isn't that like the very first thing we all learn to cook?! Lol.

PORK BELLY BUNS: Simple, tasty, perfect. Inhaled the trio.
VIETNAMESE BEEF CARPACCIO: Highlight of the meal, large portion for an appetizer with great mix of flavors and textures. This dish is what brought my overall rating up from three stars to four.
OXTAIL PHO: Dish that brought me in here. Simple ingredients, tasty broth, enjoyable but not a dish I feel that I have to have again. Ample meat portion!
RAZOR CLAMS: Chef special, stir fried razor clams in garlic and peppers with a kick of spice to them. Cool presentation, but wouldn't get again. 

Dinner for two with two beers (Boston Brown Ale, so good!) came to $60 before tip, largely due to the razor clam special which was unexpectedly $18. Would have rather had two different appetizers instead. Good place to watch the game in a low-key setting with tasty food.

EDIT: Dropping a star due to inconsistency. Came back a couple of times and dishes always seem to be hit or miss. Recently, their porkbelly rice dish was 99% fat and none in our group cared for their take on papaya salad. The buns are always good, garlic noodles are chewy and fragrant, and the fish tacos are a HH-only item for me because they're good but tiny... but I feel like ordering outside of my few go-to dishes is risky.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,3,2Zina0hckMyJF1i10bQW_A

I made reservations through Yelp on Christmas day for 9 people.  Well, 1 person couldn't make it that day, so I called to change it to 8 people.  When I called, they said they didn't take reservations for that day.  They why did they take the reservation in the first place?!?  With that being said, maybe it was a Yelp mistake (although, they should have worked with Yelp on that).  Even if it was, couldn't they at least make an effort to try to accommodate me?  Even after I explained it to 2 different people, they basically told me they couldn't do anything.  Can you imagine not having dinner reservation on Christmas?  How embarrassed was I?!?

It's so amazing to eat all the marrow and cartilage in delicious beef pho broth. The best part is that they do it tableside. It is perfect for two people to share and you can add a side of pho noodles. It's the best thing on the menu for everyone that I have brought to try. 
The beef carpaccio is also amazing. The truffle oil and peanuts on top provide a nice dressing and it's light and fresh. It's a must order. 
The other favorite is the grilled whole squid. The dipping sauce is a spicy aioli which is cool and sharp. 
The garlic noodles are also good but I would always say remind them more al dente as sometimes it is too mushy for my taste. 
I know a lot of other reviewers like the pork belly buns but I didn't like the sauce and would pass. I am more of a purist where I don't like sauce but that is personal preference. 
My hubs loves their lobster pho with egg noodles. The lobster comes pre cracked so you can eat it easily without being messy. It is his favorite cheat meal. 
The only disappointment is the big bone broth. We have called to reserve but have shown up and it is not available. Or called to see if they even have it available and were told yes of course and shown up and our waitress has said they were already out for the day. 
Today, on our honeymoon in Vegas there was no bone broth. Instead we settled for the oxtail pho with no noodles. I thought they would give us 4 oxtails to share since we went sans noodles but we got 3 tiny pieces, how are two people supposed to share that esp after expecting a hearty bone broth soup? Sad face.

SETTING:

Very modern restaurant. 
Nice large wooden tables and booths.
The decorations on the walls reminds me of seafood restaurants like boiling crab or crab hut, etc.

The waitress here is nice and very informative.

FOOD:

Vietnamese Iced Coffee $3.25
This is authentic Vietnamese iced coffee. The one where you have your coffee beans pressed on top in a metal filter that is placed on top of a cup. Then you mix it yourself with condensed milk. The flavor is a little bit stronger but it is delicious!

Oxtail Fries $11.95
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! I thought I wouldn't like the gravy because it looked very gelatinous, but it was actually very creamy and tasted like oxtail infused. There are bits and pieces of oxtail, but I do think that they need more meat. Otherwise, the fries are delicious!!

Pho Lobster $35
Never would I have thought that I would find a bowl of Pho costing $35 !! But it was pretty much worth the price. They give you a whole lobster! They even cut up all the meat for you so it's easier for you to eat and it won't get messy! The pho broth soup is good, but other then the lobster, its pretty plain. BUT the lobster tastes fresh and chunky.

Hue Spicy Beef Noodles $9.95

This is basically Bun Bo Hue, but named slightly differently by the way. The soup broth here has a strong distinct flavor... kind of like strong mint leaves. The broth wasn't spicy at all. This soup was ok. I've had a lot better elsewhere.

For a place located in Chinatown the place is quite big, modern, clean, and just different from the rest of Chinatown. My mom came here with her friends before and she wanted to come back for Mother's Day lunch. 

We came in around 11am and was seated immediately, our drinks were taken quickly and the server came over to greet Happy Mother's Day and told us about their specials for the day. 

We got a bunch of stuff to share and pretty much liked everything we ordered, some were more impressive than others but not a single bad tasting dish. First of all I was so impressed with how quick the food came out, we literally did not even wait 10 minutes after putting in our order before the food started coming out. 

We got half dozen oysters just plain and half with their special sauce, oysters were cold and delicious, sweet and their homemade sauce was really good, not too strong to where it over powered the freshness of the oysters. We got the Vietnamese beef carpaccio and WOW that was so good!! I'm usually not a fan of raw beef but this was sliced super thing, the sauce was sour and salty, the fried onions on top, everything just worked! We got oxtail fries and oh boy was that good! Drowned in delicious gravy with lots of oxtail meat and an egg on top, probably the best oxtail fries I have ever had (better than the one at Bachi). We also got sea snails which my dad really liked. 

My sister go the Lobster Pho and said the broth was a little too salty, she added limes and stuff and its as ok. Everyone came to try the lobster pho but for $50 I don't think it was worth it. It didn't taste bad by any means but the only special thing about the pho was the lobster. Their special for Mother's Day was lobster fried rice, now this was worth it! The fried rice obviously had lobster, eggs, fish eggs, the sauce was amazing, it looked amazing, smelled amazing and tasted amazing!! Everyone enjoyed this dish. 

My brother got oxtail fried rice and this was really good, a little bland compared to the lobster fried rice but I like it, a healthier and lighter option. I got the bird's nest crispy noodles, I love the way they fried the noodles, so crispy and delicious. I also liked that they did not drown the noodles in too much sauce, the noodles was still crispy towards the end of the meal. I do think their sauce was a little too salty for my taste, but overall still good. 

Overall I really liked the food, they have some unique dishes that really caught my attention. Service was great, drinks were constantly re-filled, they picked up dirty plates and offered to switch out our dirty plates during the meal, everyone was very friendly and attentive. Price point is not crazy either, the whole meal was only pricy because of the lobster pho and lobster fried rice, without those two dishes the check would have been a little over $100 for 5 or 6 dishes!

Ox tail pho is all you really need to order.  We started off with garlic-serrano wings.  Tasty with a kick and fried perfectly.  Moist on the inside.  Also ordered the pork belly buns.  Only thing lacking was the peanut sauce.. a true peanut sauce u get on spring rolls would've made that dish amazing.

Ox tail pho.  Omg.. best thing I've eaten all year.  Pictures don't do it justice.  Just get it.",nBDVESRgWFUDSKD0qVDtcA,0,0,5,tBf3qBBqUJqbieZnQDFwMA

Oxtail fried rice was delicious , steaming hot and fresh with an over easy fried egg on top.  The spring rolls are also a great appetizer 2 rolls cut in half for 4 total pieces a good value appetizer for $5.99.  Enjoyed several wings next visit during their happy hour along with some tasty beers. Sat at the bar late night, very friendly male bartender and did a great job with our group of four.  Third visit was a phoned in Carryout. Must say I was disappointed.  Portions were smaller than the portions when I had dined in with the fried rice and especially the garlic vegetable blend.  When I opened the to go container, I thought it was a joke, barely half full with veggies . For $11 at a local place like this I find it unacceptable. At Joel Robuchon I would expect it, not here!  I almost wanted to drive back and question the portion,  don't have time for that. Previous two dine in visits were great that's why I had returned.  Come on District One , veggies are the cheapest , in your unfair portion it would have cost me $22 if not more to fill a to go box with sautéed veggies :(   please see photo I posted

However, I do appreciate that they open late. The interior of District One is quite interesting. I would say it reminded me of boiling crab but definitely a more upgrade version. The tables were quite spacious which is a huge plus for me.
The service was mediocre, I wished they were a little more attentive but I don't blame them since they were getting ready to close. 
For appetizer we went with their oxtail fries. The fries were on the salty side. I probably won't recommend them unless you really like salt!
As for entrees my friends and I decided to try their pho. Usually when I order pho tai I like my meat on the side because I hate overcooked meat. However, I decided to leave it in my soup. My friend requested to have his meat on the side. 
When we got our noodles, I noticed the soup wasn't really hot. My meat was still pink after 8 minutes! It wasn't even medium rare it was RAW. As for my friend his meat was just plain not cooked. We asked if we could have our phos reheated. They gave us a bowl of hot broth instead which was fine with us. 
Overall, I never experienced pho like this before. I definitely wouldn't recommend my friends or family to try this place.",B7e7gS9fPqKJ0o8hhhwG8Q,4,0,3,l2SIBypba5AzENBIhIzC3A

District 1 an Vietnamese inspired fusion restaurant located just North East on Jones and Spring mtn. 
As soon as you enter the place you realize you will have a pleasant time. Very welcoming atmosphere and not too loud on the decorations. The wait staff are very pleasant and since it's not ""grand opening"" yet you are bound to be seated pretty soon. 
PRO's::
Plenty of TV 's to watch anything. 
Music not too loud which is always good 
Fast food preparations 
Fresh food and moderately priced
Crazy Japanese Whisky selection ( a few that you will not find in the States. )
Draft beer selection is pretty impressive for a non gaming establishment 
Liquor selection is great , high end alcoholic favorites that I will not able to afford lol and less expensive one for working class. Lol. 
They even have a Sake on tap "" how ridiculous is that "". 
I've spoken to the owner and requested they carry Carlsberg ( now am not a fool and know most times owners don't give a damn unless am spending crazy amounts of money here,... But to my amazement the next time I came here. Guess what. my beer ) I felt the love and it's now my fav place to chill and try their tapas style menu and sip on chilled beer and stare at the expensive liquor. Lol. 
Am not much of a sea food person but my wife swears that their selection is fresh and loves the fish tacos / razor clams/ lobster pho/ and Dungeoneous crabs. The list can go on but I'd bore everyone.

I am not one to complain, but they just made their second strike with me last night. My first time I got the oxtail loco moco and my boyfriend got the shrimp with the D1 goodness sauce. The loco moco came out in 10 minutes. It was super flavorful and came in a big portion. My boyfriend's shrimp came out 20 minutes later which makes the cooks or servers seem really inconsistent. Not only did he wait 20 more minutes, but the shrimp was cold, not cleaned properly, and the sauce was tasteless like some unsalted vegetable broth. Luckily, we got it off our check since we were dissatisfied. We came in last night and ordered the wings as our appetizer, the oxtail fried rice, and the braised pork belly. Our server asked us if we wanted to have the appetizer come out first or have it all come out at the same time as the entrees. We asked to have it come out first. After waiting, we both receive our entrees both from different servers for whatever reason. Our wings came out 10 minutes after the entrees which wasn't a big deal, but it made the server look bad. All the food was so delicious, but we noticed that our server just seemed to act like she wasn't even serving our table anymore which is funny because I don't know how hard it is to serve ONE table. She would walk by and avoid eye contact and we kept trying to get her attention by raising our hand and etc. We ended up having to ask other servers for a to go box and the check since we were waiting for almost 20 minutes to grab her attention but she was too busy talking to her friend/co-worker who was standing right near our table. Since the other servers didn't bring us what we needed my boyfriend stood up and acted like he was about to leave and she still didn't give two shits to the point where we could have dine and dashed. He had to basically ask her loudly for a to go box and the check since she started walking away from the area of our table after she was done talking to her friend then she asks us if we want dessert. Are you kidding? She is a fucking joke of a server. Serving is such an easy job especially if you only have ONE table. I don't like tipping badly because I'm a server myself, but she didn't deserve the normal 20%.

I have to say it didn't quite meet all my expectations, but when you consider all the elements: food, ambiance, service, and price, I would agree that District One is not bad. 

Loved the ambiance (lots of room, not much waiting, good for large groups). Service was good. 

The food had mixed reviews in our group. Me personally, I thought both the chicken pho and lobster pho were delicious - the broth packed in the flavor. I also like the rice combo dish. We choose kalbi, which included a side of lop chong sausage and sunny side up egg. Disliked: not a fan of their papaya salad nor the fresh spring rolls. I also didn't care for the vodka mule drink, nor the coconut cocktail. 

Stick to beer or wine, play it safe. 

Otherwise not a bad place to meet up with friends. 

I still think my little hole in the wall mom n pop Vietnamese place would run circles around this place as far as food goes. But ...this is a better fun hang out choice, in my opinion.",I0Z7Piazu88uoHznVAI-xQ,2,3,4,XH4Uh9Wm30PM3oC0Ux55pw

So of course the big question here is, does the hype live up to what everyone says it is?! Well, let me start off by stating that I didn't get their most ordered item which is the Lobster Pho or Bone Marrow Pho or even the Ox Tail Pho (it's too HOT outside for Pho, right now) with that said I will be back to try those items when it gets cold outside...

My hubby, homegirl and I arrived on a Sunday morning at around 11:15ish and there was no wait- we were seated right away. Jennifer was our server, who provided the perfect amount of customer service! She provided great recommendations all of which we practically ordered: 

1) Garlic Serrano Chicken Wings: 5 Stars. Great crunch and a spicy flavor kick. I loved the slices of serranos sprinkled atop the wings. 

2) Ox Tail Fried Rice: 5 Stars. I can eat this all day! The rice is cooked perfectly, there are tons of pieces of beef ox Tail; add sriracha, and this dish is bomb! Great portion size, we shared this between 3 hungry people. *wink 

3) Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio: I love me some raw meat, of course the best I've ever had was in France- but who's asking. Lol. This particular Carpaccio wasn't that great. I would give it a hard 3 Stars, that's it. Idk what it is but the sauces on the meat seemed to have cooked it a bit so it wasn't as raw as I prefer. I love me some truffle oil, but it gave a weird taste. Would I order this again? Probably not. It's not a true Carpaccio dish, in my opinion -also for the price it's not worth it.

All in all, District One offers delicious food in a cool-hipster ambiance environment. I would totally come back to try the Pho!",8drMKNHWavs2g6uf0pLtvg,11,9,4,hNIX5IXqJEmrIXtYxl9wVw

Spring rolls and Belly Buns.

Bone marrow soup
Oxtail pho
Half a dozen of oysters (blue point?)
Oxtail fries

Let me tell you. Everything was delicious. I got here ten minutes before happy hour ended and the server informed us so we quickly got a few oysters for $1.25 each. The size of the bone marrow soup was HUMONGOUS!!! It was larger than our head. The oxtail fries were surprisingly BOMB. I actually wish I had more room in my stomach so I could finish it :/

The pho was amazing as well. I think it is a bit overpriced, but I'm originally from the east coast so maybe there's a general price difference between the west and east coast? The broth tasted homemade for certain and the portion was huge as well. I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in the area.

The oxtail falls off the bone and is kind of delectable. The noodles are okay. The broth is very light and complemented with green onions and herbs. I would've liked it to have more complexity but it ultimately was satisfying.

The grilled Bok choi on the side was a great complement.

If I return, I would get the oxtail fried rice.

Service was great. There was no consistency to who served us but everyone was inviting, attentive and gracious. Can't ask for more from that standpoint.

The interior of the restaurant is more of a sports bar, since they do have a full-service bar at the restaurant. It seems like a great spot to catch a game or two since there are TVs lined throughout the restaurant. The tables are nicely distributed across the restaurant so you don't feel like you're crammed. It's clean throughout the place and the service is exceptional. They definitely go out of their way to make sure you're happy.

I got an order of the pho tai rib eye ($9) and I was really happy with my choice. The amount of meat that they give you is really generous; not to mention, the meat is really tasty and tender.

From the bar: Kronenberg, vietnamese coffee with Hennessey, and vietnamese donkey. Catch me here at happy hour or any hour, sometimes just for drinks. Many times, when I have visitors from out of town, they request to come eat here.
Parking can be hard to find during dinner time or late night due to all the other businesses in the plaza.

Not only is the food pretty darn good, but the place is CLEAN, with a full bar, and service staff that not only speaks English, but is very friendly, too. D1 has my favorite things to eat in LV: pho, peel and eat crawfish/shrimp in spicy sauce, and fresh spring rolls that actually has fresh herbs in it. Kudos to D1 for paying attention to details: gloves, a bib, and extra bowl pre-set on the table for the shells rather than dumping the shells on the table, egg rolls presented on a bamboo tray, spring rolls looking fresh, cut in half for easy consumption, and did I mention the restaurant is CLEAN?! 
On my first visit, I ordered crawfish in spicy D1 sauce and fresh spring rolls. The crawfish were huge and succulent and the sauce was nice and spicy. I mean, my lips turned a shade of red that I wish I was a lipstick color. However, I would have to say that I do favor Hot n Juicy's sauce, but I have no problem batting for the D1 team if they continue to be consistent with their service and food.

The staff is very pleasant and the food is delicious. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is... 

1) We arrived around 3:30pm and the sunlight was bouncing off the cars in the parking lot, right into our faces. They have shades but didn't have them rolled down. Booths line the windows and were full with patrons so it might have been inconvenient for them to pull them down right then. The windows span the entire restaurant though. 


 2) I tried the oxtail pho. It tasted amazing but the meat was still on the bone. Getting the meat off was a little difficult and it was also boiling hot. I don't know if my expectations are too high but I don't enjoy burning my fingers to get the meat off. I tried with a fork but it was too hard. I wouldn't mind it on the bone if the meat was falling off. 


We also tried the pork sticky buns, beef lemongrass wrapped in grape leaf, and ribeye pho. All were amazing! I did notice that the ribeye pho broth was definitely different than the oxtail. The ribeye was a little darker and heavier. The oxtail lighter overall. Both very good just different. This place is a must try if in Vegas!",vxxhCUwihI62cHnWYl-2kg,0,0,4,bptWQzEiFhtoZQ3xhnCpCA

2223211,2014-06-25,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Went for the first time with my friend and daughter. I liked the layout and modernness of the restaurant. It was around lunch time when we stopped by, and even for edc weekend we were seated right away. Our host/server were both very nice, they smiled and were very friendly and was able to suggest. Went to wash my hands and it was interesting how there were sinks outside of the bathrooms. For myself I just wanted to wash my hands and my daughter needed to use the restrooms. Which were very clean and they didn't smell.

I had ordered the lobster pho, Spring rolls for my daughter. And oysters to share with my friend. He had ordered for himself the cube chopped beef with I believe garlic noodles and an egg on top. Also an appetizer of fried chicken. two Vietnamese coffees. And for desert, coconut ice cream. I think that's their only desert for now.

Lobster pho- the broth was good, but not great. I felt like it lacked flavor. The lobster was good too, I liked how they pick out the tail and claws for you. The noodles taste like any other pho noodle, it was not too soggy. However, that was it. It was just a boring bowl of lobster pho. the thought of it was like ""Ooh..."" and the taste was like ""eh.."", Nothing wow.

Spring rolls- I enjoyed the crunch they added in the Spring roll.  But I wish there were more meat and noodles, the greens took up more then half of what was inside. The sauce was ok. My daughter normally loves Spring rolls but this one she only ate half.

Beef w/ garlice noodles- noodles and beef were plain, barely much flavor. I felt so bad for my friend that ordered this, since he was from east coast and I wanted to take him to a restaurant that he would love. This dish didn't do it. 

Oysters- yummy! I really enjoyed this and the sauces and flavors they added to the oysters. Would definitely order this again. Pretty small ones though.

Coconut ice cream inside fresh real coconuts. AMAZING. Never had anything like this before! coconut ice cream with I think green jello on the bottom! very creamy yumminess on top and nuts sprinkled as well. I very much enjoyed this desert and would come back for more. It was not too sweet for me and my friend and I thought it was just enough sweetness. Must try!

I made it a mission to include this on my short vacation to Las Vegas.  Nice little setting in a strip mall.  The lights were on the dim side, making it a little more intimate.  I liked the modern decorations/graphics along the walls.  TVs in every corner so we were able to enjoy the basketball game while dining.  They even have a bar if you just want to grab drinks and relax.

Now comes the exciting part, FOOD.
Appetizers:
Oxtail Fries - 3 stars.  I would compare this to poutine.  Nothing too special in my book. I believe it was $11.99 and for the portion and quality, I wouldn't get it again
Shaken Beef Salad -  4 stars.  If you're Cambodian, it definitely reminds me of Loc Lac without the rice.  Delicious flavor and generous portion size but $11.95 could be pricey for most.  
House Special Oysters - 5 Stars!  Mmm, they were really fresh and had great flavor!  This definitely made me crave oysters more often.
Entrees:
Steak  & Egg - 4 stars.  Amazing flavor of the beef on top of lettuce and tomatoes.  Egg cooked to your preference.  We substituted the rice for the garlic noodles which was an additional $3.00, so the dish came to a total of about $15.00.  It was good but I don't know if it was worth $3.00 good.  
Lobster Pho - 4 stars.  Boy, did I enjoy that lobster.  It is based on market price and ended up being $40.00 when I went.  They give you the entire lobster, head included with the meat cut up so its more convenient for consumption.  The broth was okay.  Of course you can't expect beef broth pho so it was a little different on my pallet.  They also didn't bring bean sprout and didn't have limes so I had to resort to lemons.. meh.  Great food experience but I'm not sure I would get it again for that price.

Service was a little slow, granted we were a big group.  They were only able to split the check 4 ways.   It wasn't too busy when we went, which was a Saturday night.  Dining here was definitely an experience!",vIs11IlLBCs3D_wcqQYDkQ,3,3,4,n7zEwjyr4z6Up7_gG_AlUA

You walk in here and it is definitely a modern vietnamese fusion restaurant that attracts mainly the younger crowd with their style and taste of their dining room. I do like it, im 25 years old, but personally its not what I expect when I like some Vietnamese food, would rather have some average spot with no style serv me some good flavorful pho. 

For their food, most yelpers here probably will not agree, they probably had an off day but I had the Ox tail pho and it was just mediocre. Some of us has the same thing, and others had some appitizers and other kinds of pho, I forgot which ones. 

What I was amazed from my pho was the oxtail itself. two giant pieces of ox tail thats probably enough to feed a lion, fell right off the bone as im picking and eating it. was very easy to eat it. Though the broth with the pho, completely bland to me. When I have Vietnamese food in boston, the broth is usually at its bold flavors in restaurants I go to, but this one was just so disappointing to me. 

My mother also had pho, I dont know what its called but its just simple slices of meat, but she didnt eat any because it looked like it was all fat. Im aware prime brisket is 50% fat but this seem to be 75%. meh...

Also had some appitizers, soft shell crab was pretty good, pork belly bun was as well, but we had the leaf wrapped beef, tasted bland as well. 

For their service, definitely on point. I was with embarassing asian elders who doesnt know the vibe of respect of talking too loud and sounding rude all the time. the server I had was definitely cooperating and it was great, it didnt seem she was bothered. We got everything we ordered and such.

For the money, its just okay, I can pay $15 for ox tail pho, and I would definitely try lobster because it's defintiely something new. but for now, I would have to give this 3 stars for just being a mediocre place. hope they do something about the broth though",_vwgEFSmHnHEnBMeUYZtbg,0,0,3,rC9rfXTAzuo3IjHeejfBJA

Calamari - seemed like the frying oil needed to be replaced, spicy aioli sauce was awesome not bad. 

Garlic Serrano pepper wings - I'm actually a huge fan of these one of my favorite things on the menu. Really tender and juicy with a nice spicy kick to it 

Beef carpaccio - it had been sitting under a heat lamp so the exposed meat was a little cooked, also not bad. 

Combo rice plate (pork chop, kalbi, Chinese sausage) pork chop was way over cooked, short robs were decent couple of the cuts were completely fat, Chinese sausage was good. 

1lb of shrimp - kind of like the hot n juicy style boiling crab ish shrimp boils. The ""d1 house season"" was pretty good shrimps were a nice decent size. Over all pretty good for a 1lb of shrimp.

I kept seeing this place pop up on yelp so decided to give it a try. Turns out, pho so 1's owner's son runs this place! My family and I have been going to pho so 1 for years so when I found out, I was super excited. My mom got to the restaurant first and she was waiting outside.  As soon as Khai saw her, he ran out and told her he'd get a table started while she waited for the rest of us to arrive. What awesome service. We felt like VIPs :P

Not your typical vietnamese pho place. They have the common pho combos and also offer a variety of other fresh seafood items. I got the oxtail pho. It was ~$12, on the pricey side for pho... but totally worth it. My bowl came out with 3 huge pieces of oxtail! It also comes with a side of dipping sauce for the meat. Mix them up and squeeze a little bit of lemon and its delicious!

My sister got Mi Sate. It came out and looked delicious but it definitely was not. It tasted like someone took half a jar of peanut butter and mixed it in with her soup. Way too peanut-y and sweet. Not a fan.

One other minor complaint I have about this place is that my very Vietnamese mother had a difficult time ordering the specific pho combo she wanted. Their menu had the basics. She typically gets pho chin tai nam... not on the menu. Totally not a problem but when she tried to order, both my mother and the waitresses were confused. Neither of them spoke Vietnamese. I don't mind this at all but I know my mom wasn't too happy. She'd be more comfortable with going to a solely Vietnamese speaking establishment so I probably wont be coming here with my family but I know for sure I will be back with some friends!

Love the diversity of the menu also wide range from cornish hen, bone marrow soup, more tradition pho dishes, or beef salad. Just talking about the entrees. 

I no idea best place too start my District One Kitchen & Bar experience but the Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was on my radar. It the perfect soup too clear my running nose and sinus. Boy did it not disappoint! The broth had nice kick too it. But not over the top that not enjoy the full body of the broth. One of the best things about it is diversity of meats in it.

Talking about Buns in my last review Beef Buns brought back that same urge Bun crazy! They do have peking duck buns too believe but went with the pork buns. Talk about addicting get three per order but popping them down so easy wish order half dozen or hell could have done dozen. Really that good!! The pork is cooked nice crispy outside, moist inside, and glaze or sauce cooked in was fabulous could have ordered plate of pork! The topping of think hoisen or oyster sauce combine with garnish of julienne carrots and couple other things. The steam bun itself was the perfect Steam Bun with the perfect filling. 

The service was awesome. I torn between the tacos and beef buns waiter recommending the beef buns. Save the tacos for next time. No doubt be few more times because lot of good stuff on the menu. Just happen ran into fellow yelpers Misti and Bobby. They were kind enough ask if wanted too join them. It was just me doing my yelp diligent checkout out all the ONO spots in Vegas. Lol!! Impromptu UYE with the one and only Misti Y and Bobby Y. Thanks.

2306260,2016-02-04,6,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"I love this spot!  My go to when I want pho. Their super model is the lobster pho... Everyone get your cameras out. My serious guilty pleasure... Hands down the big bone soup.  I am addicted to bone marrow.  As bad as that is I could eat it 3 times a week if I had it my way.  By big it's colossal!  The large amounts of marrow is so gratifying. If you are too shy to get your hands on this dish they will help you out.  The server threw on some gloves and went to work.  She scooped out the marrow, cut the meat and tendon, you are good to go!  Pair that with a side of rice, SO BOMB!  I have been plenty times where the big bone soup is not ready yet, or sold out.  At times I'll call in advance. 

However, when all else fails there's the ox tail pho.  The meat is so tender. This dish is also delicious and satisfying.  I take mine no noodles side of rice. 

The oysters are always so good here with the tobiko. Pork belly is bomb too.  I think everything on the menu is worth trying. The only thing was the snails I didn't care for, too large and chewy.

2308603,2015-07-31,3,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"If you're ever looking for quality Asian food off the Las Vegas strip, you need to try District One!

My family and I came in just in time for their happy hour! (Happy hours are Mon-Fri 5pm-7pm, Sun-Thurs 12am-2am.) The atmosphere is very modern and styled similarly to Boiling Crab, with lots of wall decor. They also had a really good reggae playlist playing in the restaurant.

Our server, Jewel, was super sweet and attentive throughout our meal. She constantly checked up on us to refill our waters or to ask how we liked the food. She was really knowledgeable about the menu as well; a majority of the food we ordered were recommendations from her!

BELLY BUNS - 3.95 during happy hour, 6.95 regular price
You have the option of getting the buns steamed or deep-fried. We tried them deep-fried for that extra crunch and texture, but I've heard they tasted just as good when steamed. Definitely get these, as they seem to be a favorite among District One-goers. I'm not a huge fan of pork, but the pork belly was sooo good and juicy. I recommend!

OXTAIL PHO - 13.99
The pho is a little pricier than the bowls you could get at some of the Vietnamese places deep in Chinatown or elsewhere, but for good reason! They were extremely generous with the oxtail, and it was cooked to perfection; not too fatty, which is how I like it! The broth was just the right amount of salty, and I didn't end up with one of those nasty MSG-headaches after my meal. Broth-to-noodle ratio was perfect!

SHORTRIB RICE - 12.99
This was my brother's order, and I was able to get a few bites in before he finished it all! I believe it comes with steamed rice topped with an egg (anyway you want it), short ribs, Chinese sausage, and pickled carrots/radish. 

OXTAIL FRIED RICE - 12.99
Again, the oxtail wasn't lacking in amount; there were pieces in every single bite. The rice wasn't too bland or too salty. The rice is also topped with a fried egg. So so so good, and enough to share with one or two others. I recommend this one too.

Overall, the food was extremely satisfying and didn't leave me feeling too full or gluttonous. I definitely see myself coming back the next time I'm in Vegas! It's open until 2am too; perfect for late night cravings!

(SIDEBAR: I ended up forgetting my wallet here and didn't realize it until I was back in my hotel room at the Vegas strip. Thank you so much to the District One staff for their integrity and safeguarding it until I made it back out to the restaurant to pick it up!)",2tBJe_QOLfRJ2SMFpJVYbQ,3,3,5,k36dCZvBXZiYWqtADdk65Q

2318500,2015-08-16,2,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"This used to be the Cravin Cajun place. I hadn't been to either but I was headed somewhere else for dinner and this place caught my eye. I thought maybe it would be good.

It wasn't bad but wasn't something I would go back to, either. 

It has an upbeat atmosphere. Everything is kind of new inside so it looks nice. There is a giant chalkboard that somebody spent a lot of time writing the signature dishes but the chalkboard is back in a corner so being a new customer, with so much other noise going on, I didn't even notice it until halfway into my meal. There's also an 8 foot picture of their lobster pho advertisement that is also positioned in a way that only the hostess pointing it out, I would've noticed. In a dimly lit place, these types of signs need a highlight light to get noticed.

The hostess asked if I wanted a booth but I was by myself so, I decided to sit at the bar. There was a guy bartender that seemed to be eyeing me like he was going to take my order. If I sit at a bar to order food, I prefer to order from a server but I've never been here so I just go with the flow.
The lobster pho obviously is something they are trying to push. I decided to try that. The price is listed as 'Market Price.' My personal opinion when a guest orders something listed with this label is that the server should suggest the price. Only after it is ordered. And, this is why...

A woman dressed in plain clothes who appeared to be either a manager or maybe even the owner because she was sitting with guests and overriding the register and accepting a delivery ( which was strange for 9pm on a Saturday night, but...who am I ). But, she casually walked by while I was eating and asked how it was. So, lemme get to that...the important part.

The lobster pho had the full shell as garnish. It was hollow but the only thing that gave the dish substance. The broth was clean and flavorful but was bare. There were the typical pile of noodles in the bottom of the bowl but the entire dish was 1. Broth 2. Noodles 3. Lobster 4. Couple slices of onion...from most to least. The flavor was right but I was hoping for more so when this manager asked me halfway through, I couldn't really give a correct assessment. If she asked me at the moment of service or after I was finished, I would probably have had more to say but asking while my mouth is full is an indication that something isn't right. 

Like I said...it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to knock my socks off. Although the dish is actually more traditional than the Americanized versions that are so popular, it was only so so. And, if the bill is going to show up $40 for the pho and $5 for tea, I would prefer to have known what it was going to be priced because what started as a so so dish dropped immensely upon learning what they value as such. 

On a side note, the bartender was a little personal with his questions. I understand a bartender is supposed to be a sort of quasi therapist for patrons but he acted more like he was a reporter with his questions. And, I wasn't ordering any alcohol. But, he found out that I'm involved in a community event beauty pageant for girls. He told me that one of the servers was competing but, I think he was trying to grab my attention. Problem is, while trying to get the girls attention that he pointed out to me, she was almost running from me. I didn't recognize her but she was in work clothes so I just wanted to verify. He told me her name and I still didn't recognize it so I'm wondering if this is the same as the price of the pho...deceiving and in the end, a disappointment like getting a Thai massage without a happy ending. 

It's a shame because the broth was good. The place has an upbeat atmosphere but the location is bad and the prices are a little inflated for being in a rundown area and getting surprised with a fifty dollar bill for soup and tea kills any good taste in my mouth. I know seafood is not cheap but I was thinking that would be the sugar on top. Instead, it was like eating a bowl of rice and after finishing, finding out it was actual fried meal worms. 

I don't think I'll return again.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,2,2,6J8u3P7-1pvpnyGfWRjn5g

She sat us at a big booth, that was able to sit the 6 of us. We started with 2 orders of the fish tacos. 1 taco each person and they were mini. Tacos were good, but literally were a teaser. I then ordered 2 fresh springs rolls that came with 4 per order. They were your average spring roll, but still very good.
Then we were ready to order, I ordered the oxtail fried rice with an over medium egg. My bf ordered the District 1 combo rice platter which came with short ribs, kim chee, chinese sausage, and either your choice of garlic noodles or white rice. He chose the white rice.
Our friends at the table ordered the Birds nest which was crispy noodle chow mein, and also got an order of the grilled squid which was really gooood and not rubbery.
Everything was cooked really good and tasted even better.

It was fairly empty when we arrived, and they were kind enough to let us sit at a larger table they had already cleaned for the night. The server was pleasant. All we really wanted was to try the bone marrow soup so we got 3 orders (for 5 ppl- 2 shared as it was 17.99 for 1) I also wanted to try the Oxtail fries so we got an order for the table.

Oxtail fries were great- loaded with an egg on top. Not a huge portion to share, but worked fine with us as there were a couple ppl who were not too hungry. If you're coming starving, I'd say it would be a sufficient appetizer for 3-4 ppl max.

Now, the best part was the bone marrow soup! One- it was HUGE. I quickly saw why it was 17.99 lol.  It was also a fun experience as we put on plastic gloves to really get all the marrow and such off the bones. A server came by to explain how & was really helpful and patient while teaching us how to get the most out of the soup. And YUMM it was amazing. My friend put some hoisin sauce in hers- but I loved it without just fine! 

We had to box it to go, even though we shared it! Definitely worth it and will be back. If you're a fan of bone marrow, it will not disappoint!

We took an uber here but there seemed to be plenty of open parking spaces in the lot. The inside is pretty nice. A definite fancier version of most Vietnamese pho places I been to. It's pretty big and spacious and a bit dim. Very inviting, good setting for big groups. The menu is more updated, instead of just pho. So pretty good for someone like myself who does not want pho. They have a little bit of everything for everyone.

_Crispy Egg Rolls ($8.99) Pork, mushroom, taro. I don't know if it's the taro or a certain oil they fry this in, but this was one of the best crispy egg rolls I've had. The crunch from the egg rolls was nicely fried, the inside was fresh and was nicely packed with ingredients. Simple but lots of flavors, it was a tad sweet and had a nutty flavor to it. I loved the greens that came with it. You can dip the roll in the fish sauce then wrap it in the lettuce, it takes it to another level and makes you feel a little less guilty for eating fried food hahah.
_Spring Rolls ($6.99) Shrimp, pork, vermicelli, lettuce, peanut sauce. This was good and pretty standard. The rolls were fresh, the ingredients inside were a generous amount and the flavor was light and subtle. Of course this isn't complete without that yummy sweet and nutty peanut dipping sauce. 
_Steak & Egg ($15.99) Shaken beef, white onion, fried egg, tomato rice. I ordered this, since they did not have the vermicelli bowl. I was skeptic to get this at first since most shaken beef I have are always salty. So I asked the waiter if possible to make it less salty or easy sauce. The tomato rice was good, different from white rice, but just adds a nice little sweetness and acidity to the dish. The beef itself was okay, well cooked and all evenly chopped. The sauce was still salty but I've had worse so can't complain. The egg was a bit raw and runny so they were nice enough to recook it a bit more. The dish taste way better with the eggs, when you mix it altogether. This dish overall was okay, I think the rice and egg alone was the best part. 
_Baby Bok Choi (8.99) Wok fried, garlic. Pretty good and standard veggies. The garlic flavors were great and tasted really good when I ate it with my shaken beef.
_Spicy Pork String Beans ($10.99) Ground pork, chili, green string beans. The whole group loved this. My gg, whom is allergic to garlic ordered this without the garlic, but I guess they forgot the memo. The flavors were great though, lots of garlic aroma, a bit of a kick and the beans itself were perfectly cooked. It had a nice little bite to it, white still being soft as well. 
_Coconut Ice Cream. They were nice to give us free desserts for the mess up on the garlic mishap on the green beans. Presentation was pretty. Served on a small coconut bowl. The flavors were light and refreshing, it had a bit of that icy texture to it. There was also small bits of coconut inside and topped with crushed peanuts. I love peanuts so this added an extra roasted flavor to the ice cream. I will say though, the more I ate it, the more it tasted like vanilla ice cream with hints of coconut. Either way a good dessert. 
_Green Tea Creme Brulee. This was pretty darn good! The green tea custard was nice and silky. A very subtle hint of green tea. The brulee on top was perfectly caramelized and sweet. A small size which is great to just end the meal.

Service was good, and yes pretty pricey for Vietnamese cuisine, but you are in Vegas so high prices are to be expected. I don't mind paying as long as the food is good. Nothing is worse than overpriced food that isn't even good. I would come here again, and try their popular oxtail pho.",1a60tzkZy_9iruwRZl9nyQ,4,2,4,M3_lyA4-VbEiEqny4i36sQ

 On Monday after picking up around rental car we decided to go to District One based on the many recommendations we got from friends and online. When we got there, I asked for the big bone soup which they said they didn't have. I was fine with that considering they told me to come earlier on Wednesday (I flew out Wednesday night) cause they are closed on Tuesday. Fine. So we ordered the oxtail fried rice, baby bak choi, garlic serrano wings, pho tai nam and the pho oxtail. All were nothing short of amazing but I reaaaaaaally wanted the bone marrow. 

Fast forward to Wednesday, I call the restaurant to confirm they have it so I don't waste my time and money going there and they don't have, the female who picked up the phone said ""they have it at the time of the call but they don't have the lobster"" fine I didn't want the lobster anyways. So I call a uber and rush over to district One, ask for the a table for two and then was told they didn't have the big bone pho at all, and didn't have it all day. 

Are you kidding me. I literally rushed over full of joy and left with nothing but hated and a tummy empty of bone marrow :(. It's alright though, I went to Hobak BBQ (review to come) and that was one easily of the best korean meals I've ever had I am still hoping for the next time I come to Vegas they still have this so I can try it :(.

I'm coming back to Vegas in May hopefully it's available then. Will update",QJTC5x9yHycwvZwmYdR4IQ,0,0,2,Hoea4eNJt31UzZku9xvjgg

As of my new year resolution, it's time to end old ways and start off fresh! And that means fresh pho!

At first glance at their menu, their pho a little bit more pricier than most places but the broth seemed to have a little more flavor than other noodle bars that I've previously had before. It's also a little bit more salty for my own tastes, but comes with plenty of meat to fill you up.

I also got to sample their cooked ika (squid) with spicy mayo sauce. It's not bad and has a decently charred crust layer to chewy squid ratio on it. While glancing their appetizer menu, the prices can add up pretty quickly but I'm sure they're a decent discount on their happy hour times. Call me cheap but I just felt for a pho place though, most of the items seemed a little more outside my casual dining-post college grad-hard not life-price range.

The interior is clean and comfortable, but service was slightly slow. Maybe I just came at a bad time? I wouldn't mind stopping by again one day if I'm close by and too lazy to drive elsewhere, but it didn't really seem much to me to be a stand out from the crowd kinda place tbh.

District one felt more like a district three star out of five. But maybe I can try it again later on and have a change of heart?",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,3,1,3,3XQtBSt3ogLzcZQMsteiMA

All and all, the outing to District One was a positive one. Staff was super friendly and attentive. We all had a lot of fun trying the different things. There were definitely foods we enjoyed, and then there were things that we were indifferent about.

Sashimi Tacos - I enjoyed them, but there's hardly any fish in them. Also hard to justify the price.

Oxtail Fries - AMAZING. That's it! If you are with a group, get this and share!

Lobster Pho - I am kind of on the fence about this one. Nothing wrong with it. The dish did taste good, but given the price, I felt a little underwhelmed by it. Don't get me wrong, I totally finished every last a bit of it, but my opinion... let's say it like this... If I had to choose the oxtail fries or lobster pho as an entree, I'd go with oxtail fries. I think this dish is a great experience, but I don't see myself getting the lobster pho again.

All and all. A very positive experience. Definitely would like to come back and try some of the other dishes. 4 out of 5 stars. Unique experience. Attentive staff.

We're addicted to pho hence our regular check-ins here! This is one of our favorite spots in town. Pho Tai Nam is my go-to dish to order. The secret is in the broth and it is delicious. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loves to mix it up. He likes the Pork Belly Buns, Hot Pepper Wings, and always has room to devour those Crispy Egg Rolls.

Had their pho which was actually tasty, good broth. That oxtail fried rice not only took long to get but was so not worth the wait nor $16! It was super greasy and loaded with tons of fat! Yuck! The pork belly buns were cold and dry. Ugh.....
The spring rolls were different....had some weird crunchy thing in the center and some type of herb that I just did not like. And their peanut sauce was bland.

It wasn't too salty! The chicken wings were BOMB. Nicely crisped and seasoned, these wings had a kick to them! For my main meal, I ordered the pho tai nam, which came out in a pretty big bowl. They were super generous with the meat portion too! The broth was delicious and didn't taste too MSG-y as some of the pho places do in San Jose.

I came to Yelp since I'm not familiar with restaurants yet and saw all the good reviews and comments about District One, so I decided to try this place. I was greeted warmly and was given the option of booth, table or bar since it was just myself. The waitress asked if I wanted to see the specials and took my drink order. The specials were actually on a small chalkboard which she kept propt up on the seat at the next table for me.  Since I did come for Pho, I got the Pho Tai (ribeye) and the Surf Clams which were a daily special.

The Pho came out first, and in a much larger bowl than I've had in the past. You do get your money's worth for 7.99! No limes available, but the lemon gave it its own interesting flavor. I've only known Pho from the East Coast, and it pales in comparison to this bowl of heaven. Even the noodles were far better. The surf clam came out on its shell, with some garnishes and hot sauce. I'm not certain of the spice because I didn't ask, but it certainly packs a whallop. If you do not deal with spicy foods, I would suggest avoiding this (unfortunately.)

During dinner, three people came over to help. I'm not sure if it's an LV thing or not, but it felt like there isn't one person assigned to a table but rather everyone helps out.

In fact, upon arrival, you are nicely greeted by a host and directed to your seat within seconds (this could have also been due to the fact that we dropped in early for dinner). The lighting inside the restaurant is dim and the comes equipped with a bar and cushioned table booths as well! District 1 definitely puts a modern twist to the typical pho restaurant. Here is a list of what we ordered:

-Hot Jasmine Tea: Not too pungent, not too bland. Perfect for a cold winter night or if you are sick.
-Grilled Squid Appetizer: Very flavorful and huge portions! Perfect amount of chewiness and flavor. Comes with a full squid (size of two hands); tentacles included!
-Pork Belly Steamed Bun Sliders: So yummy! I wish there was more. They offer two different kinds of buns--crispy or steamed. We opted for the steamed and it was magnificent. Comes with three sliders. Pork belly was flavorful and melted in your mouth. They also have an option to add one more slider if you are planning to share this dish amongst an even number of people.
-Oxtail Pho: Very plain, but still very good. The broth for me was a bit too salty, but the oxtail melted right off the bone. The chunks are gigantic, but the texture of the oxtail makes it super easy to eat.
-Shigoku Oysters: this was a special the time we went. Raw oysters from Washington. Each oyster is $3.50. Man oh man were these oysters goooooood! The sauce they put on top of the oysters were spot on. It left me wanting more!

The service was also top notch! They even offered free beer flights of a new beer they were trying to promote when we were dining. We didn't taste it, but it was a very sweet gesture!

Great location among many other Asian restaurants and worth the extra miles to get there. Very hip, good food. Go explore! :)",R_g7nh8iT_qVUkjtb10gdA,0,0,4,Efm5cLaRh0LyJXAyXRoNaQ

I was the one that suggested it but all my friends loved it after trying the food. I could not get over how delicious the oxtail fries were. And for my entree I ordered the lobster pho that yelpers were raving about, the lobster was cooked just perfect. 
We all ordered something different to share and everything was phenomenal.

2611737,2017-09-02,2,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Came here on 2 occasions: Dinner and Happy hour 4-7PM
A) for dinner- def recommend for their regular menu. Great scene 
Veggie pho- delicious for being all veggies
House oysters- during dinner- Super pricey and not very tasty- btw the 3 of us we ordered 12 and there was a HAIR in one of the oysters which threw our appetite out of the way for the oysters so we didnt even eat them
Shaken beef salad- delicious deep fried beef- very flavorful and DEF recommend 
Notifications stout- Deep and chocolately
Shrimp Bloody Mary- see attached pics- so much stuff inside but not very strong

LOBSTER PHO or lobster fried rice is supposedly the thing to try here: didnt try in- because it is 45$ per order for approximately a 1.5lb lobster


Happy hour: see attached pics- drinks and food (Friday Afternoon)
DEF NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HAPPY HOUR- the food was terrible and not I understand why this place wasnt more busy for happy hour especially with such a nice venue and space. But after eating, my hubby and I both said this place probably had the worst happy hour ever. We actually left feeling unhappy. 
- kronenboug blanc-witbeir: Great beer- Def recommended
- Dogfish Head - Seaquencg Ale- Sour sour sour beer, not for all
-Oysters 1.00 a piece- THEY LOOKED SUPER SUPER OLD and dried out. I returned my first order of 6, just to have them bring me a set of oysters (which looked like the ones i just sent back) that were old and dried out and stuck to the shell because they looked like they had been previously shucked and just sitting in the fridge- They also tasted old (not juicy, not salty with the brine from the inside of the shell)- Worst worst oysters I have ever ordered and I cant believe i didnt get sick after trying one 
- Serrano fried chicken wings: regular deep fried wings- no flavor at all. When they say serrano fried chicken, I was expecting a sauce that would make the wings more flavorful. But the serrano chiles looked like they were fried in oil with garlic and then just pour with oil over the wings- DEF NOT RECOMMENDED- order came with 6 and my husband and I couldnt even finish the order- and we love chicken wings
- deep fried and regular pork buns: DEF recommended and you can get one of each since the order comes with 2 buns

Overall: happy hour was super disappointing but the dinner menu is more promising
4 stars for dinner menu and 1 star for happy hour

Some of the dishes they are known for are the oxtail fried rice, the oxtail pho, the Mekong soup ( I believe it's made with beef, shrimp, fish balls, and pork. Also there known for the Grilled squid and the fish tacos. So when my wife and I took out friend there we offered half the menu, Lol...with no regrets. We had to eat the oxtail fried rice, pork buns, grilled squid and a few other entrees. 

The oxtail fried rice was a bit salty but very unique in texture and taste. We enjoyed it and would definite try it again. The grilled squid had ok it had a few to much of a burnt taste to it and I couldn't enjoy it like I thought I could. The fish tacos we ordered didn't come with soft tacos like I was hoping they would. They were very small in size and reminded me of fried wontons. Although the fish was very small the fresh vegetables on it had great flavor and was refreshing for my tastebuds. 

All in all we were satisfied with our good and the staff is very nice and attentive here. They provided excellent customer service and had no problem helping us with our orders and offer us their sound advice about dishes.

Overall we had about six dishes and our bill was about seventy dollars and that's before the tip. The serving sizes are decent and filling. Another great aspect about this location is that there open from 11am- 3pm everyday.

2628903,2015-05-01,6,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Wooosh!! Out with the old in with the new. Out of the ashes of one of my favorite crab eating joints in the city a new restaurant is born, to replace what was once the Cravin Cajun. I've been through many of meals devouring king crab legs in what once was until one solemn day I pulled on the door only to find out it would not open no more, the Cravin Cajun was no more...

What can come next?? In my small world I would wonder who would fill that void and that space?? Until once day upon one of my travels up Jones I looked up and saw the sign...and it read ""District One""......huh what is this I asked myself....who has replaced Cravin Cajun?!? Vietnamese fusion with flair? Has this been done before? Beyond Phô? I thought to myself ""I MUST TRY THIS"".

I tossed and turned over the loss of Cravin Cajun and waited before trying District One as if it would be a sin, I couldn't disrespect the nonexistent King Crab gods, NO I MUSN'T I would cry out, until one day after reading numerous reviews from fellow yeeps on District One I decided it was time to stop mourning and move on. If other people can get over it then I can to!! So myself and Ellen F. went there for lunch and oh it was good...

I wasn't ready to try the King Crab legs so I ordered their 5 Spice Cornish Hen with a side of the famed Oxtail Fries. I was tempted to try their Phô Ga but why when you can have it at a ton of  places down Spring Mountain (the pictures looked good btw) , let's live a little!!

I very much enjoyed the roasted hen, seasoning was good, rice was equally delicious. The oxtail fries were off the heezy! Whatever the hell sauce it is it is damn bueno. The service was fantastic, I had different servers come up to my table multiple times to ensure the lunch feast was coming along smoothly and that I had an ample amount of water to wash down this Vietnamese fusion. 

I actually regretted not trying the crab legs and other interesting sounding menu selections but due to my time constraints (1 hour) and limited freedom regarding lunch (little thing called work, yuck!) I could not. Next time though!!! As I will be coming back. Oh and the prices are more than reasonable, if you haven't tried it yet it's a must among Chinatown revelers.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,8,7,5,buo3_MjjhdZM0hAIj5W51A

Snails can be done in a few different styles and we picked the spicy Thai chili. It was such a delight. The flavor of lemongrass and chili and spice combined well. Take it from someone who does not enjoy spicy food as much. I'm a weak one but I sucked it up for this particular dish. The black peppered lobster was my favorite and the noodles were wonderful. We actually didn't realize the dish came with noodles until it came out. The server are really sweet but I felt like our particular server was so so.

Had the oxtail fried rice - excellent. A bit greasy, but it's OXTAIL!

Chicken wings - meh......could use a little kick of something either spicy or sweet, they were just kind of there 

Bao - good, missing something to stand out and knock you off your seat, but good

Bone marrow soup - good. Wife thought it was too salty, I thought it was right. Like the fatty tendon and meat you can pick off. Fun and different.

Service was great. Didn't catch her name but she was very active, filled up water constantly (any foodie knows Asain restaurants usually get an F- on this) but she was great! Helped us pack up our take home and did it all with a smile.

Cost wise it was fair. Chicken wings were a bit expensive for what you got, fried rice was well worth the 8 bucks and the soup and bao were fair.

More than anything this place can clean your standard Asain food palette with something different. Will come back and order the fried rice and soup.",Lgknndzb2nfGcHrLMySQBw,0,0,4,svVpK0ZufA22ZM17f_6NKA

I tried the Yellowtail fish tacos off their HH menu and OMG these were amazing.    Though appearing quite small when they serve the two tacos to you, the flavor of the yellowtail, avocado, cilantro, cherry tomato, and lime was out of this world.   I wanted to get 2 more orders of these.. but alas, I had to try other things.

The shrimp papaya salad was good.   It would have been great if it came with those flat shrimp chips that I've been used to back in Chicago.   Something to balance out the tanginess of the dish.

They must really know how to make very good pork belly because we ordered it two ways and both dishes were fantastic.  The pork belly in the steamed buns were yummy, bite size treats.  The other dish, Slow-Braised Pork Belly in young coconut juice was just so soft and tender and it came sitting in the sauce w/ a boiled egg as well.  


There were plenty more unique offerings to try and they also offered a variety of Pho/Soups on the menu.  One thing I'll come back to try some time is their Lobster Pho.  I keep hearing about it and I want it!

I didn't like the lobster pho as much because I expected the broth to have some lobster or seafood taste to it. It was a good base for regular pho, but not good enough for lobster pho. I wish there was more seafood/freshness in its broth. It just felt like they boiled the lobster and placed it into the pho--meh. Disappointed. BUT THE OXTAIL FRIED RICE! AHH! It was really good.

After going over the menu, everything looked good on paper. I went with the Oxtail Fried Rice and Edamame. Wifey went with the Grilled Squid. Our friends got the Fish Tacos and Bone Marrow soup.

For the appetizers the Edamame was lightly grilled and sprinkled with sea salt. Taste was just ordinary. As for the Fish Tacos they give 3 little taco shells that look and taste kind of like deep fried won tons. The actual fish (which was not much) was yellow tail.

The Oxtail Fried Rice was very salty. I think they put too much soy sauce. I could only eat about 3 spoonfuls. That's too bad because tastewise, I dont think it needed that much salt.

The Grilled Squid was on point. Nicely seasoned and grilled. The spicy garlic aioli sauce that it comes with complemented it very well.

The Bone Marrow soup comes with a huge bone. Literally. Im not into that so I cant really say if I liked it or not.

Service was great. We never had to ask for refills on our waters especially me because of the excess salt that I had eaten.

Overall, the total tab was around 70 bucks including tip. In my opinion, the food is great with the exception of the Oxtail Fried Rice. I think the pricing is bit much based on the portions you get. The Beef Carpaccio was recommended by my Yelp friends after seeing my check-in here. Im sure I will find myself in the area next time so a second visit will be pending.

My boyfriend and I have a food blog so our trip to Vegas was mainly for the food!
We enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food very much.
We ordered the lobster pho because we saw a couple of videos on Facebook about it... We knew we had to try it.

It was good and I understand why it was $50, but I wish there was a bit more pho noodle in it. Overall it was tasty and beautifully presented.

We also ordered the baos; both steamed and deep fried.. Delicious and beautifully presented as well!

We will definitely come back to District One the next time we're in Vegas!

Early in the afternoon they had run out of two popular dishes (big bone soup and lobster pho) as well as their coconut ice cream. I know certain dishes in restaurants do run out due to popular demand but in those cases I would expect the staff to at least suggest alternative dishes. They didn't even do that or show much empathy to the fact that I was disappointed that they didn't have what I wanted. This staff lacks customer service and pride for their food and restaurant. What I got was a waitress that alternated with another waiter while they clearly displayed a miscommunication of service. At the beginning these two made them selves available to take our order at different times when we had already given our order to one of them. Then they alternated breaking the news of the dishes they ran out of. In my opinion one unavailable dish is permissible , two is cause for concern, and three means they may need to fire their purchaser. They have good product but the business is amateur.

He then seated half of our party and proceeded to tell us it would be another 30 minutes for the other half of our party.

All while this was happening, the hostess was seating other parties that had come after us.  

However this is all beside the point.  We were quoted a wait time of 45 minutes and there was no communication from the manager about the extended wait time.  The manager also did not even attempt to try to accommodate for our party.

Once at 1:30am in the morning and again during regular lunch hours. Love that its unlike most Viet restaurants where you just eat and leave. Here you can linger. Both visits food was solid. 

Eats:
- lobster pho: $29.99 for a approx. 1.5lbs of fresh lobster in a bowl/platter of pho. This is a steal!
- bone marrow soup: flintstone-size bones in broth. More than one person can eat so share!
- steak and eggs: hubby gulped this down before i could taste but looked yummy
- beef carpaccio: awesome flavor and texture. Eat!
- scallop sashimi: fresh and amazing flavor served w/ crunchy scallop skin. Woah!
- pho tai rib eye: awesome broth really developed. 
- rice combo platter w/ pork chop, short ribs, and chinese sausage w/ kimchi and fried egg. Loved the kimchi variant and that my egg oozed yolk

Claypot: I was a little apprehensive that it would taste just like one thing.  But, it was done well, you can taste the components separately. Sauce wasn't over bearing to the rest of it. Although it doesn't say it on the menu, this does come with rice.

District One is known for it's lobster pho that goes for marketplace value of $50.00. We made reservations for 11:15am and realized we're coming in right when they opened so we really didn't need a reservation. The interior is very hip and modern looking with our hostess being very friendly and our waiter being informative funny and very attentive to our needs. What i liked when we ordered was that our waiter asked if we will need separate bills which is great as we don't have to bug the waiter/waitress if we can all have separate bills at the end of our meal so we divided our group into two to get 2 separate checks (to make it easier for our server). 

I ordered the specialty ox tail loco moco after seeing it on yelp. The dish was very rich and heavy; it came with plenty of ox tail and the egg was cooked perfectly sunny side up however it did not come with a meat patty like normal loco moco and may have helped with the richness of the dish. The Ox tail fried rice is what i should have ordered as it was balanced in flavor and would be good if it came with little side dishes (like korean style banchan). My friend complimented on how good the Bun Bo hue and big bone marrow soup was.

The Lobster pho is basically pho that comes with a whole lobster. I must say that this dish is all hype imo. The broth is not infused with lobster it's just regular pho nothing to special about it. The lobster itself was over cooked to a rubbery chewy meat; though it looks amazing in photos and video it is what it is; basic pho with overcooked lobster for $50.00. The Vietnamese donkey which is a beefed up version of a moscow mule was extremely refreshing  the strong ginger taste is welcoming and the drink is just well executed.

many people believe the Lobster Pho is this restaurants staple, but for me the ox tail fried rice is where it's at.",XGGaFdRRQHuLjkJgg8_0Aw,3,2,4,zf0VErfr7_dOHithj7_ijQ

I would have made this a 5 star review if it wasn't for the wait to get my food. The beau got his food very quickly but mines did not come out until 15 minutes later! Don't get me wrong, I do not mind waiting 15 minutes to get my food. I understand things have to be prepped and cooked but c'mon, you have to time things correctly. You can NOT just have one person eating while the other stares for 15 minutes. 

Other than that the food was amazing!

5 Spice Hen w/ Tomato Rice -- The spices used on the chicken was pretty good. Chicken could've been a little more moist but none the less pretty well cooked. It was also a good portion. It looked like a whole chicken (or should I say hen) was used. It was about $13, which was is a good price for the portion. 

Oxtail Fries-- This was part of their specials & not on the menu. It was fries with oxtail, gravy, chopped green onions, and an over easy egg on top. The flavors really burst in your mouth. It was very unique. Honestly, I thought it was going to be like Carne Asada Fries but it had no resemble to it at all! Very good. That was about $9! I thought it was going to be more expensive! 

Vietnamese Donkey-- This is their touch of Moscow Mules. & we all know I order that everywhere I go. This one was a lot sweeter than most moscow mules I've tasted. They used a Lycée alcohol and you can defiantly taste it. It even comes out with an actual Lycée fruit that I appreciated very much. This was $12, which I thought was on the pricer side but hey, its alcohol! 

Besides my rant in the beginning of the review.. service was pretty decent. Our waiter was very informative when asked questions about the menu.

I ordered the steak and eggs. It contained small cut pieces of steak, tossed around in some sauce, tomato rice, and a fried egg. Not your typical steak and eggs, but this tasted pretty good.

They have pho oxtail as well here too, which I recommend. Their broth is better than most in Vegas which are bland. Another famous dish they have is the lobster pho, which is great for pictures.

There wasn't a single dish that we didn't enjoy, but I highly recommend the shaken beef salad, pork belly with boiled egg, beef tacos (my favorite!! Not on the menu), steak and eggs and Ox tail pho.

If you're around the area this is definitely a place to check out. You won't be disappointed:) I know my friends and I will be returning a visit real soon",9zXHCFvZ-4M11wumpJh_JQ,9,3,5,nFLHcYA7RW7Xb-i0A7VQIQ

Vibe: 5/5
I really liked how the restaurant was laid out and designed. It felt like a very hip Asian lounge that had good food and drinks. The walls had interesting pictures and designs definitely were something to look at. I come from San Jose so I definitely liked the Vietnamese fusion vibe they got going on.
Service: 5/5
Service was wonderful, we were seated right away and the staff answered any questions that we had. One of my friends is almost deathly lactose intolerant so the waiter was very thorough and explained what everything was made of, so we really appreciated that. Well done.
Food: 5/5
I wanted to order the Lobster Pho, however, I had just eaten right before so my stomach wasn't up for it. Instead, I ordered the Ahi Fish Tacos and Mekong Boat Noodles. The Ahi Tacos were simply delightful. The ahi tuna mixed with the fusion of vietnamese herbs were perfect. A great mix of Mexican, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes. I loved it. The Mekong Boat Noodles were on point as well. Not the best I've ever had but it definitely hit the spot.

I highly recommend this place for the creativity and boldness that they are wiling to experiment with foods from different cultures.",0owXwctCXtJcBgCwix8zRQ,1,1,5,WM68kB9VOvH987UqLlDBqA

Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by a server. We only had to wait 5 minutes on a Friday night. The decor was trendy/hipster of Vietnamese-American fusion theme. Service was great. The server took orders without needing to write it down on a notepad for a table of 6, which was quite impressive when she recited the orders. Food arrived slowly one by one. The cocktail took a little long to arrive and the lobster pho was the last to arrive (that's why I took away the 1 star). Everyone finished their meal by the time lobster pho got to the table but it was definitely a surprise. The flavor profile of the broth and the amount of lobster in the bowl was amazing! We also ordered fish tacos, calamari, and king crab. All were delicious. Note: fish tacos had raw fish so it was very light and almost like a ceviche. The taco shell was lightly crunchy which made it a great appetizer. Happy to have lobster pho checked off my bucket list",pfdf_6YGf1QVdshiWkX9xA,0,0,4,eXUVUJsmdrpNG2DOaaALtQ

The menu is small but has most of the popular Vietnamese dishes. Their specialty is lobster Pho, and variations of that, which is unique and different but usually when I go for Pho, I am looking for the beefy broth and the rare steak. So I didn't end up trying this. 

I ordered the ribeye Pho which is $9.99. The Noodles were so soggy. I can not stand super soft Noodles like this in my pho! The beef was good and they gave me a good amount for my Noodles but I barely ate any of my noodles. The broth was okay, it was plain but livened up just a little with extra hoisin sauce and sriracha but still didn't have the strong beefy flavor I crave for when eating pho. 

We also ordered the spring rolls which were $7.99, I have never paid such a high amount for spring rolls before. I expected that we'd be getting more than the other restaurants that have egg rolls for half the price. It was only two spring rolls, just like everywhere else. They did use larger wraps, though, there are still cheaper places that use the larger wraps as well. The spring roll sauce was good. The veggies were super fresh and crispy. The pork was a little tough and the wrap had hardened already before it came to our table. 

Our order was taken quickly and food came out right away but after that we were forgotten about. We had to ask a different waiter for our check and a water refill that was needed long before we asked.

Been here twice already and have not been disappointed at all. The wait staff are incredibly polite and  courteous. The wife and I have had the Vietnamese Mule, which was tasty and very well done. We have tried the following:

 Chicken Pho - The Pho broth is delicious and the wife and son loved it. What my wife liked was how her clothes didn't smell like pho after eating it, like if you go to a normal Pho restaurant.  My son was all about the broth.
 Lobster Fried Rice - Outstanding. Incredibly flavorful and presentation was just delightful!
Garlic Serrano Fried Chicken -  Fried chicken with a wonderful kick to it. Just delicious!
 Oxtail Fries - Heavy but really full of flavor to comfort the palate.
Clay Pot Chicken and Rice - just outstanding! 11 year old son loved it.

Don't be fooled by the Americanized Vietnamese flair, it's actually quite good I was very surprised myself. I was expecting it to just be mediocre. The flavors are very similar to the traditional Vietnamese cuisine you would expect. 

The reason I gave it four stars is my entree the 'double down' I got it with short ribs, was very burnt and all of one side was completely black I could barely taste the meat. I would recommend sticking with the Noodles. 

However some delicious dishes I like are:

The Spicy Hue Noodle soup: a bit spicy but very delicious

The Mekong River Noodle soup: very similar to traditional Vietnamese soup

We ordered a few drinks, a sake bomb and a donkey...one of an asian variety seeing as though it came with some lychee in it. Yum!!! I love FRESH lychee!! We spent about $100 for dinner, for the 3 of us. We tried so many things and made a night of it, really. Goodness, I cannot tell you how wonderful the service was.  The probably 8 or so different servers that came to check on us were so fantastic. We never had to search for them. They anticipated some of our needs. They watched to see if my lil one needed anything, aside from a change of clothes because she wanted to swim in the big bone soup broth because it was so good. LOL. This was definitely a unique dining experience, drinking a donkey, slurping out bone marrow, and waving our hands around because the wings were so hot. It was a fun time. And again, service was impeccable! The happy hour menu is a great deal. I hope more people will come in for happy hour. I'm sure you won't leave UNhappy!

Awesome option for people who work in the industry, quality food late night can sometimes be hard to come by off the strip. Located in the same shopping center as Chada Thai (another amazing spot) on Spring Mountain and Jones.

My favorites have been the Slow Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice served with boiled egg and pickled veggies $8.95, Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio $11.95 (looks different from most carpaccios but trust me, it's amazing), and the Five Spice Roasted Cornish Hen $11.95. Everything I've tried here has been extremely flavorful and unique yet very homey feeling. I've also tried their Oxtail Fries $9.95 and they've been alright, I'd skip these here and go to Bachi Burger if you're craving Oxtail fries instead. Here, the sauce is thinner and more gravy like. Another item that I've been dying to try but have not yet, is their Lobster Pho! They serve you an entire whole lobster! Definitely have to taste this next time if I can stop ordering my Pork Belly (my favorite). They also offer Shrimp, Clams, & King Crab Legs at Market Price if that's what you're craving :)

3008440,2015-10-03,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"First meal in Vegas!  Meh.

Good Morning Vietnam - their rendition of a Bloody Mary.  This was Pinky's drink and he wasn't a fan, well I guess I wasn't too much of a fan either just because I felt like I was drinking super concentrated V8.  A good bartender will make a good Bloody Mary with a perfect balance of flavors, not too strong in alcohol, not overwhelmed in spices, and not too thick and tomatoey.  I have to say, that although I appreciated the shrimp inside the Bloody Mary, it did nothing to tone down the thick consistency of the actual drink.  While the truffle salt I guess gets A for effort to make this drink exciting, but meh.. could have done without it.  

Shigoku oysters - was excited for our oysters, but decided to just try 2 before ordering anymore since they said they served it with caviar and some ponzu type sauce.  Nice presentation, but what a waste of a good oyster.  Sorry, but the sauce that they flooded those little shells with totally killed off the natural flavor of the oyster.  I could only feel the texture of the oyster, but the taste was all sauce.  So happy we didn't order anymore.  

Scallop sashimi - they served the scallop meat cut into thin slices with the ponzu and caviar with the more heartier, crunchier parts (I think the organs?) in the center.  Like the oysters the delicate flavor of the scallop was overwhelmed by the ponzu, but the crunchy bits actually went well with the sauce.  Pinky appreciated the crunchy bits of scallop and ended up finishing the order.

Green papaya salad - I liked this dish, it wasn't overly sweet like I had thought it would be, but it actually would have been tastier with a little more sweetness.  The salad reminded me of Thai papaya salad minus the strong fermented fish sauce flavor and scent (which I love btw).  the salad was refreshing and light, but I could have used more potent and pungent flavors.  Only downside was that the dish was supposed to come with pork, but when we got it there was only shrimp.  Initially I thought that maybe I had just read the menu wrong, but then our waiter came up with another bowl of salad but with all pork in it to make up for the mistake.  It wasn't a big deal... but just kind of weird how they remedied the situation.  But oh well, it was a win for Pinky bc he packed the pork salad up and ate it as a late night snack later on.   

Lobster pho - price is marked as MP, we paid $40 for the bowl.  Noodles were cooked perfectly!  The lobster meat was sweet and the little brain/guts in the head were deliciously enjoyed by yours truly.  The broth itself was on the milder side... Honestly I had low expectations for this dish, but it actually surpassed them.  HOWEVER, I wouldn't order this dish again and $40 for it.  Maybe I'm just not a big enough fan of lobster to do it... but after my bandwagon-y instagram picture post of the dish, I'm over it.  

Service was awesome, and the menu items go well with the cool atmosphere of Vegas... Might even do well in LA where theres a bunch of hipsters, scene kids, bandwagonners, and unknowing mi trang.

The Serrano wings and garlic fries thought, not that good... No flavor and pretty plain but we got it during happy hour so at least the price was good.

Overall it was good. I'd probably only go for the pho because the broth was good and flavorful. Decently priced, especially during happy hour (5pm-7pm).",fIVNJ73Q3FxoFaf6m3KV4Q,0,0,4,o-flRhhSdhLBudQj0XPJJg

Waitress and staff were attentive thorughout the night. The restaurant decor was pleasing and soothing, it was lamost like a place you would visit if you were near the beach or coast. The music ambience was modern and enjoyable.

The food menu had a few selections which was good, as too many options at times seems to make things complicated. We ordered the Edemame for appetizers and were not too thrilled with the sauce. The Belly Buns were delicious and so were the Beef Lemongrass Skewers (love that the lemongrass stick was encompassed by the beef in order to enhance the flavor).

If I was to eat fries, it would only be the oxtail fries because that was seriously the best thing I have ever eaten... In terms of French fries. We also ordered hot tea and they give you this big tea cup with tea bags. The hot tea served is green tea and they give you pots of hot water.

According to the server , the broth was cooked 5 hours with the lobster; but when I tasted the broth, I couldn't get a taste of lobster at all! The broth was not has tasteful as I expected and lacked some flavor. My other complaint would be the noodles weren't as fresh as I expected. For a $50 bowl every bite should be exquisite - and the best is exactly what I was expecting but did not get. Given , I know we were paying for the price of the lobster - everything else still should have been amazing.

Ok I'm lying, I also enjoy the arcade games at Circus Circus and the Bellagio Fountains a great deal but recently District One Kitchen & Bar has resoundingly become one of the reasons I desire coming to Sin City more than I already do.

The Vietnamese inspired food here is simply just amazing and is only rivaled by the incredible service, ambiance and family-friendly vibe this cozy hangout offers up in droves.

But seriously, there's really something for any type of mood you're in. I mean let's be honest pho can cure all maladies, I know I eat it to stay young and virile, but the stuff can probably cure Ebola too.

I didn't even know Las Vegas had a China Town in the City of lights. This is a must, place to visit! Take a break from the strip -- sun, drunk people and gambling. 

My other half and I love to share our food. This is what we had:

-The wings- (Garlic Serrano Pepper) They were just cooked right and crispy. The sauce at the bottom of the tray was top notch! Very Juicy

-Belly Buns- (Pork Belly, Clintro & Peanut Sauce) The bun was so soft it just melted in my mouth, the peanut flavor was awesome. They didn't have so much fat on the meat! (A+ Plus) 

-The 3 pound Garlic Lobster with noodles-- WOW! WOW! This was amazing! At first we thought 3 pound was going to be a lot of food, but at the end we devoured it! The noodles were very fresh and tender. The lobster was cooked just right. The seasoning was great and finger-licking good! 

Dessert- O-mg-! The ice cream is to die for! They only have one flavor which is coconut -- served on a coconut shell.

I expected it to taste more like lobster, or at least, seafood. The chicken pho is served with dark meat, not white. Not sure if white meat is optional. The steak and egg was good. The soft shell crab is good except the ponzu sauce that was served with the soft shell crab did not taste like the traditional ponzu sauce. Their papaya salad also didn't taste like the traditional papaya salad. The spring rolls were good. The worst item we ordered was the kimchi. They totally missed the flavor.

This place is so heavily advertised that we had to make this a mandatory stop on our trip.

I was not impressed with the pho dishes at all. The Oxtail pho had decent flavor and the taste seemed to get more rich as I kept eating. The Lobster pho was bland and probably the biggest disappointment. I understand this is ""exotic"" pho but $14 and $MP, respectively, they weren't worth it. What was even more disappointing was paying so much for the pho and it didn't even include the basic meatballs, flank, tripe, tendon, etc. With these two bowls of Pho, you are very limited on meat. You're better off going to a normal Pho restaurant and paying less for more (food & broth quality).
 
Oxtail Fries were delicious. The gravy wasn't too salty nor was it too rich. It had the right amount of flavor and I would recommend it.
 
Grilled Squid was also a worthy dish. The squid had a hearty, meaty taste instead of being rubbery so you know it was grilled perfectly. The spicy aioli was a nice touch (as you know I love aioli).
 
King Crab with spicy aioli was my absolute favorite. The only thing I didn't like about  the dish was that it had me wanting more afterwards. The spicy aioli was a great compliment to the sweet chunk of king crab.
 
I would still come back here. There are many dishes that I consider unique, and I think it's definitely worth a few more visits. However, I wouldn't recommend the pho unless you're coming for the hype. And if you are, my opinion wouldn't matter anyways.",dJ8UNl_5pGiAp4IXou1owA,0,0,3,MkKRiFxuMb7aavQWxjnUaQ

First, the whole place can only be described as stellar Vietnamese food meets hip, modern, clean Brooklyn-hipster decor meets Texas BBQ-sized portions. Allow me to elaborate:

- I have gone here three times in the last week, each time with a big crowd. This means I've sampled a lot of the menu. Must eat: eggrolls with lettuce wrap, thai basil, radish; pork buns pork buns pork buns; steak Pho--I almost never get pho anywhere because I find it boring, flavorless, and not-filling. This is not the case here. This is, hands down, the best pho I've ever had; fish tacos

- This place is huge and clean, with ""chalkboard"" walls, long tables, concrete floors, and plenty of room to spread out. It's not one of those drab, dark, maroon carpeted joints that Spring Mountain has plenty of. 

- The portions are enormous. Every plate is just overflowing with goodness.

On top of all of that, the service is great. Friendly, attentive but not overbearing, and speedy. This is clearly a family-owned and run establishment and it's likely that the people telling you about the specials and serving your food have a vested interest in making sure you have an excellent time, and it shows.",TqgZ4Q9SJMpektis-O01PQ,3,3,5,jydsSiBaPXjaAN4cuEf5fQ

We were able to find this restaurant in Vegas that actually serves razor clams, and decided to visit. :) It's Asian-fusion...and serves dishes ranging from pho, to bone marrow, to pork belly, etc.

We ordered the following:
(1) bone marrow soup - huge portion, primarily consists of 2 large bones, they were huge! once you suck out all the marrow, there's not much left other than the soup to drink. you should probably order some rice or noodle to go w/ this soup, since it doesn't come with. my husband ordered this and thought it was OK, i personally wouldn't order it again.
(2) oxtail pho - i didn't have this dish, but apparently this pho is suppose to be one of their specialties, especially if you like oxtail!
(3) bun bo hue - my sister in law had this dish and thought it was good; spicy though
(4) braised pork belly w/ rice and egg - i ordered this dish because i'm a fan of pork belly and it was yummy! flavors were great, broth was yum, and i gobbled up my dish (but had 1 pork belly left over which my husband helped to finish up).
(5) 4 orders of razor clams -- 2 orders of the grilled w/ scallions, 2 orders of the black bean sauce; YES MUST GET ! it's not on their regular menu, but only available on their ""special menu, which they write on chalkboard"" -- each order only comes with 2 razor clams, so that's a bummer. each order is $8.95 too, so very expensive!
I personally liked the black bean sauce once better, because it comes out sizzling on a platter. the grilled one is not as flavorful , and less salty, but some people like that version. 
(6) belly buns -- pork belly buns (each order comes with 3 buns); these were delicious, kinda wish we got more, but if you like pork belly buns, then order this! you won't regret it :)
(7) fish tacos -- i didn't eat this so i'm not sure how it tastes, but the folks who ate them said it was delicious. the taco itself was very tiny though, so don't expect a full size taco! they are petite.

Yes, it is a must try, but again...no unless you win big at a casino and can afford it and only like a little bit of noodles.

Food: We weren't particularly too hungry this day so we ordered the Garlic Serrano Wings and Steak and Eggs. I've been to a restaurant in the past where they served a dish similar to the steak and eggs so I was pretty excited about this dish. Although all around it was good, it wasn't noteworthy. The beef was a little bit on the tough side, but the flavor made up for that. As for the rice that came alongside it, it definitely lacked some flavor. The Garlic Serrano wings were also subpar. These little wings didnt much meat clinging to the bones and the flavor was lacking as well. The flavors sounded really good on paper, but to be honest I probably won't order this again. I really wanted to try their famous Lobster Pho, but that will have to be ordered during my next visit. 

Environment/ambiance: The restaurant itself is placed in the middle of what looks like an old school Asian plaza. The decor is new and different, almost screaming that it's modern next to its neighbors. On a sunny day you can't miss it---it shines in the sun. Indoors it looks like it used to be a Boiling Crab. They do a good job of representing their seafood theme. It's cozy, a little musty, and the only thing missing is nearby seawater. There's booths along the walls and a few tables for large groups in the middle. 

Service: We came early during the lunch hour so we were seated right away. We were also attended to right away by our server, but he didn't do much talking. It would've been helpful if he explained the menu more (although I already had in mind what I wanted to order so no explanation needed).

The food is decent. Price is a bit high compared to other vietnamese pho places. But this place is more modern, so I guess the price jump is expected. 

Some of the wait staff were really friendly.

The coconut dessert seemed too pricey for what you get.

But ahhhh!!! It's so popular that sometimes, they're out of it (hence my one star deduction). Don't you fret though! They have a TON of other great dishes! If they're out of bone morrow (like tonight), then I order the oxtail pho with rice instead of noodles. If you're not feeling like soup, try the oxtail fried rice. So rich in flavor!!! Those are the top 3 we like to order, but tonight we decided to go with one of their specials: 18oz ribeye! A little on the pricy side but it was so juicy and seasoned to perfection! In all, you really can't go wrong with anything you order here. Service is great and food comes out pretty fast. Oh and if you're over 21, try the coconut mojito. It's amazing and comes inside a coconut! And if you're any age, try their coconut dessert. (Can't you tell I love coconuts lol). But really...

Not your traditional pho, you can order Lobster pho, oxtail pho, or big bone (bone marrow) pho. Naturally we had to try one of each! The lobster pho broth is very light, and you get a decent amount of lobster with your pho. My oxtail pho was delicious, complete with a nice rich broth. The big bone broth was a sight to see! They even give you a straw to suck out the marrow.

The service is really good. The staff consistently checks up on your table to make sure everything is okay, if you need anything, or any refills on your drinks. 

Things I've ordered:
Oysters- love, love, love
Serrano wings- crispy goodness
Ox tail fries- DELICIOUS everytime, perfect flavor combo
Belly buns- okay, I never ordered it again
Beef carpaccio- truffle anything n it's AMAZING
Lobster pho- okay, I did it for the gram (not worth price)
Big bone soup- I LOVE bone marrow, I get this EVERYTIME
Ox tail pho- okay, I like my Ox tail fall off the bone tender
Ox tail fried rice- really good, full of flavor

I want to say that I've ordered everything that I would like to eat from the menu, and now it's hard to choose what I want everytime I go. I try to go with more people, so I can order more and SHARE family style. Sharing is caring!!!

I think the pho is better if you're looking for more a light broth because the bbh definitely has a kick. We also ordered their fresh coconut juice and felt everything was good. It's a bit expensive for Vietnamese food (our bill came out to nearly $50) and I feel like you can get a decent bowl of pho in that area for a bit less.

3173976,2015-12-23,7,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"So I have eaten here a couple of times with the family.  Once for dinner and once for lunch.  The food is good and I do appreciate the good service we got on both visits.  On the most recent visit the wife and I had Pho Oxtail, fish tacos and Steak and Egg Rice.  The wife so enjoyed their Pho last time she quickly selected the Pho Oxtail for her lunch.  I went with the Steak and Egg Rice and we went with the fish tacos for our appetizer.  
   The fish tacos were good but got to be honest not great.  The lacked the depth of flavor I expected and were kind of bland.  The Steak dish was slightly too salty which but it was a tasty dish.  It was sweet with a little sour taste and paired well with the rice and over easy egg.  I enjoyed the dish but wish the salt was used a little more sparingly.  
   The highlight of he meal was the Pho Oxtail.  They do some very good Pho and the Oxtail is one of the better ones. The broth was so so good.  It had such a good depth to it.  It was a beef broth with the nice accent of mint in the background.   The mint didn't overpower the dish but was there to add to the delicious flavor.  The meat was plentiful and very tender and good.  The wife was so happy with her choice and she prefers District One's Pho over several other places in town.  
   I do love their ambiance and have been in later in the evening when the crowd is there to have a mixed drink or two and enjoy some great food. It is a happening place and can get very busy in the evenings and on weekends.  The staff is excellent and took good care of us on both our visits.  Funny thing the daughter had been there with a friend just the day before.  She brought home some leftovers and they were so good that we wanted to have D1 for lunch.

I came here to try the Live Lobster pho that everyone was raving about. Our server informed us before hand that it was not the season for lobster since they were less than a pound each. So they will be using frozen lobster for the pho. I had to re-evaluate if I still wanted to order this, so I asked them that will the broth be as sweet as if it was made with live lobster. Our server answered yes. So, I went on and ordered it.

IT WAS NOT WORTH IT! $49 for pho made with frozen lobster. It was tasteless and the noodles itself was soggy. I will not recommend ordering this. Also, my friend ordered the Lobster garlic noodles, which was SUPER salty. I will not be back.",KNK-JvuvvhG0CT9w6B6QTw,3,1,2,FRnHaMIsgOrcXDpMwVoUoQ

The decor of this place is simple & in my opinion if what I call cute & chic. They have a chalk wall where they have handwritten specials & social media references. They have booths along the wall & tables in the center of the resteraunt with the bar closest to the kitchen. 

We were greeted right away & seated right away. Our hostess gave us a rundown of what they were all about & lucky for us we came in for HAPPY HOUR TIME which we thought ended at 6 but was informed that it ends at 7 YAY =]

Our server came right over & helped us out on what are the best items as well as showing us the portable chalkboard of their daily special! I did wish they had the prices written down though. Multiple servers checked up on us throughout our dinner & constant refills on our waters. 

WHISKEY BARREL BREW BEER 15.00- I personally do not like whiskey but the hubby loves it & I love beer but he doesnt... then this large bottle of AWSOME came along & it was a whole new world & connection for us ahhaha. It was suttle & smooth with a caramely richness with a bit of chocolate bitterness. YOU JUST GOTTA TRY IT!!

VIETNAMESE BEEF CARPACCIO 11.95(9.95 HH) - WOW amazing sauce that it is served with & thinly thinly sliced beef that is rare & o so TENDER!!

SERRANO WINGS 6.95(0.50 each HH) - so crispy & hot (temperature wise) the wings could have definately used a little more seasoning itself but when you eat it with the serranos  it has some more flavor.

GARLIC FRIES 2.95HH - crispy fries with fresh sautéed chopped garlic giving it a full blast of flavor

BIG BONE SOUP 14.95 - O My... FLINTSTONES sized bones as it is served whole bones with some meat at the bottom of the soup bowl with broth! So much marrow comes out of the bones when you poke it out with the knife provided. You also get the tendon!

STEAK & EGGS 13.95 - like the traditional cubed peppered steak that most Vietnamese resteraunt serve but i would say a little different & maybe the least favorite of the choices that I ate but still good. Just different from what I was expecting.

SEA SNAIL SOUP - not really for my taste buds... ahhah the broth was a little too fish saucy for me

1/2 DOZEN OYSTERS 9.95(1.25 each HH) - amazingly fresh with awsome cocktail sauce 

CRISPY EGG ROLLS 6.95(3.99 HH) - taro & pork with veggie filling served with lettuce and mint leaves

OXTAIL LOCO MOCO - a little liquidy compared to most Loco Mocos I have had but maybe that is there style... regardless the flavor is tasty goodness.

OXTAIL FRIES 9.95 - full of flavor & seriously think they use some of the pho broth to make the oxtail sauce that is drenched over the crispy thin fries.

PORK BELLY BUNS 7.95(3.99 HH) - the pork literally just melts in your mouth & the white bun so soft & chewy as it should be 

COCONUT ICE CREAM - not 100% sure if they make it but the ice cream itself also has some chunks in it & it also comes in a fresh coconut shell!

PANDAN CREME BRULEE - I THINK that's wat it was called but honestly the most addicting creme brulee... rich in flavor & vibrant in color with a perfect sugar shell

Overall this is a new favorite place for Vietnamese cravings that is a GIVEN! The broth for the pho soup base also reminds me of pho back in Cali which is always comforting with blasts of flavor!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,9,6,5,TNcJ238Fyl4eKaM3qWl5Pg

Love the fried calamari, love love LOVE the oxtail fried rice!!!  it was so good that I, personally, ordered another one!  The pork belly bun was good, but not the best.  Typical spring rolls and egg rolls.  We ordered oysters on a half shell, that was a big disappointment and we all love oysters.  It did not taste...good.  not bad, but definitely not good.  We didn't even finish it.  So we all ordered individual entrees aside from the 20 dishes we had already.  I ordered the Marrow bone soup dish...thing.  I love bone marrow and I just had to have it.  While I'm chomping on the oxtail fried rice, main entree is trickling in.  Wondering where's mine and all of a sudden my friend's eyes looked like a pug.  Just sticking out like it's reaching for something.  I turned around and I saw this monolithic prehistoric bone sticking out of a bowl.  ""Marrow Bone Soup"" they called out.  Whoa, it's my dish.  I think I had a T-rex bone marrow.  Two giant bone sticking out of my bowl.  I didn't even know how to tackle it, but hey, I love food and I'm not ashamed of it.  I ate it like a true rockstar, my hands and a straw.  Absolutely devine!  I was so happy and enjoying my ""bone"", hahahaha.  Friends took pictures of me left and right.

They get you to come in by offering things you would not normally see in a typical Vietnamese restaurant. Most notably is the lobster pho, where they put an entire cooked lobster in your noodles. While the idea is clever and unique, the price is a little steep for me. While I do love lobster and pho, I wouldn't pay $50 per bowl for it, especially when I can get a good bowl of pho for under $6 back home. Some of the more affordable dishes are the big bone soup, which has tons of delicious cartilage that just falls off the bone and juicy marrow. There's no noodles in it, just soup, but it's good nonetheless. Ox tail fried rice isn't something you see all the time, but they certainly make it good here.

Their menu is absolutely solid, and I've been having fun working my way through the list.

I have been sleeping on District One and so happy I am awoken now. After dying in Vegas and not getting out of bed until 5PM my friends and I decided to revive our lives with some pho, the ultimate hangover cure... 

My friends were saying they went before and had to wait 45 minutes so I was a little hesitate to give this place a shot. However, when we went inside there was no wait. BLESS UP. 

The broth flavor is indescribable. But what really makes their bowls of pho so great is the meat to noodle ratio. They be stackin' & packin' their meats!!!

3333509,2016-06-14,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"This review is for 3.5 stars.

District One is one of those places where it's hit or miss depending on the wait staff, time of day, and luck.  The restaurant itself is very hip when you walk in and doesn't give off that usual Asian sit-down vibe like the other restaurants in the area.  District One has a feeling of hanging out, and should be a go-to Happy Hour spot for some of the food.  Drinks aren't cheap though, so keep that in mind.

I had the meatball pho, pork buns, and chicken wings.  Meatball pho was just ok.  I know I should have gone for one of their flagship oxtail or bone marrow phos, but I messed up - shame on me.  The chicken wings had a nice kick but were all in all ordinary Asian wings.  The pork buns were amazing.  The bun, the meat, the filling, all top notch.  Come during Happy Hour for a great deal and get a few orders of them.

The complaints are long; if it wasn't for the solid food and the ultimate finale of our situation, I would have given 2 stars for sure.  First off, after being immediately seated in an almost empty restaurant at about 5pm, the waiter took 10 minutes just to take our order.  He brought over a different beer than what we asked for and then when we placed our order, it took 40 minutes to come out, all at the same time, not staggered as appetizers and mains should be.  Apparently the kitchen gave our order to another table which just blows my mind because no way somebody ordered our exact dishes.  But the worst part was that no waiter came by to check up on us during this 40 minutes without food, even with empty beer up to that point.  We ultimately just packed our appetizers in to-go boxes straight away and only ate the pho at the restaurant because we were in a hurry.  The waitress comped both appetizers, which is nice, but still doesn't make up for the previous 45 minute meal experience.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,UNqSWiDkjDQk-tFCH9ZHXQ

The bone marrow soup is picture worthy only because it is something you don't see everyday.  Two gigantic bones on a shallow bowl.  It was kind of difficult to eat because the bowl was so shallow, but the flavor was great.  Bone marrow tastes like butter to me.  The broth is beef/pho.  

The oxtail fries were okay.  I'm used to Bachi Burger's oxtail chilli cheese fries.  Here, it's just oxtail marinated in sauce minus the chilli.  Includes an over easy egg.

-parking: a big parking lot for this plaza. 
-service: we came in and the lady sat in the counter told me if I was ok to seat by the bar, we can go for it. I asked her there were not two seats together, I didn't want to have my brunch with different seats with my hubby. She said she could grab a chair which she never did, she didn't even remember she told me what she would do for us. Maybe she's over busy, but it didn't seem very busy that she could handle with the crowds. As soon as we settled ourselves, we had to wave to ask for service, that time was not much people ordered drinks either. 
-ox tail fried rice: it tasted like they pre made in the kitchen, as soon as we placed the order, they brought to us in 5 minutes. It's a heavy dish, ox tail meats was stuck together, not evenly. We definitely felt heavy after this plate. 
-ox tail soup that is what they are famous for. We have to wait about 30 minutes for them to bring it over, we didn't have any updates with our order. Nothing special for this bowl of soup. The ox tail was hard to chew on, the meat was still stick on the bone. The noodles was very hard, it's tasted like lack of time to cook. The soup base was a bit sour. Flavorless !

So we took to Yelp and saw that this place was pretty well rated, and decided to give it a shot. After eating here, I'm sort of depressed. This was basically the best rare steak pho I've ever had, being on par with OB Noodle House in Ocean Beach, CA (which I think is the best). Pho is one of my favorite foods, and it really is a sad twist of fate that a bowl of pho this good is so far away from my hometown in Orange County. 

For starters, the broth was absolutely delicious. There was a hint of anise that was just enough to recognize, but it was downplayed by the clove, which was the star in my book. The broth had a nice complexity to it, but at the same time, it was that simple, wholesome broth that you expect from a good bowl of pho. 

The meat - wow. A good cut of ribeye that also happened to have a fair amount of marbling (I always get the meat on the side) for this type of food. It was perfect.

The interior was very modern and somewhat americanized so I honestly had my doubt about authenticity at first. There was no wait for 3 people since we sat by the bar. Our bartender/ server was very friendly. She recommended me to get oxtail pho so I did.

To decorate on the service, my friend had a surprised feminine call of nature and the server rushed to get her some emergency feminine hygiene products very discreetly! ( Mind you, we were sitting at the bar next to a few guys!) 

The oxtail pho had very flavorful clear broth as it should be. The noodles weren't impressive; however, the meat was so tender it fell off apart from the bone itself. I was so in love with every spoonful.

My friend got lobster pho. She was so hyped about it since she saw the video online and that was merely the reason why we went in the first place. Sadly, it didn't live up to her expectations and it was just average.

We had a very good experience nonetheless!",wiEVodEBxEie3vef_TirnA,0,0,4,8a62T8RMseLRMsAV0nfVEw
3439953,2014-10-01,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"The good: 
I've been here four times and I have to say that their appetizers are really good...like really really good. The oysters are to die for. Seriously. They are so sweet and taste so clean and refreshing.  The beef carpaccio is really unique and our table had to re-order it twice in one sitting because it was that good. The wings were also a hit. 

The mediocre:
All of the entrees I've tried were just okay.  I've had the Mekong river noodles, lobster pho, shaking beef, bone marrow soup, and short rib with rice and none of them were really that good.  The lobster pho did not taste better than any other pho (actually less flavorful).  For some reason everything was very bland compared to the appetizers. 

The bad:
The Porkchop with rice was extremely dry. Three people at our table ordered it and had to force it down. 

Overall, the appetizers overshadow the main courses, hands down. It's like they build you up for something really amazing and then kinda let you down. Regardless, I will keep coming back for the oysters.",eouqB0fkgp02_7mO-onKVg,0,0,3,W62FmCN-IzSuWE7h5GrBXw

When  he came back he said there was no cream so I said forget the coffee bring me my soup.

The other bone had a little  so I was ok until someone  ask me how the food was I told her about the situation  and she totally agreed  with me, she went to the kitchen  to talk to the chef and the answer was  it depends on the cut of the bone.

The broth was delicious and complimentary to the vegetables and proteins. We also ordered the garlic noodles, spicy pork green beans and ox tail fries.

My friend suggested we come here for dinner since he was in the mood for Asian food. District One is trendy Vietnamese fusion restaurant. I had trouble finding parking (Saturday night), so had to park across the street.

Service was good, and people checked on us regularly and refilled our waters. The menu wasn't huge, and I decided to pick one of their specialty dishes, lobster pho.

The pho comes with a whole lobster, and a decent amount of meat. While the dish was tasty overall, I was actually expecting the broth to be richer, considering that it was cooked with an entire lobster. 

The menu did say market price, and I knew lobster wouldn't be cheap, but the bowl of lobster pho ended up costing $49, and after tax and tip, I spent $61 on my meal. Not really worth it in my opinion. I could have bought an entire fresh lobster and made my own pho for under $30. 

Not super impressed by my first visit, but I'm sure other dishes are more reasonably priced, and there were many seemingly appealing dishes on the menu.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,1,0,4,LxPEApCda9301PzcB9eXzA

District One is that cool, hip and casual neighborhood restaurant that I wish I had in my own neighborhood. Its menu offers delectable dishes inspired by cuisine from various Asian countries.  

First course - Spring Rolls: Fresh and light and with a delicious crunch. The two rolls were packed with vermicelli, lettuce, shrimp, and pork, which was omitted for me upon my request. The peanut sauce perfectly complemented the appetizer and had balanced flavors of both sweet and salty. I feel like oftentimes I receive a peanut sauce that's just sweet. 

Second Course - Pho Tom: Despite the hotter than hell weather outside, I have no regrets about ordering this soup. This was full of shrimp and long vermicelli noodles that swam in a light and flavorful broth. 

Third Course - Pandan Creme Brulee: I love me some dessert after a meal, and this was it. Flavors were subtle and not overly sweet, which was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. 

Overall: I'm hoping this will become one of my favorite restaurants to dine at in town. I cannot wait to return.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,1,1,4,O6dBrzTp9E6sRQ5OiQfSnw

Review based on the pho. I guess I'm just used to golden deli in Cali but yeah the pho was a little off to me. Also, the spring rolls was a little different to me just cuhs the flavor was an acquired taste. The only way I can describe it is ""sweet & minty."" I like the little crunch tho. 

On the plus side, the service was great! I don't know if we had a specific server but there was a couple girls going around. Myra was super attentive! She kept making rounds for anything we needed.

Food that we felt were extraordinary:
Pho'getti, Steak & Eggs (shaken beef and tomato rice, omg, I never knew it could be so good), their special raw oysters of the day, Garlic Noodles.

Food that my guests felt was extraordinary, but I didn't really feel that way:
Live Whole Maine Lobster Pho, Oxtail Fried Rice.

Food that we always order because it goes great with beer and because we trust the food and taste quality here:
Garlic Fries, Chicken Wings, Grilled Whole Squid, Fish Tacos.

Other food we tried that were delicious and beyond average, but not something I necessary go back for:
All their pho is really good, Fried Calamari.

Their prices are on the pricier side, but it is worth it once in a while.  My only complaint is that no matter how many times I ask, they just don't carry ranch.  I get it, you know.  Vietnamese restaurants don't normally carry ranch condiments, and they probably are a little anal about the way their food should taste and don't want people to ruin it with ranch.  And maybe that's what makes this place so stable and reliable in their food.  I always know what to expect.  But c'mon...  You have fries and chicken wings, why not ranch?  Sometimes all I want is bar food, and that's why I want that ranch.  Well, one time, I brought my own ranch and they were okay with it.  Lol!

Maybe because this establishment was rated so high and all the hype about the Lobster Pho...but anywho, here it is.

We ordered:
Lobster Pho (MP - today was $30): Sure there is a lobster presented in this bowl, but seriously, it's just the typical beef broth, and a broken down lobster where the meat is pretty tough to chew.  It probably would have been better if the broth itself is made of a seafood broth?  Pretty disappointed. 

Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice ($9): Few pieces of cubed pork belly, one egg (halved), served with a bowl of rice, and a bowl of pickled cabbage and carrots.  Earl enjoyed the pickled cabbage.  This was an ok dish.  Nothing that will warrant us to order it again.

House Special Oysters ($10): We ordered the smaller portion (consisted of 6 oysters).  They were topped with soy sauce, tobiko, slice of jalepeno and something else.  The oysters were small and not sweet.  

Sculpin ($8): Earl was pretty excited that they have Sculpin here.
Overall, food was mediocre at best, based on the items we ate.  Taste does not justify the cost.

The ambience, however, was great.  There was a bar, and many tvs to watch sports, news, and whatever else.

Service is thorough and attentive here. I've never had an issue throughout my half a dozen or so visits.

They have an impressive list of beers and whiskeys as well as other spirits, for an Asian restaurant. 

Some of my favorite items to grab here are the short rib rice, the pho and any of their happy hour specials.

A bunch of us stopped in as a plan B after we sadly found out that I-naba was closed for the evening. Restaurants these days have the wierdest names!?!? I kept calling this restaurant One Direction!? After finding out the correct name, it still reminded me of The Hunger Games, not a restaurant!?!?  Oh well....

We shared a few apps and started out with the Tamarind Wings and the Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings which were both puny in portion and very underwhelming.
We also shared the Beef Carpaccio which was delicious and the star of the appetizers.

For my entree, I ordered the District One Combo Plate with The Kalbi short ribs. I asked to substitute Vietnamese Red Rice with extra garlic. This plate was good, but not great. Nice taste and char on the short ribs, but unfortunately, the rice was red, but kinda bland and there was no extra garlic like I asked for. there also was pieces of Chinese sausage and a little pile of kimchi on the plate as well but seemed like it didn't really flow with the rest of the components. 

After getting a taste of Amelinda's Slow Braised Pork Belly in Coconut Water (SO FRICKIN' ONO!!!!!) That would be THE dish I would return for. If you have the chance, order this dish. Don't ask questions, JUST DO IT!!!  ALOHA!!!!

3607934,2017-11-13,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"We wanted to be adventurous one night so we decided to try District One. Once we were there, I remembered that I had been there once when I first moved here, but I couldn't remember anything besides the interesting drink menu.

The decor inside is kind of a mix between a casual restaurant and a sports bar. They have a lot of interesting-sounding dishes, but unfortunately, a lot of them do not live up to their interesting descriptions.

The garlic chicken wings were probably the last thing we ordered that came out, and I was excited for them the whole time we waited. By the time they came, they were pretty disappointing. Very dry and no flavor on the outside. When I asked for any sort of sauce they thought could go with it, they brought me a chipotle mayonnaise, which was really unappetizing and does not go with chicken wings.

We got the short rib, which was alright, but extremely salty, to the point that I couldn't eat more than a few bites.

We also ordered a papaya salad, as my boyfriend love love loves those, and he said it was the worst he's had :/ After having a few papaya salads since then I would have to agree. It was just not made the same way they usually are - very little flavor and no crunch to the salad.

On a high note, the garlic noodles were very good as was the steak tartare, which I believe was titled a vietnamese take on the dish and I found it to be uniquely tasty.

The dessert was the best part of the meal. Coconut ice cream inside half a coconut - very delicious, crisp and not overwhelmingly sweet.",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,1,1,3,U7Xl_DX_WduMmpP1gC1ifg

Appetizers ehhh... haven't been blown away by the calamri grilled nor fried. Chicken wings LOOKED better than they tasted.
Drinks... yes! I love their drink menu. The drinks here are the unsung heroes! I've tried the coconut mojito which comes in a fresh coconut, big deal to me...if you like fresh coconut get it! The good morning aVietnam was amazing as well.

3617641,2014-11-18,6,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"In the Hunger Games series District One is supposed to be the holy land riches and beauty. Er... maybe a better comparison would be the first class flight or flying coach, you'll both be getting the same destinations, just certain amenities of first class makes the experience all the better. The cushier seat, the dim lighting, more leg space, and more flight attendant service. District One should probably take a cue from Jet Blue. 

The service here unfortunately gets worse and worse each visit. The first few visits started with longer wait times for food and progressively gotten to one of the worse service experiences I've had in a long time. No one was necessarily ""rude"" but the lack of sense or urgency really killed the experience. Maybe I should of seen it coming when it it took a day and a half to have our waiter take our order, which is usually not a big deal, you're busy I get it. 

We told the server our orders and less than 2 minutes after we tried to cancel the fish tacos (because even with the happy hour pricing the cost/value was in the negatives).  When we asked the response was ""I just put in your order"". I know, you came to our table right after you placed it, but you're telling me that you can't change the order now because somehow in the past 2 minutes the fish was being cut fresh from the Pacific Ocean and the taco shell was being made fresh (obviously this is an exaggeration because the fish tacos took over 20 minutes to get to our tables, which many would presume is ample time to tell the kitchen to cancel the item). 

What confuses me the most is that our orders were repeated to us by the server, yet 1 order of pho tai nam and an order of steak and eggs were missing? Maybe the kitchen is having a delay, no problem, but ten minutes later we followed up with it and the steak and eggs came out within minutes, perfect (except for the fact the rice should of been in a cereal box considering how crunchy it was) and then another 10 minutes later (a total of 40 mins waiting for our food) for a pho tai nam (came out minutes later as well). 

The check was another hassle of its own, and in short, the party of 4 split the check 2 ways (which we wrote in pen) and it was still messed up. It took two reprints to fix things. Water refills? Wishful thinking.

So Kevin T, you obviously had terrible service, why the 2 stars? Fortunately and unfortunately D1 has the best pho (noodles cooked inconsistently though) and food for the majority ranges from acceptable to great. Sometimes theres lots of love in the food and sometimes... none.

Mekong River Noodle Soup
Beef Carpaccio 
Wings
Beef (from their fairly crafty craft beer list)

- Shrimp and pork spring rolls, one of my favorites because I love the dipping sauce that comes with it. Only down side is that it only comes with 2 spring rolls cut into 4 pieces for $6. Pretty steep in my opinion, but I always order it anyways. 
- Pork belly buns: meh, they were okay. I've had better elsewhere. 
- Pho dac biet: my bf always orders this, he seems to like it. No complaints. 
- Ox tail pho: yum! My favorite because the meat literally falls off the bone! They give you a good amount of ox tail as well. The broth is super flavorful. I crave this and I wish we had a good ox tail pho place back in LA.

OXTAIL PHO (5/5) - with a price tag of $15.99, it's definitely the most expensive bowl of pho i've ever had, but am I crazy to say it was WORTH IT? I was a lil reluctant because some reviews here claimed the oxtail meat wasn't tender but mine was FALL OFF THE BONE, easy-peasy-to-eat tender. Abundance of meat! Flavorful broth! No complaints here.

OXTAIL FRIED RICE (5/5) - $15.99 - sampled a bite of my friend's order and it was YUMMMMMY. Very soft chunks of oxtail meat hugged by perfectly fried rice. Hefty portion size! No complaints here either.

THE BIG BONE SOUP - $17.99 - this is THE thing to order if you want something for the 'gram. The bones are RIDICULOUSLY gigantic. Keep in mind it does not include pho noodles, so if you order that on the side, it's an additional $5. Had a taste of my friend's order and it was indeed tasty and would please any bone marrow fan, but it's a dish to avoid if you want something that'd require minimal effort to eat.

VIET-CHELADA (5/5) - $8 - mmmmm tried a sip and it was delicious. Basically it's a Michelada with Vietnamese beer. Whatever they used to rim the glass was nommynommy savory and worth lickin' yo lips for.

VIETNAMESE COFFEE - just as a heads-up, they serve traditional Vietnamese drip coffee. If youza noob, wait for all the water to drip from the filter, then stir the coffee with the condensed milk at the bottom until it's all dissolved, and then pour into your cup of ice. 

! BONUS POINTS !
- the music played during my visit was A1 (mura masa and odesza vibes).
- extremely extensive drinks menu, it's crazy. If I was a Vegas local, I'd see myself coming here often to hang out and slurp/munch the night away.
- water refills by our server were oooooooooon point.

The oxtail fried rice (also $16) was too greasy and contained shreds of meat so small, I wouldn't be able to tell it was oxtail unless you told me.

Sadly, they were out of coconut shells for their coconut ice cream that day, which was odd considering we were there on a Monday afternoon. Disappointed by the food and general lack of empathy from the staff, we decided to save our money and get dessert elsewhere.

We ordered:
* Coconut Juice - came in a real coconut (I originally thought it was going to be like those viet restaurants that come in a cup and some coconut pieces) but this came in a legit coconut and you can carve the inside for yummy coconut
* Matcha Thai Tea - I was tempted to get this, so I was asking the waitress questions about it and she offered to give us samples which was very nice of her. The taste of this was a little too sugary for me, very sweet combination. I passed on this. 
* Belly Buns - they ask if you want it steamed or fried, we got steamed! This was very tasty and had a big pieces of pork belly
* Bok Choy - we got two different kinds. One with garlic only and the other with spicy garlic. Both were really good. A tad oily, but the spicy one had a really nice spicy kick to it.
* Oxtail Fries - it reminds me of poutine fries - it had oxtail meat pieces with the gravy all on top of the fries and we had egg on top. This was sooo good and creamy.
* Oxtail Pho - If you love oxtail soup, you should try this. It's pretty self explanatory for the oxtail pho. The broth tasted like oxtail (not heavy/strong) - it was light and tasted delicious. 
* Lobster Pho - expensive, but worth to try it if you love lobster. This was my friends bowl so I only tried the broth ~ the broth had the lobster kick to it. It was soooo good. Good hangover soup for sure.

In the end, they were nice enough to give our bride a complimentary congrats coconut ice cream in the end (we were all dressed up in our bride squad tanks). THAT WAS SO GOOD.

Must have appetizer is the the grilled squid, Julie knows to bring extra sauce cause my wife is always asking for more. For me, the Big Bone Marrow Pho is a must. The atmosphere and music is easy going to have a nice family dinner. Not your typical Pho restaurant where the pho comes out within 1 minute once ordered, but still in a timely manner.

Came here to have lunch on my birthday with fam bam. This place was recommended by a friend of mine but since it was cold and rainy out.. decided to have something warm for lunch.

Oxtail soup - Im a biggggg fan now. Ever since I had their oxtail soup.. I've actually started making it at home because of this. I love how there is soooo much flavor packed into the broth. Its $15 for a bowl and you get 3 big pieces of oxtail (which is a lot more then most places who serve oxtail). Very filling and worth coming back.

Shaken Beef Salad - my mother-in-law ordered this dish because she wanted something light. But the portion was pretty big for one person. Again.. the meat was packed with flavor and balances out with the salad. 

Coconut pork belly - my husband ordered this plate and I tried a piece of it. It came with CHUNKS of pork belly which is always a plus!!! Very sizeable portion & delicious.

Since it was my birthday the restaurant gave me a complimentary coconut ice cream served in a coconut. Light but sooo goooooddd. I especially liked that it was served in a coconut so you can shave a little bit of coconut into your ice cream. Not overly sweet but super creamy. Wish I could bring a gallon of this ice cream back home",aA-kQeG86xMsxjKgF14pcQ,4,5,5,BIrRyjy4EFU75HeU1EQfSg

It was tasty but the snails were awfully gritty.

The whole squid.
I prefer my squid to be tender, my friend likes the chewiness... District One's rendition was on the very chewy side. I could have gotten over that, but it was also brought out cold. Chewy cold squid is definitely not appetizing. I finished all the little burnt tenticles which the flavor was on point, but definitely a miss. 

Oxtail Pho.
Thank you for the delicious oxtail pho. This was just how we liked and hoped it would be! They have all the traditional pho toppings and tools on each table, including your own roll of paper towels.

Service was also a bit slow. We will probably continue eating at District One due to their late hours & convenience, but wish they would step their game up a bit.",moPeVo2BVmpUC9HqTiR5_A,0,0,3,TJp3gKGFpdGis6lbqn1o2Q

We tried the Oxtail Pho, Steak and Eggs, and Braised Pork Belly. I love oxtail with a passion so you really can't go wrong with me when oxtail is on the menu. It fell off the bones and they were gracious with the amount of meat they had in the pho. They put a little spin on the steak and eggs and added tomato rice which I also love (reminds me of the Asian cafe style food that you find in California if you know what I mean).  Steak was already cut up into small pieces and had an Asian flare to it.  The pork belly was pretty typical but also good. 

I definitely want to go back to try some other things on the menu. Also found out the owner is a friend of a friend so I definitely want them to do well. My only complaint was my tiny coconut hole.

What I ate:
- HH oysters: Honestly, not the best oysters in the world, but pretty decent for HH price. 
- HH Garlic Fries: skinny fries. For some reason these came out kind of late. I was hoping to have them with the oysters. After some time they got soggy. I would pass on these fries unless this is all you plan on getting
- Oxtail Fried Rice: My friend who had been to District One before highly recommended this, and I'm so glad we ordered it. The oxtail was super tender and delicious, a great addition classic fried rice. Over easy fried egg on top just pushed it to the next level of decadence. Please order this to share with the table! 
- Beef Pho: This was good. I'm not a huge fan of pho, so I can't really tell you much
- Wonton Noodle Soup: This was a good wonton noodle soup. Shrimp wontons were tasty. This would be great to warm up with if you're craving noodle soup

Pros:
- Not much of a wait on a Friday night. 
- Happy hour until 7pm! 
- Friendly staff
- That oxtail fried rice! seriously, so good

Cons:
- Very cold. I think we were sitting under a vent, but it was freezing cold. I get it, it's the desert, but it made my friends and I crave warm noodle soup, which is why I think we ended up ordering noodle soups
- Asian parking lot. You know how it goes - spots are tight, horrible Asian drivers, very very busy and full parking lot.

This dish was seasoned well and cook to the way fried rice should be, not being too dry and bland. It was balanced and consistent especially with the easy over egg on top. 

A few things when going to District One:

-Not a traditional Vietnamese Restaurant but Asian American Fusion style in a modern setting with a Vietnamese twist.

-Menu is only a page long on a clip board but they have an extensive drink menu which was like a small booklet.

- Great place to hangout with a group of friends or family members with open floor plan and large size tables.

The broth was sweet from the brine and it didn't need any hoisin or Siracha sauce. 1.5lb worth of lobster and it's all shelled for you to enjoy.,rUzVpgwXZ0LlmGVE8Rw_hQ,0,0,5,-Ke5OlnOYsJa7h4__BuR2w

3869991,2015-08-18,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"My first attempt at District One Kitchen and Bar came after a somewhat drunken night when someone in our party became sick. So entirely that experience could not do the place justice. After the rave reviews I heard from this multi-Asian fused gem, I had to go back a few nights later to find out for myself. I'm sorry to say that I was totally disappointed. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very dark, even early in the evening. Dark enough that some patrons needed their phone flashlights to see the menu. The overall feel is very hip, with age ranges between the late teens to early 30's, with decent but loud music playing in the background. There are a good number of raised booths surrounding the middle table areas. Parking can be difficult outside with a smaller sized lot and a good number of restaurants side by side. Table service is very slow, with the water always running empty.

Now to the food. The heavily raved oxtail fried rice was nothing spectacular. Rather, I caught myself grabbing whatever water was left and fried rice from another plate to combat how oily it was. I really wanted it to be good, but the flavor was uneventful. Our party had a couple variations of Pho, one more disappointing than the next. The rib eye steak was decent, but it cannot explain why the lobster pho was an absolute failure. The $40 pho was bland, with the lobster meat being tough and overcooked. Although it was visually pleasing, it was not good value at all. The best dish was their rice combo platter with short rib, pork chops, and Chinese sausage. Portions notwithstanding, a pretty solid dish overall with a good mix of robust spices and flavors. Do yourself a favor, keep the fried rice and skip the garlic noodles. We did not order anything from the bar.

This unfulfilling experience will keep me from venturing into District One Kitchen and Bar again.",h5OjJINwtny1cJnNFWnq7A,1,0,3,5z_RvFKB9bNh6YL64ABrqQ

3875642,2015-01-06,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"I have been here twice now and and it's because this place had a lot of buzz over the summer. Even though I am really curious as to how the oxtail pho is I have yet to try it. Since this is an Asian fusion place, both of the times I brought visitors here from out of town and the food did not disappoint. For the most part they execute their dishes pretty well. Often times Asian fusion restaurants tend to over due it as in ""trying to hard,"" but that is not the case here because their fusion is just a slight twist on the original dishes. The first time I was not too hungry and I ate the tacos which were phenomenal. The light crispness of the wonton and then the freshness of the yellow tail make it a match made in heaven. Although delicious they are super small and kind of pricey for what you pay for. However, I guess the fresh fish constitutes it. On both of my visits we ordered the tacos and they did not disappoint any members of my party. The second time I had the combo platter with the beef short ribs and I do love me some short ribs. I am usually not a fan of Chinese sausage, but surprisingly I ate what was served on my plate because the flavor wasn't too overwhelming like it usually is. I must say I originally ordered the pork chop but then it was served with short ribs. Our server who took my order even saw the short ribs on my plate and immediately told his co-server that it's supposed to be pork chop. I was hungry and did not want to wait so I didn't mind the short ribs at all. My 2 other friends who were with me also ordered the combo platter but with both meats. I tried the pork chop from their plate and thought it was good. This place is pretty popular considering both times I've come here I've bumped into people I know. My friend ordered a coconut martini and it was served in a coconut, pretty awesome I must say. That's probably Asian fusion at it's finest. I've also been told by 2 friends that the coconut ice cream is to die for. So I must try that the next time I'm here. In regards to service, service is pretty good. On my first visit our server was Adrienne and she was pretty spectacular. The other members of our party could not decide to order so she basically gave a description of everything on the menu. She even gave my friend suggestions on what to order based off of what he craving. She was really patient and pleasant during our entire dining experience.

3877257,2015-08-20,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"My parents were in town and I really wanted to take them to Raku. But, unfortunately, their earliest reservation was 10:30 pm, so District One became plan B. Serendipitously, we were just in time to catch the tail end of happy hour. The happy hour menu features some great appetizers at 30-40% off. We started off with the fish tacos, beef carpaccio, belly buns, spring rolls, a half dozen fresh oysters, and the garlic fries to start. Of those, I really enjoyed the fish tacos and beef carpaccio. The fish tacos featured yellowtail sashimi and a lot of acid (serrano pepper, cherry tomato) wrapped in a crispy taco shell. It was an interesting take on a not so taco Tuesday fish taco. The Vietnamese beef carpaccio was the most flavorful dish of the bunch. The thinly-sliced beef was just ever-so-slightly seared and mixed with lime juice, peanuts, and onions for the most flavorful carpaccio I've had. The belly buns were their featured braised pork belly. The pork belly was very tender and the buns were perfect (I've had a lot of shitty buns), but I didn't get too much flavor. The spring rolls and garlic fries were standard fillers. The fresh oysters were huge (not the typical small, sweet ones you find) and worth a try. 

As for the entrees, we were quite full from the happy hour appetizers, so we decided to split two dishes. We had to get the popular oxtail fried rice. This dish is as amazing as everyone says. The fried rice is nicely seasoned and the ox tail meat is flavored well although some portions are more fibrous than expected. No fried rice is complete without a sunny side up egg to top it off. The other dish we tried was the crispy bird nest noodle. I liked most of the food up until this point, but this noodle dish was just plain awful. It was so salty and the combination of stir-fried beef, fish balls, and shrimp made no sense. The flavors of sweet, savory, and mostly just salt made it unpalatable. The noodles were also completely fried instead of having the outside crispy and the inside soft as it traditionally is. This disaster dish aside, I liked the overall menu and atmosphere. Happy hour beers are $3-4 so check out happy hour 5:00 to 7:00 pm or reverse happy hour 12:00 to 3:00 am.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,2,4,OlEdJqxYidsjR9xHjcrmlw

Free parking lot for the plaza. We didn't have any trouble but we were there right when they opened for lunch.

Service was decent. They were friendly and checked up on us. They forgot 2 requests, but fixed it right away when we asked again. 

For the food, my group ordered family style. I got to try some of their pork belly buns (fried and steamed), garlic noodles, and surf and turf pho, and I decided not to touch the other dishes. 

We got 2 versions of the pork belly buns, but the star of the dishes was seriously lacking. It was mostly gelatinous fat instead of a nice balance. The surf and turf pho definitely had big pieces of lobster in it. It didn't make me feel like I was getting ripped off by the cost. I wasn't feeling the broth though.

I heard that this is one of the best pho places from multiple Vietnamese folks. I personally can't tell the difference, but they offer a variety of pho, and everything was delicious. The oxtail fried rice is a must as is the mikong pho. The ingredients are fresh and broth tasted clean, which are always pluses for me! We like to eat our pho with sliced onions as a side dish covered in chili sauce, and they came out with sliced red onions which was yummy and not usual at pho joints in LA.

We didn't get the infamous lobster pho (market price was $45 when we went which is quite steep for pho...) but I heard it's overrated and not worth the big bucks. They also had a Instagram special where if you post a photo on Instagram, they take $5 off the plate. Even that incentive was not enough for us to take part.

I'd recommend stopping by for a lunch meal, but I don't think it's worth any sort of wait. It's a fun atmosphere though!

The lobster was cooked perfect and paired well with their broth. I really enjoyed it and would come back for it again, even if it's pricey ($50).

We also ordered the sea snails with a Tom Yum soup base. It was extremely delicious! I would definitely recommend this dish. 

I want to give this establishment 5 stars but there was a lot of miscommunication involved that forces me to give it 4 stars. We had to come here three times in the span of 2 days in order to finally be able to try the lobster pho before heading back to LA. The first night we came here on a Saturday night at 9 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. Even though there seemed to be a lot of seating, the hostess was really slow at seating guests. Finally, it was our turn to be seated and we overhead that they had run out of lobster for the day, so the lobster pho was unavailable. The hostess suggested we call back tomorrow morning to see if they would have a shipment the next day. So we took her advice and called to question if they would another shipment. When we called at 11 am on a Sunday, the  person on the phone assured us that they had lobster. So we made the drive off the strip expecting to try the lobster pho, and the waiter tells us the shipment didn't come yet. It was really inconvenient that the person on the phone gave us false information and had us drive all the way to the restaurant. Finally, towards the end of our day, we decided to call and ask again. They assured us they really had a shipment of lobster. Because it was delicious and worth the wait, I got over the fact that we had to make three attempts. I have the impression that they must run out of things quite often because I wanted to order a fresh coconut drink and they explained that they ran out of that too.

I guess I am definitely in the minority here, but I thought the best thing about my visit was serendipitously meeting Eric and Lisa R and having them join us for dinner. Beyond that this place had mediocre food and terrible service. From the moment I walked through the door, it was nothing but waiting.

Waiting for a host/-ess or anyone to acknowledge us or tell us to put our name down, etc. After being seated and ordering, it was waiting for my ice tea which came after everyone else's drinks were served and only after prompting the waitress. Then waiting for everyone's entree. I ordered the bun bo hue and green papaya salad, which came out in that order.

The green papaya salad had large, steamed 20/25 shrimp, instead of the dehydrated small bay shrimp (which add additional saltiness to the dish). It was okay. The bun bo hue had a good, robust beef flavor and was not too spicy, but it was missing the pig hock and the pig's blood. When I asked if they forgot, the waitress replied they were out. Gee, you couldn't tell us that before we ordered?! You can't send someone across the street to 168 Market to  buy some? To add insult to injury, while waiting our waitress to refill my ice tea, I see a waiter carrying a pitcher of ice tea by, look at my empty glass, walk to his table to fill a glass of ice tea, and then walk away to set the pitcher down. Really dude?! I know we were not your table but I guess you would've died on the spot if you had filled, or even inquired about, another customer's ice tea.

We had a party of 10. We thought appetizers took a few minutes too long to come out. The oysters on the specials of the day menu were 3.50 each and they were very small. I thought they were good, but I would rather not have the caviar texture on it. The thinly sliced meat with oil was interesting. It was good, but food at room temperature doesn't really appeal to me. Most of the family got the oxtail soup since the bone marrow pho was sold out. They thought it was good, the noodles are thicker than we are used to. 

The most negative part of our experience was that our food came out at very different times. Half of the party who ordered rice dishes ended up finishing eating as the soups made their way out. We came here to eat together not watch each other eat. That's a little mean, but it really did suck. 

Other than that, the food that we did get to order was decent. Buy personally, I'm not a fan of Asian fusion. I like my Asian food as is. (: (for example, their papaya salad is not how I like my Thai papaya salad :(.....)

ATMOSPHERE
District One has this urban feel to it. Place is spacious and loud, with three sections. The sports bar, main floor and booth. 

SERVICE
Courteous, friendly service. My server suggested some of her favorite dishes and was attentive the entire time. 

FOOD
Not too much of a selection. Menu consist of appetizer, rice, noodle soup and seafood. My friendly server told me that anything with oxtail is popular, and suggested me Oxtail Loco Moco which is not on the menu. Along with that, she also suggested Rice Combo Platter (choice of short ribs or pork chop but you can get both for $4 extra) and Oxtail Fried Rice. 

Oxtail loco moco was good! Not like the Hawaiian loco moco that I imagined it to be with the buttery gravery. Gravy itself had a vietnamese twist with pieces of cilantro. There were plenty of oxtail inside which was super tender. All of this deliciousness with sunny side up egg....perfection.

Maybe we just ordered wrong?  I was super hyped about District One and I even braved the cramped parking lot with our SUV just to try this place out.  But we came away just a bit underwhelmed.  No pop!  No wow!  Just a long, drawn out poot.

District One was hoppin', no joke there.  Sports on the TV, alcohol flowin' freely, and lots of heads on tables.  Very busy but luckily no wait when we visited.  The place is nice - modern, vibey, nice leather booths.  Shiny & new!  But the food...eh...was a bit lackluster.

I love me some Vietnamese food, and I love me some fusion.  But while that may be good and appreciated, I gotta sway back to the classics.  What good is fusion if you don't have the classic down?  Does one not learn how to walk first before trying a 360 kick flip?  Do you just approach Heidi Klum and MInka Kelly without mastering the art of taking the 'grenade'?  I think not.

Perhaps we should have ordered differently at District One, because what we had just didn't impress.  The menu looks delicious, rice dishes, soups, noodles, lots of Asian-inspired cuisine.  But that day I really wanted pho, and the wifey really wanted wings.  

We started off with the Tamarind Wings.  Wow.  For $6, I'm sorry to say, I felt a bit ripped off.  These were 6 of the tiniest @$$ wings I've ever seen!  At $1 a piece damn were they small.  I mean, these wings were literally half the size of those you see at a place like Wing Stop.  Nearly no meat!  I guess I wouldn't have complained if they were some bomb-diggety wings...but...they were bland.  Oh, just bland.  There was a bit of sweetness to them but that was it.  One note.  No mixing of flavors, no sour, no heat, no crunch, no nothing.  I don't think they were properly seasoned as well because I didn't get much of a salty flavor either.  So plain.  This app definitely left the wifey and I hungry and hoping the main dish would fit the bill.

We both stayed basic and got the Pho Bo Vien, the beef pho.  It came to the table steaming hot, nice.  But again....what's with the portion?  The bowl was smaller than what we were used to at other Vietnamese places around town.  And for $8 each, we were a bit surprised.  At other decent places around town, for the same price I can get the special pho with more goodies, and in a bigger bowl.  We got our little plate of veggies as well for sharing.  This included some basil, bean sprouts, and fresh chilies.  The pho was pretty good, District One has some great broth.  Not overly salty, lots of complex flavor, good on the palette.  But boy did I crave for more noodles and more beef to sop this broth up.  

The service for us was excellent.  Server was very attentive, wasn't hesitant to let us know if we had any questions on the menu to just ask.    Water was kept filled.

Overall it was an OK first visit to District One.  The wifey and I left hungry and were eating again less than two hours later.  I think place does warrant another visit, but maybe next time we'll go with the more popular dishes they serve.  I do fancy some Big Bone Soup or some Oxtail Pho!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,0,3,P3qAdPdaDip7VyM1OJbYNg

The food arrived all together, I immediately tried the oxtail pho and it was so tender and soft to the bite. And also had the very crispy spring rolls which wasn't too hot on the inside so I was able to power through the appetizer.

A modern Vietnamese restaurant that has the city talking and even some of the country talking with their introduction to whole lobster pho a few years back.

I didn't dig the interior. It reminds me of Boiling Crab with the log looking tables and wall fixtures. The emphasis on sports and drinking with all of the TV's make it an option to watch sporting events.

The thing about District One is that their pho broth wasn't good. We tried two bowls of pho, oxtail fries, and egg rolls. I had this thought in my head that they really had this modern Vietnamese restaurant that improved on a classic and elevated it, but the pho was so bland. With Vietnamese pho I am a purist. I add my veggies and that's it: no fish sauce no hot sauce, nothing. I had to hook my broth up so much to make it decent. The oxtail fries were good with lots of oxtail meat, but not as good as Bachi's. The egg rolls were so small and the filling very dry and at $9 for 4 pieces was a hard no from me.

I have to give them props on their staff. They have a lot of staff and they are very attentive-you're not only helped by one person.

At the end of the day I would not go back to District One for pho. If I want a good bowl of pho I would definitely try somewhere else. I recommend stepping the broth game up otherwise nothing is enticing.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,1,0,3,EePWqH400K3nEILjqFdFFw

Other than the food, I'm not sure if it's the spacious layout of the restaurant or if it's the trendy casual vibe I feel as soon as I enter. But either way, they found a regular customer in me!

They're mostly known for the Pho but the rest of the menu is amazing! If you're willing to splurge a little extra, your server will bring a Specials Chalkboard to your table with some options for you but otherwise, you'll probably be very satisfied with their menu!

 TO SHARE:

Spring Rolls- Personally was never a fan of spring rolls until I tried the ones here. The rolls taste so fresh that I sometimes tell myself that I'm eating healthy whenever I order these. I also like to ask for no mint just because it tastes too strong but otherwise, I can eat them all day. 

Oxtail Fries- VERY generous with the oxtail meat and the fries. That's all you need to know!

ENTRÉE:

Rice Combo Platter- You get rice, an egg cooked to your preferred taste, sliced Taiwanese sausages, and you get the option of either pork chop or short rib. I HIGHLY recommend asking for both and paying extra! They're BOTH so good that no one should have to choose between one or the other. With a hungry stomach, you'll be able to finish the plate and feel quite full/happy. But if you're not that hungry, I would suggest asking for both meats and sharing it with someone else or taking the rest! It'll be more than enough. 

Never had an issue with service. They know what they're doing!

Came in to try this trendy joint. Again, the first thing you are hit with is the freezing cold. Did I mention to bring a hoodie? Yeah, bring a hoodie.

To warm myself up in the mean time, grabbed a drink. I always a major plus when a restaurant has decent beer. The Sculpin IPA is a very big plus.

The servers were prompt, showed us the specials for the day. There IS lobster pho, but we didn't HAVE lobster money this night so we opted for Oxtail Fried Rice, Pho Oxtail, and the Pho Tai Rib Eye.

The Oxtail Fried Rice ($12.95) is really overpriced. Everyone of their rice dishes seem like that. It was a good portion of rice, but I've had better fried rice (Japaniero) for cheaper. The chunks of oxtail in the rice was tender and delicious. Nothing else really exciting about the fried rice though. Lacking a flavor other than oxtail. So hope you got oxtail in every bite.

The Pho Oxtail is huge, you get the huge bone in there with plenty of oxtail for cheaper than the rice ($11.95). My Pho Rib Eye also had delicious slices of meat. I did think it was a little skimp on meat with a little too much broth. I don't know if it was just me. What I did have though, was delicious. I overdid the sriracha and jalapeno. 

I ended up with bastard broth. The broth was so spicy that my head sweat and I was crying. I finished it all. Why? It was delicious.

The atmosphere and the different specials assures me that I'll be back. I will have to get lobster pho eventually and try out their different appetizers.

Now the broth was aromatic and flavorful.  Next time we're definitely going to try the lobster pho and pork belly buns! And the visit after that we'll try the snails.

I'm not a huge fan of pho but everything else on their menu looked good. So my friends and I came to visit while we were in Vegas. I ordered the oxtail fried rice and it was really good! It was a pretty big portion so I took the rest home. My friends and I shared the oysters that were $3.50 each and they were really good! They were better than the bluepoint ones that we got a dozen of but still pretty good. I tried a little bit of what my friends got as well and we were all pleased with what we got.

4107243,2015-11-03,7,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"After tonight, I'm not sure what the most interesting restaurant in this plaza is.

Mountain View Plaza on Jones between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn is home to other great restaurants such as Asian BBQ & Noodles and Chada Thai and Wine. I finally made a long overdue visit to District One to hang out with old friends. Per their web site, their name is inspired by the old ""epicenter for entertainment and dining"" in yestercentury Saigon, but their cuisine is a fusion of Vietnamese with other Asian cuisines and American flavors. Still, I was definitely able to spot the Vietnamese influence in a lot of dishes.

""Happiest Hours"" are Mon-Fri 5-7pm and Sun-Thu 12am-2am, and we hit the sweet spot of the normal happy hour, so a lot of our dinner consisted of sharing those items:

Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio ($9.99 Happiest Hours / $11.99 regular): beef, citrus soy, sesame & truffle oil, crispy white onion, crushed peanut. The beef pieces are considerably thicker than your average carpaccio, but they weren't too difficult to chew. Fortunately, the truffle oil was used judiciously, so I enjoyed the overall combination of varied flavors and textures.

Belly Buns (2 pc, $3.99 HH / $7.99 reg): braised pork belly, pickled carrot and daikon, cilantro, crushed peanut. Not sold on the supposed presence of cilantro, but the pork belly is prepared a la ""xá xíu"" (aka char siu, aka BBQ pork). In combination with the slaw, it really evokes the flavor profile of banh mi. Execution was inconsistent in that the meat in the encore order lacked fat and consequently seemed drier, but the first order was bursting with juices, and the happy hour price is stellar.

Cajun Garlic Fries ($2.99 HH, not on reg menu?): french fries, fresh crushed garlic, cajun seasoning. The garlic was far more prominent than the cajun spices, which is fine with me. These seasonings were uneven over the plate, but they were really addictive, and it was feasible to cobble together enough from the spillage. Ketchup can cover for that issue too. Also, it's a very nice portion compared to enhanced french fries at other restaurants.

(An interesting food hack that one friend used was to dip fries in the leftover beef carpaccio sauce. I've got to try that next time.)

House Special Oysters ($19.99 for 12): ponzu, caviar. We got this instead of the fresh oyster, which is $1.25 per oyster HH. For the small increase in average-per-oyster price, the ponzu and caviar put an interesting spin on what could have been mundane lemon and cocktail sauce oysters. A small quibble is that the oysters were a bit on the small side, but that's easily solvable with a second order...

Crispy Egg Rolls (4 pc, $4.99 HH, $6.99 reg): pork, mushroom, taro. The overall flavor was really good, especially with the dipping sauce. However, I'm sure most people will agree that there is far too much taro compared to the other parts of the filling. I barely had a problem on this occasion, but my ideal is a more meat-focused egg roll. I would avoid it as a silent protest of sorts, but you should try it once if you haven't.

Fish Tacos (2 pc, $4.99 HH / $9.99 reg): sashimi yellowtail, avocado, cilantro, cherry tomato, serrano pepper in a crispy shell. One of my favorite bites of the night. This does not remind me of anything in Vietnamese cuisine. It's more like the seafood tostadas offered by Soho Japanese Restaurant, This rendition has a medley of flavors, especially when you squeeze the lime wedge into the taco. I enjoyed the reorder of this dish, so I have to rank it above the Belly Buns.

Serrano Pepper Wings ($0.50 each HH, $7.99 reg for ? pc): deep fried wings, supposedly in serrano pepper sauce... wait, what sauce? Yeah, I'm going to ignore that odd description. These are moist, properly seasoned wings - a welcome relief after the relative disaster at Chow in downtown Las Vegas. The crust and flavors remind me of my dad's delicious recipe. Be prepared for the mild inconvenience of having to scoop up the serrano pepper slices and the green onion pieces to flavor variety.

Oxtail Fried Rice ($12.99): shredded oxtail meat, red onion, soy sauce, fried egg (sunny side up). This dish is fairly tame on its own, but it sings glorious harmonies in your mouth when you add a bit of Sriracha sauce. The sweetness, acidity, and heat in the ever-increasingly popular condiment perfectly complement the flavors of the fried rice. It's puzzling that the flavors aren't already in the fried rice recipe, but I don't care after how delicious it was. The only issue is that the oxtail didn't stand out for me. It could have been subbed out for any other reasonable protein.

I truly enjoyed District One. I was impressed with most of what I tried and the happy hour pricing, and nothing was overly disappointing. Come here for HH and bring friends. Perhaps you can enjoy Monday Night Football on the myriad of TV screens as we did. I can't speak for the rest of the menu just yet, but I'm excited to return to explore it.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,9,5,ikZHbhf2G0RBQ7HyxN1YjQ

I like, I don't like it, then I like it again. This is pretty much the feelings I had when visiting District one. If a place projects itself as hipster, does that mean really they are no longer hipster? I got some googling to do.

After a cool yelp night at the Mirage, we decided a late night snack was required and after seeing some nice reviews of District One and throwing it up on my bookmarked places we decided to venture here.

Thursday night, the car park is packed, I have no idea why, maybe something was going on in another business that I didn't see or hear, so make sure you be patient. 

Walking into a near empty restaurant we were seated in a nice booth with a nice window view of some cool cars and neon lights. The layout is actually quite nice, with a nice long bar at the rear of house and nice big Tv's. The centre has 4 tabled chairs with a few booths closer to front of house. This place is a hipster bar, it doesn't seem like a restaurant in china or Asian town.

We were greeted by an extremely nice sever who went through a bit of the menu and made a few recommendations. All prices were very very reasonable, and dishes were quite large.

After looking at a few reviews on yelp we went with the Pork Belly Buns. And I'd like to pass on they were great!! As a main I grabbed the 5 Spice Hen. Little disappointed in this dish, very very dry and a little bland. I tried the Oxtail Soup which was a little difficult to eat but I will say to give it a try!

I like District One, I'm a little unsure how successful it has been, but I do believe the location might hurt them a little. This market would serve better on the strip or in a Green Valley or even in the heart of Summerlin with less Asian restaurant competition.

I'm not sure if management was unprepared but the service and quality was totally absent this second time dinning here.

I ordered the Mekong River Noodle soup, pork belly with coconut juice appetizer and Garlic noodles with shaken beef & egg. I asked for the Noodle soup to be served first and balance of entrees to follow. Unfortunately the waitress brought  Won ton noodle soup which was incorrect,  after telling a different waiter who apologized BC they were busy and redelivered the wonton noodle soup to the table next store. When my correct soup arrived the noodles were flavorful and tasty and consisted of shrimp, quail eggs, sliced pork, chives and yummy broth.  The pork belly arrived secondly and it was tasty over the steam rice. Lastly the garlic noodles were totally a miss - horribly greasy and overpriced at $13.95! The waiter apologized for the poor service and offered me complimentary coconut ice cream dessert which took some time to receive since he never advised the waitress who only showed up once after bringing the wrong soup so she had to confirm the complimentary ice cream with the mangager!

I don't know if I'll return here again or if they're busy....I would avoid this place. I Hope they get their service together and hope this was a fluke incident.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,15,14,3,YqUDOhRLQ5ZmY3VOVt9rVg

There was not anything notable about any of these appetizers.  The chicken wings and the egg rolls were good, but really nothing memorable.  The chicken wings would definitely benefit from an extra dipping sauce - like the fish sauce that came with the egg rolls.  The egg rolls had taro in them, which is why I wanted to come here.  The meat to taro ratio was off, as shown by the slightly mushy texture of the filling.  The pork belly buns come as either steamed or deep fried - I got the steamed.  The buns were not as soft as I hoped and the filling was very skimpy.  French fries were fine, but again, nothing memorable - McDonald's makes better fries.  The fish tacos were good, but tasted kinda odd - a little too fishy?  I think it's a ceviche like filling, but I'm not sure.

Everyone's been telling me about District One and how great their food is, especially the Lobster Pho. Apparently, it was on Buzzfeed, but Buzzfeed hypes up spots so easily and it's really not that great.

My friends from OC and LA said good things and I was like okay, let's give it a try.

First off, I am not a fan of fusion food. 
It takes off the authentic taste of the origin. I am not against the idea, but I am just not into it.

I looked at the Lobster Pho and it just seems extra and not tasty, so I didn't bother. I've tried it before, and I was just not happy with it.

Today, luckily we went with 8 people so I was able to try various options.
Oxtail Pho - Soup was bland, had no flavor.
Eggrolls - I don't know why my basket had so much Basil and Mint. (Yes, I know how to eat Eggrolls correctly) I practically am Vietnamese.
Oxtail Fried Rice - This was the only dish which had flavor. But wow, there was so much oil .... was it the Chinese Sausag??
Steak and Eggs - It's basically the Shaken Beef plate. Rice was bland, the beef was sauteéd with vegetable... but it wasn't mind blowing or anything.
Double down - Garlic noodle... I didn't taste any of the garlic in there. The meat was all whatever.

Overall, there was just no flavor. Presentation is important but what's the point if the food doesn't pull through?",2TwqTjcg_57gow6E7XSdWg,5,5,2,zWaeNi7lO7eQcdsdSFnwNg

-Shaking beef with tomato rice (really flavorful)
-Garlic noodle (so simple but so good, love all the garlic-ness)
-Oxtail fried rice (order mine without onions)

Recently had their pho for the first time, tried the broth before seasoning it with your typical sriracha and housin sauce, it was yummy!

Going to have to say. . . Their lobster pho price is a bit steep. I know it says ""Market Price"", we definitely didn't ask how much it would be (assuming it would be like $28-$35) but when we got the bill, we were taken back and couldn't stop laughing. $49 for a bowl of lobster pho! Yes, the lobster was huge but I do think that's over priced. Maybe it's because lobster doesn't cost that much in WA (even the big ones), lolol.

Our party had the oxtail pho, the bone marrow soup, pho meatball, green papa salad, chef's special steak with fries & corn, and garlic noodles....all were tasty! The only warning I must give though is that the papa salad is NOT like your typical one you know and love. This one is light in flavor and has basil plus meats (shrimp, beef, & pork). Hence, very different. Pho broth was great although there was a lack of sauces and seasoning that you could add yourself...only sriracha and his on available. Service was by far the best I've had.

Oxtail pho ($11.95): gigantic portion... 3 girls each ordered one and we could have shared one. Plenty of oxtail and meat fell right off the bone. Broth was good and noodles had a food bite. Overall wonderful.

Lobster pho (market price ~$29.95): for the price, it actually wasn't that bad. Definitely something to share. I would say it's something you order once, but probably won't order again. Good, but not great. 

Oxtail fried rice ($9.95): my favorite menu item. Plentiful chunks of oxtail mixed on well with buttery rice topped with an egg.

They also have plenty of tables to accommodate bigger parties.  This has always been a favorite when planning big party dinners.  

I've tried a number of appetizers here, but I've stayed true to ordering one entree off the menu, and that's Bun Bo Hue.  On the menu, it's listed as, ""Hue Spicy Beef Noodle,"" and it comes with beef shank, pork loin, and hue pork roll.  It's soo good!  It's unique in the way that it doesn't come off as oily and you don't have to sift through the spices to get to the broth.  Add some lime, cabbage, herbs, and you're good to go!  I rarely ever finish a bowl of pho, but time and time again, i see the bottom of the bowl whenever I'm here.  

They also have good appetizers as well!  I enjoy getting the chicken wings, oysters, and spring rolls.

4413815,2017-08-15,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"District One was not our first choice for dinner, but was a pretty decent back-up option! We actually wanted to eat at Asian BBQ & Noodles next door, but didn't realize that the BBQ place was closed on Fridays - so we ""settled"" for District One. And it was a pretty solid find! 

HAPPY HOUR menu is from 5pm - 7pm and includes quite a nice selection of food & drinks that are TOTES worth it.

[Snacks to share]
1. Belly Buns (steamed) were good but nothing too amazing. 
2. The fish tacos were a refreshingly crunchy bite-sized way to satiate our appetite for a bit. 
3. The Green Papaya Salad was generous in raw shrimp, but was pretty one-dimensional in salty flavor.
4. Beef Carpaccio was super doused in truffle oil, so if that's your thing - you gotttaaaa get it. Just be ready for the fact that it's super bloody! 

[Entrees] 
1. At 6pm on a Friday, they were COMPLETELY sold out of their famous Big Bone Soup, which we were SUPER disappointed by. They said they were sold out since lunch and if we wanted to try it, they had no idea when it would be ready (since it takes hours and hours to make). Our sad faces weren't enough to convince the waitress to try to find some big bones they may have accidentally lying around. Bummer!!
2. Oxtail Fried Rice was probably the winner of the night! Large heaping mound of fried rice was warm, satisfying, and generously served with tender oxtail. It was very simply flavored, but super well done. It WAS a little on the oily side, but it did gave the rice a delicious smoothness. Plus it's served with an egg on top, cooked to whatever style you like! 
3. Garlic Noodles were a close runner-up for the fave of the night. It's simple noodles, cooked in super garlicky oil so you may not see the garlic chunks, but it's there in EVERY SINGLE DELICIOUS BITE! The noodles were firm and had a chewy texture that I would liken to spaghetti that's just perfectly al dente. YUM! 

[Dessert]
The Coconut Ice Cream was a disappointment. The surprise is that it's not coconut-flavored ice cream, it's VANILLA ice cream served in a half-cut coconut, so you get just a wee bit of coconut meat with every bite. It was very dissatisfying and such a misnomer. We totally regret getting this. 

[Overall]
It was a variety-filled meal where you'll definitely find something for everyone. Service was A+ and food came out really quickly! Would recommend if you're feeling munchy and want to get plates to share. Plus there's a HUGE selection of alcoholic drinks to pair with all the feastin'!",WMLrJpSqeQU9us9FTKJFew,3,1,3,265CjfNpwW2p1JX9G9oYgg

Service was superb, after seated our hostess let us know that our waiter would be around soon. After having some time to look over the menu, our waiter arrived and told us about the daily specials and asked if we had any questions about the menu. Very attentive and informative. 

I wanted to try a bit of everything so I ordered: The Five spice hen over tomato rice and pickled, Vietnamese beef carpaccio, Oxtail Pho, Pork belly buns, and the Oxtail Fries. Five spice hen over tomato rice: first off, I'm a sucker for five spice. Then hen was juicy on the inside with a fried crispy other skin. Vietnamese beef carpaccio was different but full of flavor. It was a little heavy on the sauce for my taste on carpaccio but hey its fusion. Perk belly buns, were delicious and juicy. Full of flavor with a soft steamed bun. Oxtail pho, had to try this. Oxtail, in pho? crazy! but they nailed it. I will honestly say, cleanest pho in town. What I mean by clean is, you don't get that heavy feeling of salt ans msg. Just a really good broth with chunks of soft oxtail finger picking goodness. If you have room spring for the oxtail fries. Its topped with a fried egg and oxtail infused gravy.

Never expect this contemporary décor when enjoying Asian/ Vietnamese food.  The wood all around the restaurant, multi leveled, and the beautiful 10-12 seat bar was warm and welcoming,  the aroma around the restaurant made us hungry, I was very excited to see what they had to offer.

After still talking about the décor, the server arrived promptly with menus and the specials of the day.  I was excited to try the entire menu, but settled on Pho Tai Nam. Yes, it's about 98 degrees that day and I decide I wanted hot soup, don't judge!! My friend ordered the Belly Buns. Although, I did not get a chance to try her dish, she couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  My soup was awesome, what was great about the dish was the after part.  After having Pho, at some places, I become growingly thirsty, not so much with District One's pho.  It was full of flavor, right about of onions, and did not have whatever component that makes you thirsty. Kuddos!!

I am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept. The food was definitely fusion, I mean where can you get fish tacos and chicken wings at any other Vietnamese restaurants.   I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients;  the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about. 
Sure, this visit was brief, but I will definitely be back to try it out again and again.  Next time, I'll bring more reinforcements and will venture into the King Crab, Oysters, and the Down and Dirty options! Can't wait!

I personally think District One is underrated. I've been several times in the past few years - and my experiences have all been quite delightful! 

Food: 
Pretty good, however, the main reason why they get 4 stars and not 5. It's not over the top impressive but there are some tasty dishes I've enjoyed! 

- Shaken Beef Salad:
Greens topped with Extremely tender pieces of flavorful marinated meat and dressing 

- Grilled Whole Squid 
A dish I never get sick of, sliced grilled squid that comes with a spicy (siracha mayo?) aioli for dipping 

- Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup 
Great heat, decent flavor, not a lot of noodles but comes with a variety of different meats 

I've also tried various specials of the day including fresh oysters, king crab legs, whole boiled sea snails (in the shell) - all were tasty and unique

Service:
Very friendly bartenders and servers! Servers are knowledgeable about the menu and provide the specials of the day, which always vary 

Ambiance: 
Hip and visually appealing. Lots of seating available: bar, tables, and booths. I love the large comfortable booths! 

Overall District One is a fun spot to grab food and drinks, great for all occasions. If you haven't checked it out I would definitely recommend it!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,9,9,4,P2vdzWUBrQ-GG7G3f9p8EQ
4448183,2017-11-22,2,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"What attracted me to District One and avoided District 9's drama altogether with Katniss? Lobster pho... duh.

Did we end up actually ordering this $60 sucker? Nope, but we did end up feasting on some pretty good New-American/bougie Vietnamese at this trendy restaurant off the Strip. It's a sports bar vs. Asian restaurant that is sure to satisfy your hunger needs.

My friends and I came during our recent Vegas trip since everyone was raving about how great the food is even if it's a bit pricier than other spots. My large group of eight ended up ordering a bunch of appetizers and mains for ourselves that were quite delicious.

Warning: their portion sizes here are fairly generous and you can really get full off an appetizer and maybe half a main!

We started off with their oxtail fries ($12) which came in a huge bowl with plenty of oxtail meat and a fried egg on top. You have to mix and mash all the ingredients in the bowl together to get the best effect. We ended up taking some home because there was no way we were finishing that bowl. We also got some wings to share and they were decent hot wings. Crispy and tender, and definitely curbed our cravings.

As for me, I went for the big boy bowl and got the ""Big Bone Soup,"" ($18) which was essentially a large chunk of meaty bones with bone marrow. They do not play when it comes to the name- for the bowl is simply big. You cut off slices of flank from the bone and dig out the delicious bone marrow hidden inside. Simply amazing and incredibly filling.

The waitress convinced me to get a side bowl of pho noodles for $5 which you honestly don't need given how much food is in the soup.

District One was able to satisfy all of us and we left with big tummies ready to take on the rest of the day. If you want some good Asian with bomb portions, definitely check this spot out. As my friend would say though if you're considering just the pho: ""get something you wouldn't find anywhere else, and would you really pay thaaat much for a bowl of pho?""

The choice is yours.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,2,4,4,9B0vRFFkvAnE-7LlU0-3RQ

This place does a nice job of making classic Vietnamese dishes current. They've created a place that caters to the yuppy community in a cool and sleek place with also a gastropub vibe. 

I wouldn't come here though for the pho straight up though. Like the pho was good, but I feel like this place is more palatable to introduce pho to Americans than it is as your go-to pho spot if you're a pho connosseiour like cough cough...I didn't spell connesousiour right and my spell check won't help because it's so off. 

But this place is cousin's with one of the regular Pho spots so that makes it authentic right? And did you know restaurants can be related? 

We got oxtail pho which was good. The oxtail was tender like it should be. The soup was good.

We also had the pork belly, which my sister really liked. And a steak salad which was good but awkward because the steak was flavorful and sauced and it seemed like it was just plopped onto some lettuce. I think they could refine that a bit more. Maybe less greasy for the steak?

I got the pork chop and short ribs plate with chinese sausage. That was my favorite obvi cause I ordered it. But sometimes at Viet places the pork chop is dry. This was not the case. For four bucks extra you can get pork chop and ribs and because i'm a baller (BALLA!) i got both. Well my parents paid that's why I got both. But the short ribs were great just like Koreans make. The chinese sausage was good. 

So in my opinion I think come here for the other dishes besides the Pho. 

A lot of people talk about this place and it has a ""buzz"" going on. Whatever that means. But my other friend from LA was there and took her co-workers from CES there. So it MUST be good. Nah but it is.",qc1CYNRValSIHBRKodT_fg,1,1,5,MZmsGeRYcL8T0HcfRLOl8Q
4495792,2014-06-11,46,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Holy my Moly. This is another restaurant that gets me hard.

District One is a hidden gem. I typically visit this establishment at least once for all my trips to vegas. In fact, its the first place that I stop by when I drive to Vegas from Cali. Food/Eating taking priority over Partying/Drinking...what is going on?? Yah its that guud! Its known as the ""new Go-To spot"" for all people of Las Vegas. I love PHO. I REALLY DO LOVE PHO. Simple, light, and delicious. What originally caught my attention about this restaurant was that they had OXTAIL pho and BONE MARROW pho. WHAT?? Yes...an oxtail where the meat falls right off the bone like butter and a delicious bone marrow with TONS and TONS of tendon. The sight of the bone marrow and oxtail makes all foodies say the 3 magic letters: O, M, G.  The protein and meats were absolutely delicious. The noodles were perfect and weren't too soggy and the basil and leaves were fresh to perfection.

(Fun Fact: Tendon is high in protein and low in fat)

Anywho...

When Im intoxicated beyond belief, or when I have any sort of alcohol in my system, the number 1 thing I crave is Soup and Noodles, in particular: PHO. And when Im hungover as hell the next morning, my number 1 cure is PHO. Being drunk in Las Vegas is fun, but being drunk w/o any delicious food to be consumed sucks. I wish there was a 24/7 buffet. Tacos El Gordos isn't as great as the original location in SD. Steak and Eggs for some cheap price just doesn't cut it. Earl of Sandwich gets boring. And who wants to pay for overpriced room service?? 

PHO is my answer! Another cool thing about this place is that its open till 3 AM. And another cool thing about this location is that they serve lots and lots of craft Beers. I had a Soba Ale created by Chef Morimoto...this is an ABSOLUTE MUST TRY!

If your drunk, or if your looking for a place with great Vietnamese food, come out to District One. This place has a 4.5 star rating for a reason! This is a must-visit for all foodies, especially those people (*cough asians) who love to take pictures of their own food. This Bone Marrow is a must-see-in-person type of deal! This place gets me hard, and I love everything about this restaurant, everything from the customer service, to meeting the managers, to the decor, and the plating.

We've been wanting to try this place for awhile so it actually worked out perfectly. We came on a Friday around 6 pm with 6 people and were able to easily get a table. Throughout our entire meal the servers were super helpful and friendly.

To start the meal we took advantage of their happy hour specials and went with some house oysters, belly buns, and crispy egg rolls. We also had to add in some drinks of course too so we shared the asahi pitcher of beer and a sake flight. Hands down my favorite part of the entire meal was the house oysters. They were super fresh and came topped with a ponzu sauce and jalapeño. I honestly could have eaten just a dozen of these by myself. As for the belly buns and egg rolls they were just alright to me. I felt they could have been a bit more flavorful, but overall still good. Next for entrees I went with the garlic noodles and fish tacos. The noodles were good, but a little bit bland. I added some hot sauce to give it a little extra kick. The fish tacos though, amazing! They're a bit on the smaller side, but the perfect size with a side of noodles.

I'm so glad we came here and I can't wait to get back and go ham on some house oysters!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,3,4,5,wSPYeAN03MXI7cvqLM3Q5w

So, I finally had the chance to go and eat here with a few other peeps.  You know how it goes when there are more mouths to feed, more chances to try more food on the menu! Yesssssss.  We were greeted by a few of the staff and they began by telling us all the awesome things they had on special that night.  In nice resturant lingo like ""Chef has prepared...."" Hey District One, nice touch on selling your menu.

District one is the old Cravin Cajun.  They fixed up the restaurant really nice.  Plenty of room if you have a big party.  Ono (delicious) to the grinds.

We had oysters, squid, chicken wings, papaya salad, quail...and that is just to name a few.  Of course, I still managed to get Oxtail Pho.  I still like another Pho place because their Pho broth is bomb, but the price they charge here would actually bring me back because of that.  It wasn't bad pho broth.  They actually gave HUGE oxtails.  By the way, if you still want your crawfish/crab/shrimp boil fix, you can still get it from District One.  Think I will have to try that they next time.   And the pork belly seems to be a hit so I better try that too.  

My hubs liked it because they had a lot of his favorite Asian Whiskeys.  See Jesse N :)

Well they made me a fan. As you can tell from my review I will be back.  I hope the hype stays good since I've seen this place change up a few times.  The variety they offer is awesome because everyone at the table should get different Asian fixes here...Yup, I said that.  Lil' asian me.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,2,1,4,d1fErmpg86yRPQkdacR2hw

Food:  During my visit here, my friend and I shared the oxtail fries, half a dozen house special oysters and we both got our own order of the Pho tai rib eye. Call us piggies, we have NO SHAME! 

Oxtail Fries: COMFORT FOOD ALERT
The oxtail fries definitely hit the spot, it kind of reminded me of Chinese beef stew but they substituted the cubed potatoes for french fries. YOU MUST FINISH IT WHEN DINING IN. Since we got a little carried away with ordering, we had to to-go most of it and let's just say it did not look pretty. The sauce became clumpy when it cooled, so i just ate the oxtail and threw away the rest. 

House special oyster: 
The oysters were super yummy and fresh. I do not remember the actual name and description the waitress gave us but GET THIS! All I remember about this dish is it had a tangy sauce and fish eggs on top. Hopefully this helps :/ !

Pho tai rib eye: 
I love PHO and this place knows how to make it right. The soup tasted really good and tasted of little to no MSG. The noodles  were also cooked perfectly. My only complaint about this dish was that the texture of the beef slices were inconsistent. Some were extremely tender, while others were really tough so I was so pretty sad about that. 

Service: Our waitress was really attentive and helpful. It was our first time here and she went through the menu/ specials with us and also came by to refill our waters a couple times.   

Final Verdict: I will definitely be back for the oysters/ oxtail fries and not to mention their pork belly buns! Let's see if this place tops the LA version at Dip's Grill.. we will have to just wait and see !",8-S4AUMpk_3ZKQQbWgiwvQ,1,3,4,9VLLtOrmWLLp09Q6lXydAQ

People park everywhere and anywhere they can find space lol. 

But anyway, we both ended up ordering the steak and eggs + oxtail fries. My steak and eggs ended up having heaps of onions rather than meat, but I suppose it was a good amount to get me full. They give you a lot of rice as well. The sauce they use seems like it's missing a little something, but I give this place props for trying. 

The oxtail fries.... I've definitely had better, but my boyfriend seemed to like them since they ""weren't as sweet as others."" Bachi Burger oxtail fries over District One oxtail fries any. day.

This day was no different. I was fiending for some amazing, Chinatown-like pho tai. Surely, most places on the 9th island would disappoint. I searched Yelp for hours, meticulously going through review after review, photo after photo and eyeing up each restaurants website. I felt like a crazed person. But I NEEDED some good pho...I needed something familiar and reminiscent of home.

Finally came across District One which was about 15 minutes from my workplace, great reviews, pics looked promising... Skeptical, I ordered take away from them anyway. Got the pho tai and egg rolls.

Food was ready when I got there, the server helping me was friendly and trying to sell me on the happy hour but not in a pushy, salesman type of way. Got back to work, spread all this vietnamese goodness across an entire lunch table, and to my surprise...they packaged the meat separately and uncooked! HALLELUJAH!!!! I like my meat still kicking because that's where all the flavor is so I really enjoy dipping the beef in for 5-7 seconds, taking it out and eating it. There's nothing I hate more than precooked, overcooked, flavorless meat. Added my sprouts, peppers, lime, basil, hot sauce, hoisin sauce, noodles.

""I told you to separate our checks!!!""

I mean seriously this rating is not about just the food but the customer service.  Ok first the location - super busy area.  Parking is limited at night.  The inside is hipster authorized and designed.  It's rustic and country modern.  I love  that your waiter is quick at taking orders.  But I specified and said it TWICE to make sure we have a separate check because I didn't feel like paying for 10 people (which I ended up doing!).  Plus TIP was automatically included at 18%!!! Are you serious? Even in NYC they don't do that.  At least 15% and give me the option to pay you more.  Ok Sorry D 1 but you are about to get the BIG D from me.   So I ordered the pork rib meal - $13.99 I believe and the fried spicy calamari.  A beer and wine.  And my total ended up $180 and change.  I mean seriously? Anyway, so the calamari came! Wow that's a lot of breading for a chewy octopus.  I wish I had the jaw power of a hyena or a pitbull to eat it.  It was gnarly to chew on it.  The dip was nice and yummy.  It was spicy that it made me smile.  The  short ribs was super hard and overcooked.  The sausage that came with it was the cheap shriveled hot dog. The egg tasted like it was microwaved.  This place get's a lot of high praises but I was not happy at all.  The waiter even took 20 minutes to come with my beer.  I love the guy but COME ON! I want to get lit but instead I got burnt.  Anyway, I was charged $20 for my wife's wine.  I get that price but at least bring it in a nice cleaner glass.  Anyway, overall this place is super hyped.  I might  love it if I was just eating the chicken wings.  Maybe I'll come back during happy hour.  Overall, it was an ok experience.  It's not impressive at all.  Maybe I can be impressed next time I visit Vegas.

I came with a few Yelpers (The Q's, David V., and Paolo) and it was a new experience for most of us. We shared both of their chicken wings selections; Tamarind Wings ($6.95) and Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings ($6.95). The wings were fried without a batter and tossed/dressed in light sauces of their respective flavors. Both selections were bland, lacking a pinch of salt, however, the Garlic Serrano had great flavor potential. Without a batter, the wings lacked any type of crunch or bite. Additionally, the orders came with pickled vegetables (carrots and daikon) that were good! We also tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio ($10.95), served with lime juice, white onion, and peanuts. The sauce (soy sauce and oil base) was very tasty and it made the beef taste amazing.

Everyone ordered their own dishes, like Fish Tacos ($8.95), Tomato Rice (side order; $1.50), and the District One Rice Combo Platter ($11.95). The fish tacos were made with hamachi sashimi, avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomato in fried wonton ""shells"" and came in a set of three. It was okay, but nothing special. The tomato rice also lacked flavor and warranted a shrug. For the Combo Platter, you can choose between chargrilled short ribs or pork chop and it comes with kimchee, pickled vegetables, lap xuong (Chinese sausage), and a fried egg. The chargrilled short ribs were good and had a nice ""char"" flavor (no marinade).

I ordered the Slow Braised Pork Belly in Young Coconut Juice ($8.95), served with a soft boiled egg, and Jasmine rice. This was really delicious! The meat was soft and tender and the sauce created from the coconut juice and pork belly was fragrant. I threw my whole bowl of rice into the stone pot to utilize every drop of the succulent sauce. Even if there weren't any other successful dishes, I would come back just for pork belly coconut juice! Everyone else seemed to really enjoy it as well.

Service was really nice! We didn't realize that we had stayed almost an hour after their closing time, however, they were really cool about it. I like the menu because of its focus on Vietnamese fusion and obviously, that makes it unique. I don't eat Pho, but the MP Lobster Pho is definitely enticing! Not sure how much the price fluctuates, but it was approximately $27 last week. Anyway, I'm willing to give the other dishes a try and if anything, I'll always have the pork belly as a back-up plan!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,5,5,3,Qkgu3sxOsLx79_vD1GLPGg

We tried the spicy noodles, pork belly bun, and steak rolls. All were good dishes, nothing that blew our minds out, but flavors were well developed. The spicy noodles could have used more meat and more spice. It definitely was a good take on a very traditional vietnamese dish. The fried pork belly buns was a cool take on the traditional bun. I mean... ""anything fried makes it better' right?! I liked that extra crunch to contrast the tender pork belly. Finally the steak roll was subpar for me.

We ordered Belly Buns, Papaya Salad, and Serrano Chicken Wings. They have a decent menu with Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai choices. I am being generous with my 4 stars as 1 star each for service, atmosphere, menu selection and concept. The food was not the greatest though. I did not like the Belly Buns as they lacked flavor and the Belly was dry and small. I've had belly bao with a thick tender caramelized pork belly with pickled garnish and these were not good at all. The papaya salad lacked sweetness which would have balanced the sour and salty taste. The wings were crispy and big but they didnt give all flats. The drummette piece tasted dry and horrible. Usually in Asian joints they give you all flats when you order fried wings so that was disappointing. I did see the table next to is ordered a Black Pepper Dungeness Crab that looked pretty good.

I started with the stuffed jalapeno appetizer, which was just, well, kind of boring. Ground seasoned chicken on top of a cut-in-half grilled jalapeno with marinara sauce on top, super basic ya'll.

Next I had the oxtail fried rice and omg that stuff needs to come with a warning label, ox tail tastes like dirt.

1.) Chicken pho was not made w chicken broth! I order chicken pho specifically for that reason. Instead, they use beef broth. I know this isn't a 'strictly pho' joint, so they probably use the same broth for all of their phos. 

2.) Oxtail fried rice was too mushy & wet for my liking. I like my fried rice drier in texture & this seemed almost porridge like..something was missing in flavor too. There was a good amount of oxtail meat though!

3.) Whole grilled squid-probably the best out of the 3 dishes we (bf & I) tried. The spicy aioli was okay, but I would have preferred this dish w ponzu.

It's a Vietnamese fusion. There were 2 of us so we sat at the bar, which is a full bar but we ordered their specialty drinks along with 5 food items.

Vietnamese donkey: 5/5 basically a lychee Moscow mule. Very light

Fresh coconut mojito: 5/5 it comes in a real coconut and tastes very refreshing. They also give you coconut juice on the side to drink as well

Pork belly buns: 4/5 good appetizer, nothing amazing. They used Vietnamese radish and carrots which was different but it didn't blow me away. 

Oxtail fries: 5/5 I loved it! Definitely recommend this as an appetizer or even a side dish. The meat was very tender and had a pulled pork consistency. It comes with a sunny side up egg too so if you don't want it to get too soggy just put the fries to the side and break the egg on the other side and dip it in 

Garlic noodles: 4/5 pricey for what it is. It was on the dry side and the garlic flavor wasn't completely there but the garnishes added a fresh flavor to it 

Shaken beef: 5/5 super tender and they used the more traditional Vietnamese butter rice I believe. This entree also came with eggs and you get to choose how it's cooked

Short rib combo plate: 4/5 short ribs were marinated very well and tasty, but portion on that was small. I only got 1 small slab of kalbi and the Chinese sausages were hard so I only had a bite of that and I was done. I liked that they also included an egg in the meal so I had it sunny side up so the yolk dropped over my rice when I punctured it.. Yummmm I love runny yolk

My bf and i started with the razor calms at $14.95. They were meaty but flavor was only ok. We also got the fish tacos which were pretty good. It came with three wantons skins fried and shaped like taco shells and filled with yellow tail and added veg. My bf got the oxtail pho. I thought the broth was very flavorful and i enjoyed it alot. The oxtail was fall off the bone tender. I had the district one rice combo. That included a large heap of white rice with a fried egg on top, pretty spicy kim chee, pickled veg, a small and thin but very tender and full of tasty goodness pork chop. The seasoning on it was to die for. Lastly it was suppose to have chinese sausage. My food came out and i noticed the sausage i was really looking forward wasnt on my plate. I told the waiter that explained yo mr thats what i ordered. I told him that what i read on the menu was different so he went to check then to the kitchen then back to me. He apologized and said the kitchen ran out of the sausage which i have never heard of a kitchen running out of a regular item on a menu that is in fact offered twice on the menu, even worse 168 supermarket is across the street and houses about 20 varities of chinese sausage. I was quite disappointed and shocked that the kitchen didnt inform my waiter and i guess i wasnt suppose to notice. To appease me they brought out free coconut ice cream that too was yummy. Upon heading to the bathroom i saw food come out with the sausage. I asked a waiter and they said i saw it correctly. I called the manager over who was comfortably dressed in running pants and nikes and explained what happened. She told me they did run out if the sausage and sent someone to the store after i was served and she felt the ice cream was a nice enough gift. I told her it was but i wanted the sausage now that was suppose to be in my meal to begin with she said the she thought the ice cream would have taken care of that which i replied that i would pay for ""her kind gift"" if its a issue but i wanted my sausage. I hate to say im coming back cause clearly customer service is lacking but i really enjoyed the food.

They are all over the news & is one of the top Las Vegas restaurants.  In Sài Gòn (Viet Nam),  District 1 is where all the actions are, and features some of the best cuisines of the country.  This D1 restaurant represents well what Sài Gòn has to offer; really brought us close to home!

They feature some of the most authentic Vietnamese dishes with a twist in style or presentation.  They are comfort foods that you come in not necessarily because you are hungry, but because you crave some of the dishes that mom & grandma haven't cooked in awhile.

This joint is owned & operated by my friend, Chef Khai Vu.  I tell ya what, I am really glad that I loved everything that I ate there, so now I can wholeheartedly endorse this restaurant & truthfully feel great about backing it!

I knew I had to try it after hearing him talk so highly of it. Without looking at any of the pictures, I came here on a whim.

Immediately seeing the doors, I could already tell this was going to be far from authentic. It has the American western spin and style on the decor, the the atmosphere, and the food itself. There was not a speck of Vietnamese on the menu. Everything was in English. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing. I was just expecting full blown Vietnam when he told me authentic.

My gf and I ordered the oxtail fries, pho Bo vien, and I got the steak and eggs.

The oxtail fries came out at the same time as my steak and eggs, leaving no gap between appetizer and entrée.

The oxtail fries were a 1/10 for me. The attempt to blend fries with a soupy oxtail gravy broth results in a soggy mess of flavors that do not complement each other. It actually became worse as I ate more and more. Initially I thought it would garner a 3/10 but as I said the flavors were fighting each other in my mouth, and maybe even my stomach.

My entrée was the steak and eggs but should be called steak and egg. The shaky beef was delicious and pretty amazing. The rice itself was bland in my opinion but it might have been part of the experience to emphasize the shaky beef flavoring.

My girlfriend got the pho meatballs and told me they were between a four and a six. So I'll say five.

All in all this meal was mediocre for way too much. And I still have the aftertaste of the oxtail fries in my mouth hours later.",-f2DPi9DdaRkO3spZ0Uh3g,2,0,2,M-qi4hlw5q5_a2Xa8EDJ5Q

I first heard of District One when another Yelp friend posted some delicious looking food on her FB. I had some friends in town who LOVE new Asian spots, so I took them here.

Our server was really friendly and seemed knowledgeable of the menu. It was a bit strange that they read the specials literally off of the specials board, so that if you want to see it again you have to get up and go look at the board by the entrance. We ordered apps, but they came out with the regular food - this seems to be consistent with all Vietnamese restaurants, no such thing as coursing. However edamame never showed up so we had to ask for it. She must have forgotten to ring it in, but it was our very LEAST favorite thing so maybe she was trying to do us a favor.

Onto the food!

Edamame - it's covered in this very fishy sauce. I love fish sauce but I couldn't eat more than a couple of these. Server said you can order them naked, so next time for sure. 2/5

District One combo platter - this is short ribs and a sweet sausage with rice and over easy egg on top. The short ribs were lean, which was good. 3.5/5

Oxtail friend rice - This was my favorite. We ordered with scrambled eggs though since someone in our party doesn't like runny yoke. Next time though, I would try with the over easy egg. 5/5

Lobster special - This was served cut into sections but rearranged as a whole. The flavor was awesome, but you get about 4 bites of lobster. I guess if you like the stuff in the head, might be worth it, but none of us touched that. Ugh. 3/5

Mango salad - This seriously tasted exactly like Thai or Lao papaya salad. It was good. 4/5

Pork belly buns - These were delicious! Really awesome flavor, and I loved the crunchiness of the peanuts. 5/5 

Vietnamese Donkey cocktail - this is their version of Moscow Mule, but they incorporate lychee. It's simply BRILLIANT. I could've drank 10 of these if one didn't already leave me with a slight buzz in my head. 5/5

This is a fun spot to bring friends, but keep in mind it's a bit pricey. The ambiance is great though and I'd love to go back soon.  A lot of things on the menu that I still want to try.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,3,2,4,oZTDDmu_WGoGrij0JkK5RA

Got the Japanese oysters to start and they were of course very good (not my first rodeo). 
Cornish hen rice dish
Bun bo hue (I think it was named spicy soup on the menu) 
Bird's nest
Lobster fried rice
Bo luc lac salad 
Some veggie dish 

Everything is great. The Cornish hen is so crispy and juicy. It's not that dry, but it does lack flavor. I basically used all of my fish sauce that it came with. But the rice is great too - it's not super easy making that rice right. 

Spicy soup is great, but don't expect it to taste like traditional bun bo hue. 

Bird's nest - fun, crispy noodles with stir fried veggies. Good, but I'd never get again. 

Lobster rice: yummmm but it's pricey. I've had better, but this one is solid, though on a bit on the oily side. 

The menu is smaller than general viet places but it's good. I don't think a lot can go wrong. 

Service is ok - not rude like usual Asian places, but not on the ball either. A full bar is offered, so you can drink away and it's a GREAT place to watch sports. They have a ton of tha everywhere with the latest games, so you can watch the cowboys whip butt. (But more likely be whipped...)

First and foremost, district one is a Vietnamese-based restaurant with a wonderful variety of traditional dishes but it's also a nice bar with a hip decor suitable for a first date or watching a game with friends. 
I tried the four dishes:
Vietnamese carpaccio which was melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious
Cabbage and shredded chicken salad - this is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes and this one was the best I've ever eaten. It was clearly made to order with the mint still being crispy and nothing feeling soggy or stagnant. I'm hungry even thinking about it and I ate it a week ago. 
Clay pot - this was a hearty and savory comfort food which was delicious but not as light as the other two
Sautéed water spinach with tofu - perfectly cooked, not overly oily, the perfect amount of garlic and delicious. 

I would highly recommend this place for locals as a restaurant or as a bar which happens to have fantastic food. I would also recommend it to Las Vegas visitors who want a temporary escape from the strip and it's blinding lights.

Phenomenal Ox Tails!! 

I and my friends were stopping by Vegas after a short visit to the seven magic mountains. I and my buddies were looking for a place to grab a bite and stumbled across of District one.

This venue looks pretty modern and urban on the inside. The layout and designs of the walls felt identical to how the boiling point franchise in southern California look like. There's a bar with a menu full of many different assorted alcoholic drinks and a lot of seating areas for customers.

When we looked at the menu, we noticed that there are assorted dishes that consist of Oxtail. It's not common for a restaurant to serve Ox tail dishes, so we figured that we would try some. We ordered the Ox tail pho, Ox tail fried rice, and Ox tail fries. These dishes were amazing!
Each bite into the oxtail was extremely delicious and juicy. The meat of the Oxtail was perfectly balanced between chewy and tender in all three dishes. Although if i were to pick a favorite out of the three, Oxtail pho was by far the best. I want to say that it's better than the restaurants in the bay area that serve Oxtail.

Highly recommend making the trek from the strip for some good Vietnamese eats here!

* Ox Tail Fried Rice - 5 stars: The oxtail fried rice was chock full of delicious ox tail, a little oily as expected but so tasty. I liked that it was not overly fatty 
* Pork Belly Buns - 5 stars: Recently went to a food event, Cochon 5050 in Napa which featured  restaurants serving all types of pork. This dish could stand head to head against those dishes. So tender, so flavorful, meaty, delicious! Next time, would order the buns unfried.

Oxtail french fries look appealing but not a practical dish in my opinion, the fries were way too soggy and the oxtail marmalade just doesn't mix as it is much greasier at taste than when you have loaded fries (melted cheese and bacon). If the fries were very crispy, I'd enjoy the dish.

Papaya salad was decent but the big bone soup took the show for me. I enjoyed it as it had a lot of taste. The broth did need a lot of lime (but that is my own preference). What a presentation! Although they should consider machine sawing it to smaller piece so you can actually chew at it. 

The bun bo hue was enjoyable. But the grilled squid wasn't too great for me. I enjoy Cafe Moda's squid better, it is not chewy and was too dry.

They did forget about my Hennessy cafe su da but I ended up reminding them and they comped it. Honestly I'd rather this place 3-3.5 stars but I'll give it 4 for the customer service.

Place has awesome decor and is definitely a place to try. But I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.

The only complaint I have was that the squid was too spicy for my liking and was over-grilled. Otherwise everything else was delicious! Seriously, this place tastes ten times better than how it actually looks. It looks like any normal pho place but tastes better than any Vietnamese restaurant that I've ever had. Their cuisine is definitely modern and trendy and everything is packed with flavor.

Then the drinks! I had a moscow mule with a lychee and this was very good. There was also a coconut mojito that was served in an actual coconut and this was also delicious. 

For dessert, we had the creme brulee which was pandan flavored, I believe (like the green Asian fruit cakes, if you're familiar with those). And I did not think I would like it since I'm loyal to the classic creme brulee but this was once again, delicious! Packed full of flavor.

The waitress brought over a chalkboard menu with specials and explained each one. We decided to get the oxtail fried rice off this menu. I thought this was pretty yummy fried rice as the rice was flavored well and there was plenty of chunks of oxtail in the rice. It had one egg on top, but it definitely needed more as after mixing it up into the rice, it sort've disappeared so perhaps consider getting a extra egg if you're a egg slut like me.

We also got the fried cornish hen with tomato rice. I rarely ever see cornish hen on menus, which is unfortunate as it's a more juicy,personal sized chicken. The fry on the bird was good, light crisp and it had a pleasant seasoning on it where I detected a hint of cinnamon that was lovely. If you love natural style fried chicken (no heavy kfc style breading) then this might be your jam. I was into this, it reminds me of Maxs Filipino style chicken that I grew up eating. 

Our server was pretty good about checking in on us. I like that this place is clean, modern  and has a young atmosphere with upbeat dance music.

Service: 3 - They were good and attentive, but they are definitely prone to lots of mistakes.

Greeted as we entered, and seated after 10 minutes of walking into the establishment. It has the seafood/crab shack feeling, with wood top tables with an urban feel. 

After being seated, TK gave us the rundown of what the specials of the day was. Quite a few interesting choices, but eventually went with the Dungen. Very friendly staff, well except for one young female who collected our food to pack to go. She seemed irritated, mad, frustrated. Whatever it was, lucky it came at the end of the meal, cause we were quite happy with the food. Where's the smile at girl!? 

What ordered:
Ox tail fries
Spring rolls
Whole Dungeness special with garlic noodles.
Pho Oxtail
Pho Tai Nam
Pho Tom

Record time food service. From live to stirfried, the dungeness came out in a fairly quick and reasonable time limit. Everyone's food came all together and presented very well. Too bad they didn't have the bone maroc soup, but that just gives us a reason why we should be back. 

There is a full bar for those who want to have a drink with their meal. The atmosphere is casual and inviting. The parking gets crowded because of competing businesses, but not scarce. 

Definitely will come back. Hopefully by then, their busser/server will have a smile then. Otherwise check out TK and the rest of the staff at District One.",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,4,4,5,MgLm1ad_TZ4fbgiX91mTxQ

This was well seasoned and prepared w/the nice contrast of flavors from the topping and further accented w/the pesto on the bottom of the seared potato mash. This place is smart too, because the bowls of soup come in one good size, to make things quick and simple. The lobster ribeye was an even better portion reasonable for the type of food you get. This is a place I can appreciate because of the young fusion aspect that our Era or generation now have grown to expect. I would recommend this place if your into Asian and American variety or looking for a place to hang out w/a group for some fun.

The second is District One.   This is what pho should taste AND smell like.

""Huh, I didn't notice"" I say looking around at my two Asian poker buds and a restaurant filled with Asians watching March Madness.

""You guys order for me so I don't stand out"" he continues.

""Whatever"" I say, my voice brightening as my fellow buds break into huge grins. 

District One has come into its own.  The menu has been refined.  The list of cocktails greatly improved.  Outstanding selection of Japanese whiskey and other brown libations.  Inviting with all the elements to back up a great experience.

To start, sea snails in a beautifully infused chili, basil, lemongrass broth is outstanding.  Chewy as they should be, the broth has the distinct smell of the sea (like boiling stones collected from the ocean) with good herbaceous overtones greatly enhances the flavor.

The Vietnamese beef carpaccio is different in a good way.  Thin slices of beef are arranged on a plate, lightly torched before being drowned with sesame, citrus, and soy.  Basil, mint, a bit of truffle oil all enhance the minearality of the beef.  Crushed peanuts and thin slics of onion add texture.  A squeeze of fresh lime makes the flavors explode.

The grilled whole squid so simple and so good.  Plump, not very tender but not dried.  Light charred bitterness and aggressive seasoning.  It doesn't need the accompanying spicy aioli (taste like siracha and mayo)

For larger dishes, the fried whole fish.  Deep fried, finished in a sweet tangy sauce supported by raw onions, fresh cilantro, and green pickled papaya.  Good eats.  Some places are overcooked and slightly tough, it adds to the rustic nature of the dish.

The lobster pho (whole 1.5lb Maine lobster) remains excellent; the broth becoming incredibly rich and flavorful if you mix in the tamale of the lobster.  Eat this quick else the tail rapidly overcooks and becomes tough.  

Finally, the ""Big Bone Soup"" remains very good.  Loads of marrow and great extraction make for an unctious soup that delivers on flavor.

Very good, attentive service with just the right amount of casual familiarity.

Excellent libation list and well made craft cocktails that perfectly match their flavors.

Solid, solid, solid and worthy as one of the best ""modern"" Vietnamese eateries in the city.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,31,31,4,o-qvBOBo6bfWMCRbbU5mig

We came here on Friday night to try out this new lovely place. It wasn't busy and we were immediately seated. 
The waitress was very attentive and took our orders quickly. 

We ordered - 

Fish Tacos
Very good. I wish they made a larger size so you can have it as an entree. Who wants little bitty tacos?!?
Shaken Beef Salad
Very good. It was a good mix of sweet and spicy, very flavorful!
Garlic Serrano Wings -
Not very spicy in our opinion, but still very good. It had a very good flavor and the wings were cooked perfectly. They were SUPER garlicy though. So much you can taste that shit the next day.
The short rib combo plate -
The ribs were very good, it's the only thing on the plate that has flavor besides the bowlful of garlic kimchi which I stayed away from. 

Overall, the food, was very good. They have a good alcohol selection and they have TV's up everywhere playing sports as well. It's very clean and ""hip"" inside.

Both time, for those Sunday Vegas Hangover Cures, I've gotten the oxtail pho. Omgggg, to die for, honestly. Also, their broth is a bit different from other Pho restaurants I've been too, but not in the bad way! 
They are also known for their lobster pho, which I have yet to try, but I am sure trying it the next time I go. I've also tried their Vietnamese Coffee, and that definitely lived up to expectations.

5195181,2017-06-21,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Yum, this is my favorite pho place in Vegas, actually even in SoCal...as far as flavor goes. The oxail pho is what me and my hubby got. The broth is so so flavorful. The little specks of fat floating around from the oxtail /drooool. So you might be wondering why I gave it  2 stars instead of the 4 or 5 for places I typically love. Service was bad, my hubs had to get up multiple times to ask for things we needed AND the oxtail wasn't as tender as it should've been. The oxtail meat did not fall off the bone, so in the end a lot of the meat was left on the bone. $16 for a bowl of pho, so it felt pretty wasted since most meat got left behind. I tried to gnaw the meat off, but it just wasn't tender enough to slip off easily. So my husband had to go ask for knife and fork so I could cut some of the meat off. 

The servers never came by to check on us or to see if we needed anything. If so, they would've known that our garnish plates never came out. We sat around trying to remove meat from bone in our soup bowls for 5 minutes and still no garnish plates. I wasn't sure if maybe this pho is so haute that they don't let you add anything to it because it will ruin the flavor somehow. I started to look around and saw plates of sprouts, basil, and lime though on other tables. That's when my husband got up to ask for garnish plates. Also, they don't refill water. Middle of the meal, I had drank a good portion and needed MOAR! Again, my husband had to get up to ask for a water refill. The other time he got up was to ask for the knife to cut meat, because they simply did not come around to ask us if we needed anything. 

Again, amazing flavor in the broth but the meat texture and service could use a lot of improvement. At the price level they're selling, they should really step up their service game. The flavor here is definitely next level, and if you can overlook the price, service, and oxtail texture, you're good to go! I think I will come back though to give them another chance.

I ordered the serrano wings (6 for $7.95) and a side of steam rice ($1.50). The waiter then showed me the specials on a chalkboard -- none of which I was interested in but then I asked what the difference was between the wings on his specials board and the wings that I ordered. He said nothing -- but his price quote was more expensive than the menu he gave me. He really seemed confused and said the price must have dropped. Interesting. Anyway, he then said, what time is it? I said like 3:20, he said oh it's happy hour, there is a happy hour menu. He left, provided it to me, and the wings were $.50 each ($3 for 6), so, then I also decided to order the fried spring rolls ($3.95), and steamed rice. My bill with tip was $11 so, cheap but the food wasn't very good, the wings tasted a bit like chicken liver -- not sure what was happening there. The spring rolls were the highlight but I did not like their sweet chili sauce and asked if they had hot mustard -- they do not. The rice was not quality. It was not sticky, but very separated like American (uncle ben's) rice.

The clincher was -- while I was finishing up. The owner or manager maybe, drove up (Toyota beige truck), parked in the only handicap spot in front (no handicap sign or designation on plate), and walked in the restaurant/pulled up at bar and was still there 20 minutes later when I left. It is totally is rude and annoying when perfectly able body people take the handicap spots (I'm in tuned because my mom is disabled and I drive her around a lot and its annoying that spots are taken by those with no disability and just lazy-asses).",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,0,0,2,5qdJhPrb5OG3H2HjQE7DYg

Occupying the former home of Cravin' Cajun and serving up modern Vietnamese cuisine in a room one part hipster-industrial and one part sports bar it was with a group of five that I sat down at District One Kitchen & Bar just minutes after noon and focusing our order on variety the results proved 'variable' at best.  Clearly untrained and understaffed to handle a restaurant nearly 3/4 full by 12:30 it was with a trio of appetizers that our meal began and with beverage refills scarce as servers ran in circles perhaps it was fortuitous that none of the first round proved remotely spicy, the hamachi tacos bright and crisp at $3 each while dull, limp wings and the vinegar tinged salad proved entirely forgettable...and not particularly 'Vietnamese' at all.  Moving next to larger scale items, a duo of pho dishes would prove respectable if not particularly well presented; the supple oxtail imbuing long rice noodles with a meaty sapor while an enormous proximal femur laced its broth with fat to balance ample scallions, though heat remained mute even in the presence of sliced jalapenos.  Moving finally to the items that showed the kitchen's promise, suffice it to say that tender pork belly first braised then rendered soft in coconut milk proved by far the most complex option of the afternoon despite its unexpected sweetness and although a seemingly odd choice, the throwback 'get down n' dirty' shrimp finally delivered in the spice department, a pound of the snappy shell-ons again leaving my water-glass empty while wondering why we hadn't just gone to Crab Corner or Hot n' Juicy instead.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,2,2,KF-_XI_gWvp6pZ1e1DXTxA

Braised pork belly with sauce, peanuts and cilantro. This was tasty and fatty. 4/5

Soft Shell Crab:
Big pieces of deep-fried soft shell crab with a dipping sauce. 4/5

Lobster Pho:
Here's a dish you won't see at most Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. The broth was quite tasty. They serve the whole lobster with head, claws and tail - the body and claws have been de-shelled so all you have to do is eat and enjoy. Market price for when I went was $32. 4.5/5

Mi Sate:
A big bowl of egg noodles and beef in peanut sauce. It tastes like Filipino kare-kare but much watery and with noodles. 3.5/5

District One Rice Combo Platter:
Short ribs (or you can get pork chop), kimchi, fried egg, Chinese sausage, and rice. A big plate that will not leave you hungry. The short ribs were flavorful and grilled. 4/5

The place seems like a good place to hang out at. The bar looks promising and I was watching the bartender interact with people at the bar during commercials - the people at the bar seemed pleased.

He said the whole restaurant remembered me because of all silliness my friends and I were having and the jokes I was making. My friends and I were calling it PhOlympics and Phoci. We're full of punny! This unusually cool weather in late May and crazy allergies, Pho is what the doctor ordered.

On this visit we ordered Spring Rolls, the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio, and a bowl of the Beef & Flank Pho. I also ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee (which is a poor decision on a Wednesday night at 7 PM, I was so jacked) because when in Rome...

First out was the Beef Carpaccio, which was a little too salty for my taste, but it was tasty nonetheless. A huge portion and I had a lot of fun eating it with chopsticks. It was peanut, garlicky, citrusy goodness, just tone down the salt!

Next up was the Spring Rolls. These were nothing special and were straight to the point. Tasted fresh and the peanut-fish sauce was delicious and fresh.

Next up was the Beef & Flank Pho which was delicious. The broth is perfection, top it with some sprouts, jalapeños, a squeeze of lime, and sprig of mint. I also add a bit of Sriracha because I like the hot, hot, heat! Seriously, savor the rich complexity of the broth. 

At this point we were stuffed and happily fed. We were thanked for dining there and happily on our way. 

District One has a lot of seating, booths and long tables. There's a bar and TVs everywhere. Service is prompt and friendly. Food is fresh and tasty. They also have a bunch of fresh seafood that's delivered daily as well as a Lobster Pho that will happen at the next PhOlympics.

From the huge drink selection, to the flat screen TVs playing sports, to the modern, urban, and industrial decor, it's clear the owners designed this space to be a cool destination to hang out, socialize, drink, and dine. District One Kitchen & Bar is also open until 3am and offers some decent happy hour specials from 3pm-6pm and midnight to 3am.

I recently tried this place with four friends on Friday night at 9pm upon the recommendation of an acquaintance. Besides the limited parking in a crowded parking lot, our only complaint was that our five entrees arrived at four different times -- each of them 3-4 minutes apart. The staff made up for it by being extremely attentive with our drinks, however -- three of us had 3-4 refills each -- and a female manager was very gracious and friendly as we exited the restaurant. The food we ordered was also just as good as advertised. 

The five of us shared the garlic serrano pepper wings, pork belly buns, Vietnamese beef carpaccio, and fish tacos for our appetizers. The beef carpaccio was definitely our favorite and the fish tacos our least favorite (mainly because of the small portion and $8.95 price tag).

I ordered the Crispy Bird Nest Noodles for my entree and the dish was so tasty I didn't offer a bite to anyone in my group. Two of my friends ordered the Steak & Eggs and raved about the flavor of the steak but complained the eggs weren't cooked to their specification.

After a night of heavy partying (""getting lit"" or ""turnt"" as the cool kids like to say these days), I always find pho to be one of the best hangover cures/comfort foods to have the next morning. And this place definitely hits the spot. I ordered the pho tai nam, my standard go-to, and collectively shared an order of their ""big bone soup"" with the rest of my group. The pho tai nam did not disappoint at all. It was very delicious and satisfying. The big bone soup is also a surprise to me. Very tasty large beef bones cooked in their own broth, with delicious tendon hanging off the bone and bone marrow inside. I think they would go great with some of the other more carb-loaded dishes.

Our server was decent, but she seemed pretty busy and didn't check on us as often as we like. They also have a wicked bar selection of amazing Japanese whiskies; too bad I wasn't in the mood to have any alcohol at that point of visit. Maybe next time!

5349195,2016-06-30,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"So I've been here maybe four times? Once was for lunch and the other three times was for dinner. One of the dinners, it was during happy hour so we got to try some of the happy hour items. 

District One has a very modern feel to it. They have a bar at the back, booths in the front, and tables in the middle. Their menu consists of Asian fusion with a few traditional Vietnamese dishes, such as pho and bun bue hue. 

On my most recent visit, I got to try a few things on the happy hour menu. The Serrano pepper wings were pretty good. It was deep fried nice and crispy on the outside yet very juicy on the inside. The flavor of the Serrano pepper doesn't necessarily soak through as much because the peppers were way spicier than the wings, but I suppose that's expected for something that's deep fried. We also got a dozen of their happy hour oysters, which at the time were blue points. I can't say they do their oysters very well because it was dry. There was no brine to accompany it; therefore, you HAVE to squeeze lemon on it AND use cocktail sauce. I typically just eat it with lemon but that was not a choice here. I probably wouldn't get oysters here again. My friends LOVE their Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio but I don't mirror their feelings for the dish. They doused the beef in so much oil that I feel like that's the only thing I can taste! My friends also got their Cajun garlic fries, which had really good flavor. The only problem was that one batch had more garlic flavor than the second batch so the inconsistency surely shines through. 

For their pho, I have tried their oxtail pho and rib eye pho. I must say, District One is possibly my favorite place for pho. It is not the cheapest pho in town but it's got the best flavor to their broth. I didn't care for the oxtail though -- it was just three oxtail bones in there. I'd rather have the oxtail a different way but it was good nonetheless. I've also tried their Mekong River Style Noodle Soup, which was only so-so for me. They put a ton of stuff in there and perhaps some people like that. It's just not my thing though. They filled it with bean sprouts and a ton of meat. I prefer to control the bean sprouts on my own like I do with pho ;P Their garlic noodles, however, were very delicious. It's got good flavor and it's simple. 

Their oxtail fried rice is so popular. It's one of the dishes that you have got to try and, well, I didn't care for it. That was the first thing I tried when I first went to District One and I gotta say, I can't even remember it. I love clay pot rice so I had to try theirs. It's slightly different from the Chinese version because they mixed in the soy sauce for you already into the rice and frankly, they put too much. The dish was a tad too salty for me. I liked how they would put whole cloves of garlic in there though :) 

Their grilled squid is pretty good though. It was very soft and not chewy at all! I'm not a huge fan of squid but I would definitely order it again when I go. 

The service was decent. I wouldn't say that it was amazing service but it wasn't absolute garbage either. 

Overall, I would justify District One with a 3 star rating. Don't get me wrong -- it's not a BAD rating. It's good. But out of allllll the stuff I've tried, only like three dishes stuck out for me: pho, garlic noodles, and grilled squid. I would definitely come back for those three dishes haha!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,2,3,8mOBj4ZEH3Ie1eYupBewXg

I dragged my friends along and we had a meal of epic proportions. 
Oxtail fries were soso, it tasted good but were real soggy. 
Serrano wings were damn good. Who doesnt like crispy wings with a touch of heat that slightly lingers on your palate. 
I had the big bone soup and a bowl of pho on the side. The broths tastes real flavorful. It was a lil effort to get all the meat off the bones but it was so worth it. I ate every tendon and meat strand there was then all the marrow inside them bones. 
My friends got the lobster pho which looked so freaking delicious, ( unfortunately I'm allergic to shellfish) I have learned to live vicariously through others so I was reading his face after each bite and it was of shear delight. 
My cousin got the steak and eggs, which he loved. The rice was tomato rice and the ""steak"" was their shaken beef.  He liked his dish  very much aswell

We decided to give this place another try after a few months. To start we ordered the garlic fries which has fresh crushed garlic and Cajun seasoning. We  ordered the fries well-done extra crispy and they came out soggy I wasn't a fan.  We  ordered the fish tacos which was yellowtail sashimi, Avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomatoes. The tacos were delicious we were  very happy they had a unique wonton taco shell which really made the dish no complaints. Next we ordered the belly buns which was braised pork belly, Cilantro, and peanuts with a typical bun. I was very disappointed with them they need a lot of work, they are average at best. Next we tried the Oxtail  Fried Rice which had Shredded Oxtail meat, red onion, soy sauce and a fried egg. Another disappointment they said it was one of their more popular dishes but failed to deliver amongst our table. Lastly we tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio which consists of beef carpaccio, citrus soy, sesame oil, truffle oil, white onions, basil and peanuts. This was very good, nothing that I would completely rave  about but very good. No complaints I would order it and the tacos again for sure.
Pros: Good food, cool atmosphere, good crowd and they're open late.
Cons: although some of the dishes are good the rest of menu definitely needs some work. They really could be doing better. The staff seemed a little distracted with each other talking and on their phones at times and not really paying attention to a lot of the tables my friends and I had to wait a few times for water and drinks. After ordering appetizers our waiter disappeared for at least 15 minutes before he came back to take our entrée order. Lastly no wifi this is always a bother considering it's 2017 and every business should offer it to their patrons.
We are leaving disappointed for a second time which is very frustrating.
This place has so much potential and they keep dropping the ball. If they step their game up and improve the menu and food quality we would go all the time. As of now they have two strikes against them and I don't want there to be a third. We will give them another chance in a month or so and we will see.

Winnahz! Next on the oxtail bandwagon, Oxtail Fried Rice, Oxtail Fries, and of course, their Oxtail Pho! So go on and get yours! Must try! ALL! And while you're at it, and speaking of pho again...LOBSTER PHO! Whatttttthaaaapho??? This dish is an absolute memorable dish! A chef has done his job when a patron says his dish is ""memorable!"" That's their lobster pho! Last, but certainly not least, we had their Big Bone Soup! Massive! Inexplicably, massive! We were at odds trying to figure out how to dig into this dish! Thankfully, our ""looks like from Hawaii, but not from Hawaii"" server offered to carve it up table-side for us. The marrow. The soup. TO DIE FOR!

Oh, and yes, we mustn't forget the bar. Their cocktails (coconut mojito served in a coconut...mmm!) and beer selections are awesome! And there are TVs everywhere you sit so that you can never miss a game!

THANK YOU, KHAI & DISTRICT ONE! Your place rocks! And it's ""traditional Vietnamese mother - approved!""",xozBOvi6cWO_p1OdteF9zw,1,2,5,p6voTSGn_IJ-Lygjf0yz-Q

We thought they were busy, so we waited patiently, but when we saw the table next to ours came in way after us already received their food, we asked our waiter and ended up they never put our order into the system. 

Instead of letting us cancelling the order, they just went ahead and put in the order and told us the food was already in the making. 
So we had to take it to go. 

They were trying to make it up for us by giving us one of the dishes for free, guess what, instead of the happy hour price, they charged us full price, because by the time they put in the order into the system( an hour later) it was already 7:06pm(happy hour 4-7)
So we ended up paying more.... 

I'm glad it happened to me thought, because I'm a hospitality business owner, can't imagine if I recommend my guests to come here and experience the same shitty treatment.

I heard great things about District One from my roommate who recommended their pho and carpaccio. I didn't know about carpaccio at a non-Italian restaurant, so we passed on that, but we got a side of egg rolls and shared a ox bone soup with a side of extra noodles. A pho + side of noodles is plenty enough food for two! My only disappointment was that I expected the soup broth to be milkier since it was ""ox bone"" soup (I'm familiar with this type of soup being boiled for hoursssss), but it just felt like regular pho soup with boiled ox bone meat put into the soup. The meat wasn't melting off the bone like I expected it to, but still a great serving of pho nonetheless.

It might be on the pricey side but it was definitely worth the experience.

I had the Steak and Eggs which is basically Bò lúc lc and I gotta say it was great. The steak was tender, juicy and had that similar taste of A1 sauce while the fried rice complimented the beef really well. It balanced out the rich taste of the sauce. The portion size was comparable to the price.

We ordered the oxtail fries, lemon grass beef, fried whole fish, the big bone soup, spicy hue noodle soup, pho oxtail, and garlic noodles. It was a table full and it all looked and was very delicious.

The oxtail fries came out crispy, smothered in shredded oxtail 'gravy' and of coarse the fried egg, the fries stayed crispy for the most part and the meat/gravy was well saturated with pieces of meat, soft and tender. 

Lemon grass beef came out as little bundles of meat wrapped  with betel leaves. This dish was just blah, cannot say much about it. 

The fried whole fish was a beautiful dish, the fish was rather large and had a good deal of meat, two at the table really enjoyed picking the bones clean, even feasting on the fish eyes. 

The spicy hue noodle soup had just enough spice to make my lips numb but wasn't too overwhelming. And the big bone soup had the biggest pieces.

Lobster Fried Rice - Huge chunks of lobster with claws and shell as decorative display. Flavor was ok and not the best fried rice or lobster I had especially for the price but the the presentation was done well.

The Big Bone Soup - Shit looks like something a caveman would eat. Not the most flavorful and some may find this shit intimidating with this pre-historic looking ass dish. We kept the bones for the lil homies back home.

They have friendly servers, dope atmosphere and cool decor but what really does it is the food. Man I can eat here every day. 

They have traditional vietnamese dishes, like pho and BBH.

Oxtail everything is good and they have good oxtail. But what really kills the game is their specials. Where else can you get lobster pho? Nowhere. At least not till they brought it. They always have fresh seafood specials like oysters, crab, and crawfish. I've eaten basically everything. I could keep going on and on but better to let you try it for yourself.

Lobster garlic noodle. Their version of it is so bomb. 
Black pepper lobster. I'm a fan of black pepper already but with lobster?????

The spring rolls were also surprisingly fresh. They put mint leaves in there, but it wasn't overbearing. Just gave it a nice refreshing kick. Also they fried a piece of egg roll or wonton skin and rolled it up in the spring roll, so it also gave it a nice crunch. Loved this! 

The fish tacos were a miss. Yellowtail sashimi with guacamole, tomatoes. I generally like the taste of sashimi and don't need it doled up with a lot of flavors. But even the flavors they added just covered up whatever flavor the fish had, and the whole thing was just lacking in flavor. Maybe put more like lime in it, or sweet pickled onions. 

Pho was good - flavorful broth, good amoun of beef, and noodles cooked well. 

Viet iced coffee - delicious!!! 

The service was friendly, and prompt. I loved the decor of the restaurant too - kind of like a hip bar, where you can watch sports (lots of tvs), and beer and alcoholic beverages.

One of them was when I got stuck in the currents and couldn't swim out while scuba diving 30m deep in the ocean. 

Two was the free falling moment from skydiving over the island of Oahu. 

Three was discovering the loster phõ and oxtail fried rice from district One in Vegas. 

One of my favourite to go to food is phõ so naturally it's in the basket. I also like seafood so when I saw a whole lobster in my bowl of phõ it was a happy moment for me. 

The presentation was amazing but moving past that the flavor of the broth was superb . It was rich, aromatic and the noodle was perfectly cooked to my liking. 

Oxtail was something I'm familiar with however not cooked in the fried rice format. I thought it would be bland and just like regular fried rice. I was utterly wrong. The dish was perfect. The rice wasn't too dry or moist, the portion of oxtail was very generous.

District One was the only thing I ate that day, and honestly, I didn't know what happened to me. But starting at 8:00pm on Friday, 6/16, I started to feel very, very sluggish. I was playing in a poker tournament and I just could not keep my head up in the game. I was very light-headed and had to put my head down many times. Little did I know that it was the beginning to a disaster. I busted from the tournament that I no longer cared for and went straight to my room.

The next day, I start getting cold chills, body aches, high fever, and many trips to the bathroom that was just complete diarrhea every time, and it was awful. I lost my appetite, I was weak, and I didn't know what was going on. It wasn't until I texted my friend who came with me to District One, that he was experiencing the SAME THING. Fortunately for him, his only lasted 2 days. Said he took Pepto Bismol and sat on the toilet for 2 hours. I, took everything imaginably possible because I was getting desperate. I took Pepto, charcoal pills, ibuprofen, tylenol, many over priced juices, gatorade, drinking plenty of water, and NOTHING was working. My friend probably spent nearly $100 on all the items he had to get for me.

3rd day, Sunday 6/18, I felt like I was dying. Thankfully my friend stayed with me in the hotel at the Venetian on Saturday night to make sure I was okay, but this day was the WORST. My friend went to go have lunch with his other friend while I stayed in the room all day. Of course I woke up early at 8am to take my ritual diarrhea (this was about my 10th trip to the bathroom in the past 3 days) The minutes seemed to last forever, and when I looked at my watch to notice it was only 11am after what felt like hours on end, I didn't know what to do. My body aches and body chills were getting WORSE. My fever in my head just kept getting higher and higher, to the point where I thought my head was going to explode. My bed was soaked because of the cold sweat I had all night. I was too weak to open up the cap for the Tylenol that I bought, so I was stuck. I told my friend to cut his lunch early to take me to the ER. We had to call numerous places since there was such limited availability on a Sunday but we finally found a spot 20 mins away. We went there and thankfully my gf is a doctor and I told her my symptoms and asked her if it was a good idea, since I was about to walk in. I didn't feel like spending an additional $1200+ for the emergency room fee so she just told me to just go through it and not check in to the ER. I was also feeling a little better getting to move around and go outside so that helped as well. 

4th Day, Monday 6/19, I start to feel much better and my poop starts solidifying (sorry for all the gruesome details but it was really that bad). I finally had my first real meal at dinner and by Tuesday, 6/20, I was better. 

District One, you wasted 4 days of my Vegas trip because of your Oxtail Pho. 4 of us ordered Oxtail Pho, and the first two bowls you gave out to my other two friends were fine. The next batch of bowls that came out that came to my friend and me was the really bad batch. We both got food poisoning but thankfully his only lasted 1.5-2 days while mine lasted nearly 4 days. You also made me spend ridiculous amounts of money on over-the-counter items and supplies and I couldn't even focus in the poker tournament that I spent $1500 to enter that I was looking forward to the most the entire year. Thank you for ruining part of my Vegas Trip. This was probably my most expensive lunch I've ever had.

Also, I felt really, really bad for the other people who had the bad batch of Oxtail Pho that day. It was the first day of EDC weekend and I can't imagine what they were going through in the middle of the dessert after getting food poisoning as well. They probably thought it was the heat and the music or drugs getting to them, when really, it was the lunch they ate earlier that day.",QswyyvjF3F_fbosPDp3EdQ,1,0,1,tGSyqYRN--nccxlVQZOEJQ

Everything was spot-on amayyyzing, and the fried rice was definitely one of the best I have ever had. The service was especially great as we the waiters were always ready to come whenever we group needed more water, wanted more food in the menu, or needed the bill. Very professional.

However the second time, not so much. We came during the night this time, so I do admit that it was fairly busy. When we were seated it took quite a while for a waiter to come and receive our order, and after that, it took 22 minutes before we were served our water (yes I counted). We were already dying of hunger, and then they could not quench us of our thirst!! I believe that every restaurant should not make this costly mistake of forgetting to serve the customer water. I had to remind the staff that they forgot it.

On the bright side, the oxtail fried rice was still awesome as ever, but for the blunder made earlier, I am only giving this place 4 stars.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,5,4,4,E548e1wO1PWMaiYbuUyxvw

I was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   

Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. 

The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.

After aimlessly driving in the rain to find out my destination was closed, I found myself checking nearby restaurants on, you guessed it, the Yelp app when District One popped up.  Long bookmarked but not previously sampled I pulled a u turn and made a very good food decision.  

First off, I have never felt so welcome in a restaurant.  First the hostess greated me and proceeded to ask how I was doing before explaining the concept of Asian Fusion.  She escorted me to the bar where I had a personal flat screen and she told me to ask if I wanted to change channels.  The bartender Adrian (sp?) was also amazing.  She took time taking my order, was way more knowledgeable about the menu than most bartenders need to be and was happy to explain the options.  She recommended the oxtail fried rice and the fish taco appetizer.  She even discouraged me from ordering additional food items as the rice was a large portion instead of letting me waste my money. I was also impressed that she asked about food allergies.

The fish tacos arrived three small wonton tacos with what can only be described as a light and crisp cerviche.  The flavor was amazing and it was the perfect appetizer as it was not too filling but really pleased the taste buds.

The oxtail fried rice came with a fried egg on top.  At Adrian's recommendation I got mine runny which really helped the flavor spread through the rice.  The rice itself had a large portion of oxtail mixed in and a great mix of flavors.  

I wanted to lick my plate clean when finished the flavors were so good.  However, she was right and I was full, so glad I didn't order any other dishes.

I highly recommend this place.  For those of us who budget, the rice was $12.99, and the entire meal, with a beer came to $30.00.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,16,15,5,dB79TuyEtJ0mgKN4CIz5_g
5585755,2014-02-08,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Our party tried three appetizers and three entrees. We started with the Vietnamese Eggrolls, Fish Tacos, and Pork Belly Buns. These were all great tasting and beautifully prepared. The eggrolls were made with taro which gave it a unique taste. The fish tacos were our favorite. Although on the pricier side (approx. $10 for three baby tacos), the fish was fresh and tasted awesome with all its taco components. Pork belly was tender. Highly recommend.

Entrees were Mi Sate, Oxtail Pho, and Steak & Eggs.

Mi Sate was OK. We all agreed it was our least favorite dish. Very super thick, peanut flavored sauce-like broth with skinny egg noodles. There is a small spicy kick, but I couldn't get over the peanut butter thickness. Maybe it just had a bad night?

The real hero of the night was the Oxtail Pho. Leave it to District One to bring this one all the way home. Very aromatic, tender (and plentiful servings of) oxtail, a truly original tasting broth. Steak & Eggs was a good decision too. Steak was tender and expertly cooked, tomato rice was flavorful, overall good decision for anyone. 

Impeccable guest service. We were diligently waited on by an attentive team and the food came out in a timely manner.

Overall good food, good ambiance. I will return with friends. Next time I'd really like to try their crawfish, lobster pho, 5 spice roasted hen, clay pot pork belly, and ca phe sua da! Awesome first impression! See you again, District one!",7k7rF6voco_FhjRKVEeg2g,5,4,4,SCaMe5uTtAjVpNu-tWtpOQ
5588912,2014-01-27,2,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"So here I am, at the soft opening of this new restaurant in town called District One. I'm here with 6 friends, so I didn't actually order ALL this food. 

Decor: Love this Asian fusion restaurant. The decor is so cute. Especialy love the wallpaper and the ""let's nhau"" quote (vietnamese for let's party/drink) in the corner of the room. There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.

The CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.

Appetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.

Entree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.

Overall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool. It definitely feels like a family friendly environment. The waiters and waitresses come around and they always ask if everything is okay, and ready for refills.

5593937,2016-08-17,1,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"Had some really good food at this asian fusion (heavy on the Vietnamese) gastropub of sorts on Jones Blvd.   Some Vegas locals took me here for a late lunch and I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. I had heard good things about District One so it was great to finally go there the last time I was in town.

We started off with the oxtail fries ($11.99) which we topped with an over easy egg. The fries were crunchy, the oxtail was tender and delicious in its own gravy. I really liked this dish and recommend that you get it. It was really good. Next we had the beef carpaccio ($12.99). It was excellent. My favorite version of beef carpaccio so far. It was perfectly thin ribeye with sesame and citrus flavors. It was just so very good. Ordering this next time for sure. Next were the pork belly buns (3 for $7.99). They were good with the peanut sauce and the braised pork belly was soft and tender. I could have done without the cilantro but that was just standard on the order. Good dish. We also had the oxtail fried rice ($12.99). SO GOOD. So flavorful... You have to order it. Shredded oxtail with all kinds of delicious seasoning with another over easy egg as a topping. Only thing I would change on this dish is add more oxtail for sure. The pics I took doesnt show too much oxtail in it and it could have used some more. Lastly we had the beef and lemongrass wrapped in betel leaves ($7.99). This was my least favorite of all the dishes we had. The lemongrass flavor was too strong IMO. The beef was tender and there were other seasoning flavors I couldnt make out. I would pass on that next time. 

Service was very good. Jeff was excellent. Very personable guy and we appreciated his attentiveness to our party. Kudos to him... Cant wait to eat at District One the next time I'm in town. Heard that whole fried fish dish is the one!

Yet, after checking out the reviews and pictures on Yelp, I couldn't resist but to see what all the hubbub was about.  

The dining set up is generally the same with minor accented tweaks here and there.  I was lured to this place initially because it didn't look like they took their ""V"" grade, turned it upside down and drew a line threw it for a fictitious ""A"" grade, unlike other Louisiana style seafood dumps.  Problem is, ""the mob is fickled,"" and sad to say people sometimes are quick to jump on the bandwagon.  But enough about the old joint, it is obvious the new owners wanted to create their own niche.

Nevertheless, the hip doctor undoubtedly paid a visit to this place and modernized it with an industrial/urbanish twist with the decor, ambiance and music genre playlist.  Even much of the old staff is still here, although, I bird told me that the new owners include those from Pho Kim Long amongst other unknown benefactors.

I was hungry and was recommended to try the Mi Sate, as it looked quite filling considering that it is primarily peanut butter based.  It was sort of like Mi Quang, Kare Kare and sate stew had menage, producing a love child of savory goodness.  I added the grape leaf wrapped beef appetizers to switch things up as well.

I gotta say, the dishes are unique, bold and a nice eccentric version on Vietnamese cuisine that is practically absent through the entire city and I only hope for their success.  

Best of all, Vy, who looks to be one of the head honcho-ess (?), gave word that they will be offering Nikka, Hibiki and Yamazaki Japanese whiskey along with other unique refreshments.  It is now a must that I come back with like minds.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,15,9,4,JgiLTqZAMuVYOJG5aCCYcg

Pho Tai Bo Vien is my go-to order at any pho restaurant. Paying a total of ~$12 for a bowl compared to $6 from SD is just not what I'm used to. It was $3 extra for tai (rare steak). But granted they do give you a TON of meat. The rare steak is cut thicker than most traditional pho places that clumps into balls when left in the soup broth for too long.

On my first visit, my party came in to specifically try their pandan creme brûlée which we did not end up getting because it was too early in the morning for dessert and we got full off of all the other items we ordered.  We ordered the spring rolls, fish tacos, belly buns, chicken wings, and oxtail pho.  We originally had our eyes on the lobster pho, however, being that it was forth of July weekend they were out at the moment. 

The spring rolls and chicken wings were very traditional to the Vietnamese root.  However, the fish tacos and belly buns definitely have the Asian fusion flare to it.  The fish tacos came in three and was made with yellowtail (my all time favorite fish).  It was tasty and nice to look at.  The belly buns are a bit greasy, but then again it is made with pork belly.  It had a nice peanut butter taste and the buns were really good.  As for the oxtail pho, we were all surprised that it smelt and tasted great.  Sorry, but not sorry, Vegas is not known for their pho.  This one, however, had all the right flavors.

On our second visit, we went big and ordered a round of lobster pho.  It was pricey, but so very worth it.  I never had lobster pho before and now I never want to go without it.  Seriously, the food here is phenomenal.  Also, staff are super friendly and attentive.  Decor of the place is very modern, but the best part is their sinks.  I know it is crazy, however, they have sinks outside the restrooms.

I really hoped to like this place but I felt the food was hit or miss.  The service was average with a few instances where we were unable to find someone to help us.

But really, the food was sort of a disappointment given the price tags.  So here's the rundown:
- Snails:  The price on these were ""MP"".  I believe they were $14 that day.  We got a small bowl of anemic snails (6) in a lemongrass broth.  The broth was good.  The snails were not my cup o'tea.
- Black Pepper Lobster:  MP...Good flavor, waaayyyy too salty and oversauced.  The noodles underneath also became too salty. Lobster must have also been dieting.
- Shrimp Skewers: Also MP...they were just regular big shrimp. Unfortunately, these came a skosh overcooked.
- Oxtail fried rice:  Probably my favorite dish that evening, especially since they left in all the tender fat and gristle from the oxtail itself.
- Oxtail fries:  Nicely done fries, topping was also great.
- Garlic Chicken Wings:  You got the garlic but it was sorely unsalted.
- Cornish Hen - Bird itself was moist and well-seasoned; accompanying rice was meh
- Calamari - Forgettable except for the spicy sauce that came with it.
- Rib Eye Pho - Average

Cocktails were pretty tasty but nothing revolutionary or out of this world.

All in all, a decent meal but a little on the pricey side for what you get.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,3,3,3,XZFVspTW3LYhHLsDBETt4A

Unfortunately, the pho is very blan and overpriced. It was more so salty than anything, as if the salt was trying to compensate for the lack of flavor. 

The oxtail in the pho was tough and difficult to eat: oxtail meat is supposed to fall of the bone!

The standout items here isn't  what you expect it to be. The garlic noodles was delicious. If you are a fan of garlic, you would LOVE as it packs a nice garlic punch. The oxtail fries was also good: the oxtail in the fries was a decent portion and was tender and marinated in a flavorful sauce.  The oxtail fried rice, was was also good, but a little on the greasy side and not really special: it did have some bits of oxtail but other than that, not overly special.

My favorite would have to be the oxtail fries. The fries are covered in an oxtail gravy and an egg perfectly cooked sunny side up. Cut into the yoke and let it run down all over the gravy and fries! It is a unique dish that any fry lover won't be able to stop eating. 

This place does offer a lobster pho bowl. The bowl is large and is sold at Market Price. That day it was a $35 bowl. The broth is pretty good. I'm not sure I would pay $35 again for a 2nd bowl. Hey, you're there for the first time, might as well right?

A definite must is the pandan creme brûlée. Like most Asian desserts, it is just slightly sweet and not overpowering your sweet tooth. This hit the spot. Do not skip this.

The decor upon entering is nicely done in rustic and metal undertones. The fonts and quotes on the wall gives it a urban/chic feel. 
Now to the food. The menu is pretty creative with all of my favorite classics with a twist. Asian fusion at its finest. Such as the Ox tail Pho or Lobster pho or fried rice. I usually order the Ox tail Pho. The broth is rich and savory with a hint of sweetness kissed by my hoisin and Sriracha. 
The pork buns with is pork belly on an Asian bun never disappoints. You can get it regular or deep fried! If you're from the South like me, deep fried is a no-brainer!
They also have razor clams when it's in season! It is  paradise in your mouth! 
I can go on and on about the food...but what they do they do well. Their menu showcases everything you want in an Asian Fusion dish. A bit of influences everywhere. 
The service is attentive. The staff even recognizing me although I am not a local. It makes you feel like this place is home!

So it is great to find a cool ASIAN bar where you can actually watch games!  And they come with great food, which is double great!  $20 pitcher of Heineken is a bit steep, but it does fill up about 6 tall glasses and it comes in those pitchers with built in ice cooler.  Miller Lites are $15 for the pitcher, if you're looking for better bargains.  The food is more Vietnamese fusion than diverse Asian, but no matter, it's still good stuff.  We had a few dishes:  Ox Tail Pho, Garlic Serrano Pepper Wings, Beef Lemongrass skewers, and Calamari.  The pho was fantastic, calamari was great, and wings and skewers were good but not great.  The meatiness of the ox tail and the light & crispy batter on the calamari stood out.  There are other interesting dishes we want to try out, which will have to wait for the next time.

The real winner that is a great accompaniment to the good food is the atmosphere.  Wait staff was great for the most part, and like a typical Asian restaurant they don't have ""designated"" sections for each server so you can flag anybody down for what you need.  They're very good about coming around and waiting on your table, and many of them were even social with the customers in a pleasant and non-intrusive way.  Big ups for the wait staff.  There are TVs all around every section of the place, so wherever you sit you will have multiple views of the action.  Wish the TVs were a bit bigger though, although they were close enough that it wasn't a bother.

Great atmosphere, great wait staff (including the super cutie that appeared to be the hostess/manager?), and great food all make for a great ""bar"" that deserves at least 4.5 stars.  Oh, the tab came to $150 before tips for the 4 of us, but I suppose when you order 4 $20 pitchers... but the price is a bit steeper than your typical Vietnamese.

Table-for-1 Factor:  I'm not seeing this place as a great atmosphere for sitting alone (might be awkward), but there is a bar with good 8-10 bar stools if you have the inkling.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,2,0,5,UtliNHh2j-dePFlrshd_Mg

This place is cool, hip and a joint I would want to hang out at with my friends. However, I am less impressed with the food. Pho is very lacking in flavor, portions of appetizers are really small and prices are higher end compared to other Viet restaurants. I was most dissapointed by the hamachi tacos. 3 of the tiniest tacos the size of a pinky finger and literally a teaspoon of fish in each for over $10. I also ordered the oxtail fries. It had an interesting flavor with Viet spices that were very pronounced. It was ok but the 6+ chunks of gelatinous fat really grossed us out. These pieces were about 2×2"" of pure fat! I think they were trying to pay homage to the oxtail fries at Bachi but really fell short. Wings are always good and the steak and egg platter was as well.

This place is like a Vietnamese infusion because they have traditional Vietnamese food but some dishes have a nice twist to it. I ordered almost all of their seafood dishes (I was on a seafood crave that day) and it was all great. Their snails were huge and the broth that it came in was sooo good. Their clams, oysters, calamari, pho, everything was just delicious. There wasn't anything here that I did not like.

Am I the only one who is reminded of the Hunger Games because of this restaurant's name?

Let's start off with the appearance of this place. Let's just put it simply.. I feel pretty freakin' cool eating here. I definitely wouldn't mind having a photoshoot against their wall of typography. You'll know what I'm referring to once you go here. Look for the words: WTF (Where's The Food) pretty clever.

Let's move onto the menu. They keep everything pretty simple on a clip board and one sheet of paper. Yes, you read correctly... One. Sheet. Each order is pretty much broken down on the menu. They also have specials, so be sure to ask your server on that.

I ordered the steak and eggs both times. What can I say? If I like something, I really like something. The best part of this entree is the steak! It is seriously COOKED TO PERFECTION and even already cut into perfect bite sizes =') They give you a good portion size of rice and an egg on top. I'm seriously still in awe over how amazing their steak is. My boyfriend got their oxtail fried rice, which I found pretty darn tasty. My friend gets their garlic noodles. Who knew that garlic noodles could be so FLAVORFUL?!

The hubby and I have been here a handful of times. My favorite dishes would have to be the bun bo hue, pho ox tail, and shaken beef salad.

We've also had their pork belly buns, crispy egg rolls, and garlic serano pepper wings. All were extremely tasty.

I came in around 3:10 PM and I was excited they have the special lobster fried rice and also their bone in ribeye special. I waited almost 35 mins for my meal to come out I guess they got some amateur cooks back there or some sou chefs making the food. I ordered the following it's a big disappointment I don't want to do a review on it but Yelpers must know.

Server 3/5 server was apologetic and seemed friendly at first but I think she got annoyed with me because I waited for almost 35 mins for my bland food.

Lobster fried rice with cavier 2/5 for almost $50 alone this has to be top five worst fried rice I've ever had because it was oily and seemed like they use oil for frying some kind of meats or something when cooking my fried rice. 

Bone in Ribeye 2/5 asked for Med Well and some of the parts came out Med cook and it was so bland and flavorless it makes Dennys ribeye mouth watering. 

Garlic fries 3/5 nothing special some sautéed garlic with regular fries.

Anyways District one is a fushion Vietnamese restaurant which the real Vietnamese taste and Unami is not there. I got comp for the ribeye the manager does not want to come over and asked how was things becuase she was too busy doing nothing but chatting with another male customer. Put all things aside TK the server or one of the owners was nice and apologize for my bad experience but it won't have me coming anytime in the future.",4EFxo9eO04hOHuPDF7d43Q,0,0,2,UXadXYhzKQKasQxTt0W7Xg

I really wanted to try the beef bone soup. However, they were out of it by the time we arrived. According to our server, there were a lot of people who stopped by for Sunday lunch.

The fresh fish is charged per pound ($23.00 for our 1 1/4 pound of fish). The snapper we ordered was cooked with a delicious sweet and sour sauce service with white rice.

The calamari was a great sharing size. It comes with a mild spicy mayo sauce. The batter tasted a little heavier compared to other calamari I have tried. Still tasty!

The shrimp pho was fantastic and served in a good amount.

- Big Bone Soup - $15 (4/5) - Strait up #foodporn since you get this huuuuge crazy looking bowl full of marrow bones in this pho type broth.

- Viet-chelada! -  Easy to drink, they use a Vietnamese lager instead.
- Beef carpaccio with citrus soy, truffle and sesame oil, and peanut. $13 - solid. 
- Garlic noodles - solid rendition, Thanh Long/Crustacean is still the best tho. 
- Oxtail fried rice - $13 (4/5) - a decent amount of parted oxtail. 

Good
- Chicken wings with the garlic and serrano peppers. $8. Always a hit
- Belly buns $8 - pork belly bao's with jalapeno, cilantro, and peanut. Classic combo, they could get a little creative here and borrow from the Chairman Bao truck. 
- Grilled whole squid - huge. 
- Five spice roasted cornish game hen $13 - overcooked and little skimpy with meat. 
- Hue style beef noodle soup $10 - cha, pork blood cubes, the broth wasn't as deep as I've had. More fusion style.

Their selection is service is great and after visiting for the first time (drive by) with my husband, I ended up bringing a group of friends yesterday for lunch. As I was given credit for picking a great restaurant, I can honestly say I would continue to bring people over, especially the oyster lovers!

Pho is great, specials are GREAT (my husband had the red snapper with papaya salad, which was beautiful presented and great tasting), but I'm a sucker for fresh oysters and both visits, I had 2 dozen of their oysters as my entrée. They server Blue Point as their house special and I enjoyed the Fanny Bays. Topped with tobiko and done just right! 

Wonderful selection of drinks too. I definitely enjoyed Yamazaki which are quite hard to find at any restaurant. I only wish they had Hitachino Red Rice stocked yesterday. 

Nicole coincidentally was our server both times and she was not only helpful but was knowledgeable with both food and drink menus and couldn't have made our experience any better. Our table of 6 was bused frequently was checked up on several times. However another server who came over to check on us informing she will be taking over the section when I asked for our server so we could order additional items. This is when I ordered the Hitachino Red Rice and after she took the order she came back letting me know they were out. I asked what other ones they have as I was naming off the other types as she couldn't remember which one and brought us a drink menu (finds out it was IPA). I totally understand any restaurant will have certain items low/out but would be lovely if the servers could check the 86 list prior to greeting their guests. Not to mention, Nicole never informed us that Juliet will be taking over. However, she did have a very lovely attitude with a beautiful smile and I'd love to have her as our server one of these days! Long story short, everything was great! I am looking forward to trying your black pepper lobster. You will be seeing me again very soon!!

We got the squid, fish tacos, pho filet mignon, oxtail pho, and pork belly. The only thing that was worth it was the fish tacos. Everything else was kind of blah and not worth the price. The service was also very slow. Our waitress was friendly, but the food took forever to come out. All the tables around us got their food faster than us. Some of our food actually came lukewarm, but we got so hungry from waiting that we didn't care. Don't think we'll be coming back.",wnxDuv0Yhf6UdCAY8JTe0A,0,0,3,ycCE4zWwS3GsK7NJGX_DNA

Their claim to fame is here is the lobster pho ($33 mkt price today) which of course I did not order!

Fish Sauce  Hot Wings 5*. 
For those of you who do not know, this is the business. I know it sounds strange but the fish sauce glaze was very well put together and gave the wings a subtle salty flavor. 

Oxtail Loco Moco 3*
This dish was very deceiving as it was not a true loco moco. I was expecting the hamburger patty smothered in the oxtail gravy and topped with an egg. Instead, all I got was oxtail gravy and an egg. So basically it was just gravy rice topped with an egg.  

Oxtail fries 4* 
I like their rendition of the oxtail fries. It was generous serving. the gravy was loaded with the  oxtail meat and not just essence of oxtail like those other guys (bachi)

Spring Rolls 4*
These were your standard fair spring rolls. They were served the real way with leafy lettuce to wrap them up and eat with. On point!

Vietnamese Carpaccio 3*
This was a very cool and different take on traditional carpaccio. It was like eating the raw beef steak that comes with pho.  .    

Birdnest Noodles 3*
This was the ""safe"" dish that we ordered. Nothing wow about this one. It was Hong Kong style crispy noodles topped with veggies, meat and gravy. This is my favorite type of noodle dish hands down so it was a win for me.

  
I enjoyed all of the food that we ordered and think that we got a good sample of what this place is all about! I give this place credit in the creativity and skill in creating these dishes. Vietnamese food is very strong in flavor and can often be overpowering for the novice eater. This place is a good starter for those who aren't familiar with Vietnamese food but want to give it a try. For those of us who grew up on these flavors this place is a breath of fresh air from the traditional...

5930038,2018-06-18,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,Was excited to try this place after watching buzzfeed and it sadly did not live up to the hype. I ordered the oxtail pho and the bf got the lobster pho. Both soups were extremely salty for my liking (so salty it made ME salty). Go ahead and call me extra but I had to add water... we waited pretty long for both soups too and they didn't even come together at the same time. We came around 3 pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all. I got mine first and the bf waited an extra ten mins. Both pho had barely any noodles. I purposely didn't order a starter because I assumed I'd be getting a decent amount of noodles. I also ordered a matcha Thai tea because the tap water tasted nasty too. That also didn't impress me.

The atmosphere is kinda like a crawfish joint.. has a bar.. has nice booth seatings.. The service was not bad as well. the parking is a PAIN in the butt tho... its always so busy in that shopping center so you literally have to circle around a bunch to shark for a parking spot. 

So lets talk about the food.. One of the first things i ordered was the pork belly buns.. it was tasty but nothing mind blowing or nothing. priced at $10. 
I ordered the coconut pork belly with boiled egg as my entree. Theres 3 big chunks of the meat  and an egg. The pork belly was tasty but I would prefer it to  be more tender! its on the chewy side. As a vietnamese person with having it made in my household.. its usually cut more on the smaller side and more tender! its priced at $13. It comes with a small bowl of rice and some pickled cabbage. 
I also ordered the papaya salad with shrimp. its priced at $12. Its BARELY SPICY.... so if you're used to the thai style made papaya salad this is not anything like it. its ok tasting but not what I had expected. I had them adjusted it to more spicy.. which was okay i suppose but not what Im used to. kinda disappointed in this dish. I would say PASS on this dish. 
my friend ordered the creme brûlée i believe and it was mediocre ..nothing that wows me. I had a taste of it ...but glad i didn't order it. 

Overall I would say this place is okay in food but needs lots of improvements ...service is okay as well.. ambiance is alright. I would not bend over backwards to come here.. Im not too sure if i wanna come here in the future.. probably not. I'm just not wowed by this place... pricing is kinda high and food isn't amazing.",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,0,0,3,l3MrZy29e9IB4jdczng-Xg

I had to pay extra for a tiny portion of noodles that took 30 minutes to arrive at the table. My boyfriend order the grilled king crab at MP. He received one leg cut up in 5 pieces for $36. So not worth the money. It was overcooked and rubbery and left him hungry. He order a side of garlic noodles because the crab comes a la carte. He said they tasted good but cold by the time he got them. The staff ignored the table for most of the time. For a party of 8 it took an hour to bring our dishes one at a time. Some of the people were done eating by the time the last dish came to the table. Entree dishes were brought as appetizers and were cold by the time the actual entrees came out.  Just poor kitchen management. The only thing the table enjoyed was the coconut ice cream in the coconut shell. I won't be returning or recommending this place.

There was still a wait around 11pm, but luckily we went right to the bar. The bartender was really nice and chatty, and they had a pretty good alcohol selection (sake flight yay!) The lobster pho was a whopping $50, which for that price I could get over 5 bowls of combo pho, so I had to skip. However, we still splurged and got:

Oxtail pho: The broth was very flavorful, and had definitely been simmering for hours to get that type of flavor. They put a good amount of lime in there when I got it, though I think I like the broth without the lime (or less?) There was a good amount of oxtail, though just a tiny bit of pho noodles. Comparing this to actual pho joints, you're really not going to enjoy the pho noodles, as there really isn't much, but definitely savor all that oxtail.

Bone marrow soup: At first I was thinking, ""nah, it's just a big ol' bone and soup!"" But no! There was plenty of meat still clinging to the bone, and the broth was ultra flavorful and yummy--it was the same as my oxtail pho broth, but without the lime. My husband was so happy to get this dish, as his tummy had not been feeling well and what better than a giant bowl of bone broth? This is definitely something I would get again.

Overall, we both left satisfied and full from all the yummy broth and goodies. I would definitely come again to try the non-broth dishes, but man, that bone marrow is just so tempting.

Atmosphere was trendy, customers young, wait staff attentive.
We ordered the The Big Bone Soup...Chicken Wings....Spring Rolls....Slow Braised Pork Bellies....2 dozen fresh oysters...and Ox Tail Fried Rice.

Definite hints of Vietnamese Fusion in their one page menu.
Perfect menu before you go clubbing, raving, or whatever.

I focused my attention on the Big Bone Soup. 
Bone marrow galore....I felt primitive but happy as I gnawed on the bones like Scooby-Doo!

The Chicken Wings were inhaled by the son....so no reviews.

The spring rolls were great once I wrapped them up in the green veggie leaf, along with fresh green herbs...then dipped in the sweet chili sauce....delish.

The braised pork was delicious.....just take an extra Lipitor afterwards.

The 2 dozen oysters were inhaled by the son.....so no reviews.

Finally, the ox tail fried rice was delish....meaty....goes great with the bone soup.

5947291,2014-10-25,0,Ec9CBmL3285XkeHaNp-bSQ,"I saw this place on my cousin's Instagram so I bookmarked it to try the next time I was in Vegas.

The first time I went was in September with my family. We ordered the: oxtail pho, oxtail fried rice, big bone marrow soup. Everything we ordered were delicious! My mom is difficult to please because either she thinks she can make it better or the food was too expensive but this is the first time she did not complain despite the fact that a bowl of oxtail pho is $11.95! (She was so happy that she took a business card) Her reasoning is that the bowl of pho comes with three pretty decent sized ox tails so she thinks it's worth it! The broth was tasty, the only thing is they need to add more noodles. Oxtail fried rice was decent to me. The big bone marrow soup was yum, it was like a mountain of bony goodness!! My dad wanted to take the bones back to my dog and according to the waiter, a lot of people do that!

Anyway, the second time I was in Vegas was this month and during my visit, i dined here twice! We ordered the same thing as my first visit plus we tried the garlic noodles, garlic wings, edamame. The garlic noodles were out of this world amazing! It was so simple yet so garlicky good! If you're a fan of garlic, you need to get this dish! Garlic wings were ok...I think they were like 6.95 for six wings, pretty pricey in my opinion. I didn't try the edamame but my friend liked it.",8-65BXKgEvkdwtuQOTyBYQ,0,0,5,-B5ZOj5w38PklM2-zQlZ2g

Since I had my heart set on pork belly, it took me a little bit to recoup and figure out what to order. I finally decided on the combination rice plate with shortrib and my dining companion opted for the steak and eggs. The food came out pretty quickly, although my dish came out a few minutes before my friends, which was a little annoying. The lobster pho looked good as they were serving it to a neighboring table, so that definitely piqued my interest for my next interest.

I enjoyed my shortribs and everything I tried was solid, just nothing amazing. Service was good but refills were a little hard to come by.

District One is a modern Vietnamese fusion cuisine that offers traditional plates like pho with a twist. There are a bunch of TVs in the restaurant and seating for tables, booths, and a bar.

Their alcohol and wine list is pretty detailed. I usually try different beers when I'm in here. They all taste yummy.

I had the steak and eggs. I opted for the normal steamed rice because I tried the tomato rice before and was not really a fan. The meat was good and the taste had a lot of flavor. No complaints at all!

The reason I can't make this place a normal go to is because the price is a tad bit expensive compared to other pho restaurants. Yes, they offer an amazing lobster pho and/or surf and turf pho, but that will cost you $30 for essentially what is still pho. If I want a normal pho bowl, I can think of a lot of places where I would pay less and probably pay as much as I would here but already have gratuity included.",lqrfzgZUKl0dXt6HAim2kQ,0,0,4,EJ5YyFFmQW-NLuXsO1AyQA
