Always made fresh fish has light batter but huge pieces we always share a fish and shrimp basket with chowder and it's way too much food for two. It's inexpensive unlike most food in Vegas.

Hits the spot ever so just right. This place is also delicious when high out of your mind and aren't quite sure what the hell you're eating.

BEST fish ever... crispy outside, tender and flavorful inside.  So, had to stop by again to savor this treat.  Well, sadly, it's not the same as previously noted.  The first piece of fish was very good... just what I remembered... but the second piece had a distinctly ""fishy"" smell and flavor, like it was not fresh.  Did not finish it and very disappointed.  The chips were not crisp (McDonald's french fries are better).

We just found Fulton Fish Market in New York, New York on the ground floor near the front entrance.  Our lunch there was decent and was easily half the price of eating at a hamburger joint.

The calamari rings are frozen from a bag and the ""garlic"" shrimp are actually pre cooked shrimp battered and then cooked again. Hot rubbery trash. Everything was bland. No seasoning in their batter. 

If you live near water, or eat seafood often I say never eat here. I assume the 5 star reviews are from people who don't get fresh seafood ever. 

I guess the only good thing is that it's really cheap. (You get what you pay for.) But if your in Las Vegas with hundreds of great food options, why would you ever eat frozen seafood? You could go to the grocery store anywhere in the country and buy the same product they are selling you here!

As a huge fan of fish & chips ( or freedom fries as they are known in this country), I had to try out Fulton's take on the classic.

The Fish: I believe it was cod.Judging from the rubbery texture, not very fresh.As all fish does, it breaks apart very easily once you try to cut into it.I ended up just eating it with my hands.Definitely not the best tasting fish i've ever had.

The Fries: The 2nd best part of the meal.The fries were seasoned and even though you can tell they were frozen, still very good.They mix very well with the tartar sauce.

The Tartar Sauce: The best part of the meal.It hid the crappy taste of the fish and saved me from 1-starring this place.I would actually be willing to back here just to get some more of the tartar sauce.

Overall: Next time, I am splurging and going to Nine Fine Irishmen to try out their fish & chips.This is definitely not the place to go for good seafood.",b4aIMeXOx4cn3bjtdIOo6Q,1,1,2,gMiwV5U_NcADaIYdimxXOg

Now that I've tried this clam chowder that he talks about from time to time, I think it's pretty good. But not the best clam chowder I've had. It doesn't compare to the ones I've had in the Bay Area. With that said, they do give a huge portion for $6 + tax. There is a good amount of clams and it also comes with ham that gives off a subtle smokey flavor. It's creamy and the bread bowl is fluffy and soft. 

This clam chowder definitely makes the list of good cheap eats for sure. I can see college kids making their Vegas trip worthwhile at a joint like this.

We ordered the family meal (around $20) which included chicken, fish, hush puppies, french fries, coleslaw and shrimp. My dad asked for more chicken and less fish because I can't eat too much fish and my mom detests fish. The cashier simply rolled her eyes and was very rude. Umm...sorry? Not cool.

Our group was in a hurry to make it to the last showing of Zumanity so we decided to find somewhere to eat in New York New York. I'm not a fan of a sit down restaurant when I go to Vegas. I'm all about the buffets and trying out little shops like this place. Plus, a nice sit down place would require a lot of waiting around for servers, looking over a big menu, etc. This place had a line of 5 or so, after ordering, it took another 5 to get my food.

I've never been here before and since I was the only one who decided not to spend almost $100 a person (my group went to Gallagher's steakhouse) I ordered the combo that had chicken, fish, shrimp, hush puppies & fries so I can try everything. This is why eating with a group is better. everyone can order one thing and try everything. I love clam chowder and decided to get a cup/bowl of that too (don't like bread so no bread bowl for me)

THE CLAM CHOWDER IS AMAZING! I don't know if they laced it with crack but it was the most amazing chowda I've ever had. I've had some good ones in Boston, but this was awesome, fresh chunky clams, possibly a hint of bacon? I could do without the potatoes in it though. If you past by and there's no line, get a cup!

The fish was nicely fried, not too thick of a batter, the meat was flaky and tasted fresh. the chicken strip was pretty nasty and had no flavor, I would have been moist cardboard that's been fried... just don't get the chicken. Shrimp was okay, but I can tell by the texture that they were not fresh.....I'm not saying I expect live shrimp to be flown into Las Vegas! But it's probably been sitting UNFROZEN for too long.

New York New York did it right, there are plenty of seats and tables along the ""streets"" so get a tray of food and enjoy!",O70j6FC1Bq09T0xkVNsstA,1,0,4,Y0fCQycyNNtDTRgD5XePlw

First, I was told they were out of hush puppies as part of the family meal, but they would add a piece of chicken instead. Then, we were told they were ALSO out of the shrimp (as part of the family meal), so I asked if they could sub fried clams instead of fried shrimp and was immediately told ""no, but we can give you another piece of chicken"". I immediately questioned this since a piece of chicken is not comparable to fried shrimp and they asked if I wanted to talk to the manager. I replied ""yes"", not realizing this meant I would need to call the manager on the phone. 

**Side Rant: if you are going to be out of two items included in a Family Meal deal, either make a decision beforehand, or empower your employees to make a decision on substitutions that make sense. Rant over. 

The manager ended up substituting the clam strips for the shrimp. 

My son ordered the clam chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl and they served it in a plastic bowl with a slice of bread in a plastic container for him. What a joke!

Overall, the food was okay. The clam strips and the fish were good. Nobody wanted to eat the chicken and the waffle fries were way overcooked.

Ask the guys working what time they close, they say 11, it is only 10, we closed early. The last trip I decided I would question management, this girl that came out had no idea what customer service is.  No apology for the inconvenience, basically said I don't care.  My question is, the order we were going to place would have around $100, and if we wanted fish, who is to say that others might as well.  She said they close early when it is slow, why we stood their questioning them closing early, 3 others walked up to find them closed!  I question is that being slow or are they just lazy and want to go home.  Not sure most malls like this have contractual agreements on hours!  Maybe a few fines for closing early and they will stop!

The clam chowder back there is always fresh, never too heavy, perfect amount of potato to soup ratio and a large handful of clam. Fulton's is the closest to that clam chowder that I have tasted out west, and I will happily eat there several times a month if possible.

Is Fulton's chowder pretty creamy? Sure. Is MA chowdah (I had to)super creamy? It's not supposed to be, but that's okay and forgivable. There are worse seafood sins to commit. I love that it tastes fresh and that oh, it's gluten free! Nothing else at this restaurant is gluten free, but this chowder is and I LOVE IT! Many chowders thicken with a rue. Not Fulton's. Straight cream and the natural starchiness of the potatoes make this soup divine. I love that it isn't too salty, piping hot, and for those who can, grab that sourdough bread bowl to put it in (even though I think that's a crime, but moving forward).

My mother in law, husband's, uncle, aunt and cousin (all from Scotland)feel that Fulton's has some of the best fish and chips in the U.S. When compared to the homeland of fish and chips, it is still very good, and that is saying a lot. Consistent in quality, not overly greasy, HUGE portion (easily able to split it between two people), and flaky, delicious and even the chips are great. Drizzle some malt vinegar on those bad boys and my husband and his family are very, very happy and continue to go there each time they visit. Great value for the money you spend, and a nice quick bite that isn't so hard on your budget. Like I said, my entire family could eat there every day if we let them.

The second piece of fish smelled like the San Francisco wharf! I had notice my wife stopped eating and poured more vinegar on her fish, as soon as I bite into my fish I realized why. I don't know what happened, rather the deep fryers not hot enough, fish poor quality or simply not cooked long enough. Irregardless we were not finishing this plate.

First off, their fried items are fresh. It doesn't come frozen when they fry it. You can actually see them dipping the items in batter and frying it. After seeing all of this, I couldn't wait. However, it was a bit of a let down.

We ordered the fish and chips, fried clams, and clam chowder in a bread bowl. All of this came out close to $30, with the addition of the add on meal. For $4 more, you get a large drink with a cole slaw.

I really wanted to try the clam chowder. That's my soup of choice. I just wanted it in a cup. They only offer it in the bread bowl so I was forced to get it. The soup was good. It had chunks of clam and potato in it. It wasn't overly salty. I ended up throwing the bread bowl away.

The menu was misleading. I ordered fried clams, I got fried clam STRIPS. Most of the clam strips were tiny and it was all breading. The fries that it came with were huge and crispy.

My husband's meal came with two big pieces of fried fish. I tried a bite of it and it was the best thing that was ordered. The fish was moist and smooth on the inside of the hot, crispy breading.",sPbKpor4w91rp5Dw2EhIbw,11,5,3,Kr3I2Bh1L5P5vrz2F56NNQ

My experience at Fulton Fish Market was as close as I've been at eating ""fresh"" seafood. I know, I know. It's not even on the east coast, so I've never actually come close.

My clam chowder was fantastical. The perfect amount of salt, pepper and clams. I'm very particular about how I like the consistency and taste of my soup and it lived up to my expectations. I would absolutely, positively order it again. The only reason for not a perfect rating is I didn't particularly enjoy the bread bowl as much. I would have liked just a giant bowl of the soup with some crusty bread on the side.

My husband ordered the fish and chips. I know people out there hate the word 'amazing' but I can't think of anything else to describe it.
