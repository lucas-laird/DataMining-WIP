This place is good, but it's just that A-OK. I mean I feel like if this was fantastic food for this price then people would maybe realize fresh, healthy is very tasty and can be fast foods and it would be a hit. I like it but getting a combo is like $10-12 and I dont see how this will work for just good enough to satisfy people looking for good food and don't really care if it's healthy or not. Healthy food goers- probably find this place wonderful though as it's slim pickins in this town. 

I enjoy their airbaked fries and chicken. I like that they have flavored ketchup. Their black bean and turkey burgers are good. Their smoothies are good and its not as fatty as a smoothie at the usual places.

There were just a handful of people despite it being lunch time. I ended up ordering the black bean burger and a fruit cup. The place might have fresh food, but it certainly was not fast. The black bean burger was pretty tasty though. It was a little spicy, which was a nice twist.

The fruit cup included watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, and strawberries. All but the strawberries were good.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,2,0,4,p2VgocFmAV5tEcicddx7aw

The place is nice inside for fast food. The people are helpful and make suggestions. They don't deep fry the fries, the method is supposed to create a fry that had 40% less fat and the hamburger beef is supposed to be hormone free which is all great but the price is a couple dollars more than a typical fast food place. 

I really liked it and will probably come back.",SFeJIeDP3HOI2nFk906Wyg,1,1,4,8FBLE8PXioJuFbOee_7JzQ
