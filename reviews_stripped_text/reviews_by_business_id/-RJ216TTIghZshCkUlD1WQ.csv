76694,2015-11-22,0,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"Every sushi and dish we had represents Japan.  My wife found the restaurant from a blog of a Japanese resident of the town.  The location is off-the strip, and in a strip mall of the middle of Chinatown.  Nonetheless, the chef Takashi offered perfection of his creation.  We had nearly ten kinds of nigiri type sushi, fish on rice, plus grilled mackerel, fish cake stew, miso soup and pickled vegi.  Materials are very fresh, and precisely prepared.  Sushi rice was perfectly cooked and flavored. Of special note, the chef brighten up the flavor of salmon roe by marinating as the northern Japanese way.  The pickled vegi is also the northern Japanese version with rice based flavor.  Mackerel was nicely chosen and cooked perfectly.  The chef made great effort for the miso soup and fish cake stew, which can be recommended for every one who loves real Japanese food.  Another surprise came in the end, with the extremely generous size of bill.  I am sure that this restaurant will be the best sushi place in my town if he opens one.

157890,2016-08-13,0,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"I feel very lucky to have found Sushi Takashi, somewhat randomly selecting it based on a few Yelp reviews. We were visiting from out of town (everyone flying in from coast to coast) and I needed a family reunion dinner venue (11 people total - my older parents, two siblings, and four little nieces and nephews, one of whom has severe food allergies to nuts, gluten/wheat, soy, dairy, etc.). I selected Sushi Takashi simply because it was Japanese-owned and could accommodate a larger party, and because it was a range of ages, I wanted something family-friendly but not too touristy - i.e., not a Nobu or Sushi Samba, but not a Benihana.

The Sushi Takashi staff were SO accommodating and attentive, even though my family was ""That Party"" with all these random demands and being pretty high maintenance :-) Constant attention to our table by 3-4 different servers, our water glasses were never empty, we kept asking to order extra things (we were hungrier than we thought), and everything was extremely fresh, including the large sashimi platter.  My sister and I joked that we thought even the water tasted better than normal, and our server ended up informing us that the restaurant spends several hundred dollars a month on a special water filtering system - our taste buds were right!

We ended up going to Sushi Takashi two of our three nights in Las Vegas, and even on the one night that we ate a nearby Chinese restaurant, we made a special third trip back to Sushi Takashi to pick up a meal for my niece - the Chinese restaurant could not accommodate her food allergies, and she was crazy about the grilled salmon that Sushi Takashi specially prepared for her, so she was thrilled to eat it three nights in a row!

Mr. Takashi himself held court behind the sushi bar and couldn't be nicer - he spoke Japanese with my mother, and both nights he sent over complimentary miso soups, a turnip and butternut squash soup (truly delicious), and a sashimi/ceviche-style platter for our large group. 

Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality, Sushi Takashi, and my family has already decided this will be our go-to place whenever we come to Las Vegas.",HWxW22QuTuduqFhWv5y51Q,0,1,5,__OzCTb0dzujbDQVbK8K6w

We were a party of 4 and all had the 12 course meal. I won't go into detail about each course except to say that every course was perfect. This is a lot of food, these courses are not tiny samples, they are small plates and around course 6 and 7 you start feeling it. I will recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas, such a tremendous value and such incredible food. I have noticed some yelpers complaining about the time it takes......IT'S 12 COURSES, you don't get them all at once, that would be dumb.

What's great other than the food being awesome is that you have options.  With each course there are at least two choices.  The plating of each course definitely matched the excellence of the flavor for each dish as well.  Since I had put a note in the reservation that it was my wife's birthday they also sent out a complementary dessert which tasted as great as it looked.

I am not a big sushi fan, but my wife loves it and this seemed to be off the charts.  So, I had to give it a try.  Boy, did it ever hit the ball out of the park.  This has to be one of my top five restaurants ever, worldwide.  My wife did the 10 course meal, which had her giggling with glee at how great everything tasted.  I tried their hot meals, which included Salmon Teriyaki, Beef Yakiniku and a half roll.  I tried the Blue Diamond, and I really liked it.  This is from someone who does not have the taste buds for sushi, sorry.  Every aspect of this meal was fantastic.  The salad dressing was amazing, I think I would have eaten weeds from my garden if it had that dressing on it.  The Beef Yakiniku absolutely blew me away, one of the best dishes I have ever tasted.  I tried random items from my wife's 10 course meal and after tasting each one, I was blown away how good the food tasted.

I arrived at about 8:30, and the restaurant was pretty empty. Kawika was my server and took care of me from start to finish.  He filled my water, took my order, brought out all of my food, and took my dirty dishes.  He was very attentive and although it was slow, seemed to have that sense of urgency I appreciate in a full service restaurant. 

I ordered the $15.95 combo plate with 2 orders of teriyaki chicken and a half order of the Hakodate signature roll (yellowtail, ponzu, jalapeño). To drink, I just had water. 

Food came out quick and was plated beautifully. I started with the salad which was definitely overdressed, but still delicious. I'll ask for light dressing next time. The chicken was thin cut (love it when Japanese restaurants do this!) and the sauce was watery, but it didn't seem to take away from the flavor. Maybe it's just a house-made teriyaki sauce?!  Either way, no complaints.  The roll was delicious. I love when sushi rolls have slices of jalapeño on top that are effective enough to taste + have a little bit of the seeds still attached. I hate those itty bitty small jalapeño slices that some sushi places put on top. Where do they even get jalapeños that small?!  Lol. 

Miso soup came with the meal and was ok.  I literally ate everything off of the plate, including the ginger. Lol. I was satisfied, but was craving something sweet...so I opted for the fried Oreos ($4.95).  How do you mess up fried Oreos?!  I mean, really you can't!  Yum. Yum. Yum. 

My check was $22, great value for what I got! 

I definitely want to come back with my boyfriend and go for the 12 course meal that I've read about from fellow yelpers!  Will update my review after I wake up from that coma. :)

P.s. They have the best tasting ""tap water"" ever. I saw a sign on the wall that says its Fuji water or something...not sure what that is, but it was really good and definitely worth mentioning. I love when restaurants add little perks like that. It's those small things that leave the biggest impact!",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,3,4,4,5-8exmVGmdWIO8wQ6zEsyg

1432140,2015-06-04,23,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"Sushi Takashi is located in the former short lived Hiromaru ramen joint. But, they have changed the interior completely, with dark sexy colors and wood, cool booths, and a wide sushi bar. After taking a seat at the bar, I met the man himself, Chef Takashi, who is a friendly and cool person. While they do have an a la carte menu, I was more interested in the shiny, laminated menu that had some more unique options. On one side contained a 10 course and 12 course menu. And on the other side, a combo menu with a whole lot of options including a bottomless one, a roll one, a never ending salmon bowl, and a quick to-go bento. They also have an $80 ayce option. I decided to go with the 12 course.

This was interesting because it wasn't like a traditional kaiseki, where the portions are super small. The value at Takashi's is better than most of the izakayas in the valley. And what else is interesting is that you modify the options on the course menu as you see fit.

Before the courses began, they brought out some mini Japanese crackers to snack on. They were good.

The first course was the the garlic edamame. The spices were really good and bright. And the edamame had a vibrant color.

The next course was the tuna carpaccio. The fish quality was excellent and it went well with soy dressing that had yuzu in it.

Next came the salad. I think that I made a great combo with the soba noodle and salmon skin options. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the salmon skin had a great texture to them. I enjoyed the tanginess of the mayo dressing that they used to bring everything together.

The meat dish came out next. I ordered the beef teriyaki. This was a simplified version of grilled beef that was seasoned lightly. The beef was of very good quality, and was cooked to a spot-on medium rare. The sauce was kept on the light side, and helped amplify the taste of the beef, rather than mask it as some other spots tend to do.

The chef also gave me a taste of the king crab that was available. You don't normally see this item in most sushi restaurants, and I appreciated that fact.

The next course was the roll course, in which you can choose from the menu any one of specialty rolls on the menu. I chose the King club roll, which is their king crab made into a roll with avocado. What I noticed immediately was that their rice is cooked perfectly, not too hard or soft, and I personally don't like a too strong of a vinegar taste, and I liked that Takashi's was more neutral-sweet, because that gives it more of a natural taste to the rice. Seriously, king crab and avocado? Now that's what i'm talking about!

Next course was the chicken, and I chose the karage. I liked the fact that the chicken were PIPING HOT!! A lot of sushi restaurants in Vegas can learn a thing or two from Takashi about making their karage more hot.

Next the seafood course came, and I picked the oysters. Six large oysters were brought out in this Asian mignonette style sauce. They were fresh and sweet. I literally could have eaten about 50 of these. They were amazing. 

Next, the sukiyaki came out. It came with a generous amount of beef, and it was fun eating it with the noodles, onions, and scallions. 

The baked dish was next so what looked like a dynamite baked roll came out and was very tasty as well.

My nigiri dish came out afterwards and I can say that I am impressed with the high quality of the fish they are using here. It's higher than Goyemon's and more like Yummy Grill's on Lake Mead (Not Eastern ave!!). The rice was perfect and everything just went really well together.

The soup course then came. I ordered the creamy white stew. Looking back, I would have probably chosen the miso. I liked the earthiness of the stew, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.

Chef Takashi wanted me to try their tuna belly before my last course as a gesture of their grand opening. Once again, they are using high quality fish, and they are thick slices. Mikey likes it!

My last course came out which was the dessert course. I ordered the tempura ice cream. The ice cream was exquisite, and the batter was very neutral tasting, which highlighted the ice cream.

Throughout the evening, what I realized was that I never felt rushed throughout the evening. The service was awesome, even though it's a brand new restaurant. It has actually been a really long time since I've felt just really comfortable eating at a sushi restaurant. My impression was that I was eating at a Strip high-end sushi restaurant, without having to pay those overpriced, exorbitant prices that those restaurants on the Strip usually command. Even though they have just opened, if they are able to maintain the quality, this would be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Great value, great quality, great service, great ambiance, that's all you can really ask for. I'm kinda over the AYCE thing, so i'm looking for a bit more, and Sushi Takashi delivers!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,42,37,5,9SsWLJUFUNwH-skgYQ_sfg

They added curtains and a board in between the barrel booths to provide privacy; i think it also helps keeps noise level down-prevents the echo of conversations. 

They have an expansive menu. Tons of options. We ordered several items, salmon rolls, yakiniku bowl, deep fried calamari, the avocado treasure chest and takoyaki. 

Everything came out as they were prepared. The treasure chest was phenomenal. It was my favorite out of everything (so far, since I'll be coming back). I would say the presentation was wonderful too. It was truly a japanese tapas style meal. I wouldn't come here wanting to be overwhelmingly full; definitely small bites and sharing. 

The food here is traditional Japanese. Come to this place looking for a palette adventures. The designs and presentations of these dishes is both eye catching and mouth watering. I would not come here to engulf food but rather take my time and really think about the blends of the flavors.

1593493,2015-10-10,1,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"Came here with my sister and my mom for my mom's birthday, and we had a pleasant experience. I definitely knew I wanted to try their set course dinner, but my family has a small appetite. We ended up getting a 10 course and a 12 course to share. We were served by two people during a dinner, a male and female (I wish I got the guy's name because he was great!). Our waiter let us know that because the courses are usually for one person, we would have to order something off the menu in order to let us share. I didn't mind this. 

Here's what we tried:
1) Garlic and Original Edamame: Definitely get the garlic edamame.
2) Salmon and Tuna Carpaccio: I think these two plates were some of my favorites of the course. At the end of the course, even though my stomach was about to explode, I wanted more of this. 
3) Soba and Tofu Salad: My mom ate most of both of these by herself because she enjoyed the dressing. Her small appetite was such lie!
4) Beef and Salmon Teriyaki: This was given to us towards the end of our course, and I was so scared for the portion size because I was getting full. However, I thought the size was just perfect. It was a little bit on the overcooked side though.
5) Blue Diamond Roll, Forgot Name?, and Baked Fantasy: All of these were recommended by our waiter, and we loved them. When he recommended ""forgot name"", we were like uhhhh how could you forget the name of one your favorite rolls??! But that's actually what it was called and got a good laugh out of it. Baked Fantasy melted in our mouths.
6) Oysters: I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but I chose this for my mom since it's her birthday (gotta treat her like what she actually is...a queen). After being disappointed by the quality of oysters in Vegas, she was amazed by how great it was here.
7) Tempura and Karaage: Didn't care much for them...I thought the fried batter on the tempura was too thick and the karaage was dry.
8) Sukiyaki: Expected from a sushi place, the interior was cold. Having this made us feel better and the beef is reaaallllyyy good in this. Also came with noodles.
9) Grilled Asparagus and Agedashi Tofu: I loved the grilled asparagus so much that I pretty much had to fight my family for it. Agedashi Tofu was okay to me. Maybe because I prefer the tofu to not be fried? 
10) Salmon Bowl: My family and I are salmon lovers so choosing this was a no-brainer. No regrets about this. The salmon was fresh and the texture of it was really silky..can't think of a better term. Try it!
11) Miso Soup: Naturally chose this option since none of us are fans of creamy soups. I thought it was more on the bland side, but I drank this while eating the fried food (tempura and karaage), so I made it work but balancing out fried and bland?? Does this logic even actually make sense..
12) Coffee Jelly w/ Ice Cream and Strawberry Ice Cream: It was a bit too sweet for my preference, but I was still able to enjoy it.

TL;DR
Fresh seafood. Huge variety and combinations that there's bound to be something that works for you. Make sure you have an appetite if you opt for the course dinners..and loose pants. Service was really good at first, but it went downhill for us at the end of our meal. A huge party entered, and the entire staff was waiting for them so I guess they forgot about us.

The owner has a lot of pride in his business. There is a timeline out front that outlines his career from an immigrant to a top chef on the strip to opening his own place. 

We sat the sushi bar and I got a box with teriyaki salmon and beef. It came complete with miso soup and a little salad. My friends ordered lots of sushi and it all looked incredible.

Coming in with an empty stomach after a long day hiking around Red Rocks, our eyes were a little bigger then our stomachs, but we devoured so much sushi it was worth it! It's located in the Chinatown section of Vegas, not too far from the strip. 

We started out with the Avocado Treasure chest! Trust me, this thing is amazing! It's tuna, salmon, crab and shrimp wrapped in avocado and sitting in a pool of ponzu sauce. This is a show stopper! Order it and you will not be disappointed! 

We also ordered a 12 piece chicken Kara-age (ask for the kewpie mayo), gyoza, spicy tuna roll, red dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll and tuna Hawaii roll. The rolls were so fresh, they were so delicious, we walked out of here stuffed!

I appreciate that they offer several specials as well as typical a la carte options, and the menu itself is extensive, with several apps, a giant page of rolls, and everything in between.

CHICKEN KARAGE: So crispy, so juicy! I love Japanese fried chicken, and the version put out here is done just right.
SALMON SKIN SALAD: Holy giant portions, Batman! This salad alone could easily be a lunch, packed with fish (not just skin), fruit, and an ample amount of fresh veggies in a light, flavorful dressing. Nice variety of textures, too.
3 ROLL COMBO: This option allows you to pick three special rolls, and get bottomless miso soup, house salad, and dessert (various ice creams) for a crazy-low $26, which is easily enough food for two people but at a cost that rivals the AYCE pricing elsewhere. The miso was standard but the house salad was the first I've come across in an Asian restaurant that included avocado! Add some of the chicken from your karage app and this could easily be a ""safe"" meal for a kid or picky eater. Opted for the Nagasaki (great cilantro sauce!), the Orange Lemon (citrus + seafood = love), and the Sapporo (just enough spice) and found them all unique and tasty, with fresh fish, minimal rice, and tasty (but not overpowering) sauces. 

The food was so tasty that we kept ordering and my stomach staged a revolt after the onslaught of food. But in a good way. Pricing is very fair: even a sashimi appetizer plate for two (~10 pieces) is an extremely reasonable $15. I'll definitely be coming back- in addition to the amazing food, the service is on point (ask for Jeffrey!), and the interior is a fun mix of classy and rustic.

That being said, maybe I just chose the wrong rolls.  I got the Kind Club roll which was good but boring honestly.  I also got the Steak Roll which was way too heavily sauced (with spicy mayo) and that just overpowered everything else on it.  The miso soup and the salad were quite tasty and the ice cream wasn't bad but I just wish I had a choice of some of their other dessert items.

Sushi Takashi offers a variety of Japanese food, not only sushi.  There are a wide range of desserts (shaved ice and tempura ice cream) as well as other Japanese cuisine, like sukiyaki and curry.

There is an All-You-Can Eat option for around seventy dollars, but the course options are of variegated choices while still very filling.  I tried the ten-course sushi dinner, and it was more than enough food.  

My particular favourite was the scallop carpaccio.  It was topped with masago, a tangy sauce, a very thin lemon slice, and garnished with a small bit of cilantro.  The tangy lemon and sauce blended very nicely with the rich, buttery scallop.

The quality and variety of food is great, but I think the food could be served in a more timely fashion--I want plenty of time to wolf it down!

That's sushi takashi. Me and a buddy came here after hearing about their happy hour deal through Vegas eater. And we weren't disappointed!

We arrived pretty late (about 1.5 hours before their closing time) and after reviewing both their regular and happy hour menus, ordered:
Chicken karage (HH)
Half order scallop yum yum(HH)
Half order spicy tuna (HH)
4 piece nigiri
1 piece of the Italian nigiri
Touch and go dinner (comes w/1 half order special roll)
(..We got the teriyaki salmon & spicy yakiniku, and tempura LoouooLL)

..to make this as short and straight to the point as possible, every piece of fish was perfectly portion sized cut (generous sized) and most of all very fresh. To match our meal, the owner, was equally as generous. We had made a mistake ordering only 1 Italian nigiri and upon placing a second order, he gave it to us for free. And then he gave us an extra piece of nigiri with our 4 piece order, and made all our half order rolls, full orders. Wow talk about service!

The staff was also all very nice and attentive to us as well, I don't think I ever seen my glass only half full (after coming to takashi I'm now an optimist). The servers always made sure our drinks were completely filled and we had everything we needed.

The salmon teriyaki and our chicken karage was very moist! This was something that actually really took me by surprise since I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't over cook these 2 items dry. The yakiniku was really good and interesting, sort of reminded us both of pizza.. And the Italian nigiri was a smooth and tasteful blend of what I think was pesto and Ikira on top of the lightly seared fish and had a very pleasant and juicy flavor...

I came here this past December with my uncle who lives in Vegas. He knows the good local spots, and I fly to Vegas every 2 or 3 months or so.
So what caught my eye first....Japanese sushi chef! Takashi-san does a tremendous job molding sushi and cutting fish.
Originally we were planning to order the limited time offer, $50 bucks for a sashimi platter for I think 2 people, each! However, the Kaiseki-Ryori or the 12-course sushi dinner got my attention instead. About $40 for the 12 course dinner, which would be considered dirt cheap in SF for the quantity and quality of food. Yeah, I know cost of living is a lot higher in SF, but damn I feel like a baller when I'm eating in Vegas. 
I took a picture, of most of things I ate, but I couldn't fit it all into one photo because it was too many items lol.
We received an additional 13th item on the house, a salmon miso soup which was delicious.
You get a sheet with a combination of your order. You basically get to select 1 of 2 or 3 different selections per course to customize your meal.
Everything was on point. I don't think there was even anything I would even consider just average, it was all great!
My uncle and I were conversing with Takashi-san during dinner in Japanese. I'm not 100% fluent, but I was able to communicate and I felt that that made the experience so much better. It was like chatting with an old friend or acquaintance.

I've been back to Vegas twice already in 2017, but unfortunately have not been able to make it back out here because they are open for dinner only and my uncle's work schedule hasn't allowed us to come back on the days I visit. I will be back for sure in June when I drive down to Vegas with my dad!",13L_l5JE_tYqt4UpmCNm1g,1,0,5,a9cw6xx-SjvU5I1Z5Ij5LQ

They don't have a full bar just beers and sakes ... but the deal of the day was $1 Miller lites so we took up that offer why not :) 

They also have daily specials ..... we got some salmon belly and another fish sashimi and the baked mussels along with the super white tuna carpaccio and a Spicy tuna roll

The sashimi was delicious and very fresh we lovedddd he baked mussels they were cooked perfectly with right spices 

My carpaccio though was AMAZING I loved it the most the fish was fresh the sauces were perfectly matched it was just yummy perfection in my mouth

My mother and I each had the touch and go meal set. It consisted of a half of a special roll, your choice, miso soup, salad, steamed rice, tsukemono, and two protein choices. I had the teriyaki chicken and the teriyaki salmon. Both the chicken and the salmon were cooked to perfection. The teriyaki sauce was great, not super heavy and not too sweet nor too salty. 

My husband indulged in the 10 course meal. Everything looked and tasted amazing. He had a small salmon bowl, salmon carpaccio, agedashi tofu, salmon teriyaki, rice, salad, red bean ice cream, corn and egg soup, half a speciality roll, edamame and maybe one more item that I can't recall. Each item was great. The portions of salmon were all generous ones. The flavors were great and as mentioned above, everything was so fresh. The salmon melted in your mouth like butter. 

My kid brother had the salmon overflow bowl. The picture on the menu, that's exactly what it looks like when it comes from the chef. There is no skimping at all. The rice underneath is tender and pre seasoned. Yum!! The salmon is top quality and the chef will continue to give you great cuts, especially fatty and so silky, until you tell the waiters that you're all tapped out. Man!! I'm telling you, this place is just awesome and so delicious. If you truly appreciate great sushi and sashimi, this spot is a must!! 

Kinda funny, the waiter heard avocado instead of Masago so at one point, an order of avocado nigiri was brought to our table. Oops. LOL. We mentioned it to the waiter and we all shared a good laugh. The nice thing, although he misheard that portion of the order, he didn't question our selection when it was initially made. An once we brought up the tiny mistake, he quickly went to correct it without any problems. And generously, he let us keep our avocado nigiri. LOL! When the Masago came out, it was not only beautiful in presentation but it was also such a beautiful fresh bright orange color. Delicious!! 

The wait staff works as a team. It was nice to not always have to go to our usual waiter to ask for things. All the waiters were willing to help us, no matter if it was adding another order of sushi, a drink request, or something simple like an extra plate or replacement pair of hashi. Water was always being refilled without request or reminder. Plates were constantly being removed from our table as well, to make room for entrees, rolls, on the house additions, etc. 

The chef really appreciated our business and our feedback. He gave us each our own bowl of his special salmon soup, on the house. The soup broth was phenomenal and there were big hunks of salmon in each of our bowls. After paying our bill, the chef also gave us some of his special cereal like dessert that he makes himself, in house. I am told it's like Capt crunch cereal but in strawberry and green tea flavors. I've never had Capt crunch before but this stuff was magnificent, especially in its creamy seeming flavor. I'd easily come back here during my next trip to Vegas!!!!

I made reservations for dinner here on New Year's Eve. The service is impeccable. We were constantly being check by our servers making sure everything was to our liking. 

A few changes to the menu based on the other Yelpers who tried this place before me. They included Salmon on their Teriyaki and removed the Baked and replaced it with Vegetables (Asparagus or Broccoli). 

Here are the dishes that really stood out for me (good and bad): 

1. Garlic Edemame: Way better than the regular one or the Pepperoncini. Do not think the pepperoncini will taste anything like the pickled peppers. It was just edemame with chili flakes.

2. Super-White-Tuna & Scallop Carpaccio: These were delicious! They tasted fresh and sweet which was really a surprise to me because I personally do not like raw food but I totally made an exception with this one. 

3. Hamburger: Okay, this one is pretty weird and even our server admits it. I feel like it should not be part of the 12 course dinner. I'm guessing this is for people who do not really like sushi/raw fish so they can have an option. But this seriously left me dumbfounded. It is a full burger meal with fries and everything. It was not until after I finished the burger that out of curiosity, I asked if it can be changed to the other burger options (Teriyaki, Takashi, Teriyaki Tsukune, Salmon Fry Burger) and they said yes but it will be an additional charge. Good to know for future reference.

4. Beef Sukiyaki: This was really delicious. The soup was a little sweet to my taste but the beef was so tender that I still loved the dish over all. Definitely get this over the Diced Steak. The steak was dry and the flavor was peppery so I was not really a fan of that. Plus who wants hard steak anyway?

5. Corn and Egg Soup: I would recommend something else rather than ordering this. I was pretty disappointed with it. A little too sweet too.

After two hours of battling against food, I am proud to say that I finished. They should really give some sort of medal/award to people who can actually finish. That was a lot of food! Next time I come back, no more 12-course meal. I would come back to order little bits of things that I liked.

Found this place on yelp and saw its high praise and was really prepared to have a nice dinner with my fiancé. When we arrived we were told there was no seating available at that moment and that there would be a 20 minute wait (we were the only ones waiting at that time) but hey, that's fine, no problem! The guy we were speaking to then said with a snarky attitude that people usually call and make reservations and maybe we should do that next time. Ooooook, thanks for the tip pal. We go outside to wait since there's not much of a waiting area unless you want to block anyone coming in or out. When I step outside I notice two seats at the sushi bar that are empty but there's a bus boy bin that had been left there. We wait about 15 minutes and go in and ask about it since they are two perfectly good seats that just need the dirty dish bin moved. They said they didn't realize those seats were available and they'll clean it up for us now. Annoying but fine. A booth ends up opening at the same time so we take this instead. Time to start ordering! Except even this is a bit of the mess, I have to ask for 3 different types of beverages because they were out of the first two I asked for. We get our cans of soda and this is the last time our waiter acknowledges our existence. Our food is brought out by someone else and we somehow end up getting our appetizer AFTER our main dishes . I ordered the Tokyo roll which was good (a little heavy on the sauces) and the steak roll (trying to be adventurous) and it was disappointing and kind of gross. The steak is laid across the top of the roll and didn't seem to be seasoned at all so didn't really contribute much to the roll in flavor. Then I realize that the underside of each piece of steak is completely raw, they seared one side which is showing but the rest is raw. Now I understand I'm at a sushi restaurant, I can deal with raw fish, but I can deal with totally raw beef, especially when it doesn't specify in the menu the steak will be raw. Didn't finish the roll. Not ONCE did anyone check on us to see if everything was ok or if we needed another drink. Our waiter seemed to go out of his way to avoid us. I was finally able to flag down someone for the check and the bill was just shy of $70 for 4 rolls, 2 of which weren't great, 1 appetizer that came late, and 2 cans of sprite. Our normal spot will usually cost me $50 max and the food and service are a hell of a lot better.

Pretty solid sushi joint, but I just think there are better options in the area and in Vegas as a whole which is noted for its love of good fish.  I cam late for the happy hour deal from 9-12pm, and was told 3 separate times about a strict midnight close, last call at 11:30pm, and kitchen closing at 11:30pm.  We said no big deal but the waiter was very pushy with us.

Ass far as the meal goes, everything was fantastic.  The sushi was fresh and very thick with the tuna and salmon innards.  The salmon tartar dish was super fresh and quite large, and with the addition of a runny egg was a great choice.  The sake was meh to be honest, even as a typical house variety.

Overall the food was above average but the prices reflect that, even on the Happy Hour menu.  Service was intrusive and not very friendly especially since there was only about 1 other group of people there during our dining experience.

Even then it was too late cause we were done with dinner! They didn't give us any water refills and had ran out of lemonade when i ordered one when i first arrived there! Then when my friend ordered an Arnold palmer, they couldnt make her one cause they didn't have lemonade!!! Smh! If you want awesome good sushi go here but don't expect awesome customer service for your first time, or maybe it was just one of those nights! Disappointed on service , loved the food!

After checking in to our hotel room at 8pm we decided to head out for a japanese dinner outside the Vegas strip. With the help of Yelp reviews, I chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. 
We arrived at the restaurant at around 9pm. All the barrel looking booths were occupied, so we were led to a table close to the sushi bar. Good move!
I read about their 10 or 12 course meal but we were not ready to be stuck with those choices. We decided to explore the menu. We ordered the following:
1. Sashimi plate for 4 - all the fish varieties were delicious. These were the super white tuna, halibut, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, mackarel, squid, octopus. I particularly loved the super white tuna, yellowtail & salmon. My friend loved the mackarel.
2. Hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) - big portion. It was grilled to perfection. Melted in my mouth
3. Blue diamond - very good sushi. I love sushi without any mayo or sauces added to it because it does not cover up the taste of the fresh fish
4. Large Tree - this sushi had mayo & eel sauce but since I am bot a fan of all these stuff added on top of the sushi, our awesome waiter suggested that they could place the sauces on the side. Good call.  The softshell crab in this sushi was so delicate. It was crispy on the outside & juicy on the inside. With a little dab of the sauces, it enhanced the flavor of the sushi
While we were indulging on the great food, Chef Takashi sent a plate of sauteed chinese broccoli & individual soup bowls of pumpkin soup for free. They were so good! The vegetable was great with our hamachi kama. The soup was light but delicious & the pumpkin pieces was cooked perfectly & it added the sweetness to the soup.
5 Tempura Ice Cream - to top off the food extravaganza, we had this wonderful dessert. The blend of the vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, whipped cream & the crunchiness of the tempura batter was divine

Thank you for a wonderful experience, Chef Takashi. It was great chatting with you as well. Til our next adventure to Las Vegas!",iqH5NpbxpviuFnlzpRFI2A,3,3,5,bQJgH40FHCZIy12LW4EIWw

4040327,2018-06-28,0,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"A fantastic find around the Vegas strip.  We went for a business dinner and it was a very appropriate location. 

Service- knowledgeable, friendly, quick and attentive. 

Atmosphere - cozy. Felt like a true Izakaya in Japan. 

Drink - we only did Sake but their list has a good number of options. I do however wish they had more large sake bottles. 

Food - first of all, the menu has pictures of everything so that can be very helpful for some. I am not a fan of rolls so I can't comment on them. However the sashimi and sushi are very fresh and of high quality. Cooked dishes were also done very well. Chicken Karrage was very good. Grilled Whole squid was also very nice.  They also have good higher end fish cuts like Yellow Tail belly, Salmon Belly and Fatty Tuna. It should be noted that I did also appreciate the cut. It's not a sliver or slab but the right proportion to taste the fish and not feel cheated that you are not getting enough. Oh I should also note that they have fresh wasabi. 

Price - excellent value. Small boat of sashimi, edamame, Chicken Karrage, grilled squid, fried Tofu, 2 orders of halibut sushi, 2 orders of eel sushi. 2 orders of yellowtail belly sushi, 4 orders of salmon belly, 5 orders of fatty tuna and 3 bottles of sake.

Michael K.'s glowing review piqued my interest in Sushi Takashi, and when a friend invited me here, I eagerly accepted. I arrived a bit before the official 5pm start and was greeted by warm employees and cool air. The decor bears little resemblance to past businesses, with wooden tables and floors and bright but not overpowering light.

While waiting for my companion, I was able to peruse the a la carte menu and the various combination menu offerings. The three roll combo ($25.95) and the bottomless dinner ($22.95) both seem like decent options for another time, and even the AYCE offering for $79.95 might be worth a splurge on a special occasion (when asked, the server said that 2 orders of carpaccio could be included in addition to the premium items listed in fine print).

However, I'd already set my mind on the 12-course sushi dinner ($39.95), which contains sukiyaki, a choice of oyster or king crab, and a couple of other small upgrades when compared to the 10-course dinner ($29.95).

Before critiquing the food, I should note that the flow of the dishes was a little bit rushed at times, but nothing was left out too long, and they postponed dessert until we were ready.

Complimentary appetizer: Kakinotane. Rice crackers with soy and wasabi flavorings. Great crunch. The wasabi packs a punch if you're not accustomed to it.

#1: Edamame. My friend's peperoncino didn't add much flavor, but I loved my choice of garlic. Perfectly cooked beans to boot.

#2: Carpaccio. Yellowtail and scallop, shared. Both were delightfully fresh, and the roe was a nice topping for the scallop. Best dishes of the night.

#3: Salad. Sampled some of my friend's tofu w/ salmon skin. Some of the better tofu that I've had for sure, but the skin was a little too charred for my taste. My soba salad was ridiculously good with a powerful but not sickeningly heavy dressing, slick noodles, and substantial and tasty grilled salmon.

#4: Teriyaki meat. The beef was tasty and grilled, and it was more tender than tough. I see no reason to choose chicken unless beef is strictly outside of your diet.

#5: Sushi roll (shared). The King Club roll featured king crab, although I hesitate to call it the star. Its flavor was lost until eaten alone. I wouldn't order it again since the proportion of the crab isn't sufficient. The second roll, Blue Diamond, was the better option. It featured salmon, cucumber, and super white tuna in garlic ponzu.

#6: Seafood cold dish. We both chose oysters. Each plate featured four plump oysters (an apparent downsize from prior weeks) and a parsley garnish. They were thoroughly fresh, plump, and flavorful, and as of this writing have not assaulted either of our digestive systems. I'd pick this again as well.

#7: Fried food. We both chose tempura, which is a generous basket of three shrimp tempura and six vegetable tempura. The batter was a little too prominent and the sauce a little too weak. I'd pick something else next time.

#8: Beef. We both had sukiyaki, which was presented in a very hot bowl. This is where we started to exceed capacity, and the best thing about this not being an AYCE meal is that doggy-bagging something is not a problem. I did eat a small portion, and it was delightful with tender beef, silky tofu, and a sweet broth.

#9: Hot entree. We both chose the mini doria. I'd liken it to lasagna, but with rice. This ground beef and rice bowl is out of place on the menu because of its prominent tomato flavoring. It's good, but the 4 piece baked roll would better match the menu (and not require stomach expansion). But hey, more leftovers!

#10: Miscellany. I went into left field with the burger. With gooey cheese, toasted bun, and onions, it's surprisingly tasty. The medium doneness of the patty was acceptable. However, the fries that accompanied the burger were not so good. They were salted properly and fluffy inside, but their exteriors were mostly devoid of any sort of crunch. I would skip the burger solely to avoid having to see the pale yellow potato pieces ever again.

#11: Soup. Creamy corn sounds good, but it was very watery. I was almost too full to care at this point, but it's a shame that good egg and corn would have their flavor so diluted.

#12: Dessert. Nothing special about my friend's matcha jelly with ice cream. My tempura ice cream wasn't exceptional either, but the sweetness of the toppings somehow hit the spot at the right time. Neither choice can be mistaken for gourmet or premium.

Despite some flaws, the meal was great. I could see myself returning soon. The poster outside highlights the history of Chef Takashi as a pioneer of AYCE in Las Vegas, but his featured non-AYCE offerings would satiate all but the most stretchy-stomached. And hey, there's even a stamp card for 10- and 12-course dinner.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,4,9e4qWjOvt9G59GnO6cxSdA

As soon as I walked in to Takashi, I fell in love. I don't remember what I ordered. But there are pictures to demonstrate how delicious and fresh the sushi is.

We were in Vegas visiting family friends that have been long time customers of the chef here. Maybe my first time in this establishment would be different from those entering without someone having a person knowing their particular taste. We ordered quite a few dishes from the ika sashimi, karaage, several edomae nigiri dinner sets, ikura and salmon bowl, kaisen bowl, natto maki ( my little ones must have their natto) yellowtail sashimi and some other items that I can't remember due to my food coma I'm trying to think through. Everything tastes incredibly fresh and everything seemed the proper temperature. Rice was a perfect proportion to the slices of fish for me. I always hate when you get an onigiri sized ball of rice ( redundant, I know) and a paper thin slice of fish. The Yuzu ice cream we finished our meal off was so delicious! My son had to have it the second night. Both nights our service was super prompt and friendly. Our server happened to over hear me gushing about the braised daikon and brought out little extra prepared daikon to enjoy with my other dishes. I thought that was so kind of him! The atmosphere is really cool. Not intimidating and the tables toward the back remind me of being inside a vineyard. Almost like you are partially enclosed inside a gigantic wine barrel.

We dined on a Saturday night and I started swooning over how cute the seating was - each booth was a giant barrel! Once we settled in, I started noticing that each song that was played almost sounded like it was from my personal spotify playlist - I just felt like it was love at first sight. When our server came, she mentioned that it was happy hour - how could this visit be any more perfect...

We didn't want a heavy meal so we decided to get a few dishes off happy hour and some off their regular menu as well. Our favorites were the tuna carpaccio, oysters, and the hamachi kama.

Where do I start!

What did I get
I get the Edamame, Beef Tataki, Chicken Karaage, Salmon Lovers. 
Edamame was good, nothing special. 
Beef Tataki was not like I expected. I didn't really like it. The beef didn't seem seared and the beef was a bit too cold for my taste. The sauce was good though!
Chicken Karaage WAS THE BEST THING EVER! The chicken was very juicy and tender!! Droollll! I need more! There is a ginger kick to it. IT WAS VERY VERY VERY good! Should've gotten the 12 piece!
Salmon Lover was good as well! A lot of Salmon, there was regular Salmon and Salmon Belly! IT WAS DELICIOUS!

Environment
The restaurant is on a plaza. The inside is really nice. There is the sushi bar on the right and the left side had booth seating. The place is rather dark.... definitely good for a date, which I didn't have... :( Everything was all fancy, just expected of any japanese restaurant these days

Niceness of Staff
Once we walked in it was a bit annoying because no one said anything. Stood there for about 3 minutes before someone decided to seat me. The only bad part was getting them to seat me, otherwise they were great. Placed my order and got my food and it was all good.

Dollar $$
All good Sashimi comes at a price. Definitely good sushi (compared to Orlando FL any sashimi is good honestly....) 

Yes?
Yes yes yes! The chicken was the best! and the salmon was great! The beef tataki I would not get again, other that that everything was great! Not sure if I would explore anything else... the Chicken and Salmon for my stomach!

4331554,2017-11-27,1,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"Wow. Chef Takashi is nothing short of amazing. This restaurant fills up quick - reservations are recommended as they only have a handful of booths (which are quite comfortable) and a few regular tables. You can see the chef's extensive background on a plaque outside of the restaurant. He's been making sushi hungry tummies happy since 1986.

Ordered the Koji special - what a true work of art. The amount of care and thoughtfulness in presentation was absolutely stunning and a great value. The part that stood out the most for me was the mackerel - it had a nice not overpowering marinade to it and I think was slightly charred before presenting - this was the best mackerel I've ever had anywhere. As for the other ingredients, yes they are pretty typical but were of the utmost freshness.

Uni bowl - the uni was super fresh and the portion was fair. It also includes a miso soup and salad.

Karaage - Japanese fried chicken - if you've never had Japanese fried chicken, you're missing out. Lightly breaded and fried but full of flavor.  Won't fill you up as an entree but it makes a great appetizer. 

Udon - we got a plain udon for my 3 year old son and of course I had to try it - yes this was amazing too. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was full of flavor.

The menu had pages and pages of unique rolls created by the chef- unfortunately I was too full to try anything else, but I definitely will next time. 

Overall experience was exceptional - the mistake I made was not making a reservation first. We had to wait a little over half an hour but it was well worth it. If this restaurant had any opportunities, I would say they could use another server. Unfortunately during peak dinner there were really only two people running the whole place. They were very attentive but you could tell they were a bit overwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the service was nothing short of excellent - just that you'd have to catch them as they are literally running across the restaurant!

I also wanted to add that they actually filter their drinking water with an RO system and it tastes amazing. This really goes to show how thoughtful they are, because let's face it - we don't exactly have the best tasting tap water around here. Keep up the good work guys, I'll definitely be back.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,7,1,5,ddqC9u_G7SpkztNhTJqXDg

4401387,2015-12-20,3,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"If you are looking for an AYCE sushi place... keep looking further! Sorry, but this probably won't be the place for AYCE tonight. However, if you're looking for something different *and* Japanese, then you've found the right place. 

Sushi Takashi's AYCE prices are outrageous (I called to ask and it was somewhere like $70-80!) No way, Jose! But fortunately, they do offer a 10 and 12 course meal for a more reasonable price ($29.95 and $39.95 respectively). Perhaps that is why... to steer people away from AYCE!

Anyhow, my dad and I ordered the 12 course meal which was maybe a little much... we had to take a few items home. We could have done with the 10 course meal, but both of us were starving and underestimated the amount of food we could eat. Nonetheless, you do get a big bang for your buck. The food came out at a very consistent pace, though slightly out of order at times. Our server was also very helpful.

Let's began with the food itself, shall we...

Course #1: Edamame (Original / Garlic)
My dad and I ordered two different edamame. I much prefer the garlic flavored one over the original. However, the garlic flavor was quite strong so it may not be your cup of tea if you are looking for a subtle start.

Course #2: Carpaccio (Beef / Salmon)
Both were good but I much prefer the beef carpaccio. 

Course #3: Soba Salad (Grilled Salmon / Grilled Shrimp)
My dad and I ordered the same thing, different topping. This was one of my favorite dishes -- if not THE one favorite dish -- and I would've ordered more of this if I could. Delicious! Hands down, get the grilled salmon. Grilled shrimp was mediocre, and I'm a shrimp lover.

Course #4: Sushi (4pc nigiri)
Nigiri was pretty good. Nothing spectacular and it wasn't the highlight of my meal, but you can tell it wasn't yucky old fish. The sashimi pieces were smooth.

Course #5: Cold Dish (Oyster / Snow Crab)
Both were good! If I had to choose one, I'd probably choose the oysters.

Course #6: Vegetable (Agedashi-Tofu / Sauteed Asparagus)
Tofu tasted old or like it's been sitting out and warmed up. Would definitely prefer the asparagus.

Course #7: Teriyaki (Chicken / Beef)
The beef teriyaki was very dry and tasted a little overcooked, but was flavored so well. The chicken was perfect in every way. I love beef teriyaki normally but this time around I prefer the chicken.

Course #8: Deep fry (Karaage / Tempura)
I don't like deep fried dishes as an overall personal preference... but the karaage was pretty good. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, which says a lot since I don't like deep fried dishes!

Course #9: Beef Dish (Sukiyaki)
So good! A little on the sweeter side than some other place's sukiyaki, but still good. This was actually a lot more food than the previous courses, so I ended up taking this home for next day's lunch. Still good!

Course #10: Special Roll 4pc
You have a choice of ordering one roll from the ""Special Rolls"" section. I ordered the yokohama and it was decent. I preferred the one my dad ordered, which was the steak roll.

Course #11: Soup (Corn & Egg Soup / Miso)
Loved the corn and egg soup and the miso soup was made really well, too.

Course #12: Dessert (Tempura Ice Cream / Shaved Ice)
I absolutely LOVED the tempura ice cream... I would've ordered more if I wasn't already in a food coma by this time. I'm a huge fan of tempura ice cream but for some reason the one here was really the cherry on top of my 12-course meal.",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,9,5,4,LnBJEN6Ad7Rd10kGqnIC8A

After yet another failed attempted of trying to go Raku (which seems to always and forever be booked solid on my trips to Vegas), my dad and I decided to walk over to Takashi instead, since Raku's hour long wait was too much for us (we were pretty hungry). We managed to snag the very last table. We each decided on a course menu - 10 course for me (29$) and 12 course for him (39$). Despite the stellar reviews, I wasn't really expecting my dad to enjoy it (he's the definition of a sushi snob).

But after course after course of incredibly fresh, delicious Japanese goodness (from oysters to sashimi to sushi to soba noodle salad to tempura to soup to dessert), I've found a new all-time favorite that I'll definitely be going to whenever I'm in Vegas. Everything was perfect - the food, the price, and the service. And seeing my dad so enamored by a restaurant (something that happens as often as certain cosmic phenomena, meaning every decade or so) was a rare pleasure. He didn't complain once!

I definitely recommend making reservations if you're going around 7-9pm and want to sit in their cozy booths that make you feel like you're inside a wooden barrel. They had a variety of choices on the menu to choose from. From sashimi, nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked items. You can either do a la carte or pick from a 10 course dinner [$29.99] or 12 course dinner [$39.99] . As well as ayce for $80 which is steep or they had some other cheaper sets as well. The boyfriend and I chose to both do the 12 course. They bring out a piece of paper and for each course you get to choose which item you want from their list. I chose garlic edamame, hamachi w/jalapeño, agedashi tofu, oysters [4 on the halfshell], soba salad with salmon skin [there were soba noodles in it! Pretty interesting], salmon bowl, tempura mix [shrimp and veggies], salmon teriyaki, sukiyaki [noodles, sliced beef, tofu, veggies in hot sweet broth], blue diamond roll, miso soup, and to finish off I had condensed milk shaved ice. I'd definitely recommend this place for someone who's looking for something different. Only thing I'd change is the wait time on food..

4854499,2016-06-08,1,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but there are some things that the restaurant can easily do better. 

First of all, the restaurant has several great value on their set menu. I got the bottomless dinner. By bottomless, it means unlimited refill of salad, rice, and miso soup. This is complemented by carpaccio, hot meat dish (teriyaki, beef, salmon, etc), half roll of my choice, shrimp tempura, miso soup, salad and ice cream! All this for only $22!

First the quality of the food. The rolls were really hit or miss. I don't remember the names but my wife got the two rolls combination and ordered rolls with yellow tail and salmon on salmon. They were drenched with ponzu sauce. OTOH, I had a half spider roll and it was great. 

The other nuances was the food came in the wrong order and we had to keep asking for certain items as they failed to bring them out. I would expect my salad, soup, and appetizer to come first. Instead, I got my rolls first, then my spicy yakiniku, shrimp tempura and rolls. I had to ask to get my soup. I later realized I never got my salad. My wife didn't get her soup or edamame and we had to remind them on separate occasions. It was a bit frustrating.

The only reason I can't give Sushi Takashi 5-stars is that it took over two hours for the 12-course dinner. Matter of fact, we didn't even stick around for the dessert course because the husband got antsy about having been at the restaurant for so long. Bummer because I was looking forward to the tempura ice cream.

The food was great. Can't remember everything I chose, but everything tasted great. No complaint at all. Husband enjoyed his dinner as well. He got one of the dinner combos with chicken teriyaki and a half-roll of the tonkatsu roll, because for 2 people, if one orders the course dinner, the other person has to order something at least $15, which was fine, as we planned on sharing everything.

We set up a reservation for 7pm with Mrs. Robertson for Saturday night and were seated immediately upon arrival. Instead of attempting the 12-course meal again we decided to order a la carte for a new experience. 

We ordered sashimi mostly (salmon, seared salmon, super white tuna), tuna poke bowls, and some small appetizers this time around. Everything showed up promptly and we were attended to consistently throughout the night. We also observed the other tables just to make sure we were not getting special treatment and the other tables around us (there were 3 with 4 people minimum each) happened to be getting the same level of attention and service. The food was delicious, as it was the last time we came. While waiting for our sushi roll head chef Takashi also personally sent us a delicious salmon soup for us to try and it was amazing. It was a soup will come back for next winter to try again because it reminded me of a soup my grandmother used to make me during the winter as a child. 

The most important takeaway I had after the evening are that the people at Sushi Takashi truly care about their business and the experiences that their patrons are having on a nightly basis. While our first experience wasn't amazing they immediately sought out to correct it and through their efforts have earned more respect from me than if I had just a ""good"" or ""okay"" experience the first time around.

Well, for one, you get seated right away and they have great selections to choose from...for a price. I know people out there who love to give bad reviews because a place is ""expensive"" - stay away!

Depending on what you're interested in (cooked entrees, sushi, everything), there's a set for you. For the average AYCE sushi goers, I'd recommend the Takashi's Bottomless Dinner for $23 which includes salad, carpaccio or sashimi, miso soup, cooked entree and a roll. They also have 10-course dinner set and a 12-course dinner set.

But what I always come here for is the Salmon Overflow Bowl. For $30 you get salad, miso soup and lots of salmon sashimi (there's rice underneath all the salmon). If you're a big fan of salmon like I am, this is worth it. I normally get seconds because it is a lot of salmon. 

They have different rolls and nigiri and other items you can order ala carte. The fish is always fresh and the cuts are good.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,14,10,4,r9y2wzpEDfDC6j3l8dE2UQ

The food alone is worth the visit, but the atmosphere is so laid back and welcoming it makes for quite the dining experience. Our waiter was very patient as we scoured the menu, pointing out favorites we might like and instructing us how to fill out the card for the courses we ordered. My oldest went for the curry chicken and loved it. I ordered the 10 course meal and what a feast it was! The standouts were the scallop carpaccio, the salmon bowl, and the soba salad. I ordered the blue diamond roll as part of the 10 courses and it was plentiful, fresh and delicious. The carpaccio was made from the sweetest scallops paired with thinly sliced lemon, masago and a mild ponzu sauce. It was heavenly. The salmon bowl contained thick salmon slices on top of rice. The salmon was not stringy or tough like one might expect of such a plentiful portion. The taste was fresh and sweet, and the next time I visit I may just go for the refillable salmon bowl. The soba salad has a creamy yet light dressing and noodles with the texture of fresh made pasta. The sushi chef was very friendly and it was quite evident he was very passionate about his sushi. The service couldn't have been better, our drinks never went empty. I would recommend reservations as the place is small and often packed, yet is so worth the wait.

5529648,2015-06-09,78,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"The truckload of food that Takashi pushes out for his $40 twelve course dinners make Restaurant Week look like Restaurant Weak.  Seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  Maybe if my car broke down up on Mount Charleston and I walked all the way here would it be possible?  So while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  Even for myself, I find it hard to believe I am complaining about too much food, but I am going there.   

As an example, course plate #4-#8 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage (fried chicken) and then beef sukiyaki.  That's like a mixtape going from Mozart to Slipknot to Whitney Houston to last year's Grammy winning polka artist.  Why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  Who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?  

Something like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but I just looked at it as battles within battles.  The menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the ever-growing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds' sanity vs ""holy shit, we're only on #5??""  A server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that ""He was a Yelper"".  Nice job, Yelper.  Did you go to Home Depot or Lowe's for that attachment? ;)

If you're still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:

#3: Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad: My wife's Soba Salad won.  The dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  You also get a choice of salad topping (grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin).  We both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  Don't load up on potato!  Trust me.  

#6: Oysters vs Snow Crab: It was a TKO by the oysters.   Even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  This would retail for at least $18 elsewhere.  I will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.  
 
#7: Tempura vs Karaage: We barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but I'd go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  Even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.  

Already stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  Would it be OK if I just left my credit card overnight?  I saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  Maybe we could come back in an hour?  That moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.  

#8: Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak:  Bitch, please.  Not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didn't even walk into the ring.  Flawless victory!  The sukiyaki was classic.  It was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semi-fatty beef which made the broth even better.  We asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  This could have been a standalone entrée.  

#9: Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy:  They should get rid of this course altogether.  The doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  No one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  Ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  Lose, lose.

#10: 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl (more rice!) vs Hamburger:  Nigiri won.  It was the smallest portion of food!  Tony T was at another table and got the hamburger which was a FULL HAMBURGER, BUN AND ALL WITH FRIES.  Am I going crazy?  

Some may avoid this spot because their AYCE is $80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, it'll be more about all you can't eat.  There were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  Portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   No one would complain about paying $40 for that.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,86,66,3,O2QXLJYwOBxtoxevRhOxQw

5558024,2015-07-29,2,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"The sashimi here is exceptional.  Finally, a decent Japanese restaurant knows how to prepared sashimi at the proper temperature.    Sashimi is supposed to serve in a very cold temperature, especially in Summer.   

There's plenty of room for improvement.  $40/person for 12 courses are just way too big for one person.  The server should rethink when upselling an additional course.  My friend and I went to this restaurant, we wanted to share the 12 course menu for $39.99. the server told us, we must order one more dish sashimi plate $15.00.  We can't share without ordering this additional dish.  We did just that! 

Whatever the green tea that was served tasted muddy and extremely bitter.  

We ate the following: 
2/5 
the sashimi plate for 2. $15.00
( I spat out a fish bone out of my salmon sashimi.  This is reason the rating is so low on this dish is no bone should ever been in a sashimi plate. I would have given a 4.5-5 with this dish if it weren't for the bone)

2/5
Miso soup: a little thin in taste.  We can barely tasted miso.  The soup in way too thin. 

5/5.  The oyster: it's perfect!!

1/5.  The special roll: king crab. The crab and avocado together tasted bitter after first bite. We stop continue to finish this plate.

4/5. Tofu salad:   It was nicely done. 

5/5 Squid (ika) carpaccio:  it was very well flavored.  We could Barlely continue at this point.  

3.5/5 Sukiyaki: the favor is better than most places,  we were way too stuffed at this point and call it a quit.  Pack the rest home.  

The speed of service was 2/5.  The server doesn't pay any attention to the progress we were making.  The table was too over crowded.  The lack of expediting control in our case.  It came out too fast with a smallest table they can mustered. 

Friendliness: 2.5/5.  
0: Serve food without attentiveness: zombie server or robot servers. 
2.5+/-: -served with smile and quick to response. Rooms for improvements. 
4.5:  Server with a warm heart.  Genuinely courteous. 

 The attentiveness: 1/5.  We have to wave down a server when needed, it takes times to wave down someone for service on a Friday night.   Server should always be one step ahead to observe if the customers need anything, clearing of plates, refill drinks.  We actually have to wave them all down for this service.  Sorry, the servers are not trained properly. 

There are a few things that tasted great here. I would consider returning and may possible update my reviews.",DNxBV9OfvwNkNWZwLCyDkg,1,2,4,SqceYA2g6xgevOc_oeXZ3g
5577286,2016-03-11,3,-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"10-12 Courses Japanese Dinner in Las Vegas. A bit overrated.

The 10 Course Sushi Dinner is $29.95, and the 12 Course Sushi Dinner is $39.95. They come with all kinds of appetizers, entrées, and dessert. They have oyster, edamame, carpaccio, and salad for appetizer. They have teriyaki, tempura, sukiyaki, nigiri sushi, a sushi roll of your choice, etc. for the entrée. Once you decide to order the 10+ course dinner, the waiter will give you a paper and pencil to check off the items you would like to order for each course.

The deal is pretty good, but the food quality is only ok. The service was really slow. They only have 2 waiters to serve the whole restaurant, and sometimes they got frustrated and forgot something. The dessert came first and they forgot my soup. The dinner service itself took a while for 3 hours. While the 10+ course is a good deal, it might not be very suitable for this restaurant, since they only have 2 waiters. 10+ course with one dish at a time requires a lot of man power and legwork.

It consist of varieties of baked, steamed, raw, grilled, fried traditional Japanese dishes.
I highly recommend the oyster, uni, and seasonal fresh fish that chef recommends.  The price is reasonable as they only opened for a month and half.  I'm sure pretty soon there will be a line waiting at the door.  Thumbs up with five stars!",X339TgJNbDrB-SuMqcnc5Q,2,1,5,C2y9Jk1nLdJYNJXa0cTirw

4 piece nigiri 
Miso soup 
Sautéed asparagus

All of this for only $29.95!! Fantastic deal ! Everything was so yummy! I'm like drooling thinking about the meal right now. The fish was fresh and the cuts are fairly big! Definitely try the Steak Roll if you are down to try something new! It was surprisingly really good better than the other rolls my group ordered.

I ordered the uni (sea urchin), yellowtail carpaccio, oysters, miso soup, miso salmon, tuna poki, gyoza, and much more. Let me start off by saying how great the quality was for their fish. I don't usually splurge on sushi, since I like to get my money's worth and just settle for ayce sushi instead. But this place is definitely worth it! They have lots of different options of raw foods & cooked foods. They also had an AYCD (all you can drink) for $15 a person! Not bad at all... I thought there was worth your money. Unfortunately, we got in a bit too late for that.
