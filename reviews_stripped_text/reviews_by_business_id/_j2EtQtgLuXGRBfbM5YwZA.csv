7038,2011-04-25,0,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"I suppose Noodle Asia fist the mold of the late night ""fill-me-up"" food, which people seek after a night of drinking in Las Vegas.  Maybe I ate here at the wrong time, totally sober, and fresh off of the airplane.  My hunger was satisfied, and I must have liked it to a degree, as my plate was pretty much clean, but reflecting back on it, my experience was simply, ok.  

There was a total of 6 guys that I went with, and we each got different things, so I was able to sample a couple of things other than what I'd ordered.  Shanghai Noodles was my choice.  It's a dish of wok-fried noodles with napa cabbage and pork.  The plate looked and smelled good, but the noodles were truly too oily.  I honestly couldn't help but think of Michael Jackson's 1980's jheri curl, so I suppose I can say that the noodles were straight up greasy.  However, one of the guys at my table got beef congee.  It had that nice thick porridgey texture that I love, not watery, as I've experienced at too many other establishments.  Also, the beef was tender, which I previously thought was impossible in a soup.  

Though the noodles, their flagship product, aren't my favorite, I can say that they had excellent service.   We were seated immediately, and almost as soon as we sat down, water was at our place settings.  Additionally, time between placing our order, and when the first dish was delivered, was relatively quick, and when it arrived to the table, it was piping hot.  It is one of the ""casual"" dining spots in The Venetian, so don't expect a meal to write home about.  However, as I hinted earlier, if you're in need of balancing your liquid-to-solid ratio, after boozing, then head on over there.",9QrE24JaemD3TLFihmTKxg,0,0,3,_y4M_SwRqSIvYAQZdDsc3Q

31880,2009-01-20,1,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"I usually get comp rooms at the Venetian/Palazzo so I typically gamble long hours at these 2 places. I have eaten at Noodles Asia a few times due to it being a chinese restaurant and also getting comped food from the pit boss. 

First time I asked for a comp for 2, pit boss told me that I had $86 to blow at Noodles Asia. I was floored! I never eaten here before and was wondering how 2 people can spend $86 in a chinese restaurant, when we did not plan on ordering Shark's Fin, Abalone, Bird's Nest, Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, Sea Cucumber, you know the drill. 

But Yes We Can, at Noodles Asia apparently. The food isn't great, heck, I would go to Ping Pang Pong over at Gold Coast over this place anyday. But I absolutely adore the fact that they have Chicken Mushroom Ginger Soup. Oh this is the reason why I go there. The rest are just for formality. Dim dum mediocre, Fried Rice Oily, Noodles not asian enough. 

In fact, last Saturday, I got drunk playing Baccarat at MGM HL room and got back to the Venetian and decided to have one bowl of soup. Sure it costs $10.95, sure it's still not that good, but it is to me the best item on this menu, and that is good enough reason for me to keep coming back.

For better dim sum and chinese food in general, head over to Bellagio's Noodles if you want a casino setting, or Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast. Otherwise head over to Chinatown",EzlY772Tcmyky4YFWabLug,1,0,3,ga-16hSSL3TPWS3nofPjUg

If you're looking for good authentic Asian food in the Venetian in Vegas, this is your place.  However, like many of the very authentic Asian restaurants, the service was completely lacking.  Our waitress visited our table only twice, once to take our order and the second time to bring the bill.  Otherwise a server brought our food, and no stopped by again to ask if we needed anything else. 

I tired to send back a plate because it wasn't what I wanted, and the hostess essentially told me ""no"", because they'd through the food away and it'd be wasted... so I just kept it and ate, but after a few more bites it wasn't all that bad after all  :-)

I agree with others who enjoyed the spicy Szechwan (sp?) beef noodle soup. I don't usually like star anise flavoring, but they did a great job with the broth, definitely slurp-worthy. 
The other dish was pan-fried noodles with seafood, which was generic in a good solid way. Nothing to rave about, but tasty. You might try topping it off with the red vinegar and some chili sauce to give it some kick.
We also tried the potstickers and the shu mai. I liked the filling for the potstickers, but the shu mai I thought was just so-so.
The service was fine, but I got the sense that the management doesn't necessarily stress the usual tenets of customer service in the ""American"" sense, so I'm not surprised by some of the complaints recorded in other reviews.

PROS:

1. Food- full of flavor and seemed fresh.  They offered a good selection of entrees.
2. Staff- friendly and somewhat fast service.
3. Ambience- not too upscale, not rundown, but juuuust right.
4. Value- It's Vegas and the Venetian! Lol, but considering that, it wasn't too pricey.
5. Hours- I loved this place because it's one of the restaurants that close the latest.  Afterall, it is Vegas and you don't want dinner too late in the morning lol.  By the way, they usually close at 3 a.m.

CONS:

1. Location- If you're not staying at the Venetian, it will be a little hike to get to the restaurant, but it might just be worth it (especially if you love Chinese food).
2. Pricing- I mentioned it above, but if you're looking for a low-cost meal, this isn't the place to go to.  You'll probably spend around $50-$100 for a full course meal for two (including tip and depending on how inebriated you might be).",pniN_cGRrzrosDzcT4WsUw,1,0,4,50xVjvqYcRMs3w6hA0-wHw

It's inside of the Venetian (in the casino by the slot machines) so it's worth it if you're really craving a quick bowl of noodle soup and don't want to make the trip to Chinatown. It's a little pricey-the noodle soups will run you about $15 per bowl, but you're paying for the convenience of the location. Ambiance is nice and casual. It's open to the casino and you can see/hear the slot machines going.

Food: It's okay, nothing spectacular. Been here a bunch of times and always get the same dishes: wonton noodle soup, Cantonese beef stew, veggies. Usually everything tastes fine, but on this last visit the broths were very bland, almost tasteless.

Service: Surprisingly subpar for a restaurant located inside of the Venetian. In the past it's been quick and decent, so maybe they were just having an off day. I can certainly understand service being a little slow when it's super busy. But this last visit to Noodle Asia was not during a rush, maybe about 8 tables were full. Service was very very slow. Asked for some extra chopsticks and had a pair LITERALLY thrown onto the table by the waiter who couldn't bother to walk an extra foot.

Are you serious? I wouldn't go back here even if I was desperate for food after a night out of drinking and dancing. This place was disgusting. I wish I can give this place several negative stars. I bet prison food probably tastes better than what these people are trying to conjure up. 

The service sucked, the sprite or 7up was watered down, food was gross and it was expensive. The service was slow, drinks weren't refilled, they didn't check on you once to ask you how everything was, you have to wave many times to get someone's attention for the check (get me the hell outta there ASAP!), even though I said that the soda tastes weird (I had a cold mind you but I could still taste how there wasn't enough syrup) and that the syrup was probably low, it didn't matter because the drink lady sure didn't change it or care and I couldn't understand what the hell words was coming out of her mouth. Maybe I should have tried to speak in her native tongue and we could have gotten somewhere. 

The food was so bland and oily. I've made better soup the first time I attempted to make it and I'm no cook either! The chicken soup with veggies (forgot what it was called but it was one of the more expensive ones per the server's suggestion) was mainly water broth, noodles, and veggies all thrown into a bowl. I should have known something was up when the only things on the table spruce up the food was soy sauce and chili paste. Seriously? We also ordered the beef stir-fry noodle which was also tasteless. The beef, however was tender and good. Why does it have to be so OILY though? To try and mask their terrible attempt at Asian cuisine? 

Don't be duped into going here just because the people that work there (yes, including the cooks) were Asian like we were! Seriously, $40 for bland soup and chowfun? I was starving and I still couldn't force myself to finish 3 bites of the soup. I seriously contemplated on sticking a note on their menu that's outside their restaurant to warn potential customers of their business. (shaking head with arms crossed) Boo and shame on you Noodle Asia! )=P `~

In between all the fine dining, it's nice being able to escape from the Vegas bustle by not having to leave the Strip and cozy up to simple nostalgic home dishes.

Szechwan beef soup is a traditional favorite of mine with the broth having the right amount of spice flavor and heat. The beef is tender and the noodles are on point being chewy and soft. 

The fish filet congee is another comfort food. The fish is delicate and congee is cooked well. Personally, I wish there was more fish and this requires a couple dashes of salt, but after doing so at the table, it is perfect.

Unlike typical Chinese restaurants, traditional Chinese cooking at home doesn't drown the dish with oils, sauce, and salt which is why Noodle Asia brings such comfort to me.",1pOj4zJ5pt6KlCXtdG3NQQ,0,0,4,kmGJiEAdFgwUUhAKsX5RKA

The main problem we had with the restaurant was how we were charged extra for a side order. To explain, my dad ordered a beef stew noodle ($14) that was a reasonable portion, but the noodle-to-beef ratio was off so we ordered a side of beef. 

I was shocked when the bill came and the small side of beef stew was $20. Whoa mama wtf is disssss!! We even tried to look on the menu but nowhere did it say beef stew by itself was $20, it seem like we were paying for a'la carte. The side was absolutely not $20 (perhaps $10 for a small dish).

food is 75% of what i care about, so this place is a 3.5 stars for me.  the next time i'm in Vegas with a growling belly for noodles, i'll push my way through crowds of tourists in 100+ degree heat to get here.  for this reason, and since i can only give integer star ratings, i'll round up to a 4.  i am not factoring in the cost.

it was the last day that the fam and i were in town, and we had to find a quick place to eat before returning the rental car and heading off to the airport.  being chinese, we had a Hong Kong noodle craving, and after agonizing at the greater-than-50% price markup on familiar dishes (compared with tried and true manhattan chinatown prices), we sat down to order four dishes to share:

1.  cantonese beef stew (noodle soup) $11.95
2.  BBQ pork and roast duck (noodle soup) $19.95 
3.  Beef rice noodles (wok-tossed noodle) $14.95
4.  Singapore mei fun (wok-tossed noodle) $13.95

we expected the worst, and were pleasantly surprised.  the dishes are all very large, so its best to share/eat family style.  the noodles soups were tasty, with generous porions of BBQ pork and duck pieces.  the wok-tossed noodles were surprisingly authentic-- the Beef rice noodles had a good flavor and the noodles were long and intact, and the pieces of beef were very large.  the singapore noodles were had just the right spice.   

can't vouch for the other foodstuffs, but what i had was good and i would go again.  cost is reasonable for the area and the convenience if you're already at The Venetian.",gPIj18Mm0fem7WkMuA4A0g,1,1,4,Y-5tXkv9cmcRvXKc_QHWcA

In the biggest hotel in the world with 39 restaurants, this should be your last choice.
The ambient is terrible: really bright lights, a high ceiling and a really open space reminds me of a mess hall from a outpost. The windows are really big and the restaurant partially open, which makes you feel like in a shop window and exposed. The noise from the Cassino mixes up with the noise from the kitchen.

The menu is out of laminated paper: compared to leather covers from the other 29 restaurants, it looks cheap.

The service is friendly but does not talk fluent English. The food gets thrown to your table in less than 5 min after ordering: it was pre-cooked!

The taste of the food is terrible. A lot of grease, duck with feathers yet and no spices at all on the food. Did I mentioned greasy??

The value for money is absence, since I can get a great spaghetti with sea food for the same price in at least three other restaurants in the resort.

757385,2013-12-29,3,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"4 stars for the Beef Noodle Soup. Minus 1 star for service.

FOOD (4/5):
- Chicken Noodle Soup: Organic chicken with soup, goji and noodles-- can't go too wrong. The broth was clear, hot and very qing. The chicken wasn't very flavorful, but that's what I expected from this type of soup.  We asked for extra noodles, which was an additional $3.  ($13 + $3 for extra noodles)
- Beef Noodle Soup:  Very good!  Definitely the best part of the meal was eating a hot bowl of beef noodle soup filled with steamy broth, niu rou and the tendon.  It was cooked very well and the noodles were cooked al dente. I think they gave some of the sour veggies on top, which was yummy as well.  ($13)
- Pho:  I didn't try it, but the price was a whopping $15-17! (I forget the exact price.)

SERVICE (3/5):  I'm a little surprised that Noodle Asia had a hostess who didn't know a lick of English. She had asked us to clear some space in the front and she said, ""Back to go.""  We didn't understand what she wanted and she seemed very flustered and angry (at herself?).  When a few people came to the front to ask how long the wait was, she didn't seem like she wanted to answer because they had asked in English.  The service in the restaurant wasn't too great either-- it was exactly what I had expected from a Chinese restaurant. However, since we were paying an arm and a leg for something that typically costs $6-8 in California, and since we were in Las Vegas, I was expecting better service.  At least some refill on tea and water... but we didn't get any of that type of service, and we got the same ""rushed, stony-faced, no 'thank you'"" service that we got at Sam Woo (in Chinatown). Haha.  I would still come back though. The venue and service are nothing to write home about, but the beef noodle soup definitely hit the spot for me.

WAIT:  We wanted for about 20 minutes and there were about 7 parties ahead of us. The good thing is that the line moved decently fast-- people get their noodles and dishes quickly, chomp it down, and then leave for more Vegas fun.  When I called at 12 pm, the person who picked up the phone said the wait was 1 hour.  O_O

Went here because some Yelpers said it was a decent Chinese place on the strip. Repeat, the strip.

First off, the location sucks. Yes, it may be in the Venetian, but it's in some odd corner where the smell of smoke is intense and you're looking at nothing but Sportsbooks.

We were seated promptly but it took about half an hour for water and menus. The food was honestly forgettable. Yes, there was variety, as well as Dim Sum, and the quality of ingredients was good, but it didn't live up to its claim of authenticity, nor did it taste spectacular. We had the XO Shrimp and the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles. And it was overpriced as hell.

Like I said, you're better off eating at Panda Express somewhere in Henderson, or in Vegas if there is one. Sure it's a chain, but the food is freshly made, hot, and tasty.

Two stars for bad environment, mediocre food, and slow service.

The broth for the spicy noodles was tasty, but I much prefer the noodles in the beef noodle soup.  We also had an order of the shrimp shumai which was also excellent.

We had the Hot and Sour soup, Beef fried rice, and the BBQ Pork and Duck.

The Hot and Sour soup was pretty good, tasted like all the other chain Chinese restaurants here in Canada.

The Beef fried rice was also pretty good, well seasoned, nice beef taste

The BBQ Pork and Duck I was very disappointed with.
The first bite I took was greeted with a million sharp shards of bones. Both the Pork and Duck were really dry, and of course served with some even drier rice.  Another problem is the rice to meat ratio. You can tell this restaurant does not care about details or quality when they just shoved about 3 bowls of rice onto a plate topped with a couple pieces of meat. I'm not complaining about the meat, I would have rather they  not give me a bunch of rice which I am not going to eat. I am Asian and when you eat meat with your rice you usually take a bite of the meat, and a spoonful of rice. Well that's what I did (the meat and rice were very dry I had to drink a cup of water after each bite) and I did not even finish half the rice, not even a quarter.

Very disappointed, wasn't worth the 30 minute line outside for food I could have gotten at a chain Chinese restaurant.",qWi9rLzY-5ytyUBglzgiKQ,2,0,2,k2nqVZ0Pqogf8CQX8BInxw

Of course, I've had my share of coming here at 2am on Saturday nights and I usually end up going with my default, the beef noodle soup, but this time around I went for lunch and actually got to try a bunch of different items from the menu.

First the beef noodle soup is good.  It has a good amount of kick and the brisket has been braised long enough so it's tender.  Portion's a little small but it is always satisfying.

If you like rice, YangChow fried rice is the way to gooo.  You can definitely tell that it's been wok-ed in a super hot wok and oil glistens on every rice kernel.  Lots of BBQ pork and diced veggies.  You can even make it spicy if you request it!

As for other noodles, black pepper beef udon is great if you love peppery flavors.  It's not black pepper sauce that you see from most cafes in LA but actual cracked black pepper.  Shanghai noodles has a little bit of curry powder in it and loaded with shrimp and other goodies.  Of course can't go wrong with the wonton soup either.  

For me, I'm just really surprised at how... authentic or as authentic as it can be.  I mean, it sits right next to the casino and the sports book.  Usually spots like these are reserved for a crappy deli or something.  Definitely nice to have something like this when you've had Grand Luxe so many times!

Wait time is little to nothing to get seated and also the food gets prepped fast. So if you're really hungry go there you'll be happy. 

The food is good. If you're big on iced tea and boba they got it so that'll make you happy. 

The food is my gripe. So it's not terribly expensive compared to other things on the strip but the meat had tons of bone which made the food look bigger even though it wasn't.

Moving along.. We got our check and paid. They never gave us our change. It was so hard to get their attention because they kept avoiding our table and looking away. Finally we flagged someone down and asked for our change. They assumed the change was tip. Ok a restaurant should never assume the change is tip. You can't just keep a customer's change without asking. And we didn't even leave enough for it to be considered tip.... Anyway we were very upset because the service was just really bad.

The service -- now on multiple occasions -- has been so bad, I had to take off one star. But imagine how good it is if I'm giving four stars for some of the worst service I've ever experienced!

Yes, it really is that good.

The funny story in all of this is that my wife and I were just wandering around looking for some breakfast on a lazy Saturday morning. Heavy breakfast at the Grand Lux? No thanks. Walk down to White Castle? Too far and too lazy. Then we saw the sign for Noodle Asia and thought that the idea of fried rice and pot stickers for breakfast sounded great! But when we walked up to the restaurant, we found out that it didn't open until 11 a.m. It was 10:30. So we sat down at a slot, lost $40, and then jumped up as others appeared ready to go to Noodle Asia.

First in line, we were ready to eat. We were seated. And then...nothing. Others had their orders taken but we just sat. And sat. And sat. As food started coming out for others, our order was finally taken, just seconds before we were going to get up and leave. Then others were seated, their orders were taken, and their food was served. We still had nothing.

It wouldn't have been so bad if we hadn't had two cups of hot and sour soup. How hard would it be to simply ladle the soup into a cup and bring it to us?

The problem is that this isn't the first time we have received this treatment at Noodle Asia. On our previous trip to Las Vegas, we had another situation in which we were seated, and after 20 minutes, we got up and left. We actually asked two servers if our order could be taken and they said that they would be right back. But still, nothing.

Once the food arrived, however, it was all worth it. The hot and sour soup was, well, hot AND sour. What a concept! We also ordered the Night Market Fried Rice, which was a fried rice with sliced beef, Thai chilies, bean sprouts, basil, and diced tomatoes. Don't believe the menu that claims that this rice is spicy, but it is incredibly flavorful. The basil flavor lingers throughout each bite and the sliced beef is tender and delicious.

The Pot Stickers were the clear winner of the day. The dough is not that super-thin, frozen pot sticker style. Instead, it is thicker, creating a great crust where it was pan fried, but leaving a nice bite through the rest of the dough. The pork inside has a wonderfully light ginger flavor. I added a touch of what appeared to simply be soy sauce with green onions as well as some chili paste to give it a little kick. The result was a flavor explosion in my mouth that I have never tasted before. These are a must order.

We also tried the Red Won Tons, which were not quite as successful. These, which were also listed as spicy on the menu but were not, had pork fillings and were tossed in Szechwan Hung Yao chili and presented in garlic sauce. The pork tasted similar to the pork in the pot stickers, but the garlic sauce was incredibly oily and tasted almost burned, ending with an unpleasant texture and taste in my mouth.

But it was well worth it. And that was just the basics. I can't wait to get back and try some more!",eThMCu5Ipzi0L-Xs-lMhbw,1,0,4,QkT53ecZAT6AZo9J6NhrSg

Had come here with an open mind and left disgruntled and frustrated.

First off, the waitress was very sassy and aggressive in tone. Had asked her about some of the items on the menu and she answered in a tone that suggested that I should already know!!! I do not work here so it would be very nice of you, as the waitress, to help me understand. Additionally, my lady had asked about getting some steamed rice and this waitress acted liked she had asked for her soul! IS IT REALLY A BIG DEAL TO ASK FOR A 2 SIDES OF RICE!!! REALLY!!! This waitress clearly needed some time off of work or something because she was dropping the ball for her team and this business!!!

Secondly, the eating utensils were not clean at all! Ewww, do you really expect me to use these dirty utensils to eat my food with! I am not a fan of bacteria and to think that it was appropriate to put these out on the table is just foolish! Luckily, I know how to use chopsticks but this is just not okay at all. I felt bad for the all the other customers that did not inspect there silverware! 

The food was alright! I was just more let down but to fact that I had such an awful waitress. 

Side note, I had some family friends come out to Vegas while I was there and they also ate at this same restaurant and had the same sentiments. They had bad customer service as well and had issues with their order as well. 

I would like to give this place another chance but this disaster that took place while I was here needs to be addressed at some point.

They were out of flat rice noodle, therefore the server recommended the si jiu beef noodles.  The beef and sauce are poured over a bed of crispy thin egg noodles.  This is generally a good dish, and this one was not bad at all.  The beef was very tender, and I liked the noodles once they absorb the sauce.

The combination fried rice was just OK.  It tasted fine, yet something was very plain about it.  I had to add hot sauce so it wouldn't be so boring.  Instead of having slices of meat, some of the meat was shaped in little rectangles, making it seem very cheap.

It's a great place for a quick casual meal or late night snack.  I am not Cantonese so, I can't speculate on how authentic it is but here is what I do when I am eating at an ethnic place.  Who works there?  All Chinese, check.  Who are the cooks?  All look like seasoned veterans, check.  Who eats there?  Many Asians, check.  Passes my test for authenticity.

It's a functional place with some counter space next to the open kitchen and utilitarian tables. Service can be uneven.  I have read other reviews about service neglect but personally I have not experienced what I would consider service neglect in more than half a dozen visit.

Appetizers are overpriced, (I know I said I would try to not to mention price) especially dim sum stuff.  I still love the potstickers.  Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce makes it a nice vegetable side dish.  Hot and sour soup definitely hits the spot every time.

We paid less than $10 for the ""bowl"" size and honestly, it was big enough to fill us both up for the night. While it took awhile for them to get the soup to us (it was pretty busy), the workers were still pretty attentive and helpful to us, even if we were hanging out outside.

The soup itself? DELICIOUS. It was exactly what we needed to comfort us after a long day.

Noodle Asia is located on the casino floor of the Venetian Hotel and there is usually a line to get in. I think I might have been a little early for any crowds.

I ordered the shrimp shu mai which were now and always have been as good as they can get. Just enough filling to wrapper ration and incredible seasoning. 

Then for me the piece de resistance. The dish that I always crave when I am away from Las Vegas and that I crave again the next day after I have it. The Szechuan Beef and Noodle Soup. The broth can be customized to your taste. Anywhere from mild to very spicy. I chose medium. The broth is incredible. So very tasty that I have trouble not finishing it before I eat anything else in the bowl. Then there are the noodles. Fresh, medium thickness. Cooked to the perfect doneness. But the crown jewel of the dish is the beef. Six or seven huge pieces of beef that literally melt in your mouth. The soup is a combination of flavors that is perfect and hard to find so perfectly blended together.

We checked into the Venetian around lunchtime, so by the time we were settled in our room we were quite hungry.  I had looked at the dining book in the room and I saw that Noodle Asia had vegetarian dishes, so we decided to go there.

There was an extremely long wait to get seated - and there were only three parties ahead of ours (one of which had 6 people, the others were couples).  It also took a very long time to get anything to drink and to have our order taken; this was at lunchtime so perhaps they were understaffed.  Fortunately the food arrived quickly after we ordered it, and when we were ready to leave, my doggie bag was brought quickly.

I was quite disappointed in the food, however.  When a restaurant is specifically advertised as having multiple vegetarian dishes, I expect them to be either marked with an icon or in their own section - but here, I had to ask the hostess to explain what dishes on the menu were vegetarian.  There were not many of them, although she claimed that a few could be ""made vegetarian"" by leaving out meat.  (I am always skeptical of this, because very often they use beef broth anyway.)  I ordered the Buddha's Feast noodles and my partner ordered the Shanghai Noodles; hers were much better than mine.

The atmosphere at Noodle Asia is not good at all.  It's mostly sheltered from the casino, but wide-open to the sports book.  I did not enjoy staring at 87 TV's showing all kinds of sports while I ate.

Small Cantonese BBQ Plate ( bbq pork only): Even the small could feed quite a few people. Served as rectangular slices, tender, juicy and their sauce was Awesome.

But I must say, I would drive the extra miles and walk the extra steps from the self park or valet, to have Noodle Asia's bbq pork any day!! One of the best I've had! 

Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice: I love the fact that it Comes with Egg Whites. They also add really thin slices of chinese broccoli that gives the dish a little snap to it. Not only does this simple dish have tremendous flavor, nice soft and crunch texture, it was visually appealing!! (Think X'mas Fried rice: White Rice, like snow.. Chinese sausage, red in color.. Chinese broccoli, green in color..) One of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had! By the way I'm Filipino, I live off rice and have had Many Many different variations of it..

Hong Kong Wonton: Broth very light flavor, noodles thin (like angel hair pasta) and wontons are typical but satisfying. A nice way to start off a meal. 

ordered once:

Roast Duck: rich duck flavor, meat's consistency like chicken and skin abosorbed the sauce. Tasty!

Szechwan Beef noodle soup: dark clear broth, had a spicy note to it but did not linger. Beef were cut into good sized cubes, meat soaked in the wonderful broth flavors and were filling. Thick noodles went perfect with the meat.

About 10 mins later, another waiter came and asked if everything was okay. ""No, it wasn't. Where's my noodles?"" They went back to check on the noodles only to find it not put in to the system again. The waiter asked another waiter and then they finally came to double check on my order and write that s*** down.

If im paying double digits on this. I best see you serve it in a pineapple to show me that your not using CANS!? The only choice that was decent was the beef stew with noodles. It definitely needs a little veg on the side though.. I don't mean to bash on them. I mean. I have to say they are crazy smart to open a fast food Asian cuisine that charges the same price as an upscale Asian fusion restaurants in NYC. Props to them for banking it.

Best of all, portions were large enough for the 3 adults and two teens to share family style and we were stuffed with a little leftovers at the end.  And for The Strip, prices were very reasonable - most in the $13-17 range so with beverages (two of them alcoholic) the bill for the 5 of us was under $100 (not including tip.) Practically unheard of on the strip for in-hotel semi-upscale dining.  Service was good too, although the place was only about 1/3 full when we ate there so YMMV.

When in Las Vegas and you don't feel like spending a ton of money on buffets, you can always fall back on Noodle Asia. Tucked in the back of the Venetian next to the sports betting area, you can certainly grab some cheaper fare, but it's still a bit pricey overall.

I had a bowl of the spicy beef noodle soup (~$15-$16), but it was only a-okay. Beef was all the tendon pieces, so there was actually very little pieces of ""meat."" The broth was also incredibly oily, so I wouldn't recommend this dish if you have an overly sensitive stomach. The noodles themselves were great though - I thought they were a good chewy consistency, but they were drowned out by the ""average-ness"" of the broth and the sub-par beef cuts.

Service (3/5)
Nothing crazy here. It's traditional wait staff, but they're SUPER attentive in filling up your water, so that was nice.

Atmosphere (4/5)
Noodle Asia goes ALL OUT on the ""Chinese"" decor. Red color abounds the dining area, and ginormous versions of traditional Chinese charms adorn the walls.

What's super cool about Noodle Asia is the floor-to-ceiling glass windows so you can have a great view to the sports betting area (aka: the jumbo-sized screens showing all the latest sports games). It's almost like getting front-row seats to the betting area but without spending the $$$ to get a spot.

Overall, Noodle Asia is only okay. It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst. It's a much needed reprieve from Vegas's $50 buffets in terms of dollar savings and not over-indulging in gluttony. Honestly though, I'm not sure if I'd come back since there are way too many delicious food options on The Strip but it's definitely a convenient restaurant option if you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo.",JxklfrIB0SvFLQNGLDPunA,5,4,3,zbllSxCrdnkEPovQNsk9OA

The great thing about Noodle Asia is the good selection of dishes, they bring your food out quickly, and the food just reminded me of a good home-cooked meal. I'm not claiming that the food is super authentic Chinese food, but it's definitely a few steps above Panda Express or any other fast-food Chinese establishment.

The dishes ranged from rice dishes, a couple of dim sum options, moo shu, rice porridge, to noodle soups, wok-tossed noodles, and soups. With two, you should order at least two dishes, with each dish around $12-16.

The shu mai and har gow are fantastic.  I usually get a beef dish over rice (can't think of the name) that is my favorite.  The service is very fast.

I have eaten here at least 10 times and never had a sub-par experience so I would have to say they are very consistent.

I moan, I cry, I feel like I could die without...

Another visit to the Las Vegas pig-out-on-authentic-Chinese-cuisine-slice-of-Heaven that has spoiled me for any other Chinese food in existence. My partner found it during one of his business trips to LV and took me for dinner the very next time we vacationed there. We've been to Sin City six times, and four out of those six, we had most of our lunches and many dinners here at Noodle Asia in the Venetian.

It's not a very big place at all, and if you didn't know what to look for you'd probably just assume that it's another one of those chain places like Panda Bowl and pass it right by.

And if you did that, friend, you were dead wrong. Next time, back it up and go in. It's the gastronomic equivalent of putting a quarter in the Wheel Of Fortune machine and hitting the Grand Prize.

Everything is light, crispy, fresh and always served piping hot. I tend to judge any Chinese place by the quality of their egg and spring rolls, and Noodle Asia's are the kind I wish I could have shipped to my home by the dozen. Not heavy, greasy or stuffy as the more conventional egg rolls, I could just keep ordering these for the entire meal.

And then the sesame peanut noodles. My GOD. Is it dessert, or is it dinner? One mouthful, and it doesn't even matter any more. Is it possible for your tongue to have multiple orgasms? I'm pretty sure mine did. 

Sadly, it's been a couple of years or more since our last LV visit, and I've had dreams about eating at Noodle Asia (oh, yeah, I got it THAT bad.) I've never been a real big seafood fanatic, but I'm pretty sure that those dishes are as awesome as everything else they have, and if I'm lucky, I may get to find out someday.

Meanwhile, if and when you stop by this wonderful place, can you find a way to sneak some spring rolls back to me? I'd be forever in your debt...

But creatures of habit as we are, we always stick to the same dishes... can't miss right.  And they're always excellent.  

Spicy Scezchuan beef soup... it's got some serious kick but so flavorful.  Yes spicy, but with the proper ratio of flavors.  

Pai Goo noodles, which is basically a pork chop with noodles... Simple, tasty, and very fresh.

Spicy cucumbers... accompaniment of some fresh veggies.

Congee... all very tasty.  Again, comfort food with great flavors.

All the above tend to be on the somewhat lighter, brothy side.  Would love to try some of the other dishes, like any of the fried noodles.  And yes, as the name implies why wouldn't i?  Well, bc it's all pretty damn greasy and as tasty as that may sound, and as much as i like not having to put on any lip gloss, it's just all way too heavy.

Service was solid, not 5 star Fancy LV restaurant, but yunno, it's a $13/bowl of noodle level of service.

They open until 3am, so a great place to unwind with some fantastic Chinese comfort food after a long day doing whatever that you were doing. At a reasonable price too. 
The food reminds me of my days in Hong Kong.
My favorite there are
1.Fried Pork Chop Noodle
2.Fried Chicken Wing,. they say it is spicy hot, it really it is not, unless you eat the hot pepper slices that garnish the dish. The wing itself is delicious, but the last order I had during the rush hours was over fried. 
3. Won Ton Noodle Soup
One thing to keep in mind while visiting this place is Noodle Asia is a casual noodle, chinese snack restaurant, kind of like an eat and run cafe. 
The quality of the above are more often above average than not. 
The location is just fantastic too.  It is right next to the sport book section of Venetian. It has a huge glass wall dividing the two, which means that you can eat your noodle, view your favorite sporting event, WITHOUT the smoke and noise that associates a normal sport booking location. What is not to like.

Are you in the middle of the Western US desert, at one of the most heavily touristed venues in the world?

All told it's remarkable that you can get a totally legit bowl of noodles (for your first visit, have the Szechuan Beef Noodle, it's perfectly delicious) up until 3am, right at the Venetian.

Being that I was told that Kevin Wu, the proprietor of the original Royal Star Dim Sum seafood restaurant in the Venetian, was the creator of Noodle Asia, I got excited being that for more than half a decade, I frequented Royal Star in both Santa Monica as well as in the Venetian before it closed its doors.

NO DIM SUM.  PHOOEY.
But alas, when I arrived, there was barely any Dim Sum available.  It seems that nothing more is available other than rice & noodle dishes.  I'm not even going to go through any of the dishes I've ordered over the visits I've had there because... well, you're not really gonna go here for the food.  You're gonna go here if you want something of reasonable quality QUICKLY and at a good price.

GREAT FOR GRINDERS:
Here's the menu:
http://www.venetian.com/uploadedFiles/The_Venetian/Dining/Casual_Dining/noodleAsia.pdf 
I would describe the cuisine here as more ""filling"" that ""delicious"".  If you're in the Venetian Poker Room and need to carb up quickly, this is a great place to get served quickly, shovel down some food that's very edible, pay the bill, and get back to the next sit-and-go.

RELATIVELY CHEAP:
And if you're on a budget or you're a cheap assed Blackjack player, Noodle Asia is likely a great place to get filled up on reasonably priced food - relative to typical Vegas restaurants in a 4-star hotel.  
...But for an amazing gastronomical experience, the dim sum are way, way, WAY tastier & better presented at Woo (at the Palazzo), albeit at prices 3x more expensive.

CONCLUSION:
Average food in good quantity at prices to match.

In one year, there were over 100 servers or busers got the job and quit, Why? Bad management! Does a server care to give good customer service when he/she does not feel love from the company? Who care to give a F when they are only consider as a Workers? Here comes a true story, it was the first day for a new buser, after over 4 hours non stop working, time for him to take a break and dinner, he found a dish of fried rice sat in the kichen for over 2 hours due to a special order made wrong, he microwaved it and started eating since only 30 mins break time. The manager on duty found that out, she gave the buser two options: pay for the dish and keep the job, or take the uniform off and leave immediately because he was violating the rule.

I still love how nearly every server is Chinese and their English is not so great. That gives it high marks in the authenticity column.  But then, the mix of dishes they have (hence the Asia in the name, as opposed to China), make it so that they do a lot of things decently, but seemingly none of them super well.  (You know, jack of all trades, master of none, kinda thing).  

Being a white girl (and a pale, blonde white girl at that), I feel I have to hyperbolically express how spicy I would like dishes at Asian restaurants, so that they're the normal spice of Asian restaurants. I asked our server if the Ma Po Tofu (very authentic dish I love) is spicy.  She said she didn't know as she doesn't like spicy dishes. It was not spicy, it lacked the Ma La the it should have, and it was fairly bland. Disappointed. The only 'spicy sauce they have if you ask for any is chili oil.

Agree with the others below that this place is probably the only legit Chinese food spot on the strip. The lines can be long but they move fast. The staff and cooks are also Asian so they move fast but don't expect a bunch of wasted chit chat. Just order your noodles and chow down. 

The infamous szechaun beef noodle soup is really on point. Deep, rich and with a slight heat, the beef has got tendon and all. Soft. The noodles are tender, perhaps slightly overdone. But the flavors are thoroughly satisfying. The char sui (BBQ pork) is a bit fatty and they swipe on a different sauce than usual. The dan dan noodles are more peanut and less spicy than most. Just add hit sauce. 

Overall, being smack dab in the Venetian on the strip, the prices are slightly more but given the absolute dearth of reasonably good and not outrageously priced Chinese food, this is your best option to satisfy that craving.",TZelLnaGbHgaG7LBI6rfgg,5,3,4,uube89vM0geUGBafTrwhBQ

My Opinion/Story:
""If you go to Las Vegas, you HAVE to go to Noodle Asia.  They have the best porridge"", says my mother.  Coming from my mother who doesn't like rice porridge, I'll have to take her word for it.  So I made a plan to take a trip down to LV.  So last December, my husband and I drove all the way down to LV in my beat-up car.  We stayed for 3 nights and aside from several Vacation Ownerships we attended to get free shows and dinner, we also made a point to visit some of the newer casinos and attempt my luck at the casinos.  Noodle Asia came highly recommended and a MUST try per my mother's standard.  

I had to search for the place since she really didn't remember the name except its the Chinese restaurant in The Venetian.  Being that this is the only one we saw that seems to serve porridge we tried it.  The place looked as messy and beat  up as my car but the hordes of people lining up and eating in this tiny place seems like a good sign.  We got a table after a few minutes.  We couldn't decide what to get so my husband ordered their fried rice and I got their porridge with beef and century egg.  The porridge was really good.  It seems bland at the beginning, probably because I was expecting it to totally blow me away but it grew on me until I couldn't resist not finishing the entire bowl.  

It was made simple but it reminded me of the time my Dad used to take me to Chinatown for a bowl of porridge.  It was delicious.  The service is like any other Chinese restaurant... always in a rush and hard to get them to notice you.  But after a few tries, we were able to get someone to put more water in our glass and finally get us our check.  I'll definitely go back just for the porridge alone but its not a place I'd keep craving for.",_ImEUIt_jn7iJALBlSYCsg,0,0,4,GOfe5nLXMOisR60tnL47dA

the schezwan style beef noodle soup is DELICIOUS, especially if you like spicy soups. The soup is slightly spicy, there is an abundance of both meat and tendon, and the noodles are cooked extremely well (cooked through, but still a little chewy)

I was thoroughly impressed, and finished the dish soup and all

- misc. (the rest)
the price is a little expensive, but it is on the middle of the strip in the Venetian casino - great location and easy to get to

Second visit:
- service
still good, but they messed up our order

- food
tried to order the schezwan style beef noodle soup, but they brought us the curry beef noodle soup instead... my friend didn't realize but I didn't mind because I had just eaten the beef noodle soup the night before (even though it was so good)

eh.. probably should've sent it back. It was okay, but curry beef noodle soup is not my favorite

- misc.
price is similar, and the location is the same

- the food was pretty good (the curry beef noodle was okay, the schezwan style beef noodle soup was FANTASTIC)
- service (attentive, efficient, fast)

What I ended up experiencing was a) poor service (even though the restaurant was half full) b) bland food c) high prices 

Our server forgot our waters for about 15 minutes, brought all our meals out at separate times, and took 20 minutes to pick up our check after she brought it to the tabe. Talk about mind being elsewhere. Actually, let me reprase: Our server never came back to get our check, we had to flag the manager down after 20 minutes of waiting. 

In terms of food... bleh. I had the broccoli and beef with spring rolls on the side. I can safely say I've had $5.99 Chinese takeout meals that have been way better. The food really had no flavor to it, and I had to douse it with duck sauce and other spices to coax any sort of taste out of the dish. 

 Maybe it's my strictly American palette, but I think I've become accustomed to Americanized Asian food and get really thrown off when authentic Asian food is put in front of me. Who knows? 

What I do know is that I wouldn't be back, and would recommend all Vegas-goers to skip over Noodle Asia in favor of the food court nearby.",5lFh-VIN1niLO08cA7RIVQ,0,0,2,7v6Sfblu2PXsLGBl6OWczw

Noodle Asia reminds me of the 24 hour cafes located in California.  After a night out for drinks you need some grease!  Noodle Asia has all the classic Asian dishes from Shanghai, Black Peppered, Fried Rice, and Dim Sum too!  Needless to say, this place doesn't play around when it comes to Chinese food.

But given that you're in Vegas.... what isn't overpriced? The food is actually decent and is probably one of the most authentic Chinese food you can find directly on the strip.

I've only ever ordered one thing: the beef noodle soup. Spicy, flavorful filled with beef & tendon, thin noodles and topped with some green onion and Taiwanese sour cabbage. For $14, it's a major rip off but it definitely hits the spot and it's so good that I can actually finish the whole bowl myself. I tried sharing once and.... let's just say ... THAT was a mistake. I have pretty high standards for beef noodle soup and I definitely like this one.

Speaking of mistakes, don't make this one. As an Asian person, I'm used to ordering a round of water or hot tea for everyone at the table. One time upon ordering tea, the waiter asked me ""how many cups for the tea? "" and I told him ""8, for everyone at the table."" - also thinking.... don't you just bring a big pot of tea? ANYWAYS well, I was not informed that tea cost like $2-$3 PER CUP PER PERSON. So after he brought 8 cups and only 4 of us actually drank the tea.... but we still got charged for 8 cups of tea! So ridiculous!! Lesson learned.

They've also remodeled since I came last and it looks GREAT! Definitely looks more Vegas and gives a more modern/clean look. Service is ok, could be better.

We came across this restaurant by accident but when my parents' friends saw it, they immediately decided to have dinner there. They said they really wanted a hot bowl of noodle soup. There wasn't a lineup so we got seated really quickly. It took them a while to bring us tea. In fact, my dad had to ask the waiter for it. I wouldn't say the waiter was super friendly and attentive. While he was taking our orders, he was just looking at other tables, which I find was unprofessional.

The menu has a big variety of dishes ranging from congee to noodle soup, from fried rice to dim sum, etc. It took me a little while to decide what I wanted because there were a lot of dishes that I like. I finally decided to try their Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup (???). My sister ordered their Fish Filet congee (???) because she wasn't feeling well and congee is easier to digest. My mom ordered their Snow Cabbage with Enoki Mushroom and Fried Tofu Noodle Soup (?????????). My dad and my parents' friends all opted for their Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (???????). I wanted to order the beef noodle soup but I was scared it would be too spicy so I didn't get it.
My Cantonese Beef Stew Noodle soup (???) came with wonton noodles (also called wanton mee). Some people, like my mom, dislike the flavor of this kind of noodle but I'm fine with it. I liked how the texture of this noodle is firmer and thus, chewier. The dish came with only 2 baby bok choy... I definitely would enjoy more vegetables here. The beef stew was flavorful but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I didn't like the fact that half of my portion of meat was just fat. I was expecting more tendons and meat for the price I paid (pay $15 USD). They also cut the meat in small pieces, which made it seem like there were a lot of mean in this bowl. 

My sister's Fish Filet congee (???) congee was pretty good but definitely not worth the price considering the amount of fish filet she had. It was just a decent bowl of congee but nothing too special about it.

My mom's Snow Cabbage with Enoki Mushroom and Fried Tofu Noodle Soup (?????????) was.... I don't even know how to describe it. It definitely didn't look like what she had imagine! It looked really messy with enoki and cabbage all spread out and floating around... It originally came with wonton noodles but since my mom doesn't like this kind of noodle, she exchanged it for Lai Fun (??). This bowl of noodle soup didn't taste bad but definitely not worth its price considering there wasn't a piece of meat and all the ingredients are not expensive at all...
 It seems like their Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (???????) is a must there but you will be quite disappointed, especially if you've had the beef noodle soup from Asia or Taiwan before! It is just not comparable!! It was tasteful but still lacking flavor as compared to any of the beef noodle soup restaurants in Taiwan. I highly suggest anyone to visit Taiwan because this country is a food heaven!

In short, there aren't many Asian restaurants on Las Vegas Strip, if you are tired of Panda Express and would like something classier (conveniently located inside The Venetian Hotel, on the same level as their casino and beautifully decorated) and more expensive, Noodle Asia is the place to go!

The decoration of the place and the uniforms of the servers and chefs are distinctly Chinese and add a nice cultural touch to customers' dining experience. The walls of the restaurant are made of glass, so customers can sit down inside and eat while observing sports games on the big screen outside. There are seats positioned facing outward from the restaurant for precisely that purpose. I imagine that is a huge plus for sports enthusiasts.

Even better when you make a sauce mix from the soy sauce and hot pepper sauce on the table and dip the edamame in it. The red pork wontons were very flavorful too. Very good.

The food came out so quickly and was piping hot. I thoroughly enjoyed my Cantonese beef noodle soup. The noodles were cooked just right, fresh baby bok choy, tender beef and tendon, and hearty broth.

But after 30 minutes of waiting in line and watching the servers completely fumbling over each other - they were clearly inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing, I knew we were doomed.  But we had already waited that long so we stayed.  From the line, I watched table after table trying to flag someone down because they wanted to pay.  No one would come to them.  I look over to see where the servers are and all four servers, standing together near the cash register looking completely flustered.  Meanwhile, there is a gigantic line outside, which is continuing to grow, and tables are empty and cleared and no one is coming to address the customers waiting in line.  Finally, after about 40 minutes, the man in front of me started to get annoyed obviously by seeing pretty much half the restaurant clear out and no one being seated so he walks in to the four servers standing around the cash register and says something to them.  Finally, one server comes and takes that man and his friend and seats them at the counter.  Then she goes back to standing there - like deer in headlights.  Good grief. Then it was my turn to flag the girl down and tell her that I am happy to sit at the counter as there are empty chairs.  When I tell her that, then she seats us, finally.   I have no idea how long the others continued to wait outside.

We ordered:
- Chicken/Mushroom Noodle Soup
- Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce
- Shrimp Dumplings
- Hot and Sour Soup
- Cold Jelly Fish Side dish


The Chicken/Mushroom soup came in a nice portion sized bowl and it was not cheap. My dad said the flavor was good , but my mom preferred my hot and sour soup better. There were lots of chicken and mushroom bits in the soup and it was hot (temperature). 

The Chinese broccoli was excellent, the sauce wasn't generously drizzled on the broccoli which we preferred. The dish was a hit and i would've ordered that again if i came the next time.

The Shrimp dumpling (dim sum) was good, but not worth the price. It came lukewarm or not even warm. The dumplings were sticking with each other. but, nonetheless it was food. 

Hot and sour soup was a hit for my mom and I. I liked it , there were lots of flavor and it gave a kick (spicyness).  I would order this again, but for 5 bucks for a cup is SUPER EXPENSIVE. the cup was not a big cup..so get a bowl if you're hungry. 

the jelly fish was a slight dissapoint out of all the dishes we tried. It lacked flavor and it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it.

Authentic chinese/asian food with an extensive menu, including pan fried noodle. soup noodle, typical rice dishes and even porridge. Price is very reasonable considering the quality, portions and location (Vegas). 
Food is well done with fresh veggies and marinated meat, not salty or greasy (which is the problem with most chinese joints in my opinion). 

Service is quick meaning if there are folks waiting for seats, your check will come rather quickly after you finish eating and before you even walked away from the table, waiter is already cleaning the table for the next customers.

what i ate:
- combo fried rice: unremarkable. as expected. a bit on the oilier side. enough for two people. 
- egg flower soup (cup): exactly as expected. unremarkable

pros:
- asian food, something for everyone. while leaned more towards chinese cuisine, there was pho, dim sum, etc. 
- open 24/7
- located on campus at the hotel i was staying at
- fast efficient service. traditional asian style as in, flag down your server if you need something. 
- fresh coconut water/juice. when you're hungover, this is a godsend. 

mediocre:
- the food was so so. i mean it wasnt bad, but it wasnt great either. 

cons: 
- price was a bit steep for the food, but you're paying for the convenience of not having to drive to chinatown. 

would i come again? sure why not?",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,1,1,3,zRU5Lb1_ln_cHYovZptYgg

Living in SF all my life and being such a close proximity to a variety of Asian restaurants made me forgot that people in other areas aren't that fortunate. I've come to the conclusion that there is no good AUTHENTIC Asian food on the strip...even if the people cooking it ARE Asian! Ya, GO FIGURE! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE all types of cuisines, but after countless nights of drinking, the best hangover cure is jook, noodle soup, or any type of carbs for that matter! 

After the most wildest drunken night at XS, all we wanted was ASIAN comfort food without having to trek outta of the strip. We came across Noodle Asia in the Venetian/Palazzo Directory; it had ""Noodles"" in it's title, so it was a go!

Normally, you get free tea with your meal at Asian restaurants, but Noodles Asia charges $3.50. It's Vegas afterall, so I digress.

We started with the Jellyfish Salad ($10.95). What we got was a a glob of red-colored jelly fish on a 4-inch diameter plate. The jellyfish had a weird texture...actually it had no texture at all. It tasted like it had been marinating in a bag of chili oil. You know, one of those jellyfish packets you get at an Asian Market for 99 cents?

I ordered the ""Beef Noodles"" which was technically Beef Chow Fun ($12.95).  Ok, why not just call it that? It was very meh, the noodles  looked mushed together b/c they were over-cooked. And, I thought chow fun was suppose to be flat-WIDE noodles? Ummm, at least they were generous with the beef....

Service: Ahhhh, even though you're paying 2-3x more for the food here, the service NO different than any other hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. As in, you just get your food fast and then get ignored. 

Other than convenience and the fact I was CRAVING Asian food badly, I can't imagine making a point to come back here. But hey, when you're hungry AND hungover, just about anything would do...",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,2,1,3,Y34l31kBSs8jDaqW-8EjIA
4053315,2014-04-10,0,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"Having been to Vegas 7-8 times, I always seem to forget Noodle Asia - not in a bad way, because I've been there 3 times now.  But I never thought about writing a review because it's one of those places that you'd go for three reasons: 1) convenience, as it's located in Venetian, 2) hung over and need Chinese food, or 3) you want something other than fake PJ Chang Chinese food.

Tips: don't order dumplings, wonton soup, shu mai and other classic dishes that restaurants can make in big batches.  Go for dishes they actually have to stir-fry and cook.

Knowing to skip large-batch menu items, we went with the mushroom chicken noodle soup and curry beef stew.  For both dishes, they'd be considered above average in Chinatown, and definitely fantastic in Vegas strip.  Case in point, when I had their wonton soup and shu mai, they felt store-bought and under-seasoned.  

There was one black mark during our visit - we ordered a Thai ice tea and they didn't have anymore.  But a few minutes later another waiter said they had one last cup - we happily accepted.  They added so much water to the Thai ice tea that it was a joke.  I found that to be shady.

Nevertheless stick with dishes that they HAVE to cook (and I don't mean fried rice), and you'll come away with a positive experience.",tGvJAy7uzAHJsPneHxd_rQ,2,2,4,HjME4jPeKtyfds_wO8e4XA

The soup was OK.  The broth was a little weak, and the noodles were not that great.  However, after two days of eating American and French food, I needed my Azn fix.  The won ton were OK, but $4 extra for 4 won tons is a little steep.  The ambiance is sterile and the service was OK.

Noodle Asia Service: When the capacity is about 75% full or less, the service has been consistently good.  Servers will follow up with your drinks and the kitchen will get you your food in a decent time.  Above 75% and you might run into issues as it doesn't appear that they are staffed appropriately.  Also, when a line forms outside the entrance you might want to go somewhere else if you don't want to sit at the counter

Noodle Asia Cuisine:  I've only ordered the noodle soups as I always seem to be on a time constraint when I dine here.  With that, the Szechwan beef is my current favorite.  It's Szechwan spicy were it doesn't burn them mouth but I'll start sweating as I dine. The classic Hong Kong Won Ton soup works if you're not into spicy.  The broth has good and better days but the volume of noodles and beef has always been plentiful

You can find noodle houses up Spring Mountain that offer better quality cuisine for cheaper.  However, if you're confined to the strip Noodle Asia is your best/only option which isn't a bad thing.

4095620,2012-08-07,1,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"Before you judge me of giving a 5-star review to a Chinese restaurant in Vegas, I need to explain myself. Yes, I am surprised even at myself for giving a 5-star rating to a casual Chinese restaurant.  No, sweet & sour pork and lemon chicken are not in my repertoire of Chinese food.  No, I was not drunk when I visited the restaurant; and I think reviews by those who admitted being drunk and their judgement impaired should be tossed out.   I am picky so I do not like just anything.  I grew up in Hong Kong, have travelled to major Chinese cities, and have lived in both Vancouver and San Francisco for many years so I know my Chinese foods.

I do have to emphasize though that my rating is based on one dish that I had.

My parents and I were spending a few days in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  After coming out from ""O"", my parents retired to their room for the evening.  I was getting hungry even though we had a big lunch so I wandered around to check out the restaurants opening late in Palazzo / Venetian where we stayed.  I had been to Noodles in Bellagio and Zine in Palazzo.  Both were decent so I thought I would give Noodle Asia a try.

The menu is quite extensive.  The prices are very reasonable considering that it is a hotel restaurant.  I ordered a plate of fried rice with Chinese sausages, egg white and Chinese broccoli.  It didn't take long until a generous serving arrived.   It looked just as simple as the menu suggested with 3 ingredients and rice.  I took a bite and I said to myself, ""OMG.  This is the best fried rice I've ever had.""  And it was, seriously, the best fried rice I've ever had anywhere!  The Chinese sausage slices were sweet and tender.  The egg whites were fluffy.  However, the rice was the star of the dish.  It was not browned with dark soy sauce and it has all the flavours from being fried in a hot and well-seasoned wok.  

The plate was just under $14.  Although the restaurant is a essentially a cafe but it was far better than any $15 - $18 fried rice dishes served in many other well appointed restaurants.

A few weeks later and I still remember the dish.  My partner is going to Vegas for a conference in a couple of weeks and I told him he needed to go there and order the rice if he could only eat out once.",IP3DqE3W5Co2Ksam39Rasg,2,1,5,KeNwV-76Xjtw7c-fShpfwg

The food here is the best Chinese in town.  It's authentic Chinese, not the fake, greasy, and nasty Panda Express.  It has real authentic flavors and all the chefs in the kitchen are actually Chinese, so you know the food is good and for real here.

Even the hot sauce in the white container on the table is good, and I see many Venetian guests order takeout and probably bring it back to their rooms to eat.  That's how good the food is here.

Service is alright so there's really nothing to complain about here.  For Vegas, this place is definitely 5 stars.

It should be called Noodle China. 95% of the dishes are some variety of Chinese food, be it Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Cantonese. 

Sure, they throw in a couple of Japanese things, like Edamame appetizer, and something that is wok fried udon? (More typically, this would be yakisoba, or fried soba noodles). And they do have at least 1 Korean dish, Kimchee! I didn't see any Viet noodles, Thai noodles, Korean noodles, Singaporean noodles, or more Japanese noodles, etc. 

The atmosphere is casual, with an open view of the large woks in the kitchen, with the water flowing over the cooking area to remove all the grease and tidbits spilled in the stir-fry cooking process, just like a Chinatown kitchen. 

The food isn't bad actually. The green veggie of the day was a choice of Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli) or Baby Bok Choy. I went for the Bok Choy. NIce small baby stems. 

I also ordered a bowl of Nau Nam Mein Curry Soup, or Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle Soup, It hit the spot and warmed me up, as I was chilled by the overactive air-conditioning in the Venetian. I don't know how those cocktail waitresses in the skimpy, short , sleeveless, bar wench dresses can stand the chill. Their dual weather barometers definitely would perk up in the nippyness.  Mine did!

I also ordered an oolong tea, which came in a cast iron Japanese style tea pot. 

The service is just a little friendlier than a Chinatown diner. But they are strict about waiting to be seated! IF you seat yourself, they may call you out on it! There is a bar you can eat at and watch the cooks, or plenty of tables where you can watch the gamblers and those freezing waitresses. 

So Oolong tea, baby bok choy, and Brisket of Beef Curry Noodle soup. Sounds like about $10 in your typical Chinatown, right?

This is Vegas baby, try and guess again. Go higher, way higher! 

How about $30!?
For one person?!? WTF! 

If you are a cheap Chinese person raised in Chinatown or FOB, or if you are less than fourth generation ABC, don't go here! You will feel ripped off!  This is not Hon's Won Ton on Kearney in SF for sure! 

Tea: $3.50
Stir Fried Bok Choy: $12.00
Curry Beef Noodle Soup: $12.95

Because if you're dining inside the Venetian, you should expect to pay double of what you normally pay at an independent restaurant.

There is a direct view of the kitchen no matter where you sit. We were worried that our food would take a while to come out since there were so many tables in front of us that haven't gotten their food. However, our entrees came out super fast! The food was piping hot and you can tell it just came off the grill.

But the quality? Definitely not authentic-tasting and lacked flavor. You can always add soy sauce to make it more satisfying. I think the food came off the grill a little TOO soon, almost like the chefs rush through all of their orders and don't have time to season the dishes more carefully.

Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're really hungry and don't mind fishing out extra money to eat sub-par Chinese food.",nLscfYYVotblnQNv0epxqw,0,0,3,PoVZIbJm9MD_N13ztpdeVw

My boyfriend ordered the Sichuan style beef noodle soup and I ordered a mapo tofu which came with a bowl of Jasmine rice. The noodles came fast since I guess more people order noodle dishes than rice dishes. I had to wait extra 15 minutes or so for mine to come. The noodle soup was actually pretty good; it did tasted like braised meat-based soup I've had in China but maybe the flavor was a bit too intense and salty than what I've had in the past. Still pretty good though; the beef pieces in the soup were too cube-y and thus not very tender. The noodles were good quality but not sure if it was hand-pulled there or they just bought good quality ones that were frozen. The mapo tofu was kind of sweet and Americanized - probably closer to the kind I would get in Japan or Korea rather than in Sichuan. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. Tofu was also very firm and not silky. Unless you're dying to eat not so authentic but not exactly P.F.

1. Super fast service 
2. Large menu of mediocre dishes

Other dishes we got: 
Sesame noodles (Dan Dan noodles ???) were absurdly mushy. For some reason, it came with the noodles already chopped up... As if they were expecting a toddler to be eating it.

Wonton noodles soup - pretty standard. I'd be really impressed if they messed this up.

YES my mouth was like the Sahara desert. Everything was pretty do it ourselves including getting our bill. Had to flag down 2 different people just to get our ONE bill. 
This is the part that gets me. When the lady came by with our check she handed it to us then proceeded to STARE US DOWN AND BREATH ON US until we put a card in and returned it to her. UM.. can we please get a minute to ourselves since we had to give you 10 minutes to even get this to us? Life isn't always fair I guess. Then the lady returned WITHOUT the credit card we had put in it but with somebody else's signed receipt. The only thing that could make the service worse at this point was if she started eating off of our plates.

Highlights are the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup, Pineapple Fried Rice, and old man Kenny, who is one of those nice old school managers. 

Location/ambiance - Okay, this is definitely weird since it's an ""open air"" restaurant in the middle of a casino.  I think it's great for business since you get the random foot traffic as well as the people who stay in the hotel.",Vq96u5zcVVQUg9oLxLjKnQ,1,1,3,HqwhJWdBINJEDgHGrshhpw

Noodle Asia has always hit the spot when I'm in Las Vegas and craving Chinese food.  I only wish they would open a tad bit later to let me wander in drunk fulfilling the craving for a hot bowl of won ton noodle soup.  For those thinking the high review is because of eating under influence that is not true.  I've been here drunk, sober, and hung over and all three circumstances Asia Noodle has always been good to me.  I even try to stay inside the Venetian or Palazzo just so I don't have to go outside and face the elements to get to my beloved Asia Noodle.

Won Ton Noodle Soup (with and without BBQ pork), Night Market Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, and the BBQ Combination Plate are my standard fare here.

On a side note, Asia Noodle recently got a facelift and looks a lot fancier than it did before.  For you sports fan nuts out there, they even have bar seating that faces the Cantor's sports book so you don't have to unglue your eyes from the game while eating.",aT8XPrYOWORUwMR9jlBnpQ,0,0,4,h9n41gCWIQngPaqnv6B01Q

We then ordered our food.  Another 15 minutes go by.  Two separate groups of Chinese guests are seated in the interim (including one group of 12+). They order and receive their all of their food before anything of ours comes out.  They are literally being served at light speed.  We are still sitting at an empty table.  That's very bad.

So we finally get our food after about 35 minutes of waiting and watching everyone around us, including those who came afterwards, get their food first.  I can't speak for what anyone else ordered, but the orange chicken ($19) was atrocious.  Watery, lukewarm, and not flavorful at all.  The ""jasmine rice"" was badly overcooked white rice.

If it is available on the menu, then I tend to be a creature of habit by ordering Kung Pao Chicken at practically every Asian restaurant I visit. This restaurant was no different. In a way, it's my barometer for judging Asian cuisine. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with their Kung Pao Chicken at all. The chicken was tough and dry while the sauce was clumpy and somewhat syrupy.  The texture to this sauce reminded me of melted caramel and not the typical thin Kung Pao sauce. The taste was mostly sweet and tangy rather than spicy. A strange taste for a Kung Pao dish.  It just was not enjoyable.  On the other hand, the shrimp stir fried noodles, potstickers, and won ton soup were great. My wife and I were really pleased with all these noodle dishes and how they were cooked, steamed and fried to perfection. All the vegetables, seafood and meat in these dishes were fresh and delicious. The cabernet sauvignon was a perfect complement to wash down all these dishes.

Had the porridge dish as well as the fried chicken wings & also the szechwan beef noodle soup and singapore fried noodle.   Sounds like alot of food for the 3 of us, but it was actually pretty good to cure the buzz and the quality wasn't bad for casino chinese food.

Only gripe was, the porridge was lukewarm and they promptly took it back and heated it up nicely for us.

I ordered the Schezuan Beef Noodles, and damn that sh*t was a bowl full of deliciousness.  If you're in the mood  for noodles but not wanting pho, I highly recommend coming here and ordering this dish.  

Noodles were definitely fresh, the broth had a nice kick to it, and the chucks of beef with tendons still attached made my day.  Perfect for a hangover.

It's like his go to dish so I made sure to eat here during my trip. I arrived a little after 7pm and the place wasn't very busy. The service was initially attentive and the workers spoke Chinese very politely to me. They gave me the option to get the dimsum the same time as my noodle dishes or as an appetizer. I chose it as an appetizer. This was a nice option to have but I wish I got all the food the same time because it got busy and it took awhile to get my noodle dishes. Service also wasn't that great toward the end of my meal so this place is more a 3.5 spot. 

It's not often I come to Vegas anymore so I ordered up a feast. I got their Har Gow, Hong Kong Won Ton (Mein), Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup and some hot tea. Hot tea is not free!! I'm Chinese so paying for hot tea at a Chinese restaurant is foreign to me. 

Food:

The Har Gow was very good and went great with their chili oil (you need to ask for this item, it's not on the table as a condiment). Har Gow was large and was easy to pick up without it falling apart. The shrimp was fresh and sweet. 

Hong Kong Won Ton was just as my cousin described. It's really good and the won tons actually had meat inside vs just fat and filler. Soup was like Hong Kong broth and there was just the right amount of noodles. (Add the chili oil if you like spice, it was sooooo good!)

The Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup was good but my least favorite. It was the dish that I left unfinished. The broth had good flavor and had a slight kick to it. Noodles and beef were ok but nice option for noodles here. Portions were generous but broth could have been hotter (temperature wise).",I_4cXopXxFr5B7adXZ1ruQ,24,29,4,B66qO4-C5l_HxxYhWIRENg

It can be pretty pricey, esp for noodles, because you can typically get Pho for less than $10 at any normal restaurant...whether or not it is ""Prime"" pho.

The wonton soup and fried rice were pretty good also, and so was this spicy noodle dish, which I forget at the moment exactly what it was called.

The Cantonese items are all fantastic including ""gon chow ngau hor"" the beef chow fun, or the soups like the ginger chicken double boiled soup, also fabulous.

But move towards the more northern Chinese selections and things start going south. For instance, the noodles soup with preserved mustard greens and pork -- below average! The noodles were so doughy it made the broth muddy and not clear.

I know from previous experience there can be quite a line for this place, but they usually get through it decently quick.

Our server immediately arrived to take our drink order.  They have the usual suspects for Asian beers as well as a small wine and cocktail list.  I went with Asahi and the server was fairly quick with the refills.  To start we went with the seared shrimp chive dumplings and Har Gow, which are steamed shrimp dumplings.

The appetizers came out fairly quickly, definitely under 10 minutes.  The Har Gow was good but the winner in my estimation was the shrimp chive dumplings.  They have a nice crispy exterior and really strong chive flavor.  If you do not like chives do not order this dish, as it is definitely chive-forward.  I love chives and not surprisingly I loved this dish.

For my entree I had the Pho Special Prime which includes rare ribeye, brisket, tripe, and meatballs.  The broth was good but it lacked the depth of flavor I have had at many pho places.  The brisket and ribeye were good, the trip was not as good but certainly not bad, but the meatballs were a miss for me.  The texture was very hard as if they had been overworked.  I would get the pho again but I would request extra brisket instead of meatballs.  I did have to pull a couple of pieces of meat out of the soup in order to cut them on a plate.  They were too large to eat in one bite.

I would order the dumplings again for sure and would try the pho, provided I can get the meatballs substituted.  This is a more than solid joint if you are at the poker room or sportsbook and need a quick bite.  I will likely return.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,2,3,RUvDUjP2hHqVSk8vGnxQKA

Fried rice:  extremely oily and packed with MSG.
Dim sum: nothing special except the price.  3x what you would pay in your local Chinatown.
Noodle soups: correctly made, loaded with MSG, very little toppings, expensive.

i ordered the si jiu beef wok tossed noodle stuff and it was bland...i had to add spoonfuls of soy sauce, and i wasn't the only one that thought so..everyone at my table that tried it said it was bland too. to me, it was just like the chow mein from panda express, but with beef. sad. and it cost about $14 for that. 

my bf ordered the cantonese beef stew i believe, and that was kind of flavorless too...tasted like ramen i could make from a bag....

two of my friends ordered the bbq duck stuff though and they said it was heavenly. i didn't try it because i don't like duck :( 

maybe we just ordered the wrong things. as for the prices, people are saying you're in vegas so expect to pay that much...and that is true...but i say, if you're in vegas, don't look for asian food and expect it to be good...and no matter where you go, you're going to pay a not so cheap price, but if you're going to do that, at least do it at a place that is not something you can find cheaper and better tasting in chinatown. explore different places that aren't offered around where you are from --- those are the places worth shelling the money out for :D",zlqbbhAujrMla0eDiK7mIw,0,0,2,25hhSTie6hX8JjArJySAWw

I sent a text out, and the food was there.  Also ordered a Vietnamese Iced coffee.

The food was not impressive.  The roast duck pieces had nothing but skin on them.  Absolutely no meat.  Maybe they saw that I was an Asian guy and they felt that I had enough roast duck in my lifetime and know how it taste like so they are saving it for those that might not have tried it before.  COMPLETELY understand (not really)!  The bbq pork was BRIGHT pinkish/red which almost blinded me.  I think they glazed it intensely, which actually was not too bad.  The rice was eh...rice.  The coffee was not as strong as I'm accustomed to, but was pretty good.

All and all, not worth the 23 dollars total.  Maybe if you look like you've got money, they'll give you the duck with the meat on it though.  Good luck.",fi6diD7ld-obJic8-k2ziA,0,1,2,QAvdO0LAyE1ItUGBFN4inw

telling me about a certain dish which I shared a nommy sentiment.
The restaurant is Chinese-themed, and it is called Noodle Asia,
a few steps away from the casino floor is where you will find it.

The wait in line was somewhat time-consuming,
so be sure to account for the wait when you are starving.
This restaurant can accommodate parties large and small,
if you are forever alone have a seat at the bar by the kitchen wall.

Their menu has many appetizing offerings,
drinks, foods, and other delicious things.
On the both occasions that I visited with my group,
I got a pot of hot tea, and a bowl of the Sichuan beef noodle soup.

The service here was efficient, accurate, and brisk,
our food order came out in about 10 minutes - nothing was amiss.
The tea was what you'd expect from any ol' Asian joint,
but oh my stars I must emphasize that the noodle soup was ON POINT.

The beef noodle soup had me speechless,
the taste of the broth had the right mix of savory spices,
the meat was exceedingly fatty, with a buttery texture,
and the noodles brought the balance to bring the entire dish together.

All-in-all I'd say Noodle Asia is a must-try spot,
primarily for the Sichuan beef noodle soup fresh from the pot.
Make sure you give this place a whirl,

Right next to the Venetian sports book with big glass windows that allow you to watch games while eating some great food.

First off, the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup here is fantastic.  Great and relatively fantastic.  If you are craving authentic Chinese Beef Noodle Soup, it won't get better than this in Vegas.  

The Singaporean pan fried noodles were also great.  Well spiced and flavored, and like the noodles in the Beef Noodle Soup, well cooked and perfectly al dente.  

Highly recommended place, especially for you Cantonese and Taiwanese tastes.  The style of cooking here will accommodate both types of tongue.

It was between Noodle Asia or Beijing Noodles No 9.

We decided to go to Noodle Asia Because of the review and more rates.

This restaurant is located in Venetian.

They are very busy during brunch-Lunch time.

Good service but to busy to call a server.

Pro: Fast preparing the food. Closes at 3AM!
Con: to busy to ask for a fork.
Advice: Order everything at once, because you won't see your server until your done with your food.

Food
Pro: Their Shrimp Dim Sum was amazing. Also recommend Pork & Duck with rice.
Con: I cant say this is bad but by demand we ordered their Beef Noodles soup. I really didn't think it was amazing nor tasty. It was actually very salty. It might have been just that day but I didn't think it was great compare to what other Yelpers inputted. also we tired their Milk Bubble tea..... ill say 5/10. We got it as soon as we ordered it, had barely ice in it and wasn't cold.

NA's gets the flavor precisely right with just the perfect mixture of soy sauce and chili pepper. Furthermore, the beef is in chunks as it should be and incredibly tender, so you know it's been stewing forever. The noodles were my favorite kind, thick and flat. The only thing missing were the vegetables. Not the pickled garnish but the bok choy (or sometimes spinach). No vegetables included. That makes my healthy voice sad.

The shu mai were quite good, considering we were eating at 1am. And my boyfriend's Dan Dan noodles were spicy, brothy, peanut-y delicious. They did not hold back on the accompaniments. The potstickers were cold and gross. Don't order those.

5515000,2010-07-29,5,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"I have to admit...I was fairly impressed that you could actually find decent Asian food at a hotel eatery.  I used to think that these joints were only offered by hotels as a way to satisfy their Asian clientele from overseas.  I mean, all those old Asian guys gotta find something to remind them of home while they take a break from Pai Gow right?

Prices are a bit steep relative to normal Asian places, but obviously there's going to be a premium for being where you're at.  They're probably betting that you're not going to go out somewhere off the strip in search of cheaper Chinese food in that desert heat.  And being a casino, they're taking the smart bet.  At least they don't cheat you on your order; portions are still pretty respectable.

For an appetizer, we grabbed the Spicy Tofu dish off the little menu card in those plastic holders on the table. I was expecting to get cubes, but it turned out to be thin slices off a tofu block that had been stir fried and then triangled. There were approximately 10 slices or so, and the whole thing was spiced up wtih chili oil sauce.  Taste was pretty good and there was certainly a bit of kick, but there had to be just based on the amount of that oil on the plate.  Seriously, I imagine a little part of health freaks would die if they saw this dish (i wonder if I should even bother calling it a ""sauce"").  

The Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Lo Mein?...not sure of the spelling) was touted by one of my friends as possibly the best he's ever had outside of Taiwan (and apparently, one of the the spiciest based on the beads of sweat rolling down his head).  Three of the four of us ended up getting it based on how much he kept talking about the dish (my other friend ordered the Cantonese Beef Stew instead).  The broth was flavorful and it didn't seem too bad with the sodium level.  Certainly no worse than the average bowl of pho.  There were some good size chunks of meat to go with the noodles, so it certainly will help get you full.

Not too bad of a find for a hotel eatery, especially if you want to lay off some of that rich food in the buffet.  Three stars if only because I can't afford to give one more after all these inflated prices.  That said, it's still probably one of the more cost effective meals you can find, so you could do worse in that regard.  And btw, that broth really isn't all that spicy, so I don't think you have to worry about sweating like my friend.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,7,4,3,3Da1_wZgwVj1O8hg4oUyEw

This place is officially a staple of my Vegas trips.  The service straight sucks.  The food is expensive for Chinese.  The wait can get a little long.  The Szcehwan Beef Noodle soup is effing legit.  It doesn't just hit the spot after an alcohol marathon, it finds the spot and smashes it with a sledge hammer.  Spicy broth.  Soft noodles.  Tender meat.  The kimchee is $6.50.  Yes, I know that is expensive kimchee.  And yes, I order it every time (and side note: Noodles at Bellagio has $7 kimchee, I will never order it again).  It's also right next to the sports book so you can catch a glimpse of some of the games, which is a plus in my book.

Warning: if you bring Chinese people with you, you will probably hear about how unauthentic and expensive this place is for the duration of your entire meal.  The kitchen is open, so you can see all the cooks and they're Chinese.  Rub that one in.

True story: I tried to bribe the guy $100 to reopen the restaurant 5 minutes after it closed at 3am.  He thought about it.  For maybe 30 seconds.  Then we were forced to leave empty handed to the terribleness that is Grand Lux Cafe.  Never again.",ML8a11GCGBXfzkSW436Q-g,4,5,5,BRXmgp2J5101iG1JwR-KGg

I'm here for CES and my company has a suite in the Venetian. I'm not feeling too well and the weather doesn't make it any better. I was in deep need of soup.

I started to think of where I could possibly walk to on the strip that had noodle soup and luckily enough -- I saw the Venetian map where someone already pulled up the restaurant options, and low and behold: Noodle Asia! 

I could not have been anymore happier than in that moment.

Upon arriving, right on their stand was their special for the day ""Convention Special"" featuring 8 curry fish balls, won ton noodle soup AND Vietnamese coffee.

I was like ""ok, now I'm more sold and more in love"".

Now about the food: BEST WON TONS I'VE EVER HAD. EVER. Even the noodles were amazing and I'm not usually a fan of yellow noodles. Broth was good too, but as usual I had to add chili paste to it -- only because I love spicy -- it could have been a great soup without it.

I'm a big Vietnamese coffee fan and this I loved too! 

Now I don't have much to say about the curry fish balls only because I'm actually not a fan personally of curry fish balls. Curry alone -- I love. Fish balls alone -- I love. But I just can't get the two to go well in my mout together.

Anyways -- great portions. They have a bar so people eating by themselves can be seated quickly. I'm super stuffed.

Now I must leave because I'm done eating and the line is getting long.",thGUk0xd3trl8cR9qI75rQ,1,0,5,kPFylksH73h5VDzvkz6Ykg
5723071,2013-03-04,0,_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA,"Located inside The Venetian, Noodle Asia is apparently a very convenient place for people to fulfill their soup craving after a whole night of drinking and dancing, especially Asians. 
Like what I just said, we found our way to Noodle Asia after checking-out on Sunday after drinking and dancing til 4am and sleeping for like 2-3 hours. 
We didn't expect to get cheap and good China-Town-noodle-soups, but NOodle Asia definitely didn't disappoint us.

They have many different types of Chinese noodle soups, Dim Sum, Appetizers, and other dishes like rice and fried noodles which I didn't look at. We ordered Ha Cao and Xiu Mai from Dim Sum. The Xiu Mai came out pipping hot. It was VERY good. All of us love it very much. 
We then waited soooooooo long for the Ha Cao to come out. The Ha Cao was Okay in my opinion. The shrimps inside were very fresh and cooked just perfect; however, the skin outside was a lil over-cooked, so it was kinda powdery and a lil bit mashed. The good Ha Cao skin should be a bit chewy. 

We then waited very long again for our noodles to come out. 2 wonton noodle soups for my cousins came out first. And about 5 minutes later, my wonton soup came out. i seriously don't understand why it took them longer to make my wonton soup while mine was exactly like my cousins' wonton noodle soups without the noodles. It didn't make any sense to me. But anyway, the soup was very good. The broth is clear. Wonton seemed to be freshly made. I tried the noodles from my cousin, and they were cooked just right. Very good. 

The other 2 girls ordered spicy beef noodle soups. The beef was very tender. Lots of meat also. They like it. 

Service meets standard. The place looks clean and modern which is no surprise because it is located in the Venetian :)

This is definitely a good place for soups without going anywhere far. I would recommend Noodle Asia to open 24/7 if they haven't done so because apparently after getting out of XS at 4am, all we think about is a bowl of soup (if you're still awake enough to think)",h6XeWG_z5l082qKga1wuMw,0,0,3,Or14Eu8FkI3XSlCW7owHLg

Of their unbelievably limited selection of GF items, I chose the Broccoli and Chicken because I am a moron. It was literally the blandest meal I have ever eaten. Almost entirely devoid of spice, the chicken had a boiled unpleasant texture. The broccoli was lazily steamed. I ate it anyway because it was late and I didn't have time to find another place. Gross. At least it was healthy. 1 star for that. I was too demoralized to send it back. I just sat there and ate it like a loser. Pathetic. Now I hate myself.

It shouldn't be a surprise that the prices here are sky high, but you just have to take one glance around and realize that the restaurant is inside the Venetian hotel on the Strip. You might do a double-take and see that yes, it's around $10-$13 for porridge, or $10 for wonton soup. Basically, whatever prices you're used to, just multiply by 2 for this place.

We ordered a wide assortment of dishes:

Seafood crispy pan fried noodles
Wonton soup
Seafood rice porridge
Vegetable spring rolls
Soy milk

I honestly thought everything was comparable to what I've had at like a Sam Woo cafe or something like that. Just double the price. Just good 'ol Chinese comfort food. Our total bill was $50.

But, since their renovation a couple of years ago, the quality seemed a bit off.  For starters, my old favorite, red wonton, has consistently been bland, chewy, and sometimes even on the cold side where the wontons are actually lumpy.  Other dishes such as spicy Ying-Nan noodles are inconsistent, ranging from missing ground beef, to scallions, to the chilly.

My latest visit, this past weekend, was a HUGE disappointment.  My Young-Chow fried rice was wet, sticky, lacking the distinct wok flavor this particular dish is known for.  The shrimps also seemed ""off"", with a squishy bite.  There were literally six diced char siu (I counted).  No scallions, and hardly any presence of eggs.  Most of all, it was just flat and flavorless.

The menu mostly consists of noodle soups, stir fried noodles and fried rice. Besides that, they have less than 10 main dishes to choose from, and it's pretty much only the standard things my white friends always order - beef/chic broccoli, orange beef/chic, mongolian beef, etc. 

We did a bunch of stuff for 6 family style. Things that were good: nothing. Things that were decent: fried rice, hot braised shrimp (aka sweet sour shrimp), siu mai. Things that were crap - everything else we ordered. Pass on the following: pot stickers, beef curry stew, kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, orange chicken, egg roll/spring rolls.

If you insist on staying here to have asian food, you can probably get comparable quality stuff for less from the panda express type place at the food court - think it's called wasabi jane?

I got the impression that this was a great sign and people in line were ready to get in and order lunch!!  The restaurant is very open area, lots of space, and nice decor.  I liked it very much and felt comfortable seated at my table.  There are lots of tables and I also saw a counter area.

I still looked over the menu while I was waiting and there are soooo many items on there that I would love to try, but I specifically came back for the ""Pho Prime"".  OK, this is the most Expensive Pho I have ever bought at $16.95.  I normally pay 7-8$ for a bowl at other places in Nor Cal.  But that being said, I really didn't care about the price, if I want something, I buy it and plus I was on vacation in Vegas... have to Enjoy every moment to the fullest :)

The Pho Prime was Delicious.  It had a great flavor in the broth, lots of meats, lots of noodles, and I enjoyed eating it  BUT, No Hoisin sauce, it didn't come with my plate so I asked for it and my server said they ran out yesterday??  The Pho Prime is a huge bowl too, I could not finish it.  It was definitely worth the price and place!  My server was OK, and she was busy with other tables as well.  I was disappointed I couldn't order a dessert, 3 of 4 choices that I wanted to try on the menu were out!!!  At first I almost didn't believe it lol, like for real?

Tried to order a few things family style...

Hot & Sour Soup - Neither hot (spicy) nor sour.
Seafood Soft Noodle - this didn't taste like anything, except maybe for oil.
Cantonese Sausage Fried Rice - best entree, but more sausage/egg/veggies would have been nice.
Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce - Not bad.
Siu Mai - Nope!  All out.
Har Gow - Nope!  All out of this too.

Ugh.  Nothing was terrible, but nothing was that good either.

They do give a huge serving as well with alot of soup. They do not however give alot of bean sprouts and veggies on the side. I also ordered the fried wings and they were really great!

I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with their food.

Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup- Very good! I like it just as much as the places in Rowland or SGV! Chewy noodles with a dark beefy soy/vinegary broth and lots of tender beef chunks. The only thing is i wish it had some MORE greens in it than the skimpy green onions. Perhaps some cilantro/onion and the chopped pickled mustard greens or bokchoy like the other places. Overall delicious but the soup gets hella salty towards the end be warned.

Spicy Ying Nan Noodle Soup- NOT spicy at all. Tastes pretty bland. Its not seafood broth or chicken or beef broth. Can't really distinguish what the base taste is. Even with 2 generous scoops of Chili sauce it wasn't really spicy. I would skip this next time, however other people liked it.

Hot and Sour Soup- Loved it! I was wary since some reviews say it is not good but we liked it alot! Good balance of sour in my opinion and lots of toppings

Pho Special- $18 for a bowl of Pho better be good and it was according to my fellow Vietnamese diners! So if you can't make it to Pho Kim Long, here is a back up! (Another Pho back-up would be ordering the ""Zen Noodles"" at Grand Lux Cafe) 

Overall, i wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if you staying in the Venetian and can't make it out to Chinatown but crave some asian food, Noodle Asia will do!",XqmISkEvoUQ0ECK-qFQ1Kw,0,0,3,ilbImZjW1knru9xXe_nSsA

Won Ton Soup - GOOD

Miso Soup - Ok.  I thought the miso soup would be a small bowl but I was mistaken (I ordered miso soup AND Beef Congee).  It was a gigantic bowl.  It's pretty much an entree in itself.

Red Won Tons - DELICIOUS

Siu Mai (6) - It's ok.  I've had better (esp at Elite.  See review for Elite).

Beef Congee - The Congee is probably the BEST congee I've ever had in my entire life.  I've had congee from pretty much every Chinese restaurant and even ventured into New York's Chinatown to the highly acclaimed Congee Village).  The porridge is cooked perfectly and not watery or too thick.  It was PERFECT.
