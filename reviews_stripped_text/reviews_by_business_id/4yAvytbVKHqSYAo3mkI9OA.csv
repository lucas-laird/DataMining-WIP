158739,2016-06-10,0,4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"Hands down THE BESTTTTTTT kabob place in Vegas maybe even in all of the west coast! 

Their ground beef kabobs are sooooo good and their meat kabobs were nice and tender and super flavorful but the key to an afghan restaurant is the rice and the mantu and OH MY GOSH it was sooooooo good 

After eating I usually pick and choose what I was crazy about and what i am not so crazy about or even dislike and after eating food from this restaurant I literally couldn't even say one dish was just ok because everything was delicious! 

Their meat is all organic and grain/grass fed and their bread oh man their bread is perfect

I will def. be going back here (I will post pictures next time it was too late this time :( ) and letting all of my friends, family members, and even strangers know about this restaurant. 

I almost forgot to add that their prices are also amazing for the amount and quality of food they provide you with.

#4 Lamb Kabob Teka includes a heap of soft rice, seasoned with spices and topped with shredded carrots and raisins, similar to a biriyani, as well as a small side salad and a piece of pita. The highlight is obviously the lamb, a small but delicious portion of nicely seasoned and perfectly medium-rare meat. 
#6 Mantu is a traditional steamed beef dumpling dish topped with a mix of sauces, including a yogurt/sour cream, a red (tomato based?) sauce, vegetables, and fresh cilantro. Skins were nicely cooked and held up, filling was ample, flavors were homey and comforting. I'm not familiar with dumplings in Persian cuisine, but it would be cool to see if these could be offered pan-fried to nicely crisp and blister the skins for even more flavor.

Restaurant seems to be family owned and operated, location is clean. The lady who helped us during our visit was very polite and helpful. Looking forward to coming back for more lunch specials until I make my way through the whole menu!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,11,4,NZ-IueIIoSr9Wz5S0PJ-zg

2860820,2016-09-09,0,4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"I really enjoyed this place - my girlfriend did too. I went here based on a Las Vegas Weekly Review. The cover of the article said ""Afghani dumplings"" and I am a sucker for dumplings and dumpling-like food stuff - be it potstickers, wontons, gyoza, kreplach, etc. 

The article was talking about the mantu. They were beef with a really good yogurt and tomato sauce with some other vegetables floating around. Definitely tasty and the yogurt tasted really good with the meat and tomato.

We also tried a beef kabob and another chicken kabob plate to share. These were also suggested by the article and they were good suggestions. The chicken had a nice crispiness and the beef was tender. Both were seasoned well. We got one plate with the plain, white rice and another with the brown rice with carrots and raisins (it had some local name but I'm not going to try and remember it). Both of the rices were good but the one with carrots and raisins was the definite standout and overwhelmingly favored by my girlfriend.

The green sauce they give you is a great with a nice spiciness. Another reviewer called it ""cilantro/avocado"" - sure we'll roll with that. Whatever it was, it was tasty.

Finally, my girlfriend got the yogurt drink. For real, that slop was straight nasty! It tasted like a pureed version of a cucumber salad that I make. The cucumber salad I make is great, but I don't want to drink it. However, I'm not really letting this affect my rating. It was only $2 and the rest of the food more than made up for the initial misstep. And, I'm sure someone likes that drink. I mean, the same kind of person who takes cold showers and may or may not burn small animals...but someone, right?

I would definitely eat here again. I only don't give a 5-star not because of the restaurant itself but because if everything gets a 5-star (what should represent perfection or, at least, near-perfection) then it dilutes the rating system.",ZLTHICnSurX7PxL9hgsF-w,0,0,4,bNyTUXkh8t5theSuXbXvTg

The google direction is not very accurate. It is in the shopping center where Carl's Jr and Sprint are located. This place serves authentic Afghan food. 

The place is clean and casual with some seatings. It is family owned and operated. 

We found this place through restaurant.com but they don't take the gift certificate anymore. The owner is nice and friendly and gave us teas and deserts for the inconvenience.

Lamb chops only $12.99 was well-seasoned with cumin, each of the three pieces are nicely seared, bursting with juicy flavor of meat inside. The kabob plates came with salad, pita bread and delicious pilaf with raisins and shredded carrots.

The housemade traditional (chatni gashneez)--an acidic cilantro/vinegar chutney was amazing.

The prices on the menu were very affordable with big portions. We will definitely be back!",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,3,0,5,_x9iAf4RkcAKEZSpBQHmmA

3575626,2016-06-27,2,4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"Yes!! Another place in the area I can eat healthy and delicious.
This place is Afghan, not Iranian so the taste is a little different. 
I asked the owner what's the healthiest on the menu. He said everything on their menu is healthy. Their beef is lean, their lamb is lean and their chicken is chicken breast. I decided to go with the chicken kabob teka. (Nothing is leaner than chicken breast, right?)
Wow, it was absolutely delicious!! Came with a little salad, a grilled tomato, pita bread and a lot of rice. Even though the chicken was breast (white meat), it was not dry at all. How did they make chicken breast so tender and juicy?! Their avocado sauce was nice and spicy. I liked it. They use special rice in this place. It's some sort of special Afghan rice they pay $60 for 40 lbs. (gasp!! Really??) The rice was seasoned well and flavorful with raisins and shredded carrots but it was way too much rice. I couldn't finish it. I would rather have more salad than the rice since I'm trying to eat healthy...
The owner, Waleed was a very nice guy. They have a couple of lady employees here (his wife?) and they are from Afghanistan. Hope they get more business... When I came here, I was the only one eating in at 12:30 pm. (Well, it was Monday though.)

3810791,2016-06-29,1,4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"Today was either Afghan Chicken Kabob or Peruvian Chicken.

Peru Chicken was empty so I walked past it and went straight to Pro Kabob few meters away.  A couple was just walking out the door when I walked in and found few guys waiting for their orders (to go) and a group of guys seated waiting for their food to be served.  The place was clean and very unassuming.  I assumed the owners/chefs were the couple behind the counter.  

Their menu is very simple and straightforward and reasonably priced.  I ordered (to go) the Chicken Kabob which came with a huge serving of pulao (or palaw),  lettuce with avocado dressing, grilled half tomato, obi naan,  and a decent serving of well marinated, perfectly cooked juicy chicken (breast) cubes.  I personally enjoyed the pulao, the afghan pilaf.     It was on point!  It was perfectly seasoned with herbs and spices, mixed in with fried raisins and shredded carrots. And with their serving portion, I could've easily just ordered it sans chicken and still enjoyed it.  I assumed the meat was marinated in yogurt so it came out very tender, moist and juicy.  

The wait, however, was bit long. Well, i waited almost half an hour.  Though  I  appreciate the male owner/chef coming out when they handed me my food and apologized for the long wait.  

I would definitely come back and try their beef kabob, bolani (their version of quesadilla) and mantu (dumplings).",W9C7l46Me0iuzbio_0BhdQ,3,2,5,EGa1h_jcb7hVoVhLngUhlw

Its a newer restaurant so it wasn't very busy but I'm sure that will change very soon! 

Ok enough background and onto the real beef( or lamb?). Very simple menu and decor, but very friendly staff. I, of course, went for the lamb chops priced at only $12.99! Immediately I began preparing my taste buds for dry over cooked chops. I even ordered it to go just in case I couldn't finish it because it was bad lol Nothing against this place but I didn't expect much for the price. When I received the order, I could literally see the juiciness from the chops and the rice smelled fantastic! I dug in and within a few minutes it was all gone! It was that good!

The owner and staff are unfailingly friendly. If you want a real treat, try the lamb chops for dinner. They're outstanding!

They have a small menu, which really means they're focused on what they do best. Everything looks and tastes like it's homemade. Most of it is traditional, but they have a few American fusion items too - like the delicious kebob philly sandwich. The prices are quite reasonable.

I got the lamb kabob ($10.99) and my date got the chicken kabob ($8.99).

Both the lamb and chicken were perfectly flavored and extremely tender. The saffron rice was a total hit with shredded carrots and raisins on top...exactly how it should be. 

The star of the show was the homemade cilantro/avocado dressing in the bottle that they bring out with your meal as it compliments the dish perfectly. It's great with the rice, great with the salad and outstanding with the lamb. I'd dip chicken wings and sushi in that sauce if the culinary world would allow.

Persian food, in general, is a healthy alternative I often overlook and Pro Kabob does it as well as anyone for a very reasonable price.

Don't overlook this place.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,7,5,5,RidUpr5GJliPdreyP46Iow

The restaurant was very clean and well kept and They also have comfy seating. Will definitely be coming back again soon.",0pipGS0dkdxjP-YcyU6Opw,0,0,5,9-O5ziumDVlJ9pBFDHRemQ

5369503,2017-07-14,0,4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"I returned on my next I noticed the quality of the beef was better more tender than the last time. The meat was a bit chewy but this time I could tell the quality of the beef is better they're using a better cut of meat and tender. 

I wanted also to try the boolani in the pics with the greens but they told me that In Vegas they can't acquire the the greens that is actually used, in that type of boolani. So we stuck with the original boolani with potatoes and onions and spices. 

Also I was a bit disappointed in the fact that both times  I came here they didn't put shredded carrots and raisins like the pics. I know from talking to my Afghani friends that the raisins and carrots are traditional way of serving the rice. So I hope the next time or just hopefully they are consistent like  the pics.  

Overall not bad the flavors are there",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,4,9AJiPbmNYKM0QS28hV96uQ

I've picked chicken kabob teka, the dish was delicious and the plate is pretty big.
In addition to great meal I've been enjoying the family business atmosphere- I appreciate a lot this part in restaurant business! Generally, if you want to enjoy real authentic Persian dishes- Pro Kabob is the place number one in town.",aHMjNgcHW7SWeIuUA4AzuQ,0,0,5,7juWvU1bFXOI6DghskRn0A

5432651,2016-08-02,2,4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA,"I've tried Moroccan food and tried Persian food, this was actually Afganistani food and it was grrrrreatttt!

In the summer desert heat in Vegas (on West Sahara Ave haha) it was like eating traditional Afgan food without having to travel there!  And the owners were really friendly. 

Tried the Beef Kebob Teka which was really flavorful and cooked on a kebob and came with this rice side that was really good.  Mild, suble taste but the raisins (I think) gave it a unique flavor!

Also had the Boolani vegetable pancake which came with unlimited Avocado sauce.  It was a little spicy but loving avocados, it was fine.  

And lastly had the Mantu vegetable dumpling.  It's usually beef but they said they could prepare it vegie which was really good!  The dumplings sat in a curry type sauce which reminded me of Thai curry not not quite.

Anyway, this place is a winner and the owners are really nice.  If you want something different with great value - check out Pro Kebob - only 10 minutes off the strip!",wsv4eiRRog12yKSUwrl2TQ,4,2,5,_VEDu5ehtRwEO5nA9TN-fA
