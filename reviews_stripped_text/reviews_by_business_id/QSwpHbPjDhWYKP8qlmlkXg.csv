By the end of the night our whole party thought they were celebrities. Vegas All Nite facilitated one of the greatest family memories that we will always cherish. No request was to big or to small.

I knew I wanted to take my sister and bridal tribe to Thunder from down under, and Greg was able to create a specific package that worked for us. I spoke to alot of different promoters and other concierge companies, but Greg doesn't compare to anyone else. He wants to ensure that you are taken care of, and will not charge an arm and a leg for these packages.

The drivers were professional, fun and very flexible.  They were in time and everything can be paid ahead of time so there is no hassle on the night of your event.  You receive an invoice with your payment details at time of booking and a courtesy call prior to your event.

We also use Greg and his team to help set up bottle service at a night club.  It was seamless and the experience was fantastic!

I will certainly use them again!",fFNSz7eZpyJDUJPLSBdNEg,0,0,5,ccNQMEbYGVCwB9sWd0WndA

2180644,2014-07-01,0,QSwpHbPjDhWYKP8qlmlkXg,well I am back and here is the rest  of the story. Everything was awesome. The tickets we got for David Copperfield were unbelievable. We had a last minute call to Greg to help us get tickets to a show that was sold out and he was able to get all 9 of us into the show without any issues. It was a few text messages and bam it was done. Lastly Greg hooked us up with a VIP host at the Mix lounge who showed us the experience of a life time. We were treated so well and all of the promises made to us were fulfilled. My recommendations are if you go to Vegas and aren't sure what to do or what to see please reach out to Vegas all Nite and ask for Greg.,ERqtZGkLC4JqQxfZNWm0IA,0,0,5,Jkn1G-pqNdFFUvzM71dm7A

I was able to call and thankfully get the booking switched to an airport drop off rather than the original airport pickup. Not saying this could happen for everyone, but if it wasn't for some luck and quick action from the owner, I think I would have been out some money and no fancy ride.

2763554,2018-06-06,0,QSwpHbPjDhWYKP8qlmlkXg,"Working with Vegas All Nite was a easy as it gets. I asked for a specific thing, was offered several packages that would suit my party of 32 and together decided on the best deal for our group. After our initial conversation, mostly all correspondence was easily handled through email and text.  Payment was easily handled through pay pal which also makes it easy to pay from the same place in which most coordinators receive money for large parties/groups.  Our driver, Billy, was on time and even provided cups, ice,  napkins and water.  He even suggested the best routes for the stops we wanted to make and was flexible with our time arrangement.  Once on the bus, he allowed us to play the music we wanted via a bluetooth speaker set-up right from a mobile phone. Luckily for us, we had a classmate who is a well respected DJ with us and so that made the experience even greater.  I love the fact that we got everything we asked for and even a little of what we didn't ask for. We took care of a driver with an additional tip for being so awesome, taking care of our group and getting us back safely to our destinations. If ever in Vegas hosting a large or small group - go with Vegas All Nite.  You get exactly what you want PLUS extra.  I would definitely use them again.

2830980,2017-09-29,0,QSwpHbPjDhWYKP8qlmlkXg,"Here's my update as promised:

Before the wedding:
Bride squad picked up in Hummer stretch limo and dropped off at our chapel. Groom Squad picked up and dropped off.

We opted not to use their refreshments package due to we already were content from our bridal suite luncheon and our groom's poker party luncheon. Our wedding wasn't until 7:30pm and we didn't want our wedding party wasted before the I Do's. 

Post-wedding: 
Shuttles for EVERYONE to return to the hotels (strip and off-strip).

Our transportation was handled very well by Greg. We even got a last minute free upgrade due to a cancellation by another party. Due to the Labor Day holiday weekend Vegas All nite needed to use third-party vehicles for our post-wedding shuttles. 

Pros: Super Easy communication with Gregory. Great pricing. Nice vehicle options. 
Cons: The third-party shuttle that was assigned to me and my guy (Bride and Groom) had some irritating SNAFU'S. See my Bell Transportation review. 

Overall, Vegas All Nite provided awesome service in the planning stages and the wedding day. 

I was going to say if I got married again I would use Vegas All Nite, but HELLO! I'm only getting married one time. 

So, let me say this, if I am in Las Vegas for another cool event and we need sweet transportation, then Vegas All Nite it is! If I'm part of a bachelorette party and I help plan the event and it's in Vegas, then you know who I'm going to call. But, I'm older and all my friends and family are married so there goes that. 

So, if we're in Vegas and we want to turn up for...just because...Vegas All Nite!

Thanks again Greg for making everything so easy for us. It truly was a pleasure working with you.",H0jnKdJIK4s6eqUzsDsrAw,0,0,5,HUb52kpFC8yTqOGMegq11w
2942382,2017-08-08,0,QSwpHbPjDhWYKP8qlmlkXg,"I found VEGAS ALL NITE through Yelp. In planning my epic birthday party in Vegas, I realized I need transportation for all my friends (19 people) from the restaurant to the Hard Rock, where we all had tickets to see Magic Mike Live. I'm budget conscious, but I also want everyone to have a good time, especially because not everyone knew one another. After reading reviews for VEGAS ALL NITE, I sent them a message on Yelp. Yelp also allowed me to send the same message request to other vendors, which would help me price match. Out of all of the vendors I contacted, VEGAS ALL NITE was not only quick, but personal in their response. One of the vendors just referred me to their website for info, and the others responded with a copied and pasted price. Gregory Miller, the owner of VEGAS ALL NITE, reached out to me in a personable way, and communicated with me quickly, answering all my questions. After receiving quotes from the vendors, his price was the best and most practical for my needs. I needed some time to decide, and the date I needed transportation was closing in quick. Gregory was extremely helpful in helping me make my decision for a 24 seat party bus (over the 22 seat stretch Hummer), and I'm so glad we went with it. It was easy to pay for the bus and include the tip over the phone, and I received documents via e-mail - invoice, contract, etc. The day of, I communicated with them and received a text from the driver so I could keep in touch as well. The PARTY BUS from VEGAS ALL NITE was one of my favorite parts of the weekend. The driver was friendly and helpful, and everyone had a great time. I highly recommend VEGAS ALL NITE and plan to book with them for my next outing in Sin City! Thanks so much, Gregory and staff!",_UR7Oz7FkCiTEKG8F-GvXw,1,1,5,VPH755EJCLWsoZNuJ770Qg

We used his transportation for a group of 54 people on a company sales incentive trip. This includes transportation to and from the airport, and a multitude of excursions for different groups. While planning, I was on the east coast and felt extremely comfortable and confident that Vegas All Nite would deliver exceptional service... and they exceeded my high expectations! We even had a flight delayed and Greg picked up our guests in his personal vehicle. 

I couldn't be happier with the drivers too. They we're all on time, found our guests, made sure all parties were on the vehicle before departure and the vehicles were all spotless!

 I really appreciated that they looked into all flights and found ways to help us save $ by combining groups! I honestly don't have words for how beautiful this company is run. My previous quote was triple the price of Vegas All Nite.",W49ufAFT5qDui-OU3xxtsQ,0,0,5,NLX8n1evB4_87fEzUDlfXQ

4279121,2017-10-27,0,QSwpHbPjDhWYKP8qlmlkXg,"Great service and company! Quick to respond to any questions regarding service (I asked many). Diego F. was an outstanding chauffeur and host for our ""Thirty and Thirsty"" Crew. I surprised my friend for her birthday with a Escalade Mini Limo! She was throughly surprised and we had 2 bottles of cold champagne on our ride down the strip and to our hotel. The only negative thing I have to say is that unfortunately our flight was delayed 3 hours (Frontier/awful horrible experience please don't fly with them) and when our airplane landed (wheels touch the ground) our time starts for the 1 hour we have to get to our hotel in the limo. There just so happen to be another airplane in our terminal so we were there sitting for 45 min before even the first person got off the airplane. When we got to Diego at the baggage claim he told us our hour was already up and we didn't even get to see the limo! It's unfortunate because I had planned my money accordingly in Vegas and wasn't ready for this set back, but I didn't want to disappoint my birthday girl so I told him to add another hour so we could at least make it to our hotel. Diego said he would ask if he could do it by the 1/2 hour but was unable to. He definitely accommodated us as he could and had an Aux cord for us to play DJ which was cool. I just wish there was a better way for this company to accommodate us... maybe with delayed flights the customer could call when actually exiting the airplane? So things like this don't happen to another customer. We did do round trip, our ride back was nice. Our driver ""Rico"" was very nice, however he didn't have our bottle of champagne I had asked for set up. We had to ask about it, he didn't see it on our reservation... after he checked it he then gave us the bottle and glasses. I still highly recommend this company but I wanted to share my experience so future customers will have an even better experience if they so happen to have the few hiccups like we did.",mtG-nzNG69U4RO-2jgJdUw,0,0,4,AxsJoUr_jl-gM-BXzOIRmg
