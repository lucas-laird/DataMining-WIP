I ordered an apple bear claw and it was delicious without being too sweet or dry. I wished they offered macaroons so if anyone is reading this, please add these to your pastries.
I couldn't believe a banana costs $2 bucks. I guess I prefer to pay for overpriced pastries than I do for fruit.

We ordered a roast beef panini, 2 bags of chips, and a large mint tea and it came to $24.35. Super high for normal rates, but appropriate for Vegas.

No other staff offered to assist or acknowledged that I was there.

The ""kids"" working the counter have no idea what service is. I walked up to the counter to get some hot tea. And one girl greeted me right away with what would u like? I say I'm looking... There is no one else in line behind me but not even a minute later the same girl asks me with attitude what I would like.  So I ask her if the tea is a loose leaf or bagged.  She answered that it is loose leaf but I see no French presses in sight.... So I ask her how is it served. She kind of rolls her eyes and says uh its served in a cup as she points to one of their cups. At this point I'm wondering how u serve loose tea with no French press an no tea pot in sight. 

Well apparently they do not know the difference between loose leaf tea and bagged tea since the tea that they have me was a bagged tea.  When I asked the girl that answered loose leaf tea.... She said... ""Uh its loose leaf in a bag""....uuummmm.... The last time I looked that was called BAGGED tea! Duh!

Then as I was walking off a lady came up to the gelato counter and asked the guy what the difference between ice cream and gelato was. He starts the answer with well gelato is cream based.... Seriously do they not train their staff at all???

Then as I was walking out of there about 15 minutes later.... There are 4 of them huddled together by the counter talking a mile a minute while all the tables in the coffee shop are filthy.  Really???

The first time I came here, I was the only person in line. Although there was not a single person in front or behind me, I had to wait 5 MINUTES for the 2 girls at the register to finish their conversation about their boyfriends. When they finally decided to take my order, they gave me a dirty look asking ""what do you want..."", as if I was taking away from their precious time together.  They didn't thank me for my business either.  They just turned back around and continued gabbing about their love lives. How romantic. 

This morning, I came by to get my coffee. There was a male cashier that was friendly, but the coffee was lukewarm. When I realized this in my hotel room, I came back down and asked if they had a microwave to heat it up. There was a female cashier helping me this time, and she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if I could get another coffee that I could see was just being brewed at the time, and they said no & I would have to pay their ridiculous prices again.

Beautifully strong roasted coffee with a kick. Their iced mochas and vanilla iced mochas were amazing!  Their cold brew was a little watered down but still better than Starbucks/coffee bean.

I'd say that while some people here are complaining about the staff and ""service"", my drinks from here were fast and flavorful, and the staff were good about taking my vouchers from the SLS' VIP lounge, so nothing to complain about there.

As for the beverages themselves - my fave would have to be the masala chai latte.  Strong and spicy, it helped knock back a sore throat in a matter of minutes and helped me get back on my feet when I needed it.  As for the food, their apple turnover is a great breakfast snack not to be overlooked.

Sometimes just having the basics is all a coffee shop in a hotel really needs to keep the gambling, rambling, and scrambling masses happy. 

I stopped in here to get a little pick-me-up before a meeting I had in the vicinity. The coffee here is decent, I would go as far to say better than Starbucks, which isn't saying much. I mean you cover anything in enough foam, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream and I'm sure it will taste pretty damn good. Go ahead, try it, throw some of those goodies on an old piece chicken or a day old taco... I'll wait. Ok, maybe not those food items, but mixed in with some overly strong and burnt coffee and it does the trick. 

Like I was saying the coffee here is very good. Not only do they offer straight up  coffee, but they also offer espresso, mocha lattes, iced coffee, and varying degrees of caffeinated happiness. They also have stuff for the hunger pains, the basics like breakfast sandwiches and fruit plates.

Staff: slow, stupid, ignorant, inconsiderate, and inexperienced bunch that they need to be yelled at. 


Quality: good thing they are the only coffee place in there because their coffee taste worst than Starbucks. That's really hard to do.  

Service: when we ordered our drink two cashiers were just incredible idiots.  If you are in loud place like sls shitty hotel. You need to speak up.  Could not hear. So i told her you need to speak up. She says I have been calling you, you just didn't hear me. (with attitude) Yay for service!

Price: for a hotel who advertise upscale blah blah, it is very expensive compared to its quality

Wait time: ridiculous. The people who ordered iced mocha before us waited 20 minutes to get their drinks. When my wife got hers, she was given another person's order. Same drink but other person's was bigger so my wife said that wasn't hers. Had to check the other orders that came out to find the right drink.

Now I need to tell you how much they clean their equipment if simple grinder can not be cleaned, can you imagine what you are drinking out of? 

I am posting a picture so check it out when you get a chance.


If you think these actions are okay by the customers you do not have the right to be one. Most of the people in US would wait for their drinks as if it was normal and it is not a problem, but that is why people take advantage of you like this.  People when you are not happy about something you need to speak up and say ""I am not taking this bs from you"" then complain the f&$@ out.",yWRETSeAH8fk9B8FItAQAg,1,0,1,gGhY9kqff0EAK1_7_7QVUA

Cons: Service was slow. Not enough people working. Barista was not friendly.

The prices are not the cheapest but the convenience makes up for it, especially if you are staying or playing in the property.

Fast and friendly service. The iced coffee here is plenty tasty. Some pastries, salads, fruits, gelato and snacks available too. Expect casino prices though. Very convenient and close enough to the elevators. I don't get so many of the bad reviews here. I think some people are just never satisfied with anything and need to get over themselves a bit.

You can also place items bought here on your room charge. So winning when you're hungover and stumble out of your room forgetting to bring your wallet, cash, or even forget to wear pants.

Not that I did that. Maybe......",YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,5,4,4,211rTU1vObnFAp12Fl51eg

Located just past the entrance of the new SLS and slinging LAMill Coffee from 6am until ten o'clock in the evening every day of the week it was largely a result of my early arrival for breakfast at The Griddle Café that brought me to the cusp of The Perq and although I knew the meal to follow was bound to be hearty I simply couldn't resist the combination of warm pastries and welcoming baristas, the results a three part order tasted on site and finished later in the day with across-the-board impressive results.  In some ways a bizarre space with a long bar juxtaposing the coffee counter and several small tables laid out beneath a textured ceiling gleaming with light The Perq concept is one set to evolve with progression of the day and reportedly baking fresh every ninety minutes (or faster as supply demands) with breakfast transitioning to lunch around 11:00am it was to nearly a dozen warm options that I was tempted at 6:15 and although a pair of fruit tarts beckoned along with a truffled Gruyere scone my order eventually settled on items far more sweet, the fresh scone pocketed with spots of sugar and dollops of butter alongside dark chocolate and bursting berries providing a lovely first bite before I delved into a well laminated bearclaw filled with dense yet subtle frangipane that stands tall alongside that of Henderson's Friendly Donuts for best in the city, though the Strip based Casino admittedly commands nearly three times the price.  Indulging last in a selection warmed-and-topped-to-order it was finally in The Perq's caramel topped banana monkey bread that I partook and although rumor has it that lunch fares even better than breakfast with cookies, desserts, and gelato-panini taking center stage I'd be hard pressed to imagine any of them better than the textbook brioche pull-apart studded with caramelized bananas, though I unquestionably plan to return and find out, and next time with a cold-brew in hand.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,4,UBrpr_fU9HtpA_Q2xGVCOg

I was expecting more, seeing how expensive this place is ($6 for a medium latte....and the guy got it wrong....I wanted a small...but whatever). Over priced. Tasted burned.

They have all different types of lattes here, coffee and thankfully also serve almond milk which is a plus for me as it's pretty much the only way I'll order a latte. They also have gelato and they change up the flavors according to the seasons. I went during the fall and they had a pumpkin flavored one that was delicious!

Only a few breakfast sandwich options which I didn't see posted anywhere. Fully acknowledge I could have missed them but they should probably be posted more prominently. Lucky us, the cashier was quite friendly and helpful & gave us the low down on the options. 
Prices are high, Coffee is hot in addition to good. It's a to go place. Not a ton of grab & go bar options but lots of danishes. They also have smoothies and specialty coffees. Reliable spot and glad it's here if you need a quick bite in order to dash. As with most hotels, the in room coffee just doesn't cut it so this is nice to have.

I just wanted pastries for breakfast and I opted for the apple turnover. It wasnt that great. The apples were pretty sour and the pastry dough itself left something to be desired. I shoulda went with the almond bear claw. And the prices on the pastries are not cheap as they are the only option of this type inside the SLS. So they def have the market on coffee shop goods. They also have gelato, small snacks and bottled juices & water. Service could have been better as well. It was Sunday am and the line wasnt even that long yet and the cashier couldnt even muster up a smile...

For myself and my coworker combined breakfast was around 35-50/day. For what we got, the value just want there. The staff works at a glacial pace and they got my poor coworker's order wrong each day! They didn't write the order on each food order so we didn't notice what we had until she bit into it. She's very easy going and didn't complain, but when it happened the second day in a row, it's really disappointing. 

Breakfast is pretty much pastries or Mexican breakfast. The Mexican breakfast was mediocre at best and was crazy expensive. Don't make the same mistake we did. Move along and don't give it a second look.",bp2SRmio3RIR0IgX9h3sOw,0,0,2,X9HdythekNTzp25RPugHzw

I waited patiently for this place to be open even after 6am but gave up when it was evident that the workers were busy having a drawn out conversation instead of opening. Instead, I went to the Griddle Cafe to get some food and by the time I came back, it was still not open. If the hotel advertises The Perq to be open at 6am, it should be open at 6am.

I wanted to give this place a second chance so I came back another day in the morning. There was a decent size line. Unfortunately, all the croissants and pretty much all the food for that matter was gone. It was definitely slim pickings in terms of pastries. I was disappointed that I didn't get to eat. Instead I had purchased a pumpkin spice latte. It was okay, but would have preferred it from Starbucks across the street.

Coming to Perq (I refuse to say the ""the"" in front), is plenty worth the wait.  You see, your kinda held captive, as it's the only offering of coffee in the hotel.  The line on weekends is 10-20 deep on weekends, so there's no quick fix.

A small bakery selection, and all the regular stuff (espresso, lattes), with one special feature, a Liquor Affogato, and I can only imagine what its like.
