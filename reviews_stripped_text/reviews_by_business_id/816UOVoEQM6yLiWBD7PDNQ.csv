Every freaking 10 min and they would say ""ok 20 min"" ""ok 3-4 min"" and kept us like that for one hour!!! They wouldn't write anyone down like any other regular restaurant. Then it came to be 8:45 pm, 15 min til closing time and they said ""yea I'm sorry we won't have any tables the only table we have fits 8 people"" 
Wow just wow.... Bad service, their servers and managers need to go through real training and they need to host. Most importantly, they need a designer! They supposedly remodeled, but they should hire a designer ASAP! The layout is terrible. I should call the fire department. 
I am most upset that they lied, they should have said since the beginning ""I'm sorry we have a terrible floor layout that only fits 8 people and I'm sorry we only have booths because that is the only thing that exists in restaurants"" call a design firm stop trying to design stuff according to your needs!",9nBL5d84lmefF6hDOZHk-A,0,0,1,Q36jR7SyFumvqy41D1zp2g

La comida esta muy deliciosa! Yo soy muy especial cundo se trata de restaurantes de Mariscos y comida Mexicana pero si que me quede sorprendida. Los trabajadores muy atentos a sus clientes. Por supuesto que regresaré cuando venga a las Vegas otra vez. Saludos desde California !",Eza5pPT7BqCAvg9RSeLcrg,0,0,5,pnPTpWT57InXn6JssIQRwQ

I have tried a variety of items on their menu, Tacos, Molcajetes, Seafood Tostadas and they're Potato Specialty. The restaurant is very clean and staff is very friendly and attentive. They also have a variety of aguas frescas , you have to try their Cebada and Jamaica one of the best I've had. I usually order the Tostada Mixta - has everything and it's piled on high and topped off with slices of avocado- or one of their hot Molcajete's also, loaded with shrimp, fish, cheese and steak! Yeah steak! sometimes I'll order both, yeah both! don't tell me how to live my life!  Lots of lime and chile un poquito de sal and you're golden. Their portions are huge and so good- trust me- you are about to need a nap afterwards. There's festive regional Banda music videos playing in the background and sometimes live Mariachis (mostly on weekends) will come in. Try this place! You will be super happy you did :)",G9EZTnK2YN2NU6Z9nPt6Sg,0,0,5,hxWloARY700iyGyjBP4cHg

By far this is the best mariscos restaurant in Las Vegas. I been coming back time after time. Excellent service small cosy spot. I had the mariscoco is amazing! All fresh seafood!",2mcRCcp7xNkG7-1qd1TIHQ,0,0,5,OJyK3cuJ-nOWQ2bQ7zBBRA
1340261,2015-02-03,5,816UOVoEQM6yLiWBD7PDNQ,"Round by round, el Canelo is the best Mariscos restaurant in Las vegas!
We started with the oyster shots, fresh oysters with tasty sauce and tequila, they definitely delivered their intended punch! We also had the marlin tacos quesadilla style and they were excellent! pure goodnes in a tortilla! They also serve mantaray tacos for those looking for something more on the exotic and out of the ordinary, and like 99.9% of all the other other exotic meats they don't taste like chicken. The seviche tostadas needs more fish/shrimp and less cucumber salad but other than that they're delicious. 
Place is small but comfortable and clean (with an A rating from the health department.) Theres a couple of TVs playing corrido videos adding to the classic marisqueria atmosphere and our waitress and manager/(owner?) were very friendly and attentive they really made us feel like home.
The only little problem was that they couldn't serve beer yet, they had the beer and the permit is been approved but they hadn't recived the actual certificate but once they do I'll be paying them child support. There's nothing better than mariscos, beer and corridos. Can't wait to go back and try the Malverde ostiones that the manager recommended she said those and the seafood molcajetes were their most popular dishes.
El Canelo, nothing to do with the famous Mexican boxer ( I asked ) with more seafood variety and the freshest flavors than the competition, wins by a culinary knockout.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,6,6,4,rw9Pqzi3DmrhtoIrOv6y8Q

The horchata so good. The bad side: loud music, I couldn't have a conversation and the service is nice lady, but the food is served so slow. Not sure why so slow the service. Overall, I recommend the place but be patient with the time they take to serve you.",8TyAAhpneXVgxuQidiiKKg,0,0,4,Wr08MCOgpVYd5tYF75NurA

The bad: Service a little slow. Music too loud. Construction noise as well.

Will definitely be back, hopefully when they're done with their construction. :)",9wcRWOCi7aTqzR8d-7r4jQ,1,0,4,ulX1y0ooKIDtGTBnJfLZxQ
2457211,2015-11-08,0,816UOVoEQM6yLiWBD7PDNQ,"I was craving Mariscos for a while && a Michelada obviously. But I Honestly thought there was no place that was good here in Vegas until a cousin recommended ""El Canelo."" M first time going, I was pretty scared to order, the owner came greeted us and also told us their specialties. I love spicy food so when he told me about the Molcajete Diablo I was sold. This place is freaking amazing!!! Best Micheladas ever!! The Food is great, prices are even better. The service is this restaurant is great, super attentive makes you feel like your home. SINALOENSE style seafood, yes exactly just like my hometown. Just to think of all that food makes my mouth water!. Seriously recommend it to everyone.",xCDTlnkFR0H3lQBSr0A3zA,0,0,5,CBgJIqUB1P2yYNdKbXIJzQ

3138796,2015-05-12,0,816UOVoEQM6yLiWBD7PDNQ,I go to this place for the molcajetes omg they are so delicious. I get the seafood one with tilapia and shrimp cooked in various ways. Recently I began ordering the marlin taco as well and that's delicious too. They have the fanta drinks in the glass bottle which adds to the experience. Every time I have come from there was only 1 or 2 waitresses which seemed to be more than enough. I always feel well taken care of. I'm sure this restaurant has a lot to offer but the molcajetes are so good I don't think I'll be able to explore more of the menu,6ol_Jj9Wj1njSoy0TZBiXA,2,1,5,MX4cfe9Tml0U160VK0-YAg
3184086,2015-09-26,1,816UOVoEQM6yLiWBD7PDNQ,This place is not what we saw on tv. Came from Laughlin to try this place out and we were not impressed. The flavor of all 4 of our dishes were not anything to write home about. The only dish that I enjoyed was the kids carne asada w/ mashed potatoes and cheese. Good luck and hope that helps.,IHmnZrtbh-966GFE1srrxg,1,0,1,i-AL1CvZ3ihiN-osu4HV1A

5531294,2016-01-04,0,816UOVoEQM6yLiWBD7PDNQ,"Came here earlier today hoping I would get some good seafood. I had a light breakfast so I was starving when we got here. On a Sunday afternoon there were 2 other groups so there was a lot to choose from for seating. When we sat in a booth the whole area smelled like it was cleaned with a dirty rag. 

They took our drink orders and brought them out  quick. We ordered a shrimp cocktail and a shrimp taco. I will agree with other reviewers the they have very slow service, those 2 items took about 25 minutes to come out on a day they weren't even busy. The shrimp taco was cold made up of 3 shrimps a whole bunch of vegetables. The cocktail was flavorless I had to add salt and limon to add flavor. After ordering a beer, agua de horchata, coke bottle, a taco, and a cocktail it came to 30 bucks. 

It was pretty bad....bad enough that I've been feeling sick I don't think I'll be back.",Lqa-U3bSO1wtYXnHLLjXCg,1,1,1,xHoF_2gktVXMvBvx4hMRSA
