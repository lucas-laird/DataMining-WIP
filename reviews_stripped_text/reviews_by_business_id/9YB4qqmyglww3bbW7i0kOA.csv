Had the fried rice, sesame cucumbers and pot stickers  everything was delicious although I wish the cucumbers were served in a larger portion. 

I was able to find parking right  in front but I bet it could be a challenge during peak times.

1673262,2018-06-25,11,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"Steaming hot bowls of ramen in the heat of a Vegas summer?! Not my idea of a good time, but their $3 promo lured me in with a group of friends. Things got even hotter when we discovered that their broth is also kicked up with spices, adding another level of heat to the situation.

I ordered the Miso, medium, and added an egg. What I received was tolerably spicy but unfortunately, the spice covered up any other flavors. There were plenty of included toppings (chashu, ground pork, bamboo, chive, garlic, peppers), but the chashu was extremely thinly cut, discounted price or not. 

But my main beef is that the hallmark of great ramen is the quality and depth of flavor in the broth. The noodles were thin but had the right chew, but I have no idea whether I was even served the correct broth I ordered because I couldn't taste anything else. As Bailey Z put it, I ate my food but I did not enjoy my meal.

With so many great ramen spots in town, it would take a friend suggesting this one for me to return. I hear better things about their other location, plus this one has a terribly crowded parking lot.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,15,3,6PzjYXLnU-UHL6n21E18iw
1904403,2018-06-24,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,Good pork soup alike the original in Japan. Love the shop environment and friendly service. Worth it but a bit disappointed that only one pork per noodle.,dGdTau0HPnCBzQ1qcFg46A,0,0,5,fJSl3knZ2bhlf19NvxrR7Q
2215663,2018-06-25,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"I love their grand opening promotions! I get to try alll of them. I personally LOVED the miso one, the taste are in great harmony. So even if it goes back to original price I would only pick the miso ramen. The least favorite is veggie ramen. Don't get me wrong, I love my veggies, it's just that the veggie soup base is suppose to be light in flavor. But they added oily greasy fried onions to the soup . That just doesn't go together. I think there could be other ways to enhance the flavor instead of fried onions. So the veggie ramen is what they need to work on to find the harmony in taste. Other than that, miso will be the top hit of this place.",bvHu6kqz44z9obSCQDLPfQ,0,0,4,c_PLs5BSvywIHoVW29LzgA
2330324,2018-06-30,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"Not sure ramen should cost this much after adding toppings. Some toppings were a bit overpriced, such as garlic, nori, corn & spinach. Pretty much end up with a $15-$20 bowl if you want to get full. I guess if you eat to just get satisfied by taste they are not bad. When I got my bowl with all the added toppings it looked the same size, slightly more than one without. So I wasn't too happy. Given they were busy, don't skimp me plz. I first tried to go on the grand opening and the wait was an hour. I didn't like that we couldn't get a to go order, forcing people to wait an hour in the Vegas heat wave. No waters offered to the patient guests. Not a good look at all. You might be packed out the door, but u must treat your loyal customers properly. Also a lot of pre bussing could've been done instead of having 3 staff members at the front door having you sign in yourself. 3 people up front and your making the guest sign them selves in while table need to be turned. Come on now, common sense. Training should've been done prior to grand opening, who's the front of house manager? Tsk*tsk*!
   I've had some other noodle spots like oodle noodle where all/most ingredients are made fresh and imported. The cost there is about $11-$12 lunch special with a yuzu soda (3 course with drink). I understand the noodles are not the same type. But as far as flavor and price there are a few others that top this spot hands down. I might give it another try but $20 for ramen after a bad first experience. Hmm, I wonder. Coin toss I guess. Till then 1 star, sorry.",G-lXqfGcJDRmi2iUXuj8Bw,0,0,1,D69iseQtRp59AmpkYlnIQA
2366420,2018-06-23,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"I ordered the Stamina shoyu ramen in chicken broth with soft boiled egg as the added $1.50 topping. The standard $8.95 ramen already comes with a generous amount of toppings which includes chashu pork, ground pork, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, nira chive, fried garlic, green chives & shredded chili pepper on the side. The broth tasted real good, savory without being salty. The noodles cooked just right and not mushy. Service was adequate and food quality and taste was superb considering the place was full since they were running $3.00 special on all ramen orders. I would definitely come back here again.",Oei8DbXNgB11KGuTaRgBQQ,0,0,5,n1aF1VObiCF1ETJmLc6e-w

So many places in Chinatown I get overwhelmed, but I just dived in today. Ramen Kobo is opening its 2nd location this weekend and has a $3 Ramen special!!! I have no basis for comparison, but this was delicious. I will definitely be exploring more in the future.

I had such a wonderful experience here. The gyoza, shrimp mayo and the fried rice. Was just simply amazing and on point. It's in Chinatown by Spring Mt and kinda Valley View. It's a restaurant that simply delivers on everything! Trust me this place will not disappoint you one bit. Go have a meal with friends or family.

2619340,2018-05-15,11,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"Grand opening is today 5/14/18! Ramen Kobo took over the Marugame Monzo location on Spring Mountain (sister company) we will miss udon monzo dearly but the location wasn't doing well. Also the parking at this location sucks. Its located in a congested strip mall and it gets super tricky during prime hours, so just be prepared for that.

Ramen Kobo already has another location in Vegas and they are doing pretty well with tried and true favorites.

I tried the tonkotsu ramen, gyoza, takoyaki and fried rice. They were all decent, but I definitely have had better. I think the flavor could be bolder on everything. My friend said they prefer the other location because it tastes better over there. I hope the chef gets the memo. 

But the service here was top notch! They were very good about beverage refills and making sure our table was tended to. I would try the older location before I come back to this location, so I know what my friend is talking about.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,15,14,3,C_EQGbifuWUHNr1fXMc_wA

The veggie ramen that a friend and I ordered was asked on a scale of spicy so I chicken out with asking for spice to be on the side while my friend asked for super spicy. Besides my nasal cavities opening up and crying just a little, the pain felt even better with a cold sake on the side. Our waiter gave us a small note  to read up on what type of sake we were drinking too which was helpful since I know nothing about sake but drinking it.",06o1DmiBoiyxI2q3v2QRbg,2,1,5,wwYkjohpsdNs80WeYLhUfA

Their Stamina Tonkatsu ranks up there with some of the best I've tried outside of Japan. We also had the karaage with rice. The flavor is good and the meat is juicy. We'll definitely be back as we saw a couple sizzling dishes go by to other tables as we were leaving. One was a gyoza and I'm not sure about the other. 

Service was very attentive. Always made sure our drinks were full and made it a point to check on us periodically throughout our meal. Many more dishes to try so we'll see you again soon!",Ou5obbkoCSZcZIt8Jku4Bw,0,0,5,5stO914biI7rPm_fH3S40g
3332731,2018-06-06,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"This is the newly opened second location for Kobo.  First impressions are larger menu, with an Izakaya food menu as opposed to only rice bowls and the notorious ramen.  Tons of one cup sake as well.

I had fire ramen as usual (miso broth this time).  Comparing to the Durango location, the both didn't seem as hot, but was bolder in the taste.  Lots of flavor in the broth and really tasty.  I substituted tofu into my ramen for no extra charge and was quite happy with the green onion, bamboo shoot, bean sprout, and mushroom already included complimentary in the $9 ramen bowl.  I tried the gyoza as well, which were fantastic.  Japanese style flip dumplings with charred bottoms and homemade dipping sauce made table side.  

As far as food goes, Kobo knocks it out of the park again. Best ramen in town and finally where it belongs in China Town to complete with the other top contenders in the city.  Hottest ramen in town; hopefully they keep expanding further towards the westside.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,2,0,5,OIAEuiN-N_o0AVBLNtibgw

We ordered the gyoza, two tonkatsu ramen, the pork bowl and the takoyaki.  So everything was pretty good for the most part.  The gyoza was nothing special I would not order it again.  The ramen was great we also got the black garlic on the side which was really good.  I liked the rice as well!  It is a solid place with good food and awesome service.  It is just like it's brother over on durango and sister counterparts like monta.  Great place good ramen.  Nothing super special though.

3742564,2018-06-24,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"I love the ramen here overall, but the reason I'm knocking them down a star is because this place is extremely inefficient compared to their Durango location and other ramen places in Vegas. 

I don't think they were prepared for how busy it was going to be on their grand opening. There were 3-4 tables open, but it took them really long to get people seated. The food also took over 20 minutes to get to the table after ordering.

3969931,2018-06-14,4,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"In between plays at the Fringe Festival at Las Vegas Little Theatre, two of us walked here for dinner.

I was more interested in the Izakaya section of the menu than the ramen.  I ordered potato pancakes and chashu buns along with an iced tea.  I wanted to see how much food that was before I went further.  They have canned green or oolong tea for iced tea.

The potato pancakes were good.  The small salad and dipping sauce were good, also.  Since I wasn't full, I asked our server, Keiko, about a couple of potential dishes.  I was looking for something that was not a large portion meant for sharing.  I ended up ordering their chopped octopus in wasabi sauce.  It was very good and the best of the three dishes I had.

Prices were OK.  I wish there was more selections on the Izakaya menu but that's not their main focus.

4207653,2018-06-27,0,9YB4qqmyglww3bbW7i0kOA,"Whenever a new ramen shop opens up in Vegas, you just go, even if its 108F outside! When we heard news that Ramen Kobo opened a location on Spring Mountain and was offering their signature ""Stamina Ramen"" for $3 we immediately jumped at the opportunity! They probably named it ""Stamina Ramen"" because you needed stamina to keep slurping your bowl to a finish. I ordered the spicy miso and was instantly greeted with yummy heat that scorched my taste buds into little minions--it's a good thing! The restaurant is nicely appointed and well-spaced for a ramen shop. At the time of our visit, Ramen Kobo is only offering their signature ramen due to the sheer volume of people cramming into the place for their ramen fix. But if people lining up is a tell tale of a good spot, it surely is: the ramen broth is deliciously savory (which you can kick up a notch with various spice heat levels, the in-house noodles are perfectly chewy, green onions plus bamboo shoots are generously portioned and the pork chasu is satisfying. My only small complaint was the almost hard-boiled nitamago--I prefer mine on the softer boiled side. Perhaps when the place is finally able to cope with the patrons, they'll settle down and make things even better. We can't wait to try everything else in their menu once the place is fully operational, especially the Izakaya portion of it, I'll update my review then to reflect it.",J4LGq7xYlHDfbfHbwbyK8Q,1,0,4,HbrQxb33EEpJr1jJ1q6IEg

The bad: the basic tonkotsu, instead of coming with two pieces of pork, comes with one piece and some salty ground pork that I did not care for. The soft boiled egg I ordered on it was more hard boiled and cold, not at all integrated in the dish. And the spinach add on is not at all worth it--1.50 for six pieces of spinach.
