476614,2015-10-22,3,lVULxfPrpjnlOzF_jilRAA,"First, the margarita deal via Groupon was a rip-off. They come out of a frozen drink machine, not hand made by any bartender! And very sugary with hardly any alcohol in them. Like a 7-11 slurpee! I ended up giving it away to someone in the street! The bummer was it took forever to even FIND the place -- walking in circles for almost an 45 minutes! With Venetian staff having NO clue where it was either. And the security guard had an idea but note: the Food Court (where it is) is NOT the same as restaurant row! So after 45 minutes of walking in circles ALL I wanted in the world was to down a huge margarita and it didn't happen. Next, the service....barely existed. The girls were not exactly friendly or welcoming, it was a bit disorganized and slow. Lastly, and their saving grace to not getting 1 star...is the food was surprisingly pretty good! We got burritos bowls -- one meat and one tofu! That was a plus, being a vegetarian, yay! there was something I could eat. It's NOT Chipotle but the food is good...definitely overpriced tho. Therefore, IF you find it, don't fall for margarita deal just get food...or save yourself, relax & sit down and eat at one of the many awesome restaurants in Venetian, not here.",0PDuIlK-VLy3oZNngNeaWQ,2,0,2,Y-4nGw5-FmtFnU8E6cE2Bg

2009953,2017-09-09,2,lVULxfPrpjnlOzF_jilRAA,"So I have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here; this food court establishment attached to a casino floor is putting out sub par, bland, inauthentic Mexican ""fast food"" at best. 

We ordered three enchiladas (extremely overpriced for what it is-but that's Vegas!) and they were ""made to order"" with a small amount of salsa, cheese, and choice of protein. Then they were wrapped up with a dash more salsa and put through an oven salamander (like at Quiznos to warm a sandwich) for a couple minutes and call it enchiladas; they were flavorless, the tortillas were dry and mostly unsauced by the salsa. Nothing resembling true enchilada flavors or actual enchilada sauce. The beans and rice were cooked well, but also very bland. 

The giant overpriced drinks came in three flavors and were an even bigger waste, even with a discount voucher; they were artificial, cloyingly sweet and didn't have even the slightest trace of booze or a balanced margarita. There are sooooo many other options for giant souvenir drinks on the strip- pick one of those over this place at all costs! They will put a quality drink from a better selection in your take home vessel. 

Accompanied by the very inauthentic drinks and food is disinterested and borderline rude service. I was snapped at by more than one employee, during ordering and check out. With the abundance of Mexican options and drinks at every turn anywhere on the strip, let's be real- I would still pick the Taco Bell Cantina down the street over this place as a last resort for half the price, and be much more in the true vibe of the Strip!",PVB0ggrspa1wWUECI7BN6w,3,1,1,uiM0MAvnyEmyjRpsNwPnbQ

This is really 2-3 stars but the price does not justify for the food. Def not worth it.

The set up is nice, all the sides are clearly visible. The meat, however is rather questionable. For some reason, they put their steak under some sort of liquid broth. I mean, I know steak is the more expensive protein and you don't want it to dry out, but to take strips of meat out of a liquid and plop it atop a mountain of nachos, dripping with liquid, is plain gross. 

Side note to manager-hire people who smile.",SUTPxXZ2jcvtNZdeB6l7VQ,1,0,2,0a9YuAfNo4kcx82T9zzJPg

In a resort with some of the finest dining in the city, this food court is an insult to any human with taste buds. 

We were on property for a show and we decided to grab a quick bite in the food court beforehand since we didn't have time for a sit down meal.

My mom and I decided to share some nachos and a drink since we weren't super hungry. I stood in line next to some extremely obnoxious spring breakers and ordered my meal. When I first asked for nachos, I watched the guy in back making chips from scratch, so I started to feel a little more optimistic about our food court decision, but feeling soon faded. The girl at the counter topped the freshly made chips with a sad amount of shredded cheese, ran it through the warmer and then asked if I wanted any salsas to go with that. Um, even for strip pricing I would expect a little more for my $10 than a sprinkling of cheese atop 20-30 chips... 

I asked her to add chicken and then proceeded to add every possible other topping I could think of to salvage this travesty of a meal. By the end, it looked decent enough. I paid and was on my way to the table my mom had secured.

One bite in and I was done. He chips tasted stale, despite watching the guy make them fresh and were so salty. The chicken was beyond dry and none of the salsas tasted like anything close to food. 

I cannot stress this enough, there are so many wonderful places to eat inside Venetian and Palazzo at the same price point or slightly more, that there is absolutely no reason anyone should need to eat at this pathetic little food court.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,3,1,qNshP8GK0G66VgmdzibY4Q
