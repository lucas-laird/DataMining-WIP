Also I dropped my drink and spilled it all over, the kid smiled and said ""no problems, that's what a mop is for."" I was happly surprised with their great attitudes.",naB-0VPvCnsjwJqlVVR-9w,0,0,4,1D9Kt5cTYCdqtCL85MuDzA

I'm pretty sure I could cut my own roast beef and make my own sandwich faster than they can here. Almost not worth the wait for fast food.,QkBlv0GaPNEw4wJH3b5Clg,0,0,2,XcH2gZhtwWTJZCfvmhujMQ

Cashier agreed with the coupon and my daughter wanted the 5 orders which is 15 sandwiches for 20 bucks for the b day party for the kids. Manager stepped in and said no, limit my daughter just 9. Wow!!! Six kids no Arby, how sad, Bad Manager.",Lt_lPsHJvJ6WntMl9Th5sA,0,0,1,b3YGXOjnCXbRRm_NI1yGSQ

There were 4 people in front of me.  20 minutes later, there were  still 4 people in front of me.  The manager, I think she was the manger, was yelling at one of the employees.  It was very demeaning, stating that if he could not do the job, to go sweep the lobby.  After that happened, I just took a picture of the telephone number they have to call about the restaurant, turned around and left.  That's probably the last time I will ever step foot in an Arby's.  All the people in the restaurant commented on how slow the service is and how rude that lady was.  I guess they only care about the drive-thru but not the customers standing in front of them.",rWjliOvlUT-P2V5L-zJFiQ,1,0,1,y27Jh8gQ9hcV2-hh7L5PLg

With that being said though, I did end up signing up for their email alerts because I figured if my husband was going to eat here so often it would be good to get some deals on the food. They do send out some pretty decent coupons every once and awhile. PLUS - they sent me a FREE milkshake coupon for my birthday. I decided we had to go a few days ago so I could redeem my coupon.

First off this location is in the ghetto on Boulder Highway. Luckily, the restaurant itself is actually quite clean and well kept. The lobbies in Arby's tend to look a little more ""swank"" (HA HA) than most other fast food establishments. They have mood lighting and cooshy benches to sit on while you dine. 

Second - We went and their shake machine was out of business. *womp womp womp*. The entire reason I came was busted, but of course, my husband still wanted a sandwich. We ordered one and a side of Mozzarella Sticks. I know it's just fried cheese and how bad is fried cheese for you? ""Really bad Ashley"" says my inner organic-food-voice. BUT I don't care. I love fried cheese dipped in marinara sauce! 

Plus the manager here was very nice and offered us two free drinks since I couldn't use my coupon and she was willing to write on my coupon so I could use it at a later date. However, my coupon was not on the verge of expiring so I just said I would come back later.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,4,rhdb_TqsDw-yi8nf9suiSw
4911044,2015-10-16,1,okSpbU86tbKULQtz3vT-Bw,"Stephanie started us off with 5 star service. Smiling, funny, efficiently correcting our order when we changed our minds. Ok, I changed mine. She went with the flow and didn't have any issues using the register as so many do.

They got knocked down a star because the tables were dirty and they were out of napkins.

They got knocked down another star because we waited for what seemed like forever. We were on our way to an event and figured that 30 minutes would be plenty of time to get our fast food and get to the venue up the road. After 20 minutes, I sent my husband up to the counter to find out if they had forgotten us. We didn't even get our drinks. They told us it would be another couple of minutes, and it was. 

While we were eating, they lost all of the rest of their stars and even dipped into the negative as I was embarrassed to hear what I can only assume was the manager publicly berate Stephanie. I wasn't able to hear everything he said, but I heard the poor girl say back that she was the only one up front during the rush. I can contest that she was. I saw a bunch of staff members in the back, but nobody helping her. she even had to go back and drop the fries after ringing us up. Management 101: Do not publicly discipline anyone, ever. It looks bad on you, demotivates the employees, and alienates your customers. I was embarrassed for her and embarrassed for everyone in the restaurant. I wish I could have seen this person so I could report who he was.

They got their two stars back because the food was absolutely delicious. A few tweaks in training and possibly a full staff and they would be a 5 star Arby's - as long as they keep Stephanie.",OueXAik2P-eUcXbd1qGXKw,1,0,2,ond6YCVWBLk11CXBcx_L1Q

I remember back in the day when you got a nice, meat filled sandwich and didn't have to pay extra.  They've changed their menu (quite awhile ago) to have different sizes of sandwiches.  The prices are outrageous, in my opinion.  I mean, this is fast food, it shouldn't cost as much as a trip to Applebees.

Today was my first visit to Arby's in a very long time, and I am sure it will be quite a while before I return.  My Mom wanted to go there so we could get the 2 for $6 reuben sandwiches.  That is a decent deal, because 1 sandwich alone is normally $6.19.  The combo is over $8 - that is crazy to me!

I am not sure why I am giving them 3 stars.  The service is friendly, but horribly slow.  The food always seems hot and fresh.  Today was ridiculous.  We were the 2nd car in line waiting to order, and this took about 15 minutes.  Then it took even longer at the window.  The cashier apologized profusely, saying that they got ""slammed"" in the restaurant and there were only 2 of them working.  He offered us a free drink for the wait.  We declined, but I appreciate the offer.  When he gave us our food, he said he threw in some free cheese sauce for the fries, which was a nice gesture.

I think that there is a reason that you don't see a lot of Arby's like you do other chains.  Their product isn't that great, and extremely overpriced.  Do yourself a favor and make your beef 'n cheddars at home.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,3,8zwCDokj3ScBEoY19S0OQA
