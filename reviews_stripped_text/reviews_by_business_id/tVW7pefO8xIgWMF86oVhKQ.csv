As a chain started by firemen, hot sauce is supposedly a running theme here. Over on the side is a case of various hot sauces from around the world. Some of the hot sauces are delicious, some are off putting, but I really don't know that the hot sauce adds anything to their sandwiches. To each their own I guess, but it's safe to say you won't be disappointed by Firehouse Subs. 

Be sure to put it into your rotation of places like Subway or Quiznos.",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,3,1,5,YZ0GcyoTw3tQW2vWJRCnGw

Fingers and nose frozen with a/c blowing on me! I couldn't even enjoy my meal.. If I decide to try this again this season, I will update my review. If I were a fireman, maybe I could endure the extreme but I'm not 'har har har'!!!
I'd also concur with some other reviewers to say the place was dirty and there's nothing that pisses me off more than a restroom with no paper towels.

The Sweet and Spicy Meatball sub is absolute heaven. I also tried some sort of chicken sub and substituted the mayo for honey mustard - it was amazing. Yes, we went to this place twice in one weekend. 

There is also a great soda machine here with over 100 flavors to choose from. If you like your food on the spicier side, there are a number of hot sauces at the end of the counter that are rated 1-10+++ on the hotness scale. 

The establishment itself is very clean, and very much like one would imagine a firehouse back in the day (minus one of those awesome poles). The staff were all very friendly and seemed really amused at how excited I was about their food. 

If I could, I would eat there all the time. Firehouse Subs, please make your way down to Southern CA!",yem8gI-CHU_N0m97T_rLFg,0,1,5,gkf4B8aLbfeP5sxJnzqWqg

I had no where else to be. They're done on time, I'll give them that. But as soon I get home and give them to my family, I see that they didn't even make them right. I ordered a Hero with no ham. They put extra ham. It says ""No Ham"" on the receipt. I ordered 2 of the Cheddar Briskets with no mayo. The one has mayo, and they forgot the cheddar and bbq sauce on the other. Really? Seriously? I paid $10 a piece for those damn sandwiches. I drove out of my way to get them. It already took way too long for those girls to make them and they do it wrong. I hope they lose their jobs. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. They're probably the same age as me, early college years. I know exactly what it's like to work in food and customer service.

I was very frustrated at the time, because I explained to them that I have been asked before if I would like my sandwich toasted. The owner's wife mention that none of her cashiers would ask that question. So as customer in my opinion the owner's wife did not think maybe it has happen or maybe this customer has had other orders with the purchases before or this is not a first time customer of our store to notice who is the owner. I enjoy the tuna from Firehouse Subs, but I will never frequent that store again, and will let co workers also know about the experience.

This location also seems to have a morale problem. During my visit, I noticed the manager chastising the cashiers about who knows what. Suddenly, everyone behind the counter had a tense and sad look on their face as if this kind of treatment happens often. They are walking on eggshells back there.

They use the type of stringy lettuce that should only be used as a bed for your real food. At least subway has spinach. The meat was bland and I was looking at SO MUCH CHEESE and for some reason still couldn't taste it.

I coupled it with a wonderful combo drink from their nifty beverage machine mentioned by other reviewers, namely 3/4 minute-maid lemonade with 1/4 Minute-maid strawberry lemonade a squeeze of fresh lime and now I am even happier.

2223037,2011-12-12,2,tVW7pefO8xIgWMF86oVhKQ,"Despite all of the sandwich chains here in the southwest (Subway, Quiznos, Jimmy John's, Port of Subs, Eddie's...), it's hard to get a hot vegetarian sub without negotiations beyond what I'm usually looking for in a fast food experience. 

(Exceptions: Quiznos and Capriottis, who both have hot veg fare on the menu. However, the local Quiznos always gets my order wrong and the local Capriottis always has some bizarre problem where they can't make my order at all, or when they do it's a 20-minute wait, so I've disqualified both by never bothering to go there again after the first half-dozen disappointments.)

Tonight I walked into the very clean, very bright, VERY friendly Firehouse Subs and ordered the hot veggie sub straight off the menu. Melted provolone? Caramelized *and* sliced onions? Mushrooms? Peppers? Glory!

If I'd wanted to tweak my toppings around a bit, I'm sure I could've; my husband changed the cheese on his steak sandwich without any fuss. The woman taking the order was happy to accommodate him.

My sandwich was delicious and my husband, the guy who makes sad noises in the car when I suggest a sandwich place for dinner, only stopped chewing long enough to sing praises. 

Throw in one of those way-cool Coke Freestyle machines (120 flavor combinations!) and this establishment sits above the bar that others strain to reach. I mixed up a slightly misguided Sprite trinity: vanilla, raspberry, cherry. (The vanilla was the surprising highlight of the concoction.)

Suggestions to get this from 4ish to 5 stars:

The bread is decent but unremarkable. I'd like to have some options with cheese or sesame seeds, not just ""white or wheat?""

Tiny sample cups for the Coke Freestyle machine for a small surcharge. Otherwise, people will stand there trying their mix, adding to it, trying it again, which could become a health as well as a queue concern.

If you offer me a pickle, don't forget to include my pickle. My mouth was all set for a pickle. :(

The only cheese on the menu seems to be provolone, but in fact Firehouse Subs offers cheddar, Monterey Jack, and Swiss. This needs to be advertised somewhere.

Because Sonic's cherry limeade is certainly known around these parts, the cherry limeade at Firehouse should include some sort of notice on its poster (next to the Coke machine that dispenses it) that it's a ""flat"" drink, not carbonated. Poor hubs made a sad face.

It's not the best sandwich in Las Vegas, no, but if it's after 5 p.m. (when Baguette Cafe closes) and I don't want to drive far or stay long, Firehouse Subs has earned a spot on my shortlist.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,2,2,4,LxKPA8DkYyYv4Ebf6cXCgg

There was ice all over the floor near the soda machine - pretty sure that was an accident waiting to happen. So, three stars to this location, not the food chain in general.

If you receive coupons in the mail, make sure to check for ones for this place. My GF and I got two meals (small sandwich, drink, chips) for $4.58 LOL. You can use multiple coupons on one order, which is very rare.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,5,2,3,7WNzg5CArKorx6hY4sm0Tw

I don't care to have any real conversation with the person ringing me up or making my sandwich but when you are trying to be a better alternative than Subway, Port of Subs, Quiznos, try to at least fake that you want to be there. 

I liked that they have a big selection of different hot sauces. That was a plus, too bad I had to add plenty to make my sandwich have more flavor. I don't drink soda all that often but they have one of those build your own coke machines and that is also a nice addition to Firehouse Subs.

They apparently just raised their pricing, but for still about $10 you can get a regular size sandwich, a medium fountain drink, and a bag of chips.

I have been to a few other locations, but I am ranking this one because I was impressed that when I went here, 2 days in a row, the young lady, Audra, working the register remembered me and my name from the day before.  She also offered me a punch card so I can get a free meal after I get 10 punches.

The other staff in the dining room are friendly when they deliver my order and I like the Coca Cola machine that has all the different sodas...I am a big Dr. Pepper fan so I am glad they offer that.  There is also a TV in the dining room so you can watch that while you dine and enjoy your meal.

I do enjoy Firehouse Subs and their product. The only reason I don't enjoy it more is because I have to pass Subway (that part is actually pretty easy :P), Port of Subs, Capriotti's, and Jimmy John's to get there!

(+) They have those awesome Coke machines where you can mix sodas and flavors! That is always a big plus for me! Cherry Coke Zero!!
(+) Subs are always tasty! I keep trying new menu items and, while I prefer some over others, I have yet to get a total stinker.


(-)  little bit on the pricey side. my last footlong was $13. Footlong sub at Port of Subs is $8.50
(-) the few times I have been here it has been busy and the place has been pretty trashed. Maybe I can update it next time I go during a slower time.

Service seems to be hit or miss. I have gotten great service at times and meh service at other times. Feels like a crapshoot in that regard.

Overall, this place is a-ok. I will eventually be back and try something else...if I can make it past those 4 other sub places between my house and Firehouse!

Candace took our order, whom was very nice and attentive to our needs. She was so nice, it caught me off guard because I'm used to crappy service everywhere we go. 

We're from New England originally, I'd been CRAVING a ""hot oven grinder"" for 2 years. I got an Italian sandwich it comes with Genoa salami, pepperoni, ham, melted provolone, Italian dressing & seasoning, onions, tomato lettuce, and mustard.

Back east it's pretty much the same way but WITHOUT mustard & they usually throw hot peppers on it. I wasn't heart broken I never liked hot peppers on my sandwich. 

I got an 8"" italian sub without mustard or onions on it. It bought me back home for brief moment. For $5.79 I couldn't be happier, I was shocked the prices were REASONABLE.  I HATE subway with a passion now that I've come here. It was just THAT much better. The combo is 2.29 more with a medium drink & chips. 

Now for desert they had COOKIES. =) Oh yeah, I'm going there. I had a Chocolate chip cookie, my boyfriend had Oatmeal Raisin. Both of them were soft,  chewable and delicious. They're $0.85 for cookies & and they had brownies are $1.29.

The place steams the meats and I gotta say I never thought it'd be so freakin' delicious. I'm in love with this place. We'll be back.

I forgot to mention the whole reason we came I saw a picture of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine that my boyfriend is thoroughly in love with. I told him they had it, he didn't even give me a chance to look at the menu, he said ""LET'S GO!"". Every time we get drinks from a free style machine we do half SPRITE vanilla & half Sprite Strawberry.

I've tried a couple different subs but my personal favorite is the Hook and Ladder. Sweet honey ham and turkey. They have a wheat bread option and I like it 'fully involved.' If you don't like the regular chips they also have brownies and cookies with no up charge. 

As part of their charity they sell pickle buckets for $2. Just a side note that's cheaper than a Home Depot bucket.

This reminds me of a higher end port of subs or subway. They have the same concept and same sort of fixings. The difference between those and this, the hot sauces. They have a ton of different hot sauces for your dipping, smearing, glopping pleasure :)

The design inside is to look like a firehouse.... Saw that comin! They do have a few TV's there, but barely any volume so it doesn't compete with the noise from the patrons eating. When you order ""for here"" you take a number and they bring it to your table... That's kind of nice :) 

For a small drink and a ""fuel under 500"" Aka small light sandwich... The total came to $8.31. Food is all fresh and the staff is super nice. I had no idea what or how to order and I had about 10 people behind me. So I told the gal what I was looking for and she gave me options. Quick and easy!

When I walked in, every employee looked up and welcomed me. I let the cashier know I had never been into a Firehouse, and she quickly went over the menu options and let me know that Firehouse steams all of the meats and cheese unless requested. There are two sizes available, 8"" and 12"".

I had the 8"" Turkey Bacon Ranch, no onion, and steamed of course! My sandwich was ready to take back to work about 5 minutes later, and it came with a dill pickle on the side. The sub was slightly messy due to the peppercorn ranch dressing, but not too messy.. Next time I may ask them to go easy on the dressing. The ingredients were really flavorful, you can tell the meats used are of better quality then some other sandwich shops around town. 

I will definitely be back to try some of the other subs in the future.

4414512,2016-01-26,0,tVW7pefO8xIgWMF86oVhKQ,Was craving a meatball sandwich! For like weeks. And once I saw my friend eat one so I was like I must have. I finally came here on my lunch break they don't open till ten so I had to stall for thirty mins but I already knew that from googling them. The cashier was friendly and funny. I ordered and the sandwich maker said my name right (saying my name right gets you extra points) lol I was worried about the integrity of the sandwich so I rushed back to work. I found it wasn't wrapped like other sandwiches but in a sun styrofoam box. Which is cool. Sandwich wasn't all soggy and what not by the time I bit into it. Needless to say I inhaled that sandwich. Despite the fact that the meatballs were still steaming and the top of my mouth is now tingling. It was amazing. And I'm pretty picky when it comes to fresh bread and good red sauce. My whole office said it smelt bomb. Which is something I am selfconcoous about when it comes to lunches. (I'd hate to be the weirdo who stinks up the office with weird smelling food) I could have taken more cheese but I'm also a cheese-a-holic! So I'm sure it was just right for the average person.,V26EHxCEXhJ0Ziv3GR-Vkg,0,0,5,xY4xVv1utQowYEFERvcDEg

However, I've moved from Boca Park area in Summerlin so the closest FS was at Flamingo & 215- they're awesome!
But now I tried the 6070 S Rainbow/Patrick
location & although they were super nice - the floor was riddled with spilled soda along with A LOT of trash & they were NOT busy..
I called ahead for 2 large Italian subs with dressing on the side. After dodging the obstacle course of crap, I paid & verified with the cashier the dressing was on side & she assured me it was but she didn't check & by the time I was about to pull out of the lot, the nagging sensation that she could be wrong got to me so I opened the bag & Surprise! No Dressing! I know-BIG shocker!
Also the receipt in the bag was for someone else's order! So I go back inside, walked past the trash for a 3rd time & they were very apologetic but we soon realized the bag was indeed someone else's order...
Got home & was further disappointed by dressing already on the sandwiches & soggy ass bread  we ate a few bites but ultimately paid $20 for inedible food & Had to throw both subs away... Not sure what the deal is with them but just from the lil but we ate, both my fiancé & I were quite ill...
I'll spare u the gory details but I will say we're glad We stopped eating when We did!
Seriously doubt I'll be craving FS for a while! It could've been a fluke but idk for sure..
All I know is it's almost 1:30am & we ate at 4pm but yet my tummy is STILL sounding like an alien wants to pop out!

Firehouse won this weekend, and I am SO glad that it did!

We've been wanting to try Firehouse for ages, but always seem to forget that its around.  

The restaurant was clean, and the service was super polite. 

They don't have a huge menu, but all of the sandwiches looked great.  I decided to try The Engineer, which is turkey breast, mushrooms, and swiss cheese.  I ordered it ""Fully Involved"" (mayo, lettuce, mustard, onion, pickle, hold the tomato on mine please!)

Fella had the New York Steamer with corned beef, brisket, Pastrami, mustard and dressing, with veggies added. 

They have a hot sauce bar, where you can take little to go containers of hot sauce home with  you.  

The drink machine is bad-ass, too, with a TON of different options, including cherry vanilla coke!

5361297,2012-11-20,0,tVW7pefO8xIgWMF86oVhKQ,"**Summary**
      - Hot subs - Their hot subs are hot from the inside out. From their heated meats to the melting cheese, they're simply delicious.
      - Drink Machine - They have one of those drink machines that let you mix sodas and flavor shots. It's quite novel if you haven't seen one before.
**Ordered**
      - Hook & Ladder - Turkey, ham, and cheese. This hot sandwich is definitely my favorite. It has the right combination of salty meats and melty cheese.
      - Firehouse Meatball - This is definitley one of the best meatball subs I've had.
      - Engineer - Turkey, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms. Unfortunately, the mushrooms are out of a can and ruined the taste of the sandwich for me.
**Recommendations**

Those would definitely be the 2 sandwiches Id suggest to anyone that comes here. Yes they're a little bit more pricier by a few dollars compared to other sandwich places but the quality/taste makes it worth it. They also have those modern coke machines that lets you choose what ever soft drink you prefer which is a plus. They have a low cal menu option too. They don't work off of or accept tips.

Their menu is anything but extensive. They have about 10 different sandwich options, but they all sounded pretty good so we were quick to order. I got the Engineer which was great with the addition of mushrooms. Considering the prices, you get a huge footlong sandwich for the price. 

On top of that, the soda dispenser is amazing. So many different varieties and mixtures to choose from. You can get pretty much any soda you can think of and you have the option of adding flavoring as well. It took me forever to pick my poison.

Service was good, the location is enormous and is clean, which is important. 

When I got my food home, I was a little turned off by how soggy the sandwich was. I'm not a fan of soggy bread typically. My fella's wheat bread definitely held up better than the white I ordered, so I'll probably order wheat next time. Despite the soggy texture, the flavors were fantastic. A little bit too much meat for my taste, but I think I'm a bit odd in the respect of preferring my sandwich not as meaty. The sandwich was melty and extremely tasty.

I'll definitely be back. So happy to have a good sandwich option near home, since I don't like Quizno's, Port of Subs or Capriotti's.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,4,sugofJg092U8ZHubX8UpAA
