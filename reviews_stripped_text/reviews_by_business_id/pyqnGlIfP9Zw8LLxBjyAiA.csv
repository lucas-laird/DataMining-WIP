2685,2013-02-16,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Lucky Las Vegas!! Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!  

First, a few fun facts:
- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 
- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! 
- The NOBU Hotel, a ""boutique hotel"" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first ""NOBU Hotel"" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  

Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.

Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!

1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)
six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking ""should I order another round now or later?"" as they are finishing off this one ;) 

2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)
So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't ""pass"" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) 

3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)
This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, ""las vegas"", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their ""own"" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! 

4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)
OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. 

5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16
This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... 

6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14
If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!

Dessert
We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15
Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. 

I'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!",1oCH03guW5bqwvLrCEuVwQ,20,11,5,sBcq7cMTRWzivpuVaGgIOA

They sat us at this square table in the back with no atmosphere.  Service was super slow and our server was nowhere to be found most of the time.

$12 for fresh wasabi and was given a watery paste!  I know what fresh wasabi is and that is why I am willing to pay.    

Waiters are arrogant not confident.   When asked about a dish they just rant off the menu as is I can't read.

Long story short, if you want good japanese go to kabuto at spring mountain, it is better than a lot of sushi bars in Japan.

1 more to avoid would be Masa at Aria, they served my frozen tilapia when I ordered Tai (pink snapper).",l_IXLemetaT9edO20vo0TA,4,0,1,PxMtK0ryDnyOzuKtMIL9iw

My first impression was not great however, as they lost my reservation, that is never good when you are starving and ready for a good meal. However, they did move quickly to rectify the situation and found us a decent table in the bar. 

Now, I have been fortunate to partake of some amazing sushi from NY to LA, and for these prices, that is what I was expecting.  Unfortunately, they did not deliver. It was good, it just wasn't fantastic, and for these prices, fantastic is what I would expect. 

The service was also just good. Little mistakes here and there that should not happen at a reastraunt of That caliber. 

Overall, just not what I would expect when I'm shelling out close to $500 for myself and two friends. I'm afraid that in the end, Nobu just came off as pretentious.",hyH7JP_UcXJLuHG3D6BPmg,2,0,2,6NJLp4-JWMD-mXz9P4ZgzA

The miso cod was just ok, a little salty and they left a piece of skin on it that made it a bit fishy.

I went and dropped 2 bills and leave still hungry is disappointing which I know is typical at some fine dining places but for that price I could have ate at Mastros or another place where the potions are larger. As far as the food I ate a steak with onions as truffle sauce and it was excellent. This place is for the experience not to get full. If you want to leave full expect to at least pay 300. I would a have gave it a higher rating but I wasn't blown away by the taste and I didn't leave thinking it's expensive but worth it.,PdvBIY7QKQB1t0xtk7JKYw,0,0,3,AqMSWD1PFYlZO70VGQrfsg

91926,2015-07-10,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"This was initially a 2* but, having been in the service industry for so long, I can take our experience with a grain of salt. To sum it up: the food was excellent and over-priced - just as we expected and were ready for, but the emphasis should be on excellent because it truly was worth it. The service, however, was pretentious, inaccurate, but most of all - excruciatingly slow. Our server, a gentleman with an Italian name that I had to ask for because he offered no information to us outside of his overbearing spiels, simply did not care that much. I could throw out guesses as to why he was the way he was - most likely our group didn't seem like it would be particularly lucrative for him (we were all bartenders/servers so he assumed wrong) - but that is conjecture. Getting in our order was a painful 30 minute process. Getting a refill of our alcoholic beverages (a tap beer and a whiskey on the rocks) took 15-20 minutes (it was not busy). And in the end just getting our damn bill took a good 20 minutes. I might go back but I would make sure he is not my server. Also, dude, that whiskey isn't made from actual coffee - it's made in Coffey stills.",uJzQ3ee1eeF15Vr4GSTc6A,0,0,3,s0H3aRjNj74WiAJULvSn9g

181464,2014-12-22,3,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I should preface this review by saying that I am a vegetarian and do not eat seafood. I asked our waiter what vegetarian options they had, and he suggested the tofu toban yaki and vegetables for $30. I asked if there were any off menu items, and the chef told him there was a tofu with cantaloupe salad also for $30. I ordered the latter, and there must have been some miscommunication because it ended up being so small, I wouldn't even call it an appetizer. I'm surprised they both cost $30 for such vastly different amounts of food. I promptly called our waiter over, and he willingly switched my entree for the tofu toban yaki and vegetable stir fry. This ended up being cooked in flamed sake, and it had a rich sake flavor, which I think was pretty unique. However, I'm kind of disappointed and feel ripped off that I essentially paid $30 for tofu and vegetable stir fry that didn't even include unique vegetables. Ultimately, it kind of sucked that my girlfriend and I weren't able to eat at the same time.

My girlfriend ordered their black cod, one of their signature dishes, which she loved. This was a large piece of fish cooked well and included their miso sauce. 

I personally would not go back nor recommend this place to somebody who doesn't eat seafood. If you eat seafood, you'll probably like the food, but be prepared to pay out the wazoo.",CTVxRmgEf9HJqdI7v21QWw,3,2,3,SdAzF52fkA4Ot-iHw53_Pg

Now the average - the food and portions. Except for the black cod, which was excellent, everything else was very average. The portions were downright silly. I don't know if you can slice a yellowtail thinner than they did and if they did, it would be an empty plate.

Now the worst - the prices, considering the above. We paid nearly $500 for 4 people. That includes a $60 bottle of Sake (I could be off on that price but that is what I recall). If the food was fabulous, $100 per person I can handle considering it is Vegas. But with average food and terrible portions, no way.

On my recent trip to vegas with my mom, we visited the nobu at caesar's palace.
The waiter was accommodating when I said we would probably want to order just a few sushi rolls. He didn't pressure us at all to order more.
We ended up starting with the shrimp tempura, which was very good. But had I known how great the sushi rolls were, we would have skipped the tempura - or gotten tempura rolls. Btw, not typical tempura, as there is not traditional panko breading. The shrimp is fried, but doesn't seem breaded at all.

It's the same damn dish served by 50%+ of the other japanese restaurants out there, except it's $10 more expensive!  The quality of the food isn't bad, but it sure isn't on par with a Sasabune or Sushi-Zo. And there's nothing innovative about the menu at all that you cant get from most other japanese restaurants, so quality is really a big weighing factor here!

I get that there's a certain premium that you're expected to pay to dine at a prime location in Caesars, but they are literally bending you over the table, pulling down your pants, and....well, you get the idea.

The service was pretty good, so if you are looking to have dinner in a nice, upscale restaurant, and don't mind paying exorbitantly for decent food, then by all means this would be a respectable choice. But just know that you can very easily take a cab 10 min off the strip to any number of japanese restaurants that serve same or higher quality dishes at 1/3  ~ 1/2 of the cost.

We had snapper ($34 for six very thin slices in a sour sauce) and yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño ($24). The fish was fresh, but not that special.  We also had the uni shooter ($16) and oyster shooter ($12).  They are both pretty good. My husband liked the oyster more.  For hot dishes, we had their famous black cod with miso ($30). We didn't really like it, the sauce was too sweet for us. Then we had the scallops with wasabi pepper ($36). The scallops were too dry and really spicy. We couldn't eat it so the waiter offered to take it back. The waiter asked if we like tempura. We said we like it ok. He suggested king crab tempura.

It's the tobanyaki beef. It was good and the beef was tender. I think we liked this the best. It was ($44).  So overall, our experience was quite disappointing. We didn't mind paying $$$$ since we knew that it's a pricey place. But the food and the service were not a good experience.  If you really want to give it a try, purchase a groupon.

Nobu is deserving of the ""$$$$"" as is listed.  Expect to spend a decent amount of cash.  I am only disappointed with price when the service or food does not match.

I've had sushi around the world, from Hong Kong to LA to Tsukiji in Tokyo, and while I didn't expect to have the best sushi of my life in Las Veags, I certainly didn't expect to have the WORST. 

The visual presentation of the courses was cute, but that's about it--the sashimi was bland, the soup broth was burnt, and the oysters were mediocre at best.

We politely filed out complaints with the manager, who received our comments with condescension and refused to even apologize or attempt to offer anything that might have redeemed the night.

My boyfriend and I have always wanted to try nobu everytime we were in Vegas but never got the chance. This week we were in Vegas and decided it would be the perfect time to try it. 

Service: I really enjoyed the service here. We told our server it was our first time and she did a great good at explaining the menu. She kept it simple and really knew what she was talking about. She helped us named out some popular dishes but never forced anything on us. We decided to order a little bit of everything instead of the omakase. They also had helpers that were always constantly refilling our water and cleaning our table after every dish.

Decor: the decor inside was very modern. They kept it dark, which was a little bit too dark for me but I didn't mind it too much. 

Food: The food here was absolutely amazing! Before we ate here my boyfriend and I were talking about how we don't think chefs were able to make sushi taste that different to charge the prices that they do. But as soon as we took a bite into the yellowtail jalapeño appetizer, it was delicious! The flavors were so well put together and had a great balance. I was in love with their new style scallops and salmon sashimi. Chef Nobu really nailed it. We also tried his signature Cod dish which was also amazing. I appreciate how they serve their cold food then Hot after, it really did make a big difference and we enjoyed our meal.

For two people we got to tried a little bit of everything and some of his best dishes. Our total was about $200, which I didn't think was that bad  for how amazing the food was. After dining here, it definitely changed my view on how to eat sushi. I would love to come back here again one day. Amazing job",fZXtfXukHUP54qLS7zc9Cw,3,0,5,VKIqLlzsIwPyCenYloX2FQ
473582,2013-02-27,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I am writing this review based on the restaurant side only and not the teppenyaki side.  

I went to this new Nobu on 2/13 and it was packed from walk-ins and pre-Valentine dates.  I called ahead to make reservations for 8 p.m. as that was the earliest you could make a reservation on that particular day due to a function.  The hostess on the phone was not very friendly and very rude, and I knew who she was as soon as I arrived.  The hostess desk was very unorganized and they had no clue as to what they were doing.  But this is the strip, people do not care what you think because they know they will get business no matter what and most people are from out of town and will not ever be back anyways.  The manager, who I quickly recognized from the Nobu in the Hard Rock needs to help them instead of stand around like I saw her do the whole night.  Anyways, that was really my only gripe about this place,  and I do not see this particular location getting another Michelin star anytime soon.  They cannot say the new servers and staff do not know what they are doing because they all came from the old Nobu.  Get it together. (Front desk, management).  

As for the best part.  The sushi is still amazing here as well as all of their hot dishes.  Like most people that do not know anything about sushi, you will most likely get the Yellowtail Jalepeno sashimi dish because you heard it was good.....IT IS AMAZING, only 6 pieces but worth the $$$.  I have been to Nobu many times at different locations and I would highly a few of these dishes:

Yellowtail Jalepeno Sashimi
Tuna Tataki
Any of the New Style Tiradito dishes
100% get the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Sauce, you won't regret it.
If your down for spending to impress get the O Toro
Black Cod Miso
Beware, shrimp tempura is only two pieces 8$
Get the Hamachi Kama for sure
Most of these dishes are small, so if they don't fill you up get the beef of tenderloin
But remember this is a Japanese restaurant not a steak house.
And to top it off get the Bento Box for dessert!

If you haven't spent at least 100-120 per person you did not do Nobu right.  This place is no Jiro sushi and definitely better than Yellowtail in the Bellagio, which is a cheap ripoff of Nobu, but definitely the best Japanese restaurant you will find in the United States hands down.

Good:
·  Quality sushi and special bites
·  Decent ambiance

Not so Good:
·  Major push to upsell you on items
·  Saki bottles are marked up 7 times- look them up for yourself

The most impressive part of the meal was probably the carpaccio type cold plates that made up the front part of the meal. Very interesting pairings of sashimi with citrus and chilies. Probably the best was the yellowtail with a paper-thin shaving of jalapeno and dressed with cilantro and yuzu ponzu. The warm preparations were also very good, but I was unimpressed with the ""signature"" black cod in miso glaze -- perfectly executed but quite simple and similar to many dishes I have had in Japan at far lower prices. 

At $200 for dinner I would have been happy; at $300 it's just overpriced. Further, charging $10 a bottle for water (no complimentary water offered) is an insult to customers. Nobu is lucky he can cook.",yiIE43J2xV-z4C-C8JdOUg,1,0,4,x4-DiszmyHI1_wgxkZT7ew

The black cod miso was delicious but the kitchen needs to do a better job at removing the bones - way too many left in - chef Nobu would be ashamed.  The sea bass with dry miso was just as delicious as the black cod.  The service was ok, but way below what I would have expected from a restaurant of this caliber.  The reception desk was well staffed but two of the three girls were clueless. the waitress was pleasant enough but didn't seem to be concerned at all about the amount of bones in the cod and I'm sure did not bring it to the kitchens attention.  the manager/assistant manager Annie should be fired - when an issue was brought to her attention she seemed receptive but all she did was hang out on at the sushi bar and never came back to follow up with us - a bigger slap was when she was straightening up chairs at the table across from us she deliberately avoided us and ran back to the sushi bar.

I have been to this location about 30 times in the last few years. We have always ordered the same thing: 10 tacos each then share rice and plain seabass. I am now completely following my Celiac diet which changed up my last time to Nobu significantly.

I'd have to say this was one of my favorite meals of all time.  We have now moved into the bar area, in a nest, instead of in the main dining room, which I hate. The decorations look like something cheap from Zurchers, and the booths make it feel like you're sitting in a cafeteria.

Anyway. This time, in a nest, in the bar area, we had Johnathan. This guy was FANTASTIC! I told him my new diet and he hooked me up with the best food ever. He had me try the New Style with Scallops with gluten free sauce. It was so amazing I refused to even share with the boyfriend. I made him eat his own tacos. Then I had the seabass, as it is prepared there with the sweeter sauce. Also amazing. Then... my favorite with the black cod miso prepared gluten free in lettuce cups. Those pieces just melted in my mouth. I wanted to go back the second night, but went to Jardin instead (huge mistake, that was horrific). 

I really wish this location would get a better wine menu. That is a huge complaint of mine. It's worse than some of the restaurants in Utah- and they have the worse wine lists. I honestly don't like any of the Chardonnay, but I did get the Pouilly Fuisse and that was actually the perfect pairing.

There was so much to choose from, we ended up trying the Omakase multi-course dinner with flights of sake and whiskey as we thought this would be the best way to experience the chef's signature dishes. 

Our meal started with cold appetizers which included chef's sushi and sashimi assortments. The Whitefish with Yuzu sauce just melts in your mouth while the crunchy sea grapes offers a different textural experience. The salmon carpaccio Salad with Lettuce Handroll was refreshing and crispy. The Chef's Sushi Assortment and Chef's Sashimi Assortment were decadently amazing. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, toro, Salmon Tartare with Caviar, Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar. Yum! The pickled peach that accompanied the appetizers was delicious.

Our hot entrees included their signature Black Cod Miso, which was succulent and both sweet and savory. The Beef Toban Yaki was tender and nicely paired with mushrooms and caramelized onions. I liked this much better than the NY bone-in steak we had for dinner the prior night at Bouchon. While the tofu was delicious, the miso soup was a little salty for me. I actually couldn't finish it after a couple sips. 

We finished dinner with the bento box dessert which included a sinfully rich flourless Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Sauce, Shiso Syrup & Green Tea Ice Cream.

Now, I thought about just writing that above, but 'cmon you know that's not my style.  I believe in a previous review, I raved about Nobu and it wasn't even Nobu's review.  If you don't know what Nobu is, please move on.  It is culinary heaven.  If you don't know by now you probably never will.   I have eaten at a Nobu 4 times now.   Twice in Vegas, and twice in Los Angeles.   Chef Nobu and Mr. Deniro have got this bad boy down!   I have eaten sushi in Japan and it didn't even taste like this.   So here's the deal, I took a bunch of co-workers here.  Telling them it will be the dining experience of their lifetime.  Some were skeptical.   When the waiter said, has anyone dined with us before and I'm the only one that raised my hand, he knew that I knew that he knew it was about to be on!  

So I jokingly said, sir, please keep it under $500 a person.  He said, well if you have eaten here then you know I could make it $1,000 person easily and you will still be hungry wanting more!   I was like yeah, I know....for that smart comment, keep it under $250.  :)  

And he did.  However we left and the bill was just shy of $2K for 5 people.   I don't even need to get into what we had.  It was an assortment of 6 different courses that included sashimi, sushi, wagu beef, and then a desert of shaved ice with a hidden treasure in the bottom.

I was unaware of the EXTREMELY small portion sizes for each dish and that you are meant to get at least 2 to 3 items off of each section of the menu. I glanced at the prices to get an idea of what I was in for before making reservations. That being said, I am aware that does not reflect on the quality or the dining experience. The food itself was good (I highly recommend the tuna tataki). However, you get next to nothing for the price. What you do get however, is a very loud atmosphere (think open walls so that the noise of the casino spills over into the quiet, dimly lit setting of the restaurant), and service leading much to be desired. When we informed our server (who looked distracted and slightly as if we were bothering him the whole time, not cracking so much as a smile once) that this was our 1st time, he spent all of 15 seconds explaining the very complicated menu. He also became even less interested in us when we only ordered about $200 worth of food, when he clearly would have like for us to order $250 per person. To his credit, our waters stayed filled and the food came very quickly. But the noise meant we could barely talk, despite the romantic setting. We ended up ordering 2 items from the cold menu (tuna tataki and 2 bite size salmon tacos), 1 from the hot (creamy spicy rock shrimp that was just a step up from bar food), and 2 sushi rolls (very soft rice but overall forgettable), spent almost $200 and ended up getting burgers afterwards because we were so hungry ,which is just crazy.

I dont mind paying a high price if its worth it... But... We ordered omakase... 2 of them.. Our bill was $300... One of our courses was miso soup..really?... We just dropped 300 bucks and you guys are serving us soup? Severely disappointing when the soup came toward the end. The sushi course with a few different pieces of fish didn't taste quite right... which is why i asked for soy sauce... But everyone insisted i taste the fish and it would be overpowering... The salmon course and cod were wonderful but not worth that price tag.

The Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna is a must have - it's the ultimate umami dish. Hot crispy sticky rice cubes, salty sweet dipping sauce and a creamy cold tuna spread create a one of a kind flavor that melts your palate - it's seriously such a one of a kind flavor meld that you'll remember the first time you had it.  And  you'll want to get it again and again.

Black cod miso is Nobu's signature dish, it's so delicate and tender it's like butter, the miso glaze is sweet (but not too sweet) and the fish will literally melt in your mouth.  It's delicious with hot rice.

The Wagyu gyoza takes potstickers to new heights - the beef is tender, delicious and the scallions and shoyu take this common appetizer to first class.  The wonton wrapper isn't too thick (thick wrappers are a no no in my book) and they're steamed to perfection.

Scallops with spicy garlic was flavorful with pattypan squash, asparagus, and big fat scallops grilled and cooked perfectly.

The only miss was the creamy spicy crab - yikes, this should come off the menu.  The creamy spicy sauce was cloying and completely smothered the crab, it was buried under it. The crab was tough and not appealing.  The waiter noticed we didn't have much of it, asked if we liked it, we said no, he removed it from the bill.

Yellowtail jalapeño, rock shrimp tempura, and toro are also great.  Skip the tacos - they're overpriced and not that interesting.

Service is swift and attentive without being intrusive.  We never had to ask for refills and our used plates were quickly replaced with clean ones (which is great when you're having small plate dishes and mixing the flavors on a single plate doesn't always taste great).

I almost had a heart attack when I opened the menu. Prices ranged from $5 for one piece of sushi all the way to $600 for a 12 oz. steak. Being at the Teppanyaki table, the best experience is to order from the teppanyaki menus which (excuse my lack of fancy vocab) was kind of like a 6 course meal. Everyone in the party ordered the same food course thing.

After a few minutes our chef, Nick, came over and introduced himself. Before cooking he asked if we wanted to see a ""quick show"". In just a few seconds he had his cooking utensils flying everywhere and spinning in a rhythmic, stylish manner. The tricks didn't  stop there; even while preparing the food, he would throw eggs in the air catching and breaking them with one swing of his spatula. I've seen magicians who aren't even as quick as this guy was. 

Aside from the incredible sleight of hand, Nick was very fun to talk with and the whole atmosphere felt much more alive than just a chef cooking food. He told jokes and interesting stories. I would give Nobu 5 stars just for Mick's performance. 

The food itself was outstanding. Being used to eating cheap and on a budget, this dinner blew my mind. The steaks were so tender that you could cut them with chopsticks (which are the main eating utensils). Everything was so well prepared and delicious (plus you get to see it made right in front of you).

Here's what we ordered:
-Salmon Tartare with Caviar (It was so fresh and soft. The salmon pieces were also cut much smaller than other tartares, beef and tuna, that I have had before.)
-Yellow tail Jalapeno (My ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE!!! I can eat this day and night. I'm not one to eat a lot of spicy food, but a small slice on top of the fish isn't bad at all.)

That said, my nephew enjoyed it and it was done with a lovely dash of spice and lemon.  The disappointment came with the traditional sushi rolls.  Do not bother.  Flavors were not balanced and they were completely uninspired. My vegetarian sister had the roasted vegetable plate and it was lovely if exceedingly simple.  I am an Uni fan (sea urchin) and use it to assess the quality of the seafood in most sushi restaurants.  Their Uni was wonderful, delicate and creamy (and also $10 for one).  Sometimes simplicity is all the fresh ingredients need. All in all, I would go back for the cod, and maybe try a new dish to see if I could find another favorite.  Yes, it is pricey, but most of the restaurants in Vegas are.  The service was professional and sufficiently attentive.",6SRlFyZusUxmX0yMeIjRpg,1,1,3,5zyUfJp7-fa9rNgzivGQaw

The whole atmosphere is chic, modern and sophisticated. I was really excited to try another one of Matsuhisa's resturants and Nobu was a great choice for a romantic dinner with cocktails.

If you're looking for something energetic and lively, I would recommend getting reservations. I couldn't get a break in that they only had resrvations at 5:00 PM! go figure. I guess this place is the place to go right now.

However, if you sit by the bar, you'll get these wide spacious booths, very intimate lighting. Comfortable and good for conversation. 


The food, if you've been to any of the other Nobu franchise is pretty much identical. If you're a fan of Uni, the tempura Uni was very fresh, prefectly battered but still sashimi inside! Genious! 

The tobanyaki was also very tender and well marinated, flavored simply but nourishing. All the sushi was cut razor perfect, low grain. High quality of course. 

Only downer was some of the wait staff seemed a bit spacy. Kept asking for water and additonal cocktails, and had to remind them a few times. ( Was not packed in the bar area ,,, soo... what gives?? )

992632,2015-01-05,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"We never even peeked at the menu, since this was our first time, Omakase ($125) was the best way to experience the varied menu. We told our server that we are adventurous diners, we love spicy and we preferred not to have uni since the husband isn't a fan - we left the rest to him. I had a fantastic sauvignon blanc with dinner and the husband really enjoyed the Sake selection. He sampled two excellent chilled varieties: black label and aged.  

Our tasting included many of Nobu's signature dishes. We started with Yellowtail with jalapeno. This is a favorite of ours, it's a must whenever we go for sushi. It certainly did not disappoint. The next dish was Tasmanian Ocean Trout, it was rich and creamy. Very different from the delicate and refreshing yellowtail. The next course was Live Scallop with rocoto paste. It was beautifully presented and it tasted even better than it looked. The scallops melted like butter and the heat from the rocoto pepper awakened our taste buds. We enjoyed  chili so much, we were ready to book a trip to Peru.

Next, we sampled some hot dishes, beginning with the Black Cod Miso. This was delicious. The fish was buttery and the miso gave it the ideal amount of sweetness. I understand why it is one of their most popular dishes. Rock Shrimp with jalapeno followed. Now these were tasty morsels. Shrimp is so often overcooked, but not these. Perfection. And highly addictive. For the next course, the focus was on land rather than sea with the Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki. The scent of this dish was intoxicating. The beef was prepared very well and it was tasty. However, it was our least favorite. 

We wrapped up dinner with a sample of Tuna and Salmon Sushi. Both rolls were simplistic, but incredibly yummy. The rice was beautifully seasoned, key for great sushi. Finally, we finished with a vanilla dessert and a variety of mochi. A lovely end to an exceptional meal.

If you can swing it, the Omakase is an awesome experience. Keeping it simple by choosing a few small plates would be totally worthwhile, too.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,0,5,jS2dZnB-KO_KPfOOMmPAcQ

Jonathan who is just delightful gave us the tasting menu. We ended up closing the menu and trusting what he ordered for us. At first I was a bit cautious since last time I did a tasting, I was still hungry at the 7th course! This one did not disappoint! We were stuffed by the end of the night!

We were very well looked after by Jonathan. I'm so glad I went with the cucumber martini. It was so good that I didn't bother trying any other cocktail and that says a lot! I usually try as many as I can handle. Loved loved loved the cucumber martini that I had 3. They used Belvedere. I hope it was certainly in there since after having 3, I wasn't even buzzed. 

Each dish that came was an amazing surprise. OMG, everything was so so mouth watering amazingly out of this world good. I salivate as I type this.  

It was awesome that every item that was served tasted as if it was caught on the day. It was so so fresh! Oh man, I want some NOW!

Out of all the dishes Jonathan ordered, it was hard to have any favorites. They were all excellent! I mean everything! So enjoy the pics that I posted. I will try not to lick my screen in the meantime. 

Oh, at the end of the night, they will ask if you want dessert. I must've gone to the restroom at this time since we didn't get any. I would've still eaten it, LOL!

This was our first meal in Vegas and it did not disappoint. We couldn't get in until 10:30 but had some appetizers at Gordon Ramsay's next door (also delicious). We didn't really know what to get but the server was very helpful and made suggestions that we ended up going with. 

As mentioned in many reviews, the yellowfin with jalapeño is very good. We also had a king crab ceviche, scallops on chips, and a salmon sashimi dish. One of my friends doesn't really like raw fish and she enjoyed many of the things she tried. In addition to these starters, we also shared a grilled beef dish as well as the signature cod dish. It was good but I wouldn't call it amazing... It has a nice sweet flavour but wasn't anything particularly special. 

For dessert, we got the bento box which has a floury chocolate cake and ice cream on the side. Very good. For drinks, we got sake which is the perfect pairing with these delicate dishes. Wine would have been overpowering and the sake is a great palate cleanser. 

I enjoyed my experience here but I don't think I could justify coming back. It was fun and nice to try a lot of things but it was a bit expensive given the portion sizes.

Everything was so fresh and proof of good quality ingredients being used was obvious when we saw and tasted the food. Also, the portions were surprisingly generous as well!

We didn't have too much for dinner as we were stuffed from previous meals. 

My mom started with their clear mushroom broth (I'm sure it has a much fancier name but that's essentially what it was). As plain as it seemed, she said it had a good balance of flavour in it and obviously did not have any hint of MSG in it. I started with the shrimp tempura. Nothing amazing, expensive for what two pieces but I guess eating at Nobu I shouldn't be surprised.

For our main course, we had to try the signature Miso Black Cod. I can't stress how beautiful a cut they serve. It was BEAUTIFUL. That cut alone wouldn't be cheap if you bought it to make it at home yourself. They cook it so beautifully that all the juices stay in the fish until you cut into it and put it in your mouth. The only thing I was a little sad about was because the cut is so thick, it should've been marinated longer so the entire fish would have been flavoured all the way through. No biggie. The top of the fish was amazing. 

I suggest maybe getting a bowl of rice or having a few other small dishes with it because it's very rich if you try to eat it on its own and finish an order to yourself.

Definitely worth going to try. Beware slow service.",UWokmzyJnFLsKWzRpgY9iw,1,0,5,NYnpHsqivlgObjOokTbRIQ

I actually went to Nobu in NYC probably 7 years ago and I remember it being very good, but didn't recall how very good it is. 

My wife and I went to the Caesars Palace location before a show the other night. Even at 6pm it was filling up quickly, so if you want to go at a more typical Vegas dinner time, make a reservation several days ahead of time. Or do what my wife and I do often, sit at the bar. 

We shared two cold dishes and one hot dish. The yellowtail with jalapeño, and the dry miso snapper for the cold dishes. Both extremely good. The servers do a great job of presenting each dish with instructions on how to best enjoy them. For example, for the yellowtail, the server who brought the dish said ""the chef recommends a little of the cilantro on each slice.""  Take their advice for sure. 

For the hot dish we had their signature miso black cod. Wow. So good!

I really like how the cooks take so much pride in the presentation, and the servers take the time to talk to you about the dish. 

Cade, our bartender, provided great service and he is the one who recommended what we got. He is an excellent bartender. 

Sometimes we have all been disappointed by a place that has so much hype. Not the case here.  Put this one on your bucket list. 

**Update**

Went again last night (9/8/17).  We sat at the bar and Toshih was our bartender. He was awesome. Had the Red Snapper, Miso Cod, Alaskan Crab Tempura, and an off menu Yellowtail special roll that Toshih recommended. All were to die for. I just can't get over how good the dishes are at Nobu. Truly one of the best restaurants in America if not the world.",jhT9r_NBORDB2Fa5mBXWTA,0,0,5,a1IBRyqNrM7pA-48tXpUJg

We had a group of 7 (I think a really great size for this dining experience is 5-7) and did the multi course omakase with the chef's daily creation menu. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. One of our party has dietary restrictions and the waiter was great about understanding just what those limitations were so the party member didn't miss out on any part of the experience. The dishes that stood out the most: the seabass, the lobster, and the yellow tail tuna. OMGosh!  I strongly recommend letting your server and the chef handle selections.

The ambience is beautiful, the servers are polite and nice, and the service is impeccable.

For drinks had the cucumber margarita which was actually one of the healthiest things I've ever had (LOL). The drink has barely ANY alc but it is such a refreshing cucumber purée with a fresh lychee and cucumber slice. Definitely felt more like a relaxing drink at the spa! 

For food had the yellowtail sashimi which had the best ponzu like (with I believe a sake reduction?) sauce and the most delicate jalapeño slides to add a little kick to the smoothness to the yellowtail. Then had the lobster ceviche which was to my surprise, lightly seasoned which I didn't mind. It comes out unlike traditional ceviche and comes out drier with seasoned lobster pieces and onions on top of lettuce wraps. Next had their famous black miso cod and OMG OMG OMG -- moment of silence for this because this dish, both in the way the fish is cooked (perfection) and seasoned is impeccable. The fish is SO tender and soft it literally melts with the miso sauce it is paired with. I can eat this all day everyday. 

Next dish was their shrimp tempura which is lighter and more delicate than traditional tempura pieces which is deep fried to the max. Came with three sauces and loved the jalapeño crime. Then came the SCALLOP skewers (yes I get scallops at every place) and definitely one of the better scallops I've had because it was soft but sturdy enough to capture all the natural flavored and substance of the scallops. Finished off with a small salmon roll!

For dessert, ordered the Japanese hazelnut doughnuts which was more like a lightly fried dough bread with hazelnut spread inside and came with a raspberry sauce and ice cream.

the food was exceptional (except for one dish, details to follow). I highly recommend the Yellowtalk with jalapeño, toro tartare, black cod in miso and the squid ""pasta"", which is not really pasta but a fantastic bowl full of grilled squid and fresh vegetables in an excellent broth. there was a special of tuna carpaccio with truffle and crumbled almonds that was out of this world. a gigantic miss was the monkfish pate which tasted way too fishy and had a sauce that was way too salty. we couldn't even eat half of it, but to the server's credit, she took it off the bill

now, the reason I can't rate this higher...

I have never been afraid to pay excessively high prices when the food, service, reputation and atmosphere dictate it. I have been dining at top restaurants around the world pretty much my entire adult life, including Vegas. here, there is a premium added to the the price of everything and it's expected and part of the experience. however, that's not an excuse for an atmosphere that isn't in line with the food quality and the price.

our waitress was nice and seemed knowledgable about the food, but anytime we asked for a recommendation, she automatically picked the most expensive item in that category. not once or twice, but every time. it was uncomfortably obvious. there was little conversation about what we liked or didn't like so far, she just wanted us to order the most expensive things on the menu. very off-putting. our table for two was very close to the kitchen door and on the outside row next to a corridor where drunk, loud people were passing by. at these prices, a little more attention to the ambiance surrounding each table would have been appreciated.

dinner for two, with one cocktail each and no dessert, was $280 before the tip. I wouldn't say we were stuffed, just comfortable. we could have easily eaten a few more dishes but didn't want to overdo it. 

as mentioned, an expensive meal is totally okay with me, and the food here was divine, but the experience is just not worth it. there a so many great restaurants in Vegas, at all price levels so we have no reason to return to Nobu.

Their biggest problem... 
WAITERS/SERVER

But let's go through food first. 
Don't order multiple dishes w YUZU sauce, YUZU.. anything. You're tummy will hurt.

1. Yellowtail sashimi with Jalapeno w YUZU sauce. It's WAYYY TOO SOUR. YUZU is sour, but I think they could have done something, so that sourness was tamed. NOT worth $28. You can get great yellowtail, elsewhere for cheaper. And the slices were so freakin' thin. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!

2. beef, pork... skewers. These were actually really great, especially the pork. Very tasty. it's $$$$ for the price, but if you're there to dine, try it. 

3. Tasmanian Ocean Trout w Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu soy. Good, but again, it's very small portion for $28... more trout please. where was my trout? did we get any trout? 

4. Tamago. THE WORST TOMAGO EVER. IT's like salty sweet egg floury cake. NOT TOMAGO. it's more like cake-textured. Tasted AWFUL! NOT WORTH $8. It looks pretty because they ""stamp"" NOBU on it. BUT you're there to dine w your tummy, too. Not just your eyes. 

5. Beef Tenderloin - Toban-yaki. not worth $36. Tasted blah, and portion is def not $36. 

and we ordered couple more dishes.. but I don't recall..

Here's the SERVER/WAITER issue:
If you're restaurant is a FAB restaurant w dishes that are $$$$$, watier/server should not be SELLING YOU or PUSHING YOU to get dishes. Our server/waiter kept pushing us to get all these dishes rather than... recommending. He KEPT saying we should order duplicate dishes when our group wanted a taste of different dishes. He pushed us so much, we got way too many YUZU incorporated dishes... and it was SO TART, SO SOUR... it ruined our appetite. We spent almost 2.5 hours just saying NO...We were asked ""ARE YOU SURE?"" so many times.. I lost count. Had the service been a little better... we'd enjoyed our meal.

We went to Nobu because of all the hype surrounding it. But I was thoroughly disappointed. Will not be making another stop ever again. Thanks, but not thanks.

1315912,2016-06-16,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Thanks to Nobu, I can't truly enjoy Japanese cuisine in my hometown anymore. I've been ruined and awakened at the same time.

As advocated by our very knowledgeable and professional waiter, we had more of an experience than a meal. The usual inquires were made about our tastes and any allergies, then the rest was in the restaurant's hands. I'm glad they took the wheel, and they did not disappoint.

We were served several courses, each topping the next, and as time progressed my friends and I were looking at each other wondering when we were going to hit the finish line. Needless to say I was quite stuffed at the end and so was everyone else.

The highlights of the night were:

-The Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, with a nice salty, citrus, and spicy finish to it. I wish I had asked for a second plate of it.
-Miso Cod: Dear Lord, I don't know how to explain it. If I ever get framed for murder and end up on death row, I'll chose this as my last meal. I can still taste that sweet and savory sauce with that flaked  fish meat. Even the skin of it was amazing.
-Sushi Platter- Needs no explanation, the rice was at the perfect texture, the fish was oh-so fresh, and i didn't even need wasabi to add to it. I wanted to eat it in its pure form. Simply delightful.

The Mochi ice cream was a great finish, but I was too stuffed to try. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it though, and I trust their tastes. I finished my cocktail and had an espresso as a pick-me-up before starting my long night exploring the town.

Overall, I felt the food, service, and drinks were all on point. It was also moderately priced compared to the other restaurants we dined at, and given it's in Vegas, I don't expect anything to be cheap.

Jono, our server & managers behind the bar... fantastic!  They are why I updated my four star Toban-Yaki experience to five.  Two totally different experiences.  

Start w/ a large hot sake cause I promise many of these dishes are complimented by it.  

In order of the BEST most consistently delish Nobu MUST:

TIRADITO SEA URCHIN:  Best in Las Vegas.  Creamy melt in your mouth fresh served on top of a thinly sliced cucumber.  Taste bud organism.

KING CRAB LEG W/ AMAZU PONZU:  Very lite tempura, doesn't overpower the beautiful succulent crab.  Perfectly cooked & plated so make sure to mix the whole dish up before devouring so you get the whole experience.  I usually get it w/ no red onion, just my preference when I'm not sharing. 

BLACK COD MISO:  Melt in your mouth like butter.  It's flaky like seabass & complimented by the sweetness of the miso glaze. The signature glow stick looking garnish is a tasty radish so try it.

AHI TUNA MISO CHIPS:  A burst of flavors!  The ahi is so red & juicy it's like it was just caught & to pair it w/ a chip, wow!  Order it every time now.  

YELLOWTAIL JALAPENO:  Lite fresh, thinly sliced & beautiful. 

The Artichoke Salad, Seafood Soup, Kelp Salad & Octopus Sunomono are all nice starters or sides.  The Dry Miso Spinach Salad is an acquired taste, but it's good.  

Rock Shrimp is filling so I never order that since their are so many other dishes & the SoftShell Crab on Watermelon is seasonal.  

You can't go wrong w/ the sashimi ever & the fresh water eel is devine.  

After my Toban experience, I never get anything from the grilled section & always ask for their signature dish cause the one at HR has a beautiful Yellowtail Red Snapper in Coconut milk baked & then fried.  I like that each one has a special that's off the menu.  The one at Caesars didn't really appeal to me.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,11,6,5,-9H66debmWdtUsjg2bSfbg

1356097,2017-05-14,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Peruvian and Japanese fusion is a fascinating one for me.  We came here with a big group of about 12-14 people and were told that the recommended way to dine was to have the waiter take down our preferences and then curate a menu with the chef based on those preferences and what we hoped to spend per person.  We ended up settling on about $120 per person, which got us about 8 dishes and a big platter of sushi.  I am glad that we did it that way, because I got to try a few different things. 

Before I go into whether the dishes we tried were good, I must preface this with saying that after browsing Yelp - I really wanted to try one particular dish.  I really wanted to try the black cod with miso because of the way people rave about it in the reviews. Well, here am I to rave it about it some more.  If you come here and just try one dish, the black cod with miso has to be the one. It is the most tender, delicious fish I have ever eaten at a restaurant and has ruined me forever for these types of dishes at any other japanese place.  Also, an overall note about this place is that because of the peruvian influence, the dishes are a lot more citrusy than what you would get at a typical japanese place. 

Here are some of the other dishes we got: 

- Shishito Peppers: these were to start. Shishito peppers are shishito peppers and these were done well. Nothing particularly special about shishito peppers to me though. 
- Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno: Not bad, good quality sashimi, like many of the rest of the dishes, more citrusy than typical japanese food. Some in my party were not fans of the citrus flavor, but I really liked it. 
- Snapper with Dry Miso Crumbles, Garlic Chips, Yuzu: I was a big fan of the garlic chips and the fish combination for this one. I would recommend this one over the yellowtail sashimi if you're choosing a sashimi dish because of the unique flavors.
- Rock tempura shrimp: This dish was not very special - it's basically fried shrimp. If you're coming to Nobu, I would recommend getting other things. 

A few of the other dishes were also sashimi type dishes, all with a citrus flavor.  We also got a few beef dishes (one with truffles and one topped with fried onions), which were both quite good.  Finally, they gave us an assortment of sushi (and we also got the toro nigiri on our own). The sushi was pretty good but not super notable.",R2QQkKhREpT9U9Lf0Kliqg,0,2,4,6WPzfSvDP83Frnz278IXcw

The lobster is any preparation style is quite tasty.  And it's nice because the Nobu chefs take out all of the hard work of actually getting the delicious meat out of the lobster shell for you.  You just pluck and gobble.  The only thing that I thought was really NOT good was the fried uni.  Yuck.

The sushi and sashimi is just so-so.  The servings are really chintzy.  Slices of the fish are so thin that you can see through them.  The toro is very sinewy and veiny.  Not melt-in-your-mouth awesomeness.  

But the part about Nobu that I really can't stand is the pretentious attitude of the wait staff.  We were greeted with, ""Have you ever dined at Nobu before?""  When we replied in the affirmative, we were further pushed with: ""Really?  This one?  Here in Las Vegas?""  Like, come on, really?  Why all the faux snobbery?  

You need to watch the upsell though, at Nobu.  They are notorious for it.  You order one thing, and the waiter will tell you, ""If you like THAT, then we've got THIS thing that's NOT on the menu--and you're gonna love it.""

The signature Omakase is a very 'safe' choice to dine... it's composed of classic and popular raw and cooked dishes... nothing too exotic, but perfectly prepared.

Our routine has always been to dine at our longtime favorites (Craftsteak, Mon Ami, Mesa, etc) and to also try a new place or two. Nobu has always been on my ""to try"" list, so I made sure to call a few weeks ahead of our trip to make a reservation. I am so glad that I did! Nobu is probably the best Asian centered dining experience I have ever had. The food matches the visually stunning dining room in both presentation and taste. Our server was incredibly helpful, going to great lengths to make sure our orders matched our dining tastes and expectations. I especially enjoyed the black cod miso, rock shrimp tempura, and scallops in spicy garlic sauce. I am pregnant, so I did not get to experience their world famous sushi, but my husband and dining companions assured me that it did not disappoint. 

For the reviewers who complain about Nobu not being a good value, or that they left hungry...Nobu is not the type of restaurant you go to for value. It is meant to be a culinary experience. You should only go if you can easily afford it. We spent about $175 per person on our meal, and left with zero regrets.

this nobu just opened.
we called around 4pm to make reservation for 7;30-8;00 they told us they are booked out :-( i was so disappointed so after a while the girl on the phone found a table for 6.
so we were a lit bit stressed but ok.when we arrived the restaurant was not busy at all. regarding it is pretty big maybe 8-10??? tables were occupied. so i felt like ok why is this restaurant booked out??????????

hosts very nice & cute girls
service was nice, attentive & ok nothing special what i didnt like was that our server tried to convince us to take the 7 course i think tasting menue for 190$. first of all if a restaurant has so many single items why should i pick a preselected menu??? i dont get it... 

anyway we ordered some sushi & maki rolls. all very good. but not wowed me for that price 10-15$ i think per roll...sushi ws yummy but overpriced they charge per piece!

we ordered the trout it was excellent 28$ our fav dish for that night by far!!!!!!!

we had miso soup7$,  edamame 7$ & shrimp tempura both ok not wow  tempura lil bit soggy for my taste not crunchy enough and again way overpriced 28 $ i think i dont know any more 

dessert bento boxes i had this dish in every nobu but never was so disspointed. the cake was too molten not really baked well. the green tea ice cream sooooooo ridic tiny it fitted on a tiny table spoon. are u kidding me for 15$?????? the 2 blueberries ,1 rasberry just a single joke.
we ordered cocktails kumquat something 16$ was good
we finished around 8;15 with our food & guess what still not packed & overbooked so i have no clue why the girl on the phoe sold us that restaurant as soooo OMG busy on a sunday!!!! night

anyway the bill for 2 was so ridic high that we will not go back. sorry but its vegas   there are so many great restaurants why should i spend $$$ here????

Next I had the black cod which is their best selling dish and it was so good! Must try if it's your first time at Nobu, the Nobu style fish and chips were very good and had a light lemon flavor which really went well with the sauce. 

Last of all I had the sushi which is the only reason this review isn't 5*s, It was bland and really nothing special which I disappointed about.

I came here for a late dinner with my colleagues and we opted for the Omakase Nobu Signature menu because the waiter mentioned that our group would probably easily spend $125 per person anyway if we ordered a la carte. 

The omakase menu is basically a tasting menu. I forget how many different dishes it consists of but it was a good amount to get us all full. My favorites that stood out the most was the black cod miso, shishito peppers, and the hamachi in yuzu sauce. Those three would have to be my top favorites out of the course but every single dish was amazing and there was no complaints whatsoever.

The only thing that would've probably made the experience better was if the food came out at a more timely manner. In the beginning, the food came out everytime we finished a plate and then there was a wait time of maybe 20-30 minutes until the next dish. Then it came out back to back for 2 dishes and we waited another 20 minutes for the last one. Because we didn't know how many courses were being served, we kept assuming that was it and nothing else was coming out. I think the wait time would have been okay if the server checked up on us and updating us on the status to let us know what we do have more dishes coming out and just explaining more of what the dishes were.

Would've been a 5 stars for me if the service was up to par with the quality of the food. Normally I don't like to eat at restaurants in Hotels, but Nobu did not disappoint. I highly recommend! It is pricey so I'd suggest going if you just won some money at the casino or to celebrate a special occasion. It's a real treat.",sCshdCwCQlXh_NVcPeTObg,2,1,4,IuxSia25D0M1p6Li4REk5w

Food was average; it didn't wow us. $$$$ pricing as such one would expect it to be more impressive. We went for teppan and had mixed sushi for appetizer. Toro was $22/pc.; expensive and it's no better than what Benihana serves. A la carte grill we had like crab legs, wagyu, shrimp, scallop, lamb, foie gras were all decent. Again, just the food cost us about $250+/person, so I was hoping at least one item would wow me but none. 

-2 stars for our server. 
I wish I could remember his name. That night he served our teppan table and another party sitting next to us. Water glasses and tea cups went empty a few times and had to ask for refill, but this didn't bother me as much as the fact that each refill took 10 minutes to happen (not to mention the server sent busboy to assist us). I saw our server attended the other table frequently, pouring sake (which we ordered a large bottle as well), refilling their tea/water,  and checking on them on the food. Perhaps the server didn't find us fun enough to be around, but we did enjoy our chef and we tipped him well after cooking for us. The server only came by when we asked for the bill and spoke to us FINALLY when he thought we didn't give any gratuity. Honestly, I really didn't think he deserves a penny. The tips we left were for the busboys who served us the entire night.

The food we had at other Nobu's such as Malibu didn't wow us either, but we had a great server and made us feel welcomed. Our dining experience here did not meet any expectation, and I hope it was an isolated incident.

They brought out the Miso Soup that was lukewarm and tasted like it came from a packet. The Edamame tasted like it was previously frozen. The Yellowtail Sashimi did not taste fresh, it had more of a ceviche texture. The Uni did not taste fresh, in fact it was extremely bland. The Premium Sashimi Dinner came with 3 pieces of otoro that was cut into blocks and throughout the entire piece had a membrane intact that was near impossible to chew through. Rock Shrimp Tempura literally is fried shrimp doused in a mayonnaise textured sauce. The Vegetable Tempura was some of the worst I've had.

My husband and I love sushi, so we thought this would be a real treat since it's hyped to be the ""best sushi ever"". We were left really unimpressed. The rolls we ordered we good, but not special in any way. I wasn't blown out of the water. We also got some skewers, beef and shrimp with the sauce that wasn't teriyaki. The sauce was good, and I did enjoy the shrimp, but again it didn't seem special. Nothing to write home about. Aside from the subpar food, what left a sour taste in our mouths was also that they had asked us if we were celebrating anything when we booked the reservation, and I said it was my husband's 30th birthday. Nothing was done for us at all, the waiter said ""oh and happy birthday"" when bringing back our check after already taking our card. I definitely don't expect singing, since it's a fancier place but no small single person serving dessert? Like they can't afford that? What's the point in asking what we are celebrating if they don't do anything? Also a $3 fee for a side of spicy mayo, which seems weird but ok. I felt like we were treated poorly since we weren't ordering alcohol and stuck with water, they acted like we couldn't afford to be there or something from the moment we said we were fine with water.

An alternative omakase will be the Nobu's selection for ($125)... this one, you won't be able to try the daily chef's special. Since we're in Las Vegas... I lived by the motto ""Go Big or Go Home!"". So, without any regrets... $175 it is!

If you refer to my pictures, those are the items served to me that night. Everything was blasting with flavors I've never tried elsewhere. I was blown away. 

The omakase already comes with dessert, but we decided to add the shaved ice for all of us to share. It is huge and definitely enough to share among the 7 of us.

Besides the food, the cocktail menu has pretty good mixtures of alcohol and ingredients. I got to the try Grapefruit on the Rocks and Sidecar. Both are very good! And of course being a restaurant that serves alcohol, they have wine, beer, and hard liquor as well.

When I approached the hostess stand I wasn't even greeted. When the hostess finally acknowledged I was standing there she looked up once with a smirk on her face and asked if we had a reservation. I said no and from there she proceeded to tell us the wait would be approximately 30-40 min. I was fine with waiting as we were walk ins and it was clear the restaurant was extremely busy. The part that I couldn't get over was how terribly rude the hostess was while taking down our information. Absolutely zero eye contact and the ugliest attitude I've ever encountered. About 25 minutes go by and a couple sits down next to us. They did not have a reservation and the reason I know this is I overheard them talking about not having one and the gentleman told the lady he was with not to worry and That he would get them a table right away. He goes back up to the hostess stand and spends a few minutes there and he was correct. Got them right in. I couldn't believe it. They had just got there, had no reservation just like us and got right in. Once that happened I went up to the hostess and asked why she sat that couple before us. She proceeded to tell me they had a reservation which was a complete lie. By this time I was upset and definitely called her out on her lie and asked that we too be seated. She was happy to argue with me and told me she hAd nothing available and that if we wanted to eat there we would have to continue to wait probably another 10-15 min. I went to sit back down then noticed a bunch of room at the sushi bar. I walked over and grabbed the first two seats and sat down. The hostess ran over and told us that we couldn't sit there and that we needed to move to the other side of the sushi bar. By now I was furious and seriously couldn't believe what I was hearing! I told her I preferred to stay right where I am and she insisted I had to move because in her words ""it's not sanitary to sit there."" That was a first. The table wasn't even dirty and the only things that were missing were two set ups. I told her if the table was dirty then to send someone to wipe it down and I preferred to stay right where I'm at. She then told me it was against Health code and I had to literally laugh in her face because I'm sorry, that is complete and total BS! We ended up moving because all we wanted to do was eat and leave. All this girl did was be rude and argue with me from the second I arrived. It made my dining experience the worst I had ever had and I couldn't wait to just eat my food and get out of there! The hostess should be the face of the restaurant and if I were the manager of this restaurant I would definitely get rid of that girl. She clearly doesn't enjoy her job and doesn't belong in the hospitality industry. I'm glad I'm a local and from now on go to the Nobu at The Hard Rock Hotel.

  First off, the server wasn't very informative, so I talked to another server passing by, she actually gave me some good guidance. We ordered a wide range of items, going off their recommendations. We started with sashimi yellowtail with jalapeños. Of course it was good, Yuzu makes anything rock, and fresh raw fish does it's job well, no help needed. Second was the lobster ceviche. I found it boring, uninspired, bland. Sorry.   Third was the new style sashimi, salmon. This was by far the best. Slightly cooked, warm sesame, miso sauce. Delish.  Main courses were the black cod miso,a restaurant favorite, but not my favorite. I just kinda ate it, without having any real feelings for it. I was just thinking ok, maybe the next plate will be better. Creamy spicy rock shrimp tempura, I had two pieces and decided it was time to order a freakin sushi roll and call it quits. I'm hungry and not so impressed. Thank god I wasn't paying.  I ordered the nobu roll I believe, it had ahi tuna, yellowtail, avocado, scallion, masago.

The entire evening was incredible!
The feeling of the restaurant is contemporary and stylish, yet warm and romantic.
We decided to try the tasting menu, it was $125 per person, but worth every penny! My husband and I tried things that would have never crossed our palate had we not opted for this choice. I believe it was 8 courses, but I kind of lost track after four.
I really enjoyed the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, salmon tartare with caviar, cod (their signature dish) and the dessert of molten lava cake and green tea ice cream.
For drinks I had the Dalia and the Mango Passion, both were delicious, but the Mango was my favorite (It was recommended by our waiter). The drinks were kind of pricey at around $17.

The waiter didn't help much. We're much more into the cooked side of the Nobu menu (they have a lot of non-sashimi and sushi options) and have always found a helpful waiter who guides us the right direction. This waiter had no time or desire to do so.

I need to begin by saying that I have been to Nobu restaurants in over eight locations worldwide.  I was at his first USA restaurant in NYC shortly after it opened.  I have always had an excellent experience until I dined at Nobu in Caesar's with two co-workers.  Yes, it is pricey...everything on the Vegas Strip is pricey and price was not the issue. Not being served your entrée was the issue.  I sat patiently while everyone was eating their food...there was a gap of about 15 to 20 minutes between when the first person's entrée was served to when the second person received theirs.  So, we all assumed my entree would arrive in the same time frame. So, I sat there...waiting. Our server was nowhere to be found.  Finally, when everyone else had finished their meals our server finally showed up and I inquire about my food status.  She looked shocked and said that it might take a bit longer. In the meantime she offered me a sushi roll...promising me that it would take 5 minutes to arrive...20 minutes later the wrong roll arrives.  I ate it anyway.  20 minutes after that an entrée was delivered to my table...the wrong entrée.  15 minutes later, my entrée does arrive....cold.  No apology from the server.  However, she did make a point of telling us that the entrée was removed from the bill.  The manager was called over, who again did not apologize and truly he did not care that I was leaving his restaurant without eating but did volunteer to take a whopping 20% off the bill.  Therefore, we all left Nobu with a bad taste in our mouths and me with an empty stomach.",VavwkZaZIwauFq4l8Q8k7Q,0,0,1,NxIv4F1NITURibUcXM16Mw

I forgot our server name but she was super attentive and nice. We started with two orders of ungi, four Toro, and one order of Hamachi. All were really good. Not as fresh as the Nobu in Oahu but it was still good. For our main course we got the 6oz Waygu, Lobster (special of the day), and the Alaskan King Crab. Love everything except the Crab Leg. For 75 I was expecting a bigger leg than the one we got. It looks like they went to the Buffet in Caesar and took one of the crab leg and put some Uni. I did like the sauce. 

Our second visit here we ordered the two specials of the day which was the Toro w/ 7yrs aged soy sauce and truffle oil and the Bone In Rib Eye Waygu w/ fried onion and truffle oil. Now these two dishes is worth coming back for. The Toro was so soft and buttery! We had two order anther 6 pieces because that's how good it is. About 6-8 pieces was around 100. The Rib Eye was 6oz and was filled with fried onions. I like the flavor but it did get salty after 4 bites. This dish was about 100 too. We wanted to try another dish so we decided to get the Black Cod Miso. I know Nobu is known for this dish so I didn't understand why it came out super salty. I ate the Black Cod in Oahu and it wasn't this salty. I'll skip on this dish while dining in this Nobu. Our server nick name is Columbia and he's was amazing!!

The mushroom soup here and the spicy seafood soup are absolutely to die for.  Our server was excellent - attentive, friendly and helpful.  The decor and ambience are delightful.

However, we ordered the seafood specials - Toro sashimi and salmon belly.  They were both pretty good.  The skin on the ""crispy"" salmon skin roll was soggy and the pieces were much too large.  We ordered a bottle of the Nigori unfiltered Sake to complement the meal - a good choice but the $70 price tag underscores what Nobu is about .... $.

Our total bill came to about $300 (which was about what I expected) but I was disappointed yet again by many of the little details.  As an example, Nobu uses cheap bamboo chopsticks very similar to the ones you get at Panda Express.  On this occasion my girlfriend got a nasty splinter in her finger that made it very uncomfortable for her to eat.  The EMTs at Caesar's Palace came to help us remove it but they are not allowed to handle tweezers and/or needles so we had to settle for a bandaid.  During this entire incident the manager came by once and then scurried away.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is fairly casual, not cramped, and the decor is simple and warm.  There are perfect settings for larger groups or intimate dining experiences.

Something that made our experience so enjoyable was our server, who provided some great recommendations after we told him what type of dining experience we were after.  He was also able to provide us with some equivalents to some favourite dishes from Nobu in SanDiego.

Favourite dishes, in no particular order:

1.  Wagyu beef- we ordered 10oz, and although quite pricey, totally worth every penny.  The presentation at the table, of the beef on hot rocks and flambeed at the table was followed by the most melt-in-your-mouth beef you'll try this side of Japan!

2.  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno- I might have to use melt-in-your-mouth many times during this review.... the yellowtail was so delicious and included 6 pieces on the plate.  Although not a large portion, each little bite was satisfying!

3.  Rock Shrimp Jalapeno- the sauce on the rock shrimp was so flavourful, with a slight spiciness to it. It was served over greens which were perfect for getting the last its of the sauce from the serving dish.

4.  Black Cod Miso-  this perfectly cooked fish falls apart at the slightest touch, and is infused with the wonderful, slightly salty miso flavour.

Other dishes that were quite good included the red snapper***, and the seafood soup.  The only dish that was disappointing was the salmon belly*** which was the waiter's recommendation as it is a favourite dish at Nobu.  It wasn't as good as the yellowtail or snapper, and it seemed way overpriced at $50 for 6 pieces.

We did order some sushi rolls, which kind of seemed unnecessary after the other indulgences we had just had, and they weren't anything special compared to other good sushi restaurants.

Some reviewers balk at the Nobu prices, but I think people need to consider what they're looking for before they head to Nobu.  If you're looking for high quality food, tastefully presented, and a high end atmosphere, then the price is worth it... maybe only once a year though!",VvJzTulR17HDj7PDyc789g,1,1,5,Ynyl34VBBt-Yxbc-DY8gcg

The glowing reviews of this place led me to book it for my boyfriend's birthday but it was seriously the most overpriced food and worst service I experienced in Vegas.

1. Tuna Miso Chips. This was a slice of raw tuna served on what equated to a not so crispy waffle cut potato chip garnished with some greens and a sauce that did not go well with the tuna. 
2. Miso Black Cod. This was the LEAST worth it dish of all. Everyone raves about this dish and I was expecting a nice sized piece of black cod but what I got were 4 TINY appetizer bites. The cod was good but why serve this on a random bed of butter lettuce garnished with the same white noodles in the center as the tuna miso chips. Serious lack of creativity. 
3. Hamachi Kama. This was the best dish of all four but that is not saying much. The fish was at least tender. 
4. Joyce Farms Chicken. The chicken was tender on this but I did not like the sauce. 
5. Dessert. After the fails above, did you think I was going to be stupid and order dessert?

I came here for a work related dinner. They basically did omakase for the table. The cooked food was generally good - the black cod miso in a lettuce wrap stuck out. The wagyu beef that you cook on hot stones was fun but it wasn't something I'd be jumping to try again - it got annoying when the stones started to cool down. 

When it came to the raw fish, there was little difference in quality when compared to an average SF neighborhood sushi place. If anything their spicy tuna and california rolls (which they included in the omakase) were noticeably subpar - and they definitely used imitation crab meat for the CA rolls. Maybe decent sushi is an accomplishment out in the desert but I don't see why it should be as expensive as it apparently is (I didn't see the bill but the people taking us out did a double take.).

We come in and order drinks - just the usual martinis. Just as a reminder I asked Victoria F, the server, if the hostess has communicated that it was our anniversary. She appeared courteous, although I sometimes sensed some annoyance from her part. Maybe she had a bad day.

They took a very long time just to get our drink order. We had also sat there for at least 20 minutes before they even brought the food menus. The menu is very complex, so it would have been nice to be able to review it from the moment we sat down. Once we did order, the food came pretty quickly and everything was delicious. Just a warning if you order any of the tacos off the cold dishes though, they are the smallest things I've ever seen. They were good, but the waiter was pushing family style and there was no way to share those unless you ordered 2 per person. The gyoza dumplings, black cod miso and rock shrimp were especially delicious. It was very pricy but it's Vegas so I wasn't surprised by that.

BUYER BEWARE - they will try to SCAM you into an expensive bill!!!!! 

My friend and I sat down starving asking for a menu. The waitress asked us if we've ever been there before - to which we answered no. (I'm sure this is where she knew she could get us.) She then tells us that they don't do menus here. She continues by saying their menus are 'vague' and 'hard to understand'. It is her job to find the best items for you on the menu and bring those to you. She starts by pushing 2 sashimi  items and then says she will serve us with a hot dish and then something else (I stopped listening and cut her off). I told her very straight and to the point that we were only interested in rolls. Again....she told us she is bringing us the 2 sashimi. Honest to God, she would not take no for an answer!!! Finally, we agreed because it felt like we were arguing with her and it was putting a damper on our night. We then insisted that we do NOT want the hot menu - we only want rolls. Again, she starts pushing it on us. I've never seen any restaurant so pushy!!! After she brought us the 2 sashimi rolls, I started to panic what the price of these were because something felt shady. Again, I insisted on a menu (for the like 5th time). She brought the menu and the menu was NOT hard to understand or vague - she completely lied to us!!!! And....you will love this....those 2 items were $60 plus tax and tip and we didn't even like them!!! I asked to speak to a manager about this and the manager refused to come over and refused to even reduce the price of these over priced dishes that were forced upon us. We ended up ordering some rolls and I've got to be honest, they were horrible! I'm so perplexed how anyone could give this restaurant a good review? The ambience was below average...food was awful and the service was deceptive - not to mention the prices here were insane!!! Honestly, we felt like we had been scammed! It ruined our night. I really think they know most people eating their are tourists and will never be back. Therefore, I believe they try to scam you into paying for expensive dishes and then once you get the bill, the manager refuses to reduce the price. If you look at previous reviews, other people have gone through something similar. BEWARE!!! 

The next evening we went to Koi and OMG...I can't believe the difference!!! They had the most amazing sushi, beautiful ambience and the best service! It was my birthday and they brought over a free cocktail and a free desert. Nobu would have charged us for that - probably double the normal cost!!! In addition, Koi's sushi had all those amazing sauces - where Nobu doesn't believe in sauces - which is part of why their rolls suck!",xVy5MD9V8wrCuPkbbseLvA,1,0,1,b7kmVIhX7d4UghlJZcnEkw

However, be prepared to spend at least $100-200 per person. At the very least. Regardless, I keep coming back. 

What to order: The signature tasting menu is the best deal at $125 and has more mainstream appeal and tastier options IMO than the daily special for $175, which is for the ultra adventurous aka eating a whole river crab in one bite - shell, claws, eyes and all. Next time I go I'm going to have the waiter help me pick my own custom tasting menu. I think that's the play because you'll get everything you like and nothing you don't like.

Nobu is pretty well-known since so many celebrities love to wine-and-dine here, so I was super excited to have my Vegas experience, especially since we already enjoy going to the Malibu location!

Because this restaurant is SO popular, it's highly recommend to put in a reservation...My brother made reservations for a party of 6, 2 months ago. 
After arriving 15 minutes late due to Strip traffic, the restaurant was understanding and still got us seated pretty quick. Our Suhricka was absolutely on point last night and for her customer service alone we want to give 5 stars, thanks girl! 

Time to get to the main attraction, the grub.
So the idea for this restaurant is to order multiple plates to share amongst the table, tapas style so by the time you leave your comfortably full without feeling too stuffed. 
Everything that we ordered last night was ridiculously delicious. Things like yellow-tail, which I normally wouldn't eat, I tried and loved it! 
Definitely stepped out of my comfort zone with a lot of the dishes, and I'm so glad I did! Please refer to my many pictures and feel free to hit me up on any further information about a specific dish. Like I said, everything we order was delicious to the starters, main entreès and to dessert, ALL AMAZING!

First of all, they charged me for more waygu steak than we actually had--the reason I know this is because I took a video of the steak being lit on fire on the rocks). Also, when I ordered a bottle of wine I thought it was the cheapest on the red wine menu and I told our waiter that, however, somehow I got a $330.00 bottle of wine. He asked why I chose that wine and I said it was because that was the cheapest. Why did he not correct me? At the beginning of dinner we were looking at the chef special priced around $300 each--which we were more than willing to spend, we are foodies and we have no problem spending money on good food. After speaking to our waiter though, he persuaded us to go with a menu that the chef would put together for us. He said that we would get more ""bang for our buck"" and we would get to try more of the menu. He asked us questions and depending on our preferences--that is how the meal was created. Since he said we would get more bang for our buck, we went with this option rather than the $300 chef special. BIG MISTAKE. After a beautiful dinner, we got a bill of $1,300.00. Yes you read that right, $1,300.00 FOR ME AND MY MOTHER. I was full, but not thirteen hundred dollars full.

2085929,2017-09-21,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"My boyfriend and I were doing well in the casinos so we decided to treat ourselves to dinner at Nobu! Each of us had been once before at home in Waikiki. 

We had no reservations because they were booked, but we were able to walk in and be seated immediately at the Sushi bar. 

We decided on the most expensive Omakase (chef's choice) meal. There were  some options for Omakase. You could choose between a pre selected menu by Nobu for $125/pp or the literal Chef's choice for $225/pp. We opted for the $225. 

Of course we started with drinks! I chose the Pinot Grigio (they only offer one and it is an Italian wine at $14/glass). My bf opted for the Peanut Bourbon and Jelly which he describes as smooth and slightly sweet. 

I can't quite remember every single item we were served but, I took pictures of every course and will try my best to title them respectively! 

There were about 6 courses that ranged from 2 pieces to several mini dishes within the course. They also included an ocean salad dish, a foie gras miso soup and dessert. The variety of fish I can rememer we were served were: otoro, Japanese baracuda, and akamutsu. There were different cuts of different grades of fish so there were definitely more than just 3 types. In addition to the salad, soup and several sushi courses we had: Japanese oysters, Maine lobster, and Wagyu (grade 5?). 

Although they ask us at the start of the meal if we are on any time constraints, our only gripe was that the time between courses was very long. Our meal lasted about 2.5 hours. We think it was bc we chose the literal Chef's choice not the pre selected chef's choice.

Service was excellent, each time we left the table they refolded our napkins and they were constantly clearing our finished plates and wiping our area clean for the next course. The sushi bar didn't seem like that tight of a squeeze until the woman seated next to me kept bumping me with her purse, elbows, and arms as she spoke very animated with arm gestures. We were able to scoot away from her because there were some empty seats to our right.  

All in all, it was my first time trying Omakase and I was completely satisfied. I'd definitely shell out the cash to do it again for a special occasion!",wNSpG0MJ6x5NSoXqyXgj9A,2,1,5,r8DE4ZKzoy4amrV1dirgog

At last I got to experience the great food that Nobu has to offer! You have no idea how excited I was to try out one of the many Nobu restaurants. And let me tell you this, this was definitely THE best fine dining experiences I have had (And I have been blessed to have quite a few). Yes, it is super expensive. But people, come on, see the Yelp $$$$ sign and go through the menu because they do list prices before you decide to dine here. Expect to pay anywhere between $100-$150 per person. 
Our experience was wonderful right from the get go. We had reservations for 2 at 10PM on Saturday, 1/30/16. We planned on dining here after catching a show, but we got out of the show sooner than we expected. Since we were staying at the Nobu hotel, it was convenient to just walk up and ask if they could seat us earlier. Ashley at the front desk was helpful and did get us an earlier reservation and called us about the same. Our table was phenomenal. We got one of the booth like tables, with a view of the bar and virtually every other table. This was perfect for people watching while enjoying our meal ;-)
Amber was our assigned waitress for the night. And she definitely contributed to making it great by making recommendations and good ones at that. She wasn't pushy and explained things when we had questions. And we had a few, given that the food at Nobu is a Peruvian Japanese blend. So, it's not just sushi, sashimi and miso based items, they also have tacos with a Japanese influence and ceviche. I also found out that Tiradito is basically a ceviche as well!
Nobu doesn't really have very many warm sakes on their menu. They aren't known for their sake. So, if you are a sake connoisseur, head to barMASA instead. We ordered the only warm sake they have to offer. But it did hit the right spot. We also ordered sake based cocktails. I ordered one was with coconut water and my husband with Japanese whiskey (Yamakazi). Unfortunately, the cocktails were unimpressive. 

We didn't opt for the Omakase style dinner or the family style dinner. It just seemed like a lot of food for the two of us. If you are a bigger group, you could opt for either one of these. We opted to order off the menu straight.
Between the two of us, we tried:
Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - This is the BOMB. the Yuzu sauce was perfectly complementing the sashimi. And the sashimi basically just melted in our mouths. Be sure to add a leaf of cilantro on top of the jalapeno and bite it all together. Flavors just burst in your mouth.
Shishito Peppers - These are a must order at Nobu. The sesame sauce atop the peppers adds a wonderful flavor. We ordered 2 of these!
Scallops with Wasabi pepper - This dish was a bit underwhelming. It's more gravy style and would probably be fantastic with a side of rice. But it is something that I can make at home. Not worth forking the monies on.
Uni Nigiri - Having lived in SF and experienced fresh uni here, I had my expectations of what it should be like perfectly set - creamy avocado like without the fishy taste. And I kid you not, the uni at Nobu lived upto my expectations. It was perfect! Order this for sure.
Big eye tuna nigiri - My husband ordered a piece of this and it just disappeared.
Vegetable tempura - Now I am not a sushi/sashimi snob. But after you've consumed sushi and sashimi with seafood, the vegetable option seems like a downer and a sheer waste of money. But my husband still wanted his veggies. And the tempura here is perfectly fried and not oily at all.
Spicy Scallop roll - I didn't taste much spicy or the scallop. The green onion flavor overpowered the rest. It tasted great overall.
For dessert, we ordered the fried banana with sesame ice cream. This just hit the spot!

I think more than anything else, what impressed me was the service we received. Everyone from the seating hostess to our waitress to the food servers and the manager on duty, everyone was extremely courteous and very attentive. I do want to check out the other Nobu locations.

My favorite location is still in Malibu - but I've been to the locations in NY, both Vegas locations, Bahamas, Malibu, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Diego. My dream still includes hitting the Tokyo Nobu and the Monte Carlo Nobu...

This location is new - anytime I was in Vegas, I would hit the Hard Rock location and it was awesome. It's smaller, more intimate in nature and the servers are hot and usually have accents.. (a plus)

This location is great for larger parties though, we had 60 people in our group and they had a room that accommodated us nicely.  Huge round tables with ""lazy susans"" were situated in partiality secluded nooks that were open to the center of the room where more rounds and one long table were setup. This allowed us all to move around and mingle but kept the over all noise level down. It was both a big party and an intimate one. 

They also have a dining room for dates and small groups that has some great nooks and intimate little areas to talk and be with that special someone over some sake and sashimi..  The bar is very cool and they have some awesome cocktails to try. I had something I  loved but unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of it.. it has an orchid on it though and is served in a martini glass.. so describe that if you love sweet drinks with a little bite!

My favorites remain the same:

Yellow tail with japapeno
Black cod
Sashimi Tacos
and the Kobe on a hot rock

I was sat at the sushi bar.  It took over 15 minutes for anyone to come and give me a menu, and then I was left again for an absurd amount of time before my drink order was taken.  The ""supervisor"" at the sushi bar kept having to pull random waiters to come take my order throughout the night.  Needless to say, the service left much to be desired, although I will say all the waiters, when they did eventually come,  were very nice.

The next disappointment was the fact that I ordered a sashimi platter.  I expected a beautiful plate of fresh fish that tasted as good as it looked.  Honestly, the presentation was nothing beyond anything I would get here in Chicago, and the taste was fine, but definitely not anything I would put above my other favorite sushi restaurants.  

Struggling with the fact I was not satisfied with my sashimi, I ordered the mushroom soup.  That was very good with many different earthy mushrooms in a clear broth.  I did like this.

Still not sent over the moon though, I asked the waiter for a recommendation for a hot dish.  He recommended the king crab tempura.  It was good, however the sauce was extremely overbearing with acidity and it is presented that the crab is sitting in the sauce so there is not much control over how much you can use.  

Overall, I was disappointed with not only the food I received, but it was extremely overpriced.

1.  the oyster shooters--- my first time trying this dish and it went down so smooth.

2. Yellowtail with jalapeno- fish was very fresh and the sauce was light and flavorful. This was very good!

3. Steamed Cod- This tasted just like sea bass. The fish was fresh and very meaty. Lots of flavor and very moist. It was garnished with pickled ginger- this was the best ginger I have ever had!

4. Steamed Seabass- After trying the cod, the seabass did not compare. It was served in a bowl with a soy based sauce- garnished with enoki mushrooms and bok choy. I didn't really care for the sauce. I felt that it took away from the flavor of the fish.

I never order off menu because I usually get experienced servers that recommend dishes to my party. Today On my Birthday I expected the same type of  treatment. 
Our server seemed annoyed when he spoke to my party when I asked him to recommend something special off he recommended. Eel roll, crab roll..... I kept asking him to recommend specials I wanted more effort from Him I obviously sound like I know how to eat and that's the shit you recommend me? I even placed an order for toro & black truffle carpaccio to give him an idea of the kind of palette we have. He was obviously did not know the menu well himself & had a bad attitude about it. 
The food was good as usual. I really enjoyed the toro with black truffle but then he turned us off by telling us it was from a can.

2269688,2015-10-16,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Five star service with three star food...overall, I am still a fan. Heather provided some of the best service we have ever had...even though we basically closed the place, she cheerfully took the time to answer all our questions, provided amazingly attentive service, didn't rush us, and pretty much made our day. We didn't even order any booze.

We had the $125 omakase dinner...Heather arranged it so that one of the courses would be the Wagyu course (ordinarily $38!!! an ounce). The food was for the most part OK...I guess I can't really taste the difference between regular neighborhood sushi and that from fish that flew first class from Japan in a Louis Vuitton tank, and presumably was massaged, fed first growth Bordeuxs and truffles and foie gras. I mean, holy moly, that sushi was expensive! And, it must be said, one course was probably the least plesant thing I have ever put in my mouth...I'll pause here to let that sink in a minute. The halibut sashimi had raw okra...wow...who was the genius that decided to use raw okra??? Have they ever tasted that??? One bite and I could feel my mouth fill with mucous (from the mucin in the okra)...the more I chewed the more mucous was produced...ugggh. It felt like some hocked a loogie in my mouth. I literally could not swallow this...I had to take a big swig of water just to get it down my throat. Whew!

After surviving this, we were served Nobu's signature Miso Roasted Black Cod...this was the first time I had tasted this iconic dish, though I have had plenty of imitators. I actually felt that it was undercooked, as it was still translucent, and a touch too sweet. The biggest disappointment was that my ""fillet"" was loaded with bones. The second disappointment was that about one minute after the cod came out, they brought out the wagyu tataki. Since this was basically the price of gold and was cooking its way to oblivion on the hot stones, we had to switch our attention to the beef. Now this was amazing...having never had true Japanese Wagyu before, I was surprised at how much it tasted like foie gras...literally melting in my mouth. Now THIS was well worth the cost.

The miso soup tasted like, well, miso soup. The desert had green tea ice cream and a bitter chocolate cake...it was kind of...gross.

The shock we received was when we received our check...Heather had comp'd our Wagyu. She explained that she had noticed that I had picked aside a lot of bones in my cod, and that my wife didn't even have a chance to eat much of hers because the Wagyu was brought out too early. We hadn't even mentioned anything, but Heather had noticed and taken care of it. Wow...I was speechless. This was going above and beyond.

Overall, I  found the decor and setting to be wonderfully elegant, in a Japanese minimalist sort of way. What was surprising was that the service was not stuffy or pompous in any way. In a way, this was the best ""bargain"" of our trip!",cHZhssS9U7FXOsxUDISNVQ,2,2,4,9N9HcgygFL7eP4n3pYNHEw

Very inattentive and disorganized staff. That being said, the food was very good. The fish was fresh and the plating was spectacular. The depth of flavors and uniqueness of the courses was appreciated , however they  forgot the miso soup and served it at the end of the meal. We will not be returning to Nobu's.

I had the following (Ones with the '*' are a must have)

- Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno *
- Black Cod Miso *
- Squid 'pasta' with Light Garlic
- Akadashi Soup
- Shrimp Tempura Roll*
- California Roll

Let me just say, I went in there not liking raw or cooked fish. This experience completely changed my mind. My waiter insisted that I try the Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno and the Black Cod Miso. I had a YOLO moment (yes I said YOLO, I know, I'm very cool) and went a head and ordered it. I always thought that raw fish would be very fishy but, this dish was so fresh and expertly prepared it had no fishy taste and a very nice buttery mouth feel. Then the Black Cod Miso had a very buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The flavor was very umami with the caramelized miso and the saltiness from the cod. 

The Squid 'pasta' with Light Garlic was very creative. The squid very much well resembled a pasta such as an Orecchiette or a Cencioni shape. The vegetables did not fit in with the Japanese/ Peruvian influence theme but over all, it was a great dish. The Soup was full of flavor and the seaweed was a nice touch.

They say that their sushi is not their specialty but believe me it was phenomenal. Since it was my first night of having fish I did not want to try all of the raw sushi so I stay with what I liked, Shrimp Tempura and a California Roll. They were both amazing.

2374811,2016-02-16,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"(2.5 stars) I almost dread writing this review because prior to our dining experience I expected to give it 5 stars, phone home to my momma to tell her how great it was and then fantasize about the food for weeks until our next special occasion, however, that is not the case.

We were greeted by 3 sweet lovely hostesses and seated promptly when we arrived. Perhaps one luxury of being a local is being prepared with proper dinner attire and getting a baby sitter but I guess for some that's asking a bit much. It almost felt like Olive Garden with the casual outfits and all the children. Even the service staff uniform is black tshirts which is much different than the white long sleeve button up shirts that we are used to in most fine dining restaurants.

Dinner was $470 for the two of us including gratuity. We enjoyed our meal but it was nowhere near orgasmic (can I write that?). Keep in mind we like ponzu, my husband actually loves it but this was overkill. We had a shrimp and lobster roll that was great, mixed cerviche that was the highlight of our meal and tartar which was  ground up beyond recognition and somehow swimming in some sauce, a large sake that we only finished half of (don't order large unless you're an alcoholic, a party of 4 or a conisouer of sake), smoked salmon which was the equivalent of warm locks on rice, yellowtail that was good, the house roll that was also just good and a few other ""good"" items. 

Our server seemed like a nice guy but he wasn't exactly smooth in his deliverance and he wasn't very personable. He was in no way deserving of the 15% we left him but it's basically against my religion to leave anything less. I couldn't tell you his name to save my life but I can certainly compliment all the food runners and the bussers. They were very detailed in their explanations of the food and quick to get rid of used plates.

It's probably too late to say long story short but Ill say it anyways, long story short it's ""good"" food, very pricey, small portions, loud and more of a happy hour atmosphere than the fine dining experience that I thought it would be. I could have gone to AYCE in my yoga pants with my 2 year old and have been just as happy so I doubt we will be back because we love Sushi Samba at the Palazzo much better for a fun sushi/Peruvian dinner.",V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,3,1,3,9X6wHAe3FrAlMbuY_MwTwg

We got the squid pasta donburi which had the most tender pieces of squid. You mix everything together and the garlic soy and seasonal veggies (asparagus, shitake, squash, broccoli) really came together well. Add a little oshinko and mmmmm mmmm.

We also were ecstatic that they had the bento (only offered sat/sun for lunch) which includes all their signature dishes including the miso black cod and the creamy/citrus rock shrimp tempura. A good ""bargain"" to try out a variety of things. The bento also included sushi but I was not that impressed as the nigiri were tiny and salmon roll generic.

Nobu's interior is lovely-mushroom-shaped lanterns float above the dark interior and low light creates an intimate dining experience. The table setting is charming, with a rock to prop your chopsticks upon. Our server gave excellent recommendations throughout the evening, and his first was my drink-a mango passionfruit concoction which was sweet and dangerous-zero taste of alcohol. A delicious start to the evening. We ordered edamame, which had delicious salt sprinkled atop. It was good! And then the fun began...we had SO many dishes, each outshining the next. Tiny tacos were the first to arrive. I popped a tiny lobster taco, and it was superb. Crisp shell with amazing lobster and a creamy sauce (we ordered another round of tacos later because they were splendid). Then the yellowtail with jalapeño, a signature of the restaurant. Outstanding. Heat from the jalapeño and clean, cold perfect yellowtail made for an amazing dish. Rock shrimp tempura was a huge hit-we ordered the standard sauce. Light and crunchy tempura with a buttery and tangy sauce, an absolute star  Later in the evening, we ordered the Chilean sea bass tempura-another hit. It was buttery and paired with a lighter sauce (ponzu, maybe?). That sauce was flavorful and interesting and so worth it. Pork belly skewers were next on the list. Incredible. Out of this world. So well-flavored and crisp on the top and melty (""melty"" is not a word, but NOBU took so many of my adjectives that I am reduced to making up new words), creamy, flavorful goodness. It was a winner. And then-the black cod. Everything about it surprised me. It is a large piece of fish, and our group tentatively began pulling pieces off and using our chopsticks to break off segments. It is slippery, so I definitely struggled But once I got it situated and took a bit, I was floored. So buttery, so flavorful, so rich, so decadent, and so unmatched. It is a must order. Just glorious. Phew-I am reviewing our meal in the order we ate each dish, and I need a moment to bask in the glow of the black cod before moving on. It was a masterpiece. Okay, I'm ready Right after the black cod dish, we shared a simple salmon roll (cut). Honestly, I was not expecting much, and this roll surprised me-it was incredibly flavorful.

I told her about my call this morning, but all she said was that she was sorry for the miscommunication. My friends & I were hungry & irritated, but we decided to wait anyways because all restaurants probably had a long wait time since it was dinner time. 

Before I start commenting on the food, please keep in mind that my friends & I are a huge fan of sushi & Japanese cuisine, so we've eaten at numerous sushi joints & had high hopes for this place since it was expensive & well-known. 

I understand that sushi is an expensive experience overall, but this place was a big disappointment. We started off with a few cocktail drinks recommended by the waitress & some oyster shooters (yummy!). As for our dishes, we ordered the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño (fresh, but mediocre), which was recommended by our waitress as one of their signature dish. Next, we had the wagyu taco (meat was soft, but it came in two & was REALLY small). As for sushi & sashimi, we ordered the scallop sashimi & salmon belly - both of which are super overpriced for $6-7 per piece & the cut wasn't even that big, tuna cut (tiny & nothing special) & the house special ($17 for nothing special). The rock shrimp was just fried battered shrimp mixed in with spicy mayo. The only dish that was good was the black cod miso - had a sweet glazed taste.

Coming here, we've already expected to pay $100+/person, but we expected the food to be superb. Overall, this place is expensive for mediocre food that I could've eaten elsewhere for half the price. No thanks.",u0sKl32W0gyqXm9TMBCRhQ,3,0,1,JJ3BBKoIbb_eFv6Am9RMoA

The sampler is very filling as it includes about twelve dishes ranging from seafood to steak, and all packed with amazing flavors!

To be clear and honest I walked in with little to no expectations considering the name and brand have been around for so long. We opted for the Omakase for $125 per person which came up to about 161 after tax and tips. 

When we got the first course we were left underwhelmed thinking the portions were going to be consistently this small. We were wrong. Having this mentality made the experience of dining here so much better as we thought we were going to be leave the restaurant hungry and wanting more. 

The service given to our table was amazing as very single course was explained in detail and dishes were brought out to the speed of our table, nothing was ever rushed and or unexplained. Waters were never empty, and dirty dishes were always taken cared of.

Yes...when you look at the prices on the menu you get shocked. Well...my advise is that if you really wanna try this place ... set a price in your mind, communicate it to your waiter when you arrive and enjoy the experience.

- Tuna belly sashimi beautiful: explosion of flavours 
- Salmon belly: awesome....not as diverse and tasty as the tuna but still great

- Shrimp tempura: ok and filling but not a special experience...you can find it easy anywhere in other sushi spots. 
- The sushi Platter, assorted sushi very fresh but again nothing special.
- The Dessert was very presentable and with great flavour but something that you can easily skip if you are not a fan of sweets. You'll not be missing much.
- To note that the drinks are highly expensive and nothing special.

OFF THE BAT

The two most DELICIOUS bites on the menu is. TORO (OTORO? = Fattiest part of the Tuna) Covered in gold flakes, cavier, and truffle. The comparable bite is the WAGYU BEEF. Literally those are the two most delicious things on the menu, and trust me we tried over like 40+ different bites. I say bite because from the picture you can tell everything came in small bites. 

AMAZING WAGYU BEEF. If I remember correctly its from Miyazaki Farms
http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/swxj-AxPnXoD5_a7hVA8jg/o.jpg

Cool Story: Kobe advertise in America is actually Wagyu Cows. There's lots of farms that mixed Wagyu Cows with Angus Cows. Angus Cow Rib meat is very comparable to Japanese Black Wagyu Cows. In Japan Kobe Beef are just Wagyu Cows and Kobe, Matsuzaka, and Ohmi. 

Nobu sells it by the oz and its 38 dollars per oz. In LA its around 30 dollars for 2 oz in most restaurants. At the grocery market it varies from 3-6 dollars per oz depending on cut. 

Possibly the best Toro I have ever had
http://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JM_eSP6vsBuYRgTIVKs2kQ/o.jpg

Very Very Comparable to the one I had in Japan at 5AM caught that day. 

If you get it A la cart I think its around 28-48 and its definitely worth a try.

Coming in 3rd place for OUSHI UMAMI (Taste and flavor) would have to be the Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi.

2 x Omakase
Signature (By Chef Nobu and its the same everywhere) (125$ Here )
Chef's Omakase (Head Chef's own menu tasting) (175$)

Prices are Post Tax add 50 for Tip

The rest of the meal was okay. Of the meal I think the only low quality fish was the Big Eye Tuna from Hawaii that was still fishy. The Aji (Jack Fish) was tasty and the Salmon was amazing.  

There is a huge Variation of fish. From Steel Head Trout that looks similar to Salmon but much more lean (and chewy) to Black Cod sashimi and Fluke. A lot of the reviews mentioned the Miso Glazed Black Cod - For me it was too much flavor, like too salty. It looked pretty though. The Miso Black Cod part o the Nobu Signature Omakase however the fish for the Signature Omakase which I believe was Umami Sea Bass was MUCH MUCH Better. It wasn't too salty and cooked perfectly. 

Note: My meal was not de-boned correctly

Here's a picture of the fish bone they said was a bamboo from the chopsticks
http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GFMwo0PKZNpCd6ndk6-EXw/o.jpg
You can see there's still meat on the bone!

Manager Silva was a little patronizing but he did remove 50 dollars off the meal for the fish bone. (Mentioned EMT because the fish bone I chomped on punctured my mouth) - Makes sense right? I try to eat sushi the way it was meant to be eaten, 1 bite and I chomped on it. He offered a free bottle of Champagne which I did decline which is a super nice gesture. Although I totally understand his situation as he wants to crowd control their high standards. 

Interesting Note: The group next to us ordered like 6 California Rolls. 

Ending Notes:
For 350$ You kind of expect there not to be fish bones in your sushi. Service by Jay was spectacular. He was very attentive and accommodating. Food Servers really explained the dishes well. The Variety is nice and overall the experience is a good one. 

P.S. The Hostess was a TOTAL Bitch. Reservation was for 6pm and I tried to be seated at 5:45 and she made up some B.S. lie that she cannot sit me because her employees aren't in until 6. I would understand if it was busy at that time but it wasn't. But that's not why she's a bitch, just the overall interaction was very rude. 

PRO ASS TIP: If you want to try a majority of the menu, get both Omakase because you literally get to taste like everything worth trying.",QnO9I7wLQzmUtM865H-tCw,9,2,3,r1GCAH8aNXXOqWJV0Dp1qw

To be honest, you don't need to waste time anywhere on the menu aside from the page with the fresh fish (nigiri and sashimi).  If you choose to order anything else, I recommend the black cod sliders in butter lettuce cups as well as the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño.

Back to the important stuff...
We got the following nigiri:

Albacore
Aged blue fin tuna (HIGHLY recommend)
Japanese red-eye snapper
Japanese golden-eye snapper
Chu-toro
O-toro
Sweet shrimp (with the fried head... be brave and do it... it is delicious!  Make sure you bite off all of the spikes first or you will cut your mouth!)
Yellow tail
Yellow tail belly
Mackerel
Scallop


Service was excellent.  Sit at the bar for a show.  Sushi chefs made it all the more better and are masters at their craft.

I suppose for that, they're okay, but they're not so creative that it blows my mind, although it certainly blew my wallet. 

I didn't feel great value eating here, I didn't feel like they had fantastic service, or were amazingly impressionable. Or personable. Or anything really. I just felt like I went to an expensive restaurant to eat a meal. This is actually a far cry from my experiences elsewhere on the strip. Yes money is the reigning king in Vegas, but it doesn't mean you can get away with just anything if you have a name.

I would pretty much pass, because it's kind of just a fancy, to be seen place. Not really great for food, drinks, or if you want to have a good time.",EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA,11,7,3,ji14CmMqJfELvtMo4RIewA

Yellow-tail with hot peppers cilantro with sauce, this was combination was so amazing.

Sushi-spicy Tuna roll with avocado. The best sushi roll.

Sake paired excellent with the whole meal.

I looked at a lot of reviews and pictures before going and it didn't look very filling so we ordered 2 of the yellowtail sashimi appetizers and were planning on ordering more food after we finished the omakase. Man were we wrong! We were stuffed and all of us can eat a lot too! So unfortunately we did not order anything else after the omakase. I don't remember the names of most of the dishes but most of them were good. We didn't really care for the shrimp dish. It was just okay, nothing special. The miso cod was good but very salty. The beef was very tender, even the well done ends were very tender and seasoned perfectly. 
If I had to pick my top 3 favorite dishes, they would be our 2nd course (the radish wrap, surprisingly very flavorful), the toro with caviar on top, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño. The yellowtail just melts in your mouth and has good flavor. The toro with caviar tasted a little weird to me at first, but after my first bite it was really good. We were stuffed by the end of the courses and then we got a bowl of miso soup. That filled us even more and to top it off, we got a bento box dessert of chocolate molten lava cake with fruit and green tea ice cream. I usually don't order desserts at restaurants since I don't like sweets but this was the perfect sweetness, not too sweet. 

The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because of their service. I don't remember our server's name, but he took a good 15 min before he came to take our drink orders. Then another 15 min to take our food orders. We're all in college so maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him well? Not sure. But we still left a good tip. He had a big smile when he saw it. Our waters were not filled as often as we wanted. My friends with soft drinks got them refilled when they still had half a cup remaining...also the food was a 4/5 for us. There was too much ponzu sauce or whatever it is they use. It was overpowering on almost all the sushi dishes. I like to taste the unique flavor of different fish. Also, we wanted all sushi dishes but that wasn't allowed according to our waiter. Next time we would probably order just sushi a la carte since we don't want any hot dishes. But we probably wouldn't go back for the price we paid. You can get sushi that's just as good or even better for a lot less off the strip.",w4hU4EfwOJqoOrCa19LjGQ,0,0,3,K94HOCiRN_S_BU8rK28Q3g

They have regular edamame or the more fun and tasty kind which is tossed in a slightly spicy curry sauce topped with crushed peanuts. Get the fun kind. The nobu style tacos are little bites of heaven which you will dream about. They are only a bite size taco-literally one bite-but they will change your tastebuds lives. We tried the raw tuna, lobster and crab ones. So fresh. So good. Uhhh so gooood. The black cod was another dish worth mentioning, cooked to perfection with a sweet glaze. Some tasty sushi rolls included the spicy tuna, and both yellowtail rolls, one with scallions another with jalepeno-little kick but yum!!

The service is attentive as you would expect at a high end sushi restaurant.

We did the chef tasting menu. Each course was brought out like it was an act in a theatrical production. The plating was masterful. Some of the standouts include the sushi, sashimi and black cod. The sushi and sashimi were fresh a beautifully crafted. The black cod miso that is marinated and broiled melts in your mouth. Make sure you leave room for dessert.

My husband and I tried the Nobu style tacos (chicken and vegetable respectively), I got the vegetable skewers (kushiyaki) and the tofu toban-yaki, and my husband got the free range chicken dish with the spicy sauce (can't recall what it was called). He tried a midrange sake recommended by our waiter, and I got a glass of the plum wine. I was 100% happy with everything I ordered, except the skewers. They were 50% onion. (I don't know about you, but I don't eat big hunks of onion on their own.) That being said....the eggplant was delicious and the Peruvian corn on the side was very good. The tofu toban-yaki was amazing! Delicious broth and plenty of tofu to fill me up. We were too full to try some sushi or dessert afterward. I'd probably go back, but maybe with a big group and be more willing to really splurge on a variety of things. Just a tip--they tell you that they serve food in a certain style so that you can try everything together, but that doesn't work if you eat different foods as we do. In hindsight I would have asked them to bring food out together in courses. And a warning--I'm sure it's great fun to let them design a menu for you, but it's also probably VERY expensive! :)",S6cz25GMphB3QdpfCqOopQ,0,0,4,mlhoZtCDs8KUOLpak9Yh_Q

The quality of the food isn't bad, but it sure isn't on par with a Sasabune or Sushi-Zo. And there's nothing innovative about the menu at all that you cant get from most other japanese restaurants, so quality is really a big weighing factor here!

I get that there's a certain premium that you're expected to pay to dine at a prime location in Caesars, but they are literally bending you over the table, pulling down your pants, and....well, you get the idea.

The service was pretty good, so if you are looking to have dinner in a nice, upscale restaurant, and don't mind paying exorbitantly for decent food, then by all means this would be a respectable choice.

The ambiance is relaxing. The lighting is dim without being too dark. I'm always impressed with how quiet it is even when it's really busy. It's refreshing to not have to yell across the table to have a conversation. 

The food of course is to die for. Every dish is a work of art. As a photographer and visual person, I tend to eat with my eyes first. I usually get the same thing each time but occasionally branch out and try something new. 

If you can't decide what you want it's always fun to let the chef choose for you. Just tell them the types of sushi you usually gravitate towards and they bring you a feast! 

I recommend the White Fish Tiradito. The sauce is tangy with a little bit of a kick! Also try the Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna. The presentation is genius.

The vegetarian fare was far from flavorful.
Tobanyaki tofu was basically strips of tofu (unfried) in what looked like butter and soy sauce (was on the edge of being fat-grossed out).
Todu itself having no flavor, the dish was unimaginative to say the least.

The vegetarian sushi was tasteless, textureless. Maybe i am not a sushi connoisseur but local stores, whole foods, trader joes, have better tasting veggie sushi.

Kushiyaki with vegetables with a peruvian or chilean i cant remember was very good. Finally something with flavor.

As i have come to notice, nonindian chefs dont understand vegetarian foods are not like meat, seafood where the meats have their own flavors and spicing them actually detracts from intended flavors. Vegetables really need additional help with spices. Even some salt in the sushi would have made it better.

It is a dimly lit place where you struggle to read the menu. And all of the above nearly rocked $60.

I had the black miso cod and the pork belly skewers.  Every single bite completely melts in your mouth. In a single word... Umami.

2696920,2013-03-05,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I'm speechless. Ironically, I have so much to say about this delightful restaurant. This is not Japanese food. Nor is it Peruvian food. Nobu is a cuisine all on its own.

Billy, our server, did a phenomenal job explaining the menu with useful information about anything from the exclusive sake one can only find at Nobu or the freshly juiced cucumbers for the pepino cocktail to the specially crafted plateware and utensils designed specifically for Nobu. He was friendly and trustworthy...which is good because we let him choose our menu.

I won't list everything we ordered (which is A LOT), but I do want to highlight the stars of the show:

- New Style Salmon Sashimi: perfectly fresh, expertly sliced salmon, dusted with sesame seeds, thin julienne of ginger, and splashed with yuzu soy. And then...wait for it....doused with a mixture of hot sesame and extra virgin olive oils. Wow. Just wow.

- Blue Fin Oh Toro Tartare with Golden Osetra caviar: Need I say more? The finest part (the belly) of the finest tuna money can buy topped with decadent, salty sturgeon roe. This is all set in a stringent wasabi-soy vinaigrette (which was so good that I slurped it up after the tuna was gone).

- Black Cod Lettuce Wraps: We also ordered the famous Black Cod Miso which was, of course, melt-in-your-mouth divine. But the manager also brought this interpretation out for us to try. I must say that THIS preparation is the way to go for such a richly fatty dish. The light herbal freshness of the butter lettuce mellows the unctuous richness of the almost stew-like texture of the fish. The thin slices of ginger cuts through the sweet-saltiness of the miso. I can't say enough about this preparation.

- Japanese A5 Wagyu: Cooked on hot stones table side, flambeed with brandy, served with a cracked pepper teriyaki and some seasonal roasted vegetables. I really don't need to say anything else about it. It's true Wagyu: the best beef you can find. Fatty, flavorful, rich. Chef Nobu's genius shines through again by serving it with such an impishly simple, yet perfectly balanced sauce. The veggies were perfectly cooked and delicious as well. Also, the rocks are placed on a bed of kosher salt. I like to take some of that and sprinkle it on the meat for a little added texture and seasoning.

- Tempura shrimp roll: simple and perfect. The rice was balanced, chewy and seasoned well. What really stood out in this lovely morsel was the perfectly blanched asparagus: delicate, crunchy and beautiful bright green. I've eaten this roll a thousand times, but never has it been this good.

- Finally, we have gotten to dessert. The shaved ice was light as a cloud and the mango and green tea syrups that were served along side were tart, sweet and succulent. The best part about this dish was the little bites of fruit and mochi hidden beneath the surface. It was the kind of dessert that got better with each bite. The bento box, however....HOLY CRAPOLA! Again, I've eaten molten chocolate cake a zillion times, but this one takes the...well...cake? I'm not usually one to rave (or even care much) about dessert, but I've never eaten anything as delicious as this. This is THE best dessert I have ever eaten. White chocolate sauce, white chocolate shiso syrup, green tea ice cream and whatever those cookie crumbles are holding the ice cream in place worked so unbelievably well together.

I'm tired of writing. I'm sure you're tired of reading. Go to Nobu. Go there now. You won't be disappointed.",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,7,3,5,YHnBmi7R5F1djGiYui4TWg

I've waited tables for several years before going into my profession.  So I know what good and bad service looks like.  This was definitely the POOREST service I have ever experienced in all of my travels.

My boyfriend and I ate here after seeing Elton John.  We did not feel like a large meal and were ordering sushi plates as we went.  The waiter was very impatient when we weren't ready to order the next round when he returned.  He was also impatient when my boyfriend didn't know which drink to get because they were out of the liquor for the cocktail he had picked on the menu.  Now seeing we were not ordering a ton of sushi cause we did not want a large meal, this seemed to tick off our waiter.  The crowning blow was when were low on our drinks and the waiter asked if we wanted another.  We declined.  He then suggested if we ""wanted to share a drink.""  Really douchebag?  Really?  I was caught off guard and could not believe that I was hearing this.  If I was more on my game I would have asked to see a manager right then and there.  After that point the dude is lucky I didn't deck him.

The sushi was very good and interesting but the whole bad service experience from this punk ass snot marred the whole dinner.

With so many restaurant choices in Vegas, do yourself a favor and avoid this one.  Go to Craftsteak instead.

2811363,2015-01-30,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I came to Nobu a few years ago when I was in Vegas. My friend was hungry but I didn't really eat, just had cocktails. He raved about it so I decided to try it on my trip this time. 

It was hopping and insanely noisy but my boyfriend and I got seats at the sushi bar immediately. He just drank scotch which he enjoyed while I had dinner. I got the Layer Cake Shiraz which is one my favorites and it pains me how much of a markup they have on it. It's insane, the pour is short, maybe only 4 oz so they can stretch the bottle and they probably bought it for $8 a bottle and it's $15 a glass. Kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth; I don't mind spending money but come on, that's just sheer greed.

I got the yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer, except it's not really jalapenos. It's serrano peppers and they put too much sauce on the plate. The acidity works well with the fish but since the fish is literally drenched in it, it's overpowering. I got two orders of the salmon belly and two orders of the aji. The salmon belly was awesome. The aji was also good but again, they drenched the nigiri in sauce, so much so that it completely fell apart while I was picking it up to put it in my mouth. I also got the crispy creamy shrimp tempura. It was yummy. 

Finally, for dessert, I got the green tea royale. I almost laughed when it was brought out. It was the smallest dessert I've ever seen. Like it was literally 2 inches by 1 inch, a little tiny piece of cake with a teeny tiny scoop of ice cream. It was also weird, the flavors were odd, bubblegum ice cream with green tea cake. Separately they were good but together....not right. 

The service also left a lot to be desired. Our waiter rarely checked on us and when he did, he seemed condescending, like he really didn't want to wait on us. I definitely wasn't full but I'd had enough. The bill came to $200 for shrimp tempura, four pieces of nigiri, a yellowtail appetizer, wine and scotch.

We have been here before and to other Nobu's and our experience this time was very disappointing. 

We ordered our meal and we know things come out a different times but this was ridiculous.  We received our lobster tacos first and they were amazing.

Please do not expect this to be a sushi bar. This is an insult to the chefs who include sushi as part of an amazing experience. This is advanced food with impressive and unique interpretations of Japanese cuisine. The wonderful staff will enjoy working with you to design a great night.

I had the signature omakase paired with the Nobu Sake flight. Nobu has their own sake breweries. My meal was a sensual experience in the classic sense with a combination of visual and taste experiences beyond description.

My meal included the classics. Hand roll. Sashimi Salad. Yellowtail with jalapeño. Miso glazed Cod. Sizzling Beef tenderloin. But the sum is so much more than the parts. Paired with the top notch Sake, the various courses created a wonderful dinner experience worthy of the steep yet reasonable price.

The only drawbacks are minor. Some casino noise can overpower the occasional tourist group wanting gourmet spicy tuna rolls with their merlot. It takes a long time for dinner too, so plan at least two hours for a relaxed experience.

2880308,2016-06-20,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Finally checked this place off my bucket list this past weekend. I must say, I expected a little bit more from such a notorious restaurant.

Perhaps this is frivolous, but I absolutely could not overlook the details of the interior. The ambience felt a little economical with the honey-comb paper lanterns that hung intrusively above the table space. The longer you stare at them, the more obvious the imperfections of craft comes forth. A little out of place for an upscale sushi restaurant. 

Aside from the surroundings, the food was stellar. Quality ingredients, down to the seaweed which had the most pleasant nutty, briny essence, far more unique than the commercial brands that local sushi restaurants use. 

Offering a wide range of items, the menu spanned from imported wagyu gyoza, ceviche, to meat skewers. Sushi was what tantalized me, therefore I sampled the Sushi Dinner consisting of 8 pieces of sushi and 1 tuna maki. The tuna was definitely revelational. I've never had tuna that had the taste and texture like the variety at Nobu. I've distanced myself from commercial tuna from as long as I remember due to the chalky and chewy texture, but at Nobu, the tuna tasted like a different species altogether--a must try!

I was a little confused by the salmon, which had a floundering texture, dissolving instead of melting in my mouth. It contrasted with what I was expecting and kind of threw me off guard, a bit yucky to be honest.

The rest of my platter was as expected. I quite enjoyed the octopus nigiri, which was soy-sauced and sprinkled with sesame. It had a satisfying bouncy texture and tasted balanced with the rice and freshly grated wasabi. Also notable was the mackerel. Unlike the commonly stringy and overly pickled variety found at other establishments, this mackerel was delicate and natural with muted acidity. 

Our table of six had a fabulous dining experience embellished with great service and conversation. If I'm every in Vegas again, I'd definitely stop by again to have another round of sushi!",RB4NNopfuPkG0V6YB_86wA,3,3,4,gVIasagaigTHHTFotK_gqw

There were no lines, the restaurant was quiet, and we had an army of attentive servers doing their patrols to clear empty plates and refill drinks.  The service here is amazing, and when the place is emptier, you can really take your time and appreciate everything without feeling rushed, or crowded.

The hamachi-jalapeno appetizer was fantastic, although a little pricey.  At $30, it's half the price of an entire entree, but I'm glad we got it because it really shows off the skills of the chefs.  The balance of everything was perfect, and after tasting it, we knew our dinner would be great.

I usually do a-la-carte sashimi at sushi restaurants, but here, we decided to let the chef decide for us.  We got the sashimi dinner and the sashimi deluxe dinner.  They brought it out all on the same plate, so it was beautiful all together.  Both dishes were 12-15 pieces, but the deluxe came with better cuts of fish.  We got 3 pieces of Bluefin otoro with ours, but YMMV.  As a sushi snob, I always get fresh wasabi, but it which comes with the deluxe dinner - so make sure you don't order it twice - unless you need extra wasabi.

I had the flour-less chocolate cake and the green tea ice cream, which was called the bento box.  Both were delicious, and recommended by the waiter.  The green tea ice cream was very green-tea-y, which was perfect with the warm chocolate cake.

The only thing that was disappointing was the green tea.  It was very watered down, but you can't knock this place down a star for bad tea.

Do yourself a favor and make sure this is one of your first meals in Vegas.  It'll save you from even looking at buffet sushi later on.  Definitely a must-eat in Vegas.",4WMmcW2WUyOP6XAVYa5ryA,1,1,5,rtQeEhLt1d70xv_2eB27gg

Music loud and beautiful people everywhere(obviously me included) like a night club. The waitress came by, who (I must admit) was also beautiful, decided our menu for us. We told her what we liked and disliked and how much we wanted to spend. $150 for both of us I told her, she had to clarify and say each or for the table.

The 4 dishes came they were all excellently prepared and delicious (yes 4 dishes for $150 including tax and tips). The food runner different for each dish it seems explain exactly what we were eating and how to eat it.

Being self proclaimed foodies, we researched this restaurant, among others, and decided it would be the one. We left after our second course, extremely deflated. Our sake and food was served with such a disconnect, we could not even enjoy it. Food was served without a sake pairing, 10 minutes later sake arrived, with no explanation. Horrible service and experience. We spoke to management, who profusely apologized and offered his card, but then expected us to pay $100 towards our meal. It was horribly insulting.

2949074,2015-12-30,6,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Nobu is actually Peruvian accented Japanese food, so it's Japanese and South American food, and it's meant for sharing. If you come here expecting Japanese food, it is not the place for you then. Peruvian food is actually very similar to Asian fusion food, especially cold and hot small plates, and cold small plates are the beautiful Nobu creations you should really try! 

The ambience was pretty casual and relaxing, got seated at a comfy booth, started off with Badoit sparkling water, lemon drop martini and cold sake. Loved the cold sake container, it kept sake cold the entire time. We decided to go for Omakase, $225 per person. 

Omakase courses: 
Yellowtail jalapeño, spicy tuna crispy rice, salmon carpaccio with white truffles, whole Branzino with white truffles and truffle oil, mackerel sushi spread. 

I guess because we went for higher price range so they made us a lot of truffles. To be honest I am not a big fan of truffles, but they tasted very good still. The whole Branzino was very delicious, just a little small for $125, I had a bigger Branzino for only $50 at a French restaurant the previous night. The mackerel sushi spread was my favorite, a few different kinds of mackerel fish, so fresh and tasty! Guess next time we will ask them to make us sashimi or sushi only! The cold dishes were all so yummy, the presentations were very beautiful too. Chocolate vodka dessert drink was bomb, loved it. The housemade hot sauce was amazing too.

Service was very friendly and attentive, food came out very fast. It was a great dinner, food was so good, but somehow I don't think it was worth over $500 for the two of us. Just keep in mind, try to order hot & cold dishes in both apps & entrees, that's what Nobu restaurants are famous for.

While the restaurant was empty, we were seated at a rear table near the kitchen entrance.  The waiter immediately suggested that he bring out two (2) dishes of his choice as an appetizer without showing us a menu.  I was versed in one of the appetizers from my own research and agreed to it.  Our waiter began by explaining the ""eating experience"" at Nobu insisting that we remove the menus that the restaurant prints and give him a price point so that he could begin the experience.  Having read multiple reviews about the restaurant I was prepared for this tactic and explained that we were not heavy eaters (true) and we preferred to review the menu.  He again suggested that a name a price point so that he could give us an experience, I told him $100/person.  The waiter stated that we could not get the experience for that price, I suggested he show us a menu so that I could choose my own experience.  The waiter returned and took our order, he made two (2) suggestions in lieu of what we wanted.  We took him up on one of his suggestions.  After taking our order, the waiter suggested we order more because he was concerned we would still be hungry.  I informed him that I could make that determination after we ate our meal.  

The food was amazing and artful.  Our waiter lost interest in us after learning that we were not going to give him free reign for an experience.  We shared the shaved ice for desert (it was my birthday and my wife arranged that the chef put a birthday message on the plate).  The shaved ice was just ok.

The message is the food is amazing (5 Star Amazing) but the staff (2 Stars for being rude and pushy) is trained in sale tactics and up selling people (everything the waiter offered was the highest price point in each category).  If you want to enjoy your own experience, take the menu into your own hands.

2969150,2015-11-24,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"This is our first time visiting a Nobu Restaurant.  

I did my research and read a lot of reviews prior to arriving, and really contemplated between order a la carte or going with their omakase. 

The restaurant is pretty big, I wish we were put in a booth, but instead we were put at a round table that seats 4 in the middle.

We decided to order the 175.00 omakase and was told the difference between 125.00 and 175.00 is that 125.00 us based on items on the menu already.  The 175.00 one are items created by the chef that are not on the menu.  

First course was king mackerel with sweet potato chip, fried shiso leaf, ginger ponzu sauce. 

Next was sashimi salad with barracuda, Bonito tuna, amberjack (this one was soooo good), wrapped Japanese Daikon and greens with Nobu vinaigrette. Everything was so fresh, and the sauce was perfect.
The little fried crab was super cute.  It tasted like crab chips but had the texture like chewing on eggshells. 

Next Nigiri, blue fin tuna, butterfish, trout, uni and egg. All were superb in their own sauce.  Didn't need soya sauce. 

Next sashimi, 2 piece of blue fin Toro belly (melted in your mouth) with caviar and 14 karat gold shavings.  Tako live octopus with rare Japanese mushroom with sesame oil. 

Next was a course that needed our presentation.  It was a Himalayan salt block with fresh yuzu and 3 pieces of sashimi.  Was supposed to squeeze the yuzu onto the salt block and run the sashimi over the block a couple of times before eating.. I found it to be too salty, I didn't enjoy this course too much, it tasted better with just yuzu. 

Next was Chilean sea bass with Bonito flakes and pressed rapini.  At this time I was getting pretty full already.  The fish was cooked perfectly and had a nice taste. It was in a ponzu sauce again, but went well with the fish. 

Next was seared A5 wagyu beef with fried gnocchi.  The beef honestly melted in your mouth like the fatty Toro belly.  There were 5 pieces cooked medium rare and was really good.  

Then it was an avocado chilled miss soup with king crab and tobiko.  This was very interesting, came in a small cappuccino cup as presentation, the tobiko added a nice texture and crunch to the soup, and when biting down on the tobiko, there was a sour explosion.  It was very nice. 

Lastly dessert was Chai ice cream, blood orange Panna Cota, soya form, marinated Japanese pumpkin and shortbread. The ice cream was so good along with the short bread and soya foam.  The Japanese pumpkin was really sour and didn't really go with the dish. 

Overall it was a great experience.  Got to try many different dishes, the service was great!",4hetE9pQKPXesVF4KB2c8A,3,1,5,L6zlnzSHab9eLmP2NToJEA

Secondly, 38 dollars an ounce at Nobu with a minimum of two ounces is flat out highway robbery. I have absolutely zero issue paying for a dish where I believe the quality matches the price. The wagyu beef is just simply not that great. Also, it's dripping in this sauce that Nobu douses so many of their beautiful fish offerings with. I was really disappointed in the ""New Style Wagyu"" dish. Just don't get it. Trust me!

Other than that, some hits that I was pleasantly surprised with the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the toro collar. We also had the black cod miso which my guy deems the best fish we had in Vegas. We ordered sweet shrimp and uni since it's our standard way of seeing how legit or non-legit a place is. It turned out to be pretty decent, but we've had better. I don't know that I'll be visiting this place again, but it was a good experience, to say the least!

On the corner in front of Bally's are impersonators...Zach Galfanikis holding a baby, Gene Simmons in his Kiss getup, and a life-sized Hello Kitty. I want to punch them all.
All hope is gone. 
I need an 18 year old, some vicodin, and respite from this madness.
Eighteen year-old Scotch, that is. 

I wander over to Caeser's sports book to kill time before the Preakness, but the glassware people are everywhere. I duck into the nearest restaurant hoping to find solace from these curious assholes.
And there it was.
A sanctuary in the midst of it all...Nobu's at Ceaser's.

The server was a nice young man who resembled that creepy shit from American Pie...the one desperate to abduct Tara Reid's panties on prom night. 
That's all I kept thinking about throughout lunch. 
My prom. 
Well, that and Becky Deluca's sudden onset of virtue, not Tara's panties.

Five Asahi drafts and one ceviche later, I was prepared to face the madness once again. The bill was close to a Franklin, but I wasn't bothered. The ceviche was a visual extravaganza, its flavor and texture even better. The draft Asahi was nothing short of nectar, a gift from the barley gods. And the server? While creeping me out, he was more attentive than a black man at a Klan rally.

Becky must be in her mid forties by now. Probably wearing those giant, white cotton panties and mom jeans. I bet she and her husband sport colored glassware when they hit the mean streets of Vegas.

Nobu's Ceaser helped me find center when I needed it most.
Mylute paid $5.20 to show. I had $200 across the board on him.
Be wary of the bong people when in Vegas.

First let me start by saying I found my most favorite drink ever - which was the cucumber martini with lychee juice and grapefruit vodka.  It was so light and refreshing w a hint of sweetness.  I can't wait to try making it at home.

We ordered a bunch of cold plates to start - cucumber salad, artichoke salad, yellowfin sashimi, crab cerviche and spicy edamames.  All delicious!!  

Then we had the spicy chicken skewers and the rock shrimp.  The shrimp dish was my favorite. 

We ordered three desserts including the chocolate donuts and the bento box.  They were amazing but I wish they were bigger bc we all wanted more.

3048707,2016-06-08,2,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Overall great experience, emphasis on the experience.  Menu is $$$$ so be prepared to drop some coin.  The ambiance is loud - even for a casino.  I wasn't completely impressed with the food, especially for the price point.  

Appetizers:
Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar ($48) - The boyfriend absolutely loved this.  It was his favorite part of the meal.  I'm not a fan of caviar, so I wasn't a fan of the appetizer, naturally.

Nobu Style Tacos ($6 - $14, minimum 2) -  We chose tuna & king crab.  The tacos are about the size of an egg, but the tuna taco was AMAZING.  I could have ordered a dozen.

Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Tosazu ($28) - Nothing special.  Same tuna tataki as every other sushi joint.

Hearts of Palm salad ($24) - This was refreshing.  You don't see hearts of palm much on menus, and it was a great starter to the meal.

At this point, I saw a table of 9 being seated behind us in our waiters section, and I had a feeling the service might decline.  I was right. :-/

Some tables around us ordered a dish that was lit on fire when served, and I had to know what it was.  Our server explained it was the Wagyu grilled steak, the most sought after beef in the world.  Priced $38/oz, with a minimum 6oz order ($228).  I HAD to try it, and with reassurance from the boyfriend, the waiter placed my order.  (Side note on the gender bias... Is it such a crazy concept that I was paying for the meal?  Why did he need the male approval??)  The presentation was spectacular.  The steak is brought out on 3 hot stones & they light it on fire table side.  Quite a show!  Hands down best steak I have ever had.  (All 3 bites of it!)  

The waiter said Nobu isn't known for their sushi, but that it is excellent.  We decided to make this our main course.

Yellowtail and Jalapeno cut roll ($12) - I thought this was excellent.  VERY spicy!  The boyfriend absolutely detests cilantro & at the beginning of the meal, the waiter specifically asked if we had any allergies or dislikes.  We mentioned the cilantro, and he assured us our meal would be cilantro-free.  Not the case with this roll unfortunately.  I don't know why he would ask if he wasn't going to follow through.

Toro (Blue Fin) and Scallion cut roll ($16) - Nothing special, just a normal sushi roll.

Tuna (Big Eye) with avocado cut roll ($12) - Again, nothing special.  Just another roll.

We also ordered 1 piece of sashimi that wasn't on the menu the waiter recommended.  It was a slice of Blue Fin that is aged 14 days in an air tight, refrigerated cedar box.  The waiter forgot to order it, so we had to remind him after all the other rolls had come & gone.  Again, nothing special, just another piece of sashimi.  ($14)

Overall, the food was average.  Certainly not what I was expecting for a $500 meal.  (Even for Vegas)  The service really wasn't up to par for an upscale restaurant either.  I am thankful for the experience, but we most likely will not return.  We'll try something new next time instead.",60_lsQJ8JEGfZeXcTgKn8Q,2,0,3,CYj-DIEijd6UwnwJmvKYSQ

He was told that they did not have a vegan menu, but options so we were a bit hesitant to go. Who wants to pay top dollar for sub standard options? They exceeded our expectations. The server, Leopoldo was more than helpful. He pointed out everything that was vegan on the menu and told us of options that we could veganize. He was also very careful at asking specially what our dietary needs were and how strict we were when we said vegan. Despite being busy, he made sure to come over and check on us and even stopped to chat. We decided on the mushroom toban-yaki which had varieties of mushrooms I hadn't even seen before, roasted vegetables that came with 3 interesting and delicious dipping sauces, and two veggie rolls; one with everything including okra and an avocado and asparagus roll.

I'm not a big fan of Caesars but I was ready to stay here to stay at the Nobu hotel. Only problem was whether intentional or not the reservation agent on the phone pretty much talked me out of it. However, I still absolutely had to dine at the restaurant. 

Love this place and the food is amazing at every location, no matter what you order but this one loses a star bc the bartender, although really nice was very aggressive about trying to get me to spend more money than I had hoped too. 

First he mentions all these specials not on the menu and when I said I would try 1 he said it's either $80 or $120 depending on how I want it prepared. I guess I should be flattered that I looked so wealthy to him but it really was obnoxious. 

After that anything I ordered or that he suggested I had to ask the price of and he still was dishonest with some house special roll that was supposed to be $30 something and on my check, which I didn't look at carefully until after I left I was charged $40 something. 

He also made me a drink I didn't like bc he didn't want me to start with the drink I wanted too and charged me for the drink I didn't like or drink???

They were out of ingredients for 3 drinks I tried to order and basically for this level restaurant I was very disappointed with the service and selection. 

I had to ask for a glass of water 3 times before getting it and for spending about $200, by myself I was not so impressed with the service I received. However I love Nobu so I'm sure I will be back anyway.",xEXQBoPjAoYYj9xdPx7nEA,0,0,4,tl9HlY7j8R7OztPzCYyO_g

So the ambience is quite lovely.  Dark and with beautiful lanterns.  It is a fusion of a modern and classy restaurant with Japanese influence.

I had the yellowtail sashimi...which is amazing!  I would definitely order it again. It's a must try signature disk by Nobu.  I also ordered prawn tempura, which was good but it only had two pieces.  I finished off with an avocado and cucumber roll. Which were good, but not worth the price.  Everything was a little over priced...but you're paying for the experience and ambience.

My waiter was very informative and professional but right off the bat he tried to get me to order a sampling menu, which is not what I was interested in.  So I cut him off and asked if i could order off the menu...which of course I  could.

So overall, unless you are sushi lover like myself, you may not want to spend money on Nobu.  I'm all about good food and the experience, so I was satisfied.

I would probably go back, but I'll probably go to the one in Malibu.

After discovering I was ordering sushi anyways, the waiter kept asking, ""do you even know what that is?"" each time I mentioned a sushi roll (uhhh, yes. I've eaten sushi more times than I can count). My friend just wanted to order a normal entree as well since neither of us were overly hungry and we had tickets to a show and didn't have time to eat a meal with several courses. 

When he discovered we wouldn't be spending $300+ on dinner, our waiter showed obvious disgust and barely came back to check on our table. We had each ordered a cocktail and were not even asked if we would have liked a second cocktail. 

The sushi I had was pretty good, but to be honest, I had better sushi other places while in Vegas. My friend had some kind of meat skewers, which he said were good, but were very tiny. Due to how mean our waiter was, he opted not to order extra and just got a  sandwich somewhere else afterwards, which was ridiculous after spending $120. 

I was so excited about this place, but the illusion is now over. I won't be back. Nobu, please look into training your staff. The service we received for this level of restaurant was atrocious.",-hYYjAXSAa657rY0ANtTGQ,15,1,2,R_F8nvyq3IB34qHu0umFzQ

3261059,2018-05-12,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Nobu gets two stars-naw never-mind, one-because it's not disgusting low standard sushi, but not the highest quality fish flown in from Tsukiji Market, Tokyo, Japan. 

The sushi rice is lightly seasoned with rice vinegar and sugar; the flavor is almost nonexistent. At any moment there are between 7-10 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar that are all wearing plastic gloves are they make their nigiri & rolls... Some of their fish is pre-cut, and not only for the rolls, but the nigiri as well. 

I asked who was the head sushi chef, and the waitress sat me in front of him; I forgot his name which mirrors how unmemorable my sushi eating experience was. He asked me what I wanted; I asked if he had an omakase  nigiri option, and he said no. I asked him if there was a tokujo: highest-ranked Sushi tuna option, and he didn't express that he knew what I was talking about. I asked him if he seasoned the nigiri ala Jiro & other high end Master sushi chefs, and he told me to just use the wasabi and mix it with the, ""soy sauce."" I couldn't help but laugh out loud. I understand that most places you do season your own nigiri & rolls if you're into rolls with wasabi & shoyu, but Nobu is claiming that it's a high end authentic sushi restaurant and it is not. 

The chefs are absolutely not formally trained under a lineage of Master sushi chefs. Their knives look somewhat average quality, as their steel is not strategically assigned to only fish, and only rolls & produce i.e. they were not switching knives for each tasks with their plastic gloves hands-like they absolutely do at authentic sushi bars. 

I ordered the aged bluefin, anago, hotate, salmon belly & uni from Japan instead of the premium nigiri option because unlike omakase at my favorite sushi restaurant Sanraku in San Jose, I completely did not trust this plastic glove wearing sushi chef who the hostess said did not with the rest of the sushi making staff have formal training in Japan. 

The tuna was sparsely sliced, and wasn't the highest quality. The hotate was definitely not from Japan and lacked sweetness and flavor; I seriously think it is from Costco because I buy scallops from there all the time and it tastes identical. The salmon belly was good; farmed but not bad. The anago was very disappointing, try and way overly seasoned with teriyaki sauce; sad to say it tastes like unagi and not authentic Japanese anago nigiri. At this point I told the guy to forget about the uni from Japan; he just smirked and said, ""next time..."" There won't be a next time...

I purposely didn't write about price as I don't like my reviews to be skewed or influenced by price-as I want them to be merited on taste & deliciousness or lack thereof only. But, I must say-the price is absolutely ridiculous! And, if I factored the price of this ignoramus stupid sushi in the star would be in the negatives. I usually go hard & fat when I tip-if even with a bad experience because you never mess with people who serve you food-food for thought... But, I tipped as scarcely as the cuts of fish that were placed on the tasteless sushi rice was served to me... I'll never go back to Nobu because I don't respect liars & imposters! I have more respect for a Chinese or Korean owned all you can eat sushi spot trying to come up because these folks work hard, and don't get the respect that they deserve. The people at Nobu are trying to prevent that they're something that they are not. They are the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu version of being fake Black Belts. Totally dishonorable fake imposters with mediocre low quality sushi that will fool ignoramus drunk Las Vegas gamblers. People from Japan would never eat here! And Nobu's wasabi is cheap green pasty shit and their ginger is average if Nobu was a sushi buffet. Last time I was at Sanraku in San Jose, CA the WHOLE sushi bar was filled with Japanese speaking people-except me as I'm Sansei & Hafu. The Japanese lady sitting next to me told me not to tell anyone, and to keep Sanraku a secret. These customers would completely frown on Nobu! I was honestly & sincerely hoping for a grand sushi eating experience being that I was in Las Vegas and do not gamble or drink, but Nobu shot me in the feet as my palate is in recovery that I hope is not permanent i.e. You're better off eating buffet style sushi than Nabu while in Las Vegas; Nobu Sushi is a ginormous ignoramus mistake...",wWTgTwTw-jE_VQ4i_yyGyA,0,0,1,qamh0C9W0Y_lOrHUT4K2DA

Compared to hotels, this is the W of sushi restaurants - super hip, ambiance is amazing, food is ok. We dined on a Sun. night, and the restaurant was packed. Our server was knowledgeable and professional, but forgot a couple requests/orders throughout the meal.  Also, servers need to understand how to cater to authentic Asian palettes - every suggestion our server made was really Americanized, we didn't like anything we got based on his suggestions.

We started with some apps:
- Famed jalapeno yellowtail (yellowtail was great, the jalapeno was not spicy at all)
- Rock shrimp tempura (we only got this at the suggestion of our server as the 'best tempura' choice. We originally wanted to order shrimp + veggie tempura.  This is NOT tempura.  It's basically bang bang shrimp)
- Chutoro carpaccio (off menu item suggested by server. Pretty good flavors throughout. Capers, truffle oil, etc.)

Main:
- Sashimi: yellowtail, yellowtail belly, oh toro, clam, red snapper, uni, salmon belly (bellys were very good, uni super fresh. Have had better oh toro for sure. Most were fresh, clam was flat out disgusting)
- Rolls: house roll + soft shell crab roll (both very good. They wrap their rolls in a very thin layer of radish - nice concept. Gives a little more contrast in bite)

Dessert:
- Bento box (probably best part of the meal. Matcha ice cream is very matcha!)

Drinks:
- 10-year sake (decent)
- White wine (basic)
- Old Fashioned (at suggestion of server, really wasn't that great. Should have just gotten straight whisky)

Located in Cesar's Palace, this Nobu is the largest!  Ambiance is nice.  Dimmed lights, very romantic.

Everyone that we had encountered was kind & attentive to our needs.  Our server, Tyler, was top notch & we ordered everything that he recommended!

Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño:  So fresh!  No soy sauce needed, just the sauce it comes marinated in is all you need.  Instead of ginger, they provide cilantro as a means to cleanse the palette.  Very neat. 
Salmon Sushi (1):  Fantastic!
Salmon Belly Sushi (1):  Seriously, the only sushi in the desert I will ever eat.
Black Cod Miso:  A must order!  I repeat, a must order!  Move over Chilean Sea Bass, you have met your match.  The cod is marinated so perfectly, the sauce is sweet.  & it cut like butter into perfect thin slices.  I tried to take as little bites as I could to savor the goodness & literally wanted to cry when it was gone.  If I could do it again, I would order 2 more.
Hamachi Kama:  This was supposed to be an appetizer size but because of the size, it was a meal.  Delicious!

As most reviews have mentioned over and over, the black miso cod and lobster roll can't be missed. The flavors are just so so good. I will add that we tried the sea bass skewers, and filet and both were excellent as well. 
If your feeling adventurous this is the place to do it as far as sushi goes. It is fresh and delicious and the variety we tried this time around left us full yet we managed to finish it all. 6 different rolls and all were exceptional. 
For those who are undecided and want to try a little of everything there is several tasting menus to choose from, but if that's too much, tell your server your preferences and they will direct you to the perfect sashimi nigiri or sushi. Chefs specials we ordered were also impressive!

That being said, we've never had Miso Black Cod executed nearly as well - Nobu managed to keep it incredibly moist and not overly sweet. It was the best miso black cod that I've ever tried.

We both opted for the Bento Box ($55) during lunch, so that we could try a smattering of his menu to compare to what we make at home. Each dish exceeded our home versions by a mile, it was a great experience to see the stark improvement in quality and it made the rather pricey bento box worthwhile.

Dessert was mochi but they were frozen hard like ice hockey pucks and required some serious effort to cut. The flavors were okay though. 

Service was pretty good.

Other Nobus, they let you savor everything and encourage you to take your time which enhances the experience...at this one, I just felt rushed. And did I mention jammed in like a sardine? (Although those would not be welcome at such a swanky place) 

Another annoyance: every. single. recommendation the waiter made was literally some of the most of expensive items on the menu (like...2-3x the price of the average). I mean, if I go to Nobu I expect to light some money on fire but if I followed his recommendations, it would have been $300 a person before cocktails. *smh*

We made a reservation for 7:45, and arrived a bit early, but luckily scored seats at the bar to sit and soak in the Nobu ambiance prior to arriving at our table. We all settled on the rosé ($15/glass), and hung out at the bar until the hostess came over to bring us to our table. 

Everything about Nobu is sexy - the pods with couches, the low lighting, the tables that are a bit low to the ground.. it's just a beautiful and completely sensory experience. 

Everything at Nobu is designed to be shared, if you aren't as greedy as we were and decide to opt for that. We decided to order a cold dish, hot dish, and sushi rolls to share, and then each order an entree. 

You can also select Omakase, if so desired, which is always a nice option to have when you're indecisive. 

We started with the famous, and according to our server, most popular Nobu cold dish, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno ($29 for 6 pieces). It was the perfect start to the meal, and I honestly feel like I could have eaten an entire plate of it. It was so clean, so fresh, and the jalapeno/sauce on the plate combo was perfection. They'll also allow you to order a few extra pieces depending on the size of your party, so that each person can get two pieces (or they recommend order an additional order of it). Honestly, this is what I will dream of when I picture food heaven. 

We also ordered a spicy cauliflower with jalapeno dressing, and then sushi rolls (spicy tuna, yellowtail and jalapeno, and shrimp tempura). All came out at different times and were delivered to the center of our table, and all were devoured almost instantly. The cauliflower was the perfect level of spicy, and the sushi was deliciously fresh and rolled beautifully. 

For an entree, I ordered the scallops with wasabi pepper, and my colleagues each ordered a different dish as well, so if we wanted to try something new, it was available to us. The scallops were perfection - cooked beautifully, surrounded by a ton of delicious vegetables, and the most gorgeous level of spice. Seriously, it's 9 AM EST right now, and I'm dreaming of this amazing dinner.

Food: 4, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 3
Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (didn't find quality to be miles above other Japanese restaurants to warrant the pricing)
Return worthiness: maybe
Eve award: best fancified shave ice

Highlights:
- Big portions: expected tiny plates for the tasting menu, but the portions were really large. Started with 3 huge pieces of white tuna 
- Shaved ice: huge mound of airy shaved ice with fruit, jellies, mochi and tofu ice cream hidden below. Tofu ice cream had a firmer texture that was a nice contrast to the delicate ice above it. 2 sauces were provided to pour over: green tea and passion fruit. Surprisingly the hit of the night 
- Variety of sashimi: 3 different preparations and 6 in the nigiri set
- Decor: loved the modern, lively, open feel to it with bursts of color
- Flourless chocolate cake: I've had a lot of these, and this was an excellent rendition. Warm and melty inside with a bit of a crunchy exterior layer. Appreciated the Asian flair in the bento box presentation and green tea ice cream pairing.
- Not all have to tasting menu: like this as it makes ordering easier especially with the non-seafood eating hub
- Cocktails: fun menu--we tried a few

Midlights:
- Service: hard to catch our waiter 

Lowlights:
- Undercooked miso cod: this is a signature dish, so was very disappointing. It had a gummy texture and didn't flake off like it should.

Had a good meal here but not sure I'd race back.",aD-rsDe2S0e7jTkYD6ULaQ,1,1,4,l-RRS7IxyEeiagLpWf13dg

It started off as a ""minus"" experience because the restaurant misplaced our reservation, despite me walking up to the hostess the previous day and making it in person.  But, they seated us right away in the lounge area, so no harm, no foul.

The ambience was great... the larger-than-expected restaurant had a modern/Japanese vibe.  The service was as to be expected for one of Chef Nobu's restaurants.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and our courses arrived at a perfect pace.

As for the food... it was nothing short of fantastic.  Having not eaten at a Nobu restaurant before, every dish was a treat.  We all opted for the prix fixe menu.  At $125 it was expensive, but Drew only turns 30 once, so what the heck.  There was a good mix of cold and warm dishes, as well as a few non-fish items.  While it was a great overall meal, I doubt I'd pay that much for that meal again.

The food was good. The fish was very high quality. I had the $125 chef special omakase with 6 courses and everything tasted fine. But that's just it. It was ONLY fine and not mind blastingly delicious. It was merely satisfactory and I don't feel the cost was justified. For two of us, it was nearly a $400 dinner including two glasses of wine plus tip. So I expected to walk away like, ""Holy cow! That was more incredible than the Hulk!"" But instead it was more like, ""Ehhhhhh it was good but I wouldn't go again."" 

I don't mind spending money for an amazing and memorable meal. I truly am a person that lives to eat. But I've had omg-so-effing-good-must-serve-at-my-own-wedding food for less than $10 too.

3445083,2013-07-12,2,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"The now 4-6 month new Nobu in CP!! The largest one open in the country.... yay! We landed reservations after our show at the Mirage. Walking around and enjoying the leisure stroll was just perfect before our 10PM dinner.

Impressive!!!! Kind of steals your breath away to see  how Chef Matsuhisa has fashioned his newest restaurant in the Empire (of the Rising Sun.. hehe). My Food&Wine mag arrived last month, and I brought it along with me for reading. His easy teriyaki recipe was being featured, and how perfect that I was now happening upon some awesome fish!!

Salivation commence. It was here I tried harajiki for the first time.

We took the reco of our Japanese server (cutie pie, with Japanese lilt) and ordered as she suggested: the hamachi sashimi with ponzu, jalapeno and cilantro. Heavenly. perfect balance. awesome. 5 or 6 petite slices. $28. we'd do it all over again and get another one (yah, right... only if we had won the jackpot).

Next we moved onto a lightly battered tempura rock shrimp size bowl with a spicy cream sauce over a bed of rocket($24). Though nicely battered and delicate, we didn't care too much for it. Better to have stuck to more raw stuff. Which we didn't...

As our next dish was the famed hamachi kama ($18) Course I did enquire about the MP for the toro kama. OUT! Not in from the fish market (Tsukiji?). so no go (no worries: we both still got to experience our first O Toro in roll form) 

It was SOO DARN GOOD we just kept at it. The flavor... was awesome. Nice deep grill flavor, fish around the collar was super duper tasty, and fresh, firm, yummy. And with fresh young ginger to rinse off the palate in the form of slender pink sticks (harajiki), it was too good.

Then the masterpiece: a complete 6-8 piece cut roll of O Toro ($10).. the mighty blue fin! Did we feel some guilt? yes, we did. But did it melt and just sit like silk on the tongue?!! WHY YES IT DID!

loved the dinner. 
Experience and ambiance a sure hit. Solid, fresh,Japanese food cooked right.

3450073,2018-02-23,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I thoroughly enjoyed a business dinner here with a group of 7 others a few days ago. Once we got to Caesar's Palace, it was a little hard to find, but I hadn't been before and wasn't sure which direction to head in from the lobby. Thankfully, it's located pretty well away from the main gaming areas, so there's less smokiness in the air here. The ambiance is exceptional, and attention to every minor detail has been paid, from the lighting, to the furniture, to the custom-made dinnerware that is breathtaking with such beautiful edible creations on it.

The food was 5 stars, hands down, and some of the best I've had anywhere (especially the sashimi and the Wagyu beef!), but unfortunately, the service left quite a bit to be desired, especially for the fine dining experience that Nobu should be. My co-worker and I arrived a bit late due to a delayed flight, so our business companions had ordered a couple of appetizers to munch on while they waited for us. There were a few bites of edamame and grilled shishito peppers with a sauce (ponzu?). The edamame was standard, but the peppers were pretty tasty. Once we were all together, we decided to go with Omakase for us all -- basically a grouping of chef's selections which highlight popular dishes, and give you a bit of a taste of many dishes. In total, we had about 8 courses. 

My favorites were the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the Wagyu beef. The salmon sashimi was also very good. The yellowtail tasted so fresh and clean with the jalapeno. If I hadn't known how many other courses were coming after this (our first dish), I could have happily eaten this all night. A testament to the quality here: I ate wasabi. Happily. This is a miracle, Yelp friends. The salmon sashimi came with wasabi (real Japanese wasabi, mind you, not the green horseradish served in 90% of sushi restaurants), Chinese mustard, capers, and saffron. It was amazing! Mild horseradish-ness and a bit sweet from the real wasabi. Genius flavor pairing, like many of the dishes here. The Wagyu beef... I kind of have no words. This is real Wagyu beef here, they don't just call it that on the menu, and you can taste the difference. It's served raw on hot stones, which a server then sets aflame to cook the beef to your desired temperature (medium rare for our table). It's served with an Asian dipping sauce, which was tasty, but which I just skipped. The beed melts in your mouth. Literally. It melts. Heaven! And the stones are placed in rock salt on the plate, which gets smoked a bit from the cooking of the beef. Eat some of the salt and thank me later. Wow, what a dish!! Honorable mention goes to the blackened Alaskan cod with miso. It was very tasty as well. Having not been before, the tasting-type menu was certainly the way to go, but next trip in (and there WILL be a next trip), I know *exactly* what I'm ordering.

The only miss here was the service. It wasn't bad perse, but not up to par for a 5 star, fine dining experience. They seem to cover tables in ""teams"" here, with one lead server for the table, then many who drop off food, refill waters, etc. That's all great, when everyone is on the same page. Our dinner service stretched over about 3 hours. During that time, I was able to order only 2 glasses of wine (geez, I sound like a real lush here, huh? I would have liked about 8, but... Lol!). When our server who actually did any of the order-taking (drinks, etc.) would come by, she wouldn't check with everyone if they wanted another cocktail, even if their glass was low (loud restaurant + separate conversations = easy to miss her). Then, the round of drinks that had been ordered took 20-25 minutes to arrive. I assume the bar was backed up, but it seemed like a very long time. Meanwhile, waters weren't refilled and I was thirsty through much of the latter half of the meal. Also, several of our courses came out on top of each other, rather than one following another. There just seemed to be timing issues. Some will think I'm being super nit-picky here, but I don't think this feedback is out of line for the prices at Nobu, nor the expectations of a fine dining establishment. None of this would preclude me from coming back or from recommending Nobu. Overall, dinner was lovely, and if you're in the mood for some delicious Japanese inspired dishes, I think you should head on in!",lXVhRwOT_QfVX8CyJLAyhg,1,2,4,isNisH-c2Z3Nc50BZ1_Qnw

1/2* for the receptionists and a ""server"". The receptionists have great smile. I am not even sure whether he is the serve or not. A guy served us drinks, explained the menu, took away all our dirty dishes except our glasses and helped finding someone to give us check. I assumed he is our serve until .... he couldn't give us check? so who/where our serve is? Is he just a busboy who did all the servers' job?? I'm confused. 

Food? Edible. 
Monkfish - dry and looks like a piece of SPAM that has been sitting in the refrigerator after it was opened.
Caviar - salty only, couldn't find any hint of sea. Eggs weren't firm at all.
Cut roll - it just simply made me speechless. It wasn't even roll or cut professionally.
Black cod miso - looks great! Fish was fresh and really well cooked, but the sauce killed the entire dish. It was so sweet that it took me a glass of water to finish it.

I don't really write reviews but I have to for this one. Ever since we finished eating here, I can't stop thinking about this place. 

This restaurant is interesting and very high end. You can either order straight off the menu or go with the tasting menu where they chose and pick which dish you should try based on your preferences and budget. We spent $80 a person and got to try about 10 items (not sure if this was discounted or not because we had connections). These items are a la carte and are served in very small portions. I loved how they came out with the dish one by one and fully explained what the dish was or how it was cooked, etc. They even served us some dishes that weren't even in the menu. 

Everything I tried was SO delicious. I was never disappointed and no dish was just ""ok"".  However I did have my favorites: yellowtail sashimi, black cod miso, and the truffle spinach salad. I have a favorite sashimi spot in San Diego and Nobu definitely tops it! 

Customer service was excellent! However our server assumed we didn't want dessert because we said we were full. Ambiance, environment, and everything else was beyond excellent as well! 

There has always been a Nobu in San Diego but never been there! I'm definitely going to try it and we'll see if it'll be the same. I'm going to take my fiancé here one day even though he doesn't like sashimi. Maybe Nobu can change his mind!

Everything admittedly was high quality, we went with a group so we tried a little bit of everything.

But don't expect to walk out of here without spending $200+/person. But it's also about the experience. It was my second time here, but this time I was sober :)

Bottom line -- the layers of ingredients was simple but amazing.  We typically eat a light dinner, so we knew we wouldn't break the bank ... but you could if you wanted.  We started with the cucumber salad.  Simple and delicious.  The Wagyu beef tacos were a great way to taste this delicacy.  (A full steak, no matter how good, isn't within our preferred diet.)  Onto the chicken skewers.  This was our ""main"" course.  The chicken was surprisingly fatty, which is a turn-off for me, but the spicy sauce got me through it.  My favorite item were the tempura vegetables.  Perfect.  Lastly, the waiter suggested the Bento Box desert.  A flourless chocolate cake with white chocolate syrup oozing from it, fresh berries and green tea ice cream.  We don't usually have desert right after dinner, but this sounded so outrageous we had to try it.  Had we not had the dessert I would have felt the meal okay.  The dessert put the whole meal into a class of its own.  

Our waiter moved the rating from 3 to 5.  He was one of the best waiters we've ever had.  Not only was Matthew patient with novices, but very knowledgeable and very smooth on suggesting different items (the Bento Box was one he suggested).

The first thing the server asked us was if it was our first time as this is probably on a lot of people bucket list of restaurants to try.  Lastly, if you are hoping to eat before drinking to soak up the alcohol later in the night, this is not the place to waste your money on, unless that's your style. They recommend you to try 3 of the cold appetizers and 3-4 of the hot appetizers before you order sushi, because you do not want to fill-up on rice in the beginning.

The server explained the menu to us and gave us suggestions on recommendations for first-timers. The miso cod was one that we tried, and I would highly recommend all first-timers to try as well. We started off with the yellowtail carpaccio with ponzu sauce, and it was delicious, coming from someone who doesn't eat raw fish. For something fried, we got the wagyu beef and lobster tacos, which were enveloped in fried wontons, not taco shells lol. They were a one-bite type of app. I tried to share it with my boyfriend, but it always ended up on the table, oops. Can't take me anywhere fancy~ 

Next we got the trio of oyster which had a different sauce to each of them. Forgot what it was called, but it was pretty good, we followed that with shrimp tempura which kind of looked like honey walnut prawns, but didn't taste like it. It was bombbb diggity. 

To finish off, we ordered 2 rolls, a spider roll and another roll I forgot, both were really good. They use daikon to wrap the rolls over the seaweed, which is different, but I enjoyed it.

Food was great as always atmosphere was awesome.  I had some sushi rolls and some teriyaki beef my buddy had the Chileign Sea Bass.  The reason for the three stars is because my buddy during dinner went to drink his water and as he went to put the glass to his mouth it shattered in his had not only did a full glass spill on him but he cut the inside of his hand.  Now I'm not about getting a free meal but when your bill is over $180.00 and something like that happens you would think they would at least offer you a free dessert especially cause my buddy cut his had and it was bleeding.  Just didn't seem right I've been to restaurants in the past and have waited longer than normal for a meal and the restaurants have offered a free desert or even taken the meal off the bill.  I just wasn't happy with the situation and kind of killed the excitement for me to go back like I always have when I come to Vegas and that frequently.

3612698,2014-12-30,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Last night, my family and I came here for a family style, Peruvian-Japanese inspired meal. Upon entering the dining area, the staff yelled something in Japanese. The restaurant interior was modern looking, the walls were wavy and the pillow like lights resembled jellyfish. Everyone was given stones to rest their chopsticks on. They only have drink menus with mixed cocktails, Japanese wines, Japanese beers, and Japanese tea. Your job is to tell your waiter/server what you like and what your limitations/restrictions are (e.g., allergies, preferences, budget limit, etc). The waiter/server will talk to the chef to customize dishes.

For sweet and fruity cocktails, I'd recommend the Mango and Passion Cocktail. I could barely taste or feel the alcohol in this drink. 

The dishes we received,

1. Six pieces of yellowtail sashimi topped with a jalapeño in ponzu sauce laid out like flower petals and the bud made out of a pile of parsley topped with a carrot shaving.

2. Six pieces of snapper sashimi topped with dry miso rub, garlic chips, and chives, in lemon juice-extra virgin olive oil, also laid out like flower petals and the bud is a grape tomato. 

3. A bowl of Mixed Seafood Cerviche. It consisted of pieces of octopus, calamari, salmon, mackerel, shrimp, crab, and lobster mixed with cucumber, red onion, yellow and red tomato, and jalapeños, which gave the dish a hint of spice. It was garnished with two long chives. 

4. A Miso Alaskan Black Cod was cooked to perfection - crispy, tender, and sweet miso marinate. It was served on a large piece of banana leaf with a drop of ponzu sauce at four corners of the dish. It was garnished with a two tone pickled ginger root (only the white part was edible), which served as a good palette cleanser. 

5. Slices of tender, medium to medium rare Beef Tenderloin marinated in balsamic teriyaki vinaigrette and topped with micro greens and wasabi salsa. The wasabi salsa gave flavor and heat to the dish. There was a dash of seven spices for those who love it extra spicy.

6. A Tower of Chilean Sea Bass Tempura Cubes, garnished with diced onions and jalapeño shavings in sweet Japanese rice vinegar. What an interesting combination. The tempura was crispy and the dish had a hint of jalapeño.

7. Five pan-seared and marinated in line-cilantro Langoustines over a bed of lettuce, zucchini, roasted white pearl onion, baby bok choy, caramelized onions, and mushrooms on a sizzling dish and garnished with Jalapeños and Japanese Chile Threads. It was my least favorite dish as it was drenched in oil and too spicy for me.

We finished our meal with something cool. 

7. A bowl of shaved ice and a few mini scoops of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with condensed milk, raspberry purée, and passion fruit purée, and topped with mochi, shredded coconut, fresh berries and grapes. Although it was the most popular dessert here, I felt it wasn't that special but it helped us cool off from the last dish.",EiT_pSuIb08oRn4CfwfMJg,1,0,4,lAGAs68lGjRuP74-QI5b8w
3625561,2013-03-03,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I took my best friend here for a late birthday celebration, last Tuesday.  With both of us being ""foodies"" (in the sense that we actually work in the food industry and have high standards in regards to service as well as the food itself...not those self-proclaimed foodies that have too much money to spend and no sense of what good food really is...), we had high expectations for a place that was undoubtedly going to cost $200, at least, for our experience. I say experience because that's what dining out at a place like this should be, not just ""a meal someplace"".  
Anyway, our reservation was at 5:00 on the dot.  We arrived just a few minutes before and was told by the hostess (who was my least favorite part of this whole experience and initially put a bitter taste in my mouth, questioning if I'd made the right choice to dine here) we'd have to ""wait 10 minutes"", even though we were the first to arrive.  She wasn't my idea of friendly and in my opinion, a weak asset to the restaurant.  
Never mind her, though. We were seated just after 5pm (and after several couples who arrived after us) and shortly after Troy, our server, greeted us and took our drink orders.  While our drinks were being made, we were overwhelmed by all of our food options.  Troy returned, asking if we'd like to start with some cold dishes or if we'd like for the chef to send out some of his favorite dishes (perhaps this isn't an option all guests have, but it was one we had, so we went with it - and no, it wasn't the chef's tasting menu that is available on the menu). Our drinks were brought to us by the bartender himself who was quite friendly, chatting with us about my friend's unique choice of beverage (Jameson and cranberry).
Troy brought out our first course (of NINE!), which was a yellow tail sashimi dish.  Oh. My. God. AMAZING!! In fact, EVERY dish we had was absolutely incredible. Our dishes started cold and ended hot, just as it should be.  The time in between each course was perfect and just long enough for us to chat and digest and mentally prepare for our next foodgasmic dish. 8 amazing savory dishes later, we were presented with a special dessert plate, which was equally as delicious as the rest of the meal.

I typically order the same things but definitely wanted something different.  This time around was different as I was open to eating anything and everything prepared.  It may be because I was unsure of what to order.  Nobu offers three different levels of Omakase.  We decided on the 2nd selection.    

We sat at the sushi bar, which allowed us to watch our sushi chef prepare each finite detail to our sushi dishes.  It was nice that each dish was already prepared with its specific accoutrement --so there was no need to soy and wasabi it up.  I definitely ate dishes that I wouldn't have picked out in a menu --Omakase is the way to go for sure.  With it being pricey, I would say for special occasions and as long as you are open to eating everything.

-I found our waitress to be very aloof, verging on unfriendly.

--By this time, you would like I'd just stop eating and cut my losses, but no. I ordered a chicken kabob and a steak kabob. The chicken was overcooked and dry and the steak was so UNDER cooked that I think I heard it moo...blood was oozing. Gross. 
--Their beers were TINY and $10 each. Ouch. 


Okay, now wanting to be fair, here are my husband's thoughts...a sushi pro:

-Overpriced, but expected.
-4 of the other people in our group gave a ""price point"" of $75 a person and said, serve whatever you want to us...he liked that.
-Their ""signature"" dish of black cod with miso was very delicious & succulent, everything else was ""fine""
-Annoying that it was being split between 4 people and they continuously gave portions of 5 or 6. Either give 4 or 8! How hard is that?!...it was like they wanted to start a brawl. 
-Wouldn't need to return, but don't regret going.


That about sums it up.",vxxKoGdOuXbRn9ngKFnJRA,4,0,2,aMycipvGdF-svgHoXoeRcw

We opted for the omakase, which gave us a great surprise for each course. However, in retrospect, I think it would have been better to just pick and choose to our hearts content because there were several courses that were complete misses for us. 

The standouts were: the sashimi and sushi courses (2nd and 4th courses). The rice was really what made the 2nd course so special for me. A little nit picky, but wished the tamagoyaki wasn't so grey in color. The sweet shrimp and fried shrimp head was probably my favorite thing. 

The not-so-good: the dessert course. I love dessert and to me, the birthday celebration revels in a wonderful dessert. Sadly, the dessert here, fried ice cream with spicy chocolate, candied fruit, and caramel sugar work tuille failed to deliver. The candied fruit was not properly candied and soggy and extremely chewy/hard to eat. The caramel sugar art was not very delicate and could take a tooth out. The fried ice cream itself was fine, but nothing really special. The presentation was special, but the taste failed to deliver.

I've always wanted to try Nobu and was very excited to see that there was one here in Vegas. I've been to many sushi restaurants, high-end ones such as Nobu included. Everywhere from Manhattan to San Francisco. So this is definitely not a biased, uninformed review. High prices are fine, if you have the amazing food and great customer service to back it up. My fiancé and I came to celebrate our birthdays here, which are only one day apart. My fiancé told the hostess it was our birthdays and she said OK great. Yet at the end of our $250 meal, nothing came. It's really disappointing because I see on their yelp photos that they do honor some birthdays. I guess their staff wasn't in the mood. Furthermore, we ordered three sushi rolls. Two of them came out and I was wondering what kind of sushi restaurant serves their rolls separately. We ate the 2 rolls they brought and then I realized they don't serve them separately, they just forgot and we had to remind them. Cmon Nobu, this is not splitting the atom. And you're supposedly a fancy high-priced sushi joint, so please live up to that. You don't. 

UPDATE: you know I just can't give them 3 stars because for such a pricy place, there's really no excuse for eh customer service.

3842699,2014-04-08,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"OH EM GEE!!

This was some pretty damn good sushi!!!

This is one of the best places to get sushi I have ever been to outside of Japan. The price for the quality and freshness of the fish combined with the originality and flavors of the dishes is more than worth it!

I ordered:

Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno
Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeno
Black Cod Miso
Salmon Sashimi
and Blue Fin Toro Sashimi

Each and every dish we were served was not only beautiful but taste even better than it looked!

The Yellowtail with Jalapeno had just enough kick for you to feel the heat in your mouth without losing the flavor of the Yellowtail. This is an extremely important trick when working with such high quality fish!

The rock shrimp was fantastic! It was rich and creamy and comes on top of a salad that has a nice citrus flavor to cut through the richness of the cream sauce. extremely well balanced and exactly what I wanted from the dish.

The Black Cod Miso was also very good. This is one of my favorite dishes to order when I see it on a menu. Not many places have it and this one definitely ranks right up there in my top 1-2 spot. Only Irori in Marina Del Rey may have a slightly better dish. The two are extremely close though.

The Salmon sashimi was melt in your mouth good. Salmon is by far my favorite when there is no blue fin on the menu and the sashimi here is super fresh!

Last we finished with the Bluefin Toro!!!! At $20 a piece it's not cheap. However, if you love sushi you have to try it at least once. There is just no comparison to other types of fish. When you order it just bite the bullet and get at least two pieces per person. If you only order one you're just going to be asking your server for one more piece anyways then probably another one after that.

To top off the great food the service was fantastic. I don't remember our servers names but they were super friendly and helpful. The décor is beautiful and this is by far one of the nicest sushi places I have ever been to!

Be warned though. It's not cheap at all. Even if I hadn't ordered the Bluefin I would have easily spent over $200 between two people with a couple of drinks. As it was I spent closer to $400. I've been to well over 100 different sushi places in my life and If you really love good sushi you have to try this place at least once. It's well worth the money.",SGqGBo7mRZ1OYm0ODepDFw,1,1,5,9n9Oc5hsZUr1YGs-qFk4Xg

3847928,2018-01-21,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Be forewarned, yes the food here is pricey, so most of you wonder if the food really worth it's price? I believe it is, and this was only my 2nd time here.

I made a reservation for 1 at 8pm on Monday, and was seated as soon as I showed up at 7:50pm. 

The first time was right before New Years in December and that time I had the Chef's Daily Creations Omakase for $225/pp with 2 other people. However, this time I had the $150 Nobu Signature Omakase (was $125 in 2017).

This 7 course plus soup and dessert tasting menu is well worth it and was much different from the Chef's Daily Creations Omakase.

Before choosing the Omakase, I decided to go with the Kikori Old Fashioned cocktail which Yesenia, my server procured for me quite quickly. I ended up drinking a total of 2 over the course of my meal. The Kikori Old Fashioned is highly recommended if you like whiskey and Old Fashioneds. The serving size is worth it for its price.

The service throughout the whole tasting menu was superb, so if you are willing to do an Omakase please set aside at least 1 hour and 45 minutes to fully enjoy the meal and all the courses.

From my calculations all the food I received cost $230 with portion size taken into account.

My top 3 favorite dishes throughout this tasting were the aged Bluefin tuna, toro tartare, and black cod miso. 

The aged Bluefin tuna was unlike any other tuna nigiri I've had, it melted in my mouth and had so much flavor that I've never experienced before. As a sushi lover, this is a must each time you go to Nobu.

The toro tartare, was something I initially did not expect to like, however after the first scoop, I was amazed at the blend of the sauce, toro, and caviar.

The signature black cod miso, was just as expected. Cooked perfectly, portioned well, and had extra sauce if you want more flavor. It's a must at Nobu if you want one of his signature dishes.

The other dishes were also superb, but those 3 stood out in my opinion.

To finish out the tasting menu the chocolate molten lava cake paired with fruit and green tea ice cream was icing on the cake to end the meal.

Overall the SIgnature Omakase tasting menu has less food than the Chef's Daily Creations, but is well worth it if you have never been to Nobu and would like to taste what he's known for.

Now having done both, I might order a la carte, or do another tasting just for the value.",uaYX8_MzGaEl2q31ybX35Q,2,0,5,_iq7ywtxsuFO0VdRxR9vFQ
3853015,2014-03-25,6,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I want to be clear that this is review is specific to the Nobu restraurant in Ceasar's Palace Nobu hotel, not the one in The Hard Rock. I assume the establishments are the same in their methods, however, since this is a chain. 

Verdict: Awful. 

I would give it one star, except I am feeling generous today, unlike the portions at Nobu. And to be fair, I expected such. What I didn't expect was a sub-par sushi experience for the price and the hype. 

The hubs and I are VERY experienced Sushi diners and we tend to eat high end. We know our hamachi from our bonito. We don't generally do the Western dip everything in (fake)  wasabi and soy. We prefer sashimi, but explore the interesting world of inari maki, temaki, Japanese warm plates, etc...  BUT THIS PLACE!

Our hamachi in sushi form wasn't fresh and the rice to fish ratio was off. Our seared (not mentioned on the menu that it is served seared) bonito was a little too seared and drowning in some type of nikiri that over-powered the fish completely. 

This is to say nothing of what is supposedly Nobu's signature dish: Black Miso Cod. It is my understanding that he invented it, but I guess it has been perfected elsewhere because I have had MUCH better. Sushi Den in Denver comes to mind... The fish was just over-cooked to that point when cod changes from a delicate mouth-pleasing texture to a rubber tire. The miso sauce, however, was passable. 

And the service was awesome. Um. NO. I'm only kidding. One of our servers (we had more than one) asked us how we felt about the cod and we were honest that we'd had better, but it wasn't terrible. Guess what happened next? We were treated to a very snarky come-back. WOW. 

Bottom line, we wound up leaving without ordering much more, spent too much (which we ARE ALWAYS prepared to do for a meal which is worth it) AND wound up having a great dinner at Gordon Ramsey's BURGR.

I will say this place isn't cheap perhaps somewhere else is a better choice if $$$-$$$$ per person is above your comfort zone. However, I was anticipating a highlight of my dining experience and prepared to do my part.

Ok having set my mindset.  My server was excellent with a vast knowledge of the menu and willing to spend the time so I could understand. The menu is huge. Don't go here for an old favorite from somewhere else. Let them take you on a culinary adventure you will never forget.

My recommendation is the chefs prix fixe menu this comes at three different levels.  I opted for the top level.  I believe there were 5 courses each having several different components. As they will be different for you I will not bore you with every item but say that each was amazing. There was Wagu, diver scallop, foie gras, fish selections I have never seen before and the best caviar legally available in this count, straight from Russia house.  And if that is not enough gold leaf on one item.

It was beautiful and each item completely explained as it was presented.
If cheap fish is what you want I know a great Vietnamese place on Spring Mountain road that has the best whole flounder for cheap and deboned table side. If an experience is what you want then look no further in Las Vegas.",kwYT85HIWHxv3Y5xRrcSnA,0,0,5,5iHu7VUKm9qGHBmCG40ZhA

I never had sushi so fresh and  good in my life! Salmon, just regular salmon, melts in your mouth. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere. It kind of looks outdated and confused.

I also wasn't a huge fan of seeing the kitchen as I was walking to the bathroom either. The awkward eye contact I had to make with the kitchen staff.....

My husband and I stated we've been to other Nobu's and our server goes on a 5 minute rant about how this location is totally different from other ones and don't expect the same experience. It came off in a very condescending way, almost like he was berating us. Side note: the menu and dinner presentation was the same as the other locations, so not sure why he said it was  different. 

The Food: I always get the same thing. Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp was good, but smaller portion compared to other times I have had it. Miso Black Cod was also delicious and melted in my mouth. Only bad thing is it will set you back $37. Bento Box dessert was also not as good as the other locations. I guess my expectations were too high. I also like to get their seasonal cocktails. This time it was the Buddhas Passion, with apricot sake, vodka, lemon and passion tea-- very refreshing! 

Overall, this dining experience was okay. I definitely prefer other locations.",OH93UQIpOSHdYH86UEflhw,7,0,3,BrSkmwPo3HCqMeNktSIMQg

To start, the ambiance of this place was great. Our waiter came by and explained the menu and the nobu experience to us. Expect to be at the restaurant for at least 2 hours. We were a larger group, so we were there for 4 hours. The dishes are prepared so intricately. I ordered the miso black cod, which was my favorite dish that I tried. In addition, I order the waygu gyosza, and salmon tartare with caviar, both so very delicious. To end, I had the California roll, which I expected to be much better than any ordinary California roll, but it actually tasted like a regular California roll (they do not use imitation crab).

Anyone who thinks their sushi is good, hasn't had real sushi. Now that the cons section is over, let me explain why they're getting 4 stars from me.

The black cod is delish. It was probably the best cod I've had. I never thought cod could be so good (actually fish n chips are pretty good too lol). If I had ordered a bowl of rice on the side, this would have been pretty filling for $38.

The Japanese wagyu was everything I had hoped it to be and then some. The sauce was great. It was super tender and although some pieces were a bit more marbled than I would have liked, it was very memorable overall. 6 oz at $38/oz is a steep price..  but if you're going to Nobu, you're willing to splurge anyways right? Might as well go all out.

The yellowtail to me was good, but I'm not a big yellowtail person. I could live without ordering this again. Now I'm off to the bento box dessert. I'm sure that'll be good.",4kf96n-Z8jG9oa0ZnRyb7A,0,0,4,_Bhk0bEdZDFX2-lUlEQ7xg

I made a 5 PM reservation because I wanted to have plenty of time to do one of the omakase options and I wanted to have enough time before the 7:30 show at the Colosseum.  

Matthew was my server.  He explained the menu to me after I was seated and then he answered questions I had about the omakase and the time requirements.  I ended up with the Signature omakase which consists of 7 courses plus dessert.  Two hours later, the meal was over and it was excellent.

Course 1 was a vegetable temaki.  Thin, long pieces of vegetables in very tasty nori.

Course 2 was the Nobu sashimi salad.  I don't remember the names of the different fish for several of the courses.  Suffice it to say that the salad was plated nicely and the fish selection was good.

Course 3 was the sushi course with nigiri sushi.  Besides the sushi, there was a cube of crispy rice topped with salmon tartare and some roe.  I was advised to eat the sushi from left to right.  Everything was excellent and the crispy rice finish was superb!

Course 4 was the last cold course.  It was called the tartare course and there was a salmon tartare in the center in a homemade ponzu sauce, yellowtail to the left, and a whitefish ceviche.  The courses represented the chef's time in South America and had excellent flavors.  I was advised to eat the tartare first.  I was given a small serving spoon to carefully spread the roe on top and then advised to dip straight down and have some roe, tartare, and sauce with each bite.  Excellent.  Then it didn't matter which side I ate but they advised that is save the yamamomo, Japanese mountain peach, for last to transition to the next course.

Course 5 was the first hot course and it was black cod miso wrapped in a leaf and opened by the server at the table.  The fish was superbly cooked and was very tasty.

Course 6, the second hot course, was beef tenderloin with enoki mushrooms and an asparagus spear.  It was brought with a napkin covering the top to protect the server as he lifted the top off the cast iron pan.  It was steaming it was so hot.  The flavor was marvelous!

Course 7 was back to a cold course.  This was a small serving of green tea noodles in a delightful sauce.

Dessert was a bento box with a chocolate cake with a scoop of green tea ice cream and some fresh berries.  It was a fairly light and delicious way to end the meal.

The time passed quickly, the food was great, and the service matched.  The restaurant became quite busy.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,11,5,BWHu339_wkLBilzHcXvV9w

He talked so fast though. So we didn't fully understand. But again it didn't ruin dinner. 

Now just letting you guys know. This place is pretty pricey for the amount of food. I didn't complain too much, because I wasn't paying. But for you payers. Take note of that.

How can they screw up the basic given in sushi 101 and I'll say it again given as in my sushi rice should be cooked.

Upon first impressions the ambiance was good - trendy and the kind of thing you'd expect from a Japanese fusion eatery. The waitstaff were all very attentive and helpful at navigating the menu and recommending the best dishes. 

Overall the food was good, not great. We sampled a mix of cold and hot appetizers and entrees as well as the sushi. The quality of ingredients was good, as was the presentation, however the flavor of the dishes didn't match. 

Highlights: Try the crispy rice and tuna tartar appetizer. It was something different and put a nice spin on a standard tartar. The sushi was good quality and what you'd expect from the place like Nobu. The toro was excellent, as were the uni, amaebi and unagi. The unagi sauce was quite good and made in house which is a departure from the shimmering gloop most sushi joints in the states serve.

Low lights: The yakitori dishes were a disappointment overall. We sampled the beef, shrimp, sea bass and pork belly. They come with your choice of teriyaki sauce or a South American style chimichurri - neither were very good. The teriyaki sauce was overbearing and much too sweet. The South American option had a nice kick but seemed out of place with Japanese ingredients. The pork belly was too gelatinous, as if it had been cooked and left to cool for many hours - skip it. 

Overall Nobu is a lot of hype and shines too brightly amongst other, far better sushi options off The Strip. Come for the ambiance and the trend factor. But if you're looking for the best quality sashimi and nigiri, look elsewhere.",tbhiRhBpVCfopKBfKBx5WA,0,0,3,NTKHq8Vv22kEVl3WFN3bSA

My friend really loves sushi and I wasn't that hungry, so... fine.  Nobu.  Truth is... I'd never actually had sushi.  I had some lobster roll once and couldn't get past the seaweed wrapper.  Almost turned blue and, well... it wasn't pretty.  Anyway... they seated us in the lounge area in a huge booth.  No one behind us.  Clear view of the entire place.  Felt like we had the best table.  I scanned the menu to try to find something I would actually eat.  Wagyu.  That works. Chicken, too.  Shrimp Tempura.  I can do that.  The server (super hot; in fact... all the servers are ridiculously gorgeous)  was convinced that I'd like sushi if I just tried it.  I explained my issue with the seaweed.  She smiled (knowing what an idiot I am, of course) and said rolls are one way to eat it, but that I needed to trust her.  She said her brother hated it, as well... but once he tried it... he loved it.  She suggested the ""Omakase"" - a tasting from across the menu.  You give them a price point (ours was $125 per person).  They ask if you have allergies, what you like/dislike... and you get a series of signature items delivered over the next hour. Ordered a lychee sake and... as I looked around, I realized that it was our last night and this was a nice place. Ok.

""Amazing"" is an understatement.  One of the best meals I've had.  Ever.  The first dish was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  Wow.  It was incredible.  Next up was a red snapper sashimi with lime.  Another sashimi... this one salmon with sesame, ginger, and green onion.  Then came the beef tenderloin (my least favorite dish of the night), followed up by black cod miso (wonderful flavor), creamy/spicy shrimp tempura, and then the sushi... albacore (holy mother of god this was good) and bluefin.  The final dish was a dessert... chocolate cake and green tea ice cream (with berries).  Topped it off with an espresso and called it a night.  With tip, the bill came out to about $450 for two.

 Where do I begin on the food here ... I'll try my best to put what I've had into words. I'm rarely at a loss of words when it comes to food... Their menu is designed so you go light to heavy, cold to hot. Each dish, including their sashimi based dishes are a complex explosion of flavors that seems so simple, yet creates this complex enigma of flavor in your mouth. So we started off with assorted fishes prepared in different ways. All of their fish is VERY FRESH and flown in each day. If you're not quite sure on what to order like me, I recommend getting their pre-fixe menus and than swapping things out a-la-carte. Some of the more unique things i had is their fried sticky rice balls. We asked for it along with our Wagyu beef at the end and it was a great pairing as the rice balanced out the sodium of the beef. Their Wagyu Beef (at $30+ an oz.) is simply put, breathtaking. The first bites was one of those rare moments where our group was silent, everyone enjoying a piece of it. Their beef is finished off infront of you with flaming river stones. No that wasn't a typo, they're flaming river stones (check my video if you don't believe me). If you wanted it more then medium rare, it was recommended you leave it on a little bit longer. When they charge you $30+ an oz on beef, you gotta be a little skeptical but the balance of fat, meat, flavor and juice in this beef was just definitely worth it. I recommend everyone trying at least one piece per person! We had around 10 dishes for 6 people so we were a bit full for dessert so can't speak much on that, but the food here at Nobu is definitely worth it!
Service: 9/10
 I don't usually give service a high rating because my expectations change with each establishment I visit so I don't think it's fair to put them all on the same scale. But here at Nobu, the service, even for a high-level restaurant, was outstanding. Their servers act like an encyclopaedia between you and the chef, explaining the menu and each dish with great detail. They're extremely knowledgable with each dish from describing how the flavors are supposed to mix and how the dish should be best enjoyed to where their ingredients come from and exactly what you're getting. The service here is, simply put, beyond expectations.
Overall: 10/10
Additional Notes: Definitely worth coming here! They have nice private booths/tables if you require as well as some Hibachi tables (but from what I can tell, no one does Hibachi anymore). When you come here, be prepared to leave with your stomach enlightened and your wallet lightened.",xmrQ4b6HXstn-TA4D0YZxw,1,0,5,u3qlt7lyPUdIFoR9S4KLpA
4108194,2015-11-02,4,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"In a way, it's a disappointment that I'm not giving five stars.

Nobu is a name with weight. It stands for a world-renowned chef and a decorated series of restaurants, many of which have earned Michelin stars. This one in particular has none, although that may be due to unfortunate circumstances, namely the lack of Michelin stars for years now in Las Vegas. Regardless, you can't help but want to try this Peruvian-Japanese cuisine for yourself, and you should.

We went to Nobu in Caesar's Palace to celebrate a friend's birthday. We waited an hour to get seated, we waited a bit too long to receive a menu, and we spent more time while trying to figure out what we wanted to get from the expensive menu. Let's be honest - this isn't a place that you try every day, but price is still a factor.

Our server was helpful in explaining the menu, highlighting menu favorites, and mentioning seasonal items and specials. I would have preferred more writing, but I understand that availability of fish can change often. Anyway, he said he could help work out a menu for us with the chef if we told him what sorts of fish and such that we wanted to eat, and he espoused the virtues of the omakase menus, but after a while we decided just to order and share specific menu items. Others may find that service useful.

Cold items and sushi were presented first, then hot items. And yes, I include prices in my reviews, so deal with it:

Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño ($29): this is a really good dish that's not executed wisely. We were instructed to eat a small bit of cilantro with each of the six slices of hamachi, in addition to the jalapeño. See, the thing about piling all the cilantro in the middle is that one person grabbed a little too much cilantro for one piece of fish, which ended up depriving other pieces. This means that because they didn't give extra pieces of a very cheap herb, they prevented the dish from being consistent.

Uni nigiri ($10/pc): some of the best Santa Barbara uni that I've had. Has the essence of the sea, but not in an overpowering way. Sweet. If you haven't had good uni, you haven't lived, so you might as well try it here if you're already gonna be here.

New Style Sashimi - scallop ($35): yeah, I don't quite understand this. The soy sauce, oils, chives, sesame seeds, and ginger were interesting components, but I wouldn't miss those flavors. Plus, the scallop felt like it was sliced too thinly. Maybe I should have gone with the beef?

Soft shell crab cut roll ($20): our server did warn us about this, or rather the entire sushi menu. He said that it wouldn't be anything special compared to other places, and that he always recommends that his guests order off the cold and hot menus. He was right in this case. It was good, but it wasn't worth it when you can get something similar at AYCE sushi places.

Black cod miso ($36): regarded as Chef Nobu's signature dish, this is certainly the best rendition of the dish that I've enjoyed. Incredibly tender cod with sweet flavor, some of which is provided by the sauce that I still can't pinpoint flavor-wise. Regardless, this is definitely my favorite of the night and a must-order.

Squid ""pasta"" with light garlic ($27): squid cut to resemble pasta. I was disappointed initially with the relatively small portion of tender and tasty squid, but thinking back, I'm sure the price would have to be significantly higher to have the right squid ratio. However, the dish grew on me as I kept at it. The vegetables were all executed perfectly, from zucchini to snap peas to the shiitake mushrooms. Strangely, the veggies remind me of kebabs that I've had. In a great way. I'd say that even though my expectations weren't met, I was pleased overall.

Rock shrimp tempura, spicy creamy style ($26): I don't know about this one. It was good, but it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped. The spicy creamy variant was described as the most popular preparation style by far (as opposed to butter ponzu or jalapeño), but I would have hoped for shrimp that was a little more firm. Maybe you can't do that with this shrimp, but this veers a little too closely to feeling mushy to me. That, and the flavor just isn't extravagant or complex and reminds you of versions of shrimp that are much cheaper.

Flourless bento box ($15): it was a very good chocolate lava cake (with white chocolate and shiso syrup). As expected, I did enjoy the blueberry and the piece of starfruit that I was able to taste, but I would've liked more blackberries and a more prominent role for the matcha ice cream. The ice cream definitely took a back seat to the powerful dark chocolate.

I enjoyed everything, so of course I'm going to go with at least four stars - but no higher, I am certain that you can get better food at a better value elsewhere. For example, there are comparable, even superior cold dishes at Yonaka Modern Japanese just a few miles away. Make Nobu a one-time visit or a special occasion meal, and get the black cod miso.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,5,4,QmIcLHfSiVqG0Wqvfg7F7Q

4126719,2017-11-02,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I needed to update my review (still 5/5 stars for this LV location) because the must-try dishes when dining at Nobu include:
1. Premium Imported Japanese Wagyu A5 $38 per ounce & make sure to get it on the stones set on fire w/ Courvoisier (we typically have a party of 6-8 ppl so we order 12-16 ounces) but this is so worth it if you don't live in or near Japan
2. Black Cod Miso Lettuce Cups (the cod w/o lettuce cups is good too)
3. Yellowtail Sashimi w/ jalapeno 
4. Salmon Sashimi
5. Hamachi Kama - baked
6. Variety of Oysters (allow them to surprise you w/ the diff. toppings they offer. Very fun!) 
7. Wagyu sashimi

I only have great things to say about the customer service at this location and the manager, Keenan, is the best. He's genuine, honest, & very personable.

He was uber attentive, and the dishes he picked were exquisite.  A funny twist was that I told him I wanted the toro with oestra caviar,  and he told me that if I liked toro, I'd like the toro carpaccio dish more.  I took his word for it, and he started the personalized menu.  A few minutes later, we got the toro plate with the caviar.  I figured he decided to go with my original suggestion.  We started to indulge in it, and he came by and told us he was sorry, it was meant for another table.  So, he comped us the plate and still brought the carpaccio.  He most definitely did not have to do this as we had no idea what our ""menu"" consisted of, but he really wanted us to try the other dish.  That made all the difference in the world, and, by the way, the carpaccio was leaps and bounds better.

This restaurant is ENORMOUS and thus is pretty cavernous on a weekday night at 9pm, which is when we went. As a two-top we were made to wait for 20 minutes at the bar for a lounge table even though the lounge area was only half full and the table at which we were eventually seated was open when we walked in. Meh.

We ordered the omakase (125 bones for the ""Chef's Selection"" version - there's a longer tasting menu for 175). The first four courses were all sashimi salads. In order: tuna with yuzu soy sauce, seared salmon belly with miso crumble and yuzu soy sauce, hamachi with cilantro, jalapeno and yuzu citrus glaze, sea bass with miso, crispy garlic and yuzu olive oil. ALL YUZU EVERYTHING. The fish was very high quality, but by the fourth course I think my citrus taste buds had punched in their overtime and gone home. Meh.

A waiter then brought us a fine-looking plate of tuna sashimi, which our server had to unceremoniously repossess a few minutes later, as it was not part of the omakase and delivered by mistake. We were told that a sushi plate was to follow later. Meh.

The fifth and sixth courses were the Nobu signature miso-glazed sea bass with grilled asparagus, which was excellent, and a definitely not-medium-rare steak teppanyaki with enoki mushrooms, which was just okay - ""meh"" if you will. 

The seventh course was puzzling, a bowl of jalapeno-mayonnaise glazed rock shrimp that appeared like an appetizer pulling up fashionably late to the meal progression. We didn't finish it.

The promised sushi plate arrived as the eighth course, in the form of spicy tuna rolls. MEEEHHH.

Fortunately the dessert was great. Flourless molten chocolate cake, fresh fruit and four flavors of mochi ice cream. It was uniformly awesome.

250 for dinner for two before tax, tip and drinks is not outlandish in Vegas but no one could or should call you snobby for expecting more out of a restaurant that looks this impressive and bears the Nobu brand name.

4325895,2016-01-06,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Been here a few times as CES ritual. One star hands down is for their sushi menu and how nasty the quality and taste of their fish. It was so gross and after all these years, I continue hearing friends' upset and raging experience how bad their quality of all the fish is. I always forgot to remind my friends not to order anything fish related at this restaurant. And yes, they will sell you a $200 bottle of sake that tastes like water !


Four star for their teppanyaki and wagyu beef. It was a bummer that they refused to give us two seats at teppanyaki table even though I had reservation from few weeks back. I was craving for wagyu beef and been waiting all day for this meal. They said they could serve it at table too. We ordered it flamed style as that's pretty much the only decent option they offered, it was $38 an ounce vs what it says on their online menu $26 which is probably for non-ces days. We ordered 8 ounces and was very delish!! We ordered foie gras which they billed you $50 for an order. Yes it's Vegas and its Nobu that's known for the rip-off. While our server tried selling me caviar, I went for it but he was nice enough to repeat our order with price, and the small jar of three tea spoons full of sturgeon caviar cost $350!!!! I repeated myself to him 3 times and totally sounded silly. Of course I cancelled it ! 

Nobu is a place that is very tricky for their food and price. They raised menu price up 2x during ces or convention to balance out the business in slow season, and companies have the money to spend anyway! If you had loads of cash to spend, DO NOT ever order fish related item at this place, that said, don't even look at caviar either. Always go for cooked items such as miso black cod, beef items and so, to make the most of your meal!

They do have good selection of whiskey such as Japanese Yamazaki, Hibiki and Hakushu (not avail in the US) with reasonable price which means it's not doubled than their value . This is the reason that got me to give 3-star instead of 2!",mNEiXpydrH_CzaLKe2BLrA,1,0,3,d93AmOol0nDTegmMml2zTQ

4352256,2017-05-24,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Let's be honest, I've always known about Nobu and how great it is from word of mouth/yelp reviews, but what actually brought me here was on a whim after listen to that Jump Man song. After giggling about how weird it is to sing NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU, we decided on a fly to make a reservation a few months out. Well, it has met all of my expectations and a little more.

We had a 5 star experience once we were at the restaurant, but the only gripe I have is that I made a reservation for early May way back in early March. When the time got closer, I had to reschedule due to an obligation, and when I called in, it looks like my reservation was never put in the calendar. The hostess asked me if I had the right location, which I did, so I just made a new reservation. So if you're looking to make a reservation, I would call a few days ahead just in case so you don't run into what happened to me!

We had the omakase dinner, and the waiter will take your preferences and dietary concerns to create a tasting menu with the chef. We wanted about half hot dishes and cold/sushi dishes, and I requested dishes that weren't heavy on dairy (since I'm lactose sensitive). We started out with the champagne 95 and grapefruit on the rocks. Both were great! The champagne 95 was fresh/crisp/refreshing with orange liquor, peach liquor, and pineapple & roederer champagne. The grapefruit on the rocks tasted more of just grapefruit juice without much of a kick or other flavor besides grapefruit. 

All dishes we got were amazing to a point that I can't speak highly enough of our waiter, Columbia, creating such an extraordinary menu. The only things I didn't really care for was the beef toban-yaki. The beef toban-yaki is in an ancho chile sauce, and I think that's what threw me off. The sauce was a little too intense for me, but I also think that this dish would be a favorite for many other people. It's just not for me, but it might be for you... so try it out and make up your mind for yourself. 

My favorite items happened to be the cheapest (you could say i'm a cheap date, I guess??). They were the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, spinach salad with dry miso, and the salmon sashimi new style. Each had great flavor and were so unique in their own right. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno was served with ponzu sauce. It was slightly sweet, savory, and absolutely perfect. The spinach salad with dry miso was fresh, and the miso dried miso gave it a nice, salty crunch. The miso is broken up into very small pieces, so it isn't so overwhelmingly salty.


List of what we got:
Champagne 95
Grapefruit on the rocks
Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno
Spicy miso chips with big eye tuna
Spinach salad with dry miso
Salmon sashimi new style
Black cod miso
Rock shrimp with jalapeno sauce
Beef toban-yaki
2 scallop with wasabi salsa
2 albacore sushi
2 tamago sushi
1 miso tart


Overall, I would come back to Nobu for maybe a special occasion or if I'm feeling zesty. The food is amazing and the service from the waiter is extraordinary. I would get the omakase again. The only reservation about Nobu is the hostesses making your reservations. You should definitely call a few days ahead to confirm your reservation.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,3,2,4,BBIWbRWMUlpOuaAG4DBRLQ

This was by a long shot my favorite meal in LV...probably one of my top two favorite meals of 2014 so far.  The food is incredible, the atmosphere, music and general ambiance, is both sexy and fun.  I would have gladly eaten there several times if I had unlimited funds.

I have always been interested in Nobu  during my many trips to NYC.  The locations there are very hard to get into at a decent hour, so when I was easily able to score a table at the location in Caesars at a prime time it was a no-brainer.

We had many different items...all were incredible...but here were our favorites:

Miso Marinated Black Cod--plain and simply ridiculous eating pleasure...hard to explain how good this is.  The fish is cooked perfectly and the top is almost like a creme brulee from the miso marinade.  Crackly, sweet and a perfect match for the succulent, luxurious black cod beneath it.

Crispy rice with big eye tuna...a  phenomenal combination of sushi grade tuna and crunch.

Mini bite sized tacos, salmon and wagyu...perfect crispy meat filled bites.  They are small, but flavor and texture perfection.

Yellowtail Sahimi with jalapeno--doesn't sound special, but the glistening, fresh fish, sitting in a delicate citrus sauce, with the slightest slice of jalapeno on top is flavor magic on the tongue.  The yellowtail is mellow and smooth, with a hint of sweet and acidic citrus and a touch of heat from the pepper.  Better than I could ever make it sound with words.

Finally dessert...Nobu Shaved ice...this one again on paper did nothing for me...Shaved ice, with condensed milk poured over it, toasted coconut, bean paste and tofu ice cream...doesn't even sound appealing in all honesty...I couldn't stop eating it!

The ambiance is stunning, the service is exceptional, and the cuisine is phenomenal in every sense.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a lovely hostess who escorted us to a fantastic table surrounded by a wicker cocoon where we could observe passers-by in the casino but still felt intimate and private.  Our server, Amber, was quick to visit our table with menus.  When she learned we had dined there before, she suggested we consider having the chef design our dining experience and asked for budget parameters.  A very smart way to create a custom prix-fixe.  We chose to dismiss the menus without even looking and let the chef's selections begin.  Our first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  It happens to be one my favorites.  Bright delicate slices of yellowtail with a light lime infused sauce topped with slashes of jalapeno.  How such a simple dish can be so wonderous is beyond me.  Gorgeous pure unpretentious presentation that burst with flavor.  Next up, Soft Shell Crab Tempura.  A generous portion of perfectly prepared crab.  Crisp, just the right amount of batter, and seasoned to bring out the natural essence and not mask the flavor of this fantastic crustacean.  Maybe the best soft-shell crab I've ever had.  It was about at this point that Aaron Hopwood, the Bar Manager/Sommelier, paid our table a visit to check on us.  What a nice touch.  Aaron was sincerely interested in our dining experience and it gave us a chance to give praise to the immaculate service we were receiving from Amber and the rest of the team.  It's rare to find such exceptional, efficient and warm care.  Following the crab was the Filet Mignon with Crispy Onions.  The filet was nestled under wisps of fried onions that were so delicate they absolutely melted in your mouth.  The filet was medium rare, and thinly sliced in a light sauce.  The combination was sensational.  For our closing course, the chef chose to present a special sushi plate with various filets and rolls.  The highlight for me was it included two delicately fried Sawangani River Crabs.  These tiny fresh water crabs are about the size of a silver dollar and are eaten whole.  They are so crispy, crunchy, and flavorful.  I've only had them once before in my life and absolutely fell in love with these exotic crab delicacies.  What a treat.

Came here for dinner with my in-laws on a whim, because the buffet line was way too long. I was super stoked to try this place, but I was pretty disappointed with the meal. 

Recap:
1. Decor/Atmosphere - Very nice. Back when I was young and single, I totally would have rolled up to this place to impress my now-wife. Swanky decorations that oozes class, balla', and sophistication. 

2. Food - Quality of the food is good. I feel like they use very expensive, high-end ingredients, but the food wasn't executed very well. Nothing that we ordered really ""Wow'ed"" me. 

3. Drinks - Delicious! The drinks here are very good, but will set you back $15 bucks/drink. 

4. Price - No bueno. The food was hella expensive for what you get. If I got a little more for my money or if the food was outstanding, I would be okay spending money here. But to spend an arm and leg on mediocre food broke my heart. 

5. Baby Friendly - Not really. Yes, they did have high chairs, but no changing tables in the men's room. 

6. Staff - Phenomenal service. I think we had 3-4 servers running food and tending to us. Knowledgeable about the food and made some decent recommendations. 

Overall, I had a good time here. I probably wouldn't be back because of the prices/portions, but I'm glad I checked this place off my bucket list.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,4,2,3,tI3xXn8BU65aP-Sah39COQ

Been wanting to try a restaurant owned by Chef Nobu for a long time and just had to give it a go when I stumbled upon ""Nobu"" at the Caesars Palace.

The menu has hot and cold fare priced from $10+ with a big list of sushi and sashimi to choose from. The nigiri do not come in pairs. Sushi is ordered by the piece and it ranges from $5 to $90. At the same time there are also sushi rolls and hand rolls as options.

The Alaskan black cod miso $34 was seasoned nicely and grilled to perfection. It came with a beautiful stalk of pickled ginger root which the sushi chef pointed it out that the tip was edible.  I ended up eating the whole stalk because it tasted really good.

There are sushi bar or the lounge bar to choose from if dining alone. 

I think the fact that this restaurant is located in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas made it quite high-profile and at the same time allowing them to command the steep prices.

There's no way to leave this place feeling satisfied without spending at least $100 per person.",8BV5Hm4Nygujx3cdoP_EtA,1,1,4,uk1SlJ-l6USPI8ne1oBuKg
4397560,2018-02-03,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Nobu blew my mind! Not only it had amazing food, the service was absolutely outstanding. You are served by at least 5 people in addition to your waiter, and every staff member walking by is trained to ensure your dining experience is flawless.  To start with, I wore a little black cocktail dress to the restaurant, and when I settled, there were white napkins on the table. My white napkin was quickly removed, and a black napkin put in its place. (!!!!). My husband dropped his napkin without noticing, and a passing by staff member put a clean napkin next to his plate, picked up the dropped one and disappeared. And in everything from bringing food out to refilling your drinks, to taking the empty plates away, Nobu provided the most authentic service we have ever experienced 
Now to the food - Nobu is known for Japanese cuisine infused with Peruvian flavors. Every morsel of fish explodes with flavors in your mouth. Cocktails are unique and flavorful. The green tea is only surpassed by the tea we had in Japan. 
The menu was difficult to navigate for a Nobu newby, but to make your selection less stressful, there is a pre-selected chef menu and you server can select food for You, based on your preference and price.  We asked for fish only, and around $125 per person, and thoroughly enjoyed the food they brought us. The most memorable were the sashimi style dishes with raw slices of fish served with different sauces. Yellow tail jalapeno was a treat. Miso salmon. The presentation was also top notch. We will definitely be back when in Vegas next.

4444166,2013-02-16,6,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Before I start my review, I must warn the reader that the one star rating is purely relative. The rating is not because the food was too expensive. Rather, I believe that a restaurant that charges this much deserves to be compared against the very best restaurants in the world that charge a similar premium. If I were to compare Nobu to other teppan yaki restaurants such as Benihana or Hamada it would easily receive 4 or 5 stars based on the ingredients used and quality of food alone (for the most part).

Originally my plan was to eat sushi and sashimi at Hyakumi, the other Japanese Restaurant at Caesars Palace at 8PM. However, I found out that Hyakumi is now closed for dinner so I went to the Diamond Lounge around 8:15 PM and talked to a receptionist who informed me of Nobu's grand opening. He apologized and said that there is no sushi at Nobu but he could reserve a teppan yaki table for 2 at 11:00 PM. When I walked into Nobu I was a little annoyed to see that there was indeed a sushi bar as well a non-teppan yaki seating. Although this does not (and should not) effect my rating for Nobu (because it is Caesars's fault), I feel like this little tidbit of information is necessary. It is certainly reasonable to think that I may have perhaps approached my experience at Nobu with a bit of negative bias. I personally believe that this is not the case. However, I still urge you to read on with caution. 

I came into Nobu with pretty high expectations because the Nobu at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas was highly acclaimed and was even adorned with a Michelin Star once upon a time. I went into my meal intrigued as to how a teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise, and then I found out that there is no teppan yaki at the Nobu at Hard Rock (go figure). In any case, I sat at my teppan yaki table and had only two tasting choices available for order. There was no a la carte option. I ordered the $280 per person option and the other option was a bit cheaper (I think $190?...I don't remember for certain). Although the sake menu was limited, my taste for dry sake was well met at a very reasonable price ($25). 

The tasting menu that I ordered offered a variety of different courses including Toro tartare, seared foie gras, Maine lobster tail, wagyu steak, and Jamon de Iberico fried rice. 

First, the Toro tartare was certainly interesting. It was served in a wasabi based reduction and was essentially chopped up toro (fatty tuna) mixed with a variety of spices and topped with caviar. While good, I still have some reservations regarding this dish. To me, it is a bit pretentious to take toro, chop it up and add caviar on top with some fancy sauce. As they say at the tables, you don't mess with winners. Don't split 10s, don't double down on blackjack, and don't mess with toro. Toro by itself is one of the most delicious foods in the world.

Furthermore, the foie gras was overdone. Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt in your mouth. This foie gras overwhelmingly tasted burnt with a bit of crunch After a couple of chews, the foie gras did ultimately melt. That said, I just could not muster up the courage to tell our table side chef to his face that he had royally messed up the foie gras. One of the weaknesses that teppan yaki opens itself up to is a potential for inconsistency. The lobster tail and the wagyu beef, however, were immaculate, and could not be cooked better. The wagyu beef, cooked medium rare, literally melts after one bite. 

As for the Jamon Iberico fried rice, I can certainly say that I was disappointed. Jamon Iberico naturally comes cured and is sliced thin and wide. Jamon Iberico should also melt in your mouth because of its marbling. When put on a grill and chopped up, the Jamon turns a bit chewy. The grilled Jamon is still of superior quality when compared to regular ham and I get that the whole point of grilling the Jamon is to extract the fat in order to make the fried rice just that much more savory and delicious. However, the end result is a bit lacking and I am not sure if the added taste to the dish makes up for the compromised texture of the Jamon.

As I was eating the fried rice, I decided to order a traditional Japanese garnish, takuan, to accompany my dish. It took a while for it to be served (~10 mins) and when served the takuan was of surprisingly poor quality. At a good Japanese restaurant you expect to be served takuan that is either off white or dark yellow in color. This takuan was bright yellow and cut way too thick. The most troubling thing about this is that takuan is used in sushi. It's simply unacceptable for a restaurant that touts its high quality food to serve such poor quality takuan. I understand that Nobu just opened, however their menu was just a big miss. The only circumstances under which I would recommend Nobu for now is if you are craving Wagyu and you are willing to pony up $280 for you and your guest(s) plus alcohol. Otherwise, forget it.",TFaOJ9089-P2hMBy2zR6-w,18,6,1,G9sQ9s_FotILWiy0unJuEg

Starting with the hostess who seemed to have a bad day not wanting to smile or communicate even simple pleasantries (e.g. Have a nice dinner, etc.). The server turned out to be pretentious going on about how this Nobu is special and trying to upsell to the chef's special dinner. The rest of the dinner the server was rather elusive often requiring us to ask others to get our server. The only upside on service was the bus person who was very personable and genuinely wanted to make a connection (thank him for getting two stars on the review).

The food, especially for the price, was on the disappointing for the most port. Notable exception was the tatake. The miso black cod was on the mushy side and not the flavor from other Nobus. Waygu gyoza had an off taste. Requested a special role with eel and could have gotten something better from a gas station.

4476248,2017-08-22,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Nobu was one of the biggest restaurant disappointments for us ever.

Why? Let me explain:

Nobu pretends to be a traditional Japanese restaurant with Peruvian flavors. However, in reality it embodies everything which is wrong with American hip ethnic restaurants. 

1. The food is simply not good. The seafood is only semi-fresh and definitely not at the quality level the price would suggest.
2. The flavors of EACH dish we had were totally overdone. Mostly the dishes were just over salted to the maximum. Others were super sour or too sweet. Japanese and Peruvian cuisines are known for preserving the distinct flavors of the ingredients - Nobu overpowered every single dish with the sauces and seasonings (yes even the sushi). The only dish which was okay was their signature black miso cod - but we definitely had better.
3. The service was ok but not great. Servers were rushed and didn't do a good job explaining their huge menu.
4. The interior of the restaurant feels like they are trying too hard to make it look ""cool and hip"". The setting inside is way too dark - I have seen 10+ guests using their cellphone lights to be able to read the menu.
5. Worst for my wife and me was that the quality of their ingredients were definitely way off. We are both very used to seafood and raw fish - but we both had terrible diarrhea right after the dinner.

Overall, Nobu felt like a Japanese version of the Cheese Cake Factory to us. A huge menu with okayish food but nothing is particularly good because they are trying too hard to appeal to the average American taste.

Definitely not coming back. Totally overhyped - there are WAY better options in Vegas at that price level.",iBNTPj_nGnZLVpeAzcy0lg,0,0,1,8axVYoIlCFcDggiqx_nIYg

My friend and I had intended to have dinner here before going to see Britney Spears, but it was a somewhat last minute decision so called around 5:30 pm to see how busy they would be at 7:00 pm. The hostess on the phone was rude and could not give me the slightest estimate on what the anticipated wait time for a 7pm on Saturday was. She quickly rushed me off the phone. 

We decided to try and go anyway, so we arrived and (I assume the same hostess) was SO RUDE. We were asking questions about wait times for seating at the bar and the sushi bar and she acted as if she did not want to give us the time of day. The wait for the sushi bar was 20 min so we decided to wait and grab a drink at the bar. 

Things got better. We ordered drinks and immediately a hostess arrived to take us to the sushi bar, so the bartender brought the drinks over to us. She was super nice, helpful, and the drinks were great (although it is difficult to mess up a dirty martini). 

The first sushi chef we had was quick and friendly, but not very chatty. We only ordered a few rolls because we were somewhat in a rush. I highly recommend the soft shell crab! The second chef we had was friendlier and funny. Our waiter was pleasant and attentive, however mostly unremarkable. 

From what I've heard about Nobu, I expected a better experience. It wasn't terrible, and I will update the review when I am able to go try more of the food selection, but I also didn't expect my best experience there to be with the bartender.

Now, my age has doubled and I still never thought I would get to try it.  My dad was here for NAB in April and in front of him, Eric R. surprised me: for my birthday we had a staycation reserved at Nobu Hotel and Nobu Restaurant!!!  I was beyond excited - supposedly we got ""preferential seating"" if we were hotel guests, but I never figured out what that meant.

The restaurant entrance is right next to the Nobu Hotel lobby, so it was easy to get dressed up and walk to the front.  We were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant, very close to another 2-top where we could easily hear the next party's conversation, so we were forced to chat with them sometimes.  Service was very slow, though our server was nice, we were surrounded by huge round tables with parties of 6 or more and it was hard for us to get his attention at all.  Eric R. had whiskey and 7, and I got the cracked basil cocktail with soju, yuzu juice, and pink peppercorns, tasty but tiny for $16.

Since this is a once-in-a-lifetime meal, we decided to order for ourselves rather than do Omakase.  The server suggested we do cold dishes, then hot, then sushi, then dessert.  We started with 2 cold dishes: yellowtail tartare with caviar, and beef new-style sashimi.  When the tartare arrived, it was doused in wasabi-soy dressing, very overpowering and not noted on the menu.  Eric was able to eat most of the top part that was not sitting in the dressing, and I ate the rest.  The server tried to convince us to order another one without sauce - no way!  The new style sashimi was amazing - thinly sliced beef topped with chive and sesame, seared by hot sesame oil accompanied by yuzu juice and soy.  It was so good that the ladies next to us then ordered it.

Our next course was hot: black cod miso and nasu (eggplant) miso.  They came together, perfectly flavored.  The cod was delicate and the eggplant skin crispy but soft inside.  Our third course, sushi, was ordered in 3 increments: toro scallion maki, nigiri: hamachi belly, salmon belly, scallop, saba with kelp, amaebi with fried head, ikura, fluke, uni, anago, big eye tuna, temaki: yellowtail jalapeno, negihama, salmon skin with avocado.  The big eye was sooo fatty and amazing.  All of it was amazing actually!  Fresh and delicate, served with tart yuzu soy.  Lastly, we ordered the banana harumaki for dessert (banana, dulce de leche in spring roll with passionfruit sauce) - it came out with a candle and Happy Birthday scripted in chocolate!

The next morning we did Nobu in-room dining for breakfast.  I had zosui (rice soup with tofu, mushroom, egg) and Eric R. had the breakfast okonomiyaki (with egg batter Osaka-style).  It was very good.  I really enjoyed my special birthday staycation meals and if I ever went back to Nobu I would sit at the sushi bar for sure!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,7,3,4,Zi-AHH_8OPaPwOKyGGfERw

To give you an idea of how pricey this place is, our food bill was $200 but the drinks and tip added another $200.  That would be easy enough to do, but we were not sitting around drinking ourselves under the table.  Between the three of us we had one glass of sake and four beers.  Five drinks, that is all!  Be careful if you decide to dine here.  You could very easily go broke, as it's one of the most expensive, if not THE most expensive, place I've ever been to.",kCvTBK9mbCrRBvB7jlr_cw,1,1,3,uzN-TibsXEt0M7tjLiB4dw
4597882,2017-07-31,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"This is literally going to be the hardest review I will ever write because this is LITERALLY THE BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. Let's put this into perspective: I've been to one of the best restaurants in the world, Le Bernardin in New York City, which is three Michelin Stars. So by definition, I have eaten at a world renowned restaurant (which up until now, was the best restaurant I have ever been to). Yet, Nobu is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. My uncle treated me, my best friend and boyfriend to an all expenses paid trip to Vegas, including dinner reservations to a couple amazing restaurants on the strip. When we arrived at Nobu, I was pretty tired from drinking (Vegas you know), so my friend and I waited to the side while my uncle and boyfriend got drinks at the bar. We were seated right on time at a regular table. Despite knowing that Nobu wasthe first to start Teppanyaki, we side-stepped the grill and went straight for the main menu. This is probably the best decision I have ever made in my life. We ordered so many dishes from all over the menu: yellowtail jalapeno, sashimi salad, wagyu beef tacos, miso black cod, teriyaki beef tenderloin, wagyu gyoza, shrimp and vegetables, toro roll and salmon roll. Before knowing anything about this restaurant, I thought of it like Sugarfish where the raw fish took center stage, but it was quite obvious that the hot dishes are the best things to order. Out of all of the things we ordred, we couldn't stop raving about the miso black cod and the beef tenderloin, mostly the cod though. We were talking about the black cod even after dinner the NEXT day AFTER eating at STK!!! This fish is really one of the best you can eat- its a really oily fish and my uncle says its very politically correct since they are raised in a very healthy, sustainable fishery lol. It is also referred to as a butterfish, which is what Roy's calls it if you've ever been there. The miso has the perfect amount of flavor and the fish just flakes off when you take a bite. In pictures it looks small but the portion size was very generous upon getting our plates! The Beef Tenderloin was cooked PERFECTLY medium, and even though the teriyaki was a little overpowering, the meat was prepared flawlessly. We only wish that the meat didn't come with any sauce at all because it really does speak for itself. Other honorable mentions are the wagyu tacos and yellowtail jalapeno. I'm not a big fan of yellowtail normally, but this particular fish and sauce were really delicious. Our family loves wagyu beef, so naturally we ordered a couple things with wagyu. These tacos had the perfect balance of textures, with the wonton shell and the tender, flavorful pieces of beef. The beef almost tasted like it was melting in your mouth! Being full Japansese myself, this place is definitely not traditional, but your server tells you that straight up. If you're looking for something that you'll find in Japan, you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for a restaurant that will blow you're freaking mind, THIS IS IT. Only complaint were the rolls - we thought that the fish would be whole but instead they were all chopped up which wasn't very impressive taste wise. Other than that, Nobu is a Japanese food experience of a lifetime, and one everyone should experience.",Du8505bNFN0UBORysdnVLA,1,0,5,4byj8Eq0ZXphDgvgtI6l1g

Warning: Sushi and Sashimi is so good, eating here will make it difficult to enjoy similar dishes anywhere else. 

I have made reservations and ate in the main dining room, however I prefer sitting at the sushi counter which is usually available by Walk in. 

Best Rolls we have had are when we keep an open mind and ask the sushi chef to prepare his favorite. 

I crave the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. They drizzle a citrus sauce on it that is to-die-for.

If you can sit on the far end of the sushi counter from the entrance, you may get the added entertainment of watching the Hibachi Chefs prepare at the private party Hibachi tables.

Good selection of unique cocktails, my favorite is the Lychee Martini.

I live in Seattle which has good sushi options but the best Sushi/Sashimi I have ever had is at Nobu. And the the fun and beautiful environment makes it a special experience.

4633721,2017-03-21,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"This is a really tough review to write because the food was absolutely outstanding but our waiter had the tackiest and most unprofessional approach to service I've ever witnessed.

We brought a client here for dinner on a Tuesday evening. Obviously, the evening is on our tab and we are well aware we are in a nice establishment. Our waiter asked if anyone had been to Nobu before, which some had. One key person - my boss, who was paying the bill - said he had been to multiple Nobus. Well, then the waiter proceeds to talk about how the menu can be a la carte or created as a tasting menu, and then went over pricing points, like, if we didn't want to have a nice, classy meal, we should do a la carte, but if we wanted to go above and beyond, tasting was the way to go.

AWKWARD. You never want to make a client feel like they can't order what they want, and you also never want to make them feel unimportant by, say, NOT ordering the tasting menu. 

We, of course, ordered the tasting menu.

Beyond that snafu, our waiter had way too many tables and wasn't quick enough with our requests or needs. We would have likely had another glass or two of wine but he never was around. We had to wave him down for the bill. Unacceptable at this price point for any of that to happen.

The tasting menu was good. A variety of options for everyone - even the two people in our party who don't eat raw fish (sigh.) However, when bringing out dishes for the other four people at the table that ARE raw fish, bring out an option for those two. At the same time. This didn't happen and they often sat and stared while we gobbled down heaps of sashimi and the like.

I will say, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno was one of the best things I've ever tasted. If it's possible for fish to melt in your mouth, this did it. I've never had anything so fresh and satisfying. And that was the first course.

But based on service alone, I wouldn't return to this place. Or, if I did, I'd sit at the bar or at a table with a friend - not a customer dinner where we are made to feel awkward and not waited on to the standard in which we should have been.",rCTVWx_Tws2jWi-K89iEyw,1,0,3,_HlTug5Qxac6ElDxeDxgvw

4663728,2013-12-16,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Short version: Very good food, very expensive. If you don't care about price (either you are rich, are splurging, or got comped), this is an awesome place to eat.

Long version:
It was my last night in Vegas and I decided to splurge. This is definitely an expensive place to eat. Get over it. 

The restaurant decoration is classy with several areas to choose from: the bar, the lounge, the sushi bar, and booths. There is a high ratio of waiter to customer. Most of the waiters are very conscious about what's happening on each of their tables and empty dishes are cleared within a minute. Some of the bust help were not as quick but that's understandable. Jonathan was my server and he was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes. He even know the proper Japanese names for the food and dishes. Impressive.

Now the food:
I had 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and some sushi.

The lobster taco and Wagyu taco were very good. The shells were deep fried gyoza wrapping. The lobster were steamed and the wagyu were grilled (I think). Topped with a variety of toppings, the bite size (literally 1 bite each) taco had great flavor.  Even though they were a bit small, even for appetizer. 3 star for this dish.

The second appetizer was the yellowtail with jalapeno. The fish was super fresh. I live in Hawaii and I know what fresh yellowtail taste like. This IS fresh. The ponzu sauce was light and did not overwhelm the dish. The thin slices of jalapeno made perfect compliment.  Each bite was a delight. 5 star for this. (Incidentally, a week later, I was back in Hawaii at Dash Gastropub and they had the same dish.  Let's just say it was good contrast.)

I had the black cod miso because I read so much about it. A good size piece of cod, marinated in miso, rinsed off, and grilled. The flavor was very good but it was strong so I had to order a bowl of rice ($5?!) to enjoy it fully. BTW, the ginger sprout garnish was a very good compliment.  I wish there were more than 2.  Even though it dish itself was very good ... but coming from Hawaii, we are used to eating miso butterfish. I can buy it marinated in the supermarket, take it home, rinse it off, grill it and it would have turned out to be exact same thing... for a fraction of the price. Value wise... I have ding it. 3 stars.

The pork belly kushiyaki with spicy miso is basically cubes of pork belly (meat and fat, not skin tho), skewered, grilled, have a spicy miso paste brushed on, grilled again, and served. The pork was very tender. The fat did not feel fatty, the miso was tasty and flavorful. This is a very good dish and I would eat it any day. 5 stars.  If I have to pick on something, it would be that it is quite heavy so you probably shouldn't eat more than 2 skewers.  Ladies should look at 1 per person.

After the 4 courses, I needed a little bit more so I ordered some sushi.

The anago and unagi were excellent. In fact, this is the first time ever I like the anago better than the unagi in any restaurant. 4 stars each.

The snow crab leg was decent. 3 stars.

The soft shell crab maki on the other hand was a disappointment. The roll was gummy and the crab was not pronounced at all. Not going to order it again.

There is no question that this place serves good food.  Majority of the dishes are very well done. The main issue here remains: value. Would I eat here again?  In a heartbeat, as long as I don't have to foot the bill. Maybe I'll pay if I have a gold digger girlfriend that I need to impress...",FvBCcfus6kIEEHp_MA-VtA,0,0,4,9wTWuOURWNT6O2Q_XZ0ROA

They put on the hockey game for us. 

I got the chef's omakase for $175 and it was worth every single cent and decadent morsel of goodness. 
It was nine courses. Seven cold and two hot. And I had about 14 different types of seafood - fish varieties and shellfish. Every single one was so tasty. Everything except two nigiri and the sample of yellowtail with jalapeño were off the menu so worth the customized experience. 

Splurge on the wagyu. It's like eating butter and succulent meat fat.  And at $38 an ounce it's really not that expensive because it's so filling and better to savor a little than gorge on a lot. 

My friends split a bottle of wine -$80 and it was really good. Semi sweet. Semi dry. 

I had 3 cocktails including the award winning purple rain. SO GOOD! I'm a big fan of sweet drinks that are aesthetically pleasing so I loved the huge blood orange (purple colored) ice cube. Mango passionfruit drink was also great and very sweet. The Peruvian caipirinha is perfect for people who like ginger beer and a slightly spicier profile.

I was in a very happy mood I had some deals going on with real estate and everything was going well. Buying and selling so I was kind of celebrating I was able to get some champagne that I liked and just sat by myself and I ordered two specific roles and they gave me free saki.

What made this a good dining experience was the way the dishes were served at the right temperature and appropriately timed to allow us to savor.  Cold dishes: the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeño @ $39 (for a party of 4) meant two very thin slices each.  They were overwhelmed by an overabundance of ponzu sauce making it difficult to appreciate the true freshness of the fish.  Three out of the four kinds of kelp salad (except the bland white variety) were tasty.  However, most were not completely cut creating a challenge and awkwardness in sharing the small portions.  Hot dishes: the black cod done 2 ways (miso and butter lettuce wrap) was both superb.  The shrimp & Maine lobster that came on a bedding of shiitake & oyster mushrooms in a slightly spicy lemon sauce was flavorful.  The sea bass tempura style turned out to be ball-size bites served in balsamic teriyaki sauce (oddly reminiscent of Palm Tree Inn lemon chicken) that hindered appreciation of the soft moist fish.  After watching ten sushi chefs hustling behind the counter we decided to check their output.  Our orders (bonito, tamago, yellowtail and mackerel) were not remarkable or extraordinary.

The biggest problem was the complete and utter gauging that was done to our group of 10. They saw ""expense account"" and decided to take us for every penny possible. Told us we could go only pre-fix and only have the most expensive items in insane quantities. We've had bigger groups at other Nobus (including Hard Rock) and never encountered anything like this. We wanted a few items that were not part of the set menu and were told we could only have them in addition. After five courses we were filling up and said we didn't want any more and were told that we couldn't eliminate anything - it was all pre-prepared. The sushi is pre-made?! I certainly hope not. At that point the sushi and dessert were still 3-4 courses away- yet we couldnt cancel any of it.
The amount of food was disgusting and absurd, and didn't live up to previous Nobu experiences in taste or quality. Many of the people serving us had no idea what they were bringing, what was still coming etc. 
It was likely over $500 per person and absolutely not worth it - over half was left uneaten, while they brought more and more food. It was absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating. What a horrible waste. They should be ashamed of themselves.

With locations all over the world that are frequented by celebrities, they obviously know what they're doing are, able to consistently provide a luxurious experience for guests, and have been able to scale that experience well. 

My girlfriend and I were finishing up a road trip with one night in Vegas, and after showing me Drake's instagram, convinced me that Nobu would be the place to try. 

She was right. To end our trip we got dressed up and showed up to the beautiful restaurant inside Caesar's. Amazing decor, everyone dressed to the nines, and five star service from start to finish.

We got two drinks each, and then split about 5 different dishes to share. I absolutely love seafood, so I was surprised that one of my favorite dishes of the night was the seared tofu skewers in a spicy chili sauce.

We ordered two rolls; the salmon and California if remember correctly. They were good but nothing to write home about. We also had the delicious shishito peppers.

The absolute best thing I ate that night was the Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Tosazu. It was simple, elegantly plated, barely seared, and resting in a light soy based sauce. It essentially melted in my mouth and immediately made me feel connected to the ocean, like they some how pulled this fish straight out of the water before they brought it to our table. If you're a lover of raw/fresh seafood you'll know what I mean.

4819198,2015-12-26,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Nobu is by far the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at in Las Vegas.  I consider myself a ""foodie"" in that I go anywhere and am willing to spend whatever for the best food and more importantly for the greatest service and experience available.   I travel to Vegas 5 or 6 times a year, I'm not a gambler or a big drinker, I come here for the food.  

Nobu specifically isn't bad food but at this price point it should be great food and a great experience.  The food is good at best but the service is terrible.  At first I thought it was just a random unlucky one off, but I now believe it's institutional here.  My waiter/server Matt, professed to be some sort of expert on the ""real"" Nobu experience.  In his opening remarks Matt offered to bring us through this experience, just let him know our comfort level based on price, things that we especially would love to eat as well as those that were a definite no way option and that he would create this culinary adventure and memory without comparison.  W ell this turned out to be true.

I told Matt that the price wasn't a problem, for me the only real no go was a texture thing.  I like sushi, I love great food and that I'm more of a Beef, Pork and Chicken person but would be open to whatever he recommended except the only ""No go"" for me would be slimly, gushy items.  The first thing he brought out was a yellowtail jalapeno dish.  Flavor?  Good, texture?  Terrible.  Matt asked what we thought, I told him that it had ""good flavor"" but failed on the texture scale and that it was exactly what I said I didn't want.  The next dish was almost the exact same thing only with some shaved almonds on it for ""texture"".  I made the same complaint.  Third dish, a Crab Ceviche on a bib lettuce cup. Okay now, I'd about had it, I took Matt aside and told him that he asked me what was a total no go for me and them proceeded to bring me three dishes in that category. I also told him I was able to somewhat muscle through these dishes, but if he noticed I didn't finish any of the dishes he brought out and that at nearly $300 per person, ""I do not want to muscle through my meal, I want to be able to sit back and truly enjoy it.""  I pointed out each of the three times he visited my table that other people around me were eating appetizing dishes and that he hadn't been even close.

He then brought out a very good Sea Bass dish followed by a Wagu Beef dish that was excellent and then a tempura crab that was sub par at best and a chocolate lave cake with ice cream that was  so over cooked there was no lava and the edges were ""Hard"".  Overall the meal was $650.00.  Matt did not offer to remove any of the poor choice dishes, he didn't offer to buy us a drink and a manager of chef didn't stop by.  Nothing.

I am not a rearview mirror kind of guy and don't spend time fretting over things that already happened.  But this one bother me so much so that the next day I stopped by the restaurant to express my views about what happened.  I was promised that someone would call me in the middle of the day.  No one called, no one actually cares here and that is why waiters like Matt work there.  My advice, don't go, take your $650.00 and drop it in the machines.",b7w3uZZSa24htk58ZtfFiA,2,0,1,zkbLcpN4fa8I-ZnV60h6Lw

4830971,2016-01-11,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"This restaurant helped turned me in to a sushi and restaurant snob! The food itself deserves five stars but despite how many workers they have, service was very slow and bad! I have been to Nobu in Malibu, California which had amazing service so I was expecting the same but unfortunately I did not have the same experience here.

Food Recommendations:


1.) YellowTail Sashimi with Jalapeños ($28) in Yuzu sauce. This is by far the freshest and best tasting yellowtail I have ever eaten! The Yuzu sauce is quite zesty, the jalapeño adds a little kick of spice and the yellowtail sort of just melts in your mouth. 
2.) Rock Shrimp ($24) available in Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeño. We ordered all three bit fell in love with the creamy spicy! The only way I can explain this to you is like Shrimp Tempura meets Walnut Shrimp in heaven and had a baby! This is a must try!
3.) Wagyu Beef ($26 per ounce- 2 ounce minimum) choice of Hibachi (grilled- seared quickly served with dipping sauces), Shabu Shabu (meat submerged in a pot of dashi) or sukiyaki (slowly simmered in an iron pot). No matter how you cook it this meat is top grade, tender and amazing.
4.) Chilean Seabass ($48)- although it's not the best Seabass on the strip (Noodles at Bellagio) it's cooked comparable well here.

4848123,2013-03-12,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Nobu has it all - celebrity guests, a famous name, wonderful food and a HUGE price point.  

We had a group of 10 that included family and friends, so instead of ordering a la carte we went with the Nobu Signature option on the Omakase menu, where the chefs craft a custom menu in real time based on our group's expressed preferences, allergies, etc. The price per person was big but since it was basically all-in and we were there for a special visit, why not. 

The food was 5 stars. The miso cod was fantastic, the wagyu beef tacos were amazing, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños were divine, the grilled premium Japan wagyu beef was delicious and the dessert assortment they brought out was one for the ages. Best bite of the night was the first one - the salmon tartare topped with caviar in a wasabi soy broth with a mystery berry of some unknown origin (unknown to me) on the side - that dish was superlative-worthy on its own.  I didn't love our shrimp dish, but that good was far outweighed by a whole lot of great. 

The cost ended up being crazy high.  My buddy handled the accounting but what I think happened was that on top of the Omakase went the pre-order appetizer and the cocktails. And when the server suggested the sake that she said paired great with the desserts, we didn't realize it apparently wasn't part of the prix fixe menu.  Either that or there was some sort of misunderstanding.

No regrets. Had a wonderful, truly memorable meal with a great group.  Worth (almost) every penny.",Uwlm6u10dSFvYSpppbehAg,4,1,4,T4HzQ8MpQISSFZuG6Vv1Dg
4852473,2018-01-16,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"I think this spot is a little overhyped, but i also had the worse hostess experience ever here. Arrived at 8:03pm for our 8pm reservation and were told the party before was taking awhile on desserts - poor seating planning in my mind. Then after 15 minutes, we asked the same hostess what's taking so long still and she said she would speak to her manager. Another 15 minutes passed and haven't seen her call or speak to a single manager.. she just stood at her counter picking up calls and looking at her computer screen. Others in my party of 5 got frustrated and asked again what was taking so long and she said she will ask her manager, again. Finally, we just found another hostess to ask. We decided to take the regular seating when we initially booked for teppanyaki. Even ordering a beer at the bar took my friend 15 minutes, which was a little ridiculous how slow and poor service is. After being seated we ordered appetizers and still tried to make our teppanyaki seating happen. Finally, we were approached by another worker saying the seats are opened for teppanyaki. We moved our seats and sat around a grill that had extra 5 seatings and the table next to us had another extra 5 seatings...which super disappointed us that we couldn't have been seated in these seats earlier. I would've given this spot 2 stars based on our first hour here, but the wonderful waitress and bus-person for our table were super friendly and accommodating. Our chef was also super friendly and welcoming. This reminds me lots of Benihana but the food tasted a bit better. We had a few appetizers, drinks, first 3 teppanyaki sets to share and dessert.

- Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño: too much sauce that covered the actual taste of the fish. Sauce was a little too salty for me.
- Lobster & Tuna mini tacos: this was just a one-bite and it came with two of each so it wasn't enough for the group. I had some of the tuna and thought it was ok, the taco skins were too thick, would've been nicer thinner to not mask the original flavor of the fish.
- Mixed seafood ceviche: this was yummy with so many options inside with a good amount of citrus so it doesn't overpower.
- Whitefish on chips: forgot the name of this order since my coworker ordered it. The presentation was beautiful! But the orange sauce above my fish was too much yet again.
- Lychee, Mango mocktail: delicious! Would totally order again.
- Shishito pepper: always a yummy choice!
- Edamame: always a good choice for starters too & perfect amount of sea salt on top.
- Tuna tartare: literally one small spoon bite per person - wish portions were better for larger groups.
- Salmon & Tuna sashimi with lettuce wrapped in daikon: not bad, fresh fish.
- Black Cod Miso: This is what they're known for & it's definitely as good as people say. Definitely order this!

As for the rest of the meal, it was in the first 3 Teppanyaki sets. Portions were small, but we were left filled because of all the stuff we ordered. My favorite of all these dishes is the A5 Wagyu & steak - cooked to soft perfection & melts in your mouth! The sauces were also yummy, especially the truffle one :p For desserts, we ended with the chocolate lava cake that my boss loved, and I loved the green tea ice cream paired with it. The ice cream mochis were also delicious! Overall, hostess service sucked and it ruined a lot of the experience, but the waitress for our table was awesome, food was ok - small portions & a bit overpriced, but won't be returning.",sTW0gS1reTlPhrZYCDKH7A,2,2,3,-GamsweUAmD1hwMKtl4FlA

Anticucho, as explained by our server, is Peruvian chili that Chef Nobu began to use for his cooking back in his days in Peru. It had very unique flavors, and we both loved it. Next item on agenda was Nobu's famous black cod miso, which was outstanding! I'm usually not a big fan of broiled fish, but miso-glazed black cod certainly changed my perspective on that. In To top it all off, we had beef tobanyaki, which is beef tenderloin cooked in a stone pot with mixed mushrooms and vegetables. This was certainly the highlight of the meal, as tenderloin was cooked so perfectly and sauces used complemented the tenderloin so well.

I can say dining at Nobu was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I'll certainly be back.",5PhGjB3gaWXgdOjZb3UyGA,2,1,5,AozOAkm1TpHcqNrp5LFlfA

I love plates of sashimi with sauce on it so that's mostly what I ordered

- white fish 
- salmon
- yellowtail
- black cod 
- uni
- oysters
- wagyu beef tataki

the dishes were amazing! very fresh and the texture was buttery and super good.  I loved all the sashimi dishes

the uni was cold and tasted really fresh. must get! $10

my other favorite fish was the salmon.  the texture was like butter and the brown sauce it came with went great with it

the white fish was also good.  the sauce was very lemony

yellowtail was great also but it's just with ponzu sauce so nothing special

the wagyu beef was also very good! it was lightly seared beef thinly cut and served cold.  I think I would prefer it served warm or hot but I guess.  they put some ponzu sauce on it

also tried a roll for the hell of it.  the waiter said the house roll was popular.  I did not like it at all.  the white wrapping it came with was good though. I like anything besides the regular seaweed wrap",3CHJk5k323U6UZ-MKVkTdw,2,0,5,bR0nbNu_BuroRas8hpi4Yg

We shared a dessert which was plenty and paired our dinner with a wonderful CA sauvignon blanc.

I would recommend this place as a splurge to dress up and taste some very fresh and delicate plates. This was great for a business dinner, would be for a date or a group.

4958347,2017-05-21,3,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"The teppan table at Nobu was one of the top 3 or 4 meals of my life.  We had a 7 pm reservation on a Friday night.  This was the 5th time my buddy and I had reserved the teppan table.  The previous 4 we had been bumped for high rollers, so I was wondering if we would even get the table at all.  Fortunately for us, we did. 

There are 2 teppan tables in Nobu with 8 seats each.  There were only 4 of us and no one joined us, so we were able to spread out and all had a good view of the chef.  The tables are kind of separated from the restaurant, so it's a much more intimate feel.  When we left, I was surprised to see a completely full restaurant buzzing with activity, that's how isolated you are from the regular dining room.
 
Our server (Andrew, who was fantastic) explained the menu to us.  They offer ala carte ordering, but like most teppan joints you've been to, most people chose a tasting menu.  They have several levels:  $125, $155, $190, $280 and the reasonable $688, which is a wagyu tasting menu that must be ordered in advance.  Given how good our meal was, I can only imagine how the $688 would be.  I am sure on my next trip to Vegas I'll hit a progressive and try it.  Our table of 4 decided on the $190 menu, but with crab fried rice instead of chicken fried rice.  Additionally, 3 in our party added a seared foie gras bun, which was $50.

The wine list at Nobu is solid for Vegas.  The somm was great, we ordered a magnum of cab and when he didn't have the bottle, he offered us 2 bottles of a better vintage for the same price.  What Nobu does have is (as expected) a great Japanese whiskey selection.  2 of us went with the $40 flight and I am very glad I did.  All 3 whiskeys were fantastic, and it got me curious about Japanese whiskeys, which have been receiving high praise for some time now.

I don't think I have enough room in this review to adequately describe every dish, so I will give you what we had and then highlight a few items.  This is what the $190 tasting menu came with at our visit:  blistered Shishito, Yellowtail Tartare, Sashimi Salad, Japanese Scallop, Chilean Seabass, Japanese Wagyu, King Crab Tempura, Scallop in Cilantro Sauce, crab fried rice (usually chicken) and a coffee flavored dessert with whiskey foam.

The Japanese wagyu was my favorite of the evening, and the second best steak I've had in my life (after the riserve ribeye at Carnevino for those keeping score at home).  It was filled with veins of fat that melted into flavor during cooking.  It is served with 3 sauces, but I only tried 2 of them and didn't use them during the meal.  The steak is too good to mask with sauce, even sauces as good as these.  Additionally, it is served with an asparagus and mushroom salad, soy salt, and fried garlic.  The fried garlic was fantastic (it's the stuff that looks like tiny cornflakes in the picture).  I had every intention of copying this at home, until I found out that the process takes over 24 hours.  I could eat a full bowl of this stuff.  A bite of the steak with fried garlic and some soy salt was the best bite of my 4 nights in Las Vegas.  To be honest, probably one of the better bites of my life.

I don't know if a $50 3 bite sandwich can be called a bargain, but the seared foie gras was.  Of course it's ridiculously expensive, that's the markup you pay for eating on the Las Vegas strip at an iconic Japanese restaurant.  However, the foie gras is also fantastic quality.  The sear adds only a slight crust to the exterior, the foie gras is left with that great umami flavor and mouth feel.  I absolutely would get this again and highly recommend you do the same.

The chilean seabass was cooked perfectly and served in a balsamic teriyaki sauce that was sweet & syrupy but not too heavy.  I could have just ordered a large filet of this fish and been very satisfied with my meal.

The crab fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was served toward the end of the meal, which was new to me.  I devoured this stuff, I could have eaten another bowl, and this was after all of the food we had already eaten.  It had some nice heat, everything was prepared well, and the seasoning was spot on.  If you don't get this with your tasting menu, I would say it's well worth it for the table to add it ala carte.  

The yellowtail tartare was another table favorite.  Served with caviar in a fantastic sauce (you get so much stuff it's hard to keep track and remember what everything was, so all I know about this sauce is I like it), it was tartare of the highest quality.  The surprising dish for me was the king crab tempura.  Light but with a great tempura crunch, this was a fantastic dish.

I liked everything, but a couple of the dishes had too much cilantro for my preference.  But, that was the only thing I could nitpick about in my entire meal at Nobu.

Finally, I cannot think of a meal more appropriate to act as my 900th review than the teppan table at Nobu.  I hope I am back very soon.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,4,5,hgcXc8RMwDK3BLa-RiKVUA

The sake was served in glasses on a bed of salt.  The visual presentation was very appealing, and the sake was very smooth.  We told the waitress what we liked and she basically picked the food menu for us.  But, we specifically asked for the yellowtail jalapeno.  And, that was a melt in your mouth experience.  You must add a bit of the cilantro to each bite to get the complex flavors and texture.  

We had butter fish and surf and turf (beware, super expensive) and when they lit the beef on fire over the stones at the table, it was nothing short of FUN!  The meat texture was so tender.  Both the steak and lobster were served with a distinct, flavorful sauce, and the pickles on the plate were soooo yummy.  Who knew pickles blended well with lobster?

Monkfish pâté topped with caviar was my first on my list.Creamy,smooth,fatty with a slight metallic finish but adding the caviar masked the metallic taste some people don't like.Shrimp and Maine lobster with spicy lemon was my next endeavor.Just like the fireworks light up the Fourth of July,this plate had the same effect on my tastebuds.The lobster was firm,white and opaque,accompanied by the shrimp that had a very firm and crisp texture with the spicy lemon sauce that was drizzled on top,oh mother it's perfect.Half coconut Haupia was the perfect ending.The coconut was warm,supple with mixed berries on a path of light brown sugar crumbs.When the plate came out I didn't think it would work but the flavors married really well.

This definitely is a five star restaurant but I had a slight problem with the caviar which could of been of better grade for the price I was paying.Also our server was real snobby and had the body language of I don't want to serve you cause you don't look like high rollers.Hopefully management fixes some of the attitudes here especially the hostesses who check you up and down when you walk up,whaaat.

Price = Expensive. I can't get over that they charged us (a lot!) for water.. 

Service = blah. 

For such a nice restaurant, we should have been treated with a bit more respect. It was really only our waiter that annoyed me-- all other staff were kind.

Basically, I felt as if he was talking down to us-- like we didn't know a thing about what we wanted to eat. I was particularly offended, since we eat sushi very regularly, AND he was a younger non-Asian guy who apparently couldn't be bothered to shave and be presentable that day. 

He also kept pressuring us to order more expensive things. With kids at the table, we wanted to order shrimp + vegetable tempura-- but before we could finish the order, he goes on and on about the lobster tempura, cutting us off. But we order shrimp + vegetable anyway and he give us a dirty look like we're cheap. 

-____________________________-

Overall, he just seemed like he didn't want to be there, and thought that he was above us. The other waiters were so nice.. We just HAD to be stuck with that guy. I don't care how much he knows about sushi-- he could have been a tuna fish himself for all I care, but customers should always be treated with kindness and respect.

I sat at the sushi bar and only had sushi.  The sushi chef was cordial, but not overly friendly.  I had the feeling that this was more of a sushi factory (albeit a high quality factory) than a high quality sushi experience.

- The amberjack was amazing.  Full of flavor.  I've never had amberjack that had this much richness with just a hint of fishiness
- The toro was nice and fatty.  Not quite as fatty as I would expect, but still very nice
- The aji was average.  I've had much better elsewhere
- The live octopus was seriously the best octopus I've ever had.  Just wow.  Why do other sushi places even serve that purple octopus jerky?
- The golden eyed snapper was rich and full of flavor.  Not something you usually get with snapper
- The Santa Barbara uni was Santa Barbara uni.  Smooth, sweet, and creamy
- The flying fish was ok.  Unique fish, but not a unique flavor
- The Japanese barracuda was meaty and fishy.  I enjoyed it
- The jumbo clam, which I'm not a huge fan of, was better than average.  I only had to chew 32 times instead of 50.  It also had more flavor than cardboard

5011491,2014-06-23,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"If I could I would give our March 2014 meal at Nobu @ Caesar's Palace 0 stars for service and 4 stars for food; 2 stars is my compromise. The exceptionally high prices are a given. Our lunch for 4 cost $500, and we weren't too full to skip dinner. The food, in general, was very tasty. Surprising standouts included the shishito peppers and the spicy miso chips with big eye tuna. The kumamoto oysters were shockingly disappointing; without the salsa toppings, they would have been completely flavorless. The black miso cod was also disappointing, probably because it was not as warm as it could have been. Which leads me to the real problem with the meal--the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was exceedingly condescending from the get-go. Beyond that, he spoke way too fast (and this was the consensus from 3 New Yorkers) while also failing to enunciate. He arrived at the table with way too much attitude and launched into his poorly delivered spiel despite our telling him that one of our party of four was in the rest room. When that person returned, he was less than willing to fill her in on what she'd missed. Ryan kept wanting us to let him design our menu, but since my preference would have been to see him fired on the spot, I was not inclined to let him choose our food. I cannot overemphasize how much undeserved attitude Ryan was dishing out. Our group had never seen anything like it, and between the four of us, we have eaten in great restaurants around the globe. Beyond the service problem of Ryan himself, we were also quite unhappy about the tremendous speed with which each course arrived at the table and the equally swift way in which even not yet finished plates were whisked away. One could either eat one's food as quickly as possible, without having the opportunity to savor it, or let it sit on the table, growing cold, as my black cod did. I've had significantly slower fast food. In general, I don't like to rate the quality of a restaurant based on its service rather than its food, but in this case, the horrendous service made the food much less palatable.

5047330,2014-07-24,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"This should be a 3.5 star restaurant (when adjusted by price). The service is great (just like Sushisamba's) and they take care of you very fast. The waiter was the best waiter I've had so far. He was a trainee as I could see someone shadowing him and giving him prompts. He was really nice, explained to us how this restaurant was Peruvian influenced Japanese food. I did not say that I was Peruvian myself (not sure if this would have made a difference).

It is very expensive but I guess that is not a surprise. Anyways, we came here due to Groupon. They had a pretty good 5 course meal for $95. I will (want) to assume that this made no difference as to how the meal was prepared for us. 

It started with Edamame, which was pretty good. It had rocky salts all over it which made it taste way better than just plain old edamame. This dish I've seen in different versions in different japanese restaurants so it was not something new.

The second dish was I think 6 pieces of sushi and a california roll. The sashimi was meh I didn't feel it was specially good or bad, just ok. Nothing melted in my mouth. Also, the california roll was the only reason why I was not super hungry at the end. Since it was given to us second, then by the end of the meal metabolism had done its share.

The third dish was (the famous) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño sauce. In my opinion it was really good. As a Peruvian, I am used to eating ceviche and tiradito. This obviously is more similar to a tiradito but the sauce had an extra kick that I loved. It was really good. If I had to go back here, I would only order this and leave.

The fourth dish was (the also famous) black cod miso. I liked it a lot. Tasted really great and I liked the sweet flavor. Now, it is probably true that if I did not know that this dish was so big I would have probably said it was excellent. I just had higher expectations as to what a great dish should be like. 

Last dish was desert. The brought us the bento box. I liked the flourless cake and something that came in a capuccino cup.

Great meal overall, I felt like I was in a great restaurant but I feel it is slightly overrated. The waiter kept asking everytime about how great the food was. I guess they just expected us to clap right after eating a bite of something.

Having to get out of the way of staff while they are walking and dodging staff walking backwards is not the attention to detail I expect. Also, asking if the seating is desirable for the party or desire to seat elsewhere is good etiquette (having been seated in the middle of a near empty restaurant, when better seating is available). Finally, the waiter made a point to talk about the fusion of Japonessa and Peruano cuisine... besides the one line of ceviche, not much of a nod to Peru.

My girlfriend and I didn't really get to test the entire experience, because the experience from the beginning was a bit off.

Our server made us feel rushed. He had understood that we have been to other Nobu locations before, but didn't make for an experience worth repating. 

We ordered some of the traditional dishes along with the traditional mango passion fruit martini, and was disappointed with everything. Not saying that anything was bad, it just wasn't up to the standards that this brand has built us up to.

It would be difficult for me to return to this location, but I will not stray away from the the other Nobu's I've been to in the past.",sL7MPuc4HXfYKQCnJMy9Bw,3,0,1,p0r0q4AvrpFLY3pH82WSPg

The server informed me this particular Nobu was doing a special family style Omakase to celebrate Caesars 50th anniversary.  I ordered the Nobu sidecar whiskey cocktail which was a perfect way to start the meal.  They served the cold dishes first, and unlike the other omakase meals there wasn't a pallet cleanser and neither was there a soup.  All things aside it was the wonderful meal as you would expect for $250 a head.  The A5 Kobe beef served over hot stones was excellent as well as the sea bass.

5121388,2016-09-05,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Executive Summary: One of the best Japanese restaurants in the world!

Value (Price/Quality): Good - price is expensive, but quality is outstanding. 

Customer Service: Good, but needs improvement. I've been to other Nobu locations in the world and the service at this location is very sub-standard compared to their Monaco and Hong Kong locations. Especially since this is Las Vegas and America, these waiters, bus boys, and hostess need to earn it. Service at their global locations far more superior. 

You'll like this place if: If you appreciate Tasting Menus, been to Japan, like baller places or have a global taste palate. 

Don't go here if: If you eat California Rolls or think Panda Express is Japanese food.

Transportation: No parking. Limited Street parking, Ample bike parking. Limited parkades in the area. Best to walk. Public Transit only on Bathurst or Spadina streetcars

Tip: Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and Black Cod Miso are the must trys! I also got the wagyu beef tacos. The peppers is a tastier option than classic edamame. Currently they offer a $50 USD bento box for the Caesar's Palace 50th Anniversary promotion. 

The Good, Bad and Ugly Details: If got $200 USD+ budget do the tasting menu. Otherwise, you are robbing yourself of an experience. Skip the Vegas buffet and come here or just don't gamble your life away and spend it here where you know you won't be disappointed. 

Yelp Customer Bottom Line: If you made it this far to read my review, count your pennies and save up to come here if you don't anticipate on visiting any other Nobu locations near you.

Business Opportunity: Step up the customer service. Especially considering the brand is part of the Nobu Hotel, it should be a seamless guest experience from the moment a guest books a reservation to paying a bill. Take a learning from Shangri-La Hotels guest services for their diamond members.",uDTzyoc7b332tjVzxARGZQ,0,0,5,dIejxdcydwF7WpNHtxx2WQ
5131382,2015-01-03,3,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Ordered the $300 per person NYE omakase. Aside form this ridiculous price, I would say that unless you're really really curious, don't do it. Nobu is a celebrity hot spot and not exactly affordable or worth it to us common folk. You can get a better omakase for a lot cheaper without the Nobu name. 

Food wise, everything from start to finish had some kind of unnecessary add on or detail that made it exquisite. Most of it just tasted like ceviche haha but honestly the plating and the service and the experience was pretty impressive, but as for the food like I said you're not paying the $ just for food but also for the presentation.

Omakase included a few items not usually available to the general public such as the endangered blue fin tuna.

You have the option to have the waiter order all of the courses for you rather than picking from the menu, which is exactly what we did.

It was my first taste of interesting flavor in Las Vegas. I started with the lobster ceviche. I was expecting a bowl of lobster served with nacho chips. Reckon I'm basic. But no. Nobu's ceviche was served on lettuce. Heavily citrus flavored, but not overwhelming. My friend had shrimp and lobster with mushrooms. The mushrooms were so tasty, there she was devouring them in favor of the lobster and shrimp. There's hope for veganism after all. What the Health?!?!? My steamed sea bass was interesting as well. The dry miso chips on top stole the show. I was not a fan of the green tea ice cream.

All that taken into account, I like a well oiled machine and Nobu is. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, personable, and prompt. When Nobu could've been stuffy and pretentious, it was an old friend putting you onto something new. I was impressed that the person keeping our water full knew the intricacies of the menu.

We were seated right away, which was great, and looked over the menu while soaking in the cool modern artsy asian ambiance. 

Good thing we weren't that hungry, otherwise the damage would've been greater. We got an order of their Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer, two orders of the Black Cod Miso with the lettuce cup preparation for easier sharing, and Beef skewers with the Anticucho sauce. I THINK we also got the chicken skewers too but now I can't remember. At any rate, everything was delicious; I'm not saying anything was bad, but we each ended up paying almost $50 (with tax and tip) for these little nibblies. The worst was the black cod miso--you get three measly bites per order, so that was $68 for two bites/per person, wow. 

Maybe I'm a Philistine when it comes to fine dining, but this stuck in my craw (har har).

The atmosphere is trendy, hostesses are sexy, and the room is filled with excitement when you enter. We were there to sit back, spend some of our winnings, and have some laughs. 

Two of us ordered the Chefs special - which was $175 a person. We were expecting to be wowed, but quickly realized this was nothing more than a gimmick to lure unsuspecting Vegas tourists. Several of the fish pieces contained bone or were not fresh. I sent it back, but only after having to haggle with the server. While they were ultimately appologetic, it was clearly not genuine. We kind of felt that everything was prepared with haste and mass production in mind. 

Also, the Chefs special comes out in several courses - ideal for a relaxing time. My only issue with this is that it took more than two hours for our meals to be completed - after our other guests had completed their meals.

When we spoke with the manager about it later, she said the cashier had run the gift card without checking to see what the table check balance was, and apparently told the server that everything was taken care of. In this day and age, with electronic table ordering and such, I do not believe that neither the cashier nor the server would have been aware of the large discrepancy.

The sushi and sashimi come in very little pieces so expect to order a lot of orders.   My wife had the Hot spicy crab which she enjoyed.    The atmosphere is nice and very relaxed.   The only downfall was the waiter was trying to sell us on different dishes.   We know our sushi and the most of the food that was on the menu so be careful.

Nasu miso was pretty good, and the sashimi and nigiri were average. The mackerel was probably my favorite, followed by the shrimp and salmon, but honestly, all I could think about was how we could have gotten this at a lower-end restaurant, and it would have all been the same.

We decided to order one more thing to see if Nobu could redeem itself, so we got a simple spicy scallop roll. BINGO! It was great. The nori was delicious, and so was the spicy scallop. Together, it was perfect. 

I wish we had ordered more rolls, but we were way too stuffed. I'll definitely come back to Nobu, but I recommend getting their rolls rather than sashimi/nigiri.",4D90YMyPxBtPbIpodbBmeg,2,0,3,GOWFeiIb9Vo0sujw7eHusg

AN and I were in Vegas on business and we have a little tradition, we always have pizza and sushi where ever we go! So while looking for the best sushi in Vegas I kept hearing NOBU!  We made reservations for 8:00pm and our driver dropped us right at the door at Ceasers, when we walked into Nobu it looked amazing, you could see the sushi bar with the sushi chefs working, the ambiance just felt trendy and modern with an upbeat energy.  We were quickly seated and our hostess looked at me as I sat down, she could tell right away I was not happy with our table, she asked if everything was ok, it was not, and I asked if we could have another table, and I  told her where we would like to sit, she informed me it would be another 15 minutes but quickly informed us she would escort us to the bar and make sure we were taken care of and get us the table I wanted.  9 minutes later the hostess was back to the bar with a waiter to bring our drinks from the bar to our table and our hostess escorted us right to the table I requested.  Our waiter promptly arrived taking our drink order of a bottle of water chilled and another glass of wine for AN.  He went over the whole menu answering all our questions and asking us what interested us and what stuck out, AN and I told our waiter what we were interested in from the menu and he asked if he could make some suggestions one of which being Omakase where you allow the chefs to custom create a full NOBU experience!  AN and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a word we both knew we were going with that amazing experience!  When the first plate came out of yellowtail sushi with caviar and 14 karat gold shavings I knew we made the right choice, and plate after plate of the most amazing food experiences we've had in a long time came out, sushi and Wagyu beef flambéed table side for 37 seconds.  It was an amazing experience!  The waiter does ask you a few questions before hand if you go with Omakase because our meal for the two of us before tip was over $800.00 but that's part of the questions to inform you of what the cost is.  This evening was amazing from the food experience to our amazing waiter, the ambiance was perfect and Nobu at Ceasers Palace Las Vegas is another favorite, we will come here again and I highly recommend Nobu!",cRH9xN5ybcgJ-p0f02bACg,0,0,5,3lQvR_e2X1lZnXS4kTH3Qg

This is an overpriced, low-quality, fancy Panda Express (sorry Panda no offense) restaurant and I have dined at plenty of good restaurants in LV, including Gordon Ramsey Steak, Bazaar Meat, Cut, Fleur, Bouchon, etc.

We came to Nobu with high expectations and ordered quite a few items between me and my friend who came from overseas to visit.

Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno -- Very sour and sweet, and the ponzu sauce completely overpowered the yellowtail.

Spicy Miso Chips with Scallops -- ok.

Kumamoto Oyster with Nobu Sauce -- ponzu sauce again.... really? 

Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy -- tasted like bar food, nothing special, yeah, the sauce was sweet.

Black Cod Miso -- another sweet dish, omg.

Uni sushi -- not fresh, the uni tasted blend.

Yellowtail belly sushi -- ok.

Toro handroll & Spicy yellowtail handroll -- i found tendon inside my toro handroll, I ordered a toro handroll not a ""leftover fish handroll""

Our waiter was attentive and nice initially.  However when we expressed our disappointment because all the dishes were sweet and soaked into ponzu sauce, he immediately changed his attitude 180 degrees.  He made us feel like it was our fault in ordering the wrong items!  In stead of turning our disappointment into a memorable experience, the waiter said, "" you should tell me you guys prefer the savory dishes, not sweet dishes.,"" Well, I'm sorry, Mr Waiter, we chose the dishes from the main menu, not the dessert menu. We simply didn't expect most of the dishes to be on the sweet side.   How does one come to expect miso, nobu sauce, cream spicy sauce to be all made out of the same ponzu sauce? Is this the Nobu experience??!?!?!

New Men Ramen - A pork flavored broth with succulent, tender char siu pieces, the only downside to this dish was the noodles were slightly over-cooked.  I prefer a firmer noodle, which Daikokuya nails anyday

What we ordered:
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño (4 stars): I think this dish was well plated, really simple and delicate. The jalapeno complimented the flavors of the yellowtail well, a good hot substitute for wasabi. I would never think to pair the two, but the flavors really merged well.
Nobu Sashimi Tacos (4 stars): We ordered 4 tuna, 2 salmon, and 2 lobster. I think all were really  tasty. The shrimp cracker like shell made each bite crunchy and delicious! I recommend the tuna and lobster.
Broiled Alaskan Black Cod with Miso (3 stars): I'm not going to lie...I was underwhelmed. Yes, the texture of the fish is melt-in-your-mouth soft and flaky but the flavors didn't wow me. Tasted awfully similar to the miso my mother made when I was growing up. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary considering Nobu is ""Japanese with Peruvian flair.""

The service at this location was shocking. We were treated rudely. We waited and waited for our waiter. 
This location obviously is very touristy but that doesn't mean you can charge the earth serve up second rate Nobu quality food and then be treated like a criminal for saying something about it. We honestly felt ripped off and that is no way a customer should feel in a restaurant they know so well. The Famous yellowtail and jalapeño at $32 a pop was close to the original recipe but was not right on the mark as I believe it should be considering it is such a trademark dish. THIS was the only dish close to the mark. The sushi was close but not up to par the rest was a miserable miserable effort.
The gentleman serving up the miso soup in plastic cups trying to explain how to drink or I should say eat the soup was absurd. Obviously sushi 101 here at the lackluster location at Caesars Palace. 
Despite the fact that you have tourist customers unaware of the legacy of this cuisine does not mean that you can treat them like cattle and serve up half ass nonchalant non-caring attempts with severity of attitude to the extent of personal insult. 
At these prices we customers honestly deserve better than that - we entered the establishment in a jovial mood and left completely stunned and angry.
The tables on both sides of us who we struck up conversation with both agreed that what they were experiencing was totally unacceptable. As a matter-of-fact the table to our right we made friends with left their meal early to go eat somewhere else!
It's not very often that I feel as though a meal should have been comped in other words we shouldn't have had to pay however... I will warn people not to go to this location and if they do they should expect to be ripped off. The waiter we had was probably the worst I have ever had in my life which says a lot considering I've been all over the world and have eaten at restaurants in all corners of this globe!

$12 Yellowtail Jalapeno Roll

I would try this place again to see if their other famous choices lived up to the hype, because honestly, the Black Cod Miso was not to my taste. I could tell the fish was very well-cooked, the way the flesh slid perfectly along its grain (pardon any incorrect nouns), but whatever umami moment I was supposed to be having, I was not. The same happened with the wagyu-beef. The flavor was very similar to an iron-plate steak I had before, an off-shoot of gravy with a stronger taste of onion. Anyways, didn't like it. What I ended up eating was the house special roll. It was like a rainbow roll, but with the assortment of fishes on the inside and the outside wrapped in a crunchy radish paper. Pretty good, but if I was going to get $20 sushi, I would rather go to Maestro's. Their rolls are more than good, they're awesome. 

The best thing I had there was the ice cream: hojicha, matcha, and avocado. They had some weirder flavors like bubble gum, banana, and peach cobbler. The ice cream was smooth, silky, and creamy. Plus, the tea-flavored ice creams were spot on. 

Service
======
A little on the slow side. We had to request extra wasabi three times before it got delivered. Same with asking for the menu to add on items. It took a good ten minutes, and I was severely tempted to go grab a menu myself, seeing as how I knew exactly where it was and it was within eyesight to mock me.

Having been to the Nobu in Palo Alto and having had an overall positive experience, I wanted to check this Nobu out. Nothing was terrible, but not everything was up to the Nobu standard I expected.

The good: cucumber martini was easily one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Their creative mixing of lychee with cucumber really set this drink apart. Yuzu yellowtail appetizer was also very good and fresh, and their handroll (yellowtail with green onion) and house special cut roll were not only delicious, but reasonably good values for the price. Dessert (fried banana with passion fruit reduction and mango shichimi ice cream) was overpriced but a very creative and delicious dessert.

The bad: lobster with shrimp entree turned out to be stir fried mushrooms with just a tiny bit of actual seafood. That in itself wouldn't have been awful, but the sauce didn't actually even taste great: too tart without much other flavor. Lobster tacos were also a huge miss: the lobster had been fragmented and stir fried with so many other remnants that I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster. It was also ridiculous that I paid $9 for a ""taco,"" which was basically a tiny single bite sized morsel of mystery meat with a wonton skin shell.

I expect and am prepared to hemorrhage money when I go to Nobu, but I also expect a phenomenal dining experience in exchange.

Multicultural waiters barking out orders in Japanese to the swift and focused sushi chefs, ultra trendy and modern decor, gorgeous breezy open space... And creative, masterfully prepared food to boot.

Not quite five stars since Nobu is actually no place for the sushi purist - I've had FAR better sake belly (my all time hands down favorite cut of fish), let alone regular sake, elsewhere - and service certainly could've been more attentive. Also I should state the obvious that you better be prepared to drop serious cash on your meal since dishes aren't served with garnishes or accompaniments (unless you don't mind eating pure protein). That said, my black cod miso was phenomenal and easily one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had (only behind the halibut at 3 Michelin star le Bernadin in NYC). The more-sweet-than-savory miso glaze enveloped the outer flesh of the fish in a perfectly caramelized crust, and yet somehow the meat was barely cooked to achieve an unbelievably juicy tenderness. It was actually so moist that the layers of flaky flesh simply slid off of one another and into puddles of juice upon the gentlest prod of the fork and dissolved onto the tongue.

We came here on a Saturday evening without a reservation but we were able to snag a seat at the bar.

We started off with cocktails, I got the lychee martini and my boyfriend had the cucumber martini.  I think my martini was pretty average but his was delightful.  It had a hint of lychee in it as well and was really refreshing.  

This was our first time here and we were not sure what to order, but our bartender was very helpful.  We started off with his first recommendation which was the Yellowtail with Jalapenos.  I was very hesitant at first because I dont like jalapenos unless they are pickled and on my nachos.  The combination of the yuzu sauce, jalapeno and cilantro on the fish was perfect.  The order came with 6 small pieces and my boyfriend and I were pretty sad that it was all gone.  Next we had the shrimps with spicy garlic.  Absolutely amazing, the shrimps were plump and huge and it came with mixed veggies.  I normally dont eat veggies but we cleaned up this dish.  I kept drowning my veggies in the sauce, it was super good and not too garlicky where our breaths were bad.  After this we got the new style salmon.  This normally comes in a filet but the bartender had it sliced into small pieces for us to share.  Again, very very good.  I even found the recipe online and am going to try to make it at home soon.  Finally, after all of this I was still hungry, so our bartender recommended the black cod miso.  They came out lettuce wrapped style.  Very tasteful and crunchy.

Service here was very good.  Out bartender kept checking up on us, he even gave us complimentary pineapple martinis and training chopsticks for me since he saw I was struggling.  It did get a little weird though, another guy behind the bar asked my boyfriend if he could grab him another drink.  I didnt think it would be a problem until a girl behind the bar gave him a dirty look and started ""telling"" our original bartender.  After the second guy gave us my boyfriends new drink, he started talking to us about craps.  I wish he didnt though because that girl was shooting him dirty looks for about 5 minutes.  Im pretty sure she was talking shit about him to the other guys behind the bar too.  Very weird and unprofessional.  -1 star for that.

I would totally come back here next time I am in town.  This was one expensive meal but totally worth it.  Next time, we wont come in wearing only t shirts and basketball shorts though.",nJUWYMRIGDQ03oI_e2Pb3A,0,0,4,kncIIsNydZOgsgnKsKYs9A

In addition, the atmosphere is warm and romantic. The service was outstanding, with our waiter returning throughout the meal to see whether we enjoyed the previous dish.

My only criticism would be the price - was certainly expensive, ending at $220 per person after tip and wine. That being said, we ate A LOT that night, so we could have cut back a little.

It was so disappointing for all of us. The tuna was passable, but the yellowtail was inedible, and the salmon not so hot either. We were all gagging by the end of the meal. 

This experience makes me question whether there is ANY fine cuisine in Vegas, or is it just a mall where all the culinary brands - banking on the ignorance caused by the beyond terrible general level of food in most of the US -- are making people feel like they are eating fine cuisine in huge portions  by designing the space luxuriously and charging 40 dollars for an entree and selling it in huge volume, while just industrializing the recipes and using low quality ingredients.

We ordered the miso black cod, some sort of shaved artichoke salad, shrimp tempura and California sushi rolls, and shared everything.

After finishing our cod we found a hair on our plate. We informed our waiter who immediately had the manager come over. He offered us a new plate, but since we'd already finished it that didn't make much sense so we declined. Even though that is seriously icky I have to say that cod was life changing. I'm not a huge fish person. It's not that I don't like it, but most of the time when dining out I choose something other than fish. This was amazing. Sort of sweet, not ""fishy"" tasting at all, very moist (almost oily) and flaky. My two friends who both love seafood said it was some of the best fish they've ever had. The salad was also wonderful. All the components were shaved so finely it didn't even feel like a normal salad. Sushi is one of those things I want to like, but most of the time I really don't. I think it's the nori (when I eat seaweed by itself I want to gag. It's like eating ocean water, and not in a good way). The sushi here, though, was perfect. Best sushi I have ever had, hands down. We finished off with a dessert sampler, and I remember enjoying everything, but the only dessert that stands out was a miso cheesecake.

Portions are average to small. We were not very hungry going into this dinner, but if we had come in with empty stomachs we would have left and probably needed a snack. 

Prices are on the high end, not exorbitant, but I'd say the entrees average $40. Because the portions aren't large I could easily see spending $100+ per person, especially with drinks.

Even though finding a hair in our food was gross, I know that can happen, and the manager was really great, and comped the dish, so it really didn't mar our evening. Our waiter, however, was pretty rude following the incident. I couldn't figure out if he thought we'd planted it or he was annoyed we weren't ordering more, but he was warm at the start of the evening, and following that was pretty detached. 

The experience here wasn't perfect, and they really probably deserve a 4, but the food was just so amazing that I'll forgive everything else.",a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g,0,1,5,faWBVr20Vn9hmHR5mypTCQ

We opted to make a dinner reservation and unfortunately the only time was 5pm. We showed up to an empty restaurant but had a nice table for 8 in the middle of the establishment. Here is where our 
experience went to shit... One name, we met Alexandra our server. Alexandra, an overzealous brunette, greeted our table and immediately showed her true agenda, attacking our wallets as quickly as possible. ""I recommend you have one person to order for the table or have one of Chef Nobu's highly trained culinary professionals order for you"". The menu is intentionally vague so you have no choice but to rely on the recommendations of Alexandra, who was highly trained in the art of stealing, I mean selling. Only one Chardonnay choice for by the glass and it was $19.

To summarize, server sucked, my two sushi rolls were average at best and I walked out with a $300 bill for only me and my smoking hot wife. I'm not a peevish person normally but I left annoyed, luckily I immediately left Nobu and saw the Britney show which salvaged the evening. Note: if you go to Nobu, have a good group because I still had a blast because of the fellowship with the group at the table. Alexandra was nice to take a picture of the group on the way out.

Sure, I can get dishes like yellowtail jalapeno, rock shrimp and black cod with miso anywhere now.  But there's a special, fuzzy place in my heart for Nobu...it's where I lost my ""upscale sushi"" virginity all those years ago in Tribeca.  Every meal in any location has always been awesome and never has let me down.  Just like vodka!

This particular location is very pretty and the big cocoon-like booths look really cool.  Why are they still at the Hard Rock?  Does Mr. Hard Rock have nude photos of Mr. Nobu eating at Panda Express or something??   They also have the most expansive menu that I've seen from Matsuhisa-san, so branching out from the oldies but tasties was a must. 

Their version of hamachi kama was (yooda, yooda) the best I've ever had.  Impressive in size, the heavy on the salt based seasoning and brick oven baked flavor was outstanding.  The yellowtail meat was so tender that it had everyone gnawing on the bones with bare hands just to get every bit.  The server almost lost a limb when he prematurely assumed we were done.  

After very little convincing, so minimal in fact that I think I exclaimed ""YES! THAT!"" while pointing at the guy as soon as he said ""chu-toro"", we got the daily special of the medium fatty tuna topped with truffle, crispy garlic and greens.

I came for dinner, and there was a special menu.  It had samples of different types of sushi/sashimi, and even tapas style Japanese cuisine.  The plate, which included a variety of mini desert bites, was about $120, which was money well spent.

5624485,2018-01-17,1,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Don't even think about it, just go. My boyfriend and I finished watching Absinthe on Sunday night and didn't feel like walking too far for dinner so we decided to dine at Nobu. We arrived at 9:30pm with no reservations and they were able to seat us. I would definitely recommend making reservations though.

My first thought when we arrived was how romantic and chill this place is. The ambiance immediately put me a relaxed mood. Now I haven't been to any other Nobu locations so I can't compare, but I really enjoyed our experience here. We started out with an Old Fashioned and Nobu Sidecar. The Old Fashioned was stronggggg. My Nobu Sidecar was deliciously made with Japanese whiskey. Moving on to the foods...

Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeo 5/5 - I'm not even a huge fan of yellowtail but this dish was prepared in a little ponzu sauce topped with jalapenos and cilantro (which I also don't like) which all came together so well. Fish was very fresh.
Monkfish pate with cavier 5/5 - droolsssssssssss as I'm writing about this dish. So so good. Monfish pate just melts in your mouth. Cavier was delish. Sauce was a little on the sweet side but still good nonetheless.
Black cod miso 5/5 - MUST GET! At first we overlooked this until our waiter said this is Nobu's #1 dish. I was definitely glad we got it. Who knew cod can taste so good?! You can definitely taste the miso that is marinated with the fish. We were told it gets marinated for 10 hours.
Salmon belly, sweet shrimp, and sea urchin sashimi 3/5 - Don't get me wrong, everything was extremely fresh and good but after trying the previous 3 dishes the sashimi ended up being pretty mediocre. Bottom line - skip the sashimi and get their specialties.
Flourless chocolate cake with matcha green tea ice cream 4/5 - chocolate cake has hot lava oozing out of it while the cold ice cream cools everything down; a perfect blend.

This is not a place for the cheap, but it is well worth the splurge for a special occasion. For a couple of dishes, 2 drinks, and dessert, our bill ended up being around $300 for 2. Some may argue it's not worth it but go see for yourself. =)",mC-Nq-FfHJb-8OTWOh0pxw,2,2,5,PCXQ2j-OuE72SZ5VO1Hn8Q

5638931,2013-06-21,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"One of the, no joke, top ten meals of my life.  This review is brief because I don't really know all of WHAT I ate, but what I can say is this:

* If you have a group, this is an amazing place to come.  They have large, 10 person, knights of the round-esque tables with rotating bezels for the different plates.  You can spin them around and share everything really easy this way.  Table size is perfect, too, because you can easily talk to every person in your group.

* Sake is a great play; easy to share, lot of unique (I think? what the hell do I know) varieties.

* If you have a group, they'll recommend a sort of ""chef menu"" thing where your server just brings a bunch of plates out in phases that accommodate your budget.  Our group said $100-$150 a dude (without drinks) and we had a perfect meal.  Everyone left full, we tried way more dishes than we would have if we were ordering ad-hoc, and there was no headaches splitting up the bill.

Our group dinner was broken up into a few phases: 1) ceviche plates, 2) hot plates, 3) tacos, 4) sushi, 5) dessert (on the house since they had a little wine snafu).  The favorite thing I ate was probably the different ceviches; the salmon one was particularly good.  Really tasted different than a normal sushi or salmon dish, which I think are generally kind of boring.  The beef taco was also really damn good, but I do agree that -- if I was ordering piecemeal -- it's way on the expensive side.

All in all, Nobu, for me, lived up to all the hype.  Usually these mega-restaurants from top tier chefs are solid but not amazing.  In this case, everything I ate was unique, well executed, and delicious.  Table was perfect. Restaurant was cool.  Service was great.  That's all you can really ask for when you are paying for a premium meal.",58my341k37MjsbG_A5WMZQ,1,0,5,1MmMpcQHZOERj0pLI_rlfg

         ""The ideal destination to be seen and socialize!"" So that's what they say on their website. I love every Nobu resto, especially I got to meet the chef himself. This was the first-ever Nobu hotel, restaurant and lounge will offer a stylish new experience of luxury and hospitality, appealing to returning Caesars Palace guests and the alike. 

         This gigantic space of  11,200 square foot Nobu restaurant and lounge, located in the heart of the Nobu Hotel,  offer several teppanyaki tables, sushi bar and private dining area along with a large lounge and bar boasting over 300 seats. This is massively big for my taste and probably the biggest Nobu resto ever!

         Modern, chic, but too big to be cozy and attentive service. They put us away as most of my RSVP would have the word LOUD next to my name :-) So that my friends and loved ones can be loud with laughter and joy when we dine out.

       The food wasn't all up to the bar. Sadly to say that Blue Ribbon offers better for the same price point. Although I think I still get more bang for my buck at other sushi places in Vegas. Even if you go to Noby at the Hard Rock Hotel, same food for 30% less in price point. 
 
FOOD:

- Spicy Seafood Soup $18 

- Shishito pepers

- Hamachi Sashimi with Jalapeno $28 - Nobu signature dish. 

- Ankimo Monkfish Pate with Caviar $30 - ouch, it was 3 pieces, nothing more special but good.

- Miso glazed black cod $34 - ouch, was 1 of Nobu's signature dish, consistent!

- Lobster ceviche $34 - 4 lettuce cup ceviche, refreshing. 

- Shrimp and Maine Lobster with Spicy Lemon $38

SUSHI and SASHIMI single piece:

- Abalone $10 
- Hottategai $ 6
- Aji $6 
- Uni $10
- Shima Aji $ 7
- Tai $9 
- Kampachi $8
- Otoro $20

- Wagyu sashimi - delicious, 1 of my FAV dishes of the night! 

- Hirame sashime - delicious.

         Instead of sake, we opted for a few bottles of Champagne, reasonable mark up, just about 350% which is nothing compare for Vegas standard - Nicolas Feuillatte Brut Réserve Champagne, Louis Roederer ""Brut Premier"" Champagne.

       We left uncertainty how we felt about ths new sushi spot. It was just an OK overall for us. Do I go out of my way to come back here again, not really, but it's still a good spot to check it out.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,6,5,4,9xzh6nSTt9rHIEMV-V1uMg

So I jumped on it! The food was so good that the chef prepared it to where you don't have to dip it in any additional sauces. You clean your palette with the giant pickled ginger sticks! I'm used to the thinly slices slivers, but these chunks are my new favorite.

I was truly impressed with the servers who were able to explain each dish they served without stuttering or adding ""uhm."" They were very confident and knowledgeable of the dish served! The chef carefully placed each ingredient on the plate making it look like art! 

So you may ask ""why 4 stars?""  For a high end restaurant with 4 dollar signs, I didn't expect my chopsticks to be the wood ones where you have to manually break off yourself and hope it actually splits in half. I would suggest keeping the disposable chopsticks, but ones that are already separated. Also, the food was a bit salty. I went through several glasses of water and that could just be that I'm dehydrated from the Vegas heat. Who knows. I would recommend anyone coming here for their first time to try to sampler! 

Unfortunately I don't remember all the cool names and all the fish that I ate but I'll try my best to describe them in my photos attached!",KDuWv96lLrfkKQ-4KtaU8w,9,5,4,N3Vs6SZ0mZslz-t1UIlmTA

As a vegan, I was thoroughly impressed when the server was completely understanding and helpful in picking out many choices. In addition to having Tofu Toban-Yaki, he explicitly stated that the chef could prepare a multitude of dishes with vegetable/protein substitute!

I ordered the Omakase: Nobu Signature Menu Tasting option (Normally costing $125, while the vegetarian option cost $100). It came with 8 courses (desert included). Their skill showed, as they essentially gave me the same experience a regular customer would receive with that meal option. The vegan desert was also to die for.

The only downside is that most dishes are small portioned and high prices, save some $10-15 dishes.

Either way, excellent food and experience.",u64EFxe5d3ix5V3td8rOJQ,0,0,5,x7e4I-SvJxjKExrNhYR4wg

Literally wanted Japanese food with my co-workers and stumbled here. This place is totally packed and you have to expect a wait. If I had been prepared for this place, I would've totally knew what to order but I was literally just stuck. Ordered the salmon roll, hamachi roll and toro hand roll. 

I have to say, this changed my perspective about eating sushi..it was so simple and clean (what i mean is no extra sauces, nothing fried, no extra veggies). It made me appreciate every bite of the fish. I loved all the fish I ordered..the hamachi was nice because of the jalapeño added to it and I just love toro..so mouth drooling! And the sauce was to die for!! I won't forget the taste of it and I wish I could describe it, but I would totally fail. 

To be honest, this type of restaurant is not really my style. I'm giving this four stars because the service was good and it changed the way I like to eat my sushi now (as weird as it sounds). I used to get rolls that had sooo much stuff on it, but now, I love getting more simplistic rolls. Would I come back here again?

Everything started out as expected, our servers were pleasant, cocktails were tasty and we were ready to throw down on some amazing eats. I'll add a few notes about what worked well first. The tuna appetizer was probably my fave over the yellowtail w/ jalapeño appetizer. The king crab kohlrabi salad was soooo good, we ordered it again. The black cod miso, which they're known for, didn't disappoint. It was so tasty with the glaze. We tried both of the Chilean sea bass entrees and the one with the black bean sauce was the winner. Having dined out with this group on several occasions, we always get an oyster or uni shooter. It's actually one thing I look forward to. We opted for a round of uni shooters. Whoah. It was like taking a shot of straight soy sauce, no uni taste whatsoever. And, it wasn't one person in our group, everybody had the same reaction. We brought it to our server's attention. The staff could have handled this better. It went from, the shooter is supposed to taste that way, to we will comp you the birthday dessert, to we can take 1/2 of the shooters off your bill to finally taking all of the shooters off our bill.

So, I've easily eaten at 50 different restaurants over the years. And probably closer to 100. Almost every single one of them is gone, even the last one I dined at: the Grand Wok at MGM Grand just four months ago!!

Nobu is an incredible experience for a bon vivant of Japanese cuisine. This is not an AYCE buffet restaurant; don't expect to stuff yourself like a pig at a trough. You'll broach into the world of fine dining here, which is why there's 27 different forks at each place setting. Um, chopsticks, in this case. Understand this, you'll be paying a lot of money, for tiny portions. This is about epicurean presentation and culinary aesthetics, not about seeing how many sashimi slices you can fit in your maw. The delicacies you shall consume were designed and created by a master chef who sat meditating on a mountaintop until a culinary epiphany hit him like a bolt of lightning. Luckily, he survived and came down the mountainside to bring his dream unto the world. 

I loved my dining experience here. It was during a solo trip I made to Vegas. Don't think I'd want to bring my young daughter here. She can be a handful at times, and it was nice to be able to just relax, and enjoy myself. And have some great food. I can't wait to come back here. Maybe after I win the lottery!

Sat at the bar and wanted omakase.  It was my first time here and I didn't feel like filtering through the menu, nor did I know what was worth trying.  Server shot us down and said it was too late- fair enough, but not really cause they sat a couple RIGHT NEXT to us  ten minutes after we were sat who clearly had omakase.

That was rather painful to watch cause they kept getting dishes I was interested in trying.

Both the server and sushi chef were useless in offering up some suggestions, so I just picked a bunch of stuff from the menu ($400 worth of shit).  Nothing stood out. Fish was ok, not any different from what I could get at kabuto or something.  Kept asking sushi chef to make something worth my while, but maybe I had higher expectations than he, cause he did not deliver.

The service is fantastic- helpful staff all around. Polite and warm, they help make the experience better.

Luckily, I have been in Vegas for work, so have had the opportunity to try some great restaurants.  So far, Nobu may have been the most expensive, but also the most delicious!

We opted to let the server make the menu for us and gave him a price point.  We went with about $100 - $125 per person, and we were all blown away.  I don't know what most of the dishes were called because we let the waiter pick.  However, I will describe the hightlights.

1) Favorite dish was the Miso Cod.  I'm not sure what Chef Nobu does to make it better than all of the other Cod dished I have had, but it was amazing.  This dish just melted on my mouth.

2) There was a raw whitefish with some chili powder flavor on it.  It was what we started with and was delicious

3) Seared Salmon Belly was also awesome.  It was tender and the sauce it was paired with was great

4) Dessert was a shave ice bowl with green beens, mochi, and other flavors.  It was a bit sweet, but also really good.

The only thing that I was not crazy about was the sushi selection.  There were 2 rolls that came, that I did not particularly enjoy.  The lobster roll was nothing fancy, and the nobu roll was a bit too ""fishy' of a taste.  The Tuna sushi was really good, as was the seared salmon sushi.  

Overall, a great meal with great service.  The price was a little much, and for me I felt it was a little excessive.  Definitely a 5 star evening.",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,1,1,5,Fc-5ND2IUmMFWTkWIoIfeg

All the other sushi dishes are delicious. For the hot dishes, I wasn't impressed at all with their black cod or the meat dish. It was just too sweet and tasted caramelized. I kind of wished that they just served sushi for the rest of the dishes.   

For what we ate, I think it was over-priced. I've had much better omakase at a better price. If you want to impress a date, take them here. If you want the same tasting sushi at a lower price, go somewhere else. Not sure why they have such high reviews.

I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeño Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be.

5 Star Plus!!

Chef Nobu has merged Japanese cuisine with Peruvian (and some Argentinian) styles of both preparing and cooking.  

My husband and I love Peruvian and Japanese - so together this place is a dream.  

The service was impeccable, prompt and delightful.  

Some things off the menu were very good and some were very bad. 

The good: the mixed seafood.  Similar to Peruvian Ceviche.  Plentiful, too.  The Spicy seafood soup.  Nice and hot and full of forever garlic.  Perfect for a cold night.  

The bad: We let our server convince us to try the Cod.  We should have known better.  It was not good.  

We were in a hurry to catch Absinthe and I was not finished with my wine.  Our server gave me my wine in a Casino glass and we were on our way.

As two twenty two year olds (yes we're young but we're second generation fine dining foodies), my best friend and I were craving the best sashimi Sin City had to offer and after a Nobu siting we had decided there was no where else to go but here. 

Each staff member we had been in contact in were of the upmost respectful and delightful waitstaff in town. Offering personal recommendations tailored to our tastes and the extra insights from the GM Bryan himself truly made our experience. By taking the time to understand our taste and cravings they were able to custom make the ideal menu for us. 

Must try all of their sashimi, seriously, do it! And don't forget my new favorite: the black cod lettuce wraps, an off the menu item specifically recommended to us by Bryan. The perfect way to end a delightful dinner.

Jonathan was our waiter for the night and he took care of our group in every way possible. We were here for a work conference and we had a moderate budget to work with. He was more than understanding and made sure that having a budget would not take away from our experience at the restaurant. He was right!!

Dishes at Nobu are served family style. Jonathan constructed an 8 course menu for us and every dish he brought out provided an unparalleled experience to our taste buds! My favorite dish of the night must have been either the Black Cod in Miso (his most famous dish) or the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu sauce. 

The kicker was that Chef Nobu was at the restaurant! In my brief moment of meeting him, I would describe him as humble, down-to-earth and genuine. I know I don't know him at all beyond that point but first impressions can be very telling.

We ordered another roll that was off menu and really enjoyed it. We finished with two desserts and we're definitely stuffed. 

Nobu dining is always an experience and we were very pleased with our meal. Service was on point and the environment was very hip. Nobu is never disappointing so we will be back.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,1,4,VS_3aQ0Sz3p1NFEhVEu_ig

The new style sashimi and Wagyu gyoza are amazing and definitely worth a try. The presentation and delivery add to the unique experience of this restaurant. 

The service was good however it was a bit slow, so be prepared to come with some time to spare if you are planning to grab some food here.",12-5RdgXp8hQF7--P8fGUg,1,1,4,qW1yFEwfUp4bCWi88hjoEQ

Every restaurant these days has a variation of Nobu's menu items. Everyone now has rock shrimp, the jalapeño yellowtail, lychee martinis.....but nobody can compare! 

If it's your first time at Nobu try the Miso cod. It's phenomenal!! The Rock shrimp (spicy) is a classic fried shrimp in a spicy mayo sauce (can't go wrong) and not really so ""spicy"".  I love that they use real lychee juice in their martinis rather than lychee puree or liquor. 

No dinner is ever complete without dessert! We always get the chocolate bento box but this time they had BUBBLE GUM Ice cream! Very subtle flavor and anyone that knows me knows I'm a sucker for anything bubble gum or cotton candy flavored! 

If you are debating on going! Go! You won't be disappointed!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,0,1,5,6bFZMsmBU-CefgapPZxWLg
5978522,2015-01-27,0,pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"Went last night for 9p dinner. We were a group of four. We were given a no e table and our server was Troy. Two of us ordered cosmopolitan Martinis and they tasted off. They swore they were tequila. The manager came back and explained they were made Nobu style and not with contreau so that was most likely the issue. They did remake them. The service was very good. Issues were with the food. The server advised of three specials but never gave prices. We ordered a tuna sashimi appetizer with truffle and watercress. It was six SMALL pieces. The cost was a crazy
$80. Shame on us for not asking but shame on them for not explaining. CRAZY OVERPRICED. When we ordered the Wagyu beef tacos at $13 each Troy explained they were each one bite literally. They were. Rey good though. 
We purchased the following
Tiradito white fish $28 small but nice. Seriously very little fish
Edamame nice size and fresh. Heck it was the only filling thing $7
A spicy tuna roll $12 a shrimp tempura roll $14
Two grey goose and sodas $12 each
Four grey goose cosmopolitans at $16 each
Ice tea $2
Three wagyu beef tacos $13 each
One black bean cod which was a hot entree. 
With a 20 percent tip our total was $408. YES FOLKS $408 and we were hungry. We ended up going back to Mandalay bay and having turkey club sandwiches at 1AM. We were lliterallyy all hungry. NEVER AGAIN! Iwill pay for quality but felt as though we were robbed without a gun. Just wrong. Remember any specials ask the price first. Sticker shock isn't the word.",D224RQ9WRnWmndZJiQ-kAA,1,0,2,3nmXbQxJYpq6ZsLD0RfCjg
