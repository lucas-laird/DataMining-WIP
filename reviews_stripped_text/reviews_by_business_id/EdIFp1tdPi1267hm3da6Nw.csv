If you love ribs, and don't mind getting your fingers a bit messy, this is an excellent place to eat for a very reasonable price.  You'll be tempted to go to the main dining room, and there's nothing wrong with that place, but you'll certainly want to give the rib-joint consideration.  Splurge and go for the full-rack.  The half-rack is fine for a limited appetite, but if you're hungry just go for the full-rack.

The ribs are loaded with sauce, and the meat just falls off of the bone with little effort, which is exactly what you're looking for in a good rack of ribs.  You'll get a small (very, very small) portion of baked beans and creamy coleslaw, along with two pieces of bread, but your attention will be on the ribs, so that's not too much of a problem.

I see a review to the right as I'm typing, and another user complained about some tranny prostitutes, but I didn't see any the few times I've been to this location.  As to the restaurant being ""kid friendly"", I'm not sure what that means, but Las Vegas is for adults, and there are clearly designated areas where children aren't allowed, i.e., the casino portion of the establishment.  There are plenty of places for the kids to sit in the restaurant portions of the establishment, but you shouldn't expect a Circus Circus experience here.",wM826KHTxfMC4paZ13rwxg,1,0,4,RiGX2VIOIq2i4OaV9aLqaw

It used to be in the front of the casino by the brewery but now it has its own restaurant. The restaurant opens daily at 4pm, YES 4 in the afternoon ! and closes at 10 (Sun - Thurs) and 11pm (Fri - Sat). Very limited parking in front but they have a garage in the back. 

NOTE: you HAVE to be 21 and over to dine at this restaurant. IDs are required if they are suspicious of age. had one case where some friends had to return home 20 minutes away to grab IDs and come back. 

FYI - DISCOUNT FOR PLAYERS CLUB CARD. FREE TO OBTAIN. WORTH THE $2 DIFF PER ITEM ! ACQUITE COUPON FROM PLAYERS CLUB KIOSK - APPLICABLE FOR ENTIRE TABLE ! Also, during your wait, you can attempt your luck at the nearest machine. For new applicants, you have a chance of free play $5 - $500 after you put in $5 of your own money. 

Something new as of this recent visit. You are able to go on waitlist by yelp app and you have a tracking of waitlist position by NoWait app. Didn't know about the waitlist by yelp app but we were told our wait was 45-60 minutes being in 13th place. We were sat down in maybe less than 30 minutes. We've always had a wait every time I had came here, just depends if its a short or longer wait. The turnover rate is fairly quick so the waits usually not too bad. 

Decently sized restaurant with a lot of tables. Give or take 3-4 servers attending to the entire restaurant. 

The menu is VERY simple of only 4 items.

Full Rack Baby Back Ribs $16.99 ($14.99 with players club card)
Half Rack & Half BBQ Chicken $14.99 ($12.99 with players club card)
Half Rack Baby Back Ribs $12.99 ($10.99 with players club card)
Half BBQ Chicken $11.99 ($9.99 with players club card)

All entrees come with their own root beer barbeque baked beans, corn on the cob, cole slaw, and garlic bread

SIDE NOTE - $5 SPLIT PLATE charge and NO SPLIT CHECKS (well this recent visit, they allowed 2 credit cards. YMMV?)

We decided to ask about the beers as they are locally brewed in house. $2.50 for 20oz ! HOLY CRAP ! CHEAP ! LOL 

I had ordered a full rack of ribs, one friend (whos never came here before) got half rack and half chicken, and another friend who I almost always come with, had gotten only a half rack of ribs. Took maybe 5-10 minutes for the waiter to tend to our table but things went decently after that. Beers and waters came like 10 minutes later. Food came shortly after too. 

Lots of food for the money. For my order, 11 rib rack with 2 pieces of corn, a cup of cole slaw, a cup of baked beans, and 2 ""sticks"" of garlic bread. For the most part, it is the same as its always been except the garlic bread went from something maybe cut from a loaf of bread to actual bread sticks. 

Ribs are always so good. Fall off the bone, super tender. Love their barbeque sauce. I had been craving this for at least 1.5 years (since my trip to Orlando in Nov 2015) where I had ribs. Baked beans are cooked with root beer apparently and with bacon. Never been a fan of cole slaw but it had some bell peppers in it which made it a little weird normal than normal. 

I never had problems in the past finishing a full rack of ribs and everything but this time, I was only able to eat half of the rack. Worst of all, we got a HUGE food coma afterwards and knocked out early. 

Great deal overall for good ribs. Can't beat it anywhere in town. If only it was more convenient to get to but maybe that would be a bad thing, if you know what I mean... XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,4,X9H2PnsIR4k64zH37gq5xw
1402728,2016-12-01,0,EdIFp1tdPi1267hm3da6Nw,"I go to LV twice a year for business and we stay pretty close to EI.  It is one block off the strip just down from Ballys and Flamingos so a pretty good location.  We stay at the Tuscany (check it out) and it is one block from EL and two blocks from Ballys.  EL is a casino with restaurants and a hotel right next door (Days Inn I think).   It is also walking distance from EI to the High Roller (check it out) and a relatively new shopping and restaurant area next to the High Roller and when there, you don't even know you are in LV.... No slot machines LOL. 

EI is truly a local favorite and our business group always make it a point to spend time there.  I always go one night and have the steak dinner which I think is $8.99.  That comes with a nice thick steak (Tip: don't get it medium well unless you really want it well done).  It comes with soup or salad, veggies and potatoes so is a pretty good deal.  This time I ordered the BBQ and it was pretty good, juicy and flavorful.  It is not as good as Chattanooga BBQ but not bad.  They do give you so much that you can hardly finish it. 

Now the good part.  They are also a microbrewery and make their own beer (I guess that is why it is called a microbrewery).  Beer is $2.25 a pint and when a game is on, beers are only a DOLLAR (+++!).  I always get the Amber which is very good.  They also have karaoke in the bar area (I think every night) and it is fun but if you want to participate, you sometimes have to wait and hour to show off.

Ambiance is dimmed lighting and there is a glass on one wall where you can see the screens of the bar on other side and watch the games, fights etc. Double score!

First off, its cheap. Steak dinner for less than $10, half-rack of ribs for $12. You can't hardly get a hot dog for $10 on the strip. 

Second, and most importantly, it is fantastic food. Their root beer BBQ is like liquid crack and the ribs were falling off the bone tender. I can't recall ever having more tender or better tasting ribs. The sides were good (Baked beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob and garlic bread), but the ribs stole the show.

My wife got the half chicken and she said it was cooked perfectly.

Our server was Ricardo, and he did a fantastic job of being scarce when we didn't need him but appearing within seconds if we needed something. He did a great job of making sure we wanted for nothing.

The room décor is simple, minimal   and very cozy. Hours are 4pm - 10pm and this place is always busy but the flow of clients in and out is fast.   But if  you do end up waiting you can't blame them  the BBQ is delicious and know that you wont be disappointed.  The menu is simple BBQ chicken or pork ribs and sides are Cole slaw, root beer beans, corn on the cob  and bread with butter. The meat pulls right off the bone on the ribs and meat is not dry and the BBQ sauce is really good.  The chicken although I did not eat it this time it is really good as well. This casino has its own brewery and beers are  $2, back in the day they were just a $1 definitely a steal then and now and the perfect drink to compliment  your BBQ.  The food portions are huge for the money and if you get the players club card there is an extra savings on your meal so do not pass that up.

Point one: you have to walk thru the Ellis Island casino lobby to get to the BBQ. The cigarette smoke was immediate and terrible. It, literally, stinks. It's unbearable. 

Point two: the restaurant is in the stinky casino lobby. This is important. 

Point three: the patrons are (nearly) all morbidly obese Caucasians. 

Point four: there's no bar.

Point five: nothing on the (limited) menu costs more than $15.

Had the rack of ribs, came with their version of garlic bread, cole slaw(which i don't eat), and baked beans and corn on the cob. Needless to say, i'm used to a slab because i like the cartilage bones and twice as much. All that ended up was a empty plate, so it must not have been good!!!
The ribs were fall off the bone soft, not overly seasoned or too much sauce but very good smoked flavour.
Another great find was, they brew their own root beer, since I don't really like that yellow swill everyone drinks, I opted for the root beer, not too sweet and not overly carbonated but a big ""go to"" if you are not a beer fanatic.
The empty plate shows what I think about the food.",yolcmtGJMByxHonzKXDnyw,1,2,4,JvLH-C4av4zj581WLujdZA

Here is my full review of Ellis Island and their fabulous everything. I grew up in Las Vegas, so I like old-fashioned Vegas casinos with old-fashioned service. I'm not one for the big Glitz and glamour of the strip, I like something small, a little bit more intimate. My friend told me about the root beer here and how it's the best in the world. When it comes to root beer, I will be the judge of that. She told me they brew their own root beer here and I absolutely had to try it along with their rack of ribs.

Upon entering, I felt as if I was taken back into the early nineties of Las Vegas, karaoke was going and there was a DJ back in the back right in front of the barbecue house. 

I went in to order my food which was the rack of ribs and the root beer. I was absolutely surprised at the reasonable cost of my meal considering how much food I was going to get. While waiting, I decided to head outside and listen to music. The DJ didn't mind my impromptu belly dancing, neither did any of the patrons because that's the type of place this is. You can be real, you could be yourself, you could be fun and you don't have to worry about security wondering if you're on drugs. I'm not on drugs, I'm high on life and about ready to sit down to a darn good plate of food. Who wouldn't be excited and want to dance over that? A boring person that's who!

I came back to a large plate of ribs which pretty much fell off the bone. I don't like it when their Saucy and the meat has no flavor, this was the exact opposite of that!

However, my review is not on the food - it's on the root beer. My friend was right, slap my face... she was right!

It was the best darn root beer I had ever had.
I brew my own root beer, so that's saying a lot. It took a little while for our food to come out, but I didn't mind I had some dancing to do. Even if the arrival of my food took longer, I would have gone into the karaoke bar and entertained myself. 

If I had a problem with the wait, I should not have gone on Friday night when it was busy. However, I'm not one of those picky people that complain about waiting too long, I'm one of those fun people who will go find something to do to keep myself occupied. All in all, I absolutely love this little gem of a casino as it reminds me of the old days in Vegas. Not a lot of people remember old Vegas, Ellis Island is a tribute to that.

REASONS TO VISIT ELLIS ISLAND CASINO BBQ:
1. Old Vegas feeling
2. Intimate Environment
3. Not over crowed
4. Live DJ on Fridays
5. Karaoke while you're waiting for your ribs
6. Great rack of ribs!!!!
7. Amazing prices

This place is about half a mile away from the Linx, just a short walk or Uber ride. The location itself is nothing to write home about and the hotel itself appears pretty plain and simple. The casino is on the smaller size but has all your typical Las Vegas gambling entertainment needs. They advertised $2 off for becoming a member and gambling $5 so I did. Also won $35 on one the machines while waiting about 20mins to be seated. The place was tinny and a little dark but the smell was amazing. The menu was surprisingly small. Either a full rack of babyback ribs, half a rack and half a chicken or just a half rack and all plates came with house made coleslaw, root beer BBQ sauce beans, two long bread roll things, and two small corns. Incredibly filling and delicious and best of all, CHEAP!  Alcoholic drinks were $2.50. They have a decent selection of wines and their beers are house made in their brewery and pretty tasty.

Like every other time, my family and I came into the BBQ today and ordered four racks of ribs. The first thing that stood up was the below-average service that our server gave us. He overlooked the drinks and proceeded to asking for our orders. As we finished ordering, in a rude and irritated manner, asked for the drinks. It was a busy day so I was able to comprehend his attitude but when I saw that he treated another customer behind us with much more diligence, I knew it was personal. When the food came, all of our four coleslaws were slimy. When we told the server, he didn't apologize and simply brought four fresh coleslaws.

The main draw used to be the prime rib dinner which they sold for $14.00. The dinner included a twenty ounce beer or root beer. That was a good deal, and me and many friends used to dine there very often. . 

Recently their management no longer provides the free beer or root bear [$2.50) that used to be comped with the meal. and they raised the price of the rib dinner to $17.00.  

It is not worth to me or my friends to drive downtown for a $20.00 meal when I could have the same fare close to home at some of the other casinos for quite a bit less.

We had heard the BBQ here was pretty good. So my husband and I, along with several of our friends thought we would come check out the place. OMG, what a huge mistake we made choosing to have dinner at Ellis Island BBQ! The food here could only be discribed as mediocre at best. Sadly, the food was about as good as it got at this BBQ joint. Almost immediately after our party was  seated, we came to realize that Ellis Island BBQ was staffed by what can only be discribed as absolutely the worst, most pathetic group of individuals hired to run a restaurant in the city of Las Vegas. Our dining experience started with us being waited on by a waiter in a crappy mood & apparently having a really bad day. He was accompanied by a manager who looked absolutely miserable, and could have cared less about the issues we were having with his employee and the food we were served. His actions and body language spoke volumes... I don't know about anyone else, but when the so called manager rolls his eyes, crosses his arms, is steadily tapping his foot and then lets out a big old sigh after we finish speaking with him, I get the feeling that myself and the group I  was with were not valued as customers. Hopefully, someone, anyone who has any REAL authority over the employees of Ellis Island BBQ will see this review. I would suggest that they send in undercover or mystery diners so they can get an idea of what is going on in this restaurant. Personally, I would let the entire crew go, starting with the manager.  Then get a fresh, new staff with a fresh new attitude in there to treat your clientele as they expect and deserve to be treated.",lTQF59hgYMnbKdnpT5bnbA,0,0,1,m90aDAfNwN3RdVFf_LyDcw

I will say that the price is right so you do get what you pay for.  The ribs were just OK.  Hubby's chicken was nearly black on the outside, which I don't mind but he didn't like.   Service was not great.  Would we go back?  Nope!",9UTJNIyd-W9u6X_XzY_EnQ,2,0,2,E__I_Cw49F9ssz2kywmAVw

The place itself looks a bit seedy, so you know it's good! There are no reservations, so you might have to wait to get in but have a beer at the seedy karaoke bar and relax until your turn.

Prices are good too, full slab of ribs about $11. What a win win.

I'll definitely go back",3x1sSKVaNr6wQdvCjiee0w,1,1,4,ZLz7gujcYLu3S9cUjEONPg

5306765,2017-05-13,0,EdIFp1tdPi1267hm3da6Nw,"It's a combined 5 stars between value and quality. We were told about this place by a local and he did us right. His tip was to get a free players club card that gives you discounts on the BBQ dinner. All you have to do is play at least $5 worth with the card. With the discounts our dinners came out to $14. 

Now about the food and service. The service could definitely be better. When we checked in, the hostess acted like she was doing us a favor by putting us on the wait list with an attitude to boot. 

It's not a very big restaurant so it doesn't hold a lot of people, yet the wait help wasn't very good. I feel that a waiter / waitress should check up on their tables every once in a while. That's not asking too much. 

The food is where it's at. Well mainly the bbq that is. The corn is the frozen kind, I've had better beans from a can, the cole slaw had too much onion, the bread was, well bread. Nothing special about their side dishes. 

The ribs and chicken, which is all they have on the menu, is very good. Not having eaten at a lot of bbq restaurants, it's the best restaurant ribs I've had. The chicken is good but not as good as the ribs. Overall it's a killer deal in an expensive town. You get a lot of food. More than the average person can eat in a single sitting.

Now the food was good it came with corn, coleslaw, baked beans and garlic bread. I ordered the full rack of ribs. It came sauced and pretty tender. There was sauce on the table but it tasted like bulls eye. The service was ok, it was very busy so that didn't help. Overall the value is good but have to deal with noisy atmosphere, and all the smoking since it's a small casino with low ceiling. The clientele isn't all that great either. Definitely a grub place not a date place. Wouldn't take kids here that's for sure. 

Now you have to get a players card and a coupon from a kiosk that will get you like $3 off the regular price. A full rack of baby backs with coupon is $14.99 without $17.99

They also have half rack of baby backs  or half chicken or half and half.

P.S. get a glass of root beer thats house made not too sweet and too carbonated, Ellis island is also one of the best micro brewery in las vegas so if your a beer drinker might want to try their different beers.

For instance, I always order the half chicken and half ribs and I've gotten plates where the chicken was incredibly moist and perfect while the ribs were dry...and also vice versa. But for the most party, the food here is BOMB!!!! I'm not a huge beans person, but man oh man, do I love their baked beans. The cole slaw isn't anything to rave about, but it does provide a nice little refresher to get all the bbq coating out of your mouth. I really wished the had mac n cheese or mashed potatoes...I never touch the corn and normally only take a bite out of the bread they give you. I think I'll ask them to omit the corn and bread next time because I feel bad for wasting it. The service is fairly good, though there is one host that can be a little rude (not sure if it's just a language barrier that makes her seem rude)...on 2 different nights, before we could even say anything, when we walked up, she immediately barked ""ID?!"" My husband and I were both stunned, and thought...'that's a first...never thought I'd be ID'd trying to eat ribs' and after we asked for a table for just the two of us, she grabbed menus and started to walk to a booth. We started to follow her and she turns around and, again, barks at us to ""wait there! i have to prepare the table first"" and lastly, on one of the nights, we were already ready to order (having eaten there 2 nights in a row) and let her know that we were ready to order if she could get our server and she says ""i'm not your server"" and walks away.

I hadn't been to Ellis Island BBQ in years and when we came, they had completely remodeled the area. The old BBQ restaurant sat to the side of the pizza kiosk and booths were all out in the open, close to foot traffic, those staring at you longingly to hurry the fuck up so they could eat (those were true expressions on their faces), and those who were playing machines, not even 3 feet from your table, if you happen to get a booth on the outside of the aisle. You also had the option of eating outside, but you were at the mercy of the elements...sometimes it would be cold as hell out there, but you'd take the first available table, anyway because of the long wait. It was also really cool to eat outside, because you got to walk through the brewery to the outside patio. Ellis Island makes their own beer and rootbeer, so it's even more special to go there and be able to try their many selections.

Anyway, the new BBQ restaurant is really nice. You're able to sit away from all the noise and smoke and it seems to run more efficiently. The restaurant is in one of the corners of the casino and there are many more booths and tables. There's a hostess who will greet you and either seat you right away or let you know how long the wait is. Sometimes those waits can be epic, so try to get there as soon as they open...even more so because if they run out of food, they close. It doesn't take long to order because their menu is very simple. They have 3 plates to choose from: A full rack, a half rack, and a half rack and half chicken. All come with beans, coleslaw, garlic bread, and corn on the cob. Plates generally come out within 5 minutes of ordering and that helps with the flow of things. 

Once voted the best BBQ in Vegas several years in a row, I see why. The flavor is so rich and you can taste the smokey tones in the meat. That sauce...oh man, that sauce! Nice, thick, and hearty! They leave a nice big  squeeze bottle of it on your table in case you want extra. It's definitely worth a trip when you come to Vegas.",nOv0AvP4doCU6Kg9ge-xFg,23,19,5,y-ok51J1jxyvV1ZQM6sYNg

TL;DR - I'm not going to bother searching for another BBQ joint in Vegas because I have no doubt this place has the best BBQ ribs I've ever tasted (trust me, I'm half-Texan)

21 and older only. They will text you when your table is ready. Get yourself a play card while waiting for minor savings.

The place was dimmed and cozy. There was no cigarette smell, and the waiter was attentive and friendly enough...kind of.

The menu was short and simple. Both chicken and ribs were tender and the sauce was out of this world. Normally I'd opt for a spicy version, but their sweet BBQ sauce almost converted me. All the sides were good and the portion was enormous and worth every penny.

I finished everyone else's leftover 3 days later in a hotel room back in LA, and they were still delicious (This was after sitting in the fridge for over 2 days, thawed in the trunk of our car for 4 hours driving back to LA, then back into the fridge again for a couple hours before I nuked it in the microwave in hotel lobby for 3 minutes and ate with some cold parts still).

Lucky for us, they had 2 racks of ribs left - so we ordered that!! Hands - down the best BBQ. Absolutely ah-mazing and an excellent price!!
