I walked in the restaurant and sat on one end of the sushi bar as I came there on my own. It took a little while before I was approached but I knew they were quite busy, especially since they had one server taking care of everyone. She was very kind and friendly. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the lunch combination and found that it was more than enough food for one. But it satisfied my hunger, for sure.

One thing that went wrong was that I had to ask about my miso soup after my plate was served. But I guess it turned out alright since that became my desert.

Overall, I'd recommend coming in and checking it out. Its a very laid back and friendly environment and the lunch prices are a real deal.",XyDLSwfbkySPxLFoszyvpA,5,2,4,7WnJEMUS7MW1R11XILPlhg

I first went to this place because it's right by the English school I attend. So I yelped for a Sushi restaurant nearby that I could go for my 30min lunch! Unfortunately, it took a little longer than my 30min lunch. However, it was exactly what I expect sushi to be. Very fresh fish, large pieces of fish and not a lot of rice. Plus, the rice is not sticky like in some other places. I always order salmon avocado with green onions (that Ken does especially for me, he is ok with doing rolls the way you like) and the albacore nigiri (that tastes so good you don't even have to dip in soy sauce).

The menu is also small but the fish is fresh, the chef is friendly, and the service is slightly on the slow side but they're not too busy to get you in and out if you need to: they're just used to folks hanging around chatting after they're done dining. Essentially, it's a neighborhood sushi dive bar.

BLACK FIRE ROLL has eel and a not-overwhelming amount of cream cheese (among other fish) topped with eel sauce and sesame seeds, while the ALASKAN ROLL is pretty standard. Before tip, my total was about $18.

PS: the whiteboard menu has a few silly jokes on it too (goldfish, bad jokes, and good jokes), and if you look around the kitschy d√©cor you'll notice cans of Spotted Dick and Fish Asshole... and a bottle of moonshine sake with a snake in the bottom.

2621930,2010-08-25,0,NkuLKJJE_KxcxKs8Kj8thQ,"Sushi Yamaguchi used to be a regular hangout for me when I worked at the Charleston campus of CSN.  This is a small, traditional Japanese sushi restaurant, with an awesome staff.  I've read somewhere that the owner started the sushi craze here in Las Vegas.  His son, Ken, is the main sushi chef now.  He's a great guy, and I always enjoy a conversation with Ken while I also enjoy some sushi.  By the way, Ken and his father are actually Japanese, which apparently is rather rare in Las Vega for sushi restaurants.

Now, I am not a super sushi expert or anything, but I have had sushi at a few places in my time.  Yamaguchi has always had a sense of quality that other places just don't seem to have.  The rice is nicely prepared, the fish is wonderful, and the craftsmanship is perfect.  Yamaguchi has your traditional sushi and sashimi, but it also has seasonal, experimental rolls.  I love the homemade sauces that they use.  You can just taste the quality ingredients, as opposed to the cheap, over sugared sauces of some other places. 

The two downsides are that it is a small place, so you don't want to go with a huge crowd.  Also, it takes a while to get your food.  Trust me though, it is worth the wait.  if you are a sushi fan, I think you need to try Sushi Yamaguchi.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,0,4,fa5FrEdJnPeThuMEUZKfjg

Even better than the food, if that's possible, was the service.  The owner, Ken, has a great personality.  He talks with his patrons and makes them feel at home.  He also has a great sense of humor.

My husband tried the snake sake, per another reviewers tip.  He thought it tasted better than ""typical"" sake and suggests that you try it too.",8GlLooElGwaL0WNkunHgvw,3,1,5,O_mQcsZwSOUqGpNLrwpIsg

I ordered a california roll and it could have not been more simple, but   to my unfortunate surprise there was wasabi in my sushi, which I learned later is the traditional and accurate way to make sushi. 

I personally hate wasabi and can't eat anything spicy, so to have an unexpected pinch of wasabi in my meal was like a punch to the face. I ate the forth piece of sushi and ended my meal there, cause it was just too spicy for my taste buds to finish. 

I suppose I've been spoiled by places like Kabuki and Yama Sushi, which do not put wasabi in your rolls, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time. Anywho, everything was fine and the prices are fair and next time I'll know what to ask for.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,1,1,3,A2ylZdCtjNWKMcWMY0My5w
4217321,2014-09-08,0,NkuLKJJE_KxcxKs8Kj8thQ,"First of all, this is not one of those AYCE sushi places. Personally, there is nothing wrong about those type of places if all you want is quantity. Yamaguchi Sushi is more of a Mom & Pop type of place. 
I was with my family (Mother & Brother) and decided that a nice Japanese dinner would be a good idea. As soon as we enter the restaurant we were greeted by Ken (the owner) & a friendly Japanese waitress (always a good sign at a Japanese restaurant). We were immediately taken to a nice table near the sushi bar. Next we were informed about certain items that were not available (due to being sold out / the vendor was not able to provide a quality product). I know that some individuals would be upset about this. Personally, I commend an establishment that would rather not have an item(s) than to try and provide a product that may or may not be satisfactory. 
On with the order: Everyone started with some complimentary edamame which was very tasty. My mother ordered the combination dinner (Salmon & Shrimp Tempura), brother had a couple of specialty sushi rolls that Ken recommended, & I had the combination (Sashimi & Teriyaki Beef). The presentation was very nice and the food was freshly prepared. When I received the check, I was pleasantly surprised that the meal cost far less than an AYCE place (dinner prices).

Our top picks from the menu were the tootsie roll, rainbow roll, and lava roll. Other selections are also very pleasant, but I could be here all day praising their menu. Most importantly, you can taste the freshness of every roll.
They also offer complimentary soybeans at the beginning of the meal, which was a pleasant and sufficient appetizer over casual conversation.

5783356,2012-12-07,0,NkuLKJJE_KxcxKs8Kj8thQ,"I normally hate to give negative reviews about anything, having worked for many years in the service industry myself.  Unfortunately, the experience I had here tonight compels me to share my thoughts regarding this restaurant.   As a bit of context, I am a Las Vegas local and have tried many sushi restaurants in the area.  I would go back to any of them before I come back here. 

Food:  Average, at best.  The edamame was served cold - the first time I've ever been served cold edamame in a restaurant.  Further, there was no creativity with the rolls. The flavors were simply fish and rice with nothing to bring out the flavor of the tuna, salmon, or eel.  The heavy use of green onions, chives, and spices overpowered the sushi rather than having a pleasant mix of heat to bring out the natural flavor of the dish.  You'll find a much better variety and more complex flavors in other places.  

Atmosphere:  Simplistic and uninviting.  The setup is merely a  waist-high sushi bar with approximately 10 tables crowded into a narrow space.  Decorations were sparse, and the lighting was more akin to a dim office environment.   It wasn't dirty. But the layout and the colors don't make you feel comfortable either.  

Service:  Sadly, the worst part of the meal.  As a note, my girlfriend and I did not sit at the bar.  Thus, we were not served by the owner, Ken, that is referenced in other reviews here.  Instead we were served by a very young looking girl - the only server there that night.  Besides two gentlemen at the sushi bar, my girlfriend and I were the only ones there.  We had to actually ask for the separate menu that listed the sushi rolls.  You would think a server in a SUSHI restaurant would have the presence of mind to give SUSHI menus with the regular menus.  We also had to ask for plates. And silverware.  And dishes to pour the soy sauce/wasabi into.  And, although she hovered uncomfortably around the table (during what was obviously supposed to be an intimate meal between my girlfriend and I), waiting to snatch and refill my water like a kitten on a ball of yarn, when we needed to pay for the meal, she was nowhere around to give us our check.  She was there when we didn't want her there and not there when we needed her.

Price:  Overly priced, but not egregiously.  There's no all you can eat menu (not atypical in Las Vegas).  But even the simplest rolls were a couple dollars too much for what you get.   We went there because we had a $10 coupon gift through restaurant.com.  Turns out if you use that coupon, you have to spend at least $20 (somewhat understandable) and they will force you to pay an 18% tip, regardless of the size of your party.  It's a cheap and misleading tactic that defeats the purpose of the coupon.  I normally tip 20%.  But I don't want to feel forced to tip - especially when it's not a large size party.

Bottom line: Go to ANY other sushi place in Las Vegas.",pEcHu9lR-LxvBeZN1Iv2eg,0,0,1,GaGwRAoncmMYWwNUIYqsOQ
