I ordered the chili cheese burger.  I was really disappointed with   The meal.   The burger and chilli didn't compliment each other.  Don't order it.  I also tried The chilli dog and that was delicious.  They got the old school French fries.  The people are very friendly,  the setup of the diner was a new experience for me.  Cash only,  ""I couldn't find a letter"".     

This yelper is a fan of , fruit, and veggies",_8vwycmIKNB-iXNm5tjC4w,0,0,2,8PsxdOqm5JgzS9QUjghuPw

Best decision I've made. The portions are generous, and the prices are ridiculously cheap. It's tradition for me to take friends and family there now. Great place",b3eOMo38Dh_TJtchFXEyKw,0,0,5,L9KMNEFbwwT_5-T5GGoEUQ

The place is small and definitely not fancy, but that is what one would expect from a hole in the wall like this. The food however is unexpectedly good. The portions are large and the prices are small. We will definitely be back to this new favorite.",AJh8SVTuQW0pcE3LKs8OSw,0,0,4,1BQPjx1MIp_cvAgZg_jJOw

The service was excellent. Loved the signs on the walls.

Went in for a cheap breakfast and got a GOOD, cheap breakfast.

I was, however, not a huge fan of their chocolate milk OR hashbrowns.
Sometimes I wish shredded hashbrowns were ILLEGAL.

If you want a sit down meal for a few bucks, go here. It's obviously not fancy, but the wait staff is so bored they HAVE to check on you.",iyhqoE49PTX2VNITzpDw6w,1,1,3,4EYJ8P8wMSNXd3RmMYTyHQ
1703277,2015-06-23,0,nEJYfCtVM44qFknVSLb4Ug,Love the old truck stop.. so much history and lots of story telling from the elders.  Great food and good people.

1883395,2007-03-21,5,nEJYfCtVM44qFknVSLb4Ug,"Wow!  This is the true blue truck stop hidden behind Wendy's.  
Yellow and red placard on the wall announce all the specials and another sign lets you know that they have homemade macaroni and potato salad.
All the tables and booths were filled with truck drivers.  I imagined Large Marge coming around the corner any second.  They have an array of cheeseburger sizes and the 1/2 pound we got seemed enormous.  The prices were beyond reasonable. It was a true blue truck stop cheeseburger served up by a sweet little old lady.  The fries were nothing spectacular and the side salad I had was good.  I  will return, if for nothing else to experience a true americana experience.  
I will be back again for some rib sticking biscuits and gravy and apple pancakes.",9Zc5GTXVB3Jd-afLk-7-9g,5,2,3,tneG65iU4ggikD63rrB0Fg
1960361,2016-10-24,1,nEJYfCtVM44qFknVSLb4Ug,"Im giving this place one star because of the service. The food is really good and very reasonably priced. When my husband and I walked in we were not greeting by any of the 3 employees. Keep in mind this was our first time. So we assumed that we seated ourselves. The waitress who's name was Kennedy walked over, placed the menu's down and walked away. They're were 3 other customers there who I believe were either her friends or family that she continued to talk to and laugh with. When she came back she said ""what do ya'll want to drink and eat."" We told her and she walked away again and continued what she was doing before. While we were waiting for our food she called across the cafe and said to my husband and I, ""if you're wondering what is going on, i have a really huge crush on the guy that just walked out."" I believe the guy she was referring was another employee. My husband and I looked at each other and told her we would like to take our food to go and went ahead and paid. When we recieved our food she never once said thank you or have a good night. I'm use to people being rude in Vegas but we have never experienced such bad service",efCmzE74k98NUx9xcrLIhA,1,0,1,cRlUgJ9FfIJJcEhEpe8zcw

3230950,2016-11-11,0,nEJYfCtVM44qFknVSLb4Ug,"Well this place is a typical dive joint. Still being said they could do better by having the waitresses keep their taco bell and Starbucks cups of coffee lying on a table in the middle of a resturant and making that area there unofficial brake room lol. The food was meh... it was cheap though, 6.95 for Patty melt and tea. The waitress was attentive but I will definitely never come back to this joint unless I Wana take a shot on the breakfast menu. I'm a sucker for good biscuits and gravy and that have that here. But skip this joint, seek your burger needs else where!!",D3fOi-5w4intrUTWXzIQew,0,0,2,3Gz373ub_FzRWuEN3zaFOQ

I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy for $5.75. AWESOME! . You can't judge a book by its cover on this one because honestly mavericks isn't much to look at.

The Service was good, Waitress seemed to know everyone who walked in the door. The ambiance reminds me of burger joints i use to go to as a child. I had the 1lb burger which was awesome! My girlfriend had their chicken wings and fries which were also surprisingly goood!

Stuff I've tried:
Biscuits and Gravy
Eggs (scrambled, omelet, over-easy, and sunny side up, all good)
Sausage (if you see it, TRY IT - homemade and delicious)
Grilled Cheese (also with ham)
Hash browns
Corned beef hash
Onion rings
Texas toast

Really, you can't go wrong. Also, take note - they're cash only.",ws8IZY4rPFeneTcrZvTRNw,1,2,5,O4VblIYAvH60xX38FYtQ5A
