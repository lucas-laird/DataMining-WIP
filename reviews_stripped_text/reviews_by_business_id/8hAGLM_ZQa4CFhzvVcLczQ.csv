157606,2015-12-22,0,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,Really bad live music last Friday night.  Two of us went there Friday the18th but didn't stay as long as we intended because couldn't stand listening to female singer.  Singing voice was really irritating and she couldn't play guitar very well.  Nice restaurant and bar.

342449,2015-12-12,0,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,Went here last night with my girlfriend at 745pm to check it out for the first time. We walk in to see 5 or 6 tables of people in eating and we're confronted by a employee saying that they're done serving food and would be closing soon. I was thoroughly confused because it says right on the door they close at 9pm. It came off lazy and sounded like they just wanted an early out. We went to brio. Then we're open. They were packed. I hope management jumps on this issue if not I don't think they'll last very long.,MtdLOss-rZ69ZUPcUBqe5g,0,0,2,M9wKwvvHJ7HP7kjz9HL2gg

Your adorable signage, really great live entertainment and quality service simply could not make up for your terrible product. I'm not being sarcastic when I say ""didn't you do market research?"" To begin with, Lucilles is just down the street. Lucilles. The place where you can get 90% of the things you have listed on your menu at a better price, better quality, in bigger portions and with better flavor. Also, you're marketing to patrons of Tivoli village. The people who go to Tivoli are looking for upscale or at least unique dining experiences. Finally, did you not consider the fact that you're opening a restaurant in Las Vegas, a place where world class dining experiences are available 24/7 nearly anywhere you go?
I'm just so confused why you would start the dining experience with a laminated piece of paper that you clearly printed off your home computer and call it your menu? Really, its like the first thing your guests see. Then you under cook the complementary biscuits? Those are really important items that set the tone for the whole dining experience. I can think of several restaurants that I say ""ohh lets go there, the complementary _______ (bread, biscuits, chips etc.) are so delicious.""
Luckily with all these warning signs by the time my entree arrived I was prepared for the worst. My rubbery, maybe 3 oz, chicken breast sandwich on a store bought bun tasted like something I could have prepared in 5 minutes on my George Foreman grill. Members of my family suffered through their catfish that was still swimming (swimming in sauce that is) and pulled pork sandwich (admit it, the pulled pork was from Costco).
I will say the cob, fried chicken and pecan salad was decent. Thank goodness as that's what the culinary south is known for, right, salad? Where is the roll eye emoji when I need it?!
So. Why am I being so mean? Because!! I want nothing more than for people to be successful. I say it repetitively throughout my reviews. However, people can be so stupid! This restaurant is disappointing and just the worst and now when it fails the person or people who made the investment are going to be all ""Wahhh! I failed at business feel sorry for me and let me go bankrupt and leech off of all the people in the world."" 
When you closed your eyes and envisioned your business, is this seriously what you saw? And when you saw this in your vision, you honestly thought ""yeah, that's the kind of place that's going to last?"" You did this to yourselves people. You had potential. You could have done it. Somewhere along the line though you decided to go cheap, boring, lazy or you forgot to go to culinary school. Try harder.",_NDAvCY4lWvnBFfdVm_6hA,7,6,1,PzqsHtjIcCShzE-XLlEf4A
362218,2016-01-19,0,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,"Well the curse of the Village strikes again. What is it about this area, it is a ghost town no matter what time of day.

We went for dinner at 5:30 and we were the only table in the place. We should have turned around when trying to open the door and it wouldn't open. The service was horrible and very slow. I think the server was doing everything in the place.

The gumbo was ok, lots of rice and no soup. The deviled eggs were gross and for $7 you should get more than 3 tiny pieces. The fried pickles were GROSS and we sent them back. The Mac and Cheese was horrible, you get better at the deli counter of any Albertsons. Chicken sandwich was tasteless, how do you mess up a chicken sandwich? The fries were frozen. The shrimp on the po boy were good but that is about it.

There is no way this place will be open very long. We certainly will never be back. About the only thing in the Village that has any business is Brio.

Try any place in Downtown Summerlin for a better dinner out.",0zLud2NYlZhcIlREOLXomw,1,0,1,IE_bqwipE3hlg-K5cUSEpA

The young woman at the door asked a manager type if they had Happy Hour.  
He tersely told us that they did not.....even though it's advertised that they do have HH which he admitted.....he didn't invite us in to try the menu; he didn't suggest a free app because of the error; he was just rude.  They lost four customers that dine out at Tivoli and Downtown Summerlin often.

It is such a beautiful center and everytime we go it seems that nobody is there.  Hard for us to understand.  Anyhow we saw Salt and Pepper and thought it was maybe owned by the folks that own Salt and Honey so decided to give it a try.  It was about 1:30pm on a weekday and the place was empty.  Made us wonder what was up... anyhow the east European server was really great and as we were the only ones there she was very attentive and very nice.  I wanted a burger and fries and my wife ordered the shrimp jambalaya and deviled eggs... we ordered a bottle of a very decent Cabernet at a very good price and we both shared our orders with one another.  We were both very satisfied with the quality and portion sizes.  We both thought the honey biscuits were delicious, and I finished it off with the icebox lemon meringue pie and a black coffee which were great!  I was shocked to read some of the reviews and how some thought everything was terrible.  We cook a lot at home and are food channel addicted and think we have a better than average feel for food of all types. Our check total was certainly not out of line at all and we felt it a decent value.  It is unfortunate that the location is where it is...and the shape of the place is like a train car... the hostess seemed ready to fall asleep and barely looked up as we entered and when we left. However otherwise we found the food and service quite good and would eat there again.

1529319,2015-11-15,1,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,"My husband and I were driving by Tivoli when we saw a sign for this place, so I pulled it up on Yelp and realized it was their grand opening. Looked at the menu and my husband did a U turn so we could check it out. We were seated right away with out a reservation, which was great. We got there before the dinner rush. The place is very welcoming, and the staff was very friendly. I loved the desk with the collection of vintage salt and pepper shakers. Would of been cool to see something like that on the tables instead of plain plastic ones. I was really excited to try the Chicken and dumpling soup, but the waitress informed me they were out, bummer. Running out of an item on your first night open? Interesting. Luckily there were plenty of yummy sounding items to try. We ordered the baked BBQ 1/2 chicken, Maple n Bacon Baked Beans, Homemade cornbread, and the baked cheddar mac n cheese. While we were waiting, the lights dimmed down, and started flickering, annoyingly. The staff seemed to notice, but nothing was done, or could be done to remedy this. They have their biscuits to order on the menu, but FYI they bring you a basket of them before you get your food. We found a hair on a biscuit, which happens, but not off to a great start so far. We weren't a huge fan of these. Kind of hard, and not very warm at all.  I did notice they looked like they were in a heart shape, which if so, I loved! Our corn bread came out way before the rest of our food, and it was in a skillet, but completely cold. Would of preferred it warm and served with the rest of our meal. The chicken was so delicious! Juicy and soft, and just so good. It would of been nice to have a small dish of BBQ sauce to dip it in, but this was by far the best thing we ordered. The baked beans had slices of sausage in it, which was a welcoming surprise. I give the beans a thumbs up along with the chicken. The mac n cheese was way too rich for both of us, but that is just our taste. Some people might really be into that. All the sides were served in miniature stoneware, which were adorable. In the end we weren't super impressed with the food, but we will be back to try the soup and banana pudding for sure!",t9-xBrh_1JYcBjwHEJtMgw,1,0,3,97nf9JhdX7Duy525Vcsu6Q

1645747,2016-01-15,15,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,"It's like this location is cursed. This is the third business to be here in recent memory, and the new Southern-influenced menu doesn't really fit the decor or the location. Made LV is in the same plaza with many similar dishes and better execution.

Appetizers are a smorgasbord of fried snacks. Fried pickles had a thin batter, but were very greasy with very little dipping sauce. Deviled eggs are just three pieces to an order, which is odd (pun!) and difficult to share... and they were very basic. The lemon meringue ice box pie was awesome though, and is the only reason I planned a return visit.

But they were closed. Apparently now their hours are dinner service only, 4-8PM. Which is ridiculous, as I was there the night before and discussed the lunch menu salads with the bartender who helped me. She suggested a specific salad and made no mention of the fact that they're no longer even open for lunch... So when I went by during lunch and discovered the closed storefront, I ended up taking my business to Leone instead.  

Service was fairly friendly, otherwise.. But nothing about this place really seems to fit. 
As an added irritation, prices are being revised, with two or three different versions of the menu and costs circulating around the restaurant at once, making the final bill a surprise.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,14,2,Hg5wwIhy25QEyoFJbfyXQQ

Well we decided to give this place a try seeing as it was new and who doesn't love comfort food! Well let's just say we were extremely disappointed. We asked the waitress what beers they had on tap and she said ""I don't know I just started my shift"" and then stared at us with this blank look. We said we'd get up and look, which she then said she would go check. We ordered the fried pickles and we're really bummed to find out they were out of them. We got there at 6 on a Friday night and it was dead, how could they already be out of something? So instead we ordered the Mac n cheese balls, which were pretty bland. We had to ask for plates to eat them on. I ordered the shrimp po boy and my boyfriend got the chicken n waffles. The shrimp tasted like it was going bad and was the frozen breaded kind you get at a fast food chain (not naming any names). Needless to say I didn't finish it. The best part of the meal were the biscuits! Pretty disappointed with this place.",0BCOQS0PbtCeiTtJtuQwHg,1,0,2,9umIPv4k7RpVk3M0DWiOLQ

We had the ribs which the meat fell off the bone. I had the pulled pork which was equally delicious. You get biscuits with honey butter and OMG heaven. I'm not a big drinker but the Long Island ice tea was the best I've had ever. To top things off we shared the banana fosters pudding. Let me tell you this is BEYOND words.

We ordered the fried tomatoes, po-boy sandwich and chicken fingers. My husband doesn't ever complain. The other review comparing it to long john silvers was GENEROUS. It was gross. The bread was a hot dog bun.

Please read my other reviews and understand that I am not being rude, and that this is an accurate and honest review.

The service was horrible, as you can see from my aforementioned comment it began from the start. There were TWO other guests in the restaurant plus the two of us - so FOUR total diners. It took 10 minutes for drinks and 15 minutes after that before we could order. I have no idea where the waitress was. 

The food. I can't.

We ordered the Mac N' Cheese bites, which were probably popped into the fryer after they've been frozen for a week. 

We also ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy which was a 6/10. Not bad, not good. Eh. 

We also ordered the cardiac arrest, excuse me, the biscuits and gravy. Holy salt, batman. Not only did they have more salt than the Pacific Ocean, they had the weirdest taste that I'll never be able to forget.

2716937,2015-12-16,6,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,"My entire family lives in th South, so southern food is close to my heart.  The food here was a tasty and reasonably close second to making the long trip home.

When we entered the restaurant, there was just two other couples there, but within about 15 minutes of arriving, the place began to fill up.  The service was very polite, but also slow.  I had the impression they either misplaced our order, ended up with it behind orders that came after ours, or they messed up one of our dishes and had to prepare it again.  As we sat, we watched other parties get served, several of which were seated quite a bit of time after we were.  If we were in a hurry it would have been a problem.  I never asked why it was taking so long because we had time to sit.  I was curious to see just how this would unfold.  The waiter never explained why our meals were taking so long, but once everything arrived, it was delicious.  

The waiter brought Honey Butter Biscuits to the table and we ordered the Fried Pickles with spicy ranch dressing to get us started.  They serve pickle chips rather than spears and they were some of the best I've had outside of visiting my family.  

My son had the chicken tenders for lunch.  There was a generous number of them, and they were some of the fattest chicken strips I've seen served anywhere--a huge hit with him, and we ended up taking half of them home.  My wife had the Good ol' Fashioned Shrimp Po' Boy and I had the Blackened Catfish with a side of Collard Greens (with Ham Hocks).  Everything was delicious, and the fish was cooked perfectly.  My only criticism of the fish was the seasoning.  It had decent flavor, but no spice whatsoever.  Back home when you order fish ""blackened"", there's usually a bite to the seasoning.  I was also a little surprised they didn't bring a bottle of vinegar to the table with the greens though.  This is a standard condiment in just about every southern restaurant that serves greens back home.  Even without the vinegar though, these greens were totally legit.

My wife and I had sweet tea to drink, which thankfully wasn't overly sweet.  One thing I've noticed about ""southern"" restaurants outside of the South:  they tend to turn sweet tea into a syrupy symbol of the South--almost a joke.  Salt 'N Pepper does it right.  The tea was sweet, enjoyable and refreshing rather than tea-colored sugar water.  It was served in tall, skinny glasses with lots of ice.

Our drinks weren't refilled until they were empty, which meant we had to either flag the waiter down, or wait without beverages until he noticed we were out.  Thankfully we never had to wait long, but it seemed that he didn't want to keep drinks topped off and would rather wait until it was clear we wanted more.  I'm not sure why, but think they should serve the tea in larger classes or keep them full.

Finally, in addition to the indoor seating, there's a generous outdoor seating area.  Take advantage of it when the weather permits.

On this first visit, Salt 'N Pepper came across as almost trying too hard, or being too careful.  I think they're the third restaurant to occupy this space in the relatively short time this part of Tivoli Village has been opened, so there may be a specter of pressure to succeed.  I don't know.  I do know this though:  it was good enough that we'll go back to try more of the items on the menu!  I hope you'll give it a try too.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,7,7,3,SAMOCpEShzC7B61GXkUHwA
2793410,2015-11-25,0,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,"Fortunately, what is bad about this place is very fixable. The decor was very warm and nice. The service was very good, we were checked on multiple times and everyone was very pleasant. Unfortunately, the food was extremely lackluster. The problem with it isn't the cooking process or presentation, but rather, the sheer flavor (or lack thereof). 

We ordered a bevy of food, but unfortunately the only notable dish was the pulled pork sandwich which maintained a good balance of flavors between the meat and coleslaw. My pork chop with apple chutney was mostly bone and tendon/sinew, and the chutney was the only source of flavor in the dish; the breading and pork had no flavor/seasoning, and the mashed potatoes it sat upon had no distinct characteristics outside of lumpy (not salty, not creamy, not seasoned, just nothing). Again the same could be said of the collard greens, just nothing to justify someone making it for you with how absolutely plain and average it tasted. 

The yams tasted, again, simplistic; no distinguishable tastes outside of the sweet potato itself and the marshmallows that sat atop the dish. The macaroni and cheese bites looked the best from a presentational aspect, but again there was zero discernable flavor. It was haunted by the ghost of cheese rather than embracing any form of gooey cheese-ness; the sauce they serve with it on the side was the only way they became palatable, but again the sauce seemed to be inspired by cheese rather than containing actual cheese.

I will hopefully return in a couple months to see if they've improved at all; I sincerely hope they will. The issues they have seem to only stem from one main source: their recipes just exude no noteworthy flavor. Their staff deserve a better rating than the two stars I am giving it, but the staff and ambiance are the only reason it received the additional star.",DuzQa5gh0qll2bFRoBpDiQ,1,0,2,xO-2YsXLoTgvNoinYgEEGQ

In addition to the few people at the bar, there were only 2 occupied tables in the dining room. The occupancy did not increase the entire time we dined.
Service was a little slow when we sat down. Once our server arrived we asked some questions about the wines. The list had only 3 types. Our sever was not knowledgeable of the wines and required two trips to the bar to get the requested information. They actually had more choices then shown on the menu. 

Dinner arrived in a timely period. The order of chicken tenders was a large portion and is served with french fries. The tenders were under seasoned and the fries were fairly ordinary.
The chicken, shrimp and andouille jambalaya was served in a bowl that was super hot. Our served advised not to touch the bowl. I prefer piping hot over cool but this meal required many minutes before I could taste it. The flavor was great and a nice mix of ingredients. This meal was large enough to take some home.

3517321,2016-01-04,4,8hAGLM_ZQa4CFhzvVcLczQ,"Quickly taking over the short lived Tapas, Alex Stratta may have come up with a concept with more staying power than its predecessor. Serving up classic American fare/southern comfort food, this new spot addresses Tapas's two biggest issues: price and portion size. Entrees here are all under $20 and portions for not only entrees but for apps are large enough to satisfy most appetites. There is some overlap in concept to their neighbor a few doors down -- Made LV -- but this spot takes things farther down south for the bulk of their menu. 

I dined at Salt 'n Pepper during their opening week and it was evident that they were still finding their way. Warm biscuits with honey butter were dense, thick and dry. Without asking, the kitchen sent out a second batch because they weren't happy with the first that left the kitchen. It was good to see the chefs care that much, although the second round was too doughy for my liking.

They've got a kid's menu, with 4 large crispy tenders that my kid loved and accompanied by thick cut fries.

Always a sucker for chicken 'n waffles, I had to try their version. With a drumstick and two thighs, the exterior of each was coated with a thin and crispy crust aggressively seasoned with pepper. Less successful was the soft and pliable sweet potato waffle that failed to hold up to the weight of the chicken. Topping it off was a maple syrup and an excellent hot sauce that had enough heat to stir up the palate without destroying it.

Both desserts sampled were traditional takes on classics -- a red velvet cake and a pecan pie with bourbon sour cream.  The pair may not have pushed any culinary boundaries, but were executed well.

There are minor changes to the interior, but it looks similar to Tapas. Still, for a spot that's seen Greek, Asian fusion, Spanish, and now Southern, the interior looks to be in good shape. With some fine tuning Salt 'n Pepper has the chance to last longer than any of those.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,7,3,CzCXO-j_SROyzSj8z-B0-Q

The decorations are cute.  The drinks were not good.  No copper mugs for the Moscow mules and no lime taste at all.  The old fashioned tasted like a shirley temple.  The biscuits they give you were good but cold.  We weren't excited for the food based on the drinks but we had already ordered.  It was not seasoned well. We won't be coming back.",lhGOisBdflANbXOKEOo_Xg,4,1,2,3j1uJLpy0srpBP2C5FRuYQ

She claimed she knew what she was doing because she watched her dad growing up. Obviously she has no idea. Dumb people think they know.

Don't get the Southern Collard Greens.  It is unusually bitter.  Portion is big enough for sharing but the taste is bad.

Shrimp Po'Boy the batter is good and the bread is toasted right.  There are few shrimps in it.  The cut fries are big portion.  So a lot of carbs, not a lot of meat.

Nothing amazing or special that makes me want to come back.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,1,0,3,G3fShYhRU-jF13L3Ww-2UQ

Shrimp sandwich tasted like breaded frozen type with corn meal coating. They were out of several items, too many for a new place. Biscuits were delicious. I will stick to Cantina or Brio when at Tivoli.",u2-EfmqihfkhmolhhelTdw,0,0,2,Xg9o3dOLXJnF3mh3qIKaDw
