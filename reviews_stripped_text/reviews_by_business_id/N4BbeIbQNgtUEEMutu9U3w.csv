20794,2012-03-25,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"Wanted to try Famous Dave's but never got around to it-until now.

I visited this location on a Saturday afternoon, it was nice and quiet. The server was extremely friendly and helpful, he gave us a sample of all the sauces they offer (5 if I remember correctly) and was very attentive.

Very big portions, even for the appetizers; we got Southside Rib Tips, that's 1 lb of ribs cooked to perfection, so juicy and tender the meat fell off the bone! That alone would be more than enough to feed 1 person!

I tried the Georgia Chopped Pork and Beef Brisket. The Chopped Pork was amazing, so tender and juicy and the burnt crispy bits so flavorful. The amount of sauce was just right, not too much that it drowned the taste of the meat and just enough to accent the smokiness and create a smooth blend of flavors. The Beef Brisket was cooked to perfection, juicy and smoky. Both were served on a slice of toast bread. 

The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the portions. I will definitely be visiting Famous Dave's more often!",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,1,2,5,haUHDJ9BzL-MmeRSTIqvzA

I found out our servers name by looking at the receipt because she didn't introduce herself. I'm not going to put her on blast, but she needs some help with service and friendliness. We started with the catfish which was good and quick to hit the table.. Then we waited. And waited.. My girlfriend stopped our server to make sure she put in our entree order because we didn't finish the catfish (we were planning to take it home) and she snapped back with an unfriendly response. When our food finally arrived, it was just ok. The drunken apples we ordered had no ""juice"" in it so they came out cold and sort of dry. Everything else was ok. We ordered a bread pudding to go because we didn't want to wait any longer for service and our bread pudding came out without the heating sticker, when I asked her for the sticker she replied with ""I'll check to see if we have any but all you have to do is put it in the microwave for a minute and 30 seconds"" then, when I read the sticker it was different.

132728,2013-11-09,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"After 3 absolutely horrible experiences at this location, I have finally made the decision to leave this review. It makes my skin crawl to be ""that person"" right now, as I work in the service industry, but it's not a coincidence that every time I come here, I wish I had gone somewhere else.
The first time my boyfriend and I came, we were new to the area and weren't sure what to expect. We waited at the empty host's stand for a long while before someone finally walked by. They just smiled and walked to the back. After another minute of waiting, someone finally emerged from the bar area and sat us quickly and quietly. Our server was so-so. Nice, but slow and unattentive in a pretty empy section. Dropped our food and we didn't see her once until she gave us the check. Then we waited another 10 minutes for her to run our card. The food was good enough to bring us back a second time, though. 
Round two consisted of us being rushed to our seats by a man who we assumed was a manager. He was pretty rude and short, and just seemed all around miserable. Our server eventually took over and it was the usual food drop and dissapear move. It was an alright experience until the booth behind us left. We were sat right next to the register and could clearly hear our server and who we assumed was the manager complaining about how they didn't tip on a large tab. I 100% understand that feeling, but I would never complain about it on the floor, right in direct earshot of other guests. To top it off, they got so riled up that they began dropping all kinds of curse words. Maybe if she had a better attitude, she would have been getting better tip results.
Currently, we're sitting in a corner booth, deciding how to tip our server after our third visit. Our server sat us and started the conversation with drinks and all that jazz. Very short and rude, which seems to be the pattern here. After taking my order, my boyfriend waited for her to ask for his order, because it's only polite while someone is still writing the previous order down. She looked at him all of a sudden and gestured rudely with her hands for him to speak. He said, ""Oh, I didn't know you were ready for my order yet."" She snorted and said, ""Well, it's only you two here so...""
We got our food, which was great as usual, and about a minute later she dropped the bill and walked away. Annoyed, we took our time. She loitered around the bar with nothing to do and eventaully we gave her our card to pay. She had her jacket on and her purse was sitting on the bartop while she watched my boyfriend sign the reciept. He hadn't even put down the pen when she grabbed her copy and left. As she closed out a till it dawned on me that she might have been a manager of some sort as well, which makes it ten times worse. The only person doing their job today was the host. She held the door and gave us a smile when we entered and left. We're tipping $3 and even that seems like too much. Definitely finding another location after our third dissapointment in a row.",_T0R0IlbE6bY0mrzWV41-Q,0,0,1,u0rAS6ilkBjERg-2ipiLsA

We all had the same food.  Only I had tried the sauces.  You know the ones on the table.  Big mistake!!  I got food poisoning and spent a night in the bathroom and two days in bed.

Well a friend of mine just went there and guess what? Yep got sick.  I am not sure if they know that leaving open sauce bottles is an invitation for people to lick their finger while trying the sauces.  Perhaps they don't understand that kids and adults alike may not wash their hands.  Product does break down after time.  When was the last time those bottles were washed?  Whatever the problem is needs to be fixed before a surprise inspection happens.

The place needs to be clean not just wiped down.  Sauce needs to be dispensed at customers request not just sitting on the table for anyone to stick their nasty finger on the end and take a taste.

One thing I really hate when dining out is for my drink glass to go empty for any length of time. Well, the friendly staff here kept me in Coca Cola. You will certainly get good service but the reason I went here was for the food.

Alright, when I spend upwards of $15 per person I expect world class cooking and even though the food here is generally edible, it was a long way from world class. I thought the cornbread muffin thingy was closer to a rock then food. The Brisket I had came on one piece of soggy bread. 

Yes, check this out, I ordered the Beef Brisket because I wanted a barbecue beef sandwich. Not a child's portion of meat that sat on top of a piece of soggy bread. Sandwiches come with two pieces of bread not one. 

The other disappointment, the small portions. All total my Brisket was was about 3 inches by 3.5 inches. Then I had a miniature piece of corn and less coleslaw then one would get at Popeyes Chicken. All in all I was hungry not 30 minutes after I left. Now, the Devil's Spit sauce is good, their food is tasty, but not world class.

The stench from the urine smell tells me they don't keep it clean. I'm sorry, but if you can't keep a restroom tidy on a slow day then going on a busy day would not be advised.

Let me tell you what happened.

The first time we had a problem, I came with my mother who is IN LOVE with the ribs. They are usually super tender and very easy to chew. She has dental problems, so this was a wonderful spot for her to enjoy yummy good food. However, on this particular day, the ribs were so tough and even not fully cooked. So we asked for new meat, and they gave us the same stuff. Very hard to eat meat. Nobody in our section ate their ribs, but if course, the waitress wasn't paying attention.

Anyways, we filled out a comment card thing online and the manager ended up calling the very next day. Super cool man who apologized and really cared about our feedback. He even sent us a wonderful gift of $30 in the mail for us to comeback. Sweet.

Anyways, today....we came to dine in.
Our waitress didn't even ask for what we wanted to drink until 10-15 mins after we were seated.

We ordered the BBQ for $22, we wanted to try the ribs again along with brisket. I ONLY COME HERE FOR BRISKET, IT'S MY FAVORITE. And I also had a coupon for a free dessert and a free sandwich for signing up on their membership email thing.

We got our platter and everything was tough to eat and dry. Except for the chicken. It was wonderful. We told our waitress and she just decided to bring us new meat. There was absolutely no difference in the meat we had and the meat she brought us. It was just smothered in BBQ sauce. 

Actually, another character brought us our meat. I don't know if she's a floor supervisor or what. But she wasn't dressed like a serve. She didn't even apologize.. 

We had only ate the chicken on the platter, and were still hungry. My mother decided to order the nachos from happy hour, which came with almost nothing of cheese...... 

By the way, at this time, my mother's drink was all watered down and needed a refill. Did the waitress ask if we needed refills? No.

Anyways, next thing you know, 5 minutes after the nachos were delivered, the waitress brought me my dessert in a to-go box. At this point, my mom and I felt really uncomfortable and almost as if they were rushing us.. I didn't wanna be there anymore. So we didn't say anything.

Once we asked our server for the check, she said in a very rude and exhausted voice, ""with all your discounts and coupons tonight, we decided to take care of the rest"". She didn't even give us a receipt....but I guess it's fine. She never even said her name to us and I have no proof of us ever going because she did not give us a receipt.

My mom and I left there with hungry stomachs, a headache, and a bad taste in our mouths. What the heck happened to good ol' Famous Dave's that fostered a family friendly environment?! We were treated as second hand citizens because we had a comp and coupons. Very unacceptable.

So now we have popped everything in a slow cooker. Hopefully we can eat it tomorrow.",VzlguLcMuwymWo1pEXJeeA,2,0,2,cEdhyabgQ2kmuChCR7EASA

Yeah, they do have a replica of the Salt Lick at Red Rock Hotel & Casino, but i'm afraid to try to it b/c it may not be the same as the original.  plus, i dont see a bbq pit anywhere.  anyways, i would have to say Famous Dave's is pretty good, but not the best i've ever had.  the biggest plus about this place is that they have southern sweet tea.  ooh, nice and sugary ice tea quenching your thirst while waiting for those mouthwatering ribs.  yeah, i recommend the pound of rib tips.  this is the first time ive ordered chopped up bite-size moist fatty pieces of rib tips that are covered in the Rich and Sassy bbq sauce.  it is tangy but a bit too much on the sweet side.  i usually add the Devil's Spit to add some fire to my ribs or tips in this case.  i also like the uniquely vinegary Georgia Mustard.  this is the only place where i can order just rib tips.  i love how easy this is to eat with just a fork. you don't have to get messy.  i will definitely come back to this place for this dish.  they have a great side dish selection.  i always have to order the sweet drunkin ' apples, the classic sweet corn bread, the buttery wet corn-on-the-cob, and my absolute favorite the extremely garlic creamed mashed potatoes with the red skin whipped in (this was insanely delicious).  they look like they have a good dessert menu...i.e. pecan pie and hot fudge Kahlua brownie, but my tummy is so damn full from stuffing my face with juicy rib tips, and all those mouthwatering sides.  It's no wonder they one first place in the in 18th annual ''Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook off'' in Reno this year.  so if you're looking for some good ribs from a chain, i recommend this place.  it hella better than eating ribs at Tony Roma's, or any of the casino bbq places.  but keep reading as i look for the best rib place in vegas...",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,2,2,3,OROzRQJTxy3zffKqriPHqw

I look around and there are napkins, straw wrappers and all kinds of stuff on the floor under all the tables.  At this time I'm totally grossed out trying not to analyze the cleanliness of everything as everything you touch is sticky....and I'm concentrating on not moving my feet too much.  Gosh.

This place has been a hit and miss for us so its been a long time since we have been here.  We order the Feast for 2 for $36 not remembering the SECRET Que for 2 for $20.  Big fat (pun intended) bummer cuz holy crap this is ALOT of food.  It should really say for 3 to 4 people.  Needless to say I know what I'll be having for lunch today! We brought half this meal home.

Came all piled on an old trash can lid:
Ribs - hit and miss here but this time they were great! The meat came right off the bone.
Brisket - about 6 leathery pieces of not so tender meat on top of stale Texas toast (def not my fave)
Chicken breast - cooked perfectly and very tasty
Wilber beans - awesome flavor with little chunks of meat...yum!
4 pieces of corn - um yeah for the two of us.  It was amazingly great.
Wedge fries - always one of my faves to try out all their sauces
2 corn muffins - consistently yummy and moist
Cole slaw - didn't even have any but it looked good

So the food was pretty good...better than the last time we were here. The service was good and the waitress was attentive and very friendly.  The place is not clean unfortunately especially the floor.  Ick.  The silverwear is really really old and flimsy.  Perhaps they should spend the money on some new silverwear rather than the front entrance.  Two Coors Light Talls and a Mai Tai and $65 later.  Still bummed about the Que for 2 but you do have to ask for it.  I would have saved $15 and not have to bring home an added leftover dinner for 2.

1054825,2015-02-21,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"Three of us went to this restaurant based upon their advertised web page. I was craving Barbecued Beef Ribs. With the whole Texas theme going for this place, I imagined I was going to get a decent quality plate of beef ribs. I was wrong! The entire menu had only 2 beef dinners: a hamburger or a beef brisket!! WHAT???
But if you are interested in eating dead pigs, then there are all kinds of pig foods that should make you squeal with delight. But not for me. 
We waited 37 minutes to be served on the night of Feb. 14th, at 7 PM. I reluctantly ordered a Salmon entree' which I already knew was going to be frozen. In fact, when it arrived on my table, I began to eat it and the flavor was 1/2 of that of normal fresh salmon. The filet slice was only about 3/4's of an inch thick. The whole center of the fish was still raw. Now let me explain, I love sushi - and raw, fresh salmon included. But when the fish is first frozen, then flash grilled on a hot grill, there is no way that the frozen center is going to be cooked properly. And the raw center had the texture of mushy, rotten fish that's over-ripe by about 5 days too long in a refrigerator. Completely inedible. No problem with the waitress...she sent the manager over to my table. The manager was professional, nice and apologetic. She comped the $13.99 cost of the salmon dinner, so I went home still hungry, with only a small tossed salad and about 6 French fries in my belly. Oh yes...and a Glen Levitt double shot of scotch on the rocks that I downed during the long wait for dinner. My two guests were fine with whatever they ate, but then they don't get out to dine very often and they are teenagers. 
What has happened to the landscape of Barbecue Beef in America? Have we become a nation of pig cannibals?  John Wayne and Stuart Anderson (of Black Angus steakhouse fame) are rolling over in their graves!!  America's  food palettes have been destroyed with new generations of pig lovers.

Being part of a chain, nothing really stands out here, which can be a good thing. (People will either love or hate standouts, so better business to aim for the middle of the road.)

I had me 2 toddlers with me so by that time they were getting pretty ancy.

I understand that it was close to closing but it took them 45 minutes before I got an item they advertise on the happy hour menu.  Finally after finishing the nachos and waiting for drink refills,  I decide enough is enough,  put $10 (enough to cover the nachos and drinks) on the table,  gather my children and walk out,  the lady asked my friend what was wrong and she briefly explained,  the waiter replied with ""I'm sorry we just ran out of a lot of things"" if that was the case, I don't understand why they couldn't have communicated that.

1162060,2010-09-16,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"This is my preferred location for this restaurant for a couple of reasons.

Both times I've been here, the waiters have been super-friendly.  The first time I went, the waiter cheerfully and patiently took the time to explain to my party the six sauces at every table: Sweet & Zesty (my favorite), Texas Pit (tangy & peppery), Devil's Spit (hot), Rich & Sassy (original), Georgia Mustard (vinegary), and last but not least, ketchup. 

I've always ordered the onion strings as an appetizer, which are served with a rÃ©moulade dipping sauce.  These onion strings are surprisingly flavorful, and not too greasy (they are ""flash fried"").  Which brings me to the other reason that I prefer this location.  When I ordered the onion strings at the W. Flamingo location, the onion strings were noticeably greasier.

For the entree, I've always ordered one of Dave's Sassy BBQ Salads -- either with pulled BBQ chicken or Georgia chopped pork.  Both are scrumptious.  

Last time I was here, my friend and I split this salad.  The waiter brought it to us in two bowls and we each got a deliciously sweet cornbread muffin.  And the half-portion was more than enough to fill me.  

The other thing I love about this place is Famous Dave's Margarita. I don't often drink hard liquor, but I enjoy a margarita now and then and Famous Dave's serves a good one.  Served in a large salt-rimmed glass, the brandy floater gives the center of the drink an amber color and a nice kick.  (This is another thing that the W. Flamingo location didn't do right.  They stirred the brandy floater into the margarita, so you couldn't even tell that it was in there.)

So if you're looking for a good BBQ place with reasonable prices and excellent service, I recommend Famous Dave's.  Especially this location.

UPDATE:  I tried a new appetizer when I was here last -- the smoked salmon spread with fire-grill flat bread.  It was very tasty and I would recommend it over the onion strings.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,2,1,4,wDyHHdm3hoT81jqHE773qg

Decent food decent portions and an interesting way of serving food on a trashcan lid. The family eats here not as much as we used to but we always enjoy it. Try all 5 sauces before you decide which is more your style. That being said it is a good thing there are rolls of paper towels at your table. There is beef, pork and chicken but I don't remember any steak on the menu. You get corn on the cob, fries and a corn muffin and a side with your meal. I always get the jalapeno mac and cheese and then I am full. Forget dessert because it is limited and lame but who goes there for the dessert anyways so no harm done. Try it for yourself.

All the lights went out we were told by the server that the lights will stay off because they were closing the manager told us that another customer had in screwed a light bulb and tripped the circuit . I made a joke we need a discount for having to sit in the dark she was fast to put me in my place in front of my entire family really embarrassing. The server would interrupt our conversations without an excuse me or sorry . We sat in the dark for most of our experience . The manager made this power outage even worst with her attitude.

It's the Applebee's of barbecue. I wouldn't go into a 7/11 and be angry that it wasn't as nice as the convenience store in the Four Seasons. 

Anyways:

Service: my server Lindsey was the bomb. Checked up on us just enough, was super nice and dealt with all my weird questions. And it was Valentine's Day! Shout out to you for being cheery even though you were working on a holiday. You go girl. Thoroughly pleased by her and if this was based on her alone I would give it five stars. 

Food: it's good, but just like I said before it's the Applebee's of BBQ. My green beans were super over cooked and I hated that the food was served on wheat bread and not Texas toast. I loved the Georgia chopped pork my valentine got! I had Texas brisket and it was to par. Everything was super tender and my Mac and cheese was definitely the type I know and love from growing up in the south. The real winner at this place is the cornbread. Get extra. Food score was like 3/5. Okay but I see potential to improve for sure! 

Small things: the bathrooms could be cleaner but it was a busy day, there was just paper towels on the floor. I also feel like some smaller touches - like putting the alcohol warning in the women's restroom in a frame and not a binder sleeve and stuff would make this place a little nicer. Still 4/5 for nit picky stuff like that! 

Thank you so much Lindsey!",81TwDLaT--phE6d4ir67UQ,0,1,4,Tfau8SlO27yM1VhxXssT_g

Walked in, and it was kind of busy. Smelled AWESOME inside. Once we sat down and i saw a roll of paper towels on a pipe thing, i was all about it!

The dropped off a plate of chips and some sauces to taste while we waited for the food. All of the sauces were good. I don't know if they make them there or what, but I didn't recognize the taste in any of them to generic or branded items.

Once the food came, i honestly was in heaven. I ordered the rib dinner, salad on the side. standard stuff. Really did surprise me. The meat was juicy and tender. nothing was dry. the salad was cold and had a great flavor.

Only thing i saw that was eh was the amount of fries they give with their dinners. Seemed kind of...i don't know, dumb i guess you could say to only give a small amount of french fries when you offer this much food with everything else. I mean, everything is big portions there, and the amount of fries was just silly considering the cost to profits going on.

The groupon did come in handy, saved us a few bucks. However, it was not necessary when i went back multiple times! But i guess you can say Groupon did get you guys a new customer :)

So I enjoy Famous Dave's (and when my boyfriend told me I hadn't taken him there, I didn't believe him - LOL!). I like the westy bar feel, I like how the wait staff all seem like they hang out afterhours, I like the brisket, and I super enjoy the 6 flavors of bbq sauce I can continuously rotate because even though Devil's Spit is my numero uno, I forget what the other flavors taste like!

My local FD is 60 miles south, in Gilroy. Because of this, I cheat on them with Texas Roadhouse (Union City). At FD's my daughter and I usually get the All-American. It's a serving platter with chicken, brisket, ribs, corn on the cob, one piece of white bread, and sides. Love the options because a girl can never have too many! Their bar assortment is not too bad, either. But then again, I can't really recall much drinking I do at Famous Daves. Oh wait, I've tried their Famous Margarita...which wasn't very ""famous"" at all (Gilroy) and some spike strawberry lemonade which was a little too syrupy (Las Vegas) for what I think a spiked strawberry lemonade should taste like (bestest is Lucille's in Henderson, NV!).

I'll be back. I know it.

Last time i went to the neaby buckinghams? First time sitting in at a Famous Daves, ive have their ribs before, and their pork sandwiches were catered at a work event. So i wasnt expecting much and came on a whim *in the neighborhood*

SO GLAD I DID, for us there was no wait time, hostess was blah was waiter was nice introducing us to daves, gave a silly sauce demo lol

Almost THE best bbq meal ever. GF and I ordered the new 'que for two' platter. I wasnt that hungry but i wish i was as we just fell short of cleaning the table. Ribs, chicken, chopped pork, fries, cornbread.

Lets start backwards
Cornbread- I only like sweet corn bread so this was a WOW and best ever
Fries- Good for a restaurant, nothing special to mention
Chopped pork- Very delicious, i liked that it wasnt drowning in sauce so i could apply my own, toast on the bottom was top notch
Chicken- BEST ive had in my life, perfectly cooked 0 complaints
RIbs- ok... i know there are a lot of factors here but, overall 3.5?/5 just on the ribs. Not bad, not the best but surely better than most others and enough to warrant a return visit. Some were great, some ok, so its a weird mix vote O_o on the plus side though

I first wanted to go to  Lucille's because they are great as well, over in Henderson, but this place is closer and maybe a little cheaper, but not entirely sure about that. When we first got there we had to wait about ten minutes before we got seated. This was strange to me because I saw a whole room of booths not being used, and booths are my favorite place to sit. It was also strange that after the ten minutes of waiting, nobody had left, so it must have taken them a long time to clean us up a spot or something. When we did get seated they sat  us back in a crowded room. The place was packed with the rest of the restaurant open. I was confused by that tactic. The room was also very cold. It felt nice at first, since Vegas is so hot, but it was a little overwhelming after a while. My final complaint was the ice tea was sub par. It wasn't horrible, it's just Lucille's was quite a bit better.

On the positive side, the service was great as usual. The food was very tasty. I shared the feast for two that had ribs, brisket, and roasted chicken. Everything was really good. There sauces at the table were fun to try and add to our meal. All five of them are unique and special in their own way. Our waiter helped us pick wise decisions for the meat and side options (he recommended the roast chicken over bbq because we already had all kinds of bbq, plus there was sauces on the table). A huge plus which makes me almost want to put a five down is that we were all receiving our refills before our original was empty, except for my son Joben, he had to ask. Our sides of coleslaw and macaroni and cheese were terrific. Macaroni had a nice spicy flavor. I can't wait to go back again and give it a five if they fix the seating situation, and I will order a lemonade or something and skip the ice tea.",7wEPYaWpPlxII-RQf3nTaw,0,0,4,taHXmsZi5mqnXJRH9j5NNw

The bbq is fabulous. Always tender and cooked to perfection. Sometimes though they can be a little cheap with the amount of bbq sauce they apply, but then again I assume thats why they have 4 different bbq sauces at the end of your table. take your finger and try them all. In my opinion only two are worth putting on the meat. 

Not a fan of their mac n cheese. can we say gross. who puts crunchy peppers and corn in it. And wheres the cheese? I thought it was mac n cheese. It just doesnt have that southern taste to it. I was expecting something different i guess. Instead I got something that crunchy in my mouth and made me want to spit in it in my napkin. oh wait, i did! On the other hand the fries are so good. I wish they'd give you more. They are like potato wedges but instead of them being uncooked in the middle and perfect on the outside like other bbq places these are perfectooo. Lastly the meat is good, not a fan of the sausage. It just is weird tasting to me. I like the ribs and the brisket though. Mmm. The corn bread i a must too. Just wih it'd stay together before i cram it in my mouth. I hate having crumbs on my lap. 

The service is friendly, but jeesh the food tastes forever to get to the table. I was wishing I would have come not hungry so that by the time the food came i was hungry and not starving. I swear, I was ready to naw on my hubbys arm. It was bad enough that the wait for 40 minutes just to get seated. Now i have to wait another 30 for food. Def not my cup of tea. 

I prefer this place over others such as buzz bbq, but then again come here yourself and try it (just make sure its a weekday and always before dinner time. beat the rush!)",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,0,1,4,7Eqb2Gemt7Vqh6m0WunBiw

I mean, I'd had it when visiting but it wasn't available where I had lived, so my anticipation was really high for some awesome BBQ. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated quickly, which is why is got 1 star. The second star was because my uncle loved his food so much. 
My food on the other hand, was nasty. The oil where the fries are deep fried in is obviously old, all I could taste was oil, and the fries were dark. For the main dish, I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich. The chicken was kind of grayish/brown looking? I didn't take any chances and I picked the white meat out and ate that. The bread was stale, as if it was sitting in an open bag for way too long. Hardly any sauce on the sandwich, which I suppose is alright since there was some on the table. 
But, the worst thing is that I ordered a Diet Coke and she brought me a regular, when I told her it was a regular she got defensive and said she knew it was Diet. I asked for a new drink anyways, and when she came back she had some excuse about how the syrup lines were crossed and they're going to fix it (I NEVER GOT IT)!! How annoying. THEN, she took my plate before I was done (and while my uncle was still eating). How rude is that? I was expecting the manager to come over and apologize, hopefully give a slight discount or something, but no such luck.

One thing I feel that was lacking at this place was service.  We are not regulars at this location and now after this experience I am sure I will never be back.

Whenever I go here, I always try to enjoy it to the fullest, so it can get kind of expensive. For two entrees, sodas, and a big appetizer, the total cost was around $70. That isn't cheap, by far, but there is always plenty to take home with you.

We had to come back to the location afterward to pick up an item we had left and my boyfriend asked to speak with a manager to let him know he had gotten sick - the manager told him there was no way it was the food there and immediately gave him the brush off.

3044363,2014-08-30,1,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"I was working in the area and in the mood for BBQ.

I ordered the lunch two meat basket, two meats and one side and a corn muffin. With a drink, $13.06 including tax.

For the meats I had chopped pork and sliced brisket. For the side I had red mashed potatoes.

I'll start with the meats, a little background is needed. I have three smokers at home a vertical, a side box and a gas vertical. That being said, I'm no stranger to bbq, so my bar may be a little higher, than the average bbq eater.

Both of the meats were good. The brisket cooked to near perfection and moist, tender but not falling apart. Good bbq is kept moist while cooking, it doesn't need sauce, after cooking, for moisture. The sauce, after cooking, is something you add to personal taste, if at all. These meats stood on there own, great taste, without need for sauces.

Now the side, one of the things I like about bbq places is trying the different sides each place offers. The red mashed potatoes were terrible. I didn't like the taste, but the main problem was texture, very grainy like poor quality instant mashed potatoes.

They had a variety sauces, normal, hot, sweet  and mustard. I tasted them, any of which would overpower the taste of the meats I was eating. If you go to the trouble of slow cooking and smoking a meat, then put a sauce on it where you can't taste the meat, what's the point. You could have just sliced up hot dogs and put sauce on them, if all you're going to taste is sauce. 

Summary:
The meats were very good. The side I had was not. If I had ordered a different side, it could easily have been a 4 star review.

I would recommend to anyone, with the caveat, don't order the red mashed potatoes.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,0,3,S1L-U4oX61oGwYtIVEMpTg

I am not a huge fan of chains but this place serves good BBQ and it's always consistent.  What I love about the place is the BBQ platters for 2 or 4.  It's an upside down garbage can lid with chicken, ribs, pork...  I think you get to pick 3 or 4 meats, plus a couple sides and some cornbread.  Its like 25 bucks for 2 and it's plenty of food and I am a big eater.  Compared to other places it's a deal.
 

Now it's not the greatest championship bbq but it is still pretty tasty,  the meat is always tender, has a good mild smoke, and is very flavorful.  Also some places do some meats good and others not so much, all there selections are good by me.  They have like 5 sauces that are all good and the sides are solid.  I really like luciles bbq too but the combo I order for myself is 26 bucks so this place is half the price and comparable and consistent, I have had some charred up racks of ribs at luciles. 

Break down of vegas BBQ, my opinion of course

Luciles - Delicious, probably the most delicious in vegas, but pricey.  Great atmosphere, great sauce, great meat, and great sides. They serve you biscuits before that are awesome.  Have had some meals there better than others.    

TC's - OK overall, light smoke, ribs not the most tender, sides nothing special, pulled pork is good, raised the prices but still not bad

RUB - Ate it once, expensive and not memorable.  Wasn't terrible though

K's - Worst I have had in vegas, the only thing more tasteless than the meat is the sauce. 

Cooks - In the ghetto, sweet sauce, decent BBQ, bring a gun

CJs - I guess its texas BBQ, counter serviceand pricey for what you get.  Plain BBQ with thin sauce, didn't get it. 

Memphis - Good ribs, mushy pulled pork, pricey I think, good flavor.     

Adams - Had a pork sandwich, was dry and the sauce didn't help much.  That's all I remember.

What a great surprise we received!  First I need to give a big THANK YOU to the staff and our server, Shawn (sp?).  Shawn was so cordial and happy to assist us by explaining what they had and bringing us home made chips to try all the sauces with before our plates arrived.  What an awesome idea!  You can actually taste all the sauces using the chips instead of the tips of your fingers or fork!

My husband and I both ordered the six rib plate.  His with fries and cole slaw, and mine with fries and baked beans.  These were possibly the best ribs we have ever eaten, and believe me, just moving here from Texas we have eaten plenty of ribs!  Never have I had so much tender meat on each rib - and with the sauce that I chose I was in heaven!  Needed 3 wipes just to clean my fingers when we were done.  But the best part of all?  With the ribs being so meaty we each took home 3 ribs apiece and got to do it all over again the next day!

The fries are the best fries we have ever had, and my husband liked the cole slaw.  My beans were extremely good and I could have eaten more!  Being an expert in the bread pudding department, my husband said it was just OK, not the best he has ever had.  He said my home cooked bread pudding beat theirs.  Thank you, honey!

All-in-all Famous Dave's was a direct hit with us and we will definitely be back.  For those of you that have a bad experience, please give them another try - they are worth another visit!",Wkov9p6qK-ZN_zU0XJoFOg,1,0,5,wEVvLJdzJJdBtCKbEzjpfA

Everything had the prefect amount of sauce not over powering. The chicken was tender, the spareribs where tender and the chopped pork was juicy. The cornbread was not dry at all.

My mom, brother, and SIL went today for lunch. We waited several minutes after being seated before we even had a server come to our table. He stopped by and said he'd be back, but we'd waited so long we were already ready to order and asked him if he could just take our order and not leave, which he did. Our appetizer of onion strings came out without the extra sauce, which is fine. Our food came except for one plate, and after waiting a few minutes our server came back to check and we had to point out that her food hadn't come.
The food overall was fine-we ordered a variety of plates including ribs, hot links, brisket, bbq chicken, and salmon. I don't think our server came back until we were all pretty much done, and we ordered dessert and asked for boxes. When he brought our dessert he apologized for the poor service and said it wasn't usually like him, which is fine. My Mom interjected to point out that on multiple recent visits we've had bad service, which is true. The restaurant wasn't overly business, so there wasn't really a reason for the lack of visits to our table. We heard the table behind us discussing their issues with one of the managers as well, so it wasn't just us.

If you are looking for some succulent beef brisket or mouth watering pulled pork sandwiches then you have come to the right place. Their various sauce selections ensure that you will never have to deal with a dry piece of meat. Their portions are heaping even though they are a bit overpriced.

The overall vibe of the restaurant is fun and family friendly at the same time and it's a good place to take a girl on a date.

The Big Slab comes with a full rack of ribs, a corn bread muffin, corn-on-the-cob, and two sides (we go mac-n-cheese and famous fries). We also shared Chili-Roasted Corn Fritters which came with clover honey. The fritters were fried balls of deliciousness and almost tasted like dessert with the honey. It was a nice sweet and savory combination. The ribs were definitely the highlight of the meal. The ribs were very meaty and tender, and were not drenched in BBQ sauce. I wasn't too crazy about the side dishes unfortunately. 

Our waiter saw us sampling each of the BBQ sauces before our meal and so he brought us freshly made BBQ chips to help us try the sauces. I must say the chips were some of the best BBQ chips I've ever had. As for the sauces, here's my breakdown: 

- Georgia Mustard = tastes like Italian dressing
- Sweet & Zesty = tastes like typical sweet and tangy American BBQ sauce
- Rich and Sassy= a much milder version of Sweet & Zesty
- Texas Pit = tastes like beef jerky seasoning
- Devils Spit = tastes like Texas Pit but with a spicy kick that lingers in your mouth

I actually combined Sweet & Zesty with Devil's Spit to make a sweet but spicy sauce for my ribs. If you're not into sauces, the ribs are good by themselves. 

Service is a bit slow here but friendly. I will definitely be paying a visit to my local Famous Dave's in San Jose but I'm glad I made a stop at this location.",NBNIUJj60tVBKvWHhy3egg,3,0,4,62i2pmXtUY4jpIfFkfAGmg

It's located on Rainbow Boulevard past the shopping plaza at the corner of Rainbow and Lake Mead which has a large Best Buy as it's anchor tenant.

Pricing used to be more attractive with a regular stream of email coupons for 20% off, ""Cue for 2 for$22.00"" and the like. However,  since the end of 2017 the offers all have mysteriously dried up. The company must have implemented a radical change in it's marketing strategy effective 2018.

They also used to have a Famous Lunch Card: buy 5 lunches and get the sixth lunch free.

The restaurant has dine in options as well as a unique separate entrance with dedicated parking for all carry out orders. Thus, you need not go into the main restaurant itself if you're a to-go customer. 

Specialties worth ingesting include the brisket, pulled pork, ribs and pretty much any of the combo platters. Delectable side dishes - any two of which come with a meal - include the Wilbur beans, garlic mashed potatoes, coleslaw and more.

Monday's was Military Monday, 20% off for active and retired military.  Thank you!

Tuesday was Big Slab Tuesday's, $20 for a HUGE rack of spareribs platter and a couple sides.

Wednesday was brisket platter Wednesday's, only $10, also includes two sides.

And the everyday happy hour from the ridiculous times of 2PM-6PM, and 9PM-Close!
Domestic draft was only 2 bucks, premium draft was 3 bucks, HUGE nacho plate for 5 bucks, wings and fries was 5 bucks, and a basket of rib tips was only 6 buckaroo's!

Just looking at the chicken I could tell it was dry and one of my Famous Dave favorites, Brisket, it was DRY! I spent $55 and a drive to pick at least decent meal for the family and this location struck out again. I have had good fresh food here before, but this tasted like it sat over night warmed up this morning, on consistency here. Might be my last time rolling the dice here.

We ended up ordering the Rib Tips with french fries, and the Texas Brisket with macaroni and cheese & barbecue pork and beans as our sides.. of course with an extra order of corn bread so that we'd both have one.

My daughter and I both had the St Louis Rib-N-Meat BBQ Combo. Kathy had the Rib Tips as her second meat, and I chose Hot Link Sausage as my second. Despite the fact that Famous Dave's is a chain, the Combos were surprisingly good and generously heaped with a decent amount of food for the price. This was my first experience with Famous Dave's and my daughter's second visit to this location. You get to choose two sides with every Combo... I chose Potatoes and Potatoes (Famous Fries and Potato Salad) and Kathy chose Famous Fries and Firecracker Green Beans. 

The Combos came out on square platters with the food placed on checkerboard patterned paper. Meat was not immersed in their Rich & Sassy Barbecue Sauce, which the restaurant uses on their Ribs. You can still taste the Sausage and/or Ribs and not the Sauce, which is typical of most BBQ places. My daughter and I both had compliments about the Fries and the Corn Bread Muffins which were moist and tender.

We both had to drink the Southern Sweetened Ice Tea - nothing special.

The only detraction? The slight over-saltiness of the meat. And the interior can get a little tiring... their use of steel galvanized pipe on their door handles to the use of it as paper roll dispensers at each table... Someone actually had to use their creative energy to design this???

In summary, better than Casino food any day of the week. And better than some independent BBQ establishments!

Cooked from frozen and a spicy cajun breading that tried to cover up the taste of low quality catfish. The chicken tenders were very dry and overcooked. The sweet corn on the cob was cold and soggy. Im sure it has been precooked and sitting aside in a big batch or something. The sauces at the table are a good variety and it's convenient that they are there.

4744365,2010-06-19,1,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"For me, Famous Dave's has been like riding a bicycle when you're a kid.  (Bear with me.)  When you say you're going to ride a bike, you know exactly what you're getting into, and you won't be disappointed.  But as a kid, more distractions come along, such as TV.  And then after all the begging with your parents, you eventually get an Xbox or Playstation.  And pretty soon you know the bike is sitting there in your garage, gathering dust.  Not because it ever failed you or did you wrong, but because you found other things to spend your free time doing.  But whenever you hop onto that bike, you remember all the good times you had, yet know that you won't be riding it every day like you used to.

Yeah, in that story, Famous Dave's is a bicycle while Memphis BBQ and Lucille's are either the TV or Xbox/Playstation.  It took me years to finally make my way down to Memphis/Lucille's, and since then my visits to Famous Dave's have been rare.  I made it to Dave's last Sunday for my dad's birthday; he's been a loyal customer ever since his first bite of ribs.  I've always enjoyed their brisket and BBQ sandwiches.  The meat has always been tender, and their sauces tasty, but most of all their food is consistent.  The same can be said about their service.

We got there around peak time - 7-7:30 ish. WE were living @ the orleans and were dying to eat anything NOT served @ the Orleans. ITs good but eating every meal every day @ the same places can get old. 

MAIN ENTREE: We ordered the All american Feast for 2. We actually had ordered this before when living in Vista, CA (San Diego (North) county) and we knew how filling it can be so we dismissed the side dishes and took those home since the orleans doesnt have refrigerators. boo.  We focused on the meats.. . you know the good stuff. 
We had ribs brisket and chicken. the ribs were ok. really good on one side. and horrible on the other. as you progressed to the smaller side the tougher and more jerky like they became to the point you couldnt even get meat off the bone even if the K9 unit was going to work @ it. Just plain disappointing. the chkn was good but come on, i can make that at home. or hell I can buy it at costco for $4.99 and eat that for days. Not worth the $ IMHO. the brisket was just ok. . kinda bland and not that great of flavor. I wonder if they even use a rub? or any kind of marination?
I'm from TX where we focus on the flavor of the meat and not too concerned w/ sauce b/c the sauce covers the flavor of the meat most of the time. 
MOST of the time. . once in awhile you find a great sauce that gives you an alternate spin on the great flavor. . eh. . not here. it justmasks it w/ its 6 different kinds of bbq sauces. 

i enjoy the TX kind and the rich and sassy but again, you cant buy me w/ sauce. prove yourself w/ the flavor and quality of your BBQ. 

SIDES: GREAT CORNMEAL MUFFIN. WHEW! that's dessert right there. glad I packed it to go. the beans are great..who cant make great beans? the fries are just filler to make that trash can lid look fuller. nxt time you go. .opt for a sandwhich or something. . you can get even more brisket by ordering the man hanlder than you can by ordering the q for 2. . so focus one one  thing and I think they give you better quality than the combos.",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,1,0,3,Wr9VrlxO0hp0_yDadPzmQw

It wasn't busy for this Easter Sunday, surprisingly.  It took about ten to fifteen minutes for our table to be ready for our party of nine.  

Tonya, our waitress started us off with drinks.  The majority of our party started with Southern Sweet Tea.  It was yummy, but not quite as good as the stuff I had in Georgia or at Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ.

I was torn between the Sweetwater Catfish Fingers and the Texas Beef Brisket, so I ended up with both, the Two-Meat Combo! It automatically comes with corn-on-the cob, corn bread muffin, and a choice of two sides.  Although the breaded catfish was a bit tasty, I was a bit disappointed in the size of the fingers.  Indeed, they are definitely 'fingers' and are small strips of fish.  They come with two sauces - a Sweet Soul Jalapeno and remoulade.  I found the remoulade to be more enjoyable than the other sauce.    The brisket was less than what I expected and a bit dry.  I wouldn't order it again.  My two sides were Drunkin' Apples and Garlic Red-Skin Mashed Potatoes.  The apples were nothing special with cinnamon sprinkled on it, but the mashed potatoes were good.

The BF opted for the Rib-N-Meat Combo, which included bone spareribs and a choice of a hot link, wings, catfish, or any of the other meats offered.  He went for the hot link.  He got a hearty portion of spareribs and they were definitely a lot tastier than my dish.  The hot link was okay though.

They have about seven different sauces to choose from at your table - Devil's Spit, Georgia Mustard,  Hot & Sassy, Smokey Chipotle, Rich & Sassy,  Sweet & Zesty, and Texas Pit.

They don't offer that many sides to choose from - Potato Salad, Creamy Coleslaw,  Wilbur Beans, Famous Fries, and Firecracker Green Beans (w/bacon) are the only other choices.

If you do end up with leftovers, be sure to ask for a few containers to take home the sauces with.  They have a few sauces packaged to go, otherwise you can squeeze some into those plastic containers.

Service was good.  Tonya was pretty good with bringing lots of refills of our Sweet Tea because she knew we were thirsty things.  It saved us the trouble of having to ask her for more and she was one step ahead of the game.

Overall, Famous Dave's was just okay in my book.  My brisket and catfish were disappointing, but the spareribs were more enjoyable.  They do have my Sweet Tea, but it wasn't sweet enough.  My order was less than stellar, it was alright.  It's a chain restaurant located in almost every state except 11 of them!  They must be doing alright then!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,3,3,sqw6gro8xTikzh5ZWsOnOw

5049714,2013-03-15,5,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"I'll tell you a funny story. 

So I visited my mom and she was SOO excited to tell me her suburbia city has a new awesome BBQ place and she was excited to try to impress her little gastronome. She was trying to take me to Famous Daves....and didn't know we had them all over Vegas...or that they were all over America. I thought it was so cute how earnest she was, but it did strike me that yeah, for a chain it's pretty tasty as I sat there gnawing with her. 

Famous Daves sometimes suffer from their chain reputation and depending on the location growing pains. No, it ain't competition que, but that's not why I go here and that's not how I'm going to think and set myself up for something it's not.

Surprisingly enough, their BBQ chicken I'm a big fan of. It's always juicy and good flavor which is not often the case with many a BBQ chicken. I am rarely, if ever, going to order chicken at a 'que joint but here I will. There's a mustard relish they have that is good on it or on top of sausage which is the second thing I like from here. I am a sauce person so a bunch of flavors of sauce, I can get down with.

I think their corn muffins are a guilty pleasure for me and I admittedly look forward to that most. And normally I'm not a fan of baked beans, but something about theirs is good to me. Maybe it has a lot of meat bits in it, but I just find the flavor just right for my taste that it ends up being something I order everytime. 

To me, for some place to get me to order two things I normally don't, they have to be doing something right, right?

Also service has never been bad at a Famous Daves. On this visit, definitely pleasant as I expect, checked on us. Even though she was prepping to close and was cleaning up towards the half leg of us eating, we were never made to feel rushed or unwelcome. 

I rarely go, just because there are so many places to eat at, but once in a while it sounds like it'll totally hit the spot. I think as we like to be a ""foodie community"" we're quick to go no to chains, or pretend we don't go to them. I'll happily admit sometimes I just want some damn chicken, wilbur beans and corn muffins.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,5,4,vpIdgqyZ2gfR_0rqwYcowg

Called upon arrival, and waited less than a minute when the waitress appeared with my order. I gave her a tip, of course, as I'm sure they do not get a request like mine often. Second: The food was plentiful - too much for me for one sitting, so I saved half for the next day and it was as delicious as it was the day before. Third: I ordered a half rack of spareribs, a side of baked beans and a salad. The spareribs were thick, meaty and tender, and the sauce was flavorful and just right. The baked beans were very tasty and the salad was fresh and crisp. The cornbread muffin was great. Finally, for my next visit, I plan to go inside and have an actual sit-down restaurant experience.

The only problem is the food.
It tastes okay, but it's not very good barbeque.
It not authentic.
The barbeque sauce tastes like it comes out of a bottle.
I mean, to cook authentic barbeque, you should really smoke the meat for like 12 hours, so I guess it's unreasonable to expect that from a chain restaurant.

Brisket, omg it was perfect with a nice smoke ring and plenty of meat on the plate. I savored each bite and paired it with the Texas Pit sauce.

I ran into this place on the northwest part of Las Vegas on Rainbow Blvd. As I parked my ""hooptie"", I saw a pig picture on the restaurant's logo. Seeing the pig is exactly like looking myself in the mirror. (Except the mirror didn't crack!)

The pig on the logo and looking at the menu means the restaurant serving only ""Pork"" ribs. 

I was disappointed to read that. So I ordered the St. Louis Rib-n-meat Combo anyway. For $16.99, I get 4 slabs of slow-cooked Pork ribs with another meat choice in which I took the Chicken Tenders. I also get two sides and I took the red skin mashed potatoes and the firecracker green beans. The pork ribs tasted spicy, lean and tender. The chicken tender was nothing to brag about. But the tangy and spicy chipotle dipping sauce adds a nice touch. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and add a mellow garlic taste.

I have no complaints about the service.  It was great.  Susan did an excellent job.  I am gonna start with the sides.  The cornbread was average.  It's called cornbread, not corn muffin.  I want a big ass piece.  Fries were okay.  Nothing special.  The BBQ chips also were just average.  Oh, but the mac and cheese.  Absolutely horrible.  Why corn?  And why Jalapenos?  The texture and consistency was horrid.  Absolutely the worst mac and cheese I have ever had.  I hate the Kraft crap with that powdered cheese product, but I would of rather had that instead.

Let's talk meat.  We both ordered the St Louis ribs.  My girlfriend also ordered hers with burnt ends.  I stole one of her burnt ends and it was actually pretty good.  I would of loved to have a big bowl of them on a Sunday afternoon watching football.  It was nice to see a place actually serve spare ribs.  I think all the main chains have ruined baby back ribs.  That fall off the bone, loaded in sauce crap.  The ribs were actually cooked perfectly.  Even though I would have preferred a little bit more of a kick in the rub, the rub was good.  The sauce was a perfect amount.  The ribs were finished in the sauce rather than slathered on afterwards.  The only downside about the ribs is for some unknown reason, they didn't remove the membrane.  That is a rookie mistake.  I don't know if that is their standard or something got overlooked in prep.

But without so many flowery words, over the years, this place has been more of a BBQ ""fix"" spot rather than a must-have culinary experience. 

My most recent visit, I ordered 1/3 rack of St. Louis ribs, which came with two sides (corn and Mac and cheese for me) and corn bread. I really appreciated the variety in their menu and the amount of combinations you can mix and match between ribs/brisket/BBQ chicken and even all the sides. 

I thought the ribs were good, and tender, but thought they could be juicier? By technicality, the meat did fall off the bone, but it felt like the moisture was more coming from the sauce. My mother ordered her ribs with no sauce, so she could add her own from the selection of sauces at the table, and hers looked a bit dry to me. Next time, I might try this as well because the original sauce that came with mine became a little overpowering after a while. The sides were reasonable. The Mac and cheese had a bit of a kick of spice, which I appreciated, and the corn on the cob didn't seem super fresh but I liked how you got two halves! Yum! Lastly, I, personally, love corn bread in all shapes and forms, and the muffin that came with this meal was perfection--slightly toasted on the muffin top and super soft and moist for the rest of it. 

All in all, this place doesn't amaze me, but it does it's job. BBQ spot with hearty servings at a reasonable price. My $13.99 plate left me stuffed and had leftovers for later. I've never run into issues with service, and at our last visit, our waitress was really great and attentive. Enjoy, and dig in :-)",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,1,1,3,y0D0dNvk_HnhbE4AkuK_uw

5442811,2015-09-09,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"Good ""Chain BBQ"". Much better than Memphis BBQ, but still not a place with the pit in the back.  The food is always consistent and good.  The servers always seem to be having a good time.  We prefer to eat in the bar area as there are no children and tents to be a bit quieter so it is easier to talk.",hAZEee0Q7APAcerRQ4Ze3g,0,0,3,Ir4KuvV0K7p3NwAHzvYDDw
5445431,2014-12-27,1,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"Ah, Famous Dave's. I ask, what is it Dave's is famous for?
Is it the architecture? Can't be, the outside of the place looks like Pizza Hut meets Red Lobster (circa 1978).
Is it the decor? Not unless you get awards for a Bass Pro Shops Cracker Barrel (or TGI Fridays) mash up.
Was it the hostess? Maybe, we were greeted promptly and immediately offered a booth in the bar. When I declined and said we preferred a table, we were led to the opposite side of the building and offered a table there; instead of the one I had been standing six inches from when the booth was offered. Sooooo, not the hostessing either.
I know, the menu, Dave's is famous for the menu, looks good, tries to promote the food and is laid out well......wait, that last one is a lie.....Not the menu.
Hmmmmm.......this is allegedly a restaurant, so maybe, just maybe, it's the food Dave's is so rightly famous for! Alas, no.
The food is abysmal and miserable to put it kindly.
My wife and I each ordered the two meat lunch special, which is your choice of two meat like substances and a single side item. Now, for a mere $2.49 you can order an additional side item; which I gamely did as most places have decent side items, especially BBQ joints. Well, was I in for a surprise, unfortunately. I asked for the ribs and brisket with fries and cole-slaw. What red-blooded American wouldn't love that?
Unfortunately, that would be this one. What I got was teriyaki beef jerky disguised as brisket and TWO, count them, TWO measly ribs. The brisket was probably cooked correctly at some point in it's life, but by the time it was presented to me, it was no longer identifiable. But, I was hungry, and my jaws needed the circuit training, so I chewed, come to think of it, it's two hours later and I am still chewing on at least one piece. The ribs were greasy, in the name of all that is holy in smoking, how in the hell do you make ribs greasy? Famous Dave's staff wear shirts with cute little slogans, like ""Good BBQ is all smoke and beers"", I have news, they think enough beers are going to cover up the lack of good smoke. While I am talking about my lunch, let me also touch on the slaw, don't; just don't. The ""fries"" were edible, if unseasoned in any way. I tried all of the sauces, hoping something would improve this Rocky Horror BBQ show on my plate, but I can't stress how bad they were. I seriously think they bought the cheapest BBQ like stuff they could find at food4less or some other high quality dings and dents grocers and put just enough habanero sauce in it to call something else. I have received better BBQ sauces from Del Taco for chicken fingers. Then when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I looked to see what chicanery they had pulled on my blushing bride celebrating the glories of her own birth. She had gamely ordered the chicken, brisket, slaw, and mashed potatoes. Her description of the chicken to me was, ""Not bad, it's edible"" Wow, that is a screaming endorsement, someone call the papers! (Please note the sarcasm filter). She also received the beef jerky. When our waitress ( think Olive Oyl with the voice of Minnie Mouse) asked my blushing bride how our food was, my demur wife said to Minnie,""the brisket is tough and dry."" To which Minnie emoted dismayed shock and offered my wife some Au Jus (pronounced Awe Juice) to remedy the situation. My wife agreed, while I sat there scratching my head trying to figure out what the hell just happened.
About 8 minutes later, the Awe Juice arrived, it was warmer than the meat at this point, and my wife tried to soften the leather on her plate to no avail. She wound up giving it to the dog (me) to eat. When Minnie finally came back, she said she was sorry my wife didn't like trying to eat leather and offered her something else. (The only reason I know she apologized was because I had CC on for the hearing impaired). My wife declined the offer of more ruined meat byproducts and instead turned her attention to her sides, the slaw and the mashed potatoes. The slaw received a hearty ""meh"" but had the distinction of being edible and almost palatable. All of our hopes now rested on the mashed potatoes, and were about to be dashed. Mash potatoes are not known for being overly flavorful, but no flavor at all? I could have saved over $30.00 and dined on glue stix by Elmer's.
So, if not the architecture, the decor, the welcome, the food, or the service, then just what in the hell is Dave's famous for?",Mzvx_O9SZ3yjDMIGob877Q,0,1,1,-3BvnAx9LRA40RRGmD0-jA

Having that I  often at least 3 times a month supported famous Dave's since his 1st restaurant in Chicago. I ordered rib tips but requested center cut only as I always do because the ends are always a bit tough to chew. The waitress/bar tender took the order and NEVER told me there was an upcharge. Upon receiving my I got the end pieces and the were dry and hard. When I advise the waitress she put her hands up shrugged her shoulders and said ""what do you want me to do""? I told them,and that she was trying not to charge me for my preference. I gave her a look waiting for a follow up and then she says ,"" you want me to replace that one piece for you? It wasn't just that one piece it was 80% of the order. She walked away with an attitude. I called the manager Kevin to advise him of the situation and he advised me that the only problem he had was her comment. Not the fact that I wasn't satisfied and received poor quality food and services. Needless to say my family and I will never spend money there again.",P8tJx1KYFKCoToK7pCcvog,1,0,1,wBoTEJEW4eFRUvgf0j15QA

5516442,2014-01-12,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"I give it three stars because of the pleasant atmosphere and great service. Unfortunately, the famous BBQ was not to our liking. The quality of the food is good- the vegetables were vibrant and fresh, and the burnt ends and wings were good. The first batch of wings were overcooked, but a new batch was brought out that was nice and juicy. Their ""flavor profile"" tends toward spicy- they even spice up the mac & cheese and the cheese sauce for the burnt ends. It was just overdone. The main problem is the sauce varieties just didn't taste good to us, and without good sauce, there's no reason to return. 

We feel bad, because the atmosphere and service experience were great. We joked we'd return for the vegetables and cornbread but we'll probably come back and try the fish sandwich or something not barbecued.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,2,3,3,nF4oBVILEnbeQ7RtgbhzjQ
5657921,2011-06-23,0,N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w,"Wow, this place was awesome. I actually tried some thing new for the first time thanks to sistah. She got the nacho appetizer with beef brisket and boy that shizz was bomb. I wrote another review on this place back in San Jose and it was just as good and similar, so you might want to check it out on what we ordered and how it tasted.

One thing I do want to say about this is the service here is WAAAAAY better than the Famous Dave's I go to in San Jose. If I can rate the place just by its service I'd seriously rate this place 5 stars. Our waitress ""Tina"" was awesome! If I come back here I sure want her to serve our table again. She knew her stuff from the back of her head, she took care of our table like we were guests at her own house. Who does that now a days? If you guys go this this Famous Dave's and get her, you guys are lucky, you'll be in good hands as she makes sure your meal was cooked right and tastes the way you expected it to be. You run out of water? She'll be back within minutes to check up on you to make sure you waters are full. Don't worry guys she doesn't come back every second like some annoying waiters are.

PS: Thanks Tina for making our Famous Dave's experience that much better. Loved your service and keep up the good work.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,1,4,40UYPp96r2kOoAUHBQdjQw

The food was brought out and placed buffet style for the guests which was perfect. Our drinks were refilled without having to ask. My mom had a specific time frame booked for the side room, and we didn't get rushed out when time was up... which was definitely a plus as we packed up the leftovers and cleaned up from the games.

This location is more intimate not as bright and all in the wide open as the Flamingo location. This restaurant has a lot more of that southern country feel with all of the many nic nacs and decorations on the wall.

The staff is great here as well and our server was Danny who I completed a compliment card for because he was Super!

I joined the Pig club which everyone can online and my boyfriend was sent a birthday coupon for a free meal via email, buy one get one good for up to $15.00 hell yeah we used it!

We ordered the two meat, two sides combo platter which is a ton of food! See my photos as the food speaks for itself. When I eat BBQ I always like coleslaw and baked beans they just always seem to hit the spot! I really enjoy the brisket and the boneless wings were good!

I got another coupon in my email, we may just go back and use that as well! It is nice to save money on a grub fest!
