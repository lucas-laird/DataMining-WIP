The restaurant was empty and just some employees staying in a corner and chating in german language. They welcome us and after we exchanged some words about how we heard about the place we placed the order. Chicken snitzel with spaetzel for me and red cabbage with sausages for my fiance. The snitzel was very oily and this is a very good reason for me to don't eat there again. But the real reason was the long hair I found in the spatzel after I completed more than half of portion. This is a big issue for a restaurant. Probably they don't meet the basic standards in the kitchen. I tried to calm myself and don't do a scene in the restaurant in the front of my fiance. We were very embarrassed about this, we were totally shocked because it was the first time when this happened to us. I understand the accidents might happen but if as cook you cover your hair during the work this can prevent all this kind of stuffs. After we paid the bill and tipped I decided to tell to the host what happened. I can't remember any apologies came from that lady. It was the first and last time when we stepped into that place. I will make sure my friends won't ever go there. That's the way it supposed to work.",lxWeollUAQuY0ETIRLoLrQ,1,0,1,-zhyMD48jkXobG3axDtiMQ

The fries were pretty much awful since they were like scraps, no more than an inch long... Is that authentic German fries..? maybe but just tasted like frozen french fries to me. My husband got the something cordon bleu chicken and that was blah. Only flavor to that was from the dry ham baked in. The breading on it tasted fishy. I got the braustburger. Not much to say about that, didnt taste much different from a regular burger. I will say it tastes worse when your burping it up a few hours later.... UGHH! I wouldnt be surprised if you go into their kitchen and their freezer is filled with everything they serve. The waitress was nice very soft spoken. Service was good, but we were the only ones in there at 5 in the afternoon so i suppose it should be... Decent prices but not for that food.

I'd like to come back sometime but I'll probably give it some time before 2nd attempt

I stopped by for a lunch and had a schnitzel entree. It came on a big plate with a meager serving of something resembling mashed potatoes put through the meat grinder. Meat was good although it seemed a little bit on a salty side.

Here are my observations:
It's lunch so I'd like to leave full (or almost) after my meal without chasing it with dessert :) So my advice is put 2 sides instead of one. Does it really cost that much extra for a dollop of sauerkraut? It probably doesn't but customer will leave full and happy (and will come back). 

Based on the average price of lunch in vicinity Cafer Berlin is the most expensive one. So I would suggest to put more effort in marketing (give discount to neighborhood businesses for example).",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,2,0,3,r5H6IGApgCQNqzJaClJPFw

349196,2016-10-20,0,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,"This place is a great find. Definitely added to my list of favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.

I was in Vegas for a trade show with a craving for beer and German food. This was also the night of presidential debate #3 so traffic was a mess. I saw the listing for Cafe Berlin and is scored on all 3 needs... good looking menu, decent selection of beer, and nowhere near UNLV traffic closures.

The first thing you will notice upon arrival is the restaurant is hidden back behind an ARCO station in a rather generic looking strip mall. Don't let that put you off.  I was greeted by the friendly staff and offered a choice of tables. I was meeting another couple and went for a traditional bench style table. When my dinner companions arrived they had brought along another friend from the hotel lobby. As soon as they say down the waitress brought out a fourth place setting and menu without missing a beat and without any of us asking. The night was looking good. 

From there things only got better. We tried the Jaeger schnitzel, bratwurst, Nuernberger Rostbratwuerst'l, the pretzel with mustard and Obatzter, the Sauerbraten and the homemade apple strudel. Every plate went back empty. The big favorites of the evening were the Sauerbraten (some of the best I've ever had, super tender and moist, marinated for 10 days, cooked to perfection) and the apple strudel (tasted freshly made with big chunks of tender apple, raisins and spices with a soft outer shell)

A friend was visiting from out of town so we decided to give it a try. Food was very flavorful and we enjoyed every bite. We ate until we could eat no more.  Only thing we had a issue with was its a bit pricy especially for what it is. Generally schnitzel is supposed to be veal and it's pork. Kinda strange. I understand paying a bit more for veal cause hello it's veal but $20 for breaded pork with gravy and spätzle (pasta type noodle). Don't get me wrong flavors were great just a bit much price wise I think. Between 3 dishes a pretzel and 2 beers for my fiancé, it came to $90+ we will be going again, not as often as we would like because of price, but just be prepared to spend some $.

Around 7:00 pm. When I got into the restaurant, there is a bar on the right hand side which serves German beers and other alcohol for customers. The whole restaurant filled with the smell of delicious foods which makes me feel great appetite. The restaurant decorated in a German style. There are both of German and American flag on the wall. The background color of the restaurant are red, yellow, and black which as same as German flag color. The TV on the wall had pictures of the German food in the menu.

Environment
The floors were very clean and the tables were tidy. The temperature of the restaurant was  decent. In the restroom, the lighting was bright; the floors and counters were aggressively clean. The only downside was I did not see any toilet seat paper cover in the restroom.

We were hoping the Cafe Berlin would meet expectations for decent German food. We were pleasantly surprised because it EXCEEDED our expectations. My husband ordered the Jaegerschnitzel and I ordered the Rahm Schnitzel. Both were delicious! The schnitzels were a crispy, golden brown on the outside while moist and tender inside. The sauces were full of flavor but not too heavy and the spaetzl...mmmmm...nothing but fresh, buttery goodness. We finished our meal with a cherry streudel that was fabulous! it came with whipped cream and a subtle vanilla sauce that was so tasty I used my spoon to slop up what was left!

Very unassuming and quiet looking outside at the front. Walking in we could see a clean looking, open dining area, with a cheerful Hostess / Wait Person who greeted us and took us to a nice table.

The dining room is surprisingly big. It is open, clean, friendly, and has an almost cafeteria style design to it.

German and American beers are available in big glasses so you can Gage the color. The heavy thick head on the cold German beer is inviting and the aroma is very full bodied. 

The menu has a number of German style items to choose from along with a special available. There are Sausages (Wursts)  with very wonderful looking sides of pan fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, sauteed onions, sauerkraut, red cabbage, etc. There is also a sandwich board in the menu that looks like a fine way ""handle"" your lunch. Then the menu describes some very flavorful sounding pork schnitzel platters and a pork or chicken cordon bleu

The menu touts  very nice Vegetarian selections both hot and cold. 

Finally, to insure that no one is left out there is a Kid's menu that allows them to also try these delights.

We opted for the Rollentini Special. Wonderful beef  roll up with spices and a pickle spear in the middle. There was a potato dumpling and red cabbage as sides. The rollentini and the dumpling came with an unbelievable tasty sauce that insured this presentation will be ordered by us again.

We finished our meal by splitting a piece of ""home made"" cherry strudel that was so good be ordered another piece of cherry and a piece of apple to take home.

I heard about Cafe Berlin on the west side near Decatur/215. We recently stopped in for dinner. We were warmly greeted and led to a table for two. My husband had currywurst with potato salad and I could resist the comfort of Jägerschnitzel and spaetzle. Food was served timely. The currywurst wasn't appealing to the eye, but I couldn't wait to dig into the schnitzel. 

The schnitzel was delicious. Better then Cafe Heidelberg and world's better than Hofbräuhaus. Tender pork, crisp breading, creamy mushroom sauce. It could've only been better washed down with a full stein. Hopefully, they'll get their liquor license soon.

Now, the currywurst, on the other hand, wasn't up to par. The sauce itself was quite good, but the sausage? It was terribly fatty. The texture was very unpleasant. After a few bites we could eat no more. Fortunately, the schnitzel was enough for two.

We were glad we returned - food was great!  We got a lot more variety of food, beverages & an apple strudel to share for the same price as the previous night.  The owners checked with us during the meal, refilled non alcoholic beverages & exceeded our expectations. Both were happy to answer questions & converse between assisting other diners.

The 4 Star rating is because there wasn't a 4.5. As some others mentioned, there isn't a lot of ambience other than German music playing (low enough not to interfere with our conversation - a problem the night before at dinner even before the band started playing).

The quaint ambiance could use a little more to add to the vibe, but it wasn't necessary with the awesome staff taking orders in heavy German accent, and the delicious food.

So great we had to have it twice. 

While in Vegas for a business conference, we were looking for something away from the glitz and glam of the Strip. Cafe Berlin caught our eye and it was decided that we'd check it out, being lovers of German food and beer. 

This is exactly the sort of place that will appeal to those who are looking for something real and genuine in a city full of show. It's not a dive, but it's definitely got a mom and pop feel. App the place is owned by actual Germans, so that's a plus also. 

The food is fantastic. I had the Wurstplatte on the first night - it's a sausage sampler platter with three different types of brat. Each was delicious. It was served with more mashed potatoes than any person should eat, but eat them I did. It was served with a German potato salad that compliThe second night I had the Sauerbraten... 

My wife ordered the Frikadelle on the first night. It's a beef & gravy plate that was also very filling and super tasty - sehr lecker, as the Deutsch would say. Night two she ordered the Jager Schnitzel mit Cucumber Salad 

We're glad we found this cafe. It's away from the Strip and has some amazing food. The conference I attend goes to Vegas almost every year. Cafe Berlin gives me something to look forward to.",IQFwAXb9p_aJn2-XbEfAYw,2,0,5,skStn-xLJrOSNlmWKk1hBw

The Spaetzle where from the days before, do you know how old noodles taste when you warm them up the other day? And the meat was some kind of frozen two pieces of meat, what they  heated up in a pan!

The waitress also informed me the goulash would be a better choice and I am a sucker for good spaetzle. When it arrived I was pretty disappointed in the taste. The goulash was tasteless, each piece of meat had a giant strip of fat and the spaetzle was way creamier/more buttery than any I've had in Germany or elsewhere. Because it was quite expensive and I didn't want to have to eat it again I ate it all, but really didn't enjoy it. My friend got the jaegerschnitzel and that too had a greasy nasty taste to it. He said it was just ok.

I was amazed when I tried the pork wiener schnitzel for the first time. This is my favorite German dish. The crust was perfectly crisp and golden. The meat was sautéed just right. The flavor of lemon juice is all you need to make it perfect! I ordered the spaetzle as well and it was delicious. The appetizer pretzel is just what you expect. It is hot out of the oven, soft, and salty. A very good pretzel combo with the German mustard. You must try the homemade black forest cake. This cake is super moist and they infuse cherry juice into the whipped cream. This dessert is incredible. 

The only negative things I can say is the service can be really good and sometimes it can be slow. It just depends. Also my sister always gets the snitzel sandwich. Sometimes it comes out with a different bread type. You never know what bread it will be. Some days it's on a plate and other times it's in a basket. It should be uniform every time.

1624161,2013-10-29,0,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,Stopped in for lunch during the middle of the week. Place seems clean & wide open. First off it seems they don't know how to keep track of what patron comes in ahead of another. As we had another table come in a few minutes after us that they went to 1st to take an order from even though we were waiting to order & eventually had to flag down someone to take our order. Ordered a sausage sandwich with grilled onions & sauerkraut for $8.99. Pretty basic but took forever to come out of the kitchen. When it arrived there was hardly any sauerkraut or onions on the thing. I expected it to be heaping with onions & sauerkraut - if not heaping at least covering all the bread but there was maybe 1/8 cup on the thing. I love sauerkraut & that's why I ordered it. I had highly disappointed. The sausage itself was 2 smaller sausages about the length & girth of an average man's thumb. There was way too much extra bread with the sandwich they really should get smaller buns or larger sausages. Sausage & bread did have good flavor but nothing outstanding to make me want to return to the venue. It was served with regular old French's Yellow Mustard. What? Yes French's Mustard. No awesome German mustard's to be seen or informed of. One would expect a German restaurant to have at least a few German mustard's available. When it came time for the bill we just opted to hit the register rather than wait for our check as it was extremely busy & only 2 waitstaff that seemed like they were not used to a crowded restaurant (Probably only really 1 waitress but owner was trying to help out). I wouldn't go back.,uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,0,0,2,3YvRW7f2V7Q7QCAvfOsrNA

Long review: let me start with the main reason you're interested in this review-the food was beyond reasonably priced, authentic and generously portioned. My husband and I split the sampler platter for $43.99 which is great if you want a good portion of everything; note to self, we barely finished half, and we were stuffed! The sampler came with red and white sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, spaetzle smothered in butter, pickled cucumber salad, brown and yager gravy, at least two different juicy sausages, two moist and flavorful meat loaf patties and two generous portions of moist and tender schnitzel. The one con is that we were so stuffed, we had no room for dessert :/ 

The owner or manager, Bertram, was very hospitable and attentive. He affirmed that all the recipes were authentic, from his family. Ramona, our server, was so kind, patient and attentive-we even had a pleasant conversation about Germany and our families, over dinner. 

You do not have to go to the strip for a great meal! We cannot wait to go back. Ich liebe the food at cafe Berlin, and the people that work there aren't that bad, either.",usUq1tzlPcTR-AYgmbZSeg,0,0,5,0LSSXWWvPdKEC632Gc4XCg

It's in a strip mal behind an ARCO station and upon entry the décor looks like a steam puck art gallery after it's been looted. That's the end of the negatives as far as location and appearance.

The nitty gritty, My buddy orders the bratwurst platter and I order the Jagerschnitzel, we split an order of Kartoffel-Pfannkuchen. He seemed to like his brats, he wolfed them down. The Kartoffel-Pfannkuchen was perfectly thin and crisp. My Jagerschnitsel was awesome. crisp and crunchy even with the gravy. I have never been a fan of spoetzel but theirs is brilliant.

I had the pork Jaeger schnitzel lunch plate ($13) with ""hunters style"" mushroom gravy and spaetzle- the pork was a generous portion, nicely crispy, and the mushroom gravy was okay, had few actual mushrooms. The spaetzel was also just okay but had good texure. Dish seemed underseasoned.
BF had the bratwurst plate, largely due to the ""Best German Bratwurst in Vegas!"" sign by the front door. And I'll say, damn, it was good. For a $13 plate though, I kind of felt it should have more than one sausage link and simple, basic sides of (bland) cabbage and (decent) fried potatoes. The $10 brats in the sandwiches section of the menu would have been better.

Service was spotty. Our order was taken and dishes brought out, but we weren't really checked on and had to hunt down takeout boxes. Female server we saw at the beginning of our visit wasn't seen again. Seems the staff share all the service, which unfortunately leads to a lack of consistency, as no one knows who is doing what.

Food:
We ordered the jaeger schnitzel, the curry wurst and finished with a cherry strudel. The curry wurst was a grilled sausage with a German curry sauce (for those who have never had it, it's kind of like a ketchup with less complex sugars and more taste) and it was good. But the jaeger schnitzel was phenomenal and definitely lived up to the recommendations. It had the perfect crisp and yet was still a succulent chop. Not to mention the mushroom gravy that it is served. Though we were pretty much full we still went for the cherry strudel and it was also amazing. 

The portions are pretty decently sized and though it's not designed for family-style eating, many of the dishes are easy to share and I would encourage you to do so.

Also, when we can, I really wanna try their buffet....*Homer Simpson voice* mmmm.....sausage buffet

Drink:
Besides your standard fare of soft drinks they have beer. Now, while they do not have a wide variety of beers, what they do have are good German choices. We went with the Warsteiner Dunkel, a good beer in it's own right, and a great compliment to the dishes. 

Atmosphere:
We went sort of near closing time so it was pretty empty. It was lavish with decorations, and still had the looks of a simple shop, but it still felt homey (to me anyways). It can, however, accommodate large groups. 

Staff:
Our server was very friendly and was helpful as much as possible. Since, as I noted, we went near closing and it wasn't that busy, I cannot comment how service is during a rush. But, I was pleased with their aim to please and I am willing to bet their service doesn't falter when they get busier.

It was very busy, and they seemed a bit understaffed but still did a great job getting us and our wheelchair-dependent little one to a table. There was some confusion between the first person who took our drinks order and the server, because they never did bring out the wine my wife ordered or the water I ordered (they did get her water and my German beer, though!)... so a point off, but overall was a great choice.

A few girlfriends and I get together once a month for dinner. I saw this place while getting gas one day on my lunch break, Yelped it, and after reading all the positive reviews told the girls we should check it out. I chose this night in particular because they have the dinner buffet. Every first Saturday of the month they offer an ayce buffet. It says reservations are recommended on buffet night, but I would say they are mandatory. This place is small on the inside with maybe 10-12 tables, and they were all full. We had resos for 4pm and were seated promptly. Someone took our drink order and showed us to the buffet table. Now keep in mind I have never had German food before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. 

The buffet is small, but everything looked good. They had about 5 hot trays with different offerings. Mashed potatoes, spaetzle, roasted chicken, veggies, red cabbage, sauerkraut, 3 different types of sausages, schnitzel, 3 different gravies, potato salad, and a few small desserts. I tried some of everything and hands down my favorite thing was the schnitzel with mushrooom gravy. The schnitzel was crispy and flavorful, and the mushroom gravy was a delicious complement. If no one was watching, I might have licked my plate clean. I went back for seconds for this.

I didn't care for the sausages too much or the spaetzle. The sausages tasted all the same to me. Unfortunately the sign at the buffet just said ""sausages,"" so I wasn't too sure what I was actually eating. My main complaint is the dessert, or lack thereof. At the end of the buffet there was a paper plate that had a few mini muffins and some chocolate and powdered mini donuts, like the kind you buy in a 6 pack at the gas station. Pretty lame. They do have a dessert case with black forest cake and different kinds of homemade strudel. My suggestion would be to have some of those items included in the buffet for dessert. My last complaint would be the price tag on the buffet. For the amount of items, most of them being sides, I think the price is a bit too high. It's not a deal breaker though. I will definitely be back. If you are thinking about checking this place out I would suggest going on buffet night, so you can taste a little bit of everything and see what you like. I will be back for sure.

Long review - 

My husband and I went to Cafe Berlin two nights ago for the first time. We arrived late (The place closes at 8:00 PM Monday through Friday) so we ordered a combo meal to go.

Like most places in the valley, this place is located in a small strip mall behind a fast food restaurant and a gas station. You won't have any problems parking here and there are plenty of tables for those who wish to dine in.

Our combo meal had different brats, schnitzel, spaetzle , two types of sauerkraut and what looked like a german hamburger (Not sure what it's called). 

We loved everything. The food was fresh and the staff was friendly. They told us (in a thick german accent) to sit down and get comfortable while we wait for our take-out order. We sipped delicious german beers while  our food was being prepared.

I will definitely be back. This place feels like a jewel in the rough. You don't' expect to find a great german restaurant in a strip mall behind a gas station, but it works and our experience was delightful.",ssOoXFDC4ObeQKF2TvHNCw,1,0,4,35lNKk4ZR2jbVXwv97g3qw

That's all I have to say. If you want to try authentic to the bone German food, Cafe Berlin is the place to be. 

My friend and I decided to hit up Cafe Berlin. She never had German food before. Me? Had it many times abroad. I was more than happy to order anything and everything on the menu. Just to try out if it's really authentic. 

Since it's my friend's first time eating German food, the server suggested the Sampler Platte. It's basically bratwurst, sauerkraut, mashed potato and schnitzel. Good serving for two people.

They also have daily specials however if you do show up near closing time, they usually run out by then. Oh draft beer specials. Please just drink German beer and stay away from American beer. It'll go well with your meal. Trust me.

The restaurant is quaint with around 15 tables (some high tops) and a small bar at the front..  The tables are nothing fancy but the decor fits perfect with the name because it definitely gives you the cafe vibe with red table cloth and German decorations adorning the walls.  There's a small display case at the front as well that shows of some delicious strudel (more on that later).  They have a TV which appears to have a cable box but was being used to showcase the different dishes they have while we were there.  While we were there they had live accordion music playing and a sprinkling of Christmas decorations including a tree.  The live music I thought would be a bit overpowering in the space but turned out to be just the right noise level so as to not overpower our conversation.  

The menu was just what we were looking for with various schnitzels, sausages, and traditional sides.  They also had a decent offering of German beer which they served in the proper glass by beer style (i went with a hefeweizen).  I went with the Jaeger schnitzel and my wife had the sauerbraten both with spaetzle.  We also split a side of potato salad.  The schnitzel (with pork) was crispy without being greasy and the mushroom gravy was delicious.  The spaetzle was a good side made even better with the gravy mixed in.  The beef in the saurbraten was very tender and the sauce was very tasty, not as good as the mushroom gravy, but a close second.  The potato salad was more of a mustard base than i'm used too (my family makes german potato salad more vinegar based and served warm) but it had a nice flavor just the same.

The staff was very friendly, they sat us relatively quickly and got our order in a timely fashion considering all the tables save a high top was occupied and they had 2 servers.  The food came out pretty fast as well and they kept tabs on our drinks too.

I had a 10% discount which they forgot to apply to the bill but happily provided us a  free plate of apple strudel in trade (which we happily accepted).  The strudel was served warm with some whipped cream and a creamy sauce as well.  They had cherry and blackberry as well which i'm sure are just as tasty.  

the only thing that could have been better was the iced tea.  I'm not sure if it was a specific kind or just an off batch, but it was pretty watered down.  Given all the other pluses we'll certainly be there again to find out.

2350699,2015-01-05,4,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,"Came here to try their monthly buffet and have decided this place is mediocre at best...This place is way over-rated! How they have an average of nearly 5 stars is beyond me because I would not come back, especially at the prices they're charging! $22.99 for a dinner buffet is ridiculous when you walk in and see this hole in the wall joint and their tiny spread of about 7 or 8 items on the ""buffet"", with most of those items being sides such as sauerkraut, red cabbage, mashed potates, spaetzle, etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked the sides, but just wish there were more entree type items instead of just the 4: assorted sausages, schnitzel, roasted chicken, and some hamburger patty looking thing .

The dessert spread is also a joke, with most of it being stale and looking worse than Hostess packaged snacks...why wasn't there any Black Forest cake or strudel? And why does a German buffet serve stale cupcakes and cookies? The buffet includes a soft drink but if you want beer that will cost extra. If you want a pretzel or real dessert, such as strudel, you'll have to pay extra too. So where does the $22.99 I'm paying for the ""buffet"" go? 

The staff was nice and kept coming by to check on us and refill our drinks. There was a little confused when we arrived because they couldn't figure out my reservation and we eventually figured out that they had for some reason crossed me off the list even though a reserved tag with my name on it was cleared set on the table. Reservations are recommended here at any given time because their place is so tiny and it for some reason gets very packed.

I wouldn't say that I'm an expert when it comes to German food but I've definitely had some way better places, and at cheaper pricing too. There aren't many German joints in Vegas but I'd say one of my favorites anywhere is still Hoffbrauhaus, which is surprisingly cheaper than this place! Yeah it doesn't make sense to me either...I'd say skip this place and save your money!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,1,2,ZoV2QyyNkYPpCfdhLhQFEQ

Friends and I went for lunch and were not disappointed.  I had the Zigeuner schnitzel and they had the regular schnitzels.  I asked for mine with spaetzle, which was not a problem.  I found mine to be very flavorful, with a tasty bell pepper sauce and large pieces of pepper in it.  They were also very happy.  Apple streudel for dessert was also tasty and seemed homemade, which they confirmed.  Overall, the place is a little spartan on the inside, but you can tell they are starting out and I can only imagine the place getting better and more refined as time goes on, if they are successful.  Plenty of other tasty things on the menu I will try later, such as jaegerschnitzel, currywurst, and a variety of other sausages and such.  

The $10 off yelp coupon only made it even sweeter...3 lunches with 2 streudels, an iced tea, and tax..$23 + $10 for the cost of the yelp coupon.  Definitely one of the better german meals I have had in town.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,1,0,5,oqlWY0QFPXlo3lEL8pxciQ

For food their menu consist of various sausages, sandwiches/burgers, and dishes like Schweine Schnitzel ""Wiener Art"" and Cordon Bleu com Schwein. They also make strudels and other pastries.  I decided on the Bratwurst Burger, I believe it was a 1/2 lbs burger topped with sautéed onions. It was very delicious and juicy. It also came with some fries, all for $8.50. It seems like they use to have 4 burgers the North, South, East, and West Burgers but crossed it off their menu for the Bratwurst Burger.

They also have some Euro Cup soccer or football specials. My other friends went with the Bier Bratwurst Stadium Style with German mustard and fries, it looked good too. They said it tasted good.

Conversed with owners. They were very friendly and always checking on us. They've been open for about 2 month and still fine tuning their restaurant. Their son is handling all of the marketing and business aspects of the restaurant. He said they have lots of deals on yelp but I couldn't them, all good maybe next time.

There was a Euro cup game playing between Germany and Greece. When we came in it 1-0 Germany when we left it was 4-1 and Germany dominated, you're welcome LOL. It seems like a place that should service German beer too. At least they're working on getting their liquor license, so I can't wait for that.

There are a lot of seats and tables for dining. There's also large USA and Germany flags hanging on the walls with a flat screen tv.

Updated...I actually paid about $13 for my burger, fries, and water which is kinda price for what I got. So reduced from 4 to 3.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,6,1,3,4mblNhBCkHRCVLDIsnB7YA

The bullet points:

Pros:
Great food
Good service
Nice facility

Cons:
Cooking time (potentially)
A bit pricey

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The details:

Pros:
Great food - Tasty wursts, well-seasoned meatloaves, crispy-tender schnitzel, giant soft pretzels with crispy crusts and soft and squishy insides, spaetzle with a good amount of chew, nicely flavored sauerkraut and red cabbage and pickled cucumbers on the side, & fresh veggies.
The portions were very large, so we have lunch for tomorrow. Yay!

Good Service - When we came in on Saturday just before 5:30, there were 2 friendly ladies on the floor. We were seated quickly, we got our drinks and ordered as soon as we were ready, and they were very attentive throughout our meal. We got our check quickly and they were nice enough to pack up our leftovers for us.

Nice Facility - The tables, floor, and fixtures were clean and well maintained. The bathrooms were clean. The decor was kind of steam punk-ish?, but hung together nicely enough. Lots of curtains allowed some natural light in without leaving us blinded by direct sunlight. It's also pleasantly quiet. While I am, sometimes, in the mood for loud music and raucous crowds, sometimes, I just want a peaceful meal with my family; Cafe Berlin delivered.

Cons:
Cooking time - The menu clearly states that some food takes longer to serve because they make it from scratch. I can appreciate that, and I didn't mind, but it's something to be aware of if you have a show or a movie to plan around.

Maybe a bit pricey - Ok, so it's not cheap, but I am still willing to pay, and tip, for good quality food that is prepared well. It's not a deal breaker.

Overall:
We'll be back and we'll recommend to others.",besiA1REWgLKsWGZFLdpBw,0,0,5,PkfOw7HQrJhPQ-peyd83Ng

This trip, one of the local guys says ""hey, there's a new German place that opened.""  So we went to check it out.

We were greeting promptly by (I assume) one of the owners and then a waitress came up, with her ever so slight German accent telegraphing to me that yes, the food will be good.

Sure enough, it was.  A variety of Schnitzel graced our table, and even the West German burger ordered by one of our less adventurous coworkers looked awesome.

At the end of the meal, the chef came around to see how we liked it.  Then the owner told us about their catering menu, including their amazing strudel.  He brought us an end cut sample of strudel, and it was AMAZING.

If you're in Vegas to party, I don't think you'd make the trek out here, but if you're looking for authentic German food, or if you're local and live or work in the area, definitely check this place out.

The only thing I'd add would be some taps with German beer, but I bet that's in their plans.",m7mQf4FbNRZ6u1wrHEmonQ,6,4,5,ID5nw2S7MPGi0YNWpFQx1g

The place was empty and the server was nice and attentive but not anything special. I had asked for a specific salad dressing and he had told me they don't have it when they did. I had also said no onions and they were still on there. 
The iced tea was watered down or something as tasted very bland. There were only pork protein options except one dish. I don't typically eat pork except ribs so I got the one meat dish. The sauerbraten was very fatty meat but the part I did have was good in a nice sauce. The bread we got was skimpy, no rolls like in the picture and it was stale rye bread. His jaeger schnitzel was good as I had a few bites but I liked my sauce better. The spaetzle was also bland but looked like it should have so much more flavor. his beer also came in a liquor glass... Seemed odd but maybe a cultural thing and didnt seem to be the amount of beer stated on menu. The 6-10 bites of food I had was decent hence the two stars. Also if I ate more pork it might have been different... The only other German restaurant I went to at least had chicken options or something. The only chicken had ham with it and the waiter said couldn't make without it as already done. 
Now I have a sweet tooth... Apple pie is one of my favorites... However the picture of the strudel didn't seem appetizing as 80% pastry and 20% apple. Oh well saved me the calories. Maybe German isn't my thing, maybe just an off day and I should keep an open mind and give one more try, but with all the restaurants out there I like and that I haven't tried yet, it will not be a rush back.",-8syaSLDbMXW2F2FApVgig,5,1,2,n96oIMPmz3u7ODFNsIaCDA

Wifey spent much of her childhood in Germany and loves Jaeger schnitzel.  She was not pleased with the version here.  Usually the cutlets are pounded thin, these were uncharacteristically thick.  The breading was way too salty.  I tried a bite and did not want another.  Note: I've never met a schnitzel I didn't like.  I'm a schnitzel eating fool, but I didn't want a second bite.  Nuff said.

I'm all about the wurst over here, so I went with the Nuernberger Rostbratwuerst.  They come to the table leaning casually on a mound of mashed potatoes, full of promise.  Right alongside, in perfect counterpoint, sits a generous serving of sauerkraut.  It was such a pretty picture.

But damn my eyes!  It looked WAY better than it tasted.  

I feel obligated to apologize for saying this, but the mashed potatoes were terrible.  They were whipped into oblivion.  The texture was unpleasant, the taste was unappealing.  At the same time, however, the kraut was exceptionally good.  The sausages were the biggest disappointment.  I don't think I even finished them.  Even with a good beer, I was like, no.

My nephew accompanied us and he got the Bratwurst burger.  He said it was great.  If I went back, that's what I'd try.

We just entered the plaza and decided to eat at Cafe Berlin since neither of us has ever had German food before. When we entered the restaurant, there were absolutely no customers and there were three people at the counter talking to each other (waitress, possible owner, and another guy). The waitress quickly brought out menus for us and got our drink orders (coffee and Spezi. She was definitely German, she had a very heavy German accent and everything; it was pretty cool. 

I wouldn't say we really ordered authentic German dishes since I just got the daily special Gyspy Style Sausage w/ french fries ($6.50) and Don got The North German burger ($8.50) with a side of Spaetzle ($2.95), but they were still very good. My sausage really tasted homemade and had a lot of flavor and the french fries that came with it were cooked to perfection. Don's burger had beef chuck, garlic shrimp, tomato, lettuce, and coleslaw. The garlic shrimp were definitely an interesting, yet tasty, little add-on. 

While we were eating, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted refills, of course we said yes. However, I wish I hadn't because I ended up getting charged for every cup of regular coffee I got. I really bugs me when people charge per cup of REGULAR coffee. I would've gotten some other beverage, like Spezi, since that came bottomless.

Who knew you could find authentic German food in the Las Vegas Valley? Cafe Berlin is randomly placed in the tiniest strip mall ever with two other food places and a insurance office. Weird.

I noticed this place after pumping gas across the parking lot and decided to try it out. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the decor; the place is set up like an old school cafeteria buffet with Red, Yellow, and Black colors everywhere to represent the German Flag. There are also a lot of German themed posters and even a clock that gives the current time for Las Vegas and the current for the city of Berlin. I was happily greeted at the door and was told I could sit anywhere. 

I sat down and browsed the menu and immediately noticed numerous tasty delicacies which reminded me of my Gam-Gam's cooking. I mean we're talking bratwurst, liverwurst, and a new thing I had never heard of called, ""Currywurst"". I saw the house special and thought to myself, ""when in Germany""...""I'll have the Jaeger Schnitzle and the Spaeztle please!"" Within about 10 minutes I had a piping hot plate of authentic German food in front of me. If you're not familiar with Schnitzle it's basically a meat of some type, usually pork, that has pounded flat, breaded, and fried. Yummy! 

This plate of food was delicious! The Schnitzle, in this case pork, was super tender and cooked perfectly; juicy on the inside, nice and crunchy on top. This plate of food also came with a side dish called Spaeztle, which is a soft egg noodle with very little taste. I mixed mine with the mushroom gravy that was on top of my Schnitzle. Even though there wasn't much flavor on these noodles they still added to the meal and complimented the saltines of the gravy. 

I inhaled this meal and was a fat, happy little German boy all over again. Just as I was awakening from my food coma and was just about to pay the check, I saw a giant pretzel come out of the kitchen, made in-house and fried to order. This giant twisted carb loaded goodness would not escape my grip and I ordered one for the road. I actually ate half of it on my way home, so soft and delicious how could you say no? This giant knotted doughy treat come with two different dipping sauces: a cheese and dijon mustard. So good! 

Cafe Berlin is awesome. Great customer service, quick food preparation and a very chill atmosphere. They also serve a small selection of German beers if you feel like getting the full Berlin experience. 

I will definitely be back to try the Wurstplate with three different types of sausage goodness.

The atmosphere was gemütlich (comfortable, cozy, homey) as there was a live two-man band offering a variety of German and non-German music for our dining pleasure.  The musicians were also engaging with the patrons and their varied instruments made heads turn.
The food was cooked to perfection and it was clear that the chef had a deep understanding of how German food presents its flavors.  The food does not use a wide assortment of herbs and spices, but rather the essence of the natural combined ingredients creates the flavor.
The portions were extraordinarily generous and it was a struggle to save room for dessert.  The Black Forest cake with hand-whipped cream was our choice (we had to share it because we were stuffed from the meal).
Our waitress/hostess explained the meals and the preparation.  She was on the excitement curve with regards to letting us know what the restaurant offerings were.

3411702,2014-10-20,3,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,"Personally, German food is one of my favorite things, like... Ever. I have had German Hasenpeffer listed on my Yelp ""Last Meal On Earth"" since I opened my account! If that's not enough proof, then I don't know what is.

When I went off to college (the first time), I would often go back home to visit my mother in Massachusetts during the summers. Mom knew there were a few traditions I always expected to be upheld in those warm, New England months. The primary being at least one trip over to a restaurant known as The Fort/The Student Prince. There lives the origin and appreciation I have for German food. The interior alone seems to transport you to a restaurant in Freiburg im Breisgau.

Cafe Berlin does not really transport you anyplace at all, but quite honestly, it really doesn't have to. The food is what shines here. Not to trash talk or anything, but I have been to Hofbrauhaus, which one would think would give you that more authentic German experience, but all you seem to get there is boring food, a high bill, and your butt paddled. It ends up becoming more of a tourist experience rather than a German one.

Cafe Berlin delivers the opposite. The interior is pretty ""meh"", and you may not receive a spanking from some waitress dressed up in a dirndl costume, but the food takes you away. I came with Marie T., and we decided on the homemade pretzel with cheese as our starter. The extra dollar gets you this awesome looking cheese with green onion, radish and paprika sprinkled on top, instead of just mustard. I would recommend it.

I also chose the Radler ""bier"". I have had it before, at RX Boiler Room, and really enjoyed it. I was excited to see it on the menu here, as this has been the only other place I have seen it served.

We both settled on the Jager Schnitzel, which we split for two reasons. One, the portions are huge here. The second one being that the prices here are fairly high. The Jager Schnitzel is almost $19 a plate. That is fairly standard pricing, as far as this type of food goes for now. But just as a warning, be expected to spend more than you might initially think. But also know that it's worth it. Our meal was excellent, as well as the service.

They may not have my hasenpeffer, but what they do have here is a man playing the accordion during your meal. For that reason ALONE, you need to get yourself down here!",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,7,6,4,1VcKNss6j_JYAhKeFCYIFw

We were seated by an employee but the waitress didn't notice we were there for several minutes, and apologized when she finally became aware of our presence. xD For the rest of the meal, service was very friendly. The employees are actually German and very proud of this little restaurant; the owner apparently came here from Germany just to open this restaurant!

My friend and I decided to order their sampler platter, which came with A TON of food, though we managed to finish it all.

The latter is a ""replica"" of the original in Munich. Their food is good -- though, incomparable to what's served at the HB in Munich --  but I don't consider it to be the best in town. 

What I like about Café Berlin is the quality of the food. On my first visit, I really enjoyed the Currywurst I ordered, but their Jägerschnitzel was what finally made me give them 5-Stars. It's difficult to dislike their Jägerschnitzel: breaded pork cutlet, creamy mushroom sauce, and tender Spätzle; it's mouthwatering! Unlike HB's, the breaded pork cutlet wasn't tough. Everything about it was awesome.

If any room is left in your belly, I'd suggest giving the apple strudel a try. It's a good finale to a hearty, German meal. Perfect for sharing if you're already feeling a little stuffed, and it isn't overly sweet. 

The restaurant isn't as spartan as when it first opened, and they now play German radio stations. Service here is attentive, but keep in mind that the food's not going to arrive on your table right after you place an order. They do take their time here preparing meals.

Located at Sunset and Decatur in Las Vegas. I would make reservations if I were you since the restaurant is small. I had Jaegar Schnitzel which was delicious and filling. Their food is authentic and everything was made fresh and homemade. The menu showcast a great selection of schnitzel, brats, and other traditional dishes.

The service was great. The husband and wife (owners) were very nice.

I learned they have a buffet on the first Saturday of each month which would be nice to try out. I believe they also have a rewards program for lunch. In addition, 
I want to check out the live music which happens on last Saturday of the month at 5pm.

My friends all got their food first, which was to their liking for the most part (except for one of them not knowing that they put mustard inside of the cordon blue since the menu doesn't state such). Here's where things turn POSSIBLY DEADLY; out comes my cordon blue and i take the first bite and notice that it was luke warm. At first I didn't think anything about it, as I thought that since mine came late it had just been sitting in back waiting on the spaetzle to be cooked. Upon the second bite I immediately spit it out because the entire piece of coated fried chicken was TOTALLY RAW!!! I mean it looked like the filet had just come out of the refrigerator. I was so angry that I immediately brought it to the attention of the  waitress. While they brought me something else to eat for free and didn't charge me for the entree and apologized a few times; this is simply something that can NEVER OCCUR...EVER! While I appreciate their apologies, I had to spend the next 24 hours worrying about my health; as I did fully eat the first piece. Perhaps a better way to serve this dish would be to cook the chicken by itself, then place the ham and cheese on top of the fully cooked fried chicken. This way the chance of reoccurrence will be next to nill, since the chicken being fried is much thinner and does not have the other ingredients stuffed into it. Quite frankly this is the kind of experience that I wish I would have never had. They could have given me a $500. gift card and I would have never accepted it because I would never come back to an establishment for a mistake such as this. Their simply is just no excuse for a mistake of this kind, as this can KILL someone!

I went here for the AYCE buffet on the last Saturday of every month. It was my first time and I was hoping to have a chance to explore their entire (or most of it) during that event. Only to be disappointed with having the average stuff. 

schnitzel, it was pan fried for sure. The chef- owner kept refilling the station, literally having fried 5 small prices of Schnitzel in a standard size cast-iron pan. Some of the schnitzel were perfectly cooked, some of them were too brown/crispy/burned on one side.

Sausages, they serve 3 kind during the AYCE buffet, so they were so-so, in my opinion. I love German sausages...they run in my blood, they didn't have the Brötchen (bread) for me to put them in, as you would like back home. The curry sauce was so-so. Not like I remember from my favorite curry wurst stand back home. 

Rotkohl was good. I have been looking for a decent brand to by in store, but have not found one like back home. The rot kohl here was close enough to the taste I crave every now and then.

Bouletten (Frikadelle) was ok, a little on the dry side. They kept falling apart when I ate them. Just like the schnitzel, they were either ok, or burned on one side.

Salads were average. I did like the cucumber salad. I wish they would offer some more authentic like Bohnen salat.

They had mini cupcakes and a few assorted cookies for desert, nothing too memorable or German. Mini cupcakes are the ones from costco or walmart you can buy, with the circle sugar sprinkles.

I have to try their regular menu on a regular day, to see what all the good reviews are about. Otherwise the AYCE was a miss for me. 

I did like how it was off the strip and away from the hofbrauhaus drinking crowd. I could actually focus on eating rather than  trying to dodge he biersteins.",c72nKRCJ8f4afpUE1tGciQ,2,0,3,l_XoJo7gxkd-emdW6cnJug

My husband lived in Germany for a few years as an Army brat and always raved about the food so he was an easy sell. We finally dined there this past Saturday and it did NOT disappoint!
I called dibs on the Jaegar Schnitzel and since we never like to be ""matchy matchy"" in our choices he went with the Wurstplatte to get a taste of their main sausages. Meal wasn't quick to come out but I am pretty forgiving of this at mom-and-pops, especially when the food comes out hot and tasty. Check and check.

4074567,2014-01-07,2,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,"This review is for Cafe Berlin's once a month German buffet. They have it on the first Saturday of every month. I just happened to try this place for the first time on their buffet night. The buffet has a huge following, and reservations are necessary. We saw some people turned away when they showed up sans reservations. The buffet is $19.99 per person and includes a soda or iced tea. I think the price is a little high for what you get unless you are a big eater.

There is a small table in the corner set up with a few chafing dishes, like at a dinner party. I'm not sure if the selections change, but the options we had on the buffet were: cucumber salad, potato salad, peas with carrots, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spaetzle, one kind of brown sausage, pork schnitzel, chicken schnitzel, Frikadelle (German meatballs), and fried Spam. There were some gravies and mustard but that was it. Very limited but most items were very tasty. The weirdest thing was the dessert option: a puff pastry topped with cherry or vanilla pudding, marshmallows and Cool Whip. It was good but it reminded me of something my white trash aunt would bring to the family potluck dinners when I was younger.

The small restaurant was packed for the special buffet night and the kitchen had a difficult time keeping up with the crowd; whenever a cook would come out with a pan of fresh food, people descended on them like locusts. At least the stuff was prepared fresh but you had to be on your toes to get something, especially the schnitzel. As soon as it was put out, it was gone. They also ran out of plates several times (but this was quickly remedied).

There is one major thing I really dislike about the buffet. For the steep per person price, pretzels and strudel are NOT included. That's kind of sticking it to you when, let's be honest, all of us want a dang pretzel and some apple strudel when we eat at a German restaurant. I ordered the pretzel anyway, but having to pay extra rubbed me the wrong way (especially when the one I was served was overcooked and almost burnt). It would be nice if the owners would include one or two pretzels and one strudel per table with the buffet. 

Note that if you go on the buffet night, that is your ONLY OPTION. We were told that you CANNOT order regular dishes off the menu (only beer, wine, strudel and pretzels). The service was good and the German employees were so kind and welcoming. The decor ain't great but the place has its charm. 

I did enjoy the food and I am anxious to return on a non-buffet night. The cucumber salad, spaetzle and red cabbage were true standouts! I will update my review after my next visit. The spaetzle was particularly authentic, it took me back to my trips to Germany!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,7,3,4,7c0-kwaQg7YCciECre7Erw

There's inside seating only with a bar. They have a cool pipe and light wall with one restroom for men and one for women. 

Pretzel appetizer- nicely salted, outer was a little done for my taste with a soft center. Mustard dipper. 

I ordered the Wiener Art. I was disappointed in the size of the schnitzel (about the size of a woman's hand) but the taste was nice, mostly buttery and a nice breaded taste. The breaded crunch was golden and on the thinner side. The schnitzel itself was about a quarter inch thick. The cold potato salad was a hit at our table, you're given a pretty good heaping of it. 

My husband ordered the Curry Worst which was fantastic! I really enjoyed the curry sauce, not spicy. This dish came with half the plate of thin cut fries, perfectly cooked and drained. 

We ordered the Black Forrest cake for dessert, it was really moist and delicious. This is a chocolate cake layered with strawberries and whipped cream. They don't skimp on the whipped cream!",XdLQep9R3V7EHwW2fjgK-g,1,1,3,U5DBoxyvowaoorKNw3yv-A

I ordered Jaeger Schnitzle. The pork looked burnt at first but was perfectly cooked. Despite being smothered in a delicious mushroom gravy, it retained a certain crunchiness.  The spaetzl was a little off putting to me. Its taste was not unlike egg and starch. I ate it but I had to mix it with the gravy on my plate. The apple struedel was supurb. Very sweet though. The flakey chewieness with the crunch from the walnuts was great and the warm vanilla sauce was heavenly.

As for the restaurant itself, unimpressive yet redeeming. It is not full of the stereotypical Bavarian decor found in other establishments. It stays below that irritating status of kitch. The only thing German in the restaurant, other than the food, is a couple of German flags and empty bottles of Warsteiner beer on the tables. It is small and simple with good food and good service.

The second time was three days ago and it seemed like they did not have a real chef because the food came out one at a time with very long time in between food coming from the kitchen almost as if each was cooked individually. This time the Spaetzle were a starchy, watery mess (way overcooked) not sure how somebody can screw this up. Interestingly enough the Cordon Bleu (pork) was burned around the corners and I had to work my way half way through the thing to get a bite of ham and cheese. definitely no comparison to my first visit here.

Cheaper than others in town
Friendly waitress

Cons
Food inconsistent

The female server came out of the kitchen and served  the couple behind us 25 minutes after we sat down.  They did not recognized what they had ordered.  The server went to the window at the kitchen and talk to the chef.  I heard her say she gave the food to the wrong table.

Coming back from vacation in Germany with my girlfriend, we immediately craved German cuisine (didn't really feel like going back immediately to American food). The first time around I had the bier brat plate and my girlfriend had the normal brat. We also got a pretzel with cheese and mustard as an appetizer (recommended). Second time around was just as great. Decided to go with the Nuernberger Rostbratwuerst'l (A different thinner brat over mashed potatoes and sauerkraut) which did not disappoint. Very Filling if I must say. I recommend having a good German beer to pair with your plate. Particularly a Paulaner Hefeweizen if you're into that style. It sounds stereotypical but Germany truly does have some of the best selection of beers. 
All dishes were delicious, the food tasted the same as back in Germany and the portions are
large so the extra $$ you spend is worth it.

The service isn't bad, usually there's about 2 servers for the size of the place. All of them were nice and will check on you periodically. Nothing crazy spectacular but they also get the job done in what's needed. 

They do tell you right off the bat that their food is authentic and made fresh to order so there will be a just a tad of a wait. So at least they set expectations. I don't see the point in some of these reviews on yelp to where the server clearly told the customer that there will be a wait but yet the customer still complained about it in a review. No sense there, Id rather have good authentic food than a quick inefficient dinner.

My child's chicken fingers were overcooked and dry. This in contrast to my previous review that I would have ordered the chicken fingers if I could have. The worst part was the mashed potatoes, which I seriously believe we're actually instant potatoes. C'mon!

Came here with April P. tonight not knowing exactly what to expect. We've both never had German cuisine before and decided to push our boundaries a little. 

The place was pretty simple with really chill staff who let us choose our own seats. Without a standard to set my observations on, I can't quite tell whether all casual German restaurants are decorated this way but it lacked that foreign vibe I expected to get from a supposedly authentic European restaurant. The 3 stars is not based on that because I don't want my ignorance on the culture to affect how people perceive how the restaurant really is.

My rating has more to do with the food than with the vibe alone. I ordered a Schweine Schnitzel ""Wiener Art"" which consisted of two large servings of flattened, breaded pork served with a side of German potato salad. While it tasted pretty good (and boy was the serving huge), I wouldn't say it was exceptional enough for me to go out of my way just to come back. Of course, I will not base conclusions on the rest of the menu after trying only one dish and still plan to try out the strudels, bratwursts and sauerkraut one day. 

Location is pretty far down southeast, quite a drive from the strip, in a dark complex fronted by a gas station. Hard to find if someone is not purposely going here.

1.  The waiters (owners?) spoke German to each other, so there's some authenticity.

2.  A previous reviewer mentioned Kantine.  I see his point - the food is all very good, but comparable food in Germany can be found in lower-end restaurants.

3.  The portions were rather small compared to German portions.  Think kleine schnitzel.  Therefore, the price seemed a bit on the high side.

4.  The waiters (owners) were super friendly though.  And they serve Paulaner ($6.95 for a half-liter).  You can even get Eine Mass size.

5.  The best food in Berlin isn't German (Turkish).  This place reminded me more of Bavarian food (spaetzle, weisswurst, the beer), which is a good thing (not sure what the Berlin connection is).

6.  They have specials depending on the day of the week.  Saturday is schweinhaxe (dang it, I came on Friday).  They also have a buffet one day a week and the waiter admitted that lunch is busier than dinner.  Located in a strip mall off of Decatur.

7.  I checked in on Yelp, and a 10% discount popped up for dinner for two.  I asked if this applied to my lunch for five, but he said nein.

It's a pretty relaxed environment. The inside looks more like a quick diner wedged in a shopping center. It's got a small area for bar seating if you want to grab a good German beer ($4-$6). Good for kids too. We had our 18 month old who acted completely obnoxious and she was tolerated. Other families had children there as well.

The service can be a bit slow at times, but always friendly.  I have to say, that I of course am not German, but have probably spent about 5-6 months of time overall in Germany over the many years.

1. The sausages - I am here for sausages and one other thing, or two other things really.  They do not disappoint. I have had all of their sausages here, the Neurnberger, the Bier Bratwurst, the bratwurst and the curry wurst.   Each is very good, but I enjoy the larger sized sausages, so the Bier Bratwurst, the bratwurst and the Curry Wurst are all my favorites.  Each dish will come with sauerkraut. I cannot say I am a  connoisseur of fermented cabbage, although I love Kim Chee.  So I will just say I ate all my sauerkraut and no problem!

2.  The Pretzel- Yep, the second reason I am here is for the big ass pretzel.  What a great tasting pretzel.  If you get it with the Obatzer Kase spread, it is delicious.

3.  The Beer - Yep a whole pitcher of German Draft Beer.  How can you go wrong.

Come here, relax, chill out, have bit of Black Forest Cake when you are done.  Don't expect the quickest German efficient service, don't expect to get everything in a second or to be perfect.  Just accept that this is a family run place and that the food is pretty darn good and authentic.

I had the jaegerschnitzel and a bier bratwurst on the side.  If they are offering homemade sausages for $2.99 to add to your meal, it would have been rude of me not to get one, right?

The jaegerschnitzel is made with either pork or chicken.  I've only had this dish previously with veal, but the pork was good.  It comes with mushroom gravy and a good sized helping of spaetzle.  The spaetzle was slightly grilled, which gave it some texture.  This dish can be a bit too ""mushy"" for me at times.  I loved a bite with the crispy pork, brown gravy and spaetzle.  

The sausage was big time, juicy and grilled perfectly.  As much as I enjoyed the jaegerschnitzel, I think the sausage was the star.

We had good service, didn't wait too long for our lunches, but we had to wait some time for refills of our drinks.  The parking lot is small, and there are several restaurants, so that's a minus.

5028834,2012-12-19,2,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,"Café Berlin is a very nice, comfortable diner for a variety of German bratwursts and schnitzels! Yes, German beer and wine, too! Go enjoy!

LONG VERSION: 
- It's a medium size, bright, comfortable café/diner with family style atmosphere; located in a small plaza by a gas station and Popeyes. 

It has an impressive lunch and dinner menu [See Pics] with several choices of bratwursts and schnitzels; along with a few kinds of German beers and wine by the bottle.

I went there for late lunch around 2:30pm on a Tue, it was understandably not too crowded, with only 3 tables of customers there. The owner was working all alone by herself, from taking/bringing out orders to bussing tables and manning the register! She was very friendly and helpful, chatting up with customers, to some of them in German. I take that as a sign of a place for good genuine German food!

I had a Nuenberger bratwurst sandwich with sauerkraut and grilled onions ($8.99), and a bottle of dark beer ($4.99). The bratwurst was grilled to perfection with somewhat cripy skin outside and juicy and flavorful inside, tasty in every bite. The grilled onions added wonderful aroma and taste. The sauerkraut had the right acidity I liked, but was a bit overcooked. The mustard came in a small squeeze bottle. It did not have any special taste. So, I decided to do without it on my bratwurst. The bottle of dark beer, Warsteine, was excellent, though on the expensive side.  I wish Café Berlin would eventually serve draft beers! I also had coffee, which was hot enough, but pretty weak.

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch experience very much, and will go back with friends to sample some more good stuff from their large selection of wursts and schnitzels. I'll update my review after that.

I am very happy that we now have two places in Vegas, where we can get some good genuine German cuisine. Dita's is a fast food place where its German dishes are good but limited to only bratwurst, $4 and currywurst, $6. Café Berlin, on the other hand, is a very nice family restaurant/café, which offers a good selection of wursts and schnitzels (at much higher prices, of course), as well as German beer and wine! So, take your pick to suit your mood of the moment.

A few KIND NOTES to Café Berlin management:

1. A WISH:
 - PLEASE start having ""Happy Hour"" soon with small sampler plates, over German ""draft"" beers? Well, I said it was a WISH!

2. MINOR CRTICISM:
- The mustard bottle with my bratwurst order was almost empty, DIFFICULT to squeeze anything out. I think a good restaurant needs to pay more attention to details like that.

- The lady owner gave some holiday cookies at the end of our meals - a very nice touch for the holidays! So I even ordered coffee for that. But, the owner never did ask if I needed a coffee refill (- the coffee is listed as ""bottomless"" on the menu). Perhaps, the owner really did not normally wait on tables. She did it that day was possibly ONLY BECAUSE her regular waitress was NOT on duty?
- Yes, I know those are very minor stuff, but minor stuff like those could sometimes put customers off. If the restaurant do it right, such as offering customers coffee refills and asking how the meals are, it will make customers feel welcome and special.

I've eaten here a few times and have absolutely no complaints (other than the fact that they are no longer offering a few items that look very tasty). The staff is friendly, courteous, and accommodating. As far as the food, I can personally vouch for, and heartily recommend, the Bier Bratwurst and the Wiener- and Zigeunerschnitzel (pan friend pork cutlets, the latter served with sautéed peppers and onions). The Currywurst (bratwurst served with a curry ketchup) tastes just like it did from the street vendors of Mainz when I lived there and having it again brought back memories of stumbling into the late-Imbiss for one with Pommes after being shooed out of some Kneipe at 3.00 in the morning. 

And always get the strudel...it's made fresh daily and it's delicious.

As far as the decor goes, it is a little spartan at the time of this writing. But one gets the impression when eating there that it is a work in progress and they are slowly putting together the restaurant a little at a time. When they do get all the pieces in place, their liquor license comes through, and the taps installed, Cafe Berlin (already a great spot) is going to be a real neighborhood gem.

We asked for the gravy on the side.  The schnitzels were dry but still tasty, last time the cheese was oozing out.  

They didn't send any gravy.  Seems like a trivial issue, right? Well when you get containers of food that would typically have gravy and you've paid over $100 for delivery it's disappointing.  I get mistakes happen.  We called and ""reported"" it to the restaurant.  The woman on the phone was less than friendly and absolutely not empathetic at all.  Bread dumplings with no gravy and dry spatetzel is typical she said.  Well I disagree as the first time we ordered, gravy was sent.  It's like a staple.  Do you eat French fries without ketchup?? What's worse, she blamed the delivery driver!?  Not sure what I expected the woman to do as we lived far enough from the restaurant but a simple, ""I am so sorry"" would have been nice.

The bratwurst was juicy and savory, the red cabbage was bright and acidic, and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned and added a crunch to the dish. I loved putting it all together and eating it in one bite. Really fantastic. 

I was worried that one sausage was not going to cut it, but I managed to finish the plate. I have a tendency to eat half my food in most places though. So, if you tend to eat more, I recommend spending the extra cash and getting a 2nd sausage.

The waitress was really fast and the food came out hot and quick- but my taters had bacon in them. I had no idea they would, and when I asked for a new plate sans bacon she took it back and gave me a new one. YAY! The sides do not say what they are clearly, so ask just in case.

The Spaetzl was so yummy and fresh, and very good with the cheese (you can get it with meatless sauce as well, but cheese is better!) My friend devoured her plate, including the sauerkraut which she hated as a kid.

There's really not much more to add that hasn't been said in this listing... it's a hole in the wall next to a gas station strip mall-ish place, cool pipe wall lighting, and standard cafeteria style seats and tables--in other words, no frills.  We ordered from the dinner menu, and got the ""works"" good enough for two people.  The food, as expected, is good, salty and flavorful.  The order to share came with a couple of schnitzel, sausages, and a type of pork burger patties, all laid on top of purple cabbage, sauerkraut, and mashed potato.  We also ordered a plate of schnitzel for a third person in our party.
What struck me as rather interesting is that everything on the platter could have easily been 'replicated' by buying sausages, meat patties, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and frozen ready-made schnitzel from a reputable grocery store.  Nothing really special particularly since the price for this platter was a whopping $44.  So overall, dinner, sodas and tip for the three of us came out to about $85!   
Don't get me wrong, the service was excellent, and food was good and as authentic as German food can get.  However, given the spartan hole-in-the-wall ambiance and the type of food served, paying close to $30/pp for a couple sausages, meat patties and fried meat seemed a little steep.

Man oh man was this fantastic.  The cutlets were big and very juicy.  The spaetzle was excellent too.    

We also got the ""Wurstplatte"" which was a sausage sampler that came with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut consisting of two of each of their 3 homemade sausages.  Interestingly enough, my favorite was my wife's least fave.  I really enjoyed the ""bockwurst"" which was their white sausage flavor the best, she preferred the beer bratwurst.  No problem then..more for me!  

The apple streudel on display looked damn good so we got one of those too.  I really liked the doughyness of it.  

I am holding out on 5 stars til they get a liquor license and I can guzzle some steins of beer with their delicious food.  Anybody out there in Yelpworld got some pull?  The owner said she's been waiting for 9 months already.  

They also have a dinner buffet the first Saturday of every month.  Count on us being there Dec 1st!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,17,11,4,h3VU9e9iIyBJ02UJRJaHAQ

Being from Germany, I have a deep love for German food that makes me feel like I am in my Oma's kitchen again. My boyfriend and I have been looking for a place that offers such food so when his boss suggested Cafe Berlin, we had to give it a try. I was absolutely blown away by the authenticity of the food here. You can hear the cooks speaking German in the kitchen and I was able to hold conversation in German  with our waitress who is also from Berlin. 

I ordered the Sauerbraten and I can honestly say (having eaten that very same dish in Berlin only 2 weeks prior to coming here) that it was the BEST Sauerbraten I have ever had in my life. It was tender, slightly zesty, and bursting with rich flavor. I felt downright emotional while eating my food here and when I thought it couldn't get any better, our really sweet waitress (I wish I could remember her name!) gave us her own homemade Apfelstrudel to go with vanilla dipping sauce.

After eating here, there is no way is this place a nearly 5 star German restaurant. Please note that the bulk of stellar reviews come from people who say they have never had German food prior to this meal.

Brian P. & I came here for our weekly date night on 1/3/15. It was a big surprise for me because Brian knew how much I wanted to try it despite living on the opposite side of town now. We figured the reviews, plus the much hyped once a month buffet would surely be worth the long drive and steep price. We were disappointed.

The best way to describe the food is like this - if you were going over to your German friend's house for dinner but their mom toned the food down to try to appeal to what she thinks is your American tastes. She also decided to use a bunch of premade stuff because she didn't want to waste the good stuff on her kid's school friend.

The buffet included: 
*Marinated cucumbers - a bit on the bland side. Not too tangy or seasoned. 
*German potato salad - decent but not as tangy or hot (spicy) as I prefer.
*Mashed potatoes - fancy looking but tasted like premade potatoes from the grocery store.
* Spätzle - Good. Possibly coated in margarine rather than butter.
*Sauerkraut - decent.
*Rotkhol - decent.
*Roasted chicken - very good but just regular roasted chicken.
*Peas & Carrots - straight up frozen, from a bag, peas and carrot cubes. Did not try.
*Assorted sausages - what types they were was unlisted. Did not enjoy.
*Pork Schnitzel - very thin and crispy, but the highlight of the meal.
*Frikadellen - reminds me of the hamburgers my parents made when I was young that I hated. Did not enjoy.
*Brown gravy - OK
*Mushroom gravy - OK, tasted like thickened, canned soup.
*Paprika gravy - looks gross because of vegetable bits but tastes delicious.
*Assorted packaged mini desserts from the store such as cupcakes and those little doughnuts that come in powdered, waxy chocolate or toasted coconut.

For $22.99 per person, I expect more than prepackaged desserts, frozen vegetable medley and the cheapest items that I have or can make (sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, ground beef patties.) I made spätzel daily as my after school meal in middle school. Parents make better cabbage dishes and cucumber salad at home. For that price and as much hype, I shouldn't say ""if I had to choose, I'd just eat a plate of the sides.""

While the staff was friendly and the kitchen looked exceptionally clean from the register, for that price, go enjoy AYCE sushi or meat heavy Korean BBQ and save German food for your make-at-home meal.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,8,2,2,a3z-FJsIHb38De3ReQR21g

I ate the pretzel with cheese, the kid's schnitzel, and the apple strudel. All DELICIOUS!

The pretzel was crisp on the outside and so soft on the inside -- perfection. It was served with cheese on the side, and let me tell you! This was not your average velveeta or nacho cheese. They have chunks of butter mixed I to the cheese, and it is topped with red onion and green onion and a slice of radish. So good and fancy, just how I love it.

I ordered the kid's schnitzel because we had the pretzel as an appetizer and I wasn't extremely hungry. This was a good portion! My mom ordered an adult portion of schnitzel and while my meal came with one piece, hers came with two. So my point is that my meal wasn't too tiny at all. Also, the kid's schnitzel is usually made with pork, but I asked for chicken instead and they were kindly accommodating. They told me that all meals are made to order and it isn't a problem to specialize and order. My crispy schnitzel was served with tasty fries, which I used to finish off the extra cheese from the pretzel, haha.

Oh my goodness, the apple strudel was just lovely! It was served with whipped cream and vanilla sauce. Each of these components made for a beautiful dessert and such a wonderful finish to my dinner.

OK, Ok, They're not ""that"" traditional, but they are from Germany, and they know what the Old Country food should taste like.

The cafe is located behind a Popeye's and Arco gas station. We stopped by on the Tuesday after Memorial Day for lunch.  The last time we had ""German"" food in Vegas was at the touristy Hofbrauhaus, and we were disappointed.  I am pleased to say that this visit to Cafe Berlin was 1000% better.

When you walk in, the place isn't fancy. It's a simple cafe with German products and posters on the ceiling and wall.  What it lacks in decor, the place makes up with good food.  I had the Jaeger schnitzel, while Stephen had the Rahm schitzel, both served with spaetzle, a dumpling type pasta, while mom had the Rouladen, served with red cabbage and bread dumpling.

The food is made to order, and you can hear the cook pounding the pork to make the schnitzel. When the food arrived, few words were spoken while we ate, and the words spoken were ""here, try some of mine"".  

The Scnitzel was delicious.  Perfectly fried outside, and covered in delicious gravy.  The big hit was the Rouladen.  The Rouladen is a beef roll (think flank steak) with bacon, onions and pickles, then rolled, cooked, and covered in gravy.  This was served with a dumpling about the size of a huge golf ball, and a serving of warm red cabbage.  This was a real traditional German meal.  Very German.

Our German adventure didn't end here, as mom ordered the apple strudel and Stephen had the German Chocolate Cherry cake.  Both desserts were not overly sweet, Between the 2 desserts, I did prefer the strudel more. The warm apple and flaky pastry crust, dipped in the vanilla sauce was so good.

Lunch for 3, along with 2 sodas, 2 beers, coffee, and dessert came to $80-something. Perhaps a little pricey since we splurged, but it was probably the highlight of our Vegas jaunt.

Mom liked it, and that's the biggest critic IMHO.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,9,5,5,zGTm1taoEoAeRjWd1H7zFg

HOLY SMOKES. I love vegas and it's amazing food scene but how did this place get here (and how does it not have thousands upon thousands of reviews??). Tucked away on the corner of Sunset and Decatur, I'd have never found this place without my handy yelp (and googlemap) app.

But the food is so good. I guess they've been around for a while now, which says something about the food in and of itself since vegas has such high turnover for restaurants.

Anyway, to business.. 

Came here on a random weekday with my uncle. Dinner menu is pretty extensive and we stuck with the classics: potato pancakes to start, jaeger schnitzel with spaetzle (on the recommendation of our super sweet waitress) and the bier brat.

He ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and I got the spaetzle with mushroom sauce.  Turns out, they're exactly the same dish except his has the schnitzel.  I wish I had known that.  His schnitzel was perfectly cooked chicken breast.  I don't like white meat, and this is one of the few times that I can say I've ever enjoyed it.  The spaetzle was of the longer variety, and they did pan fry it before adding the gravy.  The gravy was a bit salty and too heavy.  

Service was friendly, and one of the ladies there even let me try their cheese sauce that usually comes with the pretzel.  If you like your soft pretzel light and airy, you should def order it here, b/c the cheese sauce was incredible.  I could eat a shoe with that sauce.

5915799,2013-11-27,10,PyrcymoNDAJDm_Zn9yl-7A,"I've had my eye on Cafe Berlin for a hot minute. Always telling myself I was going to go but I wanted to give it some time. This location has changed hands and restaurants many, many times and if Cafe Berlin was not going to last - well, I didn't want to waste my time. But a year and half later, it's still here so it was time to try the place.

Let me start with my only complaint of this place - WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG TO COME HERE!?

My memories of Germany consist of a few different things: Good Times, Good Food, Good Wine and Good Beer. Living in Germany I have the luxury of having excellent German food. Those imbiss stands though. Delicious Brats, Pomme Frites with mayo, schnitzel that would rock your socks off. After leaving Germany, I just knew that I would never have German food that good again.

Well my friends, Cafe Berlin has the most amazing Jaeger Schnitzel. It is perfectly fried with the a very nice, light & crunchy breading. It is topped with the most delicious cream sauce with mushrooms. The size of the jaeger schnitzel was slighter smaller than something you would find in Germany but in the end it was the perfect serving and I was satisfied. The spaetzle was seasoned very well and soft and pillowy. 

I also ordered a side salad with German dressing. Amazing. The salad itself was nothing special but the dressing was made perfectly. Not too oily, not too much sugar, not too much vinegar. I asked for it on the side so I could dress my salad myself and I think this is key. 

Last but not least, if in a German restaurant you have to have a pretzel. There is just something about a German pretzel that I love. I remember walking to the bus stop in the morning when I lived in Germany and always stopping by the bakeries to get me a warm pretzel bun. The pretzel here reminded me so much of that. It was hot, warm and soft. Served with a cheese spread. The pretzel came out so soft and warm that I couldn't wait to eat it and alas, no picture. 

I left Cafe Berlin with a very happy belly. I remember just being happy overall after eating there. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I will have to visit a couple more times before I can do that. But if you want a great schnitzel, do your belly a favor and get over here today.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,22,16,4,iDCfkqRn2nYM4Se8yKIf-Q

Cafe Berlin is was smaller and more intimate. I like it that it's not very loud. The lady who seated us and was serving us was very friendly and helped us to choose from the menus because we are not experts in German food. 
The thing which I liked the most is that there is a screen on the wall which shows almost all staple dishes they have on the menu. It made our life so easy! 
The food was amazing and reasonably priced! I literally now want to try everything on the menu.",wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,0,0,5,EW4b1vIWiQmO289e_NJv9Q

Once a month pork shank on the last Saturday each month, wife loved it. I had the Gulasch Stew and was paprika heaven. The apple strudel was a perfect desert......and the authentic beers!",9l_WfBzsM1vv53oxsrvXzA,0,0,4,b-eme16xa8BRBUVwHzyhTg

We ordered in advance, since we were crunched for time and had a rather large group. Our food was ready when we arrived. We had a pretty large party and the the staff was able to accommodate us nicely. I opted for the schnitzel sandwich and we all shared some large baskets of fries. 

The food was good. I have had German food on a number of occasions over the years, but I am far from experienced with the cuisine. The bread was good, although a little doughier than I prefer. I enjoyed the schnitzel quite a bit. It was juicy and moist, which is important. I wasn't crazy that it just came with lettuce and mayonnaise. I guess I was hoping for something a little more flavorful. The fries were disappointing and bland, so I don't see myself ordering these again. 

We also tried the apple strudel, which was tasty and had a great texture. 

Service was on point and I look forward to trying this place again for a little more of their more traditional dishes. Their dinners and other lunch options look promising.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,8,3,AfCec9aP5JSz4Bx13TDpOw

Best German food I've had since...well, since I was in Berlin.  I had the Wurstplatte, which includes 3 large sausages (Bier Bratwurst, Knockwurst, and Bockwurst), mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut.  My girlfriend had Jaeger Schnitzel, where they kindly substituted chicken for pork (the owner was very considerate).  Both tasted incredible and rich.  It's a very fulfilling meal. And of course everything washes down nicely with German beer.",BrXvHCjzVyQPlW-LnchcLA,1,1,5,O-fbO4W4-w27_JJr-h6mXw
