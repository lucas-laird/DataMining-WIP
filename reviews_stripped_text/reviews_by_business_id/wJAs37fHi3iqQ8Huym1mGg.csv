Can also order from cocktail waitresses. Great for a sports book all day session.,7DH3yzfvsqIXSa3vQUUpWw,2,0,5,hyXeN4e-x2xr3nSKbvePzA

We were looking for something tasty and not so hoity toity place when we found the eatery.  The BF was in the mood for philly cheese steak and voila! They do serve it.  The sandwich is good for 2 people and it comes with good fries.  When you buy a drink, do they offer 1 free refill but be wary what time it is.  I guess we got there close to closing time.  The lady told us about the free refill, but she didn't mention it to us that they were getting ready to close.  

By the time I finished the drink and went back up, she said ""Sorry we're closed!!!"" and  I was like ""I just wanted to get a refill"" and she said no.  So the BF goes up to her and ask her for water and she said no, that they have already cleaned everything and there's no more fluids in the soda machine.  BIG BUMMER! I wished she would've told us in the beginning =(

The price range for the food could be like $8.50 for a chilli hotdog to less than $18 for a nice salad.  They also have small tables that you bring your food to or you can sit  and eat at the leather chairs if you wanted to watch the sports game.",oY4NZbBXAw4GHgI9GmHIQg,1,0,3,isI0eTmTexe6fnhc5YqbIA
985025,2012-11-28,0,wJAs37fHi3iqQ8Huym1mGg,We went to this Sports book not knowing what to expect since I read reviews on this being overly priced and not that good. Well to our surprise it was super yummy. We ordered a turkey sandwich and it came with french fries. The turkey sandwich was so yummy and with a lot of turkey! Totally worth it! I recommend this place for fast and normal food on the strip! Cant beat a good sandwich/food and great place to watch sports.,sS902y0Do8J5qAiJreUJ8w,0,0,4,1pAYWqESyi526dhfSx3kJA

The turkey club sandwich for $11 was stacked high and the fries were tasty.

1625096,2014-07-17,0,wJAs37fHi3iqQ8Huym1mGg,"Pleasantly surprised by this out of the way stand. Food prices were pretty good - we got a burger and chicken fingers, and found the portion sizes to be generous. The fries were good, as many other reviewers have mentioned.

Since it's in the Sports Book, nobody under 21 can eat here. They do offer takeout though. Their menu is probably among the more kid-friendly of the restaurants. We had a food & beverage credit with the room and this was also one of the only places open later at night.

Service is somewhat slow so they lose a star. Beverage/dessert prices seem out of proportion compared to the reasonable food prices.",NCTMBC_fD9qzoOnY0ZQx9Q,0,0,4,07Yc79TjBlsS3kQ-2b0GoA

The food is actually really good.  The fries were perfect.  As long as you get there before the rush, your order comes our pretty quickly.  Since it's in the sports book, be prepared for a rowdy bunch.",j30EgFmz_aia6lY2iKI-gg,2,2,4,vslRmjR0Ci1D-BCWx7hclQ

We were looking for a bar we could gamble at, and this is one in Mandalay Bay that has machines at the bar. Drinks are free if you're gambling. Lots of tables and waitress service at the tables. Food looked good/fattening sports bar food. Ain't nothing wrong with that.

The World Series is going on right now so that was on all the TVs. Customer service at the bar was great. They had beer, wines and hard liquors. The bartenders are prompt to refill drinks and polite.",38dPWgd8DRM-I5x4Qr6Fsw,0,0,5,O_yHfr3zbVrCKcHeQso7-A

Positive:
- staff is friendly enough

Cons:
- poor menu selection 
- food is not cooked as ordered
- payment systems are either broken, slow or both
- staff not knowledgeable 

I won't be back, definitely wouldn't recommend.",Yx6YF_1cNZkvFf3GhZspOQ,0,0,2,fhhaTYDeACmZyhu0x4EgtQ

2339995,2013-10-07,0,wJAs37fHi3iqQ8Huym1mGg,Decent food but it takes FOREVER to  get it especially when crowded.  It may not look crowded but be careful.  You order and pay and then you realize there are 50 orders in front of you.  And you can't cancel the order. They should tell you that it will be awhile before you order.  I will not return.,QyX-l1rvGlkSL1c6RIHV6Q,0,0,2,6rSNibhiq-9EudHIVxLRCA

Located just off the sports booking area it is a hidden gem. Service was friendly and quick and although it is more cafeteria style than a sit down restaurant, IT ROCKED!

The turkey club is delicious. It is piled high with turkey and bacon. The burgers are great and you get mounds of french fries. 
The people working at the grill are always super friendly too. This place is the best hidden spot at Mandalay Bay if you want great food without the hassle of a restaurant.",YaI3Rm2uF-TjE2ouZEOO2A,0,0,5,_GLOXMZh6v1JWwo60u7mIA

If you are looking for selection, avoid it. You should probably avoid anything that looks like a snack bar if you want a huge selection.

The offer a mix of pub and deli finger food. Burgers, sandwiches, etc. 

Its a much better burger than the fast food alternatives in the casinos, and when you add the casino premium to the fast food price, the Sports Book Grill is a much better decision, and far less regrettable later on in the day....If you know what I mean.",43ifr6xOE2zpnBrqHS-E2A,1,0,4,Sm8NoTZMdgKEG7Gr6yxc3g
