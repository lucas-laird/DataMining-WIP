11530,2009-10-27,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Three of us dined at Raku late on a Saturday night.  We called ahead and were told that we would have to wait for a table.  Upon arrival, this very small and intimate restaurant was about 1/3 empty so we got a table right away.

We ordered light since it was our ""midnight snack."" We had the Raku's Tofu which was the most amazing tofu I've ever had; Blue Fin Tuna, also wondeful; delicious Pork Belly; and lobster which was really nice but the small portion left me wanting more.  For the lobster, what's not serverd is used to make the best miso soup that I've ever had.

The down side was the service.  If I was on a first date, this would have been great but, I wasn't so, for such a small place, the service was awful.  Everytime we needed something, we had difficulty flagging the waitress (did I mention this is a small place?) and twice beer was ordered and it never came.  The fact that we were not in a hurry made it not such a big deal for us, but it's worth noting.

I felt it was on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for and we sure did have a fantastic midnight snack.",_D0fpoWGQt3_-FGYLWuntg,1,1,4,5VGkoOEJ9R1He9kaZ-MFfA
15547,2011-04-01,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"The food and drinks are great, but the reason I'm giving Raku five stars is because of the outstanding service. We had a reservation for three at 7PM on a Thursday. (Be prepared to call numerous times to get a reservation). Our waitress was courteous, prompt, and had tons of recommendations. We asked many questions about the sake and started with the monthly sake sampler. We liked some of the sake better than others, so she made us a different sampler based on our preferences. That's service! The food was a little slow coming out at the beginning, but we had tons of sake to drink, so we were happy. After we started getting dishes, service was steady.

The strip mall exterior is ugly, but the interior is elegantly understated. The bathroom also has one of those Japanese toilets with tons of features, although I didn't try any of them. 

There are little touches that really make the experience special. One very cool feature is that the chopsticks are sitting on the used charcoal pieces from the grill. We were debating what they were for most of the night, so this was a fun surprise. There are also some interesting condiments on the side. They offer a green tea salt, a soy sauce, a chili powder, and a chili oil. I'm sure someone's posted a pic of them in the 400+ pics of Raku on Yelp.

In terms of the food, we liked the chicken wing, Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon, fried homemade tofu in hot broth, pork belly (nightly special), and hirame (nightly special). The tofu in hot broth is amazing, and I loved the broth and fish eggs popping in my mouth. The 2 specials, the pork belly and hirame, were both really good. The hirame came with a yuzu dipping sauce and the fish's liver, which was a surprise. The fish does take a while to prep though.

We also tried the Kurobuta pork cheek, Raku's tofu, tsukune-grilled ground chicken, and green hot chili pepper, which we didn't like as much, but were definitely not bad either. With the tsukune, I've figured out that I don't really like shiso, so that's why it wasn't one of my favorites. 

Unfortunately, they were out of of the chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin and the potato with corn when we were there. Next time!",SgYDjNCecPidsRB_su5-tw,1,1,5,TOLnUBxOhdrHUTIhSso5hQ

There were several empty tables available and we wanted to be moved to a better location.  We could not get the attention of the waitress/hostess.

Everyone has already commented on how this is located in some obscure, dark corner of a strip mall so i'll skip onto the juicy stuff.

So, the first negative thing I have to note is that my body went through an MSG overload after we left the restaurant. My bf and I must have been on the brink of dehydration for hours after the meal (no thanks to the casinos- there are ZERO water fountains on the strip), but judging from the volume of food we had & the inescapable dashi seasoning in japanese food, that sounds about right. We had a FEAST. And all for ~$60 for 2. 

Highlights: 
Agedashi tofu- fried on the outside for some bite and texture, so buttery soft on the inside, sitting in dashi broth. 

Kobe beef tendon- a thousand times yes! this was our favorite. the tendon was fresh and just melts in your mouth. 

Kurobuta pork cheek

Chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin- salted, crispy skin + juicy morsel of chicken. 

Fluffy cheesecake- ok, the description is really lacking here. its really a mousse of cheesecake sitting on top of a thin layer of very finely cubed fruit! and on top of a dark chocolate? cookie crust, garnished with some raspberries, a little raspberry sauce, and green tea powder. it was so light and refreshing, i savored every single bite. 

Skip: 
Poached egg w/sea urchin & salmon roe- the description fails to say it basically sits in a mucous-y okra broth. 

Potato corn- i get the novelty but once you get over wondering how this came to be, you realize youre getting ripped for a small morsel of bland veggies. 

Butter sautéed scallop with soy sauce- salty, small, a smidgen overcooked, $7.00. i mean, with that price you could buy TWO orders of the beef tendon...

Tips: 
- Call for reservations. A party of 4 was turned away in the beginning of the night and was told that it was completely booked for the night. It was a TUESDAY so yeah, plan ahead. 
- The bathroom's cute. It's got a cute forest theme going on. 

Very very memorable meal. I have tons of pictures (not sure how to upload) but I'm already moving on to my next procrastination activity- Dexter.",hpbxmAJyTip-O7XyYLGWhQ,3,1,4,QTDGibbxvKZEbquLRPBGPQ
29041,2010-05-27,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"If you've got some cash to burn, do it at Raku. I'd never been to a restaurant that serves tiny portions at regular-meal prices before, but apparently they're on to something here.

I went one Friday night with my girlfriend and Matt C, and after perusing the menu long enough to surely annoy the incredibly nice waitress, we ordered a smattering of different items, positive that we'd end up with at least a couple good ones.

I was skeptical that the food would live up to its prices, but once it arrived I understood. The chefs at Raku know what's up. Let me put it this way: I absolutely despise tomatoes. As in, if you starve me for a week and then put a tomato in front of me, I'll throw it in your face. The bacon-wrapped tomatoes at Raku, however, were one of the most delicious pieces of food I've had in months. Of course, it's hard to not love something that's wrapped in bacon, but getting me to like a dish that is made primarily with tomatoes is no small feat.

The only real complaint I have about Raku is the prohibitively-high prices on their items. I complain about high prices on food, so expect to see that a lot if you read my reviews. If I leave a place thinking ""I could have gotten more food for a quarter of that price"" then I probably just paid way too much for a meal. Raku is one of the few places where I believe the high price is justified, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point it out.

Raku is the kind of restaurant people who are really into food eat at. Tiny portions and high prices, but incredibly, mind-bendingly delicious. If you consider yourself a ""foodie"" or you really enjoy Japanese food, I can't recommend Raku enough.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,1,1,5,Ief6rZ7udpyRD6zsfd43Zw

The small menu comprises a handful of small cold and hot dishes along with some grilled items. Very small for an izakaya, but there is good reason.  The focus is more on the quality of the ingredients used, which 

To start, I had the house made tofu and poached egg with ikura and uni.  The tofu was  purely transcendent.  It's creamy, dense, and when paired with their house brewed soy sauce, out of this world.  The three way of eggs was really interesting.  Our waiter was kind enough to show us how to eat these dishes.

In addition to the regular menu, they also had a selection of sashimi.  When we ordered the Japanese amberjack, we had pieces from the belly and the loin, showing the different tastes and textures of the fish.

The highlight of the night was the juicy deep fried chicken.  The chicken was so succulent that I nearly cried. There was also some spinach salad on the bottom to balance out the richness.

I knew something was wrong with the kitchen because the waiter started off the night saying please be patient with the kitchen. But waiting for 1 hour for food with a hungry 13 month old who almost has to go to bed is not acceptable. Even worse, they couldn't give me an estimated time for when our first dish would arrive.

50426,2011-07-04,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,Raku is a unique Japanese restaurant in Vegas. Food is innovative and Raku certainly backs up that claim with quality and flair. We ordered 15 dishes but the ones that really stood out for me were the fried agedashi tofu and the poached egg in green tea soba as well as the one with sea urchin and salmon roe. I'm sucker for eggs but the poached egg here at Raku is simply amazing.

You wonder why more cheesecakes, which are usually like bricks, not more like this.

85393,2012-04-29,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Just came back from Vegas and tried this place out based on Yelp reviews and a co-worker's recommendation.  It was OK but I guess from the reviews, I was expecting more.

I was looking forward to trying out the a la carte dishes based on their website but we had a party of six people and apparently this put us in the prix fixe category.  So for a fixed priced of $50, $60 or $70 per person we would get a certain number of courses.  I chose the $60 per person menu which included 10 courses.  I don't remember seeing this information on their website but I think customers should know this before going in.

They also took my credit card to 1) charge me if we did not keep the reservation or 2) charge me for the full 6 people even if less than 6 people showed up.  Another piece of helpful info.

My impression of this place should have been about the food however I came away with two things.  The restaurant photo on their website captures a completely different atmosphere than the actual restaurant.  Kudos to the photographer.  And we didn't have any choice of what the 10 courses were going to be.  So we had no idea what we were getting.  The group I was with liked being surprised with each course but I didn't.  We had to order a couple of a la carte items outside of the prix fixe menu just so I could try the dishes I was looking forward to in the first place.

We had chicken thigh (boring), a mushroom special (too salty and chewy - and overpriced), a whole fish special that was off (smelly fish - really?), and yam and other dishes that were salty and not memorable.

107567,2014-09-14,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"After being disappointed with Carnevino and resigned to Bouchon, possibly that my expectations for the food town that is Las Vegas were a wee bit too high. It casted doubts on my Joel Robuchon, which is not something I will readily admit, considering it's a 3-Michelin star place, and one of his only restaurants in the States. But I did, because I knew I needed to choose between his place at the MGM Grand, or Raku, the sushi place off strip that Anthony Bourdain dinedwith Penn Jilette on Parts Unknown. 

So Raku is the choice I made - a sushi house that does take reservations, but not for the bar - a sushi house that is dark and small, with some hidden doors that I can only assume meant deliciousness.

We sat in the back for around 10 minutes before being seated at the sushi bar - the bar one of the more unusual ones I've seen. There is no glass case of already sliced fish, a display to choice from, but instead a display behind them like a fish market - whole fish that were recently purchased, staring at us while we're served.

They were polite until the hostess and one of the chefs realized that while I was no expert or aficionado, I wasn't an amateur either. After that, they were curious and attentive. They serve not one single roll - which was something I delighted in - so I ordered omakase. Mr. V choose small a la carte meals.

He ordered a range of dishes that both swim on this earth and walk its hard grounds.

-One scallop dish that was seared very softly served in its own shell, with a mixture of soy sauce, ponzu, and scallions.  
-Mushroom wrapped in bacon - not very Japanese like, except for the ponzu basted on the mushroom tops, and devoured nonetheless.
-Kobe beef skewers in a dark, sticky sweet plum sauce, each bit just a morsel bigger than a bite, hot and soft, like butter in your mouth.
-Foie gras over house made tofu, swimming in a miso-like broth, topped with impossibly thin sliced scallions and sea salt.
-Pork short ribs that were more than just ala carte - piping hot, sticky salty sweet sauce that pooled around the bones after eaten, falling off after just one tender nibble.
 
His were delicious.

Mine are more difficult to remember, as when ordering omakase, they just keep bringing out food and happiness.

-Housemade tofu that was simply something I had never had before, prepared as it was. Raku is known for it, so it makes sense that a large slice of the buttery soft white tofu was served - with ginger, fish flakes, scallions, sea salt, and soy sauce for dipping. I wanted to use my fingers, but alas, kept to the sticks.
-Tuna, salmon, and kanpachi sashimi with the customary bits of ginger (not touching), radish, and seaweed tucked neatly under each of the trios laid out. Each piece was cold and had the nice meaty-fatty texture that one wants of sashimi from their chef.
-Grilled chicken skewers basted with a ponzu/soy sauce mixture that brought out the fatty bits of charred skin.
-Kobe beef skewers that I nibbled on and shared with Mr. V.
-Foie gras skewers, which I'm such are a luxury in itself, as how am I supposed to eat them when they are so soft and gelatinous? Dipped in a warm and sticky soy sauce, they were surely one of the richest foods I'd ever had - as it was my first time with foie gras.
-Kanpachi sashimi order (which was not omakase, but my own separate order - yes, I can eat that much) - it was of last meal caliber, and something I could've easily eaten every day. Soft, never chewy, cool to the touch, just the right about of fatty white lines, melting as only fresh fish could.
-Ikura served over rice - Ikura, singlehandedly one of my favorite foods as well - beautifully round salmon eggs that held so much saltwater that they were little bursts of ocean with every bite.
-Cheesecake fluff with a sliver of plum sauce, raspberry sauce, and a cross between chocolate and hazelnut crumbles.

This was the meal I was looking for when I came to Vegas, and I'm not at all sorry I had to go off strip in order to get it. We were there from opening, which was 6pm to around 8:30pm.

110786,2012-12-30,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"This restaurant was on my must hit list in Las Vegas.  My husband did the reservation two weeks ago.  We sent two kids to Kids Quest in Sunset Station and prepared to have a feast there.  We were told by the restaurant that if we didn't  go there right at the reservation time, seats won't be reserved for us and also that we would only have an hour and half to eat.   We came in the restaurant right on our reservation time 6:30 P.M.  We looked at the menu and ordered our food.  Our first course came 5 minutes later.  Homemade tofu was very good.  The texture was almost like light cheese cake.  We were pretty happy.  
Then after that, everything went weird.  We sat there for half an hour and nothing else came out.  My husband started to ask what was going on.  We asked 3 waitresses and they all said  they would go back and checked in the kitchen for us.  But we just saw them ran around and chatted with each other but without seeing any food coming out for us afterwards.  Finally when we waited 45 minutes without any food being served, my husband asked the manager out and talked to her seriously about the extremely slow service.  She apologized and promised to check and have food come out quickly.  Then she came back 5 minutes later and said all our food was on the grill now.  OK, I wondered where our order had been before.  Then in another 15 minutes, all our food came out.  We had to rush to eat since we had to go pick up our kids at Kids Quest due to Nevada kids care time limitation.  We sat there gulping our food down.  I did notice the apple marinated lamb chop was still a bit raw at the part connecting the bone.  But I didn't mind too much at the time.  We left there with a $123 bill plus 15% tip.  Although we had bad service experience, I didn't want to blame too much on the waitress, especially during Christmas time.   
That night went on OK and we were prepared to leave Las Vegas the next day.  I woke up next morning and felt very uncomfortable.  I started vomiting and became very weak.  I drank some water and vomited again.  Then my husband woke up and he had bad diarrhea.  In short, we were both sick with bad food poisoning and vomiting and diarrhea continued whole day.  We didn't know exactly which course was the reason for food poisoning but I doubt it was caused by that not fully cooked lamb chop.  You can imagine our pain in the airplane with bad stomach and two young kids.  
No more, no more we will ever go to that restaurant again.

Prior to coming to Las Vegas, I read a very small article on Travel and Leisure magazine about this place.  Since it was up the street from the hotel I am staying, this trip transported me to Japan via a strip mall.  I got in just as it opened and welcomed me ( in japanese) .  Being the first customer there I recognized this is a small place(31 seats). Reservations are a must .  But when you get in, be prepared to be amazed by the food presented at the table ( or bar).  Anything  that you order will astound your taste buds, especially if  you order from the specials menu. Their signature item is the agedashi tofu- tofu made in house with dashi broth, tiny mushrooms, fish eggs and a little hot sauce on rim of the bowl.  This will redefine what tofu should taste like- soft and silky smooth.  The kobe beef skewers were awesome: two skewers, one laced with garlic, the other  in miso.  But the third special item, negi toro, was sublime (toro chopped up fine to a near paste); combined with real wasabi and homemade soy sauce(yes, homemade, not kikkoman). Service was exceptional and very friendly as if you were a long time customer.

136873,2012-03-14,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"We love robata grill, so Raku seemed a must visit on our latest trip to Las Vegas.  

First, the service at Raku was slow.  Not just slow, but mind-numbingly slow.  Our meal lasted three hours, including an inexplicable half hour delay between the first appetizer of fresh tofu and our next course of blue fin tuna sashimi.  Since this was our first visit, I'm not ready to pass judgment.  But in any case, I probably wouldn't recommend you visit Raku if you are on a tight timeline.  But if you are going to provide slow service, you better make sure it is good -- and Raku came through.  Although she steered us to the ""safer"" menu items, our server was friendly, helpful, and, when she was around, attentive.  When she wasn't, we were on our own for large stretches of time, or offered the wrong dish by one of the other servers who consistently confused our table.

However, the food overwhelmed any service issues.  It was, in a word, amazing!  We started with the fresh tofu -- it had the consistency of ricotta but what drove it to the next level were the myriad layers of flavor added by the various condiments.  Although I never thought I would say it about a ""plain"" tofu dish, this is a must have.

The blue fish tuna sashimi special was also very good.  It was fresh and delicious but while we enjoyed it, it probably wasn't even close to the level of the tofu.  Combine that with the near extinction of blue fin tuna and the price, and it probably won't be on our next order.  Same with the sea snail, which was interesting, but not especially flavorful.  And while we are big fans of eel, the unagi teriyaki was not as good as the ones available at other restaurants.

The fried flying fish and agedashi tofu reinvigorated our meal.  Both were excellent. And the accompanying broth was delicious to the last drop.  It typified our experience at Raku, where the multiple layers of texture and flavor combine to create a large complex symphony.  

The grilled skewers were also great.  The tomato with bacon and enoki mushroom with bacon were exactly why we love robata grill.  The only other vegetable we ordered, the asparagus okaki  was also excellent.  The beef outside skirt with garlic was good, the duck with balsamic soy sauce was better, and the foie gras with glazed soy-base sauce was absolutely, melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  The pork cheek was also good, but the pork ear was a little bit to chewy and cartilaginous to be our cup of tea.  Surprisingly, the Tsukune-grilled ground chicken was bland -- a let down compared to the rest of the meal.

We finished off with the green tea creme brulee, which was the perfect dessert.  Not too rich or thick, it was exactly what we needed after the rich skewers we had just eaten.  And it had the same depth of flavors that we had enjoyed in the other dishes.  I also recommend you try the sake flight.  It was interesting and all of the sakes were excellent -- you can order most of them by the glass, as well as by the bottle, if you find one that you like.

Overall, Raku was a great, if lengthy experience.  We will try the Kaiseki meal (and make sure we have a four hours to spare) the next time we visit.",DdDl5vOL00TE3wnorz1o-w,0,0,4,iYf16_TM6W2kjyqcsVGyYw

The food is truly amazing here.  A mix of standard and original dishes, smartly conceived, and expertly prepared with very fresh ingredients.  Every offering is an adventure in flavor and texture.  I've often wondered what it must be like to sit at the judges' table of the original Iron Chef, but I can't imagine it's much better than having a meal at Raku.

Some highlights:

Agedashi Tofu: Creamy and smooth tofu delicately fried and served in a savory broth.  Loved it, and I don't even particularly like tofu.

Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe, with okra and daikon and mushrooms and broth: So much contrast between the different ingredients, and yet it all makes for a great dish.

Steamed foie gras egg custard: Heavenly.

Grilled foie gras: Sinful.

Sashimi salad: Very fresh fish on a bed of greens, lovely dressing, crispy fried onion topping.

Fluffy cheesecake: Beautifully presently, wonderfully light.  A sublime finish.

The wait staff was very welcoming, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  On top of everything else, the portions are relatively large, and the prices are quite affordable for the quality of food.  My wife and I had about 9 different dishes, were totally satisfied, and made it out with a total bill under $100.

The Agedashi tofu was a little strange - instead of cubes, it was one big patty of tofu.  It wasn't crispy (I usually like my Agedashi to be crispy), but the broth was delicious. The ikura don was pretty standard, just ikura over rice, but the quality of the ikura was very good, and there was a lot of it for $10.  The buttered scallops were tasty, but overpriced at $7 per scallop! Don't think I'd get those again. The green tea soba had a great flavor and was cooked very al dente, just how I like it.  The skirt steak with fried garlic was probably my favorite.  The meat was tender and cut up bite-sized, the sauce was absolutely scrumptious, and the garlic slices brought out the flavor of the meat.  My family also ordered the chicken wings, the uni/ikura/poached egg dish, the pork cheek, and the grilled oysters, but I didn't eat any of those, so I can't comment.

The agedashi tofu was delicious. Soft tofu with a good broth that provides the tofy with alot of flavor.  Poached egg with sea urchin was a hit, it includes poached egg, sea urchin, okra, mushrooms, salmon roe, in a broth. Kobe beef filet was tender and the wasabi touch was the right amount of spice to the kobe beef. The chicken teba wing had a good crust and was tender and flavorful.

Be careful of the board the server brings to the table with no prices. They are ""specials"" especially for your wallet...a small sized cooked sea bass filet - $25, and kanpachi sashimi $23. If your willing to pay, i say go for it but don't be surprised when you see your bill at the end. 

I first ordered a refreshing citrusy 750ml bottle of sake for the table - $55 - sweet and delicious. I later found out it has a lower alcohol content too lol. (Probably wouldn't order again; however it was nice to taste and try)

The Kobe beef filet skewers are a must! - $12ea (a little steep but I guess quality over quantity), foie gras custard was delish - $12 , yellowtail carpaccio was decent however nothing different than what you can get at any sushi bar in town - $12, enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon was a pleaser for me however not for my other guests (I personally love mushrooms) - $3, half agedashi tofu was a must try because it was raved as being ""fresh and homemade"" (no disappointment there) - $7.50, scallop w/soy sauce was tender and not over cooked (unfortunately there was only one piece) - $7.00, we decided to try Kobe beef liver sashimi...texture and all were definitely not my cup of tea. At least i can say I've tried it once and only once.

For dessert we ordered fluffy cheesecake (by far my favorite) yum! - $6, green tea creme brûlée and a strawberry sorbet (both were alright) 
End of the meal the bill was - $275 for four plus a 20% tip. 

Overall, it met my high expectations as before, with their ambiance, quality of food. This place is Definitely a hidden Vegas treasure off the strip.",QEt0Dav4bj7lRRdiZ6mNrA,6,4,5,9IbCB7I31F0FzTp2JQ2emA

This is a different experience than most other places. You can eat a lot of small and cheap courses that just tastes amazing. They can make small simple things taste fantastic, like tomatoes or asparagus (both with or without bacon) on a grill.

We did not go with the tasting menu but did choose a lot from the daily specials.
The fish specials, they will sashimi have the fish and you can grill or fry the remaining. 

If you like sea urchin and ikura, you must try the ""Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe"" This was a my favorite.

The raku tofu and agedashi tofu ( made by them) were simple and delicious.

This is a grill house so be sure to try the kobe skewer.

These portions are good for sharing as a couple. Everything was light, balanced and not too heavy so you can order different things and get a good tasting.

341614,2014-09-03,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I was so thrilled to try this place out, but I didn't leave here super pleased. :(

Before I start this review, I must say that I am not a fan of seafood aka raw fish aka fish aka most of the things on the menu. I prefer cooked foods, chicken, vegetables and red meat. So dun, dun dun, I tried the hiyashi chawanushi, agedashi tofu, asparagus okaki, juicy fried chicken, kobe beef filet, kobe beef skirt, grilled duck, and eggplant. 

Hiyashi chawanushi: This dish was a daily special. I believe it was an egg custard with crab and something else on top. Like I said above, I'm not a fan of seafood, and this dish had such a fishy taste to it. I gagged a little after trying it, and I couldn't get rid of the fishy taste it left in my mouth. We left 90% of it left, because the dish itself was overwhelming.

Agedashi tofu: I have to agree with all the other yelpers. The best and most fresh tofu. Get this!

Asparagus okaki: This dish comes with pieces of asparagus breaded with rice cracker. Very delectable. 

Juicy fried chicken: The best dish. Like its name, it was six pieces of extremely mouthwatering chicken on a bed of spinach. The chicken itself was superb. The spinach and the sauce complimented the chicken. I definitely recommend this!

Kobe beef filet with wasabi/kobe beef skirt with garlic: Very nice cuts of kobe beef. I liked the garlic one more, because all I could taste was wasabi and no meat. 

Grilled duck: I can't remember much about the duck except for its tangy aftertaste and chewiness. Bleh, I guess I was expecting something different. Thank goodness they present each table with tea afterwards, because I could not stand the aftertaste.

Eggplant. Grilled eggplant sprinkled with a ton of dried ginger. The eggplant was soft and appetizing, but the ginger ruined it for me. The ginger itself has a strong flavor, and I thought there was just too much ginger on there. I still ate it, but I took off most of the ginger.  

Of the eight dishes, I would only come back for the tofu, asparagus and juicy fried chicken. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but I would not come back here. :c",8u40NmUttgpEpAJr249Fcg,1,0,2,YqSrhU2OOSSo_B0rIqfz4w

I've been to Raku for about three times now and I make it a point to order different items from the menu each time. For me, their most stellar items on the menu are the Kenken Salad, the Foie Gras chawan mushi (egg custard), and the Wagyu Sukiyaki (on special menu). Their grill items were also consistently very good. My friends and I also loved the buttered sautéed hotate (scallops) and the fried ice fish, but those are items you can easily find at other gourmet Japanese restaurant so if you have to plan your meal, I would go for the Kenken salad, the chawan mushi, 2-3 grilled items (we loved the kurobuta pork cheek), and the sukiyaki ($40-50). Be prepared to spend upwards of $50 per person.

The not so nice thing about Raku is their service. They are courteous but not attentive. We had to try and catch the servers' attention several times before being approached. They also didn't run us through their special menu until after I asked if they were still serving their wagyu sukiyaki. Getting a reservation at this place is an absolute nightmare. The receptionist is fond of saying sorry no and does not offer any options (ie. no suggestions of other vacant times nor information on tables that are reserved for walk ins). On one occasion, we arrived 5 minutes late and after making us wait almost 10 mins, the receptionist then told us they couldn't sit us because the next table reservation was in 20mins. Mind you, that was at 6pm, and 2/3rd of the place was still empty. If you want a table at Raku, better call and reserve at least 3-4 days in advance.

I should have called sooner but I was having trouble deciding since there are tons of great restaurants in Vegas. I got a Saturday reservation for 11PM. There were a few snags that I found odd for the price we were paying.
We had a very drunk woman next to us that was really loud and disruptive but the staff seemed to not care. Once she left it was nice, quiet and relaxing. The seating is interesting since the place is small. They have a long bench on one side of the dining room with 3 separate tables pulled up to it. That bench is uncomfortable after about 10 minutes...and we were there for a rather long meal so.. that wasn't great.
The menu didn't seem that straight forward. You order each thing separately but it doesn't state on the menu how much food you get at all. So was I supposed to order all at once or order as we go like a sushi bar? I don't know. My husband just went for ""Chef's choice"" $100 per person and I needed a moment to decide. When the waitress finally came back quite awhile later she brought food for my husband and I told her I'd like the ""Chef's choice"" as well. It seemed to cause an issue since they already planned his meal and started on it. They finally said it was fine and we started receiving food. All the food was really really good. I noticed towards the end of our meal the dishes came out slower and slower as well as the tables around us. Again, the food was good. I did find a couple dishes felt like ""fillers"" and not that special.

I would eat here again. Although next time when making reservation i'd request to not be seated on one of those bench tables.

We sat at the bar and let our waitress take the lead ordering for us after we gave her an idea of our mood. With one-bites on skewers and translucent fresh fish nibbles, the dishes ran the gamut from off the grill to never seen a flame. The saki list, which was practically a tome, also afforded us several options for an evening beverage. 

Menu highlights included a friend chicken on a bed of spinach slightly reminiscent of its Southern cousin but lighter, and a little healthier with the addition of greens; any of the sashimi(the waiter will let you know what's just arrived), and finally, dessert. Green tea creme brulee anyone? An ingenious homage to the classic French dessert with a Japanese twist that resulted in a light flavor with a smooth creamy texture, and finished with a thin crisp of burnt sugar.

I enjoy eating off the strip. 

I have it in my mind that a James Beard nominee has the culinary chops to prepare a very nice meal. 

What I fail to recognize every time I got to a small, local joint is that what separates the great chefs from the good chefs is the ability to monetize their skills through a combination of culinary skill and inspiration and business savvy and the boring, technical aspects of running a restaurant. 

If you watch Top Chef, this is the reason why ""Restaurant Wars"" always exposes the contestants as amateurs who resemble chickens running around with their heads cut off.

This is also why there are so many good chefs out there who can't seem to get their restaurant working right. 

They cook well, brilliantly even, but just don't know how to run a restaurant. 

Dining here was almost a surreal experience.

We had early dinner reservations, and despite a nearly empty restaurant (which isn't all that big) it took several employees several minutes to get our party of two seated. It was kind of a comical process that involved a lot of people scurrying around and talking in their ""inside"" voices. 

Having studied the menu prior, we knew what we wanted, and ordering wasn't too difficult, but receiving the items we ordered turned out to be a bit of a crap shoot.

The tofu, we were told is homemade, and was texturally interesting, but not as rich flavor-wise as other homemade tofus I've eaten.

The robata items, of which there are many, were excellent.

Our favorites were:
- Kobe beef with wasabi
- Duck
- Foie Gras
- Enoki mushroom with bacon

They do have some specials that are not on the menu.. They had a seared tuna appetizer which we ordered, but were not particularly impressed with. It was sesame crusted and something you might see at a PF Chang happy hour. 

We enjoyed the food, but the service was definitely uneven. Wrong items coming out, items we ordered not coming out, items we ordered once coming out twice, you name it, it happened. 

While we were eating the restaurant did fill up, and there were some random walk-ins who came in, looked around, then left, and there was one homeless woman who walked in, asked if it was a sushi bar, was told it was not (though they do have a sushi bar) and she subsequently left.

It's located in a strip mall, so it's kind of an unassuming place.

Maybe not a good spot to impress a date, but the food's good, if she's one of those don't judge a book by its cover types?

Well this place is totally delicious... we had this grilled mushroom with a pinch of salt on top, that's it just that, and it was just delicious. somehow the salt just blends slowly as you chew the mushroom and gives you a hint here and there, just enough to remind you it's not just plain mushroom, it's just masterfully done...

The agedashi tofu, wonderful, home made tofu, one big whole lump, deep fried, in a well balanced broth, and a hit of gojujang on the side of the bowl, nice touch, by far my favorite agedashi...

The pork belly tender in a sauce, just melts in your mouth, it's fatty so if you don't like fatty steer clear.

poached egg with see urchin, just delicate food with soft texture, it's just like the food is caressing your tongue...

The deep fried chicken, is hella crispy, it's breast cut thin then folded onto itself behind the skin then fried till crispy, crispy outside and tender just done inside, hmmm

Pork cheek skewer, succulent, grilled to perfection, has a bit of fat on it, makes it flavorful, the fat also gets a bit crispy which is a nice touch, this one though eat while it's still hot, don't let the fat get cold...

There are specials nightly, the grilled squid is quite fresh and tender and sweet.

However on the second visit, Raku was able to re-invent itself and offer even more delectables and a considerably different tasting menu that wowed my palate even more.

The restaurant is unassuming, located in a strip mall in Chinatown. The decor is minimal with two bathrooms with serious personality. The service is unfussy but genuine and you can tell that they take great care in plating and execution without taking it too seriously. The flavors are clean and emphasis is on using only the best ingredients. All of the components of each dish are well thought out and serve a purpose. The results are nothing short of amazing.

My favorites are as follows:
*Agedashi tofu - homemade tofu melts in your mouth and the broth is heavenly, literally out of this world!
*Juicy Deep Fried Chicken - amazingly juicy chicken wrapped in deep fried chicken skin...need i say more...
*Crispy Asparagus Okaki - the crispy fry on the outside of the asparagus adds the perfect crunch and toasted rice flavor to add incredible depth. Add some green tea salt to bring out the flavors even more
*Dried Tatmi Sardine Salad - ceasar salad kicked up a notch, great briny and cheesy flavor
*Kurobuta Pork Cheek Robata - juicy and great grill flavor from the robata
*Fried Ice Fish - beautifully fried fish served whole with fish nuggets in again, heavenly broth
*Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon Robata - it's wrapped with bacon...need i say more
*Yellowtail Carpaccio - sashimi was incredibly fresh
*Grape Tomatoes Robata - so simple but simply delicious...add the green tea salt and you're going to be impressed and want to try to make it at home
*Salmon Ikura Don - beautifully presented and then served into individual portions. The ikura pops in your mouth to bring the taste of the ocean to the salmon rice.
*Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup - the broth as well as the noodles were amazing
*Eel Don with Gobo - again, served with heavenly broth. The gobo added great depth by bringing a bit of earthy bitterness to balance the salty and sweet.
*Crispy Fried Shrimp - fried little shrimpies, delicious.. 
*Sorbet of the Season - so simple, a strawberry sorbet with condensed milk. The combination makes the sorbet take on a creamy texture and the fruit flavor packs a good punch to end the meal. The kiwi one was delicious as well

The housemade tofu is a revelation! First try it with the special Hokkaido sea salt blend, and then with the shredded bonito and scallions and ginger, with a little bit of the homemade soy sauce drizzled on top. Wow!

We tried dishes from all across the menu, from the asparagus okaki (fried with a crispy panko? crust) to the delicious kobe skewers -- thank you previous reviewer, you were so right about that beef -- to the whole fish prepared two ways. We chose sea bream, a very small, delicately flavored fish. It came sashimi'd first, then the other half of the fish was grilled. Beyond delicious.

My kids are so jealous because Raku had grilled rice balls, a real country-style treat that we used to have all the time when they were children. Yum!

The service and atmosphere were wonderful. We sat in a kaiseiki room, which was an intimate dark wood booth. Clientele ranged from locals (we overheard the staff greeting a regular saying they were worried because he always came in at 9 PM and he was a few minutes late!) to a group of Japanese businessmen to a couple with a young baby. All were treated excellently and all seemed to really enjoy their experience at Raku. We will be back.

No more slow and lazy waitress, no more wrong order.

I went with a friend, and we had the $100 per person menu where they bring you the Chef's choices over 10 courses.

The highlights:
The TOFU!! omg, this is the absolute best item I ate all night. Made in house, as the waitress informed us. Worth the price of admission, and probably the best I've ever had.
The SOY SAUCE!! Again, made in house, and again among the best I've ever had.

The waitstaff: they know their menu inside and out, and take the time to speak with you and answer questions. Our waitress definitely made the meal
better and more enjoyable socially.

Other highlights: 90% of their ingredients are organic, and it was clear that they took great care in choosing the source of their meats.

There was one lowlight: if you don't like the taste of charcoal, I'd advise against the seafood selections such as scallops and crab legs. They are grilled on the charcoal grill, and the shells did taste a bit of the charcoal.

With that being said, I tried about half the items on the menu and here is my personal verdict. I liked the tofu, anyway you go it's ALL GOOD! Hiyashi style, agedofu style, or oyaji dofu, try them all, there all good! Also the kobe beef skewer with wasabi on top, the bomb!!! Also, I      won't eat sashimi unless it's off the boat kine fresh. All of their sashimi was super fresh, how can you do that in the middle of the desert? And how can I forget to mention that the asparagus okaki was super good, culinary magic!! The only gripe that I might have is that the foie gras on the foie gras chawan mushi was a little bit over cooked (chotto katakatta nei), but flavor was super good. I highly recommend this restaurant. I can go on forever, but I felt that each dish was made with ""aijo"" or with heart and love.

I also want to give a shout out to Johnathon the server, my ""hafu"" brother I met in Vegas! You know the deal Johnathon we ""hafu"" stick together. Johnathon explained each dish that was brought to the table, and gave tips on the best or recommended way to enjoy each dish. He is a true asset to Raku and serves their food with pride. Ask for him as your your server.

We ordered so much food but the most memorable was the Agedashi tofu.  I think it's housemade.  There's a subtle sweetness to the tofu that leaves me wanting more and more.  Dinner for two was around $150.  I recommend making a reservation since the place is small and usually packed.  I prefer the robata grill items over the sushi.

Being a part of the industry crowd it was awesome to have a late night place with the kinda food I like. This town is crying for better food without having to go to the strip or some shitty chain restaurant. I think that restaurants have spent years taking advantage of the fact that a lotta peeps still have the buffet mentality. Most bang for the buck even if it's frozen, reheated then slathered in mayonnaise. 

The quality of the food, presentation, setting etc is exceptional and should be the standard for restaurant expectations. People are tripping when they say Raku is overpriced. If you are that cheap and don't understand good food then stick to all you can eat sushi or the $10 buffet. 

Compared to any Japanese restaurant in the country for the prices they charge the food is phenomenal stars. 

However the issue I have is my last 2 visits. I saw a big change in their service staff from last year, not sure what happened. The old lady BTW is A FUCKING RUDE BITCH. Yes I come from an Asian background in culinary as well and what the hell is your problem after we spend $300 - $400 every time we go there??? 

Last couple of times they were out of numerous menu items. Understandably they prep x amount per day, but not once did they say that items were not available until we tried to order. It was annoying to the point that I finally asked the waitress to just tell me what they did not have. She next proceeded to repeat what I had already ordered, but was not available. Thanks. This happened several times. Getting drink order and refills was a major pain in the ass. The first round of food we ordered, all cold apps took nearly 50 minutes. In addition, some items we ordered the waitress came back 30 minutes later to tell us they were sold out. Table wasn't even bussed then somewhere near the 3rd round of food they came and pulled plates that we were still working on. 

All in all the service during my last 2 visits was almost nonexistent. Maybe it was the fact that on one of those visits the owner had a big party of friends on one table and that was their primary focus of the night. Who knows? I've seen lots of people being comped items and that doesn't bother me. The only thing I would expect is to have someone at least come to check on our drinks, bus the table without having to wait 25 minutes and at least keep us informed when food is going to take an hour.

 It's great to actually find a restaurant that takes pride in its' food and service, since there is so much flashiness and high priced menus nearby on the strip.

The specials each night are very interesting and well worth the taste... make sure you check the prices. Some items are out of the normal price range. 

Agedashi tofu is a must to end the meal. Warm, comforting, a bit of crisp, and incredibly fresh.

The poached egg, sea urchin, and salmon roe is a small dish, but huge in flavor! Very rich; this dish filled me up quickly and was surprisingly very satisfying (especially because westerners are not use to slimy textures... get over it!!).

Yellowtail carpaccio was stunningly beautiful; the fish is so rich in color and flavor. 

Basically everything we had was very fresh, tasty, and prepared with care.

Service was spot on. Sushi chefs are very nice when sitting at the bar, and are very good and thoroughly explaining the unique dishes that come.  Servers refresh plates often, and provide hand towels after eating the sticky Kama. Friday night they were a little more behind on service; I'd recommend the calm weekdays for perfect service... however, they are better than most restaurants.

Blended with the most highest quality Daiginjo flavors it easily is the best version of shoyu hubby's enjoyed!

Our meal composed of some superbly flavorful and fresh sea bass hira Suzuki done two ways sashimi and slightly charred yaburi on the exterior with a delightful charcoal smoked odor of authentic Japanese sumibi. Next we enjoyed another fish selection of Renkodai also done two ways, sashimi and then grilled, light on the palette but protein heaven!

Hubby had to have the Kobe beef liver as we obviously can't trust any establishment in Arizona to provide reliable liver sashimi and he devoured it with joy! Other must tries was the homemade tofu complimented with the house green tea infused salt.

My highlight was the Uni Udon, a cold dish served right in the urchin's shell, flavors of the broth mesmerized me speechless, dashi flavor brought umami levels outta this galaxy, definitely best dish I've had all year!

767787,2010-12-19,3,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Of all the cities, bars, restaurants and otherwise I've indulged my way through as a result of Yelp-scouting, Raku sits alone as my shining star. A few come close (Uchi in Austin comes to mind) but none quite capture the same balance of satisfaction vs. value vs. location that Raku does. It is, my greatest Yelp. 

When you can ride 200 reviews to a nearly flawless five star rating I feel little need to chronicle the intricacies of the place. Just know that it's about a $10 cab ride (each way) from The Strip, is quite small (with a couple of quaint private rooms) so reservations are recommended and it hands down serves the best food I've had in Sin City until an honest 3am. 

I was in Vegas this past week for an extended bachelor party and had narrowed down my ""must-do"" list to Raku from an initial pool of about 12 reccomendations on Yelp. While I eventually did manage to hit 3 or 4 candidate restaurants I suspected that I might only have one shot at a chance to steal away from the guys (not foodies) and see what the place was all about. It absolutely did not disappoint. 

I grabbed a seat at the five or six occupancy bar and immediately made friends with a cute Japanese girl who as it turned out was something of a fixture. She helped me through the menu (and three bottles of sake) from 11pm until after 3am as well as acted as intermediatary between myself and the owner. Whether or not he actually spoke English or just found my position amusing I don't know, but even without speaking to each other directly he was a cheery and fun guy. 

To satisfy my own memory I'll try and list everything I had. All were amazing, a few spectacular.

-Seafood with Bonito Guts Pickled in Salt
-Fresh Kobe Beef Liver with Garlic (had it sashimi style, also available seared)
-Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe
-Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth (best tofu I've ever had, in amazing broth with salmon roe)
-Raku's Tofu (unfried version of above, served with green tea salt and spicy vinegar, had a half portion of each)
-Steamd Egg Custard with Foie Gras (holy crap, maybe my favorite)
-Chicken Thigh (perfectly seasoned and grilled, on skewers, wow)
-Mushrooms (small, brown and marinated then grilled, don't remember much else)
-Ayu Kanro-ni (caramely whole river fish marinated in soy/sake/mirin and wrapped in banana leaf)
-Crispy Chicken Knees (sort of a chewier version of pork cracklins'...dude!)
-Some sort of sweet/salty rice cracker sticks
-Asparagus grilled and crusted with rice cracker
-Asian Pear Sorbet (holy freaking crap...utterly amazing)

Dishes ran anywhere from $3 up to about $12 for the foie gras and kobe liver. With three bottles of sake (no idea what they were, my dining companion picked three different ones), approx. 15 dishes (I'm forgetting a few), a $40 tip and some cash to the chef behind the grill/bar, I was still out of there for just a little over $200. 

My best advice if you find yourself within 200 miles of Vegas is eat here, at all costs, if you're at all into Japanese pub food. It's the best experience I've had in this country. If you speak any Japanese this is a great place to use it. That can be a mistake at most of the nice/trendy sushi places around the US where the majority of employees hail from other parts of Asia. But at Raku a boisterous ""itadakimasu!"" will be greeted with cheers; everyone is straight out of Nihon.

Oh and don't miss the specials board, 10 or so off-menu options that comprised most of my favorite selections.",9dtkPS9aKYNGzBZb76BFvA,7,6,5,nm-bzKn5F9tMNgS3fJUxzQ

Based on the yelp reviews I decided to give this a try. Called for a reservation pretty late and was given the table by the door. Maybe not the best table in the restaurant, but we really wanted to do so we decided to take it. Upon arriving, we were given another table as another customer had cancelled. Great!

Now the food; we ordered several dishes and all were really spectacular. Some that stood out were:

- Fried homemade Tofo  ...  this is THE BEST tofu and stock I have ever tasted. All is homemade, the tofu, dashi soup, etc ... no MSG's used which is so nice and the flavors are so well balanced and mild.
- Kobe beef tendon ... just think about butter melting in your mouth ... so tender and juicy ... the best of the best.
- Foie gras flavored egg custard ... a little different from what you would find in Japan, but again the flavors were so well balanced.

You will notice that you will eat less of this food as the flavors are so satisfying and the food takes some time to come out as ALL is made fresh. We spend about $100 for two adults and two children. Well worth the money!

Overall an incredible experience at a very reasonable price and well worth a five star!

The reservation process at Raku needs help. I understand this is a hot place, but I fail to understand the restriction on placing reservations only between 1400 and 1700 hours, then not answering the phone at all after 1700 hours. The voice mail message also says no reservations by message or email, and there is no web-based system like Open Table here either. Worse, the person taking the reservation wants all my personal info, and repeatedly warns me that there are other reservations and I have to be out by a certain time. This is dangerously close to serious pretentious snooty-ville, and I am hoping and praying that Raku does not fall victim to its own success and get too arrogant for its own good. Customer service first please. I realize American restaurants like to flip tables as fast as possible, but telling a customer to leave by a certain time is highly rude. Worse, I heard this said to a few other customers while I was there in-person. Wow.

I happened to be out of the country, and I stayed up until midnight just to make the call at Raku during their limited reservation window. Yeah, I'm a little miffed at this and maybe being too much of a whiner, but all is forgiven because...

All that being said, the food and service here is consistently stellar, and I will put up with this level of reservation combativeness as long as it doesn't get any worse. 

BTW, for all that reservation work, the place was 75% empty and remained so while we were there from 1830 to 2000 on a Thursday night. WTF?

My review remains: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

The cheesecake is like nothing I have had before. Actually, I call it a cloud cake. It is so incredibly light and fluffy. Its not overly sweet and it just melts away in your mouth. Its the best.

Of course I love chocolate and the molten lava cake is done very well here :)

The food here for vegetarians is limited. The home made tofu salad has cold raw tofu in it. If you enjoy tofu in that form, its interesting to try it.
The veggies from the Robata grill section are great. My fave being the potato and corn. (corn core is taken out and filled with mashed potato. Mmmmm)
The asparagus crispy tempura - its in a panko? or something batter.. really good. and fried green hot peppers are also very good.

If you dont eat fish: All the sauces and broths have fish in it and be careful to say no fish flakes because they like to put it on top of everything!

Can be pricey: The robata grill are tiny portions...2-4 pieces of the vegetable so that can definitely add up in cost when you are ordering oh about 15 of them...

We got 2 out of the 3 (caviar and foie gras) but watched the table of 6 next to us (5 out of 6 non-locals) who ordered the same higher end Omakase menu receive more and better quality dishes including a wagyu with egg dish. When we inquired about the disparity, we were told that the Omakase was based on the size of the table. However everything we saw the neighboring table receive, was on the regular a la carte menu so the refusal to serve us the Wagyu with egg and the fatty tuna dishes (especially after the server confirmed we had both ordered the high end Omakase) was surprising and perhaps, insulting given that we had been served a basic (ie bland) skewered filet from the Robata portion of the menu.

We had 8:30 reservations on a Sunday night and watched them have to turn people away without reservations or tell them that the wait was around 2 hours. So I would definitely get a reservation because the place is so small and popular. It is in a strip mall in Chinatown but once you get in it is lovely. Great atmosphere with super sweet staff saying things to you in Japanese when you enter and exit while you just smile and nod like you know what just happened. I also like the touch of the chopsticks resting on little chunks of charcoal on the tables. Staff was super helpful with our order and checked to make sure every dish was to our liking.

So we started with the grilled cherry tomatoes which sounds pretty basic but was fantastic. They were so smoky and salty. Seriously good. We also got the crispy asparagus which had maybe a panko crust. Also fantastic was a grilled squid from the specials board, miso soup, and grilled rice balls. The table favorites were the Agedashi tofu and Butter Seared Scallop. The flavor on both was just amazing.

The service was attentive and warm - when we ordered the baby barracuda, we were admittedly perplexed about how to eat it, and the waitress came over and showed us how to open it up and debone it (we're dumb, haha).  I thought that was really sweet of her, and she wasn't condescending about it at all, which was definitely appreciated and spared us some embarrassment :) .  She was incredibly professional - one of the best waitresses I've ever had.
The food was absolutely perfect. We had:

baby barracuda - simple flavors, flawless quality, fresh briny flavor, mmm
tempura asparagus - This was tasty - it had a unique but mild flavor, but it was very small, essentially one cut up piece of asparagus, so I don't know that I'd order it again.
steamed custard with foie gras - AMAZING!  Oh my god, so amazing.  Smooth, complex, rich, smoky, I can see myself craving this in the future and inconveniencing my boyfriend repeatedly to make him go back with me and get it again.
sashimi salad - FANTASTIC - consumate ingredients, simple preparation, great great great
grilled rice ball with salmon in dashi broth - their dashi broth (which was also featured atop the custard) is so tasty - I wish I knew how they made it :)
green tea crème brûlée - I always love this dessert, and their version was just fine, although I wasn't crazy about putting a scoop of ice cream on top, but oh well, it was still very tasty.
For my boyfriend and I the bill was about $80, which was mostly because we did a lot of sampling, but when I go back I'll have a better idea of what to order next time.

Food is Japanese tapas essentially and every dish is amazing and so well seasoned. 

Main highlight of the meal was the red snapper special - they fillet the fish in half and prepare each half differently. One half is baked on the bone so you get crispy, moist fish. Other half is cut into pieces, fried, and served with a yummy soy-based sauce. 

Second highlight was the homemade tofu. Use the green tea salt on the table for seasoning - it's so good. 

The beef skewers and the asparagus skewers were also just perfection.  The yellowtail carpaccio was good but the other dishes stood out so much more so next time I'd pass on this one. 

Best part was that we had several small plates and were stuffed, and the total for the two of us only came to $72!! Better than any food I've ever had on the strip for a fraction of the cost!

We ordered a lot. The items that literally blew my mind were the bacon wrapped enoki (how can you get so much flavor out of 2 ingredients? It was so umami!), the apple marinated lamb chop (the flavor of this was such a surprise - sweet and savory and oh so tender), and the foie gras don (which was so unctuous and rich and served with a sweet soy glaze over some shredded napa cabbage and rice. It was rich, sweet, savory, crispy from the napa cabbage and so darn good! Foie gras fans, do not ignore!). My hubby would add the yellowtail to this list. We also had the blue fin (beautiful presentation), the Kobe beef outside skirt (good but nothing special), duck breast (delicious, could really taste the smokiness of the grill), pig ear (good flavor, crispy but an interesting texture), chicken wing (good but there are better things to order), and there was a fish on special prepared 2 ways - grilled and fried in a to-die-for broth we had. Sorry can't remember the name of the fish. Everything was delicious and prepared simply and perfectly.

Each dish was brought out separately from lightest to heaviest. There was no rush to turn tables. You could just dine and really savor the food and the experience. We had reservations at 10:30pm and didn't finish until after midnight.

We hit up Raku again now that they've expanded, allowing a few more people to experience this fantastic place at a single time.  Do yourself a favor and don't walk in - you likely won't get a table.  Even on a Tuesday, at 6PM.  They're likely booked to 11 by then.  Reserve your table a day or so in advance and get in your 2 guaranteed hours of amazing food and intimate setting.

This time, we once again ordered the Agedashi Tofu, because... you can't NOT order it.  Even if you don't like tofu, you will love this dish.

A special we tried this time were the small fresh crabs, lightly fried and served posed on a small long dish, as if they're in a little procession of deliciousness... right into your mouth.  They're maybe each as big as a 50 cent piece.  You pop the entire thing into your mouth and chew.  In a word - amazing.  I'm not a big crab lover, but these were tasty, well seasoned, and delicious.  The shell on them is so light there's no worry of impaling your mouth with a piece of them.  My wife devoured them and we almost ordered seconds.  She talked about them on the way home.  The next day.  Just order them if they're available.

The core dishes that we re-visited from our previous trips are still excellent.  This time we also got 3 sake tasting special to sample with the meal and I was impressed not only with the choices (a filtered, an unfiltered, and a flavored one) but how inexpensive it was for the sampler ($14).  A good value and more than enough to keep a great mood through your meal.

As an update to my last post, I must say that Raku's desserts are quite excellent.  We've tried the different sorbets, the melty chocolate cake, the bubbly milk pudding, and they've all been wonderful.  Now if they only offered a Honey Toast dessert....

The service was perfect I was really pleased with the pace of the meal and friendly attentive service. I really appreciated how our server explained the condiments on the table. We started with the sake sample which was great. 

We had the enoki mushrooms wrapped on bacon. It was delicious, definitely a must have  here,  smoky earthy savory! Yum we ordered seconds  

We had the Kobe with the garlic spot on perfect. 

The pork cheek had a nice chew but was really tender and full of flavor. 


The Adashi tofu was presented beautifully It was devoured almost immediately. So simple so delicious. 

We got the ground chicken Popsicle beautiful crust so flavorful and savory, we got seconds. 

We also got the duck beautiful crispy skin complimented by the balsamic soy glaze.
The lamb chop was nicely done.

I splurged and got the foie gras. Melt in your mouth goodness, crispy exterior ridiculously flavorful so rich and decadent. Still thinking about it.   

We ended with the green tea creme brûlée. Perfect way to end our meal, served with hot roasted green tea.

It was a near perfect meal I can't wait to go back. I got a feeling I will be visiting Raku every time I'm in Vegas!",ksaVSZjFgOmnH2oblEPe2Q,4,1,5,Kkex1qjKH2N7_Wh9AQqF7w
1023885,2014-09-04,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"This was the best dinner I have had in YEARS. We were very lucky to get a reservation at the last minute, the hostess was very sweet and accommodating! The space itself is small, tastefully decorated, and feels like a step outside of Vegas entirely- it's quietly luxurious, with intimate tables and dimmed lighting. The minute we sat down, our waiter came over and explained the specials, one of which we decided to order, the Sukiyaki. We started with the Raku Tofu, which you would have to be crazy not to try. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The wait staff explain how best to enjoy it (first with some Green Tea salt, then with some ginger, green onion, and bonito flakes with a bit of soy sauce), and it is unbelievably delicious and silky. Even if you don't usually like tofu, I highly recommend trying this! We also tried the agedashi tofu, which was equally delicious and served in a perfectly seasoned broth with nori flakes and salmon roe, and a little spot of chili sauce on the side of the bowl to be used sparingly. Next we tried the kobe beef with garlic, which was another huge hit- incredibly flavorful, tender, just perfect. I am no steak expert, but my boyfriend is, and he was just as blown away as I was. We had the crispy deep fried chicken, which was served on top of a bed of spinach dressed with what I think was a soy vinaigrette- amazing. Then came the duck in a balsamic soy glaze, which is another MUST-order here- again, completely unlike anything I've ever tasted. We shared one stuffed small portobello, which was outstanding, and then came the sukiyaki. If they have this special when you visit, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It comes with eggs, which you crack into your own bowl and then use as a dipping sauce- I didn't do that part, but the sukiyaki itself was just unreal. The broth was perfect, not too salty but by no means bland, and there were noodles, tofu, greens, japanese eggplant, and the most amazing, thin sliced beef either of us had ever tasted. We made the mistake of ordering one too many things, and by the time the grilled rice balls (aka onigiri but without the nori) arrived, we were both right on the verge of being too full. If you are a fan of really high quality rice, you will love these- one is brown rice and flavored with bonito flakes, and one is white rice with a shinto leaf wrapped around it. Both are of course fantastic, but for us they weren't the stars of the evening the way the tofu and beef had been. And of course it wasn't over, we ordered the fluffy cheesecake- both of us gasped when we tried it. It is like eating a cheesecake cloud. It is the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake that exists on earth, I am sure of it. Even if you decide to follow up your meal with a trip to Sweets Raku (it was closed when we went, otherwise we probably would have gone- next time for sure!), this is another must. On top of the beyond amazing food, they have a fantastic wine and sake list, and the service was truly exceptional. Warm, attentive, prompt, helpful- it felt like we were being spoiled!

For the special last night they had Blue Fin Tuna Kamma aka the collar. It was rich in flavor with a hint of robata smokiness and delicate in texture.  I've read that while most fish is served boneless, people are missing out. ""Like a T-bone in a steak, bones in fish impart incredible flavor to the flesh"".  A lesson learned. 

Raku is definitely a treat to dine at.  Maybe it's because reservations are a must and I can't think that far ahead about what to eat.  But more so because it's not quite your ""let's have Pho"" or ""a burger"" kind of joint, or even a steak at Ruth's.

1114314,2012-12-07,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Japanese in  Las Vegas?  Okay, let's give it a try-I thought.  So I went.  

Very good Izakaya.  The chefs are trained by the head chef who has major skilss from Japan and from being a chef at Megu.  Megu to me is a bit more flash than elegance, but here I go.  Many things were very good, with a few minor disapointments. The head chef was trained in kaiseki which is amongst the highest forms of Japanese cuisine.  

ROBATA:  
Kurubuta pork cheak-this was great, with a real charcoal flavor from what I suspect is authentic Japanese charcoal.  This pork cheak was more tough than some, but was a wonderful texture and flavor. 

Kobe beef liver;  I am not a big liver fan, but this was great.  Usually well done cooking destroys kobe beef, but not here.  

Kobe tendon-this was the best tendon I have ever had.  I think it was braised first or something to soften the toughness.  It was rich and buttery with delicious flavor of soyu and mirin. 

Chicken skin and breast meet-This was so-so-breast meet tends to be a bit dry and so it was here.  I would have preferred a greater array of chicken choices than this-perhaps chicken skin alone, or wish bone, or something much more exotic. 

ODEN: 
Pork intestine:  Great flavors.  Very earthy and comfoting. I think the soup needed a bit more mustard for my taste, but I could easily have asked. 

Daikon:  What's to say here.

SASHIMI:  
Japanese sea bass;  okay, but not out of this world.  Fish wasn't as flavorful or well textured as I would have liked.

GREEN TEA SOBA: 
This soba came pre-dressed, so there wasn't a dipping sauce.  The texture was perfect-cold and firm. I had to ask for some wasabe for what seemed to me to be some needed balance, but perhaps I don't properly understand this dish.

VEGETABLES IN PONZU: 
Very nice, the ponzu seemed to use real yuzu, instead of lemon.  There was a bit too much of the dried bonito on top.  It sounds like they get very very good bonito from Japan.  Would have loved to try the miso soup to see. 

SOYU:  
Their recipe for soyu had a bit too much mirin or sugar for my taste.  Reminded me of Megu, and I have always sort of wondered if Megu isn't a bit Americanized. 

WASABE:  
Wasn't the usual fake stuff of sushi houses; it was the frozen stuff from the Pacific Northwest which is quite good. 

There was probably more.  The assistant chef-who works in the front of the bar- was quite well trained in the U.S., though he was Japanese.  The chef owner was in the back cooking, while this chef was at the bar preparing food.  Didn't have the deep food knowlege of a major chef, but was quite good nonetheless.  The sake was very decent and reasonably priced.   THere were supporting chefs who were latin american or MExican.  

This place is really worthwhile, and it can be very hard to get into. The chef has some serious skills and trains his people quite well.  Consider a ""kaiseki"" meal here if you go.  Probably nice to see what the chef can do with that.",U3ORHloeNfOD3XnGYc0gXA,0,0,5,oNVFPWVit6KfukDS7pQwew

Place is tiny.  Like 6 table tiny.

Ordered Omakase style.  Here's what I remember....

Homemade tofu.  First we had it in it's raw form and 2nd time around was fried.  The texture on the raw tofu was somewhat curdled, but soft.  I'm used to the silken tofu, but def appreciated the freshness of it.  The fried version is silken when you bite into it.  

Japanese ""nuclear"" Spanish mackerel.  Chef said it just came in from JP.  He wasn't lying.  The shashimi was decadent...smooth and buttery.  Just how I like it.  This was a happy ending to its own!!!

String mushroom wrapped bacon.  I'm beginning to see a little Morimoto-meets-Emeril-meets-PaulaDeen.  Unlikely combo that I WILL try to recreate at home.

Toro ""tuna"".  Subway should add this to their menu.  Seriously.  I would like it ""toasted.""  Imagine your regular tuna at the local subway substituted with this...finely chopped oh toro, green scallions, japanese mayo and secret sauce.",_D_IwjQggKgI0VL0O_CmdA,4,2,5,jSKJA8och3gBkf18ybIBOw

Apart from that we had:

Lamb Chop ++++
Sea Urchin with Seaweed Soup ++++
Braised Pork Belly. This was a special. OMG!  If you order it, make sure you order it towards the end because it is sooooooo filling! Let me tell you that this pork belly literally melts in your mouth. It's fatty, silky and very very tender at the same time. +++++ My hubbies favorite for the night
Grilled Okra ++++ Loved the grilled taste of it
Oden ++ Never ever had it in my life. So it was an experience. It's basically like a hot pot and you order the ingredients that comes with it. The broth and the ingredients we ordered were very very blend. The highlight here was definetly the filled napa cabbage. The tube fish had no taste whatsoever. The fish cake, radish and dough were so so. I could have skipped this one.
Chicken Wings ++++ delicious

As I am pregnant I could not try the Kobe Beef (it would had to be well done. And who wants to eat Kobe Beef well done??) or Foie Gras (eating liver during pregnancy should be avoided by any means) dishes. I would have loved to. Next time...

It's so good. We came by right when they opened for dinner, since we didn't have reservations and they were accommodating (or we totally lucked out). The place is really small, so reservations are recommended. 

They have three rotating board specials so you might see different specials being presented to different tables. If you ask, they will bring the other ones around to show you. 

We went a little nuts with our ordering, but mostly everything was amazing. 

Raku's Tofu: 
- Wasn't expecting to fall in love with this, I mean it's just tofu right? Wrong. It was really good with the different seasoning options. It's tofu, but it's different. Worth trying out if you come here since it's made in house. 

Yellowtail Carpaccio: 
Must get. It was just fresh and simple and delicious. 

Buttered Scallop: 
This was so good. The flavors were amazing and complemented the scallop. That butter sauce was so good, I wish I had something to sop it up. Actually, my friend loved it so much she picked up the shell to drink the sauce. 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe: 
It's a really rice dish, but it's amazing. We shared this, but I could have easily eaten this on my own. I thought it was going to be a little too fishy but everything was fresh and the flavors melded well together. 

Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard: 
So good. Rich, but so good. We shared this as well, but easily could have eaten our own. The flavors of the fois gras came through but wasn't too heavy, probably balanced by the egg. 

Agedashi Kama: 
Amazing. The fish was piping hot and moist. I thought I had tried a really good Hamachi kama at another restaurant in SF, but this one tops it for sure. It was just really flavorful and delicious. 

Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic:
Amazing. The beef was tender and perfectly cooked. The flavors were on point. 

Kobe Beef Tendon: 
This was a little different from what I expected. I'm used to tendon in soups, so I don't eat dry tendon often, but it was delicious nonetheless. 

Kurobuta Pork Cheek: 
Delicious. The flavor was slight and smoky. Some places overcook it and make it chewy but this was perfect. 

Bluefin sashimi:
Prepared three different ways, fresh, grilled, wrapped in Sushi. All three ways were delicious, mainly because the fish was so fresh. You can really taste the freshness. 

Beef Waygu sashimi: 
Sounded amazing, but it was a disappointment. The meat was really chewy and it wasn't as good as the Kobe Outside Skirt with Garlic we ordered. 

Fluffy Cheesecake: 
We were intrigued by the description. We even poked at it when it came to the table, but the description of a ""Mousse Cheesecake"" is fitting. It's just really good. I'd order this again. It didn't feel heavy at all. 

We also ordered a different sashimi option but it wasn't nearly as good as the Bluefin. I think our two disappointing items were the Beef Waygu sashimi and the other fish sashimi option. 

I'll definitely come back here. It was a pricey but delicious dinner. Worth every penny.",0oYT4_OuVmN_4XWNBt8ypw,5,3,5,Kmb44vH10dg_YkghYXFx6A

It's kind of an izakaya but not really since it's more upscale than that, the service is painfully slow and they serve dish they wouldn't have in a Japanese izakaya.

We went there at 9:30 without a reservation. The host said he could seat us in 30 minutes so we told him we would go to Sweets Raku next door and have dessert first. It seemed like a good plan but then he called not 10 minutes after we started eating our first dessert course to say our table was really so we missed that opportunity since we could abandon our food at Sweet Raku.

We got back to Raku at 10:30 and waited for a table and waited and waited, once it got past 30 minutes we should have left but it became a game to see just when we would get a table. It was 11:30 when we got seated and 1:45am when we finished. The service was incredibly slow. In the first 45 minutes we only got three dishes-one every 15 minutes. I've been Izakayas in Japan and in North America so I know that the ones in North America are very different and far more upscale and slow than the common ones in Japan. Usually if I spend that much time in one in Japan it's because there has been lots of drinking and lots of food.
But the food, the food was good enough that I would go back and would recommend it to a diner with time to spare. The foie gras chawanmushi was awesome. We got a special of grilled langoustines that wasn't over cooked and served whole. the yellowtail carpaccio as well as the grilled yellowtail was good. I don't know if the tofu was the freshest I've ever had but it was really excellent in terms of texture. The cost was pretty reasonable, 100 dollars for two people without alcohol. They mixed up our orders twice. Towards the end there was a table of regulars that came in and they got served immediately and got 6 dishes in less than 30 minutes meanwhile there were two tables with reservations that had to wait with us and they waited quite a bit. So don't expect fair or quick service. I wouldn't recommend Raku for a vegetarian as many of the vegetable dishes have fish stock or other animal products in the prep.

Among  my limited exposure to Japanese kaiseki and other haute cuisine, Raku offered one of the most humble yet most exquisite experience. The presentation is formal but the atmosphere is quite casual. We dined at one of the two back rooms at the small restaurant. Exclusive but not totally isolated from the lively robata gill ambiance. The three hour dinner was a feast to my sensory mind and a truly memorable affair. 

Advanced reservation for kaiseki is a must. The reservation process was almost ridiculous. You will need to provide your credit card number at the time of your phone call. They will then email you their terms and conditions to which you must accept or your reservation will be canceled. They will call you up the day before your reservation to make sure you are still planning to keep your reservation and then remind you again on the same day. I don't think I had to confirm this many times even for famous Michelin starred restaurants. Oh yes and don't be late because they won't hesitate to give away your table.

The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.

I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.

My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.

I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.

Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.

1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth

2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi

3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce

4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce

5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu

6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell

7. Eel with shisho pepper

8. Uni with egg

9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce

10. Mixed tuna over rice

11. Panna cota

As you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat.

 I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.

Service was always with a smile all evening.

The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.

The service was excruciatingly slow.  They served one course (which is one bite in some cases) and then we'd wait 10-15 minutes.   This is not
good for a 15-course dinner.  At some point I asked them to pick up the pace which didn't really help. 

It was ridiculous.

That said, many of the dishes were fantastic.  Two tofu dishes were great.  The soups were great.  The panko encrusted asparagus was great.

My wife had been here 3 months prior and had a great dinner just ordering off the menu.

I also WOULD NOT CALL THIS KAISEKI.  More like a chef's selection.

My friend recommended a sushi restaurant he had been to the previous year somewhere in China Town. 

We found the place pretty quickly but walking in I could tell this was not a sushi restaurant. As a matter of fact they didn't have any sushi on the menu but what they had was an extremely pleasant surprise.

We started with the Age Dashi Tofu which we were told was made with home made tofu. The broth was sweet and flavorful and the roe added a complimentary saltiness. I am not normally a huge fan of Tofu but I had never had it prepared quite like this. We then moved on to the lamb chops which were smokey and delicious. It was a little chewy but lamb tends to be.

We then had a sashimi plate from the special menu and for the life of me I can not remember the name of it and I have looked through all of the pictures and did not see it. It was an extremely thin sliced sashimi presented on a large plate somewhat like Fugu. It was paired with what tasted like a tomato wasabi paste that when mixed with the special ponzu sauce combined for a flavor experience that was out f this world.

We also had a serving of the Raw Beef Tatake which was topped with a dollop of ginger and garlic and a small amount of cavier. YUMO. his may have been my least favorite dish but it was still awesome. 

Then came the Kalkimachi Asparagus. Oh my god it was hot and so crispy and had a hint of bacon flavor that was AMAZING.

Our last dish was the ground chicken portobello which was also delicious. But by then we were pretty full and our taste buds were on overload except for desert.

My Buddy decided to sample two deserts, the Green Tea Brule and the Brown Sugar Bubbly Pudding. What can I say. These two deserts capped of a culinary experience that was not only unexpected but completely unforgettable. 

My understanding is that you cant get in here with out a reservation on weekend so you should plan ahead.

The skewered chicken thigh was delicious with the green tea salt.  I LOVED the aga dashi tofu!  I don't even LIKE tofu, but I totally downed my half.  The skewered duck was flavorful, though a little tough.  We had a white fish sashimi that was fabulous and some tuna sashimi that was very nice.  The enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon had an awesome texture combination.  I think we also ordered some kind of skewered beef, but neither of us thought anything too much of it.

Save yourself a few hundred bucks and get this advice for free from me.

I met this lovely girl who went by the name of Miley at a little club called Sapphire.  So in the VIP room, I have this gorgeous girl half-naked sitting in my lap, and we're talking about food, a subject of one of my many passions.  Among many of her many recommendations, she kept saying how good Raku is.  She explained in detail the blue-fin tuna, kobe beef with wasabi, green tea creme brulee and ice cream.  She also explained how it was open from 6pm to 3am and is closed on Sunday.  Hmm, I wonder if she really works there.  She assures me she doesn't.  Whatever.  I still have to convince the guys to go there... It's Saturday, 2am, we have to go NOW or never!  I'm able to convince 5 of us.  We hop in the car and head down Spring Mountain, west of the 15, made a right after the Jack in the Box just like Miley said.  There it is!!

This place happens to be a tapas-style Robatayaki, or Japanese style grill.  About 1/3 of the menu is served on skewers, and if my nose is correct, they're grilled on coals.

EVERYTHING we ordered Wowed us to no end!!!  We ordered everything that I could remember Miley talk about plus a few more.  We shared it all.  Simplicity is a key ingredient, but with a distinctly beautiful haute touch.  Hell, even the bathroom was awesome!

The blue-fin tuna sashimi was nicely plated served with freshly grated wasabi.  The melt-in-your-mouth foie gras was delicious.  Usually agedashi tofu is a bore to me but was outstanding.  Kobe beef with wasabi was perfect.  The Kobe carpaccio made me forget the carpaccio salad I had for lunch at CarneVino!  The roast duck in balsamic was almost too gorgeous to eat!  ALMOST...  At 3am, practically the end of the bachelor party weekend, we were all on the verge of gastric over-stimulation.  Dishes kept coming.  We kept wow-ing.  Then came the creme brulee.  We all just about exploded, died, and went to food heaven.

I felt like crying in gratefulness and thanked all of the staff for the incredible experience.  I bowed and did my best to say ""Oishii desu"" as I left.  I can't can't can't can't wait to return...

1361052,2013-02-03,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I've been wanting to eat here for a couple years now. This past Wednesday I invited Angela to come with me.

I called the night before and made a reservation for 1900. I asked for the omikase menu and was told they have a $75 and a $100 (per person) menu. People actually opt for the $75? Seriously, if you're going to go out and eat and do something like this, go all out.

So I chose the $100. It's a 10 course meal. I asked if that was enough food and she assured me it would be. 

We came early, about 20 minutes early but they had a table for us. We got one of their private booths which I'm guessing we only got it because we came early. 

Oh yeah, I possibly should have started this review with saying that this place might be the best Japanese restaurant I have ever, EVER been to.

I honestly don't remember every single meal we got but it was all amazing. I'll list them and discuss what I thought was the best thing.

We were given grilled cherry tomatoes, four different types of sashimi, grilled kobe beef, grilled pork, homemade cold tofu, agedashi tofu in broth, green tea creme brule, cheese cake and a hot pot with kobe beef in a red bean broth. The last thing was our 11th course as we still wanted another dish after the 10 though honestly, I think we were good and full after the 10 but the food was so good we wanted to try one more dish.

A lot of their food comes from organic farms. This is important because the best thing we had was our grilled pork. It's prepared, medium. Yep, not fully cooked. The waitress told us the pigs are only fed acorns. It. Was. God-like. I couldn't believe pork could taste so good especially cooked medium. Way better than even the kobe beef. The homemade tofu, crazy good. Crazy good. The condiments on the table are even amazing. They make their own soy sauce and it's the best soy sauce I've ever had. They have some kind of wasabi salt. I've never even heard of such a thing. Outstanding. Our last dish, the hot pot, they gave us two raw eggs. I'm thinking that we're going to crack these eggs into the broth. Totally wrong. We're told to crack the eggs into our bowls, scramble it, and then use it as dipping sauce for the food that comes out of the hot pot! Again, the eggs are organic. Taste was amazing. And made complete sense as the broth is really sweet, remember it's red bean based so the raw egg totally balances the taste. So awesome. Seriously, so awesome. And I mean all the food we had was so awesome. Actually, it's AWESOME. If I could, I'd eat here every week. Well, I promised myself that next time I come here I'll either omikase at the sushi bar or I'll do the kaiseki which you need to make a reservation 3 days in advance for!

Raku is located off the strip in Chinatown- parking is terrible so I suggest you take an Uber here. Seating is limited, so I highly suggest you make reservations beforehand.

My friend and I shared the following dishes:

-kobe beef with wasabi ($12): a skewer of seasoned kobe beef with a touch of spice from the wasabi. Oh so good. The meat was tender and flavorful.

-chicken breast wrapped with chicken skins ($3): tender, and incredibly juicy chicken breast with a dash of salt. The chicken skin added an extra texture to the juicy meat. This was so good that we had two orders of it. 

-butter sautéed scallop with soy sauce ($7): scallop sautéed in a bath of butter, served on its shell. This dish came out sizzling hot. The hot butter and soy sauce complimented the sweet scallop flavors.

-agedashi tofu ($7.50 for a half order): in house made tofu, lightly battered, fried, and served in a super concentrated bath of dashi. The tofu takes on a nice creamy texture contrary to what you perceive as a tofu texture. It's also topped with salmon eggs, so each bite is an explosion of flavor. 

-foie gras bowl ($18.50): a generous portion of seared foie gras served on a bed of rice + lettuce. This was so decadently delicious. The foie gras was buttery and unadulterated. I would recommend ordering this over the foie gras skewer because the rice from the don mitigates how rich the foie gras is.

Last, but not least, I came here for the poached egg with uni and ikura ($9). This was unlike anything I have ever, ever tasted in my life. The smooth, creaminess of the uni combined with the silky texture of the poached egg was mindblowingly good. There are added crunchy components to the dish as well, so it provides a medley of textures and flavors in one bite.

I have a predilection for fatty goodness and uni; having said that, the highlights for me were the agedashi tofu, pork cheeks, duck with balsamic and the poached egg with sea urchin and ikura.

The uni was the most memorable IMO - but FYI I have been known to demolish uni by the tray, and I don't mind different textures. The dish is a slippery, slimy combination of egg yolk, ikura, okra, uni, and nagaimo (a yam that Japanese like to eat raw - few calories but very very slimy). If you don't mind the texture, the experience is unforgettable.

The foie gras was memorable too - I read here on yelp that it's recommended to eat it with rice because it's so rich - and the server asked me if I would like a ""rice bowl"" and I asked if she recommended the ""rice ball"" instead - she said I must try the ""bowl"" - and turns out that because of her accent I understood ""ball"" as ""bowl""...

We started with the monthly Sake sampler which was a treat for me because normally I just order the cheap hot sake offered at most Japanese and sushi restaurants. This was a delicious start to our meal! 

We then ordered: 
-Sashimi Salad (I absolutely loved this... my favorite dish all night)
-Raku's tofu (The first authentic house made tofu I've ever tried, don't expect a lot of flavor but they do have some accompaniment sauces)
-Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth (Agedashi tofu, I preferred this over the cold Raku tofu)
-Kurobuta Pork Cheek (mind blowing! a must-try)
-Chicken Thigh (eh, this was so-so)
-Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce (DELICIOUS!)
-Asparagus Wrapped with Bacon (very good, but not much different than you'd have anywhere else)
-Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic (very enjoyable)
-Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe (This was the experimental dish my boyfriend urged us to order and try. Definitely some interesting flavors! I'll be honest and say I don't find myself craving it :P )

The restaurant is small, probably fits about less than 30 people. 

There were two choices for the pre fixe menu. $75 & $100. We decided to go for the $75 menu. 

1. Soft Tofu- house mad tofu. So good! It comes with some green onions and ginger, then you pour plum soy sauce on it for a salty flavor.

2. Tomato skewer- Baby cherry tomatoes marinated in garlic olive oil. This had amazing flavor but to be honest, I could make this at home. 

3. Sashimi Bowl- 5 different types of raw fish, I loved this part of the dinner! everything had a different texture and flavor

4.Grilled Prawn- hmm.. not impressed. 

5. Flying Fish- Fried finish with fried mushrooms in soy sauced based sauce. I think I was pretty full by this point, so I didnt enjoy it so much

6. Grilled Waygu Beef  with Wasabi skewer- All the guys loved this. Beef was tender.

7. Grilled Spanish Ham skewer- Think of it as pork belly on a stick, so when you chew the ham all the fat and oil sinks into your mouth. I could only eat a bite of this.

8. Salmon Rice- Eh... I didn't like the flavors as much. I think there was too much ginger in this dish so it killed the flavor.

9. Strawberry Mint Sherbet with condense melt- I love dessert, but I wasn't impressed! I could make this at home.

1424681,2014-02-22,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"In town for a bachelor party and the bachelor and his brother are both chefs so I knew when they set up a reservation at this place that it was upon good research and recommendation. 

We received 7 courses in total, each better than the last. As we waited for dinner to begin we enjoyed sake as well as the ambience. The bathrooms in Raku where really breathtaking. Unfortunately just before dinner they were both occupied and my friend was forced to quietly vomit in a private corner.  Very accommodating, indeed. 

First up was a tofu dish. I don't typically enjoy tofu but this was different. It was a soft tofu that was perfectly seasoned, and the condiments were perfectly paired. In fact, perfect condiments were the theme of dinner. Such a seemingly small detail but when done right it goes a long way! All at the table enjoyed the tofu with the exception of my friend who had been busy eradicating his upper GI tract of any free radicals since we sat down. He excused himself to the bathroom to seek solitude in the cool grass floor covering and  the warm heated toilet. 

Next out was the fish. I'm not well versed in fish so I won't attempt to rehash all the sashimi that we enjoyed but it was all well cut, presented, and of course delicious. Once again the condiments were perfect. The pickled ginger was a fresh take on ginger for me.  At this point the sake was really flowing and our friend returned. I fed him a piece of tuna and he found it so tasty his body immediately began telling him he should make room for more, so after ordering him a ginger ale we excused him to step outside and take some air.

The lamb chops- my goodness. I don't think I've ever had them so succulent before! Fortunately for us our friend was still enjoying the night air, so we had one to spare. As we speculated wether or not our friend would quietly disappear into a taxi cab outside we divided his chop and all the meat quickly disappeared. Against all odds our friend returned and next up was the whole fried flying fish. 

The meat of the flying fish was wonderful, but I was feeling bold and went after the fish skeleton. Whole fried fish skeleton is delightfully crunchy and the cheek of the head is arguably the best part of the fish. We quickly layer waste to two entire fish and when the frenzy was over only the fins remained. I hope I have a chance to enjoy flying fish again'

Next came the beef. When our friend saw the Kobe beef yakatori with wasabi on top he was so excited he couldn't stop himself from evacuating his stomach right there at the table. We'd later take advantage of an extra foie gras courtesy of our friend. It turns out that when you're slouched over in your chair with your forehead against the cool wallpapered wall of a restaurant and slyly booting on the floor next to your chair, it makes you think about life, it makes you feel generous and you share more food with your friends. 

As dinner wound down and we finished all the sake, our friend finally turned the corner and was able to eat some fried chicken. We enjoyed the company of our waitress and the family atmosphere. We enjoyed a few more dishes but I'll leave the reader to explore the menu on their own. You really must go to Raku!  Food was A+, restaurant was beautiful, and the staff was private and polite!

Best Dishes:
Poached Egg with Sea Urchin (salmon roe, jalapeno, mushrooms, mountain root in soba broth served cold) - Amazing well constructed with a perfectly poached egg and various layers of flavor that all worked together.  A bargain at $9.
Foie Gras Chawanmushi (egg custard with a hint of foie gras, smoked duck and black truffle) - Creamy, rich, delicious!  $10
Juicy Fried Chicken (six medallions of chicken, fried, over a bed of baby spinach) - We weren't going to order this, but our waitress highly recommended it, and we're glad she did. $9
Enoki Mushroom with Bacon - great flavor from the grill and a thick, lean, juicy cut of bacon. $2.80 for two.
Kamo Grilled Duck (with balsamic soy sauce) - tender, well seasoned, and not gamey at all.

Good Dishes:  Agedashi Tofu, Momo Chicken Thigh, Grilled Veal

Disappointing:  Kobe Beef with Wasabi (surprisingly ordinary), Tontoro Kurobuta Pork Cheek (too fatty for our taste), Sashimi Salad (expected more from Raku)

Price.  We thought the prices were quite reasonable for a restaurant of this quality.
Service.  For the most part, the wait staff was pleasant and informative.  They were not very attentive - we did have to ask for refills, etc.  But, because the restaurant was small and not crowded, it was fairly easy to get their attention.

We ordered 8 seats for omakase. It was delicious. I loved everything that came out. I can't remember everything or the proper names, but everything was great. I would love to come out again the next time I'm in town :) 

It was a 10 course omakase for 9 girls. Everyone had plenty to eat and were stuuuuffed by the end. It started with sashimi of this wonderful white fish. Light fresh flavor, great texture. Unfortunately I forget it's name. Then the other half of the fish came out fried. I was great to have it cooked 2 different ways. And both ways the meat was delicious. They also served us slices of this wonderful mushroom. Again! I'm sorry I forget the name of it. It's suppose to be a special kind of mushroom, a sort of delicacy. It was suggested we try it first w/o the accompanied sauce, then with, if we wished. It was great both ways, and actually preferred the light mushroom flavor without the soy based sauce. 

Another favorite was their fresh agedashi tofu and the best kobe beef skewers. The pork cheek was also delicious and had great texture, not gamey (said some of our guests that are sensitive to pork).

Other things that came out was yakitori chicken meat balls. Good but I think the texture was a little too soft. Though it was moist and not over cooked. Grilled grape tomatoes on a skewer. These were light a sweet and refreshing. There was a tataki beef skirt dish good too though I preferred the skewered beef :) A sort sort of  miso soup but thicker. It didn't have anything in it except some green onions and salmon eggs on the top. It was rich and creamy and served cold. I personally liked it but a few out of our group weren't big fans of this. They also closed with a salmon stone pot rice dish, that included flaky salmon and salmon eggs. I'm not usually a fan of salmon roe but it was fresh and not to fishy. Though I'd say I could pass on this last dish. 

We closed with a great strawberry sorbet. For my friend's special day they served her a ""cheese cake"". But it wasn't just cheese cake. It was light an fluffy, like the ""cheese"" was created into a mousse so it was light and not overly sweet. 

As a side note they also have on the table a green salt... i think some sort of green tea salt?... man was that flavorful and yummy. A light saltiness, slight savory flavor.

First, call to make sure they're open. I went a while back and they were randomly closed on a Wednesday. But I would not be denied this time.

I sat at the bar after about a 15 minute wait. Asked for a bottle of sake. Dude replied ""glass?"" I said no, bottle. I'm not here to play. Actually I was.

I will re-emphasize previous reviews: if you remotely like tofu or want to try it, get the agedashi tofu. It's as good as it gets. Kinda crispy on the outside with ridiculously good flavor. Slight nori-like flavor which I liked.

I got the wagyu carpaccio. Personally I didn't like it as much as the other dishes. It was a bit too chewy in texture for my liking.

Kurobuta pork belly was ridiculous. Get it. Off the chain, hook and any other fasteners.

Not sure if things were brought out randomly but I had the foie gras egg custard last which was a bit heavy to finish with. Got a few other things, all good. Scallops: gooood. Get it too.

1497728,2013-01-31,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku broke through the glass ceiling of my expectations of what a great meal is in Las Vegas. My companion and I made reservations on a Saturday night and there were no open ones until 9:30 - I would recommend reservations early as the waitress said that she couldn't see any open seats when we called at 6. 

Upon walking in we were told to sit at some high chairs near the back while we waited for a table to be cleared. We examined the room, noting the cleanliness and deliberateness of the space and after a minute or two were taken to a table. 

With some cash to blow and empty stomachs to fill we began to pick out some things on the menu that instantly caught our eye - Sashimi Salad, Yellow-tail Carpaccio, Juicy Fried Chicken, a Miso Soup (I always have to order one), Kobe Beef Skirt with garlic, Scallop with Soy Sauce, Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, and Mushrooms to start off the night.

The food came out in a more logical way than we ordered it. First, the Sashimi Salad was insanely good! The fish, greens and dressing complimented each other very well giving us a balanced start to our meal. The Yellow-tail carpaccio came out as we were finishing the salad; the yellow-tail was fresh, had amazing texture and simply was astounding. The Juicy Fried Chicken was very rich - I had a hard time eating more than one (although my companion easily scarfed down the rest of them!). Despite my love for Miso Soup I find that they never vary between restaurants too much - Raku's soup will be noted in having tiny, whole mushroom and large chunks of tofu. Kobe Beef Skirt with garlic was tender and juicy with a great flavor. My companion really loved the duck; I found it quite tasty as well. The mushrooms made a great appearence by breaking up the flow of all the meat/fish dishes we had been having. 

And then there was the Scallop. Oh man, that scallop was revolutionary. The waitress dropped off the scallop served inside of the shell with soy sauce on top; my companion and I split it and were amazed at the light sweetness, the soft texture and the overall quality of the dish. 

We were full. And then we noticed - the menu contains a few items with a red symbol next to them. I asked the waitress what that meant and she explained those were the specialties of Raku. Specialties? And we hadn't tried the restaurant's specialties? Despite our full stomachs we continued onward to order Agedashi Tofu and Tsukene Ground Chicken. We agreed both far exceeded our expectations - I had never tried tofu that has been prepared better and I could eat the ground chicken every day for the rest of my life (A guy can dream, right?). 

And then the finisher, the end, the encore of the concert, the final chapter in a book, the last mile of the marathon - dessert. Green tea creme brulee with green tea ice cream on top. Our stomachs were exploding before we got this, we devoured the whole thing and deliberated very seriously on getting another one. We decided against it only because we had reached stomach capacity. 

The food can be costly if you order a lot. However, the experience was well worth the $76.80 subtotal for two people tasting that much food. 

Amazing atmosphere, quality ingredients, fantastic company (your mileage may vary), professionally prepared and plated with great service - everything that anyone wants in a dining experience. 

Have you noticed how much I loved this place? I'm having a hard time even explaining - it's like having an adrenaline rush and remembering how fun, exciting, interesting and amazing the experience was wihtout having any more words to share with others than ""TRY IT YOURSELF."" You will be super happy that you did and have an awesome time.",0K20OaDhb313HpJf7v8qjA,2,0,5,rDU3XdCJumi_tqW_PwdQZw

The housemade cold tofu is incredibly silky - I like it best with their green tea salt and the crispy garlic chili sauce. The Kobe beef skewers with garlic chips are incredible too. The aka dashi tofu is warm and so comforting. The pork cheek has just the right ratio to make it deliciously fatty but not chewy or gummy.. 

And just when I think I'm so stuffed and couldn't possibly eat another bite, they bring out the kamameshi. Somehow, everything in my stomach shifts to make room for a bowl of RICE.

Minus 1 point for service-they were busy, we sat at the counter, the guy at counter did not talk to anyone at all, we did not get to order for over 15 minutes.

My first Agedashi tofu ever. OMG what an experience, they said they make their tofu themselves, the presentation was wonderful, the sauce complimented the tofu well, a little bit of ikura for saltiness, nice texture etc!  The foie gras chawanmushi (forgot what this is called in english..maybe egg custard thing) was super creamy, nice texture, but I felt the foie gras made it a little too rich for me, but it was delicious.  Bacon wrapped enoki, good...salmon belly had nice crispy skin.  I forgot what else we ordered but all of it was wonderful.

I'm told that ordering a meal a la carte is actually quite decent. Judging by our actual omakase experience, however, I'm incredibly skeptical. For starters, most of us were still hungry after our meal, even after filling up all day on beers, cupcakes, hotdogs, candy, sake, Hawaiian BBQ, Korean BBQ, you name it. Additionally, the only dish that brought out any sort of excited response from our group of eight was this plain fried chicken dish -- and even that quickly turned into a discussion of real fried chicken: KFC vs. Popeyes. Everything else was immediately forgettable. I was still wondering when ""the good part"" of meal was actually starting when they announced that the final dish was being brought out. Easily the worst omakase experience I've ever had anywhere. I'd sooner go to McDonald's and order a burger-flipping-high-school-kid's choice tasting menu. 

But even with average food in small quantities, we could have had a decent meal and left. Nope. We were forced to wait an ungodly amount of time between each dish being presented. I'm talking ten minutes as an absolute minimum between the time our plates were cleared and the time a new dish was brought out. And since each ""dish"" is really just a tiny booger on a plate, that meant a lot of hangry people. To make the wait even more unbearable, there was horrible jazz music playing at barely-audible volume. This made us all incredibly sleepy and disinterested in conversation or food. It all just felt incredibly forced, like we were supposed to believe our meal was way more epic than it actually was due to the sheer amount of time spent in the establishment. Really doesn't work.

Not sure what people mean about the absolutely necessary reservations. We showed up at 7pm on Saturday night and left after 9pm. I would think that should be the prime dinner period. Less than half the restaurant was occupied the entire time.",PTD6ocdGBUa-dcXS3Vr7Xg,12,3,1,SBbNWK-ZnY44HCRW6j8brA

Dishes I had included:
- Bluefin tuna sashimi special - amazing tuna with soy-marinated seaweed, lightly pickled chrysanthemum (in place of traditional ginger), and fresh wasabi. So fresh and delicious.
- Grilled skewers: bacon-wrapped mushrooms, chicken skin-wrapped chicken breast (awesome), kobe beef with wasabi (a highlight), and kobe beef tendon (not what I was expecting, but in a good way - a large gelatinous mass with a viscous, but not unpleasant, mouthfeel - and amazing caramelized & grilled taste).
- Foie gras chawanmushi - great texture and flavor of the chawanmushi and broth, with a nice piece of duck on top.

The sashimi and grilled skewers were the highlights for me (though the mushroom was overshadowed by the other items).

I was lucky enough to get a table for two, two days before. I had asked for the $50 per person omakase dinner and we were both happy with the results. From prior posts, people seemed to get uni or foie gras, but we didn't get that at all. I was a little disappointed but I didn't let that get in the way. We received the following: sashimi salad, seared kobe beef, grilled kobe beef with fried garlic, fried tofu with soup, fried asparagus okaki, bacon wrapped mushroom, grilled baby tomatoes, tsukune-grilled ground chicken, grilled pork cheeks, steamed clams with wine broth, and grilled rice ball. We also ordered the hamachi kama and japanese cheese cake for dessert. Husband is usually very picky in terms of trying new food but he enjoyed this place! He especially loved the japanese cheesecake as it was soft, creamy and different. A must try... we'll definately come here again!!!

PS, call in advance for a reservation if you can. We saw a group of three people get denied a seat even though there seemed to be tables, but I believe they do two seatings only.

We also got the Saki flight and that was a great look considering the majority of the table came to the restaurant buzzed and drunk.

They turned away 6 parties as  I was there because they could not accomadate.

Decor : very cute dark lighting woodsy feel. Very nice intimate setting.

Think Tapas. Small Bites but a whole lot of flavor. =D

Foie Gras w/soy sauce Glaze - Yum! Omg! If I could describe this correctly, it is like a melt in your mouth with a soft glaze and crispy outer shell. Like Perfect! So good!

Kurobuta pork cheek skewer - Yum. The Cheek is soo meaty and juicy and good. =D

Kobe Beef Filet Skewer w/ Wasabi - Yes please! The meat the meat seasoned perfectly, it was so good. The wasabi mind you was real wasabi w/ real bits in there to clear up those sinuses!! 

Poached Egg Custard with uni - Good. Egg Custard was very light and fluffy. Made perfectly, topped with uni and some daikon? radishes. It was good, but I felt like the uni portion was very small comparable to the egg proportion. The daikon radish, gave it some texture, but I am not sure if it complemented the dish as much. I iked the okra slices. =D yay for okra!

Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard - Ehh. I felt like the Egg overpowered the Foie Gras taste, but you can still taste it. It was a large proportion of egg to foi gras. It was still good, but not as great.

Scallop w/soy sauce glaze - Good. I liked the scallop with presentation. It was cooked perfectly, however I felt the soy sauce glaze was a little salty with the scallop, but it was still good. 

Wagyu Beef Sashimi w/raw wasabi & beef infused soy sauce - OMG. Heaven. So good. the meat was like butter where it just melts in your mouth and isn't too overpowering with the wasabi. the wasabi was very good. The soy sauce was infused with beef as well. Whatttt!!! you can actually taste the flavors.

Green tea creme brulee - Good! Yum. It is actual green tea creme brulee. The texture was perfect and the Green Tea flavor did not overpower. It was very good.

I would have went to Sweets by Raku next door, but It was closed by the time I finished dinner. Find the big Spoon on the wall since they don't have a sign yet.

Overall: Definitely coming back. Comparable price & quality wise, it is about the same price as a Vegas Buffet, but man,  the quality is just superior.

Maaaaaaaan, it's a fantastic IZAKAYA spot, tucked away in the heart of Chinatown, its open until 2:00 am, it caters to industry people, the foodies, locals and newbies. The experience they offer you is simultaneously calm and adventurous. They define umami with their unassuming ohitashi and break barriers on simplicity with their konbu seaweed. I didn't even mention the meat and seafood---pork ear, chicken thigh, fried ice fish, kurobuta pork cheek, kobe beef tendon....
You can't even compare a Nobu to a Raku. Nobu is Japanese with South American (mainly Peruvian) influences. Its the sh*t, no doubt, but don't be that ""dummie""---give Raku a little more credit.

Ladies, and Gents...Raku is beyond that.

I popped in on a whim the other night. Countless coworkers would tell me about how this was the BEST restaurant in all of Las Vegas. I took it for granted, because people always say that about one restaurant or another. I guess I had to experience it for myself.

A friend and I stopped in without a reservation last week. It's a small restaurant and each of the tables (but one) was occupied. The dining room is small. It may remind you of the dining scene in San Francisco or New York City. The kind of place that begs for your attention through it's subtle exterior.

After a short wait, we were seated at a nice table.

We ordered:

-Agadashi Tofu -- So perfect and so good!
-House Tofu -- Also amazing. Next time I'd probably get half and half with Agadashi.
-Black Cod -- Better than Nobu. This was off the seasonal Fish menu.
-Crispy Asparagus -- Perfectly cooked, crunchy, crispy delicious.
-Fried Shrimp -- Delicious. These are full shrimp. Don't get grossed out by the shrimp heads.
-Green Tea Creme Brulee -- The perfect ending to a fantastic meal.

Your table will have some seasonings on it. A green tea salt. A chili powder. A sake chili thing. And soy sauce which is incredible and seasoned with plum. 

Use these seasonings. Mix and match. They tend to provide a different experience with each mixture.

This one meal is a Top Five for me. I'm no stranger to food, and good food at that. This is the spot that is a MUST TRY when you are in Vegas.

Total Bill for Two -- About 60 bucks.

Raku is a small restaurant with tables so close to one another that it's not only  difficult to move around but it is challenging to have an intimate dinner with those you love. The portions and price ratio are somewhat outrageous! (Small, dinky portions and it costs a lot!) Can't say I was too pleased with my time here.

In my personal opinion, this place is overrated. My friend had glorified this place like no other and even the yelp ratings confirmed his love for this place. Unfortunately, I can't say the same :(. I expected this place to be so very close to how the yakitori places are in Japan. This place definitely falls short. 

Despite my disappointment, I must say, I was impressed by the quality and the menu. However, for the price and atmosphere, I don't see this as a worthy place to dine in. We ended up getting a few skewers of meat; I know we got the wagyu beef which definitely stood out, the tofu (the best thing I had on this menu) and grilled tako. No bueno on that grilled tako; I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber chicken that was burnt flavored. Blah! I honestly don't know why this place is highly rated; it's between ""good"" and ""ok"" but it isn't ""OMG this place is the s**t!""

I really tried to love this place. I tried to accept and tried to convince myself that I'm paying for high quality food, but seriously, this place is almost an insult. I had to stop at $85 worth of food because I wasn't sure how much I would need to spend to feel full and satisfied. I'm sad I wasted my hard earned money here and couldn't give my boyfriend an awesome birthday dinner. Vegas needs to step up their game on authentic yakitori places.

PS. if you decide you want to go to Raku, I suggest not walking in as you are unlikely to get a table as a walk in. So make sure you try and get a reservation...",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,8,0,2,SldG488lAPHKZy-CnkB6xA

1680684,2015-03-25,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"The food at Raku was amaaazing. It's unlike any other Japanese restaurant I've ever been. When even making reservations two weeks ahead for a Saturday evening, I couldn't even get the time I wanted. We had to settle for a 10:30pm reservation, which is fine because they still take reservations as late as 1am. 

My friends and I shared lots of things, so in a way, you could treat it like tapas, but everything was a la carte. 

Raku Tofu: The best thing about this dish was not only the creamy texture of the house made tofu, but how much one thing like tofu can change tastes. Our waiter advised that we try the tofu with the condiments on the table. Tofu + green tea matcha salt = delicious. Add it with their house soy sauce, the bonito flakes, finely grated ginger = even more delicious. I wanted to steal that small canister of green tea salt.

Foie Gras Egg Custard: This was my favorite item of the night. This is basically ""chawan mushi"" but elevated with the foie gras flavor. I know foie gras isn't for everyone but it's got that pungent umami finish. If I ever go back, I'd get this for myself. No sharing. 

Poached Egg with Uni and Salmon Roe: This dish looked pretty until we were told to mix it up. I thought it was ok. It's got a sticky consistency from the poached egg which is slightly raw. I don't have a problem with the texture and flavors, but I was easily annoyed by how difficult it is to eat and enjoy with wooden spoons. 

The grilled skewers weren't bad. Again, a la carte, so they're about anywhere from $4+ each.

Mushroom and Bacon: I was surprised by this because it seemed like a regular button mushroom. However, the flavors together were amazing. Salty and juicy at once.

Kobe Beef with Garlic: This was decent for Kobe beef. I was just happy that it wasn't overcooked.

Kobe Beef Liver: I know this one isn't for everyone, but I liked it. It reminded me more of pig's blood because of it's cubed shape on the skewer and it has that ""iron"" taste to it, but the chewy consistency confirmed it was definitely liver.

Langostine: This was off the daily special menu. They're huge prawns, or mini-lobsters. A single one is about $30. While i didn't have any, I was told that the langostine tasted sweet. 

If I ever come back to Raku, I'd love to do the omakase which ranges from $75 to 100. And with a side of the foie gras egg custard. 

Service was ok. They didn't seem overtly friendly, but they were patient with us. In retrospect, the food does come out a bit slow, but it's at a good pace to enjoy everything. I'd love, love, love to come back.",3SGQKsO1J-jcRIp3WNxCeA,2,3,5,1n2-0lARsaQvjj_wp23o7g

Okay, okay, it's not really secret, but I love calling unlisted menu options ""secret"".  I like pretend that I'm part of a secret foodie society of delicious food.  My first visit a couple years back was perfect.  This last visit just solidified how amazing Raku can be in terms of the consistency and quality of its food.  It also helps that the service is always very efficient and friendly.

For omakase, there are three tiers to choose from $50/$75/$125.  Being that it was it was for his birthday, I decided to go middle baller style - $75!

1.  Saba/Mackerel Sashimi - Mackerel doesn't have the same reputation of its fatty counterpart of Oh Toro, but leave it to Raku to take it up to to the highest notch of freshness.  Just a tiny dab of wasabi and the tiniest dab of their house made soy sauce was the perfect combination of flavor.
2.  Sashimi Salad with baby spinach, salmon, yellowtail - The best sashimi salad ever because the fish was perfectly fresh, the spinach perfectly crisp, the soy sauce dressing combined with deep fried onions (?) was texturally and flavor wise on point!
3.  House Tofu (Chilled) with side of bonito flakes - We had this with a little bit of green tea infused salt.  This was our least favorite of the night because we usually like our tofu with sauce, so it was a little dry for our tastes.  However, for a purist tofu lover, this is probably a good dish to have this was pure soy goodness.
4.  Clams - These were simply cooked in a clay pot.  They were a bit on the salty side, but I definitely enjoyed the seafood enfused essence of the clam broth.
5.  Unagi Salted and Unagi with light glaze of kabayaki sauce - Raku has introduced me to the true form of unagi.  I think that I've been eating poor representations of unagi slathered in way too much kabayaki sauce, but this time I know I had the real thing!  The dish consisted of delicately grilled fresh water eel, one side lightly salted, one side lightly glazed in kabayaki sauce.  Fantastic.
6. Charcoal grill items (Mushroom skewers, Juicy chicken skewers, Pork cheek skewers, Kobe Beef skewers) - Premium ingredients with smoky flavors and not an ounce of dryness or chewiness!
7. Agedashi Tofu - This is our favorite at Raku, and it did not disappoint.  It is their house made tofu deep fried and presented in their broth.
8. Raspberry Sorbet - I'm usually not a fruity flavor dessert kind of gal unless it's fresh cut fruit, so I definitely did not enjoy this to the fullest.  The sorbet was more icy than smooth, but definitely had some intense raspberry flavor.

I bookedmarked this place a few months ago and was looking for a snack at 11:30PM. Good thing this place opens so late. No wait for bar seating on late  Thursday night. Reviewed the menu and chose a few snacks.

Chicken Thigh $2.75 for 1 skewer [5 of 5] - Delicious and juicy chicken meat. Very tender and had this nice charcoal smell. It was perfectly roasted. 
Kurobuta Pork Cheek $4.25 for 1 skewer [5 of 5] - Delicious and juicy pork meat. The slice of roast meat was sensational.
Kobe Beef Tendon $3.50 for 1 skewer [4 of 5] - First time having roast tendon and it was delicious. The charrrrr taste and gooey tendon was wonderful. It is a little different from the typical meats, but worth trying. I really enjoyed it, but I also enjoy tendon.
Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup $18 [4 of 5] - Interesting concept. Fusing the foie gras into a custard. Then pouring light soy sauce into the custard to serve as the cold udon dipping sauce. I liked the idea, but the custard didn't physically work well as a dipping sauce. I think the pieces separately work better - foie gras custard and a simple cold udon with a light and sweet dipping soy sauce. As a side note, the place used skinny udon noodle, which was very clever for dipping. 
Green Tea Crème Brulée $6 [4 of 5] - Presented with creme brulee and ice cream. It was matcha heaven. Very enjoyable and rather delightful size for $6. 

This place was cute. I wish I was more hungry so I could try more items from the menu.

Long-braised pork belly appetizer with a bit of freshly mixed hot mustard. Served in the cooking liquid, and it was heavenly. The fat was barely solid, and melted into a sauce the moment my tongue disturbed it.

Skewers, priced from $2 to $16. Many less expensive are great, including the very simple asparagus skewer with a very understated, slightly sweet sauce. Bacon-wrapped inoki mushrooms are not only filled with umami from the fungus, but also impossibly pretty. Kurobuta pork cheek was sweet, lean, and had a deep pork taste.

juicy deep fried chicken - heavenly!!!  i don't know how they cook this, but it's the most moist deep fried chicken ever!!!  and the fried skin around it just makes everything ridiculously good... and of course the spinach with dressing only adds to the flavor and the experience... definitely my favorite!

i also absolutely loved their restroom... the decor creates an ambiance!  everyone must visit the restroom... 

things that were good:
kobe beef w/ garlic - it was good... definite quality!

duck w/ balsamic soy sauce - it's different than typical duck.. almost didn't taste like duck.. it was tasty!
mushroom w/ bacon - anything w/ bacon is good... need i say more?
green apple cocktail - it was good, sweet... almost like green apple martini but couldn't taste the alcohol

things that were interesting:
fluffy cheesecake - consistency of whipped cream cheese... kind of good, but my taste palate was confused because it didn't taste quite like cheesecake... it was very smooth, tasted better w/ green tea powder... not sure if i liked it or not... 
tangerine orange sorbet - it was like shaved iced w/ orange syrup.. it was refreshing and tasty but once again, not what i expected of sorbet...

Visited in a party of 4 early in the evening.  I have to say, their menu is pretty big.  Hard to make a decision on what to have .. so we went with most of the items on their special menu.

The handmade tofu is delicious.  We tried both the raw & fried tofu.  Delicious.  We had a clam soup which was really salty.  But what really took away stars was our Miso Kobe Beef.  The cook over cooked the Kobe which made it tough.  Really tough.  And not just once.  But twice.  Yup, ordered two orders which came out about 10 minutes apart.  Both tougher than rubber.
Who over cooks Kobe beef at $13+ for 4 small cubes.

My husband does not like tofu, which I like but do not love. However, after all the positive comments we decided to give it a try and OMG! This was something totally different to any other tofu I ever tried. My husband even loved it, which was even more surprising. So soft, so delicate and the waiter told us how to eat: first with their special salt with green tea: delicious. And then he told us to tried with the other ingredients included in the plate: bonito flakes, ginger and their homemade soy sauce. Unbelievable!
We ordered what turned out to be a lot for the 2 of us: Popeye salad, Kobe beef skewer with wasabi, foie gras with soy sauce, lamb skewer, fried asparagus, grilled rice balls, ear pigs (looked disgusting it hubby loved them).

1779191,2014-05-04,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"This tapas styled restaurant has some exquisite reviews and we can understand why.

First of all, the place is on the pricier side.  Don't be fooled by the modest prices listed on the menu because the portions are tiny and the price is per individual item.  For example, the DELICIOUS Kobe filet kabob with wasabi is 12 bucks for 1 skewer!  Unless you want to share one small skewer with your date, you will need to purchase at least 2.  

Secondly, it would be a smart idea to obtain a reservation because you will have to wait a long time if you attempt to walk in.  We walked in the minute they opened at 6pm in order to secure a spot.  We were seated next to the hostess and you won't believe the douchebags who try to weasel their way into getting a table without a reservation...I think i've heard all excuses/tricks in the book.  Everything from the typical ""hows it going bro"" approach to someone claiming that they have a reservation the following day and wanted to check the place out today.  That guy was caught in his own web of lies, trying to spit out an answer when the host asked him what the name and time was on the reservation haha.

The food is definitely phenomenal, made with care.  Everything we ordered was solid.

- Kobe fillet skewers with wasabi.  Tender beef skewer with a thin line of wasabi, giving it just enough kick.  Great hint of charcoal flavor.

- Enoki Mushrooms wrapped in bacon.  Love this one.  I love the fact that the bacon didn't fall apart.  Expertly prepared.

- cherry tomato wrapped in bacon.  Anything wrapped in bacon tastes great

- Lamb chop.  The sauce was phenomenal...sweet, yet a hint of the japanese charcoal grill flavor.

- Fried chicken.  The presentation is pretty solid.  Chicken breast meat prepared to look like a sushi roll.  Skin on chicken tastes great.

- Fluffy cheesecakes.  This was definitely our favorite dessert.  They must have some kind of magical mixer that can blend the ingredients so it tastes fluffy, yet dense enough to remind me of the cheesecake consistency

- Green Tea creme brule.  This is pretty solid as well.  Not too sweet.

Even though we gave this place 4 stars, I don't think we will be back unless we have some out of town friends who love unique japanese cuisine.  Its a little pricey and there's too many places that provide similar foodie satisfaction at half the price in Vegas.",ACZauHUxS5MXq7_RTDDppQ,2,0,4,oklcAaD7l9Zu9a1e-9jSPA

They did really good in the skewer. We ordered Asajime chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, Kurobuta pork cheek, and
Enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon. Chicken breast with skin is juicy, which is better than my expectation. The pork cheek is a must order.

1791301,2015-06-19,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"This a review solely on the Omakese experience. 

First things first the food is exquisite and the presentation is amazing but for the price the 'experience' falls short.

Food: I believe that the Omakese had seven courses. It was a mix of the daily specials and the menu. The food was great highlights were the amazing sashimi selection and a scallop perfectly done in a Dashi sauce. Lowlight included a cherry tomato skewer and a fish soup that really didn't build on any of the other dishes. Great green tea Crete brûlée.

Pricing: there was a 75/100 price for the Omakese. The 100 has premium ingredients. For example in ours we had some caviar added to oyster. Tasted like the sea. I loved it. Couldn't determine what the other ""premium"" items were. I would have liked to know so as to determine that we actually made a decent choice.

Service: service is nice but a bit brisk. Polite not welcoming, didn't give a great description of the difference b/w 75 and 100 pricing. Also the quality of food description varied greatly between servers.

Experience: for dropping $300+ after drink and tip, the experience fell short. We felt very rushed, like I was in a race to eat because the subsequent plates were coming before being done w/ the current plates so we couldn't really enjoy and relax. Check was brought at same time as dessert without asking about how we liked it or wanted a last drink. It was as if they clearly wanted to get the table open as quickly as possible. While I get that they are busy, if one is dropping that cash and waiting two weeks for reservations that could have been better.

Conclusion: the food is great and the reputation is well earned as a culinary destination. There are unique and beautiful dishes here. The staff is nice despite being busy. That being said if we ever went back we would definitely order off the menu to our own pace so we could relax and enjoy a little more.",jcThqp8nGqJNsyxUcl4_kg,2,0,3,3RU39DlPG_pfNFGQLKNEGw

We ordered a la carte, since I already knew what I wanted to try.

We had:
- housemade tofu:  as everyone mentioned, worth trying to see what the texture and flavor of fresh  made tofu is like.  I grew up in Korea where we had a tofu man come by our house every afternoon selling fresh made tofu, so I know how good handmade tofu can be.  I can't say this was as good, but better than anything else I've had in the States.
- kobe liver sashimi: obviously not for everyone, but if you're a fan of liver, I'd recommend.  It comes with a slice of garlic and you dip it in sesame oil.
- foie gras chawanmushi:  Excellent.  Loved every bite.
- agedashi tofu:  Very good, no complaints.
- kobe beef tendon: I'm a fan of tendon, so it was as I expected.  Chewy and tasty.
- kanpachi sashimi:  very fresh.  Love kanpachi.
- foie gras on skewers:  Very good, I like Kinjiro's in LA, but it was good here too.
- soboro don:  Not my favorite.  
- my favorite dish of the night and why I gave it 5 stars, poached egg/uni/ikura/okura/Japanese mountain yam:  Loved this!  I love everything in this bowl, and I just love that they had this on their menu.

Overall, it's a restaurant I'd frequent if it was in LA, and lo and behold, they do have one in LA!  I need to try it in LA to make sure it is as good as it is in Vegas.

I was in town for a show at the Brooklyn Bowl, and the restaurants on the strip were simply not doing it for me. I was starving. My boy was starving. We were in Vegas's Chinatown, tirelessly searching Yelp for the best dining options, without success. We were almost ready to give up, but by a stroke of luck, we stumbled across this little Izakaya tucked into a low-key Chinatown plaza (well, actually, we erroneously walked into Raku Sweets before stumbling into Raku, but I digress). Little did I know I'd be walking into one of my favorite Vegas spots ever. 

We weren't too lucky at the tables that night, but we were pretty lucky in scoring bar seats almost immediately upon arrival. This was awesome because 1) this restaurant is usually quite busy and requires a reservation 2) we sat at the same bar seats as Anthony Bourdain and his dining partner during his Parts Unknown Vegas episode! I didn't realize this fun fact until after I watched the episode, but I thought it was neat. Anyways, service was on point, but the food is what really shines. Here's a few things we ordered:

Agedashi tofu: Really, really good. Probably the best tofu I've had in my life. It's house-made, silky tofu in an absolutely delicious broth, garnished with seaweed, roe. One of the best things I've ordered here hands down. 

Asparagus with bacon: Flavorful and decadent. Perfect amount of char from the grill

Enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon: Great texture from the mushrooms, and again..thumbs up for bacon-wrapped anything

Kurabuta pork cheek: Melts in your mouth

Kobe beef with garlic: Beef was nice and tender, and the garlic chip was perfectly roasted. But in comparison to the other dishes, it wasn't my favorite

Butter-sauteed Scallop: Really fresh and perfectly tender on the inside.

Along with a few beers, the bill was well under a hundred dollars, and we were both perfectly stuffed for the evening. We also got some sort of salad appetizer on the house, which was very nice. Can't wait to dine here again.",TxWBHR4WE4BmIRtlgFYaWg,1,1,5,odUTJlQ66HhSycBbZomoUg

Reservations is a must. This place is off the strip, but so worth the uber/lyft ride. The GPS will probably take you to Raku Sweets, their dessert bar, which is a few doors away. I think the food is decently priced and meets my cravings for authentic and good Japanese fares. 

One of our friends is vegetarian and even though there aren't too many options on the menu for him, they were attentive to let us now which dishes come with bonito flakes (fish) and condiments (green salt) with meat-products. He thoroughly enjoyed his grilled asparagus, grilled okra, and most definitely, the homemade tofu!

We all loved the homemade tofu and never had tofu like this before. Making it in-house really makes a difference in the taste and texture. We got the Raku's tofu without the bonito flakes and oyaji tofu with the amazing chili sauce. We loved that chili sauce so much that we asked our server about it. Apparently, we can get it at any Japanese grocery store and that's what we will be doing when we return home. 

Several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed include enoki mushrooms with bacon, poached egg with uni, kikusui (their specialty fish), asajime chicken, hamachi belly, kobe beef liver sashimi, and fluffy cheese cake.

The agedashi tofu was excellent and the best I've ever had and i've had a lot of them. Really delicious.

I also had the grilled rice balls (miso and soya sauce). The miso one was quite good but the soya one felt a bit dry on the outside and didn't taste much.

The grilled tomatoes were pretty good and had a very strong BBQ taste to them which my wife loved. idem for the asparagus.

The corn and potato dish was good, but nothing special.

I had a good sake that tasted very light and fruity and complimented the food very well. I normally don't like sake (and alcohol in general) but this one, I liked. It's the first one on the sake menu under the 30% section.

I might have had a couple of other things but I forget...

I had an 8pm reservation and got there about 10 minutes early.  They seated us right away.

The food was excellent as expected.  It does take a long time to complete the meal since there is some waiting between courses.  Usually the wait is between 5-10 minutes but it can be as long as 20 minutes so hopefully you have some good company.

Raku is great from the moment you walk in.  First you feel like you're in a 100% authentic Japanese restaurant. The servers, the cooks, the small intimate atmosphere.  It all feels very different from most American restaurants and in a very good way. 

The menu has a lot of options, but it's not overwhelming. Nothing I've ever chosen has been disappointing. And the prices range from incredibly affordable tapas (as low as $3) to very expensive premium saki. 

The saki menu is very large and informative. It was very fun to read about the choices. In the end, I prefer the house-made hot saki. It takes them about 10-15min to prepare it for you, but it's super affordable and delicious!

The meatball and mushroom dish is a bit pricey, but it's my favorite (and I almost always dislike mushrooms). It's excellent.

Even eating seconds of the in house made TOFU. This is thee best tofu I have ever eaten in my life. They make this gree tea salt to put on it that sit on your table. Wow! The kobe wasabi skewers so good. The duck is my personal favorite. Also the bacon wrapped tomotoes and mushrooms to die for. Garlic skirt steak, fried chicken, chicken thighs, foie gras custard, yellow fin tuna ( we ordered 3 of these) and the only thing we did not finish immediately was the anchovie salad. We also ordered all 3 desserts which I highly recommend! This is a serious must eat, one of the only restaraunts that fly their fish in fresh daily. Incredible. Can not wait to come back. We also ordered 2 50-60 dollar bottles of wine and ordered nearly everything on the menu besides the specials and the bill was only 300. Try doing that any where else.

By far, the best part of the meal was the love skewers! It was like making love!!!!! Soooo much flavor and very tender. 

To be honest... everything else tastes bland. The king crab was grilled and didn't taste like crab, the sashimi was dry (no ponzu) and pork belly.... is just too much to handle! Basically I was still hungry leaving this place. I wish the chef asked what we were interested in eating and you would've told him... food with flavor!

We started with the sashimi salad which had really fresh, delicious fish, and a nice spicy miso that you could mix in for that perfect level of spice.  Next we had the Yellowtail carpaccio - also fantastic.  Next, butter scallop cooked in the shell, which might be my favorite scallop I've ever had.  Cooked perfectly with a great flavor and texture.  Next we had the gizzard yakitori which had an amazing charcoal flavor (as did all the yakitori).  It was still good, but probably my least favorite dish of the night.  Then we had the crispy chicken (like a roulade) and it was delicious.   Perfectly fried on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Next up was the kurobuta pork cheek yakitori which had a great blend of charcoal and savory fat flavor.  Then the duck yakitori which was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  Cooked perfectly with a nice soy based glaze, it packed a ton of flavor.  Then we had the agedashi tofu which, even though I'm not a huge tofu fan, was pretty spectacular.  I would definitely order it again.  And last, but not least, we had the pork belly, which while amazing in every sense of the word, finished us off because it was so rich.   The japanese mustard on top was a nice tough though as it helped cut the richness just a bit.

It's tucked away in one of the ""Chinatown"" strip malls on Spring Mountain.  Unassuming at best, nestled on the corner across from a smoke shop.

Definitely call ahead for reservations.  We called and they were fully booked but said we could come down and try.  They don't turn away Walk-ins, as long as you're willing to wait up to an hour you can get seated.

I really came here with foie gras on mind.  I've missed you my rich, indulgent fatty little bastard...off of a robata grill no less.  Everything came off with that wonderful charcoal taste that you'll be burping up later to remind you how awesome your meal was.

My favorites enjoyed with a few bottles of Ginga Kogen:
- Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce
- Foie Gras Don
- Kobe Beef Tendon
- Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe
- Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi
- Scallops served sashimi style (daily special)

I was only really disappointed with the Yellowtail as they came out a bit dry and overcooked.

All in all one of my favorite places now in Vegas.  Although if I were not feenin for that foie gras, I would definitely hit up another favorite spot down the street, Ichiza, for some more traditional izakaya.

1912448,2014-08-29,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I usually don't write any reviews, however Raku has really disappointed me this time. I have been the biggest promoter of Raku ever since its opening. My family usually has our family functions at the restaurant so when my friend, who has been living in Japan for many years and recently moved to UK, came to visit, I decided to take him and his friends to the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Vegas.

I have never been so disappointed by the customer service by the guy manager. He never smiled, and only gave yes, or a resounding no, or only nodding for answers, even when I asked for recommendations or special menu. Working in customer service, I understand that people can have a bad day, seeing that my friend is already frowning at the service we were getting, I tried to lighten up the mood by trying to have some small talks (""your restaurant looked so busy tonight."") The manager only rolled his eyes and fixed his attention back to the floor. 

Having lived in Japan and been a loyal customer to Raku for the past so many years, I admit that I have higher expectations of Raku than any regular restaurants. However, this time, Raku really had let me down. Even my friend, who was first time to the restaurant, was commenting that the customer service is not even on par with any Japanese restaurants that he would expect.

Another example, when we asked for special menu, he disappeared for a whole ten minutes, when he came back, he slammed the blackboard on the table and very impatiently listed the items on the menu  without explaining what they were. When we asked for fork and knife, he did not even acknowledge and we had to remind him twice before he came back with them. By that time, the dish was already cold under the AC. 

I felt like I was such an inconvenience to the manager instead of enjoying a meal with a friend that I haven't seen for years. To make things even worse, we saw that the manager was laughing and proactively introducing the menu, the Specials, taking care of their drinks (refills) to another table of customers. I not only felt not being appreciated as a customer, but also discriminated for nothing.

I don't think the Raku I dined at tonight was the same restaurant Endo San had envisioned. Both my friends and I were appalled that this gentleman was put in charge as the manager of the spot. While he was expected to teach the other servers to deliver an amazing meal to the customers, he did completely the opposite and ruined our night. I sincerely recommend him to look for a job outside of customer service and hospitality.",M2whdwvMtNxLllxOvt7cOw,6,0,1,jnxZ-R0SiaYXPmNY7rkVew

Appetizers
Raku's Tofu: worth at least trying, great silky texture
Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi: there's no getting around the strong liver taste, it's not for everyone. The roasted garlic chips add flavor and texture.
Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard: great dish, minimal foie but still very enjoyable. There was also some roe in this that we hadn't expected.
Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe: This dish wasn't for me at all. I like poached eggs, and urchin, and roe, but this didn't come together and the egg was closer to raw than poached.
Juicy Deep Fried Chicken: an incredible introduction to the wonderful chicken dishes Raku's kitchen puts out, even the spinach garnish was delicious

Rice & Noodle
Grilled Rice Ball in Broth with Salmon: Great pick. Light broth that tasted more like a tea due to the steeped seaweed in the dish. Rice retains the grilled texture despite being soaked in broth. Salmon surcharge was $3 but piece of fish was the size of a thumb nail, didn't contribute anything to the flavor.

Robata
Chicken Thigh & Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin: the chicken robata dishes were my favorites, with a smoky grilled taste and juicy beyond belief
Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi: the beef was good, but I'm not a fan of wasabi so that kind of ruined this for me
Kobe Beef Tendon: nope. not happening. too adventurous for me.
Pork Ear: Tasty with lots of texture. Server recommends their spicy table sauce, which was basically a punch of straight-up pepper. I'd recommend it without.
Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce: Ordered two of these knowing I'd love it, and I did. Lacked the gamey taste that turns a lot of people off to duck. Good choice.
Tomato with Bacon & Mushroom with Bacon: I'm not generally a bacon fan, but adding a veggie into the mix somehow does it for me. 

Dessert
Fluffy Cheesecake: I'm not a dessert fan, and found this a bit too cheesy for me, but when you get to the raspberry filling? Oh man, all bets are off. 

Above meal was under $200 with a carafe of Ashahi ($30) and tip, and enough for three to share happily. Service was just okay, polite and professional but detached and didn't make a connection or any recommendations even when we mentioned it was our first visit. Make sure to take at least one trip to the bathroom, it's beautiful.

We made reservations a few days in advance, and staff were awesome about calling us back when they were unable to pick up. Reservations secure your table for 15 minutes (show up on time!), and you get the table for 2 hours.

Ok I know, MAKE A RESERVATION NOW, you have to make a reservation, I came to Vegas for two days and I am leaving sad as sad can be for not being able to go back I really wanted to get the Omakase this time and let the chef surprise me.

This place is a hidden gem in Vegas, I have been in Raku more than 10 times in my life and I will keep coming back to it, let me explain:

There are few food in the world that can make me happy, seafood is definitively my favorite kind, but at RAKU seafood is my least concern, I love every single item I have tried here, except for UNI I do not like UNI anywhere, let me try to explain what I feel when I put a piece of the Glaze Duck in my mouth...orgasm, that's the word, then the Kobe beef with garlic enters the already excited mouth and plays a symphony in my taste buds, only Beethoven could do it better, the Kurobuta Pork Cheek is delicious, my wifes favorite are the pork ears, we love the Enoki mushrooms wraped in bacon, pretty much anything we tried we truly loved, my palate experiences many many sensations during the meal, ranging from mouth orgasms, to symphonies, heavenly pieces of angel wings to deception, yes the deception of feeling full, my brain asks for more but my stomach asks for control, I could only wish we were in the Roman era again...this place is one of my top restaurants in my list, why? I don't know but I could care less, I will keep coming back as they keep feeding me with the same quality as always.

If I could marry you Raku, I would, sadly for you I am already in a relationship, I would make you feel special every night.

Note: The best and easiest $160 for three people I have ever spent.",QSClcmT-qFIGtl1U4csfYg,1,0,5,aYdg0IWhXBj1ODmqwWlmGg
1936738,2009-11-09,7,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Amy C. I must thank you.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You were the last droplets of water in my canteen that got me across the desert and showed me safe passage through Las Vegas, and helped me avoid the massive amount buffet food and pricey celebrity chef endorsed restaurants that line the strip.  I never expected to find, Japanese food that would not only cure my cravings, but also cure my homesickness of living out of a suitcase in a hotel.

We ordered quite a bit of items, and reviewing my photos, we came  pretty close to about 17 dishes between the three of us, and boy we left full!  I enjoyed each dish that came out but I will highlight a few that were so good, that they almost knocked me out of my seat. 

The Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe was from the cold appetizer section, what more could you ask for, three eggs from three different animals are in this dish, throw in nameko mushrooms, and thin slices of okra in a light soy based sauce, you get a dish with an amazing texture.  I'm sure it the type of texture that can horrify some people who aren't used to it, because of the slimy texture that all these ingredients bring to the table, but just by pouring this on our rice, the flavors, the textures it all worked.  I grew up with this texture, and I was instantly swept up in waves of nostalgia from my childhood as I ate this dish.  I loved this dish.

The Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth, agedashi dofu is another dish that I love.  And I've had great ones, and quite a few not so great ones, but this one was delicious, it had the consistency and texture you can only get from homemade tofu, additionally, they choose to keep it in a larger block rather then to cut it into smaller cubes for the purpose of allowing you to actually be able to taste the tofu, with the crispy fried batter, swimming in a tentsuyu broth with green onion, salmon roe and nameko mushrooms.  

Yaki onigiri was great and I liked how they did the traditional soy sauce one, but then did another one sandwiched in between shiso leaves and a little miso paste.  The only little critique I had on the soy sauce one was I wished they cooked it on the robata grill a little longer, I do like to getting a little char on it and I love to munch on the little crispy bits of rice on my onigiri.  But that is just a personal preference of mine.  

Grilled Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce - The duck was perfectly cooked, it had a little color inside and the balsamic soy sauce provided a nice seasoning and acidity to the dish.

Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi - I had this in a few steakhouses back in Japan.  It took me back.

Potato with Corn - This dish perplexed me and all of my dinner companions.  It was delicious, but more so we were in deep conversation during the consumption of this and for the duration of our trip, ""How in the world did he do this?""  We have a couple of ideas in principal, but how the person who did this and executed it so flawlessly, we are honestly still at a loss.  I think just order it, try it and you will see what we were on about. 

For dessert we the sorbet flavors of the day, they had a Mandarin Sorbet and Watermelon Sorbet.  I would probably have to say that their sorbet had larger ice crystals, (leading to a texture more similar to a granita siciliana) compared to a sorbet which has smaller ice crystals creating a much smoother texture.  Definitions of texture aside, both sorbets were very good and was a nice way to cleanse the pallet.  We also ordered the Meltin' and Creamy Chocolate Cake, on our server's recommendation, they make this one to order and they need at least 15-20 minutes to make this dessert, we were in no rush, we were enjoying our meal.  It was basically a molten chocolate cake, and with our first cut with the spoon, it gushed out.  The cake was dense and moist, with the molten fudge inside, and a little green tea ice cream, which complemented the dessert.

Overall, I wouldn't have expected to find a restaurant like this all the way out in Vegas.  We came for a late dinner, so we had no line, but now that I know that they serve food like this, it's going to be worth the wait.  Now if you are the type of person where the words ""all you can eat"" or ""the world's biggest"" sounds appealing, I'm not sure this is the place for you.  But if you like a little variety, and enjoy eating in a tapas style (little plates), believe me, you will leave here full and very satisfied... added bonus you don't have to win big in Vegas to eat here, prices for what you get are extremely reasonable.  

This hidden gem, requires a car or taxi to get off the beaten path in Las Vegas but it was worth the effort.  I can't wait to go back.  (I already have a wish list on things I want to try next time....)

Raku's tofu with their house made salt is a must order. Eat half with the salt on the table and the other half with the ginger, bonito flakes and house made soy sauce on the table. It's so simple but so amazing. The texture is like whipped tofu with a sweet cream finish. 
Another must order is the foie gras custard and yakitori. I am a huge foie fan and this is perfect way to eat it two ways. The yakitori way is simply grilled topped with a wonderful sauce similar to fig and a truffle is added. Delicious! One order is enough for two since it is quite rich and they are generous with their portions. The custard which takes some time is amazing and topped with smoked duck. If you only have two people don't order the duck yakitori and have it on the custard. 
The pork cheek and beef tendons are the classic yakitori you must order. The tendons are chewy but soft and slightly smoky. I had two orders myself :) the hubs loves the pork cheek which was grilled to perfection. It was fatty and light and no sinews. He had two of them to himself. 
Check the specials and don't order the sushi. Yakitori is what they are known for so go crazy and order away. We've had most of the menu (minus daily specials) and these are just the must have's.",r0E8c6_4AOP1NW6eSXT_ig,3,1,5,diZQc4KxpXMQGV6XVZKQTQ

My wife and I came in with a open mind. They have a pretty extensive menu and portions are small which is awesome because it gets us to try many dishes. I really enjoyed their tofu dish. They make it fresh every day. Prices for dishes are are pretty reasonable for the amount of dishes you get.

It's a hidden gem about 3 miles from the strip and in a very unassuming strip mall with a cramp parking lot BUT very worth it. You'll see the Raku sweets shop a little closer to the street and the main Raku along the back part. It's a small little place but the staff is welcoming (they shout a Japanese welcome to almost every patron that walks in). Although not the quickest service I have ever had the food was phenomenal.

We decided to just order a lot of options so let me run through some: first, we order some of the bluefin sashimi special and hello - yes please I could have had 12 more. So good, so tender, so tasty! We also got the homemade tofu, miso soup, chicken with chicken skin, asparagus wrapped in bacon, tomatoes wrapped in bacons and Kobe beef with garlic. BUT the best part of the new by far was the scallops, okra and yellowfin. All so so delicious, left me wanting more! 

The scallop though - it came in a delectable butter sauce which made me wish I had a piece of bread to soak up the sauce. It was heavenly. 

All in all - a great place to explore to when visiting Vegas and wanting a meal away from the strip. I'm sad I only captured one photo - but it was of the scallop so it's ok. 

Side note - my coworker ordered the ginger ale. It is ""normal"" ginger ale so the taste of real ginger (spicy) is very evident. Just a warning!",L8Euta_K7ZDA5iwBHDyhbA,2,3,5,gUH4V2CyPV2DPtOh6LwHsQ

Their supposed Popular Dish:

Homemade Tofu 1/2 cold and 1/2 fried:

- the cold tofu was OK to say the least. Soft textured that held together and flavorless. But adding some green onion and minced ginger that came on the side, sprinkled some of their green tea salt and poured some housemade soy sauce that gave it some life.

 - the fried tofu was much better and I would definitely order this again! It came half submerged in a nicely balanced soy/tempura type broth, topped with caviar (I believe), dried seaweed strips, chopped green onion and a side smudge of Japanese chili paste/sauce. The saltiness of the caviar with the mildness of the broth made a delightful combination with the delicate consitency of the tofu. Exquisite Dish!!

From the Robata Grill: 

* The following orders were bite sized pieces stabbed in skewers 

Chicken Breast with Chicken Skin wrapped around it:  white chicken meat with slightly crispy skin. Tasted as expected but didn't expect it to be tiny sized.

Tomato with Bacon: tiny tomatoes wapped with slightly cooked bacon. Not bad and Not Special.

Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce: smelled sinful, richness of duck camoflauged by balsamic and soy sauce, cooked right with a char flavor.. Pretty good.

Kurobuta Pork Cheek: Porky Tasty, tad oily and fatty.. A winner in my book!

Drinks:

Piping Hot Tea (came at the end of the meal): nice way to cleanse the palate and end the night.

1971286,2013-05-24,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku was the highlight of my dining experiences in Sin City. I don't know where to begin...

Many things are made in-house (green tea salt, anyone?). The creamy silky tofu topped with fish skins and scallions, which we were advised to have with their homemade soy sauce, was so simple yet delicious. Meat lovers and non-tofu fans kept going back for more. The sushi...I'll come back to that in a minute.

The girls and I opted for their fifty dollar omakase menu, rationalizing that we could add on more items, if we wanted more food. Fifty dollars provided us with a splendid feast that I felt was totally worth the money. I can only imagine how wonderful the $75 and $100 menus must be. 

Just so you know, the food is served family style. I thought we were going to get small, individual plates of each of the ten courses. Nope, you'll be sharing large platters of the different dishes with your tablemates. Provided that your dining companions are considerate and good about sharing, this arrangement should work fine.

Our first course was phenomenal; I drool as I think of what to tell you next. We were delighted with the freshest, most beautiful cuts of fish. This is easily one of the most delectable pieces of sushi I've ever laid eyes upon and had the pleasure of sampling. As with all other dishes, the servers provided us with instruction on how to enjoy the dish-showing us the order in which to eat the fish, the toppings to add, and the palate cleanser on the plate. In many cases, I feel people don't get the full joy of eating a certain dish because they aren't eating it right. Raku makes sure you don't commit this fatal error.

This superior quality sushi meant that soy sauce was not needed. It would be a travesty, an insult to douse any of these beautiful cuts with the dark sauce. Taken alone or with a little wasabi and you were good to go.

The tofu as I already mentioned was quite satisfying and tasty. Their teriyaki fish was yummy, but not the greatest of all the courses. The fish served in its own broth, head-on was also very, very good. And the magic they created with these grilled tomatoes, served on skewers-had all the girls sighing with happiness. There were two dishes I didn't get to try: chicken wings and grilled beef. My friends said they were tasty, though maybe not the standouts of the 10-course meal.The high-quality rice with fish roe and bits of salmon was pleasing to me, but a bit too plain for the others. Our omakase dinner was, however, mostly a five-star experience.

Before exiting, I learned that Raku's chef was nominated for a James Beard Award, and I can definitely see why. Raku is one of many reasons to venture off the Strip, and arguably one of the biggest reasons to do so.",UhzrTq9-Sggy1SHkSY4Unw,4,2,5,aL9NZp456SF_sk0Fb31YZQ

The dishes are earthy handmade Japanese ceramics,  the use of wood, tile, and every element is used in a way that brings out  its basic nature.  I sat at the sushi bar and met some regulars, who told me that owner designed and built the restaurant himself,  from the tables to the tiles. The food is also part of the art, every dish beautifully presented, every flavor clear and bright.
I started with the tofu salad. Although I am not too fond of tofu, this was tofu of another sort. Handmade by the owner/chef, and with a richness and depth of flavor that made it as delicious as the best mozzarella fresco sliced between perfect tomatoes.  Every course that followed was stellar. Many were tiny tastes, like a cut skewered asparagus spear wrapped in bacon and grilled. Each was the most perfected use of the ingredients imaginable.
The lovely staff seemed at bit surprised at how popular their little place has become. I found out about it from the NY Times, they had just had a glowing review in the Washington Post.

Our first dish of live langostino sashimi was outstanding, and then they took the body and claws and made them into a wonderfully flavorful Miso soup.  We then tried on of their classic dishes of enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon which was a unique experience.  Next, we had the black Sea Bass two ways - grilled (by itself) and fried (in a dashi broth) which was one of the best fish dishes we have ever had.  Simple preparation, but done perfectly.  We then tried the chicken breast wrapped in chicken skin and the pork cheeks - both wonderfully simple skewers that manage to pack a ton of flavor in a bite.  The duck skewer with balsamic glaze was perfectly crispy and wonderfully flavorful.  Our last dish, a chicken and rice dish with seaweed was packed with flavor in every bite.

I've used a lot of the same adjectives to try to describe the dishes but I'm not sure how to continually describe each dish as wonderful and flavorful and damn near perfect without sounding like I'm repeating myself.

We got seated by the door, which I'm not a fan of, and the hostess didn't want us to transfer. Oh well... But 5 stars because the food is great, and our server is nice. Bill for 2 on Valentine's Day came up to $265 including tip. Be prepared because everything is tapas style (aka small portions) so I recommend getting the CRAB HOT POT to get full, but that's $49 for you. 

We liked the KOBE BEEF FILLET WITH WASABI. For the first time, I liked wasabi; I'm not a fan of anything spicy usually. We like HOU HOU SPARKLING SAKE; one of the best sake I've had so far. Warning: that's $33 for a small bottle. The POACHED EGG WITH SEA URCHIN is very interesting. The texture and the combination of ingredients is different than anything I've tried before, but it works! The FOIS GRAS WITH GLAZED SOY SAUCE ($17) is really worth trying despite the price. It's just one stick so my boyfriend and I split it. It was awesome! Make 2 bites of it and let it linger in your mouth because I regret just taking one bite of it. The AGADESHI TOFU ($11 for whole portion) is the best tasting tofu I've ever had; it has sauce and caviar in it. The BLUE FIN SASHIMI is pretty good. I suggest dipping your sashimi in soy sauce, and put the other ingredients together. Last but not the least, the GREEN TEA CREME BRÛLÉE is a must! It's the perfect way to end your meal. The softness of the green tea combined with the crunchiness of the glaze from the creme brûlée is dynamite!

1982118,2011-06-15,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I read a lot of reviews and knew this was a place to visit.  We first tried to visit it last Saturday right when they opened at 6pm.  ""No reservation??  Sorry -- no openings until after midnight!""  Wow.  I guess that makes sense since there are only about 10 tables in the entire joint.  I felt like a rejected girlfriend.  I needed to get in now.  But with two kids -- what are the chances that my babysitter and an opening at Raku align!??!  Low and behold -- it was tonight.   We made a reservation for 8:30pm after a networking event.  They were booked up but gave us the counter over the phone.  

We arrived 30 minutes early hoping we could work our way in.  They sent us to the ""bar"" first.  The bar is just that -- a walnut, natural wood bar.  But there was no bartender or booze there.  You just wait until it's time while propping your elbow up on the walnut.  Luckily, we didn't wait long (otherwise, the non-bar ""bar"" would have made me mad!).  Plus, we were seated at a REAL table (not the counter).  Usually, I would prefer the counter (a la sushi bar) but this one was just a counter without action to watch.  I think the only main advantage to the counter is to socialize with other diners (which I might add all seem to be really cool, smart people -- a rare find for so many in one location in Vegas!).

We didn't know what to order but took a few recommendations from other YELP reviews.  I can't remember the intricate names of each -- but here's my layman's descriptions of our highlights:

-hot asparagus with crunchy coating (my favorite thing EVER.  Economical and AWESOME).
-Blue Fin sashimi ( a pricey special at $25 - but some of the best sashimi I've ever had)
-Agedashi Tofu (it really is an amazing, almost dessert-like treat in a savory broth)
-Yellowtail skewers.  I usually think it is a shame to cook yellowtail - but I didn't feel that way this time around.
-Butter scallop - it was okay, but not as special as the other items.
-Green tea creme brulee.  THE BOMB.  A great finish to the evening.

I thought all of these reviews were hype - I'm happy to say I was wrong.  Every moment I spent dining at Raku has made me a better person.  I will talk about this experience nonstop to my peers.

The meal started with their agedashi tofu, which was then split into two halves--the original agedashi tofu (hot) and cold tofu traditionally served with their green tea salt, homemade soy sauce, and ginger, as per our waitress' recommendation. I loved the agedashi tofu (the warm, sweet sauce it sits in--yum!) but I thought the cold tofu tasted better and was so much more enjoyable to eat, what with being able to sprinkle green tea sea salt and garnish it with seaweed and stuff. Nonetheless, solid appetizer either way, definitely recommend!

Our list of the other selects: Iberico pork, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon, asparagus wrapped with bacon, kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, duck with balsamic soy sauce, butter sautéed scallop with soy sauce, and tsukune (grilled, ground chicken). Everything tasted delicious, but the ones that stood out were:

-Iberico pork: HOLY COW, you have to ask yourself and really think hard: how can pork belly get any better? Right? Pork belly anything anywhere is delicious... but this one, from Spain, organic pork belly... I don't know man, it's wondrous. Juicy, tender, just the right amount of fat and meat. Careful, though, it's $10 a skewer and we ordered four without knowing!

-Enoki mushroom with bacon: again, another solid dish you can find anywhere, but the bacon has such a smokey flavor that it brings out the best of enoki and makes it better than the ones you've tried anywhere else. A must order.

-Butter sautéed scallop: MY FAVORITE!! Ugh, I die. Sauteed to PERFECTION~ with just enough ""raw-ness"" in the center... doused and double doused, probably, in that insanely mouthwatering-but-not-overwhelming garlic butter sauce. One order (two pieces of scallop) = $7. Pricey, but worth it, I think...

-Duck with balsamic soy sauce: a really good dish, even for non-duck lovers. Tender, juicy, flavorful. Balsamic soy sauce adds a nice dimension to it. Recommended!",m0UOdFnrJvPwLc5ab_ovNQ,7,4,5,Bz924KW1VpxN4M0EHnvC5Q

The reviews were one of the reasons we decided to come to this place, however, its also one of the few times that I have disagreed with the raving reviews of yelp.

We came here about 1 am on a Wednesday morning and even though there were open seats, they still felt that we should wait before being seated. 10 minutes later, we were seated at one of the open seats.

From the onset, the service was a bit slow. Our server asked if we were ready to order right away, but we asked for a minute. It was only after about 15 minutes of waiting we decided to flag our server to order. The food also came slowly but that wasn't really the issue.

So down to the food. We ordered:

1) Aohata Nabe: This was basically a fish stew. This was 40 dollars and my least favorite item that we ordered. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.

2) Tofu Salad: This simple item was probably one of my favorites. It's 7 dollars and pretty flavorful with their green tea salt.

3) Agedashi Tofu: I know that this item is all that yelpers rave about, and it was good, but cooome on... its not that good! 10 dollars. Actually, I thought it was just ""ok.""

4) Asparagus Okaki. This was actually really good. It tasted like Asparagus with Japanese cracker crumbs. 5 dollars.

5) Juicy Fried Chicken: Simple fried chicken served much like a sushi roll. These tasted great. 9 dollars.

6) Tsukune: The ground chicken was my 2nd least favorite. Just very ehh. $3.50.

7) Enoki Mushroom w/ Bacon: This was probably my favorite item of the night, simple yet very tasty. $2.80.

8) Scallop w/ Soy Sauce: The scallop was amazing, especially with the sauce that it comes in. Loved this. 7 dollars.

We tried to order the pork belly but they were out.

All in all, perhaps because of the raving reviews, this place was a slight disappointment. From the slow service to the Aohata Nabe, things were just a bit off with the whole experience. 

The food, in general, is good, but its not that good. This experience reminds the moment when walking out of the movie theaters after watching Hunger Games. OVERRATED. I'm saying this as a person that loves Japanese food (and I'm not talking about California rolls as Japanese food), but real authentic Japanese food.

If you're in the mood for tasty no-frills Chinese/Malaysian food at about 1/6 of the price, go to Big Wong, only a few feet away from Raku.",men42e6XlJo8xSA1p1KMsg,9,0,3,9cFlmiJm4213-y7YDHQt2g

We did the 10 course tasting menu while I added a couple items for myself. Everything was good, but here are the top items of the night. 


House Tofu- Don't even compare this to your grocery-store-bought tofu. It's light and fresh and served with green onions, bonito flakes, and soy sauce. Also, it's a house specialty so I feel like it's a waste to not try it!

Blue Fin Tuna- Okay, I confess. I didn't actually have this. I had everything else on the sashimi platter, but the boys would not shut their mouths about the blue fin tuna for the next few days. So, if it's available, order it. The other fish were very fresh.

Pork Iberico- So juicy and flavorful! If you like fatty pork, definitely order this. We also ordered the pork cheek, but the Iberico was far better.

Kobe Beef Skirt Steak- So yummy... and served with tiny garlic crisps on top. Some of the best skirt steak of my life. It was very tender and had a thick sweet sauce. 

Foie Gras- This stuff melts in your mouth. It's so rich I could just feel my arteries tightening. But it was still deliciously worth it. It's a small medallion, but you should probably share this with others, though you won't want to. 


Everyone who served us was kind, knowledgeable, and very patient while we debated heatedly over what to order to get the most out of our experience. Expect to spend more than $50 per person to be satisfied as most dishes are small. I highly recommend one of the tasting menus for a first-timer.

The decor is nice, but, just in case you were wondering, their restroom has one of those high-tech Japanese multi-function toilets.

First off, it's small plates style eating. Everything is a la carte, and comes out at different times. We chose to order some tofu, fried asparagus, salmon, two different orders of kobe beef, and others. 

The tofu was very hyped up by other reviewers, and I can say it's unlike any other tofu I've had. It's served cold, but it's incredibly fluffy and has a good flavor on it's own, although I would recommend it with the green tea salt and soy sauce. The fried asparagus was also great and comes recommended.

My absolute favorite were the two Kobe beef dishes we ordered. Amazing! This was my first time ordering Kobe beef, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it was DELICIOUS! So tender, so tasty, no big chunks of fat, and covered with just the right toppings in just the right amount. It's worth the $12 for a few cubes of beef!

The letdowns were the rice balls and the fried chicken. I wasn't a fan of either and wouldn't choose those again, despite other reviewers liking them.

--Started off with the Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe.  Personally, I am a big fan of Uni so I had to get this dish.  I thought it was great but the sliminess especially when mixed altogether with nameko mushrooms and okras definitely took a little getting used to.  Only if there were more texture to counter the offputting consistency, this dish would have been excellent.

--Next was Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard.  This dish was really interesting since I have never had foie gras integrated with egg custard before.  The taste is on point with that creamy foie gras texture one would look for.  I decided to give the duck topping to my girl since I annihilated the robata grilled duck.  She said I missed out and should order another so that I could give it a try.

--Their Agedashi Tofu received rave reviews so we decided to give it a try.  The dish itself has great flavors and the fact that it is homemade makes it that much better!

--Also ordered a couple items from their robata grill menu:  
Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi [alright]
Kobe Beef Liver [good]
Kurobuta Pork Cheek [really good]
Pork Ear [good]
Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce [life changing]

--Ended the meal with Green Tea Crème Brulée and hot tea.


Overall experience?  Raku is definitely one of the top contenders for Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas.  I enjoyed how great the service was especially since their employees were friendly and helpful--explained everything regarding the restaurant's menu and other daily specials.  As far as the ambiance goes, dining at this place made me feel as if I were actually at a restaurant in Japan while eating some really great authentic Japanese cuisine.  The restaurant itself is quite small so make sure you make a reservation.  I would certainly come back to try some of their off-menu dishes and maybe even try their ""omakase"" menu.

2092974,2012-01-19,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku has a tiny secret I'd like to share (so I guess it won't be much of a secret then after all..)

There is a dish, a fish roe on top of salmon filet on a bed of rice.  It is NOT the same one that they have on their menu; it isn't listed because of the time it takes and the type of customer who might order it.  It takes about 45 minutes to make because they cook the rice only when you order it.  By far, it is better than a lot of the dishes I tasted there including the amazing uni udon that Misti hadn't tasted ;) (you should though!).

We ordered several other dishes there, mainly from the blackboard that the server had brought over.  Good blue fin tuna is somewhat hard to find and since it was a special occasion that we had dinner for, we decided to get it (despite it's health concerns with high lead content).  I also had a kobe beef tataki from the blackboard that was the best that I had ever tasted, even though I heard that their kobe grade wasn't the highest, but still good.  

A note for kobe enthusiasts:  This is surprising, being a Japanese-owned restaurant.  Typically, Japanese-owned restaurants from my knowledge and experience have an 8 or above grade for their kobe.  Not Raku.  It's not poor, but not the best.  But they certainly made it taste like the best LOL.

The environment of the restaurant is, as another reviewer had said, has the same air of LA snob.  That's true.  But on the other hand, it has the same place as a quaint, hole-in-the-wall yakiniku in Japan.  The restaurant is the smallest Japanese restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas.

Oh, and make reservations.  On a Monday night, I called at 6pm to make a reservation at 8pm.  They didn't have an opening till around midnight.  WOW.  I think that was just a rare moment though, I'm not sure.

Anyways, I gave Raku 5-stars because amidst the glamor and chef-renowned Japanese restaurants at the strip, the restaurant outshines them all in terms of their culinary fidelity to Japanese traditions and flawless service.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,5,2,5,kwi8eY4_smpjr-dCU0yqPw

We made reservations for 6:30 on a Wednesday for 5 and I'm so thankful we did so.

We ordered so much I must highlight some of the best:

Yellowtail Carpaccio: Phenomenally fresh is not even a great enough way to describe the perfection and grade of the Hamachi. On the night we went, one of the specials was Fatty Tuna or  ""Oh Toro"" After experiencing the Hamachi- I almost couldn't fathom any fish tasting greater but this special; unfortunately we didn't order it as it was a bit on the $$$$ side.

The Raw Liver was chewy and rich and even better with a bit of Green Tea Sea Salt.

The Green Tea Noodle soup is a dish you absolutely cannot skip- This was a favorite among everyone.

They also had a special of small soft shell crabs (Picture included above) ""Sawagani"" which you eat whole- I have had this once before at Rising Sun in village square, but haven't seen it anywhere since- I must say this is something the adventurous will not want to miss.

The Kobe Beef Tendon was beyond rich- we only needed two orders of this, but had gotten three. It was incredibly thick and fatty- So good, but I could only handle one piece maybe even half, and one order comes with 2.

Also don't miss out on the Crispy Asparagus, Beef Intestine, Uni, Ground Chicken Portabella. Kobe Beef fillet with Wasabi

The only thing I didn't like was the pork ear- some at my table did enjoy this dish though.

The Green Tea (sake based) Cocktail, was extremely delicious and recommended for anyone who doesn't like to sip on those amazing Junmai Daiginjos they offer.

I'd recommend making reservations waaaay in advance. 

The majority of us ended up getting the omakase. Just one friend requested a gluten free/sugar free option (keto), which they were willing to accommodate.

- Housemade tofu
- Mixed sashimi platter 
- Enochi mushroom wrapped in bacon
- Grilled tomato skewers
- Tsukune-grilled ground chicken
- A whole fried fish
- Kobe beef skirt with fried garlic slices
- Tea
- Watermelon ice

Each dish was presented beautifully. Everything tasted delicious. Truly Japanese food well served. Towards the end of the menu, I was pretty stuffed.

1) Homemade Tofu- best I ever had. Added a little of their special seasonings and the tofu just melted in my mouth. 

2) Sashimi Sampler platter- Beautiful presentation and nice variety. 

3) Fried Chicken- crispy and full of flavor

4) Bacon wrapped enoki- bite size and on skewers. 

5) Small Barracuda- light, soft and flavorful. The server sliced the fish opened and who would have thought this thin fish would be so meaty. 

6) Kobe Beef skewers with fried garlic- I actually thought these were a little tough but had good flavor. 

7) Pork Cheek- A little too fatty for me but some of the others in my group loved this so they ate my portion.

8) Agedashi Salmon- the dashi had excellent flavor and I wish I had a bowl of hot rice to eat this with. 

9) Tuna Tartar- I actually with this one had come before the salmon so I could have the rice. But the tuna was placed on top of a thin layer of nori and on top of a hot cup of rice. So tasty!

Probably one of the best meals I have ever had, eaten in a small joint in a strip mall a few miles away from the strip.  About a 15 minute cab ride away, this place is absolutely worth every (well-priced) penny you'll spend here.

I was a bit confused before I came, and I would have thought that this would have been addressed by some reviewers beforehand, but I'll give it a go.  The Raku menu is full of single items (i.e., $1.50 for a chicken wing, $9 for a a strip of Kobe steak, etc.)  There are also appetizers that can be ordered that are enough to share with the table.  Or, if you're like me, you'll not want to share at all.

Honestly, and I'm not saying this to be lazy, everything we ate was delicious.  There was fried tofu swimming in broth, chicken wings, fish, rice cakes, kobe beef with wasabi, and probably the best fried shrimp I have ever had.

Please make a reservation because they will not take you without one. Walk-ins are only accepted if a party does not show up and the likelihood of that happening is pretty slim. We tried to walk in on a Tuesday with no luck but luckily got an early Thurs reservation.

I think we ordered about 1/2 the menu. I won't go through all the dishes but each and every single dish was solid. From the grill, I love their pork ears. They are fatty and crispy at the same time. They just melt in your mouth. You can also get half orders of the Raku/Agedashi tofu. The tofu here is absolutely amazing! It's very very smooth. Raku's tofu is served cold with bonito shavings, ginger and scallions. Agedashi tofu is lightly fried and served hot in a soy sauce like sauce. You have to try it both ways to get the full effect. 

Mixed thoughts on the service. It feels like they usually have good service but slipped up tonight. We were seated and forgotten for a good 15 min before someone came to take our drink order and give us a second menu.  Our reservation was for 6pm. At about 5 minutes to 8pm, our last order was served. We then wanted to place our last 1 grill item and dessert order. She said something to the likes of ""Oh but you have this table to 8pm. They didn't tell you?"" Uh...no. She was very nice about letting us stay but it was still an awkward exchange. Another table near us was also politely kicked out. Perhaps this was all because they had a big party that night. What's kind of neat is the waitress always asks if she can take your empty bowl even when it's clearly empty and by the side of the table. So polite!

All in all, Raku is a very well rounded restaurant. I definitely prefer this atmosphere over the foofy casino restaurants. For the same price, you get better quality food too.",BE4fE4R3TaVn8xy4sYYjbg,4,3,4,lXiLUimVKobTQx6Z4WO6jQ

And of course, the main chef is in the Vegas location when we were there!

Reservation is very hard to get and rightly so! Larger parties have to reserve at least a month in advance. They only take reservations via phone between 2pm-2am M-Sat and they don't always pick up the phone. Reservation is highly recommended or get ready for a long wait.

We got the omakase meal and there were two choices: $75 vs $100 both are 9 course meals but $100 Omakase dinner offers more premium ingredients per our server. We opt for the 100 meal.

Getting seated was the only frustration of the night but after we got seated, food and service were awesome! Our tea cup was tiny and we constantly drank but we were never left without tea!

I have the say the progression of the meal was also well executed! 

First course was the Raku tofu. Great appetizer to start off the meal. Tofu was light in flavor but you are directly to add green onion, bonito flakes, green tea salt, house made sauce to the tofu. I love the texture of the tofu which was very similar to a Panna Cotta. 

Next came the sashimi plate. Good but nothing out of the usual good sashimi. 

The fried asparagus with crunchy rice batter was delicious! 

Now came the highlight of my night: the perfect langoustine! Omg it was cook just right with the meat slightly transparent. Flavor was awesome! So ridiculously delicious! 

It was love at first sight for my husband when the wasabi wagyu beef skewer came to our table! And it tasted just like the way it looks - juicy and flavorful! Then the pork belly skewer came and also did not disappoint! 

The fried fish was next but I didn't get what type of fish it was. The fish was sitting on house dashi. I was not in love with the fish but it definitely wasn't bad. I enjoyed the dashi, mushroom and wheat mochi more. 

Last savory course of the night was the foie gras don! I love how he added texture to the dish with just a sprinkle of finely cut lettuce. The foie gras was perfectly seasoned and cooked. 

Dessert was a green tea Creme brûlée with green tea ice cream. Also very delicious!

Why has it taken me THIS STINKING' LONG to visit you Raku?! What a delicious meal it was... My favorites of the evening?
*The house tofu  because it reminded me of a savory panna cotta. 
*The hamachi kama was also so delicious and cooked to perfection IMO. Portion was huge and enough to fed 4 hungry girls ;P
*The garlic kobe beef skewers were not as well done as the wasabi version, so the garlic one (to me) tasted better
*The duck - I'm a duck eater. My husband isn't. This was a rare occasion for me and I savored the moment :D

Our server was on point with the explanations and suggestions, which made the meal smooth. Although the booths were tall, we could hear the conversations of people in the same room as us. Luckily we were at the tail end of our meal. I would come back because I need to try the Iberico Pork!!",ceC9qIoD6MDCmENjN11_mA,3,3,4,C6mfap6YkB8iBwrUuasQHw

I recently visited Japan and this restaurant took me right back and made me feel like I was back there again.   I would give this restaurant experience a 10 out of 5 stars!  Here are my notes:

-Very polite, courteous, and instructive staff
- Small plates, enough to give you a little taste of heaven on each plate
-Make a reservation...don't even think about showing up without a reservation
-Two hour dining limit...otherwise you'd eat and drink all night!
-Separate plates for each ""wet"" dish (wait staff are excellent with giving instructions)
-For two people, order about 10 plates
-Everything was served very hot!
-Check out their beautiful bathroom!
-Great, exquisite presentation 

I ordered:

1. Agedashi and Raku tofu (half and half). Their Agedashi tofu is SO GOOD!!! My husband doesn't like tofu but he loved this one!

2. Kobe beef with garlic...I can eat a whole plate of those

3. Chicken with chicken skin...so delicious!

4. Foie gras egg custard...probably wouldn't order it again since I cared more for the foie gras than the custard. I'll get the foie gras don next time.

5. Lamb chop was excellent

6. Fluffy Cheesecake is just a little firmer than tasting like it was whipped, with a thin chocolate crust at the bottom and rasberries to top. 

7. Green Tea to end the meal.

8. Butter Scallop is what I imagine perfectly cooked scallop would taste like. 

Next time, I will try their other foie gras dishes, other Kobe beef dishes, and their seafood. Call, make a reservation, and go!",ouk36OGbx25nO23b10L5jw,5,4,5,fmHUDPbfJXG9xOvzXOFALw

2204480,2012-01-12,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Yes it's true, the restaurant has an air of la snob. 

Don't even think about walking in without an reservation, it's impossible to get a seat even though a lot of seats may look empty. Apparently, there are ""reservations."" We saw this happen to many people and we also attempted at it once.

We were 10 minutes early for our reservation but since the restaurant hadn't technically ""opened"" yet, we were made to wait outside in the grimy Chinatown sidewalk. Which was fine. Then we saw 4 international guests walk out of the restaurant fully fed and intoxicated. These guys were probably friends with the chef/owner or were especially special guests because the staff were farewelling them and all this fancy stuff. This was fine too. So we were the only 2 waiting outside and finally the restaurant had opened but we weren't sure if we could enter because the door was still closed and the hostess didn't invite us in. So we waited some more and finally we thought screw it let's go inside. We got in and there was no ""thank you for waiting"" courtesy and the chef was standing around in his undershirt. Finally, we got seated and I have to admit I started dinner a little bit aggravated and unsure why I was here. 

The cold service was quickly forgotten as I dove into our first dish (Kanpachi), then our second, then our third, fourth, fifth...twelveth. The food was ridiculously delicious -- Japanese food taken to another level! The service gets better once you are seated and you order food. The waitress describes and food and is polite.

My favorite items:
1. Raku's Tofu - homemade, best tofu I've ever eaten
2. Sashimi Salad - the dressing is superb
3. Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic - obviously this is going to be awesome!
4. Butter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce - I wished I ordered more of this dish. Sharing one was simply not enough for me!
5. Daily Special: Kanpachi - super fresh
6. Daily Special: Blue Crab Miso Soup - you can actually taste both ingredients.

Maybe will order again:
1. Melting chocolate cake - if I have room, I'd order this again
2. Green tea creme brulee - this one was standard, nothing special

Wouldn't order again:
1. Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe - Visually and ideally appealing but the texture creeped me out. I thought I was eating really flavorful phlegm. 
2. Agedashi Tofu - Raku's tofu was better because the simple ingredients enhanced the tofu. The Agedashi was a bit overpowered by sauce. 
3. Oyako Don Chicken and Egg - I don't think it's a dish you should order at a restaurant like this
4. Oyster Isobeyaki - The way it was grilled made the oyster way too chewy for my taste. And, I didn't like the crispy seaweed accompanying it. 

Also, if you have time check out my photos of all the things we ate!",ZlgmfdzsNpa8zD6NmSrcVA,4,0,5,eh5TfKMBHt3yKXAjNUcOeg
2205770,2011-03-05,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku is what I would call Las Vegas' most avant garde Japanese izakaya in the city. The food at the restaurant is about as authentic and minimal as any restaurant on the Japanese islands themselves. The chef of the restaurant is well renowned for making his own tofu and soy sauce and the dedication to his craft shows in every dish that is served in Raku. 

The ambiance of the place is cozy while maintaining an air of exclusiveness that most patrons seem to relish in. Although it's no longer the prized hidden jewel of the city, most people that give Raku frequent patronage still regard the small restaurant as a secret treasure. 

The menu is interesting and filled with unique ingredients that are designed for more sophisticated palates. If fois gras, beef liver, sea urchins, tendons, and pork ears are all new to your culinary vocabulary, Raku might not be the place for you.

The ""Agedashi Tofu"" is the must have item on the menu. Traditionally, agedashi tofu is a type of battered tofu that is fried until the outside is golden brown and then served with tentsuyu broth, grated daikon (type of Asian radish), and bonito flakes. The Raku specialty way of making agedashi tofu is unrivaled with any other restaurant in the city that offers the same selection.

The poached egg with uni (sea urchin) and ikura (salmon caviar), is another absolute favorite. The silky and rich smoothness of the uni paired with the buttery thickness of the bursting egg yolk goes perfectly with the salty pop given off by the ikura. 

Raku offers a decent selection of Japanese sake for you to sample. A lot of women tend to love the sparkling sakes that they offer here. As a note of advice to all sake drinkers, do not order hot sake or ask them to heat a bottle of cold sake. The Japanese heat lower grade sake to mask its flaws. Anytime one heats alcohol, it renders the characteristics of the alcohol obsolete and thus any sake served hot is because it is ultimately a low quality sake that isn't worth drinking cold.",lcbJ_02EYZ0g1Mu6HNPzsQ,5,3,4,eXXGTREY_GY3DQiGerzk0Q

The food was interesting and unusual to my palate and there were some significant stand outs. As everyone says you should try the tofu the taste is still bland but the texture is amazing and the chef includes little bit of heat and mushrooms and chives to complement the tofu and it all works. The super juicy Fried chicken is awesome and it's a huge portion for one person. We had a slight problem with the serving staff which are mostly female. When we said thanks they never said you're welcome when I went to go to the restroom they blocked my path and made no effort to move. I got over it and we moved along I would never go back to this place because of the service.

We went here to celebrate the bf's birthday; I made reservations about a month in advance (via phone only). Reservations is recommended as the place is small/intimate, and I believe max seating would be for a party of 5-6. 

I LOVE their house-made salt, chili, and sauces. They were ALL delicious! And even though its not needed on any of their dishes, it subtly elevates each bite. The description on the tray is also a very nice touch.

Service is wonderful. I don't think you can go wrong with any dish you order - lamb chop, kobe beef, anything with foie gras, crispy asparagus, etc... YUM!

p.s. They were out of the sea urchin and poached egg dish when we were there, the only disappointment of the evening. Just gives me even more of a reason to go back :)

I dragged my husband here for an 11pm seating - the only reservation I could snag at the last minute. When we arrived, I was very surprised to see that the restaurant was fairly quiet- the sushi bar was completely empty and two tables were also open in the main room.

We chose the $75 tasting menu and got off to a fantastic start with the excellent tofu and then the sashimi- both were the best we've ever had. I also liked the attention to detail of our server, who explained how to eat each dish in detail.

From there, the experience dipped, and we were served some very average dishes - a deep fried mackerel filled with bones and guts was definitely a lowlight; two dishes later we're were served mackerel again in a broth with mushrooms (I'm not into receiving the same type of fish twice, especially if it's mackerel), then our final dish was tuna tartare served on rice- the problem here is that we'd had the same tartare preparation but with a whitefish as part of the sashimi course - this is just laziness!! 

All in all, it is not worth the trip out here for the food. It was also impossible to find transport home! After dinner, we waited 40 mins for a taxi that never showed.

2227489,2011-11-06,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku, quite simply, is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the world.  

Featuring a diverse menu of grilled, stewed, and cooked Japanese items, Raku features equally diverse price points for dining as well.  Order exclusively off the robata grill and stewed menu and you can easily eat for under $20/person.   Feel more adventurous and trusting of the chef at $45/person and you'll leave feeling full and satisfied while trying more exotic fare.  Or finally opt for a formal kaiseki menu (3 day advance order) and you'll have a divine Japanese food experience that will challenge any set menu you've probably ever had.  

No matter what price point you select, Raku's constant will be exceptionally prepared food.   People have called even the priciest meals here true bargains and it makes everything else simply a steal. 

The drink selection that pairs well with the food is equally diverse and just as price friendly.  Bottles of quality sake, Japanese beer, and cocktails range from amazingly under $10 to well north of $150.  Anyone can truly eat here and  if I lived closer I'd be having regular weekday meals, special celebratory meals, as well as any weekly meal I could sneak in. 

Some standouts from our most recent meal:

Foie Gras egg custard with smoked duck and black truffle - representing the clear high end, this dish utilizes almost every high priced ingredient in a chef's repertoire.  The flavor was divine as the Foie Gras custard was cooked perfectly and presented in a gorgeous empty egg shell.  The black truffle was a decadent, but much appreciated, addition. 

Kobe beef seared over hot rock with garlic - perfectly presented on a bed of hot rocks, the Kobe beef is seared to perfection.  The thinly sliced garlic adds the minimal flavoring needed. 

Daikon and beef tendon oden - the other end of the price spectrum and the most affordable items on the menu at $1.50 and $2 respectively.   Ultimate comfort food...perfectly sliced and tender beef tendon and stewed daikon radish served in a perfect broth complimented by a small wallop of Japanese mustard.  

Fresh oyster served with minced okra, seasoned scallions and uni - again the presentation was perfect as the oyster was shelled and delicately sliced before being placed back in the shell.  The fresh uni and seasoned scallions perfectly counteracted the brininess of the oyster. 

Overall, my meal at Raku was one I had looked forward to all year and it did not disappoint.   While we indulged for a special occasion, we still found amazing bargains in the oden stew and the extensive sake selection.  

Raku is truly a special restaurant and their dedication to top quality food is evident the moment you sit down and notice that every condiment (ie: salt, pepper, chili oil, soy sauce) is house made.   It only gets better from there. 

For those who love comparisons, I can attest for me that my meals here have been better than some of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the past, including, but not limited to: Gochi (Cupertino), Sumika (Los Altos), Nobu (HK), Momofuku (NYC), Morimoto (CA) and many more.  Yes, many of those places are great but I love Raku even more. I still can't believe it's in Vegas!

Never, ever get the omakase here. This is one of the places where you are far better NOT trusting the chef. For a $100 omakase we got:

1) oyster and caviar: not terrible, not great
2) assorted sashimi: pretty okay
3) grilled cherry tomatoes with truffle oil: a 5 year old could have made this. Lemonade is harder.
4) garlic butter scallop: overcooked.
5) chicken skewer: dry. Honda-ya grade.
6) mini-shabu: like shitty boiling point
7) tuna don: nearly made me gag. Tasted like floor of a third world fish market in the summer. Waitress insisted it was cut tonight. Yeah that doesn't mean the fish isn't a week old. She just ducked her head and walked away. Wow. 
8) green tea crime brûlée: at this point, I honestly didn't give a fuck.

For parties of 6 or more, there was a mandatory 20% gratuity. In the real world, this is ridiculous. 

I have no idea who is writing these 5 star reviews of this place. It boggles my mind. It isn't even a matter of being overpriced, this is just a bad restaurant. They knew were we're having a terrible experience and did nothing to address it. Maybe it's because this is vegas and there's always a new sucker born every minute so they have no incentive to have any customer service.

It was our first time there so, although it isn't on the menu, we opted for omakase. So for a flat price we let the chef decide what he wanted to serve us.

We received about 10 dishes each one quite tasty. A few of the dishes featured tofu, so the tastes are subtle. The food at Raku isn't packed with punch-you-in-the-face flavor. They are just perfectly prepared and arranged beautifully for a very fine dining experience.

It's a small space in an otherwise unassuming shopping center with several other restaurants, including a korean BBQ and Monta noodle house. Walking in, it's a relaxing space with lots of warm colored, glossy wood tables and intimate lighting. The decor is much nicer than you would anticipate from the surrounding neighborhood. They've recently received a bit of media praise and when we went there was only bar seating available despite it being after 1 AM. Our party of 2 had no problem with that and were seated by a cute waitress. It being the night before Halloween, they were all in costume! Fun! Plus, everyone was speaking REAL Japanese back and forth, from the waitress to the kitchen staff, not just pretending. 

We were told we only had a half hour or so to order, so we gave the menu a run down and got to it. We started with a 10 oz bottle of cold sake. Our waitress suggested that we try Junmai Ginjo 'Dewazakura Oka', a cherryblossom scented sake with a clean, smooth floral flavor and slight hints of fruit. I also ordered a green tea, which was forgotten, but I'll forgive them since it was packed and she may have thought I just changed my mind when we got the sake. Our bottle was $18 and was enough for the two of us to share over our meal without becoming perilously incapacitated. Because sake is a sobriety ninja like that, it'll slap you silly when you don't expect it to if you're not careful!

The FOOD:
- Uni in seaweed soup: The uni was sublimely sweet and creamy with a warm exterior from the rich dashi-type broth. It was presented in an adorable wooden bowl with the uni nestled among the seaweed like eggs in a nest. The seaweed was well prepared, with a firm texture and bite. I hate slimy seaweed and this was definitely well prepared quality wakame.  - $4
- Sashimi Salad: 3 types of sashimi on tender baby spinach leaves with a savory/sweet dressing, crisped shallots or bonito & a smear of a spicy paste on the side that could be mixed into the salad. It was light and refreshing, with sweet pieces of fish. When served, the waitress told us which pieces were what, a nice attention to detail that I appreciate. High spinach to fish ratio, but it's $9 and it was the largest dish we were served.
- Kobe Beef Filet with wasabi: J's favorite, for sure. I really enjoyed this! The piece was roughly 4"" long and 1/2""x1"" on a skewer with a thin line of wasabi along top. The meat was perfectly cooked and melted as I bit into it. I would go back for this item alone. At $9.50 for a relatively small portion of meat, it's not exactly budget dining, but it's a lovely option to have and still much more affordable than any of the premier steak houses.
- Kobe Beef Skirt with garlic: Also fabulous, though it's hard to say if I liked this or the wasabi one better. This had a different grain and so a different overall mouth feel, but still melted apart as I bit into it. The flavor was great, clean, quality beef with crispy pieces of garlic in a row along the top. At $6 it's a little more affordable than the filet, and I can see ordering many rounds of this item with some friends.
- Asparagus with bacon: 3 asparagus tips wrapped in small pieces of bacon and grilled. It's a simple idea and presented in a small portion. The asparagus still had a crisp bite and the bacon added a nice smoky flavor, but I don't know if I'd want to order this again. $2.50 for 3 bite size pieces of asparagus is a bit much for me. 
- House Tofu, 1/2 hot & 1/2 cold: the cold tofu came out first. It had a consistency like mascarpone or creamy cheese, with a very cooling sensation in the body. It was served with lots of thin, flaky bonito, green onions and grated ginger as well as a small offering of sauces/salt that wait on the table. I enjoyed this dish a lot but the boy didn't. Definitely a different beast than the cubes of tofu you can buy in most grocery stores. I topped it with all the plated options and a drizzle of the umeboshi spiked soy sauce. Yuuuuum!
The hot tofu was fried, giving it an interesting textured skin and a creamy interior. The broth it came in was dark, with a rich mix of flavors. Orbs of ikura floating on top with a few baby mushrooms in the broth provided great textural interest, especially the briny bursts of flavor the ikura provided in contrast with the creamy tofu interior. I like it better than many of the agedashi tofus I've had elsewhere and it stands unique from it's peers. $10 for the two tofu dishes, but it was a lot of tofu! This was easily the second largest order we recieved.
- Kurobuta pork cheek: Skewered bits of crispy fatty meat. It has a different texture than some would probably like- with a texture that's an cross between gizzard [crunchy yet chewy, gristly, fatty] and bacon. It didn't taste greasy or heavy, and was recommended by our waitress. I liked it but it won't be the first thing I have to order upon returning. $2.50",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,4,3,5,2fOSLVB7yWmpGl1euZSX0A

2289836,2011-04-26,6,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Time for an update!  Since my last review I've been to the sake tasting and had the Kaiseki menu. 

First, the sake tasting.  This happened back in February.  $45 for AYCE Raku food PLUS all the sake and Sapporo you can drink!  All the tables are reorganized for a cocktail-type service.  The food is freshly cooked and is served at the bar buffet style in the front of the restaurant.  Small servings of tofu, various skewers of meat from the Robata grill, asparagus wrapped in bacon, all the good stuff.  The staff just keeps cooking and bringing food out.  It was from 10pm to 2am, which is not the best time for me, but it was worth it!  Not too crowded.  We made a reservation but they accepted walk-ins too.  People come and go as they please so that helps.  The sake servers are really knowledgeable.  I learned a lot.  I really, really hope they do this again but I have not seen another announcement for this since the last one in February.  Such a good deal and so much fun, too!

Second, I had the 15-course Kaiseki menu earlier this month.  This is not for the faint of heart or those who are in a hurry.  It's $150 per person and they need at least 3 days notice.  You need to make a reservation and they take your credit card number because they actually start preparing your meal 3 days in advance!  The website says it takes about 3 hours to complete.  Ours took around 3.5 hours.  It was an awesome experience!  The menu changes each time but here are some of the highlights: homemade tofu served with roe, sashimi, foie gras custard, a sampling of their appetizers including deep fried chicken and crispy asparagus, steak and garlic cooked on a really hot stone, and fluffy cheesecake.  I've downloaded pics if you are interested.  Definitely come hungry.  I didn't eat all day.  There is also a $100 10-course menu.

Didn't realize there was a specials menu until we saw a server carry the black board over to a different guest sitting at the bar.  Someone sat next to us and we kindly asked if they didn't mind scooting down one, as someone else would be joining us.  The server came over upset and rude telling us that we can't do that, even though he was willing to move. She told us that the host needs to know.  When we tried to ask the host he was too busy to care and said he would come back. Within less than 5 min our friend arrived so we stood at the bar waiting. The host did not offer a seat until our friend already walked out the door because of the poor service. The seat he offered was opposite of the guest who was sitting alone. They would really seat us apart from eachother?!  Really was a downer on our evening. And tonight was the one night in 2 years that my friend and I had together. Really stuck up here.  A shame the food was decent. Sashimi salad was good if you are looking for something raw. Yellowtail was good quality fish, but I've had it better prepared elsewhere. The item that stands out the best are Wagyu skewers tender, flavorful, and the fat of it just melts. We ordered all the desserts. The cheesecake was worth getting, light with a chocolate crust. The chef tried to make up for the service. He was much kinder and served us water when the waitress wouldn't come by.  For the price, and experience there was nothing on the menu worth coming back for.  Had it not been for how we were treated there would have been other items I would like to come back and  try. I appreciate great food and don't mind spending to have a good time. To spend that kind of money where they are not kind or accommodating isn't worth it.

2331826,2011-12-03,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Kaiseki with sake pairing is the way to go!

I have been hearing about the Kaiseki menu and I finally had a chance to experience it.  Kaiseki is an artistic and gracious Japanese seasonal course cuisine.  Raku offers 2 Kaiseki options: 10 courses or 15 courses.  I ordered the 15 course Kaiseki with sake pairing.  All the dishes were beautifully and artistically presented.  They were uniquely flavored yet all blends together like a harmony.  I don't know the name of each dish but I am going to try to describe some my personal highlights in the order of the course (good thing I took pictures to help me remember):

Highlight 1: I believe it was course 2 - a platter of 9 different bite size items (1. salmon on egg york, one of my favorites, it just smelts in your mouth; 2. flash fried asparagus, one of the all time favorites at Raku; 3. Duck skewer which is tender and perfectly seasons)

Highlight 2: Course 3 - the dish came in a white ceramic box with a floral design on the lid.  It was perfected wrapped and presented. When it was served, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open my present.  Inside the box, it was a piece of super fresh and delicious tofu.  The tofu was paired/garnished with Ikura (Salmon Roe) and fresh green tea powder.  I was never a fan of Ikura but the Ikura here was super fresh. The cold and silky tofu was enhance by the Ikura, which was like a burst of fresh and cold liquid with a faint hint of the sea and it was mixed with the slightly sweet yet dry green tea powder... I don't know how to better describe it except to tell you it was heavenly...

Highlight 3: Dobin Mushi (tea pot soup) - The soup is literally cooked in a tea pot filled with a piece of chicken, a piece of fish, mushroom, and 2 ginko beans.  This is a very traditional Japanese soup. This dish is seasonal because of the special type of mushroom (i don't remember what it is called).  I enjoyed the soup, although I thought a small piece of lime would enhance the flavor further (plus thats the way I've always had it in Asia).

Highlight 4: flute & blue fin tuna - It was sooo cute that I cried a little... for the fact that it was so heavenly and for the fact that my children will probably not have a chance to experience this deliciousness 

Highlight 5: glazed chicken thigh.  I don't remember what the chicken thigh was glazed with, but it tasted like it was brined and then boiled.  The chicken was sliced into thin slices and garnished with two roman tomatoes.  It is the most perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender chicken I've ever had!  The chicken was serviced with a reduction sauce.. it was so good that my friends licked their plates!!!

Highlight 6: foie gras custard - OMG if there's food in heaven... this would be it!  the dish was served in a whole egg shell with the top sliced off leaving a little opening big enough for you to dig your little spoon into it to spoon out a mouthful of yumminess.  There is a small piece of foie gras on top of the custard... I wish there were more...  :-9

Highlight 7: Uni Shooter (THIS IS MY FAVORITE!!!  YOU MUST HAVE THIS WHEN YOU VISIT RAKU).  The dish is served in a martini glass and it was soo FANTASTICALLY DELICIOUS!  There were small pieces of different things... (I know i'm not describing it well) but all the textures and flavor.. it was seriously A PARTY IN MY MOUTH!!!

Highlight 8: Kobe beef covered with garlice slices on a hot stone flambed with XO.  The meat was tender and sweet.  I was afraid that the meat was going to be tough being on the hot stone and having it flambed in front of me, but to my surprise, it was perfectly cooked.  The XO and the garlic nicely seasoned and caramelized the beef when flambed while the hot stone brown the meat on the other side.  TO DIE FOR!

There were a few dishes that I was not overly impressed about (scoring 7.5 out of 10 versus 10 out of 10), but over all, the entire meal was great.

We had a different sake for every 3 dishes.  We started with a sparkling sake, it was almost like a sweet sparking wine. It was very yummy... I like my sake dry, so I would have loved it at the end of the Saiseki.

The service was great.  We had our own private room and it really enhanced the ambiance.  The service was great.  The server describes each dish carefully.  He provided information on the food, how it was cooked, where certain items were from, which made the dish unique, as well as how to eat them (for example of the tofu dish in Highlight 2 to take each bite of the tofu by dipping it in the green tea powder along with a Ikura to create the optimal experience).

Our reservation was at 8:00pm and we did not finish dinner until 3 and half hours later at 11:30. It was a great experience and I would highly recommended for special occasions since I got a little sticker shocked when I got the bill for $350 for just my share =D",j1MNVNQfyupd9MuKXLsM7w,1,0,5,2uQq7s8v_eUjmnTaSeJnww
2334609,2012-07-09,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"There are two ways to enjoy Raku (Las Vegas), Izakaya-style or Omakase-style (I believe they call it Kaiseki).  Both are excellent.  But the latter is truly 5 stars.  

Several months ago, we were unable to score reservations for the main dining room (our usual Vegas hang-out spot), and our small group was told that we could get a table in the ""omakase"" section, where we would have to order one of the Kaiseki (full-course consisting of various raw and cooked seasonal items) courses.  

Now, just for the record, I rarely order a ""Kaiseki"" or ""Omakase"" course at a typical Aburiya (aka ""Izakaya""), but having done my homework on the chef/owner (Chef Endo, whose background is in traditional Kaiseki (in Tokyo), who then moved to global fame as executive chef of Megu NY), I was more than willing to give it a try.  And I've been hooked ever since.

One of the most memorable Kaiseki dishes we had here was the whole  Nodoguro white fish, a seasonal winter fish.  Apparently only two of these whole fish made its way to Las Vegas that winter day, via direct flight from Tokyo, and we got one of them.  One of the most fun ways of enjoying an excellent fish is to see how different it tastes under different preparation.  Chef Endo understands this completely, and we were served different parts of the same fish as three different courses.  First, the Sashimi.  Second, steamed with ginger and seasoned with a light Dashi-based sauce.  Third, grilled with pinches of sea salt.  An ultra-fresh fish is a must for Sashimi, but when you have that sashimi-grade fish expertly steamed or grilled, it's absolute heaven.  The heat breaks down the amino acids of the fish, significantly boosting the Umami factor.  I would argue that the most delicious way to enjoy fresh fish is lightly cooked, and not raw.  

Honestly, the skewers that they threw into the Kaiseki course were meh, but the home-made Tofu, the fish dishes, and the soups were absolutely amazing.  Can't wait for my next trip to Vegas and Raku!  I gotta make sure to book at least a week in advance!",OkWWTX6M5nMo9p6Qtz6Meg,2,2,5,V6YMbkBCoM6wVEl22RM9YA

And because we did, we ended up with probably the best seats in the house: a private booth near the back, complete with a buzzer for our server. I have to admit, it was pretty neat!

Anyway, we got some specials - blue fin sashimi and baigai, along with about 5 other courses. Kobe beef fillet with wasabi, tsukune grilled ground chicken, chicken breast wrapped in chicken skin, raku's tofu, and their melting chocolate cake.

I loved that the servers let us know different ways to enhance the food, and (considering I am dating a chef) was able to answer every question thrown at them. The sashimi was superb - very young, and I have to say, putting the soysauce nori on top with wasabi was a kicker! The baigai threw me off a bit; it was our first time eating snail, and it was delicious. Kobe beef, always a great pick, and both chickens were just yummy - the aroma and taste took me straight back home. The tofu was probably my favorite! Perfect consistency, heavenly with the soysauce. The melting chocolate cake was also nummy - however, I wish the green tea ice cream was a little more, well, green tea-ish. 

Needless to say, I was stuffed. Very stuffed and happy. If you want to be, too, go to Raku!!",kzcV915OiYfusuKaS84hig,0,0,5,r1f0pw9A48ufzdToeVlsuw

Grateful for an awesome company, we were greeted with friendship and hospitality, thanks to Satay's own Saturday nights Patio Sessions resident DJ Nathan Sense Uhlir, who splurged us with a pitcher of Sapporo beer and a side of laughs throughout dinner.

It has been a while since my last visit to Raku and I was pleased that Raku expanded their restaurant with a new room. The table that we sat in was really cool. It had an open rectangular shape in the middle of our booth/table that had a mini traditional/organic barbecue pit.

Mr. Uhlir ordered most of the items on the special black board menu and everything was fantastic! I only wish that I had written down the names, but since I didn't my list of items in US version as follows:

Homemade cold and hot tofu.
Raw cold meat with amazing edible accessories on top & a drop of sauce
Special Toro Dish (seared fatty tuna)
Special grilled Salmon collar bone

from the Robatta Grill:
Enoki Mushroom wrapped with Bacon
Green Hot Chili Pepper 
Kurobuta Pork Cheek

And last but not least: Soba buckwheat noodle salad with amazing secret dressing! Each time we order this salad, we drink the excess dressing like soup!

All were delicious. The yellowtail glazed with soy sauce was amazing. However my favorite was the agedashi tofu. The tofu is homemade and one of the best I've had. The tofu is fried and placed in a light broth that was so good I wanted to drink it straight from the bowl! Other delicious items were the chazuke, the foie gras chawanmushi udon, and the Yuzu sake.

Having read the extremely positive reviews by fellow Yelp-ers, we cabbed over to Raku on a Monday for the 1st dinner of our recent Vegas trip. We figured that the restaurant should be able to accommodate us given that our small party and it's a Monday night; but we were wrong. Raku is a restaurant popular amongst locals and you'd be wise to make a reservation in advance. The hostess initially told us that all the tables were booked and turned us away; we told her that we are quick eaters. ;) In the end, the manager gave us a table that is booked for a time slot 2 hours later. It's great to see that they respect and honor reservations.

Over the 1.5 hours we were at Raku, we enjoyed every bit of it. I love that we could order individual servings of oden and yakitori skewer sticks at reasonable prices, much like how food is ordered at oden bar, yakitori bars in Japan. Home-made sauces (e.g. their own soy sauce) are available at the table. Our waitress gave excellent recommendations.  The whole experience is well-paced and not rushed. 

Dishes we loved -
* Home-made tofu: When our waitress asked whether we'd like the home-made tofu served regularly or fried. My husband and I blurted out different answers at the same time (!). The restaurant was nice to accommodate serving the tofu two ways so that we were able to experience both..and they both turned out to be delicious!  The Raku tofu (non-fried version) sported natural flavors of the tofu, while the fried version tasted a little like agedashi tofu and came in a yummy broth.
* Sashimi: Who would think that at an inland city offered such fresh raw fish?  We ordered the shiro ebi (white shrimp) sashimi and hirame sashimi. Both were super sweet from their freshness and we got quite a bit of hirame from one order!
* Grill/yakitori skewers: You pretty much can't go wrong with any of their grill skewers. I especially liked the Kurobuta pork cheek, foie gras, enoki wrapped in bacon skewers.
* Green tea crème brulée: Remember to save room for dessert!  The green tea crème brulée was divine!

We can't wait till we return to Raku again.  Chef Endo, please consider opening a place in the San Francisco bay area!",65uXk38DABB4uofHRP7VyQ,1,0,5,Q6CNUZ6egsYT_DDQA5cyUA

I have been wanting to try Raku ever since I heard about it. The first couple times we tried to go, we called that day and they were booked until way past my bedtime. So we decided to plan ahead and made reservations a couple of weeks in advance. I wanted to make sure and try the best items so when we made our reservations, I requested the $75 omakase dinner. 

For our first course we had the sashimi salad. This was one of my favorites of the night. It came with 2 dressings, one spicy and one sweet. The fish was high quality. The crisp onions on top provided a nice flavor and textural contrast. It was a lovely way to start our meal.

Next we were served Raku's tofu. They make their own tofu and it comes with bonito, green onion, and ginger. The waitress suggested using the green tea salt and soy sauce to season it as well. The soy sauce is homemade and has a slightly sweet flavor. The tofu had a creamy, smooth texture. I never imagined imagined eating plain tofu and liking it, but I did.

For our third course we had Agedashi tofu which was deep fried tofu in a miso broth topped with salmon roe. It was exceptional. This was another of my favorites of the night. I don't know how they make tofu so delicious!

Next up was grilled tomatoes. They had a nice charcoal grill flavor.

Course 5 was juicy deep fried chicken. It was served on a bed of spinach and had awesome crispy skin with sesame. It was indeed juicy and very tasty.

We then had asparagus with bacon. It consisted of 3 small spears of asparagus wrapped in bacon. The bacon had a nice smoky grilled flavor.

Our seventh course was butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. The scallop was nicely cooked and the sweet soy sauce complemented the dish nicely. This was in my wife's top three dishes.

Our next dish was yellowtail with glazed soy-based sauce. It was served with minced radish. The radish made the dish go from good to great. It was a perfect pairing.

Next up was chicken wrapped with skin. It was salty and was a great contrast to the previous slightly sweet courses. The skin was sinfully good.

We then were served Kurobuta pork cheek. It was chewy and reminded me of steak fat. That might not sound appetizing, but it was really good.

For our 11th course we had Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic. My wife loved how the garlic chips complemented by the beef. I liked it too, but by this time I was getting full.

Next was another of my favorites, steamed foie gras egg custard. The custard was beautifully cooked. It was served in a delicious broth. Though I was getting full by now, I couldn't stop eating it.

After that we were served Tsukune grilled ground chicken. It looked like a chicken sausage. I was stuffed so I only ate a bite and took the rest home.

We then were given grilled rice balls. One was flavored with soy sauce and the other with miso. I only had a bite and packed the rest.

Lastly, we were given two desserts. First up was green tea creme brûlée. The green tea ice cream was subtly flavored and just slightly sweet. It was a nice balance to creme brûlée.

Our other dessert was cheesecake. It had raspberries hidden inside. I love raspberries, and when I ate the raspberry sitting on top of the cheesecake I exclaimed, ""That's a nice raspberry!""  The cheesecake was fluffy and airy. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce and green tea salt.

Playing in the background was Japanese elevator music, including a rendition of Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" which was pretty neat.

The bathroom has artificial grass on the floor, a fake tree growing up the wall, foliage on the ceiling, birds playing in the background, and flower petals on the floor. A must see!

The meal was definitely delicious, but I think we should have gone with a $50 omakase meal as there were about five too many courses. I well definitely go back! Can't wait to try my favorites again and sample some new dishes!",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,15,13,5,BuhNEH-hQViEY_aWvXmMHg

Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!
As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. 
That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. 
Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.

Now onto the food shall we?

I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...

Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! 

Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!

Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more 

Butter sautéed scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!

Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.

Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! 

Other notable dishes included:
Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2
Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2
Foie gras egg custard 10
Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2
Iberico Pork 10 x2
Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)

All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!

My boyfriend and I have been trying to get reservations here for months since we moved to Henderson in October and they are always booked and closed on Sundays.  We finally scored a reservation this Tuesday at 6pm opening time. I was actually nervous that it wouldn't live up to the hype I had created in my own mind, but we both agreed that it was absolutely worth the wait!!
Parking is scarce, so we ended up with street parking about a block around the corner.  As soon as we walked into the cozy spot, we were greeted with a welcome cheer from the staff. We really enjoyed the welcome and eventually began chiming in when other guests entered or left through the front door. So fun!
Our server was fantastic. We are very sorry that we didn't get his name but he was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about everything from the menu to explaining the condiments on the table and uses for them. 
On to the food.. let me start by saying this is a small plate style menu and we had a feast! We started with one of the specials, grilled king crab legs and they were to die for!  No drawn butter side per the usual crab order, these legs were perfectly char grilled and so full of flavor we didn't even miss it. This was followed by yellowtail carpaccio and pig ears. The carpaccio was beautiful and fresh, so bright and appealing that the table next to us decided to order one. This was the first time we ever tried pig ears and I honestly wished I had a bag of them to take home for later. Delicious!
Our second round consisted of wagu filet with wasabi, and skirt with garlic shavings, Kurobuta pork cheek and ribs. There is something about the flavor of the char from that robata grill that brings out the flavor of everything it touches!  I was so fascinated at the unique flavors, I left dying for a charcoal grill!

2446845,2010-07-01,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I'm a little surprised at all the stellar reviews here. I do notice most of the people reviewing are not Japanese so maybe a Robata grill is a new experience for many. At the end of the day Raku is a good Robata grill, nothing too special. I think the Anthony Bourdain Japan episodes must have brainwashed people.

The food is highly overpriced and served with a simple straightforward presentation. We ordered a couple fish specials, a bit of foie gras over rice, omusubi in broth and green tea soba which came to about $100. I have to say the grilled unagi and saba were very good but left us unfulfilled. They sold the saba (mackerel) as ""saba from Japan!"" which made us laugh because its a cheap fish no matter where its from. It was simply grilled and served whole with a delicious crusty skin. The portion was enough for maybe a 4yr old so it was a little rough paying $30 for an appetizer sized entree. Unagi was about 8 pieces of eel served sashimi style, grilled, glazed etc. slightly better than something you would get at Little Buddah. The green tea soba tasted like...soba. The omusubi in broth took about 30mins to prepare and was very disappointing. Its just a grilled rice ball in broth but the flavor of the broth was a bit repulsive.

All in all it was solid dinner but very overpriced and left us so hungry that we were scared to order more. Its not a matter of being cheap because I dine out in great restaurants often...its more of a ""did I just pay $100 for chicken on a stick?"" I would say if you are a robata newbie come for the experience but leave your appetite at home.",XHyjpxiGpL_0m4snbBfOKQ,3,0,3,rKTsjVOgPoMWMygTB64eOg

2455336,2012-02-28,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"So there we were, our first night in for the weekend in Vegas and starving. We headed to chinatown from the Rio, reluctant as I've always been the typical tourist that is attached to the strip like a naked stripper is on me, but obviously my reluctance was misplaced. After being ripped off by a local cabby, we found ourselves at an asian inspired strip mall. Every store front was either japanese or chinese and in the corner was Raku, our destination for the evening.


The restaurant, with its low ambient lighting and small room was very intimate. The customary japanese greeting was very much appreciated and we were seated at a well sized table right across from the sushi bar. The server came over, took our drinks and in broken english tried to explain the specials. It is a good thing that most were written on a chalk board that she brought to the table, although it didn't help much that all that was written was the english phonetic spellings of the japanese name of the dish.


We settled on order a variety of tapas that were quite delicious and although I don't remember exactly what the japanese names were, you'll easily be able to find them on the menu should you decide to head there and try it yourself. I've decided to only mention a few that really stuck out in my mind that I think is a must have when dining there. I wish that I had more time and a larger stomach to try more choices, but that may have to wait until the next visit.

We had an order of the Agedashi Tofu which was superb. A must try. It was well seasoned and beyond comparison to what I would find back home in Calgary and might I even say, Vancouver. Along side was the hot version of their tofu, also well accept in my mouth and I think a worthwhile try.


The blue fin tuna was exquisite. A rare food item here in Canada, it was a sashimi that could not be refused. Priced at almost around $20 it was an expensive but delicious treat to try this not so common fish. Presentation was fantastic and only added to the appeal. On the plate were these salted seaweed pieces that added just the right amount of compliment to bring out the flavours.


The Tsukune was a make shift chicken drum stick. It is pretty much ground up chicken with spices added and then re-pressed on to a tongue-depressor like stick. Surprisingly quite delicious even though it reminded me of eating a corn dog at the local fair but with a presentation made for a connoisseur of corn dogs.


Lastly, my favourite item of all, the Kobe beef tendon. Words can not describe the best tendon that I've ever had any where. For those of you who are not a huge fan of soft squishiness in your mouth, I would avoid this dish, but for those of you who can appreciate tendon this is a must have and if anything, the one and only reason to visit Raku a second time. The most tender and well proportioned piece of tendon skewered and grilled. The flavour was perfect with a hint of the grill and simply melted in your mouth. I highly recommend this.


The overall cost of the visit was just over a hundred for two of us including two beers and about 6 tapas. This is a great place and despite being off the strip and in a bit of a shady neighbourhood (which I'm sure it wasn't, it was just my impression) I would definitely recommend a visit. Compared to the strip and its similar offerings, Raku beats them all out by far.

I do know that Raku is doing a lot right when it comes to incredibly delicious dishes!...they are probably ahead of me in spreading the spirit of nurturing rightness. I'm okay with that, but if you haven't shared in this experience you might want to get in on what they're nurturing over there because it is downright scrumptious!

Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup (I adore this...one of those items you crave days later)
Cold Green Tea Soba with Poarched Egg
Kurobuta Pork Cheek

Yellowtail Carpaccio
Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard

Agedashi Tofu
Ken² Salad
Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi
Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic
Butter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce

No visit would be complete with a few orders of their skewered veggies & mushrooms...you can get them wrapped in bacon, but they are beautiful on their own.

Dessert offers some excellent options, including Melting Chocolate Cake and Green Tea Crème Brulée...but if you've taken the time to come here why not spend a little more time in the same shopping center and go to Sweets Raku for a complete experience?...unless you ate too much at Raku of course. Oh, and speaking of complete experiences, you can always opt to partake in one of their Omakase options that go for $75 or $100 per person.

Be sure to check out the special board for some truly pleasing selections...these will typically run you a little more, but are often incredible.  There are places I like as much as Raku, but not many that I like more for my money...it is easy in this town to spend two or three times as much for the same quality and execution of food. In fact I'm not sure I'd argue with someone that said Raku is the best for the money in Vegas.

The special Hamburg steak was tough and the sauce was too sweet, and there was way too much for that one meatball-like Hamburg steak.

The oyako don has gobo (burdock root) in it, there wasn't enough soup and the gobo didn't complement the other flavors too well.

The yellowtail carpaccio was a bit slimy and underwhelming. Yuzu kosho is a good flavor complement to the fish, but the other thing (momiji oroshi?) lacked much of a kick.

Some good dishes were the Tofu with the chili and takana (forget its name), the chicken tebasaki/wing, the udon with foie gras steamed egg soup. 

Overall, not a bad experience but it took 2 hours for three of us to finish the dinner, and the food was decent at best. Didn't get drinks so I can't comment. We sat in the private room in the back which was nice, but it did start to get warm.

One tip if you do decide to eat here: the food takes a while to come, so don't over-order. Otherwise, you start to get full before the last dishes come, just because it took about an hour and a half for the rice bowls to come.",fMTT_T57XXk0GbT_frG7ug,3,0,3,eecB_HJvirnVmDYU6cTq_g

- Yellowtail Carpaccio
- Poached egg with uni and salmon roe
- Steamed foie gras egg custard
- Kobe beef fillet with wasabi: We had to order this with all of the reviews that mentioned it, but it didn't live up to the hype. :( Good but not phenomenal.

- Duck with balsamic soy sauce: very tasty!
- Butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce

It can be difficult to see Raku from the street, where it is tucked away. In my mind I am calling the neighborhood Little Asia because the retail and dining options of China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and more all merge together in shiny brightly lit strip malls merging as one long neon streak as your taxi zooms toward its destination.

Our server's husband was sitting at the bar with us, and it turns out he is a sake rep. It was a bit like sitting with our own personal sake sommelier. He works for World Sake Imports, and kindly and deftly guided us through a couple of beautiful sakes. I really have never met a sake I didn't like, so I am an easy and willing victim. We started with a 10 oz bottle of """" Dewazakura ""Sakura Boy"". Light and lovely, without any of the distinguishing melon flavors I sometimes love in a cold sake. This was slightly dry and linear and it was great.

Over our shoulder, we spied someone eating a beautiful giant squid dish that was not on the regular menu. The main body of the squid was served as sashimi, while the upper tentacles were marinated and grilled.  I love a little squid sashimi, and this was not a little. It can be hard to chew, so be careful how much you put in your mouth at once.  The tentacles were marvelous however, and we had no problem gobbling these down.

Another item not on the regular menu you will find online, is a Kurobuta pork belly in a dark sauce. Delicious and incredibly fatty. In most western restaurants I find the pork belly to be cooked so that the fat is served more solid. The flavors here are delicious, but the meat fell from the flesh readily making it easy to separate the muscle from fat. Please, don't hate me. Each bite was still thoroughly embedded in silky fatty flavorful tissue. However, the amount of fat in the dish altogether was a little overwhelming. Bitter greens on the side were psychotically and deliciously infused with fat and sauce. My mouth waters for them.

Hands down my favorite dish of the evening was the agedashi tofu. ZOMG. What? How have I never had this before? Where can I get a Los Angeleno equivalent? The soft tofu here is homemade, served in a hot savory/sweet broth with green onions, ginger and ikura on top. I want a vat of this. I want to roll around in it like a dog. Want.

The second bottle our new friend suggested was Dewasansan Junmai Ginjo. This bottle exhibited more of the fruitlike flavors I love. It is so beautiful I treated myself to a glass a couple nights later at Restaurant Charlie, despite the fact that Trotter's booze mark up is ass-rapingly ridiculous. $40 for a glass of Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label. Really? I understand a healthy booze mark-up to cover costs, but Trotter may have lost his mind a little. I digress. This is a fantastic sake, anytime, anywhere at any price (kinda).

The last item we nommed on was suggested by our friend the sake rep. A chicken breast wrapped in skin, from the robata.This was outstanding. The most succulent, tantalizing piece of chicken I have ever put in my mouth. It needed no sauce and no formal introduction.
Such a beautiful little breast of chicken, protected from the hot fires of the grill by an insulating piece of chicken skin.

I was sent to Raku by Tony of Sinosoul, as a sort-of challenge. He has deep disdain for The Open Door Izakaya in Monterey Park, and I liked it quite a bit. My answer to this challenge is that one cannot compare The Open Door to Raku, it is apples to oranges. The Open Door is a lovely little spot for fairly white-washed but yummy Japanese pub food. Raku is excellent, much more authentic food of the same genre but perhaps not always to the tastes of people who enjoy their food less exotic.",nffEoRhzQYVIL3Y6bFhcGA,4,4,5,PABnaOuONLYrMUYpbRwrxA

First of all, definitely call in advance to make a reservation. I called about a week and a half before my trip and the earliest availability was 11 PM on Friday. If Raku hadn't come so highly recommended to me, I probably would have just passed. But I decided to embrace the ~Vegas lifestyle~ and eat a late dinner here...and I am SO glad I did.

Although located in a strip mall, the interior is sleek and intimate. The staff here are phenomenal -- super accommodating and kind. This is a small-plate style restaurant, so you'll want to order several dishes to share among your table. 

The food here is just incredible. My dining companion and I ordered the tofu, garlic kobe beef, yellowtail with glazed soy sauce, chicken breast, okra, and juicy deep-fried chicken. The tofu was a silky dream, the kobe was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and I could have ordered 10 pieces of the yellowtail and left happy. Even the simple chicken breast and okra were flavorful and cooked perfectly. The fried chicken was delicately fried, served on a bed of spinach, and simply divine. The table is also equipped with green tea sea salt and homemade soy sauce, both of which were perfect additions to the food.

Raku Tofu- half portion was plenty between me and the hubs.  Silky and smooth tofu accompanied with ground ginger, fresh chopped green scallions and what I think was thinly fried onion pieces.  The waitress told us to start off eating it with a bit of the green tea salt available at the table.  Then to eat it with all the toppings and drizzle some soy sauce on top.  So good with the ginger, scallions and onions!  

Agedashi Tofu- half portion. This tofu is exactly the same as the raku tofu in consistency but came in some delicious sauce and lightly fried.  One of my favorite dishes of the night.

Juicy Deep Fried Chicken- nom nom nom!  Super juicy chicken with the perfect amount of crispy, oily skin. 

Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic- tender with a great charcoal flavor.  Couldn't taste much of the garlic or seasoning.  I probably wouldn't get this again.

Kurobuta Pork Cheek- I could eat ten skewers of these myself!  Packed with flavor, tender, with a good amount of fat that made it even better.

Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-Sauce- delish but oh so expensive!  Small little skewer for about $17.  Was it worth it?  Yes!  

Pork Belly- I was expecting seared pork belly but this was more like a braised dish.  The pork could have been more tender.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but just not what I was expecting.  

The hubs and I shared everything and was crazy stuffed by the end of the meal.  Extremely attentive service and the staff took their time in explaining the dishes when they brought them out.  It was a bit hard to make reservations.  I had to call a couple times before someone answered.  I tried multiple times after in attempts to change my reservation time, but was unsuccessful.

I am not usually a fan of soy sauce, but they make their own and this stuff was just divine.  It wasn't too salty and had such a beautiful savory flavor, almost like an aged imperial stout.  On the homemade tofu, I couldn't get enough!  Out of the other ten dishes, most of which I am not that familiar with, a few really stuck out.  The sauteed mushrooms tasted like a finely grilled filet mignon.  The outside was perfectly seared (a technique that they seem to use on a lot of their grilled items), and the flavor was simply heaven.  The kobe beef with homemade wasabi was also a huge hit, possibly the best I have had.  The sashimi was also top notch, although I wouldn't say it was better than Marssa.  The muscles with caviar were also amazingly good.   

This was an amazing experience, and I would recommend it to everyone.  Even non-Asian food lovers will enjoy this place.  I am docking Raku a star for service though.  I had accidentally made reservations for 6, but only 5 of us showed.   Raku was unforgiving of this mistake and we had to flip the bill for the missing person.  The host was quite irritated and not at all apologetic.  Also, after our dinner was finished we were asked to leave to make room, again non-apologetically.

Raku is one of the off-Strip Las Vegas restaurants I hear most about. Raku's charcoal-grilled robata is one of the restaurant's specialties, but they also offer a variety of fresh fish and an assortment of cold and hot plates. Before going in, I asked around for recommendations and the answers I got spanned the whole menu. Clearly, the restaurant does a lot of things well.

We ordered a bunch of things in no particular order, but started with an amuse from the kitchen.

Taiwanese spinach, enoki mushrooms, shitake mushrooms, bonito flakes - Light and refreshing, this was a nice start to the meal.

Bluefin Tuna Sashimi - The restaurant has a chalkboard of daily specials, and this was one of them. Oh my goodness...this was fantastic. Exceptionally flavored and really tender, this was so good. Easily better than much of the toro (and this wasn't toro) I've had in other restaurants; it briefly reminded me of Urasawa.

Agedashi Tofu - This homemade tofu was very good - soft and delicate with a subtle but present soy flavor. Prepared agedashi style, the umami-rich broth was also very good.

Crispy Fried Shrimp - The shrimp here were crispy as advertised and moist on the inside. Nothing special really, but good. I'm never really sure if I'm supposed to eat these sort of things in its entirety, shell-on; but we did in this case.

Crispy Asparagus Okaki - Another crispy dish, I enjoyed the contrasting tenderness of the asparagus with the crispy rice cracker breading. There was a nuttiness to the breading, which I thought also went well with the vegetable.

Juicy Deep Fried Chicken - This was a little bit unique as it seemed to be chicken that was rolled up, then fried and cut. Juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside - no complaints here.

Yellowtail Carpaccio - The fish was good here, but the bluefin spoiled me a bit as it didn't seem as special. Still, the wasabi and yuzukosho did a nice job of brightening up the yellowtail in this dish.

Fish of the Day - Yellowback Seabream - This was one of the fish of the day, served whole. It was a pretty small dish with only about 8 chunks of white flesh. It was very good though, with a crispy exterior from the deep frying.

Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard - The custard was silky smooth with a fairly subtle foie gras flavor. Very comforting. The piece of duck breast on top was pretty good too.

We proceeded with a number of robata-grilled dishes.

Butter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce - The scallop (served in its shell) was cooked well, but I thought the butter was a little overpowering here.

Chicken Thigh - This was the first piece where I could really get a sense of the charcoal grill flavor. There was a smoky char on the chicken, and it was moist and flavorful. Really simple and really good.

Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi - Again, a good smoky flavor from the grill paired with some really flavorful tenderloin. Surprisingly juicy and flavorful. I liked the fresh wasabi as well, countering the rich meat. Delicious!

Kurobuta Pork Cheek - I was surprised to find this rather chewy, kind of like a chicken gizzard. Maybe I just haven't really had cheek in this type of preparation. It was well-marbled, and the porky flavor was present.

Kobe Beef Tendon - Not my favorite. I never really like the tendon though, and this was like a big blob of gooey tendon. So meltingly tender, I wasn't sure if I was biting into fat or tendon. I think this was probably a very good preparation, but it's not my thing.

Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce - An interesting dish here - the duck was prepared well, and the balsamic soy and fresh onions did a good job of cutting through some of the richness.

Apple Marinated Lamb Chop - Tender and juicy, this was a damn good lamb chop. I'm not sure if I got any apple flavor though, but I didn't mind.

Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic - Really good. Exceedingly tender and flavorful, with a nice garlic touch.

I had high expectations for Raku and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, it exceeded them. After dining at places from Joel Robuchon and Jose Andres, it was nice to get something rather simple with clean, familiar flavors. Almost like a detox, if you will. The raw fish preparations (ooh the bluefin!) and the robata-grilled items stood out most to me, but it was a well-rounded meal.",WhCtEF8OyymlwMLDiIffMg,3,5,4,44Kgo449ooR0gMxb4Sqf9A

First, the ambience of the place was incredible. They really nailed what they wanted to achieve. It's located in Chinatown so it looks like a dump from the outside but on the inside, it looks like a 5-star restaurant. Go figure? 

Service is excellent although I REALLY wish they spoke clearer English or if they can not, maybe pictures on the menu or something to better communicate what you are actually eating. The food was excellent across the board but I cant really tell you what I ate. I ordered the $100 tasting menu so it just kept coming out and even after telling me 3x what they were serving, I could not understand what they were saying and the menu wasn't helpful either. So who knows what we ate from the chef's tasting menu but it was all delicious and certainly memorable. Would have been MORE memorable if I knew what I ate is all. 

So the restaurant has great ambience, great food, and a memorable selection. Three for three on my scale. The only two problems are the dessert and the price. After having such amazing food throughout the tasting menu (which takes about 2 hours by the way ... another small gripe), they served me what looked and tasted like an orange popsicle for dessert? Really? $200+ meal and I get a crushed up popsicle that was orange? They seemed surprised that I did not like it ... as if everyone wants a popsicle for dessert. Bizarre. Maybe the desserts are good here but on the tasting menu, they did not give me much of a choice. That may seem like a small thing but when you spend that kind of money off the strip, your standards are way high and it just was a real sour note on the whole meal. 

Secondly, the price. I actually at the end of the day think the tasting menu was worth the money. The problem is that it's off the strip and in Chinatown. It's so hard to feel good about shelling out so much money again. Maybe there is a way to go back and order a la carte cheaper, I don't know. But overall I think it's just a tad bit expensive and massively expensive if you consider that Chinatown is one of the most affordable places to eat in all of Las Vegas.",f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,1,0,4,P8H7Ac-0QjJ7gFnDlkWcqg

2721201,2014-04-27,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"We ordered the following items:
Yellow tail sashimi special
Ken Salad
House-made tofu
Grilled Rice Balls
Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi
Pork Cheek
Bacon wrapped Enoki
Green tea creme brulee
Foie Gras Egg Custard
Brown sugar plum sake

A lot of these items are new to me and I think they are greatly designed and well executed. The pork cheek tastes really good, tender, juicy/fatty and full of flavor. Bacon wrapped enoki is pretty good too, but as it is somewhat quite common and am item hard to mess up. I did not have the sashimi, but I was told it was good. I was told the brown sugar plum sake is one of the best. The Ken salad is well balanced and I like the combinations. The house-made tofu is creamy and smooth. The green tea creme brulee is very tasty as well. 

The cons I can think of include
The Foie Gras is somewhat chewy and tough for some reason. But the egg definitely has good flavor and very tender. 
The Koke beef is somewhat stringy and grainy. I was expect something more juicy and tender. The amount of wasabi is probably too much as well. It overpowers the beef and I can not talk or open my eyes for probably two minutes. 
The entire restaurant is very compact and one table of guests have been talking very loudly over some not very classy topics. But I guess there is nothing you can do about it.

Overall, I like their food. The price is definitely in the $$$ category. Two of us spend $140 on the dinner.",FcxklVcaLYlDO_KDzsRZXw,1,1,5,KlNRCSYHNh8eB13Zpig3lQ

Anyhow good was incredible.  Such attention to detail and ingredient quality.

Started with comp salad of seaweed, bonito flakes and marinade.   Followed by bluefin special (which blew the bank at $35).  8 slices of fish, 5 sashimi and 3 seared.  As tasty and fresh as the sashimi was, the seared slices were amazing.  The fat was slightly emulsified.  So so unctuous.

Had two skewers of chicken gizzards, 1/2 order of rakus tofu which was incredible.  Asparagus coated in panko and deep fried and finally the eringi mushroom which were so meaty and perfectly cooked.  Sprinkled with green tea salt.

Washed down with asahi.  Tab was $63 before tip and worth every penny.  Incredibly I could've gotten a dozen small dishes for that money if I'd passed on the bluefin.  But why?

Been slacking on the reviews and holding off on writing the many reviews of the places I've been recently to have a place deserving of my 200th review.

Raku was the first stop on our long weekend in Vegas for memorial day weekend.  It was a worry that our flight was delayed and our dinner service happened to be scheduled at 1am for a party of 10.  Yes, 1am because our group of foodie friends are a tad crazy but we've accepted that.  Beforehand, we all pretty much decided that we were all going to do the Omakase (theres 2 prices but we went for the premium one $128 including tip/pp) which lasts around 2.5-3 hours so we apologize to the workers who had to accommodate for our group but you've all left a wonderful impression on us.  

Onto the food (in the order as I can best remember):

-Agedashi Tofu: super silky and wonderfully simple (you can take with the green tea salt or with all the fixings on the side
-Grilled tomatoes: simple and sweet with a nice charcoal taste
-Caviar over oysters
-Sashimi: fatty tuna, salmon, hamachi, salmon roe, and at least 2 other types of fish I cannot recall
-Fried soft-shell crab with a side of arugula
-Pork belly
-Kobe beef filet with wasabi
-Pork cheek skewer
-Grilled pork shoulder (the personal favorite for the majority of the guys dining tonight)
-Froie gras over a bed of salad and rice
-Hot Green tea
-Japanese raspberry cheesecake (delicate and light; this was nice as it was a chance to sample Sweet Raku without rearranging our already busy schedule)

Overall the food was delicious and the service was attentive.  I'd definitely go back as it was the meal that stood out the most for my long weekend.",kNT1CgO1Q2Go1BeBqktzRg,0,0,5,K61IVAkinuCWZsitsrQk-A

We were seated to the left of the restaurant.  It felt secluded.  Our group liked that.  

We told the server that we wanted 1 of everything.  First to come out were the juicy fried chicken, poached egg with uni & salmon roe, special of the day: Hamburg, pork cheeks, enoki with bacon, kobe beef with garlic, Kobe with wasabi, scallops, & a few other things. 

The first few bites of everything was quite good.  But as more & more dishes were set in front of us, we really couldn't tell one from another.  The colors and flavors of the foods started blending.  They all started looking & tasting the same.  I got bored (of tasting & taking pictures) really quickly and was actually sorry that we had ordered 1 of everything.  Luckily, the dudes in our group were hungry enough to not let anything go to waste.

However, recently, for some reason, the quality of food has gotten a little worse. Did the head chef leave? I don't know.

 Alcohol beverage used to be much cheaper. Now they are like 'on the Strip' price (some sake is more expensive than these fancy sushi places on the Strip!).

Servers here are way far from professionals. Maybe because i ask too many questions. They are nice, tho.

But these are only negatives. I like it. I like it way better than these mother fuckin fake Japanese fusion restaurants where all the mother fuckin celebrities who cant even use the fuckin chopsticks properly go (nowadays, all they talk about is Jiro Sushi - why don't you go get a pizza, man). 

Oops, excuse me. And yes- one more thing- they have special menu on a black board. Waitresses will recommend you no matter what. I suggest you to ask them the price before you order. It could be ridiculously expensive, tho, you may be too drunk to even care at the end. They are all good, tho.

Tofu is great. 
Best part is they serve seasonal things. 
Ask your server where your fish, uni, and veggie came from. 
Ask what is seasonal right now (it's now time for Matsutake mushroom,,,).
When winter comes, Oden is a great choice.
Best part- they don't have Edamame. That's for fakers, you know.
Crispy asparagus - yummy!


Btw, when you eat, you shouldnt drink unfiltered sake (as apperitive drink, it is ok. It  taste too much, almost too soft and sweet to pair with food - this is a fucking basic rule, dude).Nobody at the restaurant tells you that, but it looks kinda funny.

This place is off the strip, so it takes some effort to get to...believe me, make the effort. It is in an unassuming corner suite of a strip mall. You'd have to know it was here to find it...I am glad I did my research.

I sat at the sushi bar...watching the chef cut whole fish into sashimi was nothing short of entertainment. I was not in the mood for sushi, although the preparation almost convinced me. I went instead to some comforting grilled (Yakitori) dishes. They were all superb...notably the yellowtail with a balsamic-miso glaze! Melt in your mouth awesome!

homemade tofu -- made by the hands of an eighty-year old japanese granny (alright, i dont know who made e tofu, but its good) -- dipped in egg, fried to a fluffy pillow of goodness and floating amongst ikura in a soy-based broth.

imagine rolling the tofu in ur mouth against the ikura -- its like an explosion of textures and flavors. 

i think i jizzed in my pants. 

the fluffy cheesecake was another star. its more mousse-like than to cake but still very good. the tofu and cheesecake alone are worth 5 stars.

We had a taste of a few items from each section (appetizers, robata grill, and noodles/rice/soups), and can hardly wait to return for more.

""Sashimi Salad""
Fresh slice of the sea
Deep-fried onions paired with greens
Perfect start to meal

""Agedashi Tofu""
House made soybean dream
Amazing broth, chili, roe

""Apple Marinated Lamb Chop""
Succulent two chops
Aromatically juicy
No shame to gnaw bone

""Soboro Don- Seasoned Ground Chicken""
Quail yolk atop rice
Mix ingredients and share
Comfort food at its best

""Grilled rice ball""
Two nuggets of art
Fragrant mint countervailed with crunch
Complements all meats

Crispy rice coating
Perfect balance in texture
Veggie laced with crack

2854916,2015-11-08,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"(I wanted to take away half a star, but I'm not sure how to do a half star, and between 4 stars or 5, Raku definitely deserves 5.  Read carefully below to understand why it failed...)

There are destination restaurants, and then there are pilgrimage worthy Temples of Flavour, Fragrance, and Texture: food so good you think about arranging days worth of travel just for the gustatory excitement that satisfies to the very soul... 

Most destination places have one or maybe two dishes that are the stuff of dreams - flavours that you find yourself craving every once in awhile, that you make time for.

Raku, in my first visit, delivered 5 such dishes, with the 6th very nearly to that transcendent level...and looking at the menu, both fixed and ""daily specials"" hand written on a portable chalk board, I see at least 5 others that would likely qualify, probably more...I was heartbroken that I was too full, being a solo diner, to try everything my eyes told me I should try, from the menu, and herein lies the one failure of the restaurant that would keep it from an unequivocal, pure 5 star experience - 

I walked in as a single diner, being in Las Vegas for SEMA and having overdosed on crowds...

They have a 5 seat bar counter area, where you can see the chefs prepare the cold dishes, and can look into the kitchen, essentially a ""chef's table"" or counter.  This had one open seat.  They asked me to wait in the ""waiting area"" - a separate unmanned bar counter area which serves as a ""holding area"" for guests before being seated, very important as the entire restaurant is fairly small and tight.

Ok, so I had to wait even though the one seat was open and set already at the counter...the wait wasn't too long and though I find it silly to make a guest wait when a seat or table is clearly open and ready, I accept that there might be considerations beyond the obvious.  For this I would not have docked them the half star.

As I waited, another single came in, and was told to wait as well. We struck up a conversation; we both were there for SEMA and we both heard about the place online or through friend(s) and decided to venture out alone.  Two foodies, visiting from out of town, dining alone (but not necessarily by preference or choice)  

I was soon called to my seat - the very seat that was already open and set when I walked in.  The other four seats were occupied by two pairs, which meant that two seats would open up at the same time, but not singles.  It looked like they were nearly done, both pairs, but who knows? they might be there for hours more, lingering...fair enough.

After I was seated, and I had a chance to peruse the menu, I had a light bulb moment - if I and my newfound friend were seated next to each other, we could order more and share, so we might experience a wider variety of what looked like incredible dishes just begging to be tried by first time visitors.  So I asked...

Having been to Japan many times and having decades of experience dealing with Japanese and the Japanese culture both in and out of Japan, I understand their deep seated respect, even reverence, for rules.  This is manifest even in something as simple as the orderly way an entire seated waiting line all rise, move over one, and then sit down again, to wait some more...

Ok, I am ok with this. I prefer order over chaos. What I had a problem with was, when I specifically explained to my server, ""I do not mind waiting; I do not mind if you seat another single who comes in later, first; I just would like to sit next to my new friend so we can order more dishes to try a wider variety of your wonderful dishes.""

The explanation was a polite but VERY firm, ""sorry, we cannot do that.""

I even tried to ask, ""do you have a reservation for another twosome for the counter?"" since there were also tables open and available. The answer was no, but still, ""no, we cannot do that.""

Yes of course I understand there might be considerations extant I didn't see or understand, but in the end, the reality trumps all - after I was seated, as a single, at one end; the twosome at the other end finished and left about 5 minutes later. Another single had arrived in the meantime, and of course the two of them (two singles) were seated together on the other end.

As it turned out, my request would have accommodated everyone perfectly, including the newly arrived single, no problems...so it was a ""rule"" that was enforced blindly without any other consideration or reason, even though a more optimal result was offered and dismissed.

Frustrating, especially considering the other 5 or 6 other dishes I really really wanted to try, but oh, well...

But all in all, the service was otherwise excellent or better.

Now onto the incredible, mind blowing food...

What was so amazing was that none of the dishes were new or unique; I had tried them, many times, at many other places. But here, the tastes were pure; the ingredients the very best money and access can appropriate.",IC20CJi3IypifFZQkR2RSQ,2,1,5,jy4_GaM_mqDl7LQbBzslSQ

I heard it's really popular and always packed at earlier times. Calling ahead for a reservation is highly recommended. In general, the food is great but the ambience seemed a bit dreary to me. Maybe because it was midnight and the servers seem tired and the place is a bit lacking in energy. At least, they had that cool little aquarium in one of the bathrooms.

Now, back to the food. The presentation of our sashimi platter was great and the fish seemed at its freshest. It had salmon, roe, tuna, kanpachi and toro in the middle. The kobe beef tataki was excellent. The lambchops from the robatayaki menu were not gamey at all. Instead you get a sweet smokey flavor. If you don't like lamb, this might change your mind.

I managed to squeeze in desserts. Thank you hollow leg! The green tea creme brulee was yummy, as expected. The surprise was their fluffy cheesecake. It's almost the consistency of foam on top of a paper thin cake. The lightest cheesecake ever.

2. Pork Belly (delicious if you're into pork but can be overwhelming)
3. Juicy crispy chicken (it was deep fried and came at the end. It wasn't my favorite)

While all of the items we shared were good, the Duck with Balsamic Sauce and Udon Noodle with Foie Gras and Egg Custard soup were my favorites. The flavor of foie Gras was well infused in the egg custard soup and dipping the Udon in the soup created a heavenly bite that burst forth with goodness in your mouth.

Since the secret of Raku has been out wildly for years now, a reservation is a must. Service can be hit or miss but our server, on this occasion, was attentive and engaging. Their staple dishes are a must to experience at some point, and will actually save you quite a bit of money compared to ordering more of their daily specials, since they can be a bit pricey.

Finished the night off with watermelon and strawberry sorbets. Watermelon one stood out between the two. Overall experience was great, service was too notch.",GkE4Yjsdups0YIt5PiJihQ,0,0,4,lUN_acWCA-ljIrjmFGRo5Q

http://www.yelp.com/biz/kabuto-las-vegas#hrid:aMqNGHz303gGDNb2U9FG_Q

After this trip, I'm really going to focus on finding great restaurants off the strip since there are so many great restaurants at much more reasonable prices off the strip.

Raku is a fancy take on a traditional izakaya and is some of the best representation of the genre that I've had.  Service was attentive, even though it took a little bit for them to warm up and get our orders going.  

We shared a number of dishes and that's really the only way to eat at a place like this.  Order a bunch of small plates and robata yaki items and just indulge.  Some of the highlights for me in no particular order were:

- Housemade tofu (both cold and agedashi tofu styles)
- Pork cheek skewer (a great alternative to the typical pork belly as this has more of an even marbling making)

- Sukiyaki with Australian A5 wagyu  (There was only 3 ounces of the wagyu and that is really all was needed.  The slices were served cooking gently in the pot and were ready to eat within seconds.  With the fat content of the A5, it really doesn't hurt to have it just cooked through because you do want that fat to melt in your mouth.  Normally I would never let my beef slices get past a pink/medium.)

- Foie skewer with soy glaze (The glaze was a bit too much for my taste, but coming from California, I'll take all the foie I can get)

A couple of items weren't as exciting, but that is what makes the small plates format of an izakaya so nice because you are bound to find something you like.  The tsukune and foie custard were a bit disappointing.  The tsukune definitely lacked flavor, but was very tender considering it was pure ground white meat chicken.  I will judge all tsukune by those served by Shinsengumi in LA and this was definitely a cut below.  The foie custard sounded like it should be a hit, but sadly lacked foie flavor and wasn't as delicate as most good chawanmushis.

All in all, this is definitely a recommended detour from the strip.  You aren't going to get food like this at a reasonable price on the strip.  Be sure to make reservations well ahead and get yourself out here.",-eQGJR-tbTOJQ5uEISh57w,0,0,4,FuKD244HrwtFLle04vNwSg

3015131,2010-03-24,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku is the type of restaurant that takes you out of Vegas and into a corner restaurant in Japan.  This is the most authentic Japanese cuisine that we've tried, and a nice change from the regular Japanese ramen and tempura that I usually love.

First, the other yelpers are right--you do need a reservation to eat there, not matter what the day or time.  They are only open for dinner and open till 3am, so call that same day or in advance.  Even if one seat is open and you come in without a reservation they may turn you away, so keep that in mind.

We walked in at 730 this evening and it was a full restaurant.  I assumed that it would be a yakitori restaurant, so I checked the menu and ordered a few things, which I'll go through in a minute.  First, the drinks were limited if you aren't drinking sake or beer.  According to our server, all they had for soda was Coke, so my husband had a coke and I had water.  They explained all the specials of the day and their sake specials as well, giving us a few minutes to go through the menu.  

Their menu isn't large, so it's easy to choose a variety of things to try.  Their appetizers are very familiar to me because we went through Japan and had some of these things like cow intestines and sea urchin.  The grilled menu is nice and short, but with lots of variety, as is their soup and rice bowl sections.  Here's what we ordered:

-Fried chicken appetizer: very interesting.  They roll a boneless breast up with the skin on and deep fry it till the skin is almost dark brown.  I believe it's marinated slightly in shoyu, so it had good flavor.

-Asparagus tempura: it's my favorite thing out of the entire night!  The coating is small squares of potato or something.  It was delicious!!!

-Potato is dashi: very good broth.  You can't go wrong with dashi and we ate the potato with a spoon.  Very good, and very light.  A wonderful starter.

-Kobe with wasabi: extremely tender and not overpowered with any seasoning.  The flavor of the meat is savory and lovely.  I couldn't see the marbling cause it was grilled well done, but very good.  The wasabi gave it that heat, which was a nice combination.

-Chicken breast: not on a stick like the kobe but sliced and served with a shoyu sauce.  Very tender and very well seasoned.  Here's the thing--in Japan they serve chicken half done in most yakitori places on the street, so when this came with the chicken having a pink center I didn't mind.  If you're the type to shy away from medium-well chicken, this may not be your dish. 

-Duck with balsamic: very nicely grilled so that the duck fat was crispy and melt-in-your-mouth good.  The balsamic was a perfect pairing with the green onion.  Very good yakitori.

-Scallop in butter and miso: very tender, lovely butter flavor and the sauce was excellent.  Served on the scallop's half shell, too.

-Yellowtail: very good and had the usual sauce on it, too. I love grilled yellowtail so this was nice.  Some people think it's sacrilege to do that to yellowtail, but it's really, really good.

-Ice fish: these are small fish, smaller then sardines and they tempura them.  They come in a bowl and it was yummy.  As long as you don't mind eating the little black eyes and tail, you should try it.  I liked it. Salty and you can squeeze some lime on there.  

-Bite size chicken and egg bowl: It looks gross, to be honest, but the flavors are excellent. The rice with the sauce reminds me of how rice tastes when you mix bulgogi sauce in it.  I liked it.  Warning: the egg is placed on the rice raw and then cooked chicken on top with more egg, so it's not fully cooked egg.  It's partially gelatinous still, so if you're weary of that, just a warning.

Everything tasted good and I even ordered another round of the asparagus tempura.  I wanted their fluffy cheesecake, but it takes 20 minutes to make, so if you want to try it when you go order it in advance.

Overall, it was a nice flashback of Japan and a good experience.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  Our tab was 100 bucks and some change, something I can't go spend daily.  For 2 people that was a lot of food, mind you, but still--I don't like paying 2-9 dollars for ONE skewer or ONE scallop.  

In terms of service, it's fairly good. They clear you table throughout the whole experience, which is nice.  You need to put your glass out to the outside of the table to get refills of water, but you must ask for refills on Coke.  it's by the bottle.  We had to ask for our check once, and when it didn't come we just gave another server our credit card.  Other than that, their service during the entire meal is really good.  They even walk you out the door, which I thought was pleasant.

If I want yakitori, I'll go to Shisen, but if you want that authentic Japanese experience you have to try this place.  It's good, but  the only thing I loved was the asparagus appetizer.  Sorry to say, but the rest was just okay for me, but the flavor profiles were really good.

The tofu was good but really just tasted a little better than normal tofu.... not life changing. The butter scallop was a little overdone. I really did not like the grilled rice ball in broth, the broth tasted like dirty laundry water. I had Kobe beef at a restaurant on the strip the night prior and that beef was so much better.

We did the sake tasting and tried 6 different sakes. They were all chilled and sweet, I would have liked more variation.

Very pretty.  

The regular menu has many treats, and the prices are really very low, though of course the portions are equally small.  Much of the menu consists of robata-grilled skewer dishes, so they're fairly small, but they also mostly run about $4 or $5, with the really expensive things being stuff like Kobe beef or Foie gras.   Something especially of note is the agedashi tofu, which is insanely good.  Even if you don't like tofu, you'll like this tofu.  The special menu is where lots of interesting things are, which are different every day.  Of note was a squid dish whose name I can't recall, but was amazing.

Chicken breast with chicken Skin was amazing, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon was good, Kobe beef with wasabi was good, absolutely loved the duck skewers, and adored the agedashi tofu.

- Kobe beef liver - liver is high in iron which I need so I ordered this . It was so soft and good . Think it's left a little raw inside .

- Eringi mushrooms - juicy and succulent .

- Asparagus and okra - asparagus was in a rice breading it was so delicioso . I was not a fan of the okra it didn't have good flavor . 

- Salmon with ikura oroshi- was delicious but I've had softer melt in your mouth salmon .

- Yellowtail - outside sauce was good - wish the flavor soaked into the fish because it was dry . 

- Shrimp - we had a plate full of shrimp with the full shell still on . I tried to eat it whole and its edible but not enjoyable so I sat there peeling shrimp lol . But it was worth it ; very tasty shrimp .

My native cuisine, Vietnamese, undoubtedly shares some common ingredients with Japanese but the philosophies of the two are quite different from one another.  Vietnamese cuisine prioritizes the boldness of flavors whereas Japanese cuisine respects the quality of ingredients.  Either way, it took me some time to fall in love with the latter.

Now that Japanese food is such a favorite lover, it's difficult to only settle for mediocre encounters.  So I'm thankful to have had a rendezvous with Raku one Friday evening, since the exquisite tastes of that rendezvous have left me wanting more.  

I couldn't help but think of the restaurant's decor in terms of a woman, who is stunningly beautiful but dressed in a sophisticated manner.  The restraint in sultriness also resonates in the food, presented like a Thakoon silk gown draped across the body of Thandie Newton (for those who cannot extract a vision, google the gorgeous actress).  

Beyond the presentation, the food tastes of superior quality that combined opposites of flavors.  Grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce was buttery but clean.  Sashimi salad had spinach and fresh fish that were fresh, crunchy, tender, and savory.  Cold tofu and hot tofu were rich but airy, and melted in your mouth like pudding.

We ordered similar items as last time, with 1-2 different items:
(1) Kobe beef filet $10.50 - tender cubes of kobe beef on a skewer with some wasabi spread on top. yummy!
(2) Fried Pork ears $3 - my husband loves pig ear and we ordered 2 orders of it, haha
(3) Foie gras $17.50, we were craving foie gras since this is banned in California, so Vegas is the closest state near us where we can order a serving of foie gras! the flavor was the same as last time, but for some reason - the foie gras size got smaller. :( boo
(4) Enoki mushroom wrapped w/ bacon, hooray - so tasty, only comes with 2 servings (cut in half); wish there was more! i wish i could cook this at home on my own since the way they prepared it was just scrumptious.
(5) Poached egg w/ sea urchin, salmon roe $9, if you only get one dish here -make it this dish.
(6) Yellowtail w/ soy $8 - so delicate, so delicious, and absolutely flavorful w/ sweet/salty soy-based sauce
(7) Scallops - served in the shell and the juice/onion concoction was great. the scallop itself was overcooked though in my opinion

We always sit at the bar, watch the chefs make their beautiful delicious seafood preparations, and just enjoy a good meal. We had to wait about 10-15 min before we got seated, since we didn't come with reservations made.

Raku! 

Well what can I say? Obviously, people working in the restaurant industry have very good and discerning taste. 

If you come to Raku expecting to eat maki rolls, you will be disappointed. Japanese cuisine is so much more beyond maki rolls. No, Japanese don't eat sushi everyday.

Raku has many items as part of the daily special that are written on a portable blackboard. Our server brought the board to our table and went through each of them. We ended up ordering many items from the specials because they were too good to pass up on.

Highlights from the specials:

*Seigo (Japanese sea bass)*
Choose 2 out of 3 methods of preparation: sashimi, grilled, fried.
The order is for a whole fish. Based on our chosen method of sashimi and grilled, half of it was delicately sliced into sashimi. The other half was grilled to perfection (head and tail included)

*Bai gai (Japanese sea snail)*
Such beautiful snail shells! Our server told us that the snails are first cooked for 7-8 hrs until tender and then they are steamed to order.

*Kushi (Kobe beef tongue)*
Small pieces came on a yakitori stick. Drizzled with intensely flavorful sauce.

*Kakuni (pork belly)*
Braised until very tender. We ate up both meat and fat without guilt.

Items we ordered from the regular menu which were equally amazing:

*Raku Tofu*
This is their signature housemade tofu. Our server told us that Raku makes their tofu fresh everyday. The tofu was unlike any other we've had. The texture was extremely creamy. It is meant to be sprinkled with some green tea salt made with mushroom and seaweed. And then enjoyed with soy sauce, scallions, and bonito flakes.

*Agedashi Tofu*
Also uses the housemade tofu, slightly fried on the outside, and served with dashi sauce, roe, tiny mushrooms, and Japanese chilli paste on the side.

*Juicy fried chicken*
This is similar to karaage (deep fried chicken cutlets). The chicken was unbelievably moist and it was fried until it just crossed over from rare to cooked. I don't know how the chefs timed it that well, but it sure prevented an overcooked and dry meat.

*Oden (fish cakes)*
We selected several types of fish cakes that were served in dashi broth. Other items we chose were daikon and pork intestines. Oden is especially popular in winter in Japan.

If you're visiting Vegas and have no access to a car like us, we hopped into a cab from our hotel and Raku is just a short ride away. We called for a cab after we were done with dinner. No hassle. Make reservations!",-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,3,0,5,4SzDGgJqhDR5N3wJk1Op1g

Kanpachi fish is a greater amberjack. I sat at the sushi bar and the fish was meticulously sliced and prepared in front of me - so awesome to watch. Service was quick too. My check came to under $50. You never get this quality food nor service on the strip. Coming back again on my next Vegas trip.",nNiCBm2uoyqki9BrJ6G-UA,1,1,5,PDZZo2aVdzgQ64IFKYe6Yg
3108058,2013-03-21,9,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"You have heard about this place, probably.  There is a lot of hype.  You know what?  Not goddamned worth the hype at all.  I think it was good in the past, and then they decided to become aloof pricks with mediocre food, and rest on the hype.  

Now listen... I spend about $5,000 a month eating out.  Yes, really.  I think nothing of dropping $1,000 on dinner for two.  This place was $200 for two of us, and I wish we had gone to In and Out Burger and left a $190 tip.  Service sucks.  

Let me reiterate that.  THE SERVICE SUCKS.  Worse than anywhere I've been in Vegas.  Sucks.  Sucks.  Sucks.  

Tough to get a reservation here. You know why?  Not because it is so good, but because there are 7 tables.  There are also 3 waitresses, and they are all idiots.  They are very nice idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  The service sucked.  Sucked bad.  Sucked like, so bad that we considered leaving to go to in and out burger.  Sucked so bad that I usually tip 25-30%, much to the chagrin of my wife.  I tipped 2.5%, and it made me sick to even tip that much.  I only tipped that much because I did not want them to think that I merely neglected to tip.  If I could have tipped with a piece of dog shit instead, I would have. 

The food -- mediocre.  Not bad.  Not great.  There are some things on the menu that are pretty awesome -- the sea urchin dishes are something special, but only special because sea urchin is great.  Nothing you can't tell any sushi chef anywhere in the world to throw together for you.  The food is just really uninspired.  I didn't eat anything that I said ""eww,"" gross -- except the one dish that came with the waitress' hair in it.  But, you know, mistakes happen.  But honestly, the food is just ""meh.""  I mean, for a few hundred bucks, I can deal with ""meh"" food.  But, if you dont have a $5k expense account to throw away, then I would imagine you'd be pissed off.  

Just lame.  Not terrible food.  Not good.  Just ""matter that you can eat"".  If you want to spend this kind of money and this kind of hassle to eat mediocrity, then be my guest, but this place should just close down.  

The sake selection is pretty good.   But, again, do you want to make a reservation a week in advance so that you have the privilege of asking some dingbat to bring you a bottle of sake, that your date has to pour for you, because Hello Kitty airhead can't be bothered to do her job?  

The plum sake, btw, is horrendous.  It tastes like cough syrup.  but, that's not the restaurant's fault.  Of course, it is the wait staff's fault.  I dont expect them to know everything, but lets play a game -- point to ANYTHING on the menu and ask ""how is this?""  They'll say ""ohhh, my favorite!""  

I would eat here if I were starving to death.  But, the blank mindless stares from everyone who works here come from the complacency of this being the ""hottest asian restaurant in vegas"" a year ago.  Now, it rests on its laurels, which are not deserved.  I'd rather just eat at the gas station across the street.  Well, Its better than gas station sushi.  Its sorta neat, the stuff on the menu.  But, really, its a huge ""fuck you"" as far as I am concerned.  

If you want GREAT ""modern Japanese"" then try Yonaka on Flamingo Road.  MUCH better, MUCH better service, MUCH better EVERYTHING.  I ate there two days ago because I couldn't get a table at Raku.  I was sort of disappointed.  Now, I wish I never got a table a Raku.

I ate with a group of seven. If you have six or more they force you to have the omakase, which was fine with me.

We started with the Raku tofu, which completely changed the way I look at tofu and was my favorite course (though not by much!). It was silky and just solid enough to be eaten with chopsticks. The waitress recommended we eat one of ours with chive, ginger, and soy, and leave the other one plain and dust it with green tea salt. I could eat the plain tofu with green tea salt all day long.

Next we had raw oysters topped with caviar, super fresh sashimi (the lean tuna with some seaweed was my favorite), fried asparagus, scallop, iberico pork skewer (another favorite - heavy charcoal flavor and fatty meat), and filet + wasabi skewer.

For dessert, there was green tea creme brulee with green tea ice cream. Another amazing dish - good green tea flavor and not annoyingly sweet.

Be sure to order the deep fried housemade tofu with salmon roe and this amazing broth! (agedashi tofu) You will not regret it! It is awesome. Another staple for me is the pork cheek skewers. Those are delicious!
Even the simple things like boiled eggs or a kombu broth are good.
I also had my first cold soba noodle experience here and it was great! It was so homey and comforting for something served cold.

I enjoyed 90% of the food. Ambiance is very dark and small. It is semi dressy, although there were a few patrons that were dressed down. It surprises you because it is pretty nice inside, but it's in an Asian plaza that you would not expect to find this place.

Food:
- Blue Fin Tuna : this was too fishy for me, but my dinner company loves tuna and by her standards it was good for her
- Yellow tail Carpaccio: Fresh and served with spicy soy sauce
- Fresh Homemade Tofu: creamy, but not memorable
- Sashimi Salad : great flavor, and one of the highlights of the meal. The fried onions were just right and not overbearing
- Agedashi Tofu: Great flavor, would get again
- Duck with Balsamic : perfect
- Kobe Beef: I can still taste it right now! so tender
- Lamb - Not game tasting at all
- Butter Sauteed Scallop with Soy Sauce: needed to be grilled more, decent, but not a star
- Portabella stuffed with ground chicken : decent, not a star
- Direct Flamed Eggplant: bland
- Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard: what a surprising dish. I didn't eat the Foie Gras because I'm not a fan of it, but the noodle, broth, and egg custard. SPOT ON! 
- Green Tea Creme Brule: wow, melt in your mouth! Green tea ice cream on top of green tea creme Brule. I would have finished this all if I wasn't rushing for the airport. lol

During my last trip to Vegas in January, I wanted to try Raku, but I couldn't get a same day reservation. This last trip, I made sure to call ahead and reserve a spot. We had dinner here on Thursday, July 9th at 10pm. We were a party of 5 and shared everything.

We all got hot tea: Hoji cha tea ($2.50ea) and a bottle of sake to share: Shichihonyari ""seven spears men"", junmai nama genshu, prefecture: shiga ($80 bottle). Description of sake from menu: ""This is a very drinkable but complex limited released unpasteurized sake has the prototypical sake brewery aroma that is like a wet collection of steamed rice, green grasses, yeast and green apples. A nama that actually tastes like rice, which is a rarity these days."" I don't know much about sake, but this was dry enough for me to drink. And I was sold when they said limited release!

Specials:
*Wagyu sashimi ($20)
*Bluefin / Negitoro ($31)
*King crab ($20)

I loved the wagyu and sashimi! These were my favorites out of the specials. The wagyu melted in my mouth and the sashimi was super fresh. I'd skip the king crab next time as it was just a grilled leg. It was good, but nothing special.

Cold dish:
*Kobe beef liver sashimi ($9.50)
*Yellowtail carpaccio ($12)
*Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ($9) x2

Yellowtail carpaccio is a must! So tender. The uni dish is super rich. I enjoyed the first bite, but it needed something to cut through the richness as I continued eating it. I wasn't a fan of the liver sashimi as raw liver isn't really appealing to me.

Hot dish:
*Steamed foie gras egg custard ($10) x2
*Agedashi fish belly: Hamachi belly ($18), Agadashi belly (+$5)

I was in heaven with the steam foie gras custard. Omg! The silky custard with the delicately seared foie?! Sooo good! All flavors I adore. The agedashi fish belly was okay. I thought it wasn't crispy enough and a little mushy. Though I'm not sure if we waited too long to eat it. Sake will do that to you!

Robata grill:
*Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic ($7.50) x3
*Kurobuta pork cheek ($4.25) x3
*Duck with balsamic soy sauce ($4.50) x3
*Foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce ($17.50) x3

For 5 people, 3 skewers per order were perfect. We were here to try a bunch of dishes, so half a skewer allowed for a bite or two of each item. I'm a foie addict, so of course I loved the foie! Seared to perfection. I also loved the pork cheek. Super tender. I also enjoyed the beef and duck. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the skewers they offered. All had a nice smoky flavor and were delicious!

Rice/Noodle/Soup:
*Cold green tea soba with poached egg ($8.50)

This was my least favorite dish. I don't really enjoy cold noodles, so I didn't find this appetizing at all. I think cold noodles are supposed to be refreshing, but I just don't get it. I've enjoyed korean cold noodles from time to time, but they have a nice vinegar and spicy flavor. This didn't have that.

Yay, I finally tried Raku! Did it live up to the hype?! Definitely with certain dishes! I adored all the foie, carpaccio, sashimi and skewers. Some missed the mark for me, but I think it was more about taste preference than anything else. I'm a little sad we didn't try any of their tofu as I believe that is one of their specialties.

We've tried a variety of dishes, many amazing and some mediocre for the high price. My husband loves their Ken salad and I am particularly fond of their selection of skewers, the wagyu beef sashimi, and their cheesecake dessert (seriously, the best ever).

It's about 15 mins from the strip. When I don't have a car, I either lyft or uber... which ever one is cheaper at the moment. If you do drive, parking can be tough because this plaza has a few good eats. 

It's a rather small restaurant. Very dim and intimate. I suggest making reservations a few days in advance if you know you want to go here because it gets busy. Also, if you go with a large group, it will be a prefix menu at a specific price per person. I had to do this for one of my bdays. I forgot how much (maybe $65 or something around there). Good thing is they serve their most popular items. You can even add more food of choice if it wasn't a part of the prefix menu.

Staff is very friendly. Waiters are attentive and helpful in choosing what you might like. They are very knowledgeable in terms of the types of special fish they serve.

This place can get pricey, depending what you order. But you know what they say, you get what you pay for. At raku, it's all GOOD QUALITY ingredients and food. You can tell by the way it tastes.

I had always just ordered the $75 omakase, and I don't know why.  This last visit, I got the $100 omakase, and wow, am I glad that I did.

First off, the waitress this visit was especially warm, friendly, and fun.  If I had one complaint about this place (and I'm really, really reaching here), it's that the service is perhaps a little too ""formal"".  Maybe that's just the Japanese way?  It's not bad or anything, but I like some back and forth with the wait staff, especially after a couple sakes.  Our waitress this time was more than happy to engage in some banter, answer questions, ask the chef questions, recommend and teach me about sake, etc.

The first course was a spiny lobster sashimi.  It arrived whole, with just the tail split and the meat scraped from the shell.  If I wasn't so sure otherwise, I'd swear the thing was still moving.  Fresh as heck.

The other courses were, of course, perfection.  The $100 course includes some more fanciful ingredients, like little baby anchovies (their little eyes freaked my wife out a bit but they taste fantastic) for seasoning the tofu.

What impressed me the most though, was when the spiny lobster CAME BACK!  This time, the front half of the lobster was cooked into a broth, with the tasty-but-usually-inaccessible meat integrated into the soup.  The tamale was also very tasty.

The meal started with a wonderful sashimi salad.  The sashimi pieces were big and the dressing was uniquely good.  Then came the homemade tofu, which had great texture and the homemade soy sauce and sauces complemented it well.  My favorite condiment was the green tea salt with the tofu.

The robata items were perfectly cooked.  The bacon you use to wrap around the mushrooms, asparagus wasn't too salty as is the usual problem for me at other robata restaurants.   The enoki was cooked to a chewy perfection, as was the pork cheek, beef tendon, shishito, chicken wings.  

Of all the items, I think I loved the foie gras egg custard the most.  The texture, the taste, and the presentation.  

The oden soup base was refreshing and you can add items to it a la carte.  We opted for the daikon, chikuwa, bean curd with mochi inside, and uni (which comes separately with wakame).  The meal was ended delightfully with a grilled onigiri in broth.  Perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Thank you!

The menu is mostly skewers/ izakaya type foods.

We had the agadashi tofu, which comes highly recommended. The tofu was crispy on top and the sauce definitely added flavor.

Kobe filet with wasabi - you must get this. It's grilled to perfection and it just melts in your mouth. There's just a hint of wasabi, enough to add that zing and add to the flavor and not over come it.

Duck with balsamic soy sauce.

Kobe skirt with garlic- again melt in your mouth with just enough garlic to add a little flavor. 

Rice ball- grilled crispy rice triangles. One was soy sauce infused, decent

Oyaku don with chicken and egg, this came out last, a great ending to our meal. We did wait a while for our food.

Pork Ears: Grilled, slightly chewy and the cartilage is yummy.

Raku Tofu: In-house fresh tofu turned over onto a plate with the basket's moulding still on the tofu. The tofu comes with very finely minced ginger and green onion. They recommend adding some soy sauce. The tofu is smooth and unbelievably soft. It's the best tofu I've ever had.

Agedashi Tofu: Fried tofu, very light batter, so it's crisp and not tough. It comes on top of a light soy-based sauce.

Conch: This was a special; it was expensive and not particularly tasty. It was also chewy. However, it's nice that they have specials on their blackboard menus, presented by the servers at your table-side.

Chicken wings: The chicken wings are flavorful and grilled on their binchyo charcoal grill. This kind of charcoal really gives the food a different flavor than other charcoal. 

Skewers: There are many different kinds of skewers and they are all grilled on the same type of binchyo charcoal grill. Nothing was disappointing, so you must bring many friends and try all the different skewers they have to offer, from chicken gizzard to bacon wrapped around scallop to shrimp. The skewer section has much to offer.

Oden: I tried two different kinds of oden, but I wouldn't be surprised that all the other odens also taste very delicious. The two that I tried included the one with mochi wrapped in tofu skin with some daikon accompanying this delicious ""rice bag"" and a sweet vegetable broth. The other one was the oden with tendon. The tendon is perfect, comes with daikon also and is in the same vegetable broth. On the side of the oden bowl is a dash of srirracha and a dash of horse radish paste for you to add to the dish up to your liking. 

Chicken Tsukuni: This should be in the skewer section, but it's special enough to be in its own category. It's like chicken meatballs on a skewer and is very addictive. You might want more than one.

Green tea ice cream: good ice cream, weird combo that it came with chocolate sauce, but that might just be me.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,5,2,5,usu63FhMIJ8vcgKLIHaW3g

We ordered so many didferent things. Most memorable was the whole fish which we got half if it sashimi style and the other half portion fried. We should have gotten it all sashimi because it was amazing good and not fishy at all = fresh.
Fried shrimp was good along with the enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon. I kept forgetting to take pictures of some because we got too excited.
Pork belly melted in our mouths and the Toro was chopped up and season with clear jelly like noodles under.

The restaurant is extremely small - book reservations well in advance or you have no shot getting in as a walk-in. The Japanese staff was very courteous and seated me at the sushi bar. The clientele was colorful to say the least - I was sandwiched between a Raku fanatic from the east coast and an Asian girl in a formal white dress who was simply off the hook.

After you're seated, the waitress will bring over a chalkboard with the specials of the day. They're all fresh and worth the money. Fresh fish and meat dishes for the most part.

Tofu is the specialty of the house, and Raku's adedashi tofu is without equal. It comes in a spicy broth with fresh mushrooms, seaweed and salmon eggs on top.

As side dishes I had the crispy asparagus okaki, kurobuta pork cheek, sauteed butter scallop and the kobe beef skirt steak with crispy garlic. They were all fantastic, and I wrapped up the meal with the green tea creme brulee, which was to die for.

Watching the chefs work is one of the charms of Raku. Right before your eyes, they do everything from slicing fresh sashimi to ladeling out bowls of piping hot oden. What's more you can tell they're totally passionate about the cuisine.

Raku is a real Vegas gem, and it's a good cab ride away from the strip. It's worth it.",4S743WSDVTfSXR3ClJnj7A,0,1,5,pwskR6KEStCXoFejxY3vCQ

The order comes with 8 or 9 pieces of tuna, 4 pieces were sashimi and the other 4 or 5 pieces were seared. I don't care for seared tuna and prefer it raw. The fish was very fresh and melted in my mouth as blue fin tuna should. We also had the pork belly and the Agedashi tofu which were both incredible. We also had both versions of the tapa Kobe beef dishes (wasabi & garlic) which were very tender and flavorful. 

The only dish I didn't care much for was the foie gras with rice. The flavor is good but I've never cared much for duck liver but had to try it because of all the great Yelp reviews about it. Don't let me dissuade you from trying it though if you like foie gras. It's just not for me.

Reservations are highly recommended. My friend and I dined in on a weekday and the place was packed. The two of us were overly ecstatic and over-ordered upon being seated: 

We ordered three items off the appetizer section. Raku's tofu is homemade as is the soy sauce. It is a delicacy that should not be skipped. The poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe were very fresh, but I was not a fan of the slimy texture. 
The butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce arrived on half of a clam shell. It was perfectly glazed and seared. 

As for the robata grill, we ordered various skewers. The chicken thigh was not what I wanted but nonetheless, the meat was tender and succulent. The yellowtail glazed with soy-based sauce was done in medium. For $7, it is well worth it and can be shared among two people. The kurobuta pork intestine was exceptionally soft and without a slight sense of gaminess. The kurobuta pork cheek arrived with a shimmer resembling fatty meat. But the texture was crisp and the flavors were perfect. I would definitely order this one again.

It does not end there. We also ordered the Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic and Kobe beef tendon. I am not a big fan of garlic, but I made the exception without regret. If you're feeling in need of collagen, get a skewer of tendon all to yourself. If you are not particularly fond of the soft, gelatin, melt-in-your-mouth texture, share it with somebody!

Last but not least, we ended our meal with the udon with foie gras and egg custard soup. Unlike most thick-cut udon noodles, this one resembles angel hair. The udon is served separately in a tiny basket with a generous piece of foie gras floating atop the bowl of warm broth. I was pretty full from the items above but this was not something to turn away from. 

The damage was done at approximately $50 per person.",U11j0md4DV59nXD6kdb0KA,4,2,5,xqHEil2UuPaV8BpH_1wmXw
3257451,2012-07-15,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I've enjoyed a lot French tasting menus, but my dinner at Raku was only my third Japanese Kaiseki menu.  This was hands down, the best Japanese tasting menu I have had thus far.  When I made my reservation over the phone a few weeks ago, the person I spoke to made sure I knew the 15 course Kaiseki dinner would last over 5 hours-yep, no problem.

We missed Raku on our first drive down the street, but saw it coming back the other direction.  Once they found our reservation, we were taken to a little private room.  Excellent!  No need to worry about our camera flashes distracting anyone in the dark restaurant.  Our server, Andrew, was great.  He explained each course, answered questions, gave us specific suggestions on how to eat certain dishes, and made sure we were enjoying everything. 

The presentation of our first dish was very creative.  In addition to a spoon, a bowl filled with some dashi, roe, and yuzu powder, a paddle and a rectangular box were placed in front of us.  When you push the paddle in one end of the box, the homemade silken tofu came cut out the other side.  Nice.  

The second plate was adorned with 9 different little bites.  Everything on this plate was a hit with me.  I loved the rice cracker covered asparagus, green onion duck with balsamic, salmon & egg yolk, and miso marinated cod.  I was also intrigued by the corn on the ""cob"" where the cob was replaced with mashed potatoes.  

Did I mention they wiped the table between courses?

My friend was just eh about the third dish, but it was so surprising, I think it was one of my favorites from the whole meal.  The clear, cold tomato gel w/ dashi, scallops, shrimp, okra, and soy sauce powder looked uneventful, but when that get hit the top of my mouth, POW!  That was intense, fresh tomato flavor.  Great dish!

The next dish that we devoured was a grilled chicken that came with a charred sweet onion and a little dab of super hot chili pepper.  The chicken skin was crisp and the meat was juicy.  I'm telling you, if people knew how to cook chicken this well, they wouldn't be complaining about eating chicken every day.  Perfect execution.

Hands down THE best dish of the night was the foie gras chawanmushi.  The truffle oil, little cube of foie gras (thank you Nevada) and dashi-custard was so rich.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. Oh man, make me another, and make it an ostrich size, not that little quail egg.  LOVED it!

Another favorite was the steak with garlic, soy, XO sauce, and garlic chips.  The Hennessy flambe was poured on top of the hot rocks at the table.  Great presentation, and fabulous flavor!

We weren't sure if all 15 courses would be savory or if there would be a dessert.  Well, it turned out that there were two parts to our dessert.  First was a yuzu custard brulee with tangerine sorbet & whipped cream.  THAT was a great combination. I loved the tart tangerine with the sweet cream and the smooth custard with the crunch of the melted sugar.  Nice and refreshing. The second part of dessert was a sweet sake topped with heavy cream.  My friend exclaimed that it was, ""The best sake ever!""

As with all tasting menus, there were standout dishes that I couldn't wait to tell people about.  There were several dishes that were good, not bad, but not great, and there were a couple that were okay, but we wouldn't necessarily order them on their own.  There was only one dish that we absolutely did not like.  

Our dinner at Raku was great.  This was only my friend's second tasting menu ever, and he enjoyed it.  I've had way more expensive meals on the strip that didn't satisfy as much as Raku.  The food was delicious, service was on point, and our entire experience was excellent.  Andrew even told us to make sure I use the same contact information when I make my next reservation, so they can make sure we get different dishes.  I don't think that'll be necessary.  Next time I'm coming and ordering ala carte.  Have you looked at their menu?  There are so many yummy sounding dishes.  Plus, I can get a whole bowl of that foie gras chawanmushi!

They were turning away walk ins all evening while we were there. The restaurant atmosphere is wonderful.  Very intimate.  The servers are Japanese, which lends an authentic feel.  We decided to get the omakase menu for $100 a person.  We did not get to see a menu with the courses listed, and it was a bit hard to understand what our servers were saying at times, but we just went with it.

The dishes that we liked were excellent.  The oyster and caviar, the foie gras.
There were some pretty decent dishes, including the tofu, the sashimi dish, and some grilled skewers.  The fish course was decent, but there were some dry parts of the fish along with some delicious, moist pieces.

The disappointment was the pork cheeks.  Very chewy, felt like we were biting into pieces of cartilage.  I couldn't eat mine.

We had simple strawberry ice for dessert, which was OK, but I wished we had something more special.  The table next to us got Sukiyaki as a course and cheesecake as a dessert.  I think they did the $75 a person omakase menu.

We got to the restaurant and they were strict about the reservations.  Thankfully, we were one of the early reservations before people started showing up - around 7:30 the place was packed.  We ordered quite a bit of food - the tofu salad, the pork cheeks, bacon wrapped asparagus, bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, agedashi tofu, oden, and the fluke.  AWESOME.

The waitstaff was pretty authentic - I remember the energy that Japanese servers tend to have, unlike Koreans who are gruff as shit.

When it was first recommended to me, I expected it to be part of the Strip like any other high end eatery, and one that was in the confines of a casino resort. Instead, it is a Japanese establishment in the splendors of Chinatown.

My expectations were surprisingly low the first time around. I haven't had incredible experiences of the Japanese kind in Vegas just yet, plus I was less likely to put faith in a place that was more Asian fusion than pure Japanese as Raku seems to be. And in the seediness of Chinatown no less? I was already beginning to doubt its $$$$ rating.

But thankfully, my expectations were not only met but exceeded in every way. Everything was truly spectacular, from the small plates to the entrees and it was hard to pass up anything considering how fresh and tasty it all was. Stars of the initial evening were bold cuts of sashimi, namely blue fin tuna, coupled by an incredible array of tofu dishes and one dish that would make any seafood lover salivate: fresh uni with salmon roe, topped off by a perfectly poached egg.

It has been several visits since then and all is right with the world. Client dinners have been nothing short of amazing and my personal escapades have resulted in a lot of experimentation with the menu. I've become enamored with a live uni udon, their daily blue crab miso soup, and their array of skewered meats. Kobe beef, chicken skin, and pork cheek have been favorites in all izakaya circles.

Perhaps my expectations were a little high but many dishes we tried didn't have that WOW factor that a truly exceptional restaurant would offer.  However, there were a few standout dishes that would bring me back.

If you are able to get excited over tofu, then you'll love Raku.  You also probably have a low threshold for excitement.  Yes, the tofu was the creamiest and freshest and bestest tofu ever, but it was still just tofu--not the most flavorful of foods.  The Raku Tofu, versus the fried (agedashi) tofu,  is the one to get.
The pork cheek was flavorful and a highlight.  The skirt steak was better than the beef tenderloin.  Know that each order comes with two skewers and if you want to do it up, you'll want several orders, not just one or two.
The cheesecake was unique and amazing--so light that it probably shouldn't be called ""cheesecake.""  It was more like a fresh meringue that tasted like cheesecake.

Service was helpful and friendly.  Despite being told that ""we have to leave after two hours"" when we made our reservation, we weren't rushed or reminded of this policy--then again, we didn't stay longer than two hours.

I like that this serious foodie place is open till 3 am and I can see how chefs and other folks would come here after they close up their kitchens.",WadR9priMWa_HdwY8BhjwQ,2,0,5,QK5B3S5LlGLVD9Kzjhvyow

If you consider yourself a foodie, you must check out this spot. It is an avant garde Japanese restaurant unlike anything else in town. There is no AYCE sushi, or sake machine like you find in other restaurants. Instead, you find a small cozy eatery tucked away on the western part of chinatown.

 The food is minimalistic but delicious. The chef makes his own soy sauce and tofu which is practically unheard of at most Japanese restaurants. There is quite a bit of skewers = ""meat on a stick"" which is totally not a bad thing. The bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms are a must try. The Foie Gras Egg custard Udon noodle Soup is unlike anything I have ever tried. The texture, taste, and quality is something you find at a high-end restaurant on the strip. Similar dishes have been done before but not like this. They offer a large selection of sake which is a often necessary addition to any proper Japanese meal.

More and more people are discovering Raku which usually means that lines and wait times can be long on the weekends. The place is pretty small so the amount of diners is definitely limited. On top of that Raku can get very pricey. Top-shelf ingredients like foie gras, sea urchin, and caviar command higher prices.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,2,1,5,Az5yIXTCfFuXwzX0EcBMYQ

We started off with the house special tofu (both cold and hot)---probably the best dish out of all the plates. The texture of the tofu is out of this world--creamy, yet firm with great flavor! If my love for tofu wasn't already beyond the fence, this dish kicked it out of the world! A MUST. 

We also ordered:
foie gras- super creamy, melts in your mouth
pork cheek-great smokey flavor
asparagus- again great flavor
grilled duck--slightly gamey and chewy
chicken breast with crispy skin-SO SO GOOD. not dry at all, full of flavor
(small bite) chicken and egg-(This is similar to a don bowl, amazing taste and great portion size on top of the tapas)
kobe steak-it's kobe beef! enough said. 
pork ears-crunchy texture and great flavor

An outstanding Seared Foie Gras in a soy based glazed sauce, and although there was evidence of a very small vein, it was so deliciously done, well seared and seasoned, I can certainly overlook it. The Kobe beef with Garlic was tender and so flavorful, the chicken thigh simple but yummy.

On to the service! What the hell raku! We made 4 separate reservations for 4 separate parties all under different names. 3 of the parties got seated on time as scheduled. Ours was the only one with a problem. Apparently the manager who took our reservations had heard reservations for 4 tables but only had the capacity to write down 3 reservations. Walking into the restaurant the night of our reservation, all were excited because of the greatness that was Raku. As we walked up to the hostess podium we said our reservation name and how many. The hostess then went on to tell us that there was no reservation under that name. The other three tables were already seated.... How is it that our reservation was not written down when all 4 reservations were given during the same telephone conversation.....? Uh Duh. Of course the tension quickly grew. The hostess continued to look at her paper saying that there was no such reservation. Obviously someone forgot to write it down. Ever think of that? The manager came and said he was the one that took down the reservation. All that was going through my mind was "" so you're the dumbass that couldn't write down four reservations"" he kept telling us that we had no reservation and looking at the paper. Seriously, does no one at raku understand the situation by now or what?! Eventually the guy redeems himself and gives us a table. However, he ends up separating our table and half of us end up sitting at the bar where guests wait..... Overall, If it wasn't for the misunderstanding I would love raku to bits.

I had heard about Raku as the place all the local chefs go after cooking to enjoy a quality meal from an exceptional chef at reasonable prices. I had also heard about their specials board which is usually a must to order off of. 

We had a sample of about 7 dishes to try as many different creations as possible. The standouts were the agedashe tofu, chicken skewers, and the tuna special. Each dish came out one after another to not overwhelm and give you a chance to experience each on its own. When delivered, the waiter would explain the dish and offer insight into how properly to eat the meal and which sauces to use. 

Overall I greatly enjoyed my meal. I would always recommend to go off the strip for quality food in Las Vegas not just because it's cheaper but because it has local flavor and comfort.

Prior to coming here, one of my friends said that one of his co-workers really enjoyed this place and that we should check it out. I looked it up on Yelp and was surprised that the ratings were so high after so many reviews. I also watched Anthony Bourdain eat here on Parts Unknown (Season 3, Episode 2) and took notes on what he ordered. Also, surprisingly, Andy Hayler, a food critic who has been to almost every Michelin star establishment, went here and gave Raku a glowing review. 

With all that out of the way, on to the review. My friends and I came here after seeing Love at The Mirage. We arrived at around 9:30 PM and parking was hard to find, so we decided park on the street. Raku was full when we arrived, but we waited only about 10 minutes before we were seated. I could go extensively over what we ordered and give lots of details about each item, but I'll give you a cliff notes version.

What we ordered:
- 1/2 Raku Tofu 
- 1/2 Agedashi Tofu
- Yellow Tail Carpaccio
- Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe
- Juicy Deep Fried Chicken
- Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi
- Kobe Beef Liver
- Kurobuta Pork Cheek
- Pork Intestine 
- Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-based Sauce
- Asparagus with Bacon
- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon
- Cold Green Tea Soba with Poached Egg
- Grilled Rice Ball in Broth (both Salmon and Ume)
- Cheesecake

My favorites:
- Juicy Deep Friend Chicken
- Kurobuta Pork Cheek
- Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe
- Asparagus with Bacon
- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon
- Cold Green Tea Soba with Poached Egg
- Cheesecake

Items I could have done without:
- Yellow Tail Carpaccio
- Kobe Beef Liver
- Grilled Rice Balls

For 4 people, the total came out to only $48.50 per person, which is quite a deal considering all the food we ordered. All the servers were very attentive and were very informative on the food and how to eat certain dishes.

I LOVE tofu. 

To have a restaurant specializing in tofu shows you what kind of an establishment Raku is. They are above all else.

The housemade tofu is as creamy as the finest Italian Burratta, except this one is fat free. Silky and luxurious on the tongue, it's unforgettable. Add a bit of bonito flakes or finely chopped green onions for flavor. 

Every single dish we had was met with oooh and wow! From the yellowtail capaccio to the steamed foie gras custard. Standout items from their robata grill include: enoki, pork cheek and kobe beef skirt with garlic. What made me the happiest was, of course, the grilled foie gras with soy glazed sauce. I excitedly order 4 servings of foie gras right off the bat and our waitress says: ""you sure? how about two for now and maybe order again later?""  I respond with a: ""No, we'll finish it.

The awesome meal was complimented by two bottles of dry sake chosen by our waitress, the names of which I can't recall. (blame it on the booze?) All that food and drinks filled me up quick, so excuse me, I gotta go to the bathroom 

* 30 mins later * 

Badri: ""sure took you long enough to come back!"" 

Me: ""oh! I was playing with the buttons on the toilet seat. Then I accidentally set the stream to ""shower"" and I had to blow dry my tush and that took hella long time! Maybe I should suggest to the manager to install a speed dry?! ""

Badri: ""gee thanks, no appetite now!""  * drinks sake* 

Bf: ""how could you? So disgusting!""  * moves away from me * 

Rodney: ""Mmm! This tofu is gooood!!"" 

See? Tofu so good, even tales from the toilet won't keep you from eating it.

This place is so authentic and unique. I had never been to a Japanese Charcoal Grill restaurant before and this was a special experience. First off, I have to say the food is exceptional. We started off with a complimentary salad from the chef that bursted with flavor in our mouths. We then proceeded to have the Sashimi salad (delicious), the Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce (such tender and flavorful dark meat equaled to any filet mignon piece), following we had the Kurobuta Pork Belly with Spinach which was both flavorful and tender and finally we had their special of Tuna Collar or Kamatoro - this was one of the best ways that I have ever had tuna. The servers warned us that it would take a while to cook and it did (about 40 minutes) but it was worth the wait. I once saw an episode of Iron Chef where they cooked this part of the tuna and thought, ""Oh we'll never get a chance to eat something like that"" - well we were very wrong, delightfully wrong. The meat was cooked to perfection, not overdone; the crust on the outside was light, crispy and so flavorful we were amazed with each bite (seriously, this is no joke). This was one of the best meals I have ever had. We finished with the Green Tea Creme Brulee which was also so vibrant and rich, a green tea flavor that was unlike any other.

Pike Eel with plum sauce (on the specials) - probably the only disappointing thing we ordered.  it was okay.  great for the hot weather since it was cold but ehh

iberico pork - Magical!  a must order

kobe beef tendon - if you like tendon... order it!  grilled perfectly.  slightly crispy outside and really tender 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe - slimy, creamy.. delicious!

Service was great! Food was delicious but price was crazy! We had the omakase at $75/pp and the selections were not exactly as I had envisioned. 

1st Course - Tofu: I loved this tofu! It was so silky and melt in your mouth. Eat it with green tea sea salt first to experience the tofu flavor and then dip it in the toppings. 

2nd Course - Sashimi platter: Beautifully presented. The fish was delicious - melted in my mouth. But, I was actually more excited about the chrysanthemum palette cleanser that came with it .... lol. 

3rd Course - Grilled Cherry Tomato: So underwhelming because it was just grille tomato. Words cannot describe the disappointment. See picture I posted.

4th Course - Alaskan King Crab: Pretty good. Big chunks of meat but some legs where hard to crack. I enjoyed it with the seasonal citrus.

5th/6th Course - Beef Wagyu and Pork Cheek: The Beef Wagyu was SO GOOD. OMG. I could eat 10 sticks of these things. GET THIS! The pork cheek was meh. I didn't like it but my husband did. 

7th Course - Agedashi fish: Beautifully presented. Flavors were bomb. Loved it.

8th course - Inari: Lots of rice in case you weren't already full! LOL. The rice did have pickled veggies though. It wasn't anything special though imo.

9th course - Pomegranate Sorbet: Very tart. Very refreshing. I LOVED it. It wasn't over sweet or anything like that. It's supposed to be homemade

We were VERY full at the end of the night. It wasn't for the amount of food but for how slow we ate. I think it took about 2 hours for the entire meal.

OH, parking here is really bad. Everyone is aggressive in trying to snag a spot.

I think looking back I would've ordered a la carte. We chose omakase because it was our first time and we were overwhelmed on deciding what to order and the omakase allowed us to try different dishes with different cooking styles they are known for.

Raku is classier, less trendy and boisterous than the Vancouver izakaya's, but the food is solid.  

Of the hits, the foie gras with egg custard appetizer - the custard is the winner, subtly foie flavoured and so silky.  The foie gras on top was a bit tough with a layer of fat.  Made for a chewy mouthful instead of one that should have melted with the custard.

The deep-fried shrimp special were great - crackly, salty, fresh.  Eat the shell, eat the head - leave the eyeballs.  

Their home-made tofu is also a winner.  We tried it both ways, cold - served in a half moon, with green tea salt and agedashi hot fried - served in a nice broth and garnished with salmon roe.  

The kobe beef with wasabi skewer was nicely smokey and tender.  Not as much marbling as I would have liked.  

Their red snapper sashimi special was amazingly fresh.  I was impressed, I wasn't expecting to find that kind of quality here. 

Their green tea creme brulee is well-executed, served with green tea ice cream and whipped cream that I could have done without.  Their bubbly brown sugar pudding is interesting.  The bubbly part comes from frothed up milk?  It's quite bland, you need to eat it with the jelly-like brown sugar pudding.

This place would be great as a first-date night.  Service was first-rate, clearing dishes at almost every round of food.",N4_3LzKYZcLIBBjg2-0SAw,1,0,4,opJaUQ4cEXmao1DYaLXeOg

We came in around 7pm on a Saturday night and there were seats open abound... granted they were reserved for 8pm appointments. At first the hostess told us they couldn't seat us until 10pm but it was clearly not busy (yet). We ""pleaded"" and they agreed only on the condition we leave by 8pm. During our dinner, we saw many shocked walk-ins getting disappointed and turned away. 

The food was hit or miss. The menu options favored yakitori dishes. For just the two of us, we ordered quite a few dishes

1. Homemade tofu - two ways: cold and fried
2. Various yakitori: chicken thigh, pig's ear, bacon wrapped asparagus
3. 2x orders of cold soba (which came in an ""interesting"" sauce of poached egg and ponzu
4. Custard with foie gras 
5. Hotari Ika (tiny squid blanched in hot H2O and served cold

Total bill with tax/tip: $82

Raku has great ingenuity in their dishes; mixing uncommonly-paired items together. Problem is it may be too inventive and not right for some taste buds. However, there is no doubt that they use the best quality ingredients. Even their soy sauce, chili oil, and green tea salt are homemade.

Having a few days to digest the food and experience, I'm torn as to how many stars Raku deserves. A part of me wants to award it 5 stars for the quality and innovative dishes while another part wants denounce its lack of accommodation for walk-ins with a 1-star rating.

3461198,2009-02-04,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I've only done Las Vegas ""buffets"" on the strip... everyone always want to go to the usual big buffets - don't get me wrong, they are wonderful, and the planning of what combination of food best maximizes tastes & value is both an art and a science that i can appreciate...

this trip, however, was different... one of my good friends (she's an awesome event planner in Vegas) decided that it's about time I get a real taste of where the Foodies really eat in Las Vegas...

cue: Raku. it's located in an unassuming strip mall where random asian places are located.

it's a small little place, very cozy. one realizes you can't RUSH things here, the food, the ambiance... is chill, relax. Zen. things happen when they do.

we were in between a wave of tables, so my friend and i waited about 45 minutes for our table. Without reservations, on a saturday night, we couldn't complain...

This is a japanese fusion tapas place - the portions aren't huge, so you can order different things to try and get a taste, and always order more...

---------------------------------------------------

always asks for today's specials... they have all the specials listed on a chalkboard and the cute japanese waitresses patiently explain what each one is. we ordered my friend's favorites (a Foodie trusts another Foodie after all) and i was famished...

what is this??? the chef sent over a grilled ground chicken skewer on the house! they felt bad we had to wait so long for a table, this started off the night just right. TENDER, JUICY ground chicken, full of flavor but silky smooth, grilled on a skewer and glazed gently with a sweet, sticky sauce lightly. Wow, i hadn't thought ground anything can taste like this.

the next item is tuna belly minced up mixed with flavor oils and minced green onion. the fish is so fresh, it does not even remind me of FISH... it tastes of refreshing OCEAN, and i can feel the breeze...

we had the sea urchin on soup... i like sea urchin but it is an aquire taste, and it's floating gently on the soup makes one appreciate the delicate urchin and the gentleness of the warm soup that cradles the urchin taste.

we tried the grilled pork cheeks skewers (get a skewer per person, this is so tasty!) - it tastes like bite size bacon bits with chunks of meat.

we also had the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms... how can anything bacon wrap go wrong, really?

next up is the Slippery Dish... at least my friend calls it that. a light broth acts as the canvas, floating on top is little mushroom, thinly sliced okra, salmon roes, sliced japanese radish of some kind, poached egg and sea urchin. Everything on this dish is a bit 'slimey' in texture, but all different. it's a complex layering of texture that plays well with each other. (on the other hand, if you hate slimey food, you might not want to get this one)

then came the favorites of the night...

foie gras savory steam egg custard - with a light sauce on top and a piece of duck graces the top of this. the steamed egg custard was silky smooth, and the richness of foie gras... I had never imagined foie gras can complement the egg so well!!!!!!

grilled foie gras... a generous portion (for tapas) seared on a grill (smokey flavor!) and gently glazed with a miso-sweet sauce...


If you are still reading - we were 2 girls who had ALL THIS FOOD. at this point we were done... so full. can't move.

but dessert calls, and my friend has never tried dessert here.

we decided to finish the meal off with some 'light dessert' (hahahah light. right). so we ordered the seasonal sorbet, which turned out to be Asian Pear Sorbet.
Wow. it was sweet, juicy, refreshing... the best of an asian pear. it's as if they took the asian pear and froze it and then grind it up into granita... they also drizzled some light condensed milk-cream into the sorbet halfway down the cup. SOOO good. a perfect way to finish off a 5 star meal.

i LOVE Raku. it's unique, it's interesting. Every single plate, from appertizer skewers to dessert, had THOUGHT behind it. it's like when you hear music that makes you move with it. when you sit in front of a sunset and life just makes sense. every dish conveyed a message.

life is way too short to not try this place when you're in town. Raku's food touched my soul....

They utilize White Oak Binchotan which is often seen at Yakitori and infuses a montage of mind-blowing flavors into all food blessed with its powerful essence. Decore is dark, yet sinfully exquisite, remnants of cute Japanese antiquary. Lively and booming ambiance. Overall clean, including back areas. The restroom door is a portal to an authentic Japanese restroom, technological advances, fish tank built-into the wall, you may drift away to slumberland...

Decent Beer & Wine list, including a few Japanese Crafts. GRAND sake selection, super cereal... around 60! Abstained from boozing due to an exhilarating conference, but next rendezvous! Food is fresh and high in quality. Their special sauces are unique, the Koregusu is divine.

Omakase, $100
...Raku's Tofu 1/2 (Homemade), $3.5: Market tofu is an abomination.
...Tofu Skin: Interesting texture, slimey, yet satisfying.
...Sashimi: Akami w/ Black Seaweed is mind-blowing, Hamachi, Ocean Trout, super fresh.
...Kobe Beef Sashimi: Wagyu in its purest form, a hint of a mesquite soy glaze w/ the grated wasabi is the purr-fect compliment to cut the rich-fattiness.
...Crispy Rice Asparagus Okaki, $5: Crispy and refreshing, light salt.
...Enoki Mushroom w/ Bacon, $3: Mesquite bacon flavor, probably grilled over binchotan, complimented by the enoki texture, and ponzu. F'n delicious! OMFG!
...Grilled Sanma: Err... tiny bones, but fishy goodness with the texture of the grilled skin really takes you back to the good ol' days, or were they?.
...Iberico Pork, $10: Rich and very fatty, a real heart-attack.
...Lamb Chop w/ Apple-Ponzu, $6: Finger-lickin' good.
...Foie Gras Don, $18.5: Finely chopped greens is the purr-fect compliment to the richness of Foie Gras, rich, moist, and full of flavor, generous portion.
...Hot Oolong Tea: Comforting, soothing.
...Fluffy Cheesecake (Homemade), $6: Truly fluff-ay, lighter than your average cheesecake, try Raku Sweets!

Honesty disappointed with the Chef's choices, esp when you see photos of other patrons' Omakase. Let's be generous and say the Tofu Skin, 6-pc Sashimi, Kobe, and Sanma is all together $50, that's $102... would've been better off a-la-carte, that's bad... plus any attempts to ask the Chef a Q is futile, he will ignore you. Fortunately the fish is fresh and the fresh fish display at the Sushi Bar is cool, and that's good! Will try their Kaiseki next rendezvous, hoping for a better line-up.

Service is OK, it was not busy. The other Sushi Chef Kazu-san was friendly. Server Andrew is knowledgeable in Raku's cuisine and describes each dish to purr-fection. Seems the staff interaction is full of laughs, esp the BOH, camaraderie is key, patrons feel the good vibes. The staff seems to somewhat grasp the concept of ""Sense of Urgency"".

WARNING! Recommend reservations. No language barrier with the servers, but the Chefs speak minimal English.

Overall piquant flavors of fresh ingredients in an exciting atmosphere. Off-strip, but an authentic Japanese Charcoal Grill House experience worth the venture.
$100 Bill + $9.5 Bloody Taxes + $20 Tip = $138.45.

Two items in the surprisingly f'n good category were:
- The fried and cold tofu.  Who could imagine, especially with cold tofu, that something could be so flavorful?  (Who could imagine that I'd even eat tofu when the meat menu was so lengthy?)
- The Kobe beef tendon.  Our server warned that it's ""slimy.""  It's not what I'd anticipated, after having tendon in pho and tweaking various tendons in my body.  Consistency of butter, and an incredibly rich bordering-on-foie-gras flavor... wow!

Like most folks I highly recommend home made tofu in hot broth. My personal favorite is sashimi salad.  Other great items include sweet corn with stuffed potato, bacon wrapped asparagus, kobe beef with wasabi, and chicken skewers wrapped in skin.  Custard with fois gras was awesome.  The prices are reasonable and portions are small.  

We had a couple of special entrees but I was not impressed.  We had grilled eel from Japan cooked two different ways (sweet sauce/salt and pepper). The dish was good but not great.  If it was $15-16 range I'd say it's worth it. It's not worth $30. I didn't like pigs ears either.  Perhaps its an acquired taste.  

Oden was good but nothing special. Also try his soy sauce.  It's home made by the chef. It's the bomb!

I also recommend sake samplers but unfortunately they decide which ones.  They tell you ahead of time so you can decide whether to go for it or not.  It usually include one or two from their regular section plus one from their premium section.   If you know what you want, then go with your personal favorite.

The portion sizes were smaller, but just enough for you to try a good variety of items. We also ordered some of the items off the special menu: baby Japanese conch [which was too bland] and homemade fresh tofu. The tofu had a nice texture to it, I would recommend getting it half fried and normal so you get to taste both textures. If you are a fan of uni [sea urchin], I would recommend getting the sea urchin seaweed soup. The uni was extremely fresh and the soup was light enough to not mask the sweetness of the uni.

So our group walked in at 12:30 AM on Sunday without booking and we had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. There was a 2 hours dining limit. 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) - Definitely not a dish everyone can accept because of the sea urchin's unique taste, but personally I thought the dish had an interesting texture (gooey and slimy) and a very subtle taste (a bit sweet and a bit salty). Overall, a very neat dish.

Enoki Mushroom w/ Bacon ($3 each) - *munch munch munch* chewy and flavorful AND it smelled delicious.  

Kurobuta Pork Cheek ($4.25 each) - Best order of the night. So chewy, so tender, so juicy, and so mind-blowingly good. 

Agedashi tofu (half, $7.5) - Not my favorite dish, but it wasn't too bad. Slightly fried homemade tofu with dashi broth = very refreshing taste.

Apple Marinated Colorado Lamb Chop ($16) - My goodness, this gotta be the single BIGGEST lamb chop I've ever seen. Probably the 2nd best lamb chop I've had and one of the most succulent and smoky lamb chop ever. 

Kobe Beef Tendon ($3.5 each) - Crispy tendon with rich and fatty taste. I personally liked cheek a bit better, but tendon was really good too. 

Definitely one of the best izakaya I've tried so far. This place is definitely a bit more expensive than your typical izakaya places, but you are essentially paying for quality and not quantity. If some people are willing to spend $50 for Vegas buffets, then I don't see why price would be an issue here.

 Cooked yellowtail, cooked liver, liver sashimi, and duck was pretty good. Didn't really enjoy the foi gras custard surprisingly... Considering how many people recommended it. We thought the foi gras skewers were much much better. The pig ear and intestine were too chewy for us but we aren't used to eating those cuts.

Went here for a girls' night and was warned that we would forfeit our reservation if we were 15 mins late. I knew they meant business. Once I walked in, I understood why they were so strict about reservations. The restaurant is small and unassuming. Most people would never notice it since it's in the corner of a small shopping center in Chinatown.

I can't even remember the names of most of the food that I tried but I assure you that everything was SUPERB. I am not a fan of tofu at all but the agedashi tofu is to die for. The yummy miso soup was the best miso soup I've ever had. The servings are definitely small and meant for 1-2 people at most but you can just taste the quality in every dish. 

The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service was extremely slow. I am usually a patient person and rarely complain to servers but I had to check on my orders twice because it was almost an hour and my food hasn't arrived yet. 

Raku is definitely 5 star dining that is more affordable than most Strip restaurants. Reservations are highly recommended and set aside at least 2-3 hours for your meal.",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,3,1,4,P9uwoCwCEztg6bQPizb1mA

Located in the same plaza as big Wong, mints ramen, Kung fu tea.. super popular plaza so hope for parking lot luck otherwise be careful since surrounding streets have plentiful no parking signs. 

The service was super helpful and friendly and we ended up ordering a variety of dishes to split. Our order organized by awesomeness included:
- poached egg with uni - slimy, salty, with a little crunch from diced potatoes, fish roe, and okra.. loved the textures, flavors, uniqueness
- yellowtail sashimi with spicy sauce - yellowtail was super fresh and buttery
- whole order of tofu - house made soft tofu that was lightly ?fried so there's an outer slightly crispy/chewy crunch, sitting in a delicious broth with mushrooms, salmon roe, green onions, seaweed

Also ordered the waygu beef sashimi, which was on special and we've been wanting to try. Hard to find and was real fresh, great with the house made soy sauce and broth and probably great for what it is but not really my cup of tea since a little chewy, heavy (although this is a taste preference and not knock on the chef or presentation). We also tried the enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon and deep tied asparagus, both which were done amazingly well but I didn't find them as must have again exciting at the tofu, yellowtail, or poached egg. Of note the chef's special seems really popular and the guy next to us seemed to enjoy it so check that option out too (included dessert, tea, large selection of items)

We also tried the 3 sake sampler, which was server selected. They have a huge selection and I liked how he asked us about our preferences to select ones we would best enjoy.. also provided a detailed description of them.. nice deal at $20

This was one of my favorite meals in Sin City and it was off the strip, tucked in a mini-mall. I was surprised at how hot this restaurant was on Yelp because it was tiny and unpretentious... unlike the rest of LV. We had the: 

- Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe
- Fried Homemade Tofu in Hot Broth
- Kobe Beef Fillet with Wasabi
- Kurobuta Pork Cheek
- Foie Gras
- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon
- Cold Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Custard Soup
- Fluffy Cheesecake

Everything was small but incredibly flavorful. All the meats danced and melted on my tongue. You know a restaurant is a winner when it can charge $10 for tofu and I can leave without bitching, whining, or crying. The only item that I wouldn't order again is the cheesecake, but then again--I should've known better than to get that at a charcoal grill.

3591817,2015-01-08,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"What can I honestly say about Raku that probably hasn't already been said? The food was elegant and well executed, though some of the dishes had less than outstanding flavor overall. The service was pleasant, though the pacing on that night was difficult. We couldn't get a reservation that night, but we showed up at opening and got seated at the bar - really not a bad deal because you do get to watch the chefs in motion.

While I sampled many dishes, these were my main hits and misses...

By and far the most unique and pleasant flavor of the evening was the Udon Noodle with Foie Gras Egg Custard Soup - Extremely rich and flavorful with a unique style to it. Thin cold udon noodles weren't exactly my favorite idea - I actually felt like a warm noodle soup would be fine. But still, there was an amazing depth of flavor with this dish, and a unique presentation on top of it.

The Hamachi Kama was a huge piece of fish collar with a ton of flavor and was very tender. This was also a great value being priced under 20 dollars for the amount of fish on the actual plate.

The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi was something I really tried on a whim - really kind of unique in that it has a slimy but incredibly smooth texture, I wasn't sure I loved the flavor but the special salt they had at the table side really helped enhance what was already there. It was unique, but I doubt I'd try it again.

While the Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic was really good, I didn't really enjoy the fillet with wasabi - it was too lean and the wasabi overwhelmed the flavor. The Tsukune-Grilled Ground Chicken was a bit of a disappointment as well - I've had similar at Kyara and it was no better nor any different. The duck and lamb were each average to me - the duck had a good texture, but I didn't care for the presentation or the overall flavor. The lamb was marinated which really covers up the flavor of the lamb and because it was an apple marinade, it came out rather sweet.

One of the highlights of the evening was the dessert - a fluffy cheese cake which had a texture closer to a cloud rather than the heavy cheese cake that is typical. The sweetness was muted as well, but it was still absolutely delicious.

Unfortunately I felt that the service was a little less than stellar because the pacing of the dishes was rather iffy. After the appetizers, we waited about 20 minutes for the Hamachi Kama, and then suddenly all the grilled items were coming out faster than we could eat.

Still, I had some very memorable bites of food here that I will think back upon for a while. It was pricey, but definitely not astronomical by any means.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,2,4,f8Wz5kVQMzLSKIx3isD4kQ

I'm by no means a Las Vegas local, but I definitely consider this place as another one of those little hidden Japanese gems that people normally don't come to when they're in Vegas..

Having been to Vegas multiple times this year, I'm a little tired of the usual hotel buffets (even the good ones). My bf & I decided to look for something not on the strip, but because it was night time, not many restaurants were open. We found Raku after looking for a place that'd be open past midnight (they're open til 3am daily), since we weren't sure what time we'd be out of the hotel.

It's located in a small plaza, and I would even go as far as to say it's a bit seedy looking. I didn't feel comfortable parking there, since I'm not from the area and it was somewhat deserted and very dark.. Park I did though, and once I stepped into the restaurant I quickly forgot my worries. My bf & I looked over the menu and to our delight everything sounded delicious to our hungry stomachs.

We ordered the following:
Bluefin tuna (A special for the day, absolutely delicious. My bf's quote while eating this: ""I almost thought I was eating steak for a second"")
Eggplant (Definitely tasted the sweetness of the eggplant)
Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic (2 orders) (Delicious, the garlic slices on top was perfect for the beef)
Oden with beef tendon, potato, & egg (Wasn't a fan of the tendon, but the soup the food was in was light and tasty)
Potato with corn (2 orders) (I am amazed at how they fit a piece of potato perfectly into the middle of corn slices; it was delicious!)
Kurobuta pork cheek (Lots of fat, which I liked)
Lamb chop (I'm normally not a fan of lamb chops so I can't say much about this)
Kobe beef tendon (2 orders) (Yummy! Melts in your mouth)
Chicken thigh (Delicious like everything else)
Butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce (Looked better than it tasted IMO, but still pretty good)
Grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce (The balsamic soy sauce added a light tangy flavor to the dish)
Green tea creme brulee (Came with green tea ice cream on top)

3604343,2013-02-12,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"We did the 15 course kaiseki with premium sake and water pairings.
Mind-Blowing doesn't even encompass the greatness of this meal. I'd put this in the top 5 meals of my life. The kaiseki is seasonal and changes, so I won't bother going into all the details... and my pictures were dim and blurry due to lighting, so I'm a bit embarrassed. The service was wonderful. We were seated in a small private room with a paper screen door. Two servers served us and seemed available at a moments notice any time. The pairings were phenomenal, but I will say opting for as much sake as we did was probably a bit excessive. Another note: unless you really are capable of doing the 15 courses you need to be prepared to either not eat all of some of the latter courses, or have an immense appetite. I consider myself someone who has a pretty big appetite (I've been known to do multiple tasting dinners in one night and then go for late night snacks afterwords), but this was just... too much. When I go back I'll probably either opt for the 10 course, or pace myself and remember I can't possibly finish everything. The last several meat courses were basically about 1/2 the size of full sized entrees. I would also ask to skip the hot sake pairing as that I simply do not enjoy hot sake, period. The owner came and met us and talked for a while, out server translated, and he was so happy and friendly he walked us to the cab and bowed to us as we drove away. Fantastic experience. I believe pairings were equal to the cost of the meal per person, so it ended up around $300/pp ++. Well worth it.

Highlights: ""Kobe"" beef cooked on a stone and flambéed with cognac, foie gras custard, beef tendon, agadashi tofu (perhaps the 2nd best dish), yuba (tofu skin) with uni in ponzu (IMO the best dish of the night), cold house tofu.

You could also go and just do ala carte izakaya style grilled meats and be sublimely happy. The binchotan charcoal and charred meats on skewers is also a wonderful experience.

Had the staples that everyone seem to order. Had the Wagu beef with wasabi, wish it was Japanese wagu and not American which would tasted so much better but still good. Also had the duck, pork and mushroom skewers, all were great. give it 5 stars for that.

sat at the counter so i was watching the person who does the shashimi and the salad and he wasa pro, always making it look awesome. 

the waitress were nice and very cute so that made it a great atmosphere add they help you figure or the order and really are helpful.

Food is expensive, so come with a deep pocket as 5 dish can add up. Spent over $40 on my simple dish but i didn't mind add i was on vacation.

Located in a small tiny corner in Chinatown. We got there about 10 minutes before our reservation time, but we were assisted to sit down right away. The food itself takes quite a long time to arrive. We were there for almost 2 hours. It took about a good 45 minutes for the first plate to come out. 

I actually prefer Shin Sen Gumi Yakitori over this place. The taste isn't as strong as theirs. But, overall it's pretty good. 

Popeye salad $8- Spinach and bacon (mainly), decently good. A little too salty, but a good salad nonetheless!

Asparagus Okaki $5- DELICIOUS. Super crunchy, and it actually tasty cheesy! Nom nom. 

Juicy Fried Chicken $9- Not a favorite. Didn't have too much flavor to it, and it was strangely chewy. Slightly warm as well. 

Ice Fish $8.50- Frowning as I write this. I don't like fish, and I don't like seeing multiple tiny fishes fried up whole. I ate like 3.. D: no gusta.

Agedashi Tofu $11- Pretty good! I just didn't like the fish eggs inside, but overall it was a good and flavored dish!

Momo chicken thigh $2.75 each- Err, it was a little too pink for my liking, and it was kind of fatty. It was okay 

Tsukune $3.50 each- Shin Sen's is much tastier. This one comes as like a drumstick, and I had to keep adding more togarashi. Not enough sauce. 

Harami Kobe Beef skirt $7.50 each- Delicious! Comes with grunchy garlic chips. Mmm, super tasty!

Yakionigiri $5.00 (comes with 2)- It was..okay. Lol

Scallop with soy sauce $7.00- Not sure how this tasted. Didn't eat this one!

Asparagus with Bacon $3.00- Comes with 3 pieces, pretty good. 

Asahi $7.00

Umeshu $12.00 (super delicious!)

For me, I think the portion size is great because we were able to try the different types of dishes they have. Taste was really good, but eventually it got tiring to eat.

3681319,2016-08-18,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku far exceeded my expectations and has definitely been added to my list of favorite restaurants out in Vegas area!

My friend Christina T. had recommended Raku for years because she had known that I frequented Vegas quite often.  Unfortunately, Raku is off the strip so not super convenient if you do not have transportation but not too far off depending on where you are staying.  Sure, the place may not match the glitz and the glamor of places on the strip, Raku definitely hides some great foodie gems.

I would highly recommend getting reservations if you want to make sure you get a seat.  I had tried to make reservations about a week before but was told that the only available seats were at 10:30!  To make sure my friend and I could get seats we went to wait for the restaurant to open thirty minutes before opening.  When we first arrived, there was just one group ahead but soon after there was a growing line of people.  

Instead of poring over the menu, my friend and I ordered the premium omakase which ended up being eleven plates chosen to be the best sampling of what the restaurant had to offer.  If you have the money to spare and hungry, I would highly recommend this!

HIGHLIGHTS:
Raku's tofu - silky smooth fresh tofu with few embellishments to lightly flavor

Butter Sautéed scallop - I rarely like scallop but this was soooooo good!  The natural butteriness of the scallop cooked to a nice consistency

Fried whole fish in dashi - A nice sized fish fried and nestled in a warm soy sauce broth

Kobe beef filet skewer with wasabi - A meaty beef skewer that has the signature fattiness of Kobe beef matches well with heat from wasabi

Green tea creme brûlée - by far, one of my favorite desserts I have had in a long time!  I am a fan of green tea and the execution as a creme brûlée was superb.  I just wished I could continue scooping this forever.

MEH:
Foie gras don - Overhyped for me because it was laid thick with a sweet syrupy sauce.  There was a good amount of foie but I couldn't get past that sauce.  Nice concept though.

Parking can be a little difficult to find in this very packed plaza!  Luckily found a parking spot but you may have to find parking elsewhere and walk over.  Service was pretty spot on.

Raku is genius because everything on the menu is pretty cheap (we're talking around $4 for most dishes) and the delicious dishes are small, so you can try a bunch of things, get pretty full, and still leave with money in your pocket.

3735405,2013-07-03,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"As mentioned in other reviews on Yelp, the food here is fairly remarkable. Raku has been shortlisted for the James Beard award, as has its chef, Mitsuo Endo, and it's easy to see why. The food is boldly flavored, without losing any of the subtlety that makes Japanese cuisine so appealing.

There are two reasons I'd look to diminish Raku's rating:

1. The wait for our food was rather insane. Right after we ordered, some bowls and spoons were brought out to the table, which then proceeded to sit there unused for over a half hour until our first dish arrived. Granted, the waitress explained that the kitchen was in a bit of a jam that night, but while the restaurant was lively at the time of our reservation (11:30 PM), it was certainly not packed. It's definitely possible that they were short-staffed.

2. Most, but not all of the food was great. The Kobe beef in particularly was unremarkable and made me wonder whether Raku was party to the recent American trend of taking beef from quarter-Wagyu breeds and naming it Kobe. The meat had none of the richness and marbling that one would expect from Kobe beef. This may stem from the fact that the cuts offered were skirt and filet, which are definitely not known for their marbling to begin with, but when the word Kobe is attached the meat, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the feature that's most heavily associated with it.

Those problems aside, Raku was still a fantastic experience, and could be a solid five stars on the strength of other items on the menu that I did not get the chance to try. Even despite the problems above, I think Raku is far better than most of the other restaurants I've consistently found rated at four stars on Yelp, but it fell a bit short compared to some of the other meals we had in Vegas. That being said, the food was still wonderful, and there were numerous highlights that I'd recommend:

Recommendations:

1. Agedashi Tofu - The tofu itself was fresh and delicious, but the broth was mindblowing. Packed with flavor and umami, our entire table agreed that it was one of the best things we'd tasted in Vegas up to that point.

2. Iberico Pork - The Iberico Pork skewer was miles better than the Kobe Beef skewers. The pork was incredibly juicy with just the right amount of fat, and the marinade hit all of the right flavor notes. I would've been happy just eating a few skewers over rice with sauce dribbled on top. This is up there with the best pork I've ever had.

3. Chicken Teba Wing - A relatively large portion of chicken wing for the price, it came perfectly salted, and had just the right amount of char. The kicker was the ridiculous juiciness of the chicken - it's hard to imagine a chicken wing being cooked better than this.

Avoid:

1. Foie Gras Custard - The other foie gras dishes were unavailable that night, so we decided to try the foie gras custard. While I wouldn't say that it was bad, it was missing pretty much any note of foie gras. The custard was suitably creamy, but overall, the dish was nothing special.

2. Kobe Beef Skewers - Not offensively bad, but nothing special. See above for comments.

Overall, the strength of Raku's best dishes makes it a five-star restaurant for me. The decor was charming (especially the small pieces of binchotan that we used as chopstick holders). Honestly, if Yelp would allow me to rate it a 4.5, it'd probably get that, but I'll err on the generous side for this rating. Not as good as Kabuto next door (albeit an entirely different type of food), but some of the dishes are right up there with the best small plate food I've ever had.",cEgqvdaoobEkEj0VhYSUMg,6,6,5,l0pRgxn4aHFheb59yk4ZJQ

3756781,2015-05-07,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"so glad i got to try this place!

what i ate:
- raku's tofu: honestly, this was my favorite dish of the night. it was so simple, but soooo tasty, especially when paired with the various condiments found on the table - the aged soy sauce, the sea salt, etc. the tofu was so fresh. the texture was like a firm custard or a panna cotta. i wanted to order another one just for myself. 
- poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe: so, i loved this dish soooo much, but it wasnt perfect for me. i mean, i love everything in this dish. even the mountain yam, with it's ooey gooey texture was nice in this dish. but for me, this would have been perfect over a nice bowl of fresh white rice, with just a drizzle of the aged soy sauce. THAT would have been my perfect dish. it was still great to eat though. it was ooey from the mountain yam (if you havent had it before it has that slimy texture, similar to okra, but it crunchy like an apple), the bursts of sea salt freshness from the uni, the salty umami pops from the salmon roe, the creaminess from the poached egg. it was really delicious, but i would love this over a bowl of white rice. 
- steamed foie gras egg custard: this was probably the other contender for my favorite dish of the night. the egg custard was sooooo ... omg, let me wipe the drool from my face. it was so creamy and silken and salty and full of umami flavor from the foie gras. the little piece of foie on the top was tender. it came in a tiny little bowl, and i wanted more, so much more. 
- (special) grilled langostine: YES. this was tasty. sweet and tender, and a bit smokey from the grill. 
- kobe beef filet w/wasabi: i loved the fresh wasabi. it complimented the tender beef so well
- kobe beef outside skirt w/garlic: do you love garlic? do you love beef? then you should get this skewer. the fried garlic was a tasty little garlic chip, the beef tender
- kobe beef liver: i was not a fan, but i'm not a fan of liver in general. i'm not that cultured i suppose. it was just a bit too gritty and irony for me, but my two dining buddies loved it. more for them!
- butter sauteed sea scallop with soy sauce: this was absolutely decadent! the scallop was perfectly cooked, but it was the soy sauce butter that made this sooo tasty. it was almost too salty, but i didnt care. wanted to eat them all 
- mushroom w/bacon: cooked to perfection

pros:
- food: i really wanted to try everything on this menu! i definitely want to come back and get the omakase tasting menu
- service was spot on, typical of a japanese restaurant
- quality of the food was exquisite
- decor: i really liked how this place was decorated. it was dark and intimate, the tables were of wood. it was nice. 

cons:
- small. tiny. seriously, very small restaurant. two small dining rooms, one counter where you could sit in front of the cooks. this isnt the place to bring your six other friends. best to bring a date or just a few other friends
- reservations are hard to come by. actually, no it wasnt hard, but when we made reservations a month in advance, the first time that was available was 1030 at night. i found it amusing that a family was there around that same time asking for a table, and being turned away, next the next available seating time was at 130am. so my advice MAKE A REZ! 
- pricey. yes. but... not pricey. admittedly this was our second dinner of the night (fatty status oink oink!), but i thought for the quality of the food we got, and the thoughtfulness in which the food was prepared, the price point was just right. though i've never had it, i would think that the omakase tasting menu would be the best bang for your buck!

would i come again? YES! already planning my next meal here",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,2,0,4,NSsCxFaieHLJU4VLce1_pg

The environment was very comfortable, the setting and everything was embellished with Japanese features. the hosts, servers were all Japanese, not to say they aren't diversifying, but it added an extra je ne sais quoi... feeling of authenticity . Everything about the place, you can tell served a purpose, from charcoal holding the chopsticks to cups containing salt at the entrance.. the aesthetic value of the place was a 10 out of a 10. they even served water with a piece of charcoal (i guess  japanese do that to absorb the flavour).  onto the food: 

agedashi tofu was crispy on the outside, sprinkled with seaweed, homemade broth, mushrooms and fish roe. the hot sauce complimented the dish.
Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin
very tender, served like a sushi roll.. 
Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic
this was REAAALYY GOOD!!.. tender beef the crunchy garlic did not overpower the beef
Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon
the sauce complimented the mushrooms and tasted like eating scallops
Fried whole smelt fish
this was explained by the server as imported from japan, and fried whole, complimented with spicy peppers..
Salmon fried rice.
it was not fishy, but tasted really lean.. and flavorful. the fish roe pops in your mouth.. 
additionally we ordered fried baby crab, so the server brought out a live one for us to see.

Our experience here was marred by a lousy service experience.  Reservations are necessary and not easy to make on short notice.  We arrived for our reservation on time.  When we sat down we were warned we had only had 1 1/2 hours to eat.  We would have been fine, but they are very slow to bring out our dishes.  We were told we should order all our food p front and would not have time to add more.  Desert was discouraged.  This was exacerbated by the fact that the room they sat us in was still empty when we left.  When you pay near $100 per person, you expect better treatment.  I suspect that their success has led to a ""soup nazi"" like mentality.

The house made tofu is excellent.  We also had a rare pork dish that was not very good.  The grilled vegetables are no better than cheaper restaurants like Kyara.  The European fusion dishes like the foie gras tofu are interesting and worth a try.

Overall, worth trying due to its uniqueness.  It is quite expensive and difficult to get in so you will need to decide for yourself if it is worth it",DuMWyxL4DMcy5A8MXD_67w,6,0,3,8r-AjOdqXyr6qe2mxxuuzg
3877286,2017-03-07,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Abriya Raku is routinely lauded as one of the best dining experiences in Las Vegas. It came highly recommended by several friends in addition to the thousands of online reviews. I finally got to try this place last week for my girlfriend's birthday. Early dinner hour reservations are hard to come by, but we were able to snag one for 9:00 pm. If you're okay with eating later, they are open until 3:00 am. Compared to the other restaurants in this plaza, the setting is fancier. We were quickly seated in an intimate private table in the back. 

The menu is broken down by food preparations. We started off we the lighter and cold dishes, which quickly progressed to more robust flavors from the grill. I will break it down by types of courses.

Cold dish: The yellowtail carpaccio was our first dish and delicately prepared. One of my favorites of the evening was the poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe. This seafood medley had such clean flavors and well executed. My favorite dish of the night was the blue fin tuna. This was $35 for 9 pieces of sashimi (5 pieces of tuna and 4 pieces of tuna closer to the belly, but not quite toro), which was well worth the price. This tuna sashimi was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. I later learned that it is aged 6-7 days in the fridge to allow for the fat to break down appropriately. It is perfect as is, but also delicious when served with a dab of fresh wasabi and seaweed. 

Robata grill: Favorites from the grill included the enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon and the butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce. I wasn't as big of a fan of the yellowtail, which I thought was a bit dry or the duck with balsamic soy sauce. The kurobuta pork cheek was a nice fatty treat. The chicken breast wrapped in chicken skin could have used more flavor, but I did enjoy the crispy skin. 

Tofu: Raku is known for their homemade tofu and I was a bit disappointed by the agedashi as it was mostly completely soggy in the sauce. However, the sauce was incredibly flavorful and soul-warming. We ended up adding on the pork belly, which was a good end to the main courses.

Dessert: I loved the fluffy cheesecake which ended our meal. It was light, airy, and everything I would want from a cheesecake. 

Overall, the meal was excellent. I wouldn't say I was a fan of everything (mostly related to the grill), but the experience was great and the service was excellent. In addition to the food, they have homemade chili oil (soaked in sake), soy sauce, and seasoning at table side. The bathroom was also quite interesting with the bidet facing a live aquarium whilst ambient sounds of dripping water play overhead. I would definitely recommend trying the a la carte menu and picking out some of my favorites as opposed to the omakase, which is based on many of the same menu items, but chef's choice. The $100 includes some premium items compared to the more basic $75 option.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,5,3,4,bIGy7ae2U4G3T7WUFHqPdg

My mom and I called the day of and was able to get a reservation at 11pm. If you're looking for combination dinners, this ain't your place. Raku values good quality dishes, fresh and seasonal dishes, and making memories. It's definitely a one of a kind restaurant where you get to try foie gras chawanmushi(egg custard) or a homemade agedashi tofu. The list goes on. 

Since it was late, we ordered Zaru Tofu, Agedashi tofu, Kurobuta Pork Cheek Yakitori, Foie Gras Egg Custard, Wagyu Ishi Yaki, and Green Tea Creme Brûlée (highly recommend!). A little pricey but you get what you pay for. Also, service was excellent! They explained how to eat the Zaru Tofu, which was helpful since every restaurant has a different way of preparing it. Our tea was also never empty, good way of knowing how much to tip.

We were fortunate enough to get same day reservations...  what are reservations? Wierd I know but totally worth planing ahead to dine here.  Everything we had was absolutely on point and so delicious. A must for date night, business dinner or visiting from out of town, venture off the strip and try this place out, a total Gem!

 Oh yeah the best part, The Food! So we ate like we do everywhere else, like it's our last meal, and like we haven't ate in months, we try to order it all anywhere we go so we did... Some of what I remember that we ordered and all was amazing was, The infamous house made Tofu.. Just melts in your mouth, the Ken2 Salad, it's fucking salad but it's good, however, what we found here with one dish was the answer for world peace, The Poached egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe...  Moment of silence for that dish, feed that to the rest of the world and all will be fine! From the Robata Grill we had quite a bit, The New Zealand Apple marinated Lamb Chops, amazing so good, then came out Le Fois Gras, oh my Jesus, should have had like 6 orders, The Kobe Beef fillet with Wasabi good but I enjoyed the lamb more, The Duck with balsamic soy sauce, she loved da duck, and the rest was a mix of the veggie skewers (egg plant, asparagus ets) gotta get yo greens in too!

This place is off the beaten path and our taxi driver had no idea where it was. FYI if you go and you get a taxi tell them it's in Chinatown. You would never guess this restaurant gem is located in a no frills strip mall. 

The flavors you find are simple and so inventive. In my ignorance I thought Sushi = Japanese. Not so! This style of Japanese cuisine uses a charcoal cooking method. It was incredible!!!! 

They have gianormous pitchers of Sapporo for $24... take advantage of that... we sure did... two times *HICK*. 

Now the food... wow! This was one of the best meals I've had in a good long while. Every dish was a surprise, there were no culinary clichés. As insignificant as this may sound the green tea salt is amazing. I am typically not a salt lover, but i kept reaching for the salt. They make homemade tofu fresh daily (WOW). Do try the Foie Gras, which is kissed on the charcoal grill. A subtle hint of smoke accompanies this and even our vegetarian had to give this a try. The chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin is eyes rolling in the back of your head good. So juicy, so flavorful, sooooo good!! But the real winner was the spiny lobster. TO DIE FOR!!! The natural sweetness of the lobster on the grill was incredible. When we'd almost finished our server came by to see if we would like them to use the remainder of the lobster to make a miso soup. We giggled with delight. 

This place is excellent on so many levels. It's still a hidden gem (for now). Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed!!!",DEdfTR0qpeVylrqxog80TA,3,0,5,R02T-wXXOpcJBgwZ1vcwqg

-kobe beef with wasabi: very tender and well cooked.
-mushroom wrapped in bacon: no seasoning on the mushroom and the bacon could have been cooked a little more.  very disappointing dish.
-crispy tofu in broth:  truth be told, I don't like the texture of tofu and this dish did not change my mind.
-chicken and egg rice:  too slimy a dish for me and the flavors didn't really stand out.
-pork belly with mustard sauce: very well cooked.  melted in your mouth but I would have preferred a little crispiness on the outside of the belly.  still, a very nice dish.

There are too many delicious dishes, but here are some of the highlights that I do remember:

Tofu: housemade tofu with greentea salt or house soysauce. This was smooth, unique, and the soy flavor really comes through.

Sashimi platter: they had a really nice selection, including uni, and all the fish were extremely fresh. They had a salted seaweed that they recommended to eat with the tuna, which made for a great flavor! 

Oyster shooters: These were delicate, briny and topped with some caviar. Tasty.

Salmon roe rice: This was a great way to end the meal, though I was already pretty full by this point. We had plenty left over, and they helped us make it into rice balls to take away. Made for a great late night snack later!

But I wish for management to take this as an opportunity to improve rather than criticism. I made reservations a month in advance like many had recommended on here. I was really looking forward to this experience and studied the menu extensively before coming here. 

We ordered an assortment of skewers and raw dishes. Upon my first bite, into the enoki wrapped in bacon, I knew exactly how the rest of the meal was going to turn out. There was an overwhelming taste of butane - that nauseating and intrusive taste. Now I know french chefs use these to finish off their creme brulees, and pop-up ""sushi"" places everywhere have been torching their signature [adjective for hot] [mythical creature] [protein] rolls with them. Even as an avid cook, I bought one for myself to finish off steaks and such. 

That said, it was clearly obvious the kitchen staff in the back were overly-trigger happy with this gadget. My concerns were validated when the rest of our orders came out with that distinct and toxic flavor which ruined the entire dish, and subsequently the whole meal. I recommend the chefs experiment with different finishing methods that avoid the use of a torch if possible. Say for example...on an actual charcoal grill as indicated in their restaurant name.

Now onto what was good. The Kobe Beef Tendon was incredibly tender and juicy (once I got past the torch taste of course). The service was also  friendly and attentive.

I've been eating Japanese since around 1990 & NOT just sushi either. I'm also a foodie. That's not my point though because even if I hadn't had these dishes before, it's the flavor that matters, not what it's called.

1. I couldn't get a table. I had to sit at the bar which I don't like, as I don't like high chairs & 2 tables were empty, but I figured they were reserved.

2. I didn't find out until afterward that the prices are TERRIBLY expensive. For $4-9 you get ONE tiny item. So if it's a mushroom, it's one & tiny, if it's a skewer, it's one & tiny.

3. The food was tasteless in my opinion. The only thing that had a bit of taste to it was the ground chicken in the portobello mushroom & it WASN'T a HUGE cap, it was again, tiny.

I ordered their so called home made tofu for my agedashi tofu which I eat every time I eat Japanese, & it was nothing. Tasteless even after being soaked in their sauce.

Oh & I got 1/2 a portion that was $7!!!! That equals maybe 2 squares you'd get when you eat regular tofu. Agedashi tofu usually runs around $4-5.

Even the miso wasn't anything to write home about.

And yes the green tea was bitter, but that I could handle as some green tea is bitter. That was $3.50.

I walked out of there spending $43 (excluding tip so I paid around $50) & I was hungry, as ALL I ordered were 4 appetizer items & since they were all only one item on the plate, I was PISSED.

Nothing irks me more than when I lose a lot of money to a terrible restaurant. Had at least the food been really good, I could have chalked it up to just a pretentious restaurant, but it wasn't.

I had to eat again within 2 hours because I was starving.",0LHevpOrufWaU8pBiTc4gQ,8,0,1,It6mpbVxJ45gu52-8FFZ5w

Stand out dishes for me were the fried sea breem, the chicken on spinach, and anything pork--belly, cheek, ears.

Most important of course, is the food. We were there with a party of 11, and enjoyed ten different courses. Many of them will linger long in my memory. The house-made tofu, served with delicious accompaniments and their homemade soy sauce, was a revelation. Creamy yet firm, it absolutely redefined what tofu should be. The sashimi platter was literally a work of art. Each piece of fish was perfectly cut, and placed lovingly on the plate. The kobe skewer, studded with crispy garlic slices, was probably the best bite of beef I have ever had: charred on the outside, succulent, juicy and tender on the inside, it was ""close your eyes and moan"" good. Whole crunchy baby crabs? Delectable. As this parade of bites came out, one by one, over two and half hours, my only concern was would we be full, because each of the first courses consisted of a few bites: a small pile of charred trumpet mushrooms for example, a single scallop in its shell with a flavor-packed broth, or a single skewer of crispy pork belly. But the final savory course made sure that even this concern would be allayed, as it was a large pot of perfect rice, studded with tender flakes of salmon and a hearty portion of salmon roe that popped and danced in my mouth with salty, briny deliciousness. Last up was a perfect ball of strawberry sorbet, perfect for a come down after what was without a doubt, a meal of a lifetime. I cannot recommend Raku more highly.

My favorites were the Amber jack sashimi (baby yellowtail), Raku tofu (served chilled), chicken stuffed portabella robata grill skewer, and the crispy asparagus.  The presentations are lovely!  The sashimi was superb slices of mild fish that coated your palette like butter of the sea.

Raku has room for improvement.  They could be more inviting and helpful on the phone.  Furthermore, the phone ringing incessantly off the hook through your entire fine dining experience is quite annoying.  The bacon on the bacon wrapped mushrooms was borderline raw; lacked the crispy goodness I hoped for.  Many items were underseasoned and borderline bland.

We made reservations, and it's a good thing we did because the restaurant is tiny - like maybe 20 diners can sit down at tables and 4 more at the bar, tiny. We got an early table (hey, we have a little baby at home!) and we saw two groups come and leave because they couldn't get a table.
First, the drinks: an excellent selection of sake with a very informative menu, and a handful of bottled Japanese beers (and not just Asahi, either!). We both had new beers and they were both good; prices were average ($7-8).
For our meal, we started with the oft-reviewed hot and cold tofus. I thought the cold was really delicious, and the green tea salt and house soy sauce really made the dish pop. The hot was just meh. We didn't finish it. My husband is a miso soup lover, so he got a bowl of it and it was good, but just miso soup. It was packed with tofu, so after that, we were feeling kinda tofu-ed out. Next up were the specials (a blue-fin tuna and a yellowtail dish). They were both really good and the dishes completely came together with all the accompaniments. I always like blue-fin tuna and yellowtail, but these dishes were a cut above. Almost up to Nobu status, I think. 
Then we branched out with something kind of adventurous - uni with poached egg and salmon roe. Wow, it was so mushy and runny, I had to force down the second bite - ew (but that's just me). Finally, we got the juicy fried chicken (good, but not the best fried chicken I've had by a long shot) and the skewers of duck (thumbs up for that one). 
The final bill came out to about $135 with tip.
My overall thought is that it's good and I'm really glad I went to experience it once, but I'll probably never go back since I didn't love all the food and it's expensive. 
Also, I'm not sure, but I may not be cut out to eat the food they actually eat in Japan.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,0,3,ev41N_qHOeWMytYeXOqTjg
4047429,2013-10-10,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"This place is becoming popular with foodie tourists visiting Vegas. Make sure to make a reservation. Speaking of reservations, the food here is very... reserved. 

Because of our large party, they requested we have a kaiseki (set course of small dishes.) With each dish, you get one item, say, a tofu dish, a tiny bit of garnish, and sometimes a seasoning. The dishes are simple, giving the chef nowhere to hide poor ingredients or poor technique.

That said, this ""pure"" style of cooking is not for everyone. For example, I found the Hokkaido Hairy Crab very fresh, but delicate, lacking in flavor compared to Dungeness, Rock or Blue. It was served steamed with no sauce.

I've had kaiseki in Japan, where the dishes are also simply prepared, but with much more detail to flavor combinations: For example, a simple mushroom dish would come with 1 large bean and one vegetable in a simple sauce. But together, they made the dish. Simple but complex.

At least with the kaiseki at Raku don't expect to be wowed: it's just too simple. However, some of the stuff on the regular menu looked much more interesting: Uni in egg custard, for example.",vmMAPh4F-wM2PWSAFYToHA,2,0,3,1OH1mwxpagG-K2aq2EO8BA

The server was really great about explains things before I ordered as well as informing me of ways to eat certain things.

The foie gras,$18, with rice was delicious! Ive never had foie gras before and to me it tasted like a combination of chicken liver and bone marrow super Rich and creamy.

I also had the blue fin tuna. It was super fatty and it was paired well with the salty seaweed they made. 

It was a little on the pricey side. Everything is a la carte so it adds up quickly.",j4_1iTRs5VCXtEJbuSf1EQ,1,0,4,MzVATWUsMXG9yiEis86ngw
4048016,2010-08-04,7,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Hmm, so this is where all the Celebrity Vegas Chefs come to eat huh?

Raku is an Izakaya joint, so you will not find bento boxes or sushi here. Instead, you will find an array of Japanese Tapas that's simply cooked and prepared in a way that highlights the superior quality of the ingredients which is exhibited in the taste and texture of the food. If you're visiting Vegas, Raku is a destination spot must!

Raku is a hidden gem located in a small Korean Plaza off the Strip on Spring Mountain Road. It's a short 8 min cab ride which is about $9-10 each way which is not bad considering the high prices of Asian food on the Strip which all, if not most lack authenticity. 

Reservations are a must b/c it's a very small restaurant (seating for 30). Walk-ins are accepted, however, the wait was 6 hours on the night we went (they close at 3 AM), so again reservations are a MUST! 

I called one day prior, and we were fortunate to snag reservations for Friday, 7.30.10 @ 6 PM. WOOT!

FOOD/DRINKS:
*Lychee Cocktail ($8): Although strong in lychee flavor, it was a bit too syrupy sweet for me, so I had to chase it down w/ beer. If you like Muscat, you will like this cocktail.

*Blue Fun Sashimi (Special -$25): AMAZING! I'm very picky when it comes to my sushi and sashimi and for the most part, I will only dine at Japanese owned establishments. The quality and taste of the Blue Fin surpassed any I have tried in the past. It was the perfect temperature (not like most places where sashimi can taste fresh from the freezer) and had the most amazing buttery creamy texture w/ a hint of the ocean sea. It was accompanied w/ FRESH wasabi which gave a ever so light tingle in my nose.

*Asparagus Tempura ($4): YUM! The asparagus was coated w/ Japanese rice crispies and fried. It was lightly crisp on the outside and tender in the inside.

*Enoki Mushrooms Wrapped w/ Bacon ($2 for 2 skewers): GOOD! Enoki is very delicate in taste, so naturally it took on the salty, fatty, and smoky flavors from the crisp bacon. 

*Butter Scallop ($7): YUM! The scallop was soft, tender, sweet, savory, and smokey.

*Manila Clams (Special -$12): WOW! I've never tasted such tender and sweet clams as if they were freshly plucked from the ocean that AM. The accompanying broth was rich and comforting w/ a natural sweetness from the clams.  

*Steamed Egg Custard w/ Foie Gras ($9): OMG! The custard was velvety smooth and the foie gras flavor was prominent which added a luxurious richness to the custard. It was floating in dashi broth that was rich, savory, and sweet and the scallions added the perfect pop of freshness. 

*Tsukune ($3.50/ skewer): GOOD! The chicken meatball was perfectly grilled. The chicken was light, airy, and tender and very well flavored from black pepper. The char from the grill added a hint of smokiness. 

*Pork Cheek ($2.50/skewer): YUM! The cheek has the texture of a soft gizzard and the tenderness and flavor of a lean pork belly. The pork cheek was crisp, juicy, savory, and slightly sweet.

*Kobe Beef Filet w/ Fresh Wasabi ($9/skewer): SOOO GOOD! The Kobe (cooked medium) was succulently tender, moist, and very flavorful from the marbling. You can taste a hint of smokiness from the char marks and the fresh wasabi added a delicate pungent spicy and sweet flavor w/o masking the true flavor of the Kobe. Fresh wasabi is not like the pasty ones you find at most Japanese restaurants that makes your eyes tear and nose run. Although it can be pungent in big doses, it has a very smooth finish. 

*Live Uni Udon (Special - $28): DELISH! I'm an uni-whore, so I know good uni from bad ones. The uni was soft and creamy and tasted like a fresh ocean breeze (bad uni is slimy and tastes pungent and bitter). The handmade udon was perfectly cooked to a tender al-dente. The combination of the two was like a lighter version of pasta carbonara.

SERVICE:
EXCELLENT! Raku exudes Japanese hospitality. Upon entering, the waitresses were very warm and welcoming. Before ordering, our waitress brought a chalkboard of all their specials and went through each one, as well as, how it's prepared and served. As Ejay D. mentioned, you better ask how much the specials are b/c they are pricey compared to the regular menu items ($2-$15). And, b/c it's ""tapas"" style, your bill will rack up fast. 

Overall, the staff is very attentive, however, once it gets busy, the attentiveness wears down and you have to speak up if you want something.

AMBIANCE/DÉCOR:
Raku is sleek and modern. It follows the ""Zen"" approach that ""less is more"" and is simply decorated w/ fresh orchids, koi paintings, and small turf w/ cobble stones that lead to the bathroom.

Although small, tables are well spaced out, so you don't feel cramped and it was easy to maintain a convo.

Chefs DO know all the best places to eat b/c they're in the industry after all. So, if you're a hardcore foodie or an adventurous eater, Raku is a ""THE"" place you must go to when in Vegas!",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,10,9,5,sBbXo5cGr6G86vTrYw_8tA

Started with fresh tofu - would never had ordered it on my own, was silky, almost cheese like texture. Glad I got to try it.
Oysters with caviar - salty goodness
Sashimi sampler - good, but they gave us too much of one type of fish...and some were quite tough
Pork cheek skewer - overcooked and fatty (and one piece tasted of gas) - too bad bc these had potential
Wagyu skewer with fresh wasabi - unbelievably good. Tender, juicy, mouth watering.
Fried fish in broth - this was good, but not 'blow your mind' good.

4064556,2017-08-31,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku is my favorite restaurant when I come to LAS once year in past 5 years, the foods are outstanding, the experience is closet to Japan that one can get in Vegas, until this year, just like a slap on the face, even though the host lady apologized to me, but the management team needs to know & understand issues and fix it.    

In the past years, I used to make reservation in advance, but this year with busy work schedule, I could not able to make and wanted to have dinner there regardless.

Stood in line at 5:40 PM, got in at 6 PM when the restaurant opened, the host lady said it would be 90 min wait, stepped to the waiting area with few chairs and long high table and asked for glass of water and would like to order some drinks while waiting, she said yes, and passed me the menu.  After 10 min no one came by, I then asked a male server that I could order a sake, or beer, he looked at me like I was not belong here, as  second class of customers ""we have to take care of other people first, don't have time to take your order.""  I was in shock, would want to walk out, however I told myself, may be he had a bad start, and also be respectful as they are busy. I told myself, let's wait and let's it goes.  It's worth it the wait.  After 80 min in the waiting room, the host lady came back to refill my water but not asking me if I would like to order any drink (it seemed there was no communications among 4 of the servers), she handed me the menu.  At the same time, a party of 3 came in to the waiting room without reservations just like me, and within 5 min they requested to order drinks, and they were served promptly with sake tasting, and got a bottle of Sake, right there in front of my eyes, OMG! 

I looked at me & looked at them, what make me different than them.  I was in Japan many times, never felt racism like this time.  I never believe in racism with your own race, but now I know it.

Later, I expressed my concerns with the host lady, she apologized to me but I wanted the public to know:
1. Never come in without reservation otherwise it will be a long wait
2. If one is willing to wait, keep in mind she/he may not be served properly
3. Outstanding food, it's worth it to wait
4. Be aware of discrimination. There were many folks had similarity experience just like mine, and wrote their reviews too, check 1 star review.

Food - 5 stars

General rule of thumb: the grilled meat dishes are excellent -- pork, duck, steak you name it.  This is what they do best.  The fish is hit or miss.  Going forward, I don't think I'll be ordering fish from Raku.  I'm not sure how they do their sourcing, but my experience with the fish has been a bit splotchy.  The grilled vegetables are all solid.  Not anything to write home about but solid.  The tofu dishes are freshly made and also very good.  I love agedashi tofu, and theirs is one of the best I've had.  Anything with foie gras -- also very good.  The uni is very fresh and excellent (despite their splotchy record with their fish)

I asked for the sushi menu, and the waitress almost got angry at me as if I have had committed a crime. And told me that they don't serve sushi.

I ordered their special tofu. They say it's simply amazing.
I found it to be the most normal tofu in the world. Tasteless, unless you add spices and sauces and dressings and condiments. And only then it tastes ALMOST tasteless.

I have ordered crispy asparagus. Good. Not great. 

I have ordered their Green Tea Creme Brulèe. Delicious. But I still wonder why someone would put some whipped cream over it, which I have never seen before in such desert and I hope I won't ever see it again.

I ordered a cup of tea. It was way overdone, bitter. 

The waitress didn't speak english too well and didn't try to make herself understood. Same thing with the manager. The waitress cleaned my table after several minutes after retiring the plates, so there was soy sauce all over it, as it kept being even after she partially cleaned the table.

4108186,2018-03-14,4,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"The top item on my Vegas restaurant bucket list: check.

Raku is pretty much an institution with how well-regarded it is among ""those in the know."" I probably should've visited them years ago, and I did manage to try and love some of their food at the two most recent instances of the Aki Matsuri festival (an annual, local Japanese culture celebration) in Henderson.

I finally secured a reservation about a week ago and made my way to the absurdly crowded Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain near Decatur, also known as the home of so many other popular eateries. I was seated right away, to the relief of my companions who had arrived early instead of slightly late. Seriously, guys, they hold the reservation for 15 minutes!

Anyway, the service was great and the food was impressive throughout. I think I was looking for a few more moments of unbelievable flavor to make this a comfortable 5 stars rather than a 4-point-something. I'll describe what I had in the $100 omakase (with menu prices if I think it's a regular menu item):

- Raku's Tofu (not sure if this was $3.50 half portion or $5.50 full). Silky-soft tofu with bonito shavings and green onions. The soy sauce at the table did more than the green tea salt to add flavor. Would concur that it's a must-try here.

- Oyster (from Washington?) with Italian sturgeon caviar (special). Definitely one of the splurges of the meal, with everything in one bite-sized punch (except an herb garnish) of light saltiness and a sweet oyster.

- Sashimi platter (special). Two pieces per person of shima aji and kanpachi, and one piece per person of raw blue fin tuna, and marinated/grilled blue fin tuna. Everything tasted fresh, although I would've liked a little more flavor from the non-tuna fish. The marinated blue fin was fantastic and had a meaty appeal. I'm thinking that a lot of the hidden cost was found in this four-dishes-in-one plate.

- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped With Bacon ($3). A pretty tasty skewer, but not fantastic. I should add that the Raku festival booth offered so many awesome grilled meat and fish on skewers, and in comparison I wasn't amazed by this.

- Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi ($12). Another skewer, and one which I somehow found less impressive than other high-priced meat skewers which I've had off-site by Raku. The wasabi was fresh and didn't taste anywhere near overpowering. It's just that the meat didn't seem as fatty as you'd expect.

- Iberico Pork? ($10). Described by our server as acorn-fed pork shoulder cooked to medium-rare. I did find pink color as I got into the middle, and I didn't develop a stomachache. Now this one was amazingly juicy and fatty, with some hints of the acorn flavor.

- Fried Fish w/ a soy broth (special). We were all getting full and less attentive, but I think this may have been the baby Japanese seabass on the specials menu. it was tender and flaky. The broth was lightly sweet and enjoyable, and the mushrooms and what we thought was mochi in the bowl were also delicious.

- Foie Gras Bowl ($18.50). I think I'm just about over foie at this point, but it definitely was the richest (and likely most expensive) rice bowl that I've had, aside from chirashi. It's a decent portion of the controversial liver product, and aside from the marinade, it only had subtle flavors on its own.

- Green Tea Creme Brulee ($6). Some of the sugar glass was almost burnt, but it came with a matcha-ful creme underneath and a smooth matcha ice cream scoop on top, along with some nondescript whipped cream and a fresh raspberry garnish. Not the most interesting dessert, but you probably didn't come to this Raku for dessert, right? By the way, this was also served with a hot hojicha (roasted green tea) on the side, which was the true end to this great meal.

Overall, the pacing was good and some items were quite impressive, but I think I would've been just as happy with the $75 omakase (explained as equally portioned but with some less expensive dishes) or with choosing various items a la carte. As such, I will keep my review of Raku to 4 stars for now, with the expectation that I won't wait several years for my next visit. The flavors weren't always there, but the ingredients, presentation, and service were.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,9,4,BbfC5aougl-c-8lz9FAjMA

I ate here for the first time a month ago and still remember all the dishes! Lol.  It seems a base for a majority of the dishes was miso but it was very very subtle.  We started off with their house made tofu which was just delicious! I could eat the tofu just by itself. Perfect firmness and texture. It's a flavor taste palette where you go one by one, adding the ginger first-taste, seaweed&ginger next-taste, and then seaweed&ginger&soy sauce-taste.  A definite must try!  Next we went with a cold dish, the Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe.  The dish was absolutely delicious and all kinds of taste buds on my tongue! Sea Urchin doesn't overpower the dish at all and adds character to the plate.  The foie gras with glazed soy-based sauce was very yummy. It was very fatty and rich, melt in your mouth, fall apart on the touch.  Finishing off with cold green tea soba with poached egg cold noodles really hit the spot.  It's a very very light dish and the poached egg adds richness to the dish.  We topped our dinner off with a bottle of Yoshinogawa Echigo Junkai sake and of course Sapparo. The sake itself is not too overpowering and is considerably light/crisp.  The body itself goes down smoothly.",tpq10k8caBbqMbqNwpaE7Q,0,1,5,KXnHLPJdDpKiZZtq2St0cw

Raku bills itself as a robata, but it's got more than that: fresh fish, fresh sushi, fresh everything. Their master chefs create culinary delights, from pairing top grade caviar and kumamoto oysters, to traditional favorites like cold somen, or sukiyaki (albeit with legitimate, japanese imported A5-9 Wagyu!!). It's authentic Japanese cuisine, with high grade ingredients. 

They used to have oden, but is currently gone for the summer and I'm told may make a return in winter.

Some of my favorites include the Kobe Outside Skirt with Garlic, Apple Marinated Lamb Chops (Really some of the best lambchops I've ever had, frenched, and not gamey at all), the Iberico Pork, the Seared Scallops, the Fois Gras Don (Think a rice bowl - teriyaki sauce, lettuce, and fois gras... to die for), and tons more!

We got there and she said there will be a wait and they'll call us when  the seats are ready and it took this lady 3 times to get our phone number correct (it's not very loud inside the restaurant). She didn't tell us an estimate or anything of how long the wait will be. 

Food:
Miso soup- the best miso I've had in a restaurant. They definitely don't skimp on the tofu in it. The soup had thick pieces of tofu and mushrooms in it as well which was different but it was so good! Must try!
Yellowtail carpaccio- very light and refreshing. It tasted fresh and worked well with the sauce it came with but good without the sauce. 
A5 waygu skewer- a must to get even though it it pricey for one piece it was worth it. The meat just melted like butter when we ate it. 
Tsukune grilled chicken- pretty big pieces and it was seasoned really well. 
Kobe beef w/ garlic- the beef was very tender and I love garlic so this was good for me. 
Duck w/ balsamic soy glaze- duck was a little dry but it was okay, nothing special. 
Enoki wrapped w/ bacon- anything with bacon tastes good! 
Portabello w/ stuffed chicken- loved this as well. Chicken was cooked well and seasoned well. This is the same chicken used for the tsukune grilled chicken.

Don't let the outside fool you, as the inside is nicely decorated.  The restroom makes a good conversation piece, you just have to see it for yourself.  

We ordered the following:
Tofu Salad:  Reminds me of the Japanese version of a caprese salad.  Made with handmade tofu which is their specialty.  Hands down the best tofu salad I have ever tasted and close to the best tofu I've had in this country.  Especially good with the green tea salt.

Aji (prepared sashimi and fried):  Both ways were exceptional.  My only complaint was the sashimi pieces were small, but then it is about quality, not quantity.  Be prepared to spend $30 for this dish.

Agedashi Tofu:  Good dish as well.  Their special homemade tofu and the ikura topping were the highlights of this dish.

Kurobota Pork Cheek:  I like this, but my boyfriend wasn't a fan.

Tsukune:  Average at best.  I recommend you try something else.

Hamburg Steak:  Great dish.  Somewhat large, It is about the size of two hamburg steaks on top of each other.  They serve it in a sizzling hotpot with egg, mushrooms and onions.  When the waitress poured the sauce over the top, it didn't quite sizzle to her liking, so she was kind enough to bring it to the back so they could heat the pot.

To drink, we had the sake trio sampler for $18.  We were able to substitute two of the drinks for something else we wanted to try.  Our favorite was the Hananomai and we ended up ordering a few glasses at $15 each.

In the end, we experienced nothing but excellent service along with excellent food.  On top of everything, they are open until 3am.  This place is highly recommended if you are in the mood for great Japanese food.",ToxAsUPbU2Yzx3imGwAFbw,1,0,5,kawl4FsFL4wP-45jTnR1Bg

CONS: This place is very expensive, so don't come here starving.  Don't be fooled by the small price tags.  The portions are equally small.  For instance,  the $3 asparagus wrapped in bacon was the equivalent of maybe one whole asparagus spear. And the $7 scallop was one scallop.

Agedashi tofu: Just ok.  We didn't finish it. 

Grilled snapper. Very very expensive ($28) for very little fish,  and while it was cooked well,  it was grilled fish,  with no sauce or any special seasoning to make it stand out. Just plain grilled fish.  Rather boring.

Pork cheek: my other favorite dish.  Very tender and. flavorful.

I showed up at midnight on my way home from a restaurant Sunday night.  I've heard of Raku for a long time and I thought I'd at least go check out where it is.  I found it, it was empty, so I walked in.  I might as well have stepped across the Pacific Ocean when I crossed that entrance.  It was a different world.

Kani, the sashimi chef and condiment mixologist, greeted me.  Rei, the restaurant manager, joined in and I sat myself at the bar.  I was full, but I could sense it wasn't your ordinary late night restaurant -- it was magical -- and I wanted to stay.  So I ordered a beer, one for Kani, one for me.  I chatted with him and Rei about Vegas and random stuff.

Kani is a world traveler, having worked in San Francisco, New York, Hong Kong and now Vegas.  His friend, 10 years his junior, opened Raku and invited him to join in the operation as they worked together when they were back in New York.  He likes Vegas, though he doesn't think much of his local competitors in Japanese food.  The only alcoholic drink he'll drink is beer because he is at work.  He'll tell you what's fresh, so just ask.  He mixes the sauces in the restaurant himself...  and let me tell you, they are great condiments to the grilled skewers.

There's a mild but complex soy sauce that is a blend of different types of soy sauce and other mixtures, one of which is green tea.  There is a chili pepper blend that has a nice bite to it and a pepper soaked in some blend that is making my mouth water as I recall topping my kurobuta pork cheeks with it last night.  The salt has ground green tea mixed in.  There is a careful level of attention paid to every level of culinary experience at this place.

At that time, the restaurant was empty.  It reminded me of that painting, Nighthawks at the Diner, though Raku is nothing like that diner in that painting.  Raku is very intimate and elegantly decorated inside.  Dark lit...  it had a retro / nostalgic feel to it.  The fact that it was empty must have been because it was late and the economy is really hurting...  but Kani says they still get a late night rush before they close.  They're really busy from when they open at 6 pm to 11 pm -- so if you want to chat with the chef or staff, come late.

I never imagined I can have this good quality food late at night.  I always thought I'd have to resort to IHOP or some other gastronomic compromise -- but with Raku, you get good quality, late night food and good company.  It's your Vegas Japanese Cheers.  Three cheers for Raku!

The spot was tastefully decorated and the lighting was great for an evening meal. Not romantic (living in Vegas for a few months has left me believing it is impossible to have an intimate dinner at a strip mall restaurant.). 

We ate a lot of food. Fish, beef, and chicken. One of the evening's specials was a Spanish Mackerel prepared two ways-sashimi--style and gently fried. Never tried this little fish before and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the little bugger was. When the fried portion came out, including the head tail, fins, and spine we got a little bugged out. Call us what you will, I am pleased to report we did Not eat the head or eyes. But for those head & eye-eaters out there, Raku can accommodate your tastes. 

The beef and chicken options were served on skewers. They had a pleasant smokey flavor but were served nude i.e., no sauce. We also tried two salads; one with tuna and salmon sashimi, and one with buckwheat soba and veggies. Both were savory and would have been enough sustenance for moderate-eaters (clearly not us). 

Raku has a huge sake menu which evidences it commitment to an authentic Japanese dining experience. Okay, so does the head and eyes scenario. 

Overall a pleasant dining experience to be had at Raku. The service was attentive, the food well-prepared, and the balance between comfort and try-something-newedness was just right.

We ordered cold uni bowl with ikura and poached egg, wagyu skirt steak skewer, duck skewer, kanpachi sashimi, pig ears and half of their housemade tofu. They were all really delicious. The best part was their fluffy cheesecake, that was the best dessert in the life probably. One thing was that they dont have proper wine glasses, and they serve their wines in a glass without a stand, which made it a little awkward to taste the wine.

Goddamn, first, be prepared, this place is on the higher end of the cost spectrum.  That being said, the food is all really good.  

1)  Tofu with soy, ginger and green onions.  Delicious.  I believe the tofu was made in-house that morning.  It was some of the best tofu I've ever had.

2)  Uni from Santa Barbara - This, for me was the highlight of the meal.  If foie gras has an equivalent in the sea, I would say that this is it.  You could taste how fresh these uni were.  They were salty, fatty, savory and just goddamn delicious.

3)  Tsukune - elongated rods of ground chicken on bamboo skewers, awesome.

4)  Pork cheeks- a bit chewier than I thought, but still very good.

5)  Bacon wrapped enoki mushroom - Savory from the bacon and smokey from the grill.  Not too overpowering, still had some good enoki flavor.  Superb.

6)  Foie gras don - Essentially a rice bowl with a big fat piece of grilled Foie Gras.  Fucking delightful.

I felt the service to be somewhat like a tea ceremony, a carefully planned ceremony. The restaurant itself is quite small so it creates an intimate feel about it. 

My husband and I were in an adventurous and celebratory mood, it was my birthday, thus we opted to try a little bit of everything. I wanted to try a sparkling sake and the waitress kindly recommended the Tobiroku, which was dry and similar to a Champagne, it was very good. 

Then the waitress went through the daily specials. I must admit a faux pas, although I am active on Yelp, I did not read closely enough fellow Yelpers reviews where they mention the high cost of the specials. My bad. They were so worth it though. We tried the negitoro, blue fin sashimi and kanburi sashimi. They were all excellent. We also ordered the pork intestine oden, and a several items from the robata grill such as chicken thigh, lamb chop, portobello with ground chicken, shishito peppers and kobe beef liver. Everything was fantastic, the only item I could've done without was the beef liver. I'm not a huge fan of offal as it is, and I thought the liver had a chalky aftertaste. We ended the meal with a green tea crème brûlée. Itwas divine.

We were both over the moon about our meal and most definitely will be returning soon. Although the sashimi was excellent, it was pricey so I think we will return for the robata, oden and other items.

This time my friends and I had the omikase which is a multicourse meal that allows the chef to choose and highlight the best products that he can offer. There are two options at two different price points. As it is vegas I say bet big and go for it al. Every dish was spectacular but the most amazing highlights for me were the grilled king crab legs, baby barracuda and house made fresh tofu accompanied by scalloped salts or soy and green onion. Also notable was the amber jack sashimi which was accompanied by soy pickled seaweed and fresh wasabi.

So first and foremost, before you even think about stopping by Raku - make a RSVP by calling in!  They book up quickly and the venue is small enough/popular with tourists to fill up.  Saw a good number of people try to come in as a walk-in - only to be told to come back and RSVP.  

After getting to sit down, you'll be welcomed with a drink list (beers/soju/wine mostly), the normal menu and then a special chalkboard menu that they'll run down for you.  There's also the most adventurous item - the omakase that comes in a $75/$100 variation that seemed to look awesome - at least seeing what the people next to me received.  I unfortunately was not as hungry from an earlier restaurant outing so I opted to go a-la-carte.  I ordered the following:

-Okra: Was a pretty simple dish with some fun scallion toppings.  
-Pig Ears: Pretty good! Loved the use of the vinegar to give it a nice pop.  
-Foie Gras from the Grill: Doused in a teriyaki-like sauce - it was a delicious treat to end the meal.  
-Agadashi Tofu: A pretty solid dish although I don't think I love it as much as others do on here. Comes with a very interesting hot sauce, a tasty broth and some fish eggs on top.  
-Blue Fine/Toro Tartar: My favorite dish and one of the daily specials. Came in a beautiful presentation - tasted absolutely amazing and was such a smooth/easy eat. Adding tiny bits of wasabi that is included gives it the extra kick it needs to be one of the best tartars I've had.  

Loved the international red wine choice they had as well. There's a limited dessert menu although they recommend going to their sister dessert restaurant literally a few doors away.  

Parking-wise, it's in a small plaza - look for parking on the side streets or even at next door buildings.  The decor is simple but cool with some bar seats and tables all-around.  Service is stellar as well - great water checks, lots of good explanations and plate clears.  

I'm so excited to come back to Raku in the near future.  So let's go through the Cliff Notes: +RSVP early! Don't expect to just walk-in.
+Be adventurous! Expect both typical Japanese fare & a lot of unique twists. 
+Parking available all-around!

4287078,2008-06-17,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"The first thing that strikes me is I like the intimacy of the place. Its located near Chinatown, but off of Spring Mountain hidden behind some other generic plaza, near Savers. You can't really just stumble on this place. You need to be told about it. Someone needs to take you there. 

The dining area is just large enough to accommodate maybe six small parties and then five at the bar. I wouldn't recommend parties more than four. 

We got there at 10p and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. An hour later, the joint had filled in. 

The decor is very modern Japanese with wood accents and a beautiful ceramic wall behind the bar. 

All of the front of house staff speaks Japanese and are very knowledgeable about the food and drink menus. 

This is the kind of place you would take a businessman FROM Japan to to entertain and impress. I wonder if they never want to arrive for this reason. Keepin' it exclusive. 

They don't served any sushi. Mostly everything is either grilled or cooked hot pot-style (oden). 

Right off the bat, order five dishes per two people and then as things wind down, order as neeed. Its izakaya, so portions are small and pricey. My favorites are oden with mochi in aburaage, the scallop thing, Kobe fillet, yellowtail collar, pork cheek, and fresh tofu with tomato, konbu, and iriko. 

They also have asparagus or cherry tomato wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, grilled musubi, grilled corn (wtih the cob hollowed out, stuffed with potato ... I don't know how they do it). 

Some of their more exotic items include foie gras ($12 for not even a mouthful) , Kobe liver, grilled tendon (pork?), beef tongue cooked or carpaccio, chicken stick dipped in poached egg, duck with balsamic vinegar. 

The grilled items are all good and all, but they all have teriyaki drizzled all over them. I love teriyaki, but that's kind of cheating. 

Their desserts are all really good, too. I've tried the watermelon sorbet, chocolate bubbly, cheesecake, and lave cake with green tea ice cream. I can't pick a favorite. The lave cake is really light for a lava cake. But order it like 15 minutes ahead. The cheesecake is Japanese-style: steamed and fluffy. The watermelon sorbet. Just try it. 

To eat enough to fill you, you'll rack up a pretty hefty bill.The four of us last night, took it up to $340. Bring a big wallet. Don't bring a big appetite. I think traditionally, izakayas are drinking establishments with food to accompany food. Not the other way around. We're doin it wrong!

First course is tofu. Raku housemade tofu. Comes with bonito shavings, radish and chives. We sprinkled a little soy sauce on it. It's creamy and very tasty. Nothing like fresh tofu.

Next offering is an oyster from Japan with caviar. An off the menu item. We squeezed Meyer lemon on top as suggested. It was so good. The freshness of the oyster and the saltiness of the caviar matched perfectly with the little acidity of the Meyer lemon. Very good.

Asparagus covered in Japanese rice cracker is so tasty. The crunch is yum and the rice cracker is seasoned. The asparagus is tender and flavorful. Wow!!

Sashimi is next. Blue fin tuna, amber jack and hamachi. OMG! Nuff said. 

Hot plates are next. Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic robata. Cooked medium rare with toasted garlic on top. It melts in your mouth. Pork cheek robata has the right amount of fat and is a little crisp. 

Soup was next. An off the menu mixture of fish, mushrooms and rice cake in a dark dashi. 

Taro tartare is the last course before dessert. The taro matched perfectly with the marinated seaweed right below it. It was all on top of rice. What a perfect dish to end the food portion of the meal.

Poached egg with uni and salmon roe

Kobe Beef skirt with garlic skewer
Kobe Beef tendon skewer
Kurobuta pork cheek skewer
Pork ear
Apple marinated lamb chop 
Saikyoyaki special

Melting Chocolate cake
Fluffy Cheesecake

Unfortunately, we ordered WAAAAAY too much, and we were dying after... which is a shame because we really wanted to try their sister dessert shop right next door. 

Getting a reservation here was a real chore.  Maybe not French Laundry style, but it's definitely not a decision you make after you get to Vegas.  I'd highly recommend making a reservation before your Vegas trip.  I made the reservation about a week in advance, and I got a pretty crappy time on Saturday (like 9pm).  We showed up early anyways just to look around, and luckily there was a cancellation and they let us move into the 7pm slot, which was perfect.

We sat at the bar, which was great as you can see the chef's preparing food for you right there.

I am sure I will forget something but we ordered:

Huge Langoustines - Both grilled and raw.  Definitely prefer the raw method :)

Bluefin Tuna - Omg, it was sooo good.  I'm not sure it was the toro, but it was still super super tasty. 

A Whole Agedashi Tofu -  Ok, this is huge.  Bad idea to order the whole one.  If you're just here with 2 people, order the smaller order, it'll be enough to taste it.  I thought it was good, but not as much to die for as other people have made it seem.

Grilled Saba - Delicious, but I do love Saba. 

Kobe Beef Skewer - Wonderful.  Not huge.  It had a nice wasabi salt garnish on it as well which enhanced it.

Kurobata Pork Belly - Ok, at this point we were just too stuffed to finish it, which is kind of sad, because it was a waste, but this pork belly was extremely good.  I do prefer the chinese style preparation of this, but still, it was very nice.",eMpfBfTjsarX4sS3udrUdQ,1,1,5,1qqilljhbYDeXMwLMHwOlQ

Wanting to sample the best of what Raku had to offer, my friend and I ordered the premium omakase (11 courses / $100 per person).  If you're more budget conscious, there's a cheaper omakase for $75 per person.  Our waitress explained the difference between the two in relation to the day's premium ingredients.  Although I suspect you could order the same or similar dishes for a lower price, I didn't feel like we were overcharged given the quality of the food.  

The omakase included the following items: Raku's tofu (4/5), mushrooms and greens (4/5), assorted sashimi (5/5), crispy asparagus okaki (5/5), miso soup with langoustines (4/5), Kurobuta pork cheek (5/5), butter sautéed scallop / duck with balsamic soy sauce (4/5 for duck), kobe beef filet with wasabi (4/5), fried whole fish in dashi (5/5), foie gras don (4/5), green tea creme brûlée / tangerine sorbet (1/5 for sorbet).  My favorite dishes were the the assorted sashimi, the Kurobuta pork cheek, and the fried whole fish in Raku's signature dashi.  What made the sashimi great was the quality of the fish (fatty tuna, langoustines, amberjack) as well as the thoughtful garnishes served alongside the fish (pickled chrysanthemum, marinated nori, freshly grated wasabi).  Of the skewers, the Kurobuta pork cheek was my favorite, as it was perfectly cooked and had a nice flavor.  (I would note that all of the skewers tasted similar to one another due to their soy-based sauces.  The kobe beef stood out for its use of wasabi, but the beef itself didn't seem particularly noteworthy.)    The fried whole fish had a nice mix of vegetables, crispy fish skin/bones, and tender meat.  The signature dashi also gave the dish just the right amount of saltiness.

What nearly ruined an otherwise delicious meal was undoubtedly the dessert.  If you don't suffer from any allergies, you'll likely get the green tea creme brûlée.  Since I can't eat dairy products, I received tangerine sorbet instead, but the entire dish seemed more like shaved ice than sorbet (too much syrupy liquid, large chunks of ice, etc.)  The primary problem with the sorbet was its unappetizing taste, which seemed like a bitter mix of citrus and alcohol (sake?).  This was so bad that I left more than half of it in the bowl...

Service was pretty good for a restaurant of this caliber.  The servers did a nice job of explaining what each item was and how they recommended eating everything.  Although they forgot that I had mentioned my food allergies, they were very apologetic and brought a substitution out promptly.  (The substitutions weren't equivalent in price to the normal dishes, which I felt was a bit disingenuous.)  

I would highly recommend making reservations in advance, as the restaurant is rather small and fills up quickly.  We called five days in advance for a Saturday dinner reservation, but couldn't get anything until late that night.  We opted to show up sans reservation at opening to ensure we would get seated right away, and we were given space at the bar upon entering.

Despite several missteps, this was a great dining experience, and I would  recommend Raku to others!  Although it's a ways off from the Strip in Chinatown, it's definitely worth the short drive!",ZMc68qAU0oKEbJqercHPYA,2,1,4,1I121uHkESsiY35kk9s3hg

Every dish ordered was amazing but there is a list of must-try items:

1. Half n Half order of the amazing Agedashi Tofu and Cold House Made Tofu.  The Agedashi broth was delicious and the tofu had the perfect fried coating.  The star of this dish was the Cold Tofu.  The texture was like panna cotta and melted in your mouth.  Combined with the delicious sauces and spice blends on the table... a party in the mouth.

2. Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard.  Honestly it may sound a little off putting or an interesting dish, but HOLY CRAP.  This is a rich dish and not for the faint of heart, but the richness and sweetness of the egg custard combined with the salty flavor of the foie gras was divine.

3. Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic.  Kobe is always good and combined with the crispy garlic slice made for a great spicy/rich and crunchy/tender balance of flavor and texture.

4. Enoki Mushroom Wrapped Bacon.  Take one part bacon and one part mushroom and you have such a delicious dish.  The enoki provides a surprising crunch and the bacon fat singsssssss.  This is a deceptively complex dish exploding with flavor.

5. Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce.  The sauce on this dish is lick-the-plate good.  What else is there to know?

I've been dying to try this place for a while, but 1) I could never get a reservation and 2) the 1-2 friends that I have couldn't find time to come with me. I finally got my roommate and sister in-law to come with me yesterday and invited my sister-in-law's friends too. There was a total of 6 peeps and the only reservation available was at 6:30 PM. The hostess took my reservation and explained that we all need to be present for the reservation and because of the size of our group, we had to get omakese. 

Personally, I like omakese, which is a set Chef's Choice Prix Fixe items. The group agreed on the 60/person, but we had no idea what was to come. 

1. Raku Tofu - Housemade tofu. Super fresh and we had specific instructions on how to eat it.  
2. Assorted Sashimi - F-in' delicious. Some of the freshest cut fish that simply melts in your mouth. 
3. Bora Bora appetizer - chilled, lightly battered pieces of fish serve with an onion/vinaigrette. 
4. Grilled mushroom skewers - meh. 3 button mushrooms on a stick. underwhelmed. 
5. Grilled baby barracuda - tender, flake fish. The server deboned it for us, but watch out for little bones while you eat. Tasty, but pretty simple dish. 
6. Deep-fried Blowfish - light batter, served with a wedge of lemon. Reminded me fish and chips.
7. Grilled Chicken meatball - not good at all. It reminded me of a gourmet chicken nugget, shaped into a drumstick and served with a popsticle stick. sadly, this was the most memorable, because it didn't flow with the rest of the meal. 
8. Kobe Beef Skewer w/ garlic chips - Tender chunks of delicious beef. 
9. Salmon & Salmon Roe Fried Rice - Awesome. light and flavorful.
10. Homemade Strawberry Sorbet - Tasted like a virgin strawberry daiquiri drizzled with condense milk. 

I'm surprised that the bathroom doesn't get reviewed much. It's one of the nicest bathrooms I've every seen in a restaurant. The toilet is equipped with a japenese butt-washer. For your viewing pleasure, there's a tropical fish tank that is on the opposite wall. The automatic faucet is ridiculously responsive and the floors are so clean you could eat off of it. 

My regrets:

1. Omakese - There were items that were delicious, but items that I did not like. The next time I come here, I'd like to go a la carte. 

2. Bathroom - I should have pooped here and enjoyed the fish tank and butt washer. 

3. Overeating - I knew I should have stopped, but when my sister-in-law asks me to help her finish, it's hard to turn down more food. 

Overall, I had a pleasant experience. I thought the omakese menu was just okay.  Unfortunately my favorites were the tofu and sashimi, which makes me sad since that's not really what was supposed to be their specialty. The service was top-notch and the bathroom was amazing. I would definitely come back, but do things differently. 

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,4,1,4,RwXYCH1aa89UM198XJj0PQ

4396960,2010-10-28,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"This is a truly unique dining experience and one that I would highly recommend to the serious foodie. It is about 10 minutes from the strip. It is hard to find and spot. We had no trouble with reservations but I could see where you could.

The staff is Japanese so there could be a language barrier, unless you speak Japanese, but you can work through it. The service was very good. They stayed on top of things and were very pleasant. 

All of the dishes are small so don't feel bad about ordering 10-15 items off the menu. Once the food starts coming, they keep a good, steady pace. This is not a sushi joint at all. This is a place where you can step outside your comfort zone and be pleasantly rewarded.

The chicken breast was as good as I have ever had, anywhere. All of the skewered items were wonderful. The chefs are like artisans. There is as much substance to the presentation as there is to the dishes themselves. I ordered 10 items and regret not ordering more. Not because I was hungry but because I wanted to push the envelope just a bit more. 

The bathroom was even a treat. It had patterned flowers on the floor and a pseudo-rain forest overhead (complete with the sounds of chirping birds overhead).

This is definitely fancier than I usually venture, but I was in town visiting a friend and he really wanted me to try this place and I hadn't had anything to eat all day and there wasn't a wait to sit down and he said that there is always a wait and that it is hard to get reservations here etc etc so I figured I would just go with it.

All the dishes are put together really well and are served with an explanation of what the dish is and suggestions are given on how to best enjoy the dish (with different sauces or all in one bite, etc.).  There is definitely a higher level of service and I appreciated the respect that we we received despite me being in basketball shorts and a t shirt (that was what I was wearing during the day (110 degrees) and I didn't know what we were doing for dinner ahead of time).

Everything was fresh and the presentation was fantastic.  

I tasted tofu like I've never tasted before.  The kobe beef skirt with garlic was just okay to me.  The pork cheek was really good.  The tomato wrapped in bacon was good, but I wouldn't order it again.  My friend really like this one and wanted to order it so I obliged.  We ordered another fancy beef dish, I believe it was wagyu.  It was good, but I was disappointed.  It didn't blow my mind and was sort of a let down.  It was also on the pricey side.  I think it was a weekly special.

I really liked all the sauces that you can add to your food.  I also like all the different parts of some of the more intricate dishes.

If you have any questions about anything, please ask your server.  Everyone assisting us was really helpful and had lots of good recommendations and advice.

We split a fluffy cheesecake for dessert.  Certainly unique and tasty without being too heavy or rich.  My friend was in love with this dessert and was talking about it right when we sat down.  I'm sort of intrigued to look up how to make it.  It had an oreo cookie crust base.

I'll try to add some pictures that I took. 

We ate like kings and were both full at the end.  I think the entire meal ran 60 or 70 per person after tax and tip including his one beer.  For me that is not something I normally do, but for people who typically spend that type of dough on dinner, this is definitely a place you should try.

4404880,2016-12-28,3,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Came here for dinner at the suggestion of my foodie brother in law.  The first thing you should know about this place is that it isn't your run of the mill Japanese restaurant.  You will not be ordering a bento box with chicken teriyaki and california roll at Raku.  Basically the way it works is that everything is a la carte and served on skewers.

One item you should probably try is their Tofu.  Apparently they make their own.  I am not a fan of Tofu at all but we ordered some and I gave it a try.  It actually wasn't bad.  I wouldn't order it for myself but I didn't immediately want to spit it out.  Normally I can't handle the texture of Tofu but Raku's is pretty firm, almost like a cheese.  The fact that I didn't hate it means that for people that like Tofu, this stuff is probably excellent.

I will admit that ordering at Raku can be a bit of a challenge.  There aren't many ""simple"" dishes on their menu.  Most of the beef dishes Raku serves are a bit too exotic for my taste, (tendon, silver skin, liver), no thanks.  They might be good I just wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try them.  I ended up ordering the Outside Skirt with Garlic, Chicken Breast Steak and Asparagus with and without Bacon.  Everything was quite good, especially the chicken. Keep in mind that as you are paying for each skewer and other than the chicken breast the portions are quite small, the bill can add up pretty quickly.  Count on probably spending about $30 - $40 per person and that is probably a bit on the conservative side.

Raku also has an extensive Sake menu.  No basic 5 or 6 types of rice wine for Raku.  They've  probably got at least 20.

If you like Japanese food you will certainly enjoy Raku.  Ordering can be difficult as I would think most Americans aren't used to Aburiya style restaurants.  But the menu is varied and interesting and the food is tasty.",z8ie74vdxx-28KPHA5EVlg,3,3,4,Pe66wVbx07Afl62Y7SIBXg
4413818,2016-10-23,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"STELLAR reviews for Raku had us totally hyped up and ready to eat the night away! But we were a little let-down by the food and the slowness of the kitchen staff. 

[Reservations]
We called the day before (Wednesday) and were told that the only available reservation available on Thursday night was at 11pm. Disappointed but hopeful, we tried calling again on Thursday at 5pm and were told that there was ONE table open at 6pm and we immediately raced over - ready to feed our glutinous selves - yesss! When we arrived at 6pm, we were seated immediately and were surprised that there were SOOO many empty tables around. 3-4 groups also walked-in around this time - no reservations - and were seated immediately as well. The idea of reservations here is a total illusion!!

[Food]
Between the 2 of us we ordered: 
Poached Egg w/ Uni & Ikura - simply done. Poached egg, uni, and salmon roe mix together for a light, flavorful cold soup. 

Foie Gras w/ Glazed Soy Based Sauce - generous but a little overwhelming because of how generous and sweet this was. 

Butter Sauteed Scallop - this made me so sad. I love scallops, but this one tiny scallop piece was so overcooked. It was unnecessarily chewy, and the buttery sauce overwhelmed the natural sweetness of the scallop. 

Kobe Beef Outside Skirt w/ Garlic - Yelpers raved about this dish. Taste-wise, I enjoyed the charred taste, but it was just a little too chewy for my taste. 

Kodai (One of the Daily Specials) - we had this fish half-grilled, and half-fried. Half-grilled, it was just alright. Half-fried this dish was TASTY!!! They de-bone the fish, bread it lightly, and fry it. It's served with a japanese rice-mochi thing and mushrooms, all soaking in a soy-based sauce. Fried = WAYYYY better than the grilled version. 

Yellowtail Carpaccio - simple, fresh, nothing amazing. 

Agedashi Tofu - I expected this tofu to be amazing because they brag that it's homemade. It DID taste fresh, but the texture isn't a smooth, silky one. It's a bit rough, and definitely a very textured tofu. 

Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard - BEST thing we had that night. Egg was subtly mixed with the foie gras for a creamy, rich texture of goodness. mmmmmm! Sooo yummy. RECOMMEND THIS DISH FOSHO!!

Portion sizes are SMALL and even with the above 8 dishes, we were still hungry.

[Service]
Servers were friendly and attentive, but there was a serious back-up in the kitchen. First 30 mins: we received only 1 of our dishes. 30 mins later: we received 2 more dishes... and were impatiently looking around to see what was going on. Annoyingly, the tables around us were happily eating away. Another 30 mins later: 1 more dish came. Last 30 mins: the last 4 dishes came all at once. Over the course of 2 hours, the food came out INCREDIBLY SLOWLY, and the small portion sizes each time definitely didn't help our hanger.

Raku is WAYY overhyped. Only a few of their famous dishes were actually winners. Lots of other great Japanese places around this area, and I would recommend checking those out instead.",WMLrJpSqeQU9us9FTKJFew,4,1,3,mrTYAtxgamSSsYLDCNom-w

And do not come here if you are really really hungry.  That's my warning to all the guys out there.  My friend and I arrived at 630pm.  Raku opens at 6pm.  Okay, all the tables are full.  Hostess estimates the wait is 30-45 minutes.  We did not get seated until 8pm!  Total torture because the mall had a top rated ramen shop and a famous chinese restaurant.

Each dish takes around 5 minutes to come out and it comes out individually, which is the style of izakaya.  Thus, my stomach digested each dish before the next one even came out.  My hunger level stayed the same.  All the dish were delicious though.  Maybe because of the wait but I like to think everything was cooked carefully.  My favorite dishes were: enoki mushroom with bacon, deep fried chicken, and the bluefin sashimi special they had.  Thankfully, I ordered an Oyako Don (chicken and egg) to satisfy my hunger.  

Service was okay.  I didn't like being told that we had to finish by 930pm as we were being seated, despite waiting for over 1.5 hours.  I debated between a 3 or a 4 star rating.  I gave Raku 4 stars because it is not your average Japanese restaurant.  The food is definitely high tier.

Here's how you eat it... first, enjoy the broth without mixing in the little toppings sitting on the puffy tofu cloud. This is a dish that morphs in flavor as you eat it. So, broth then broth + tofu (careful - extremely hot when it first is set before you). Then as you eat your way around the garnish-toppings, toss in a little of the roe and toasted seaweed, and green onion. As you complete the dish, you'll notice the flavors changing as the broth is flavored with those little items. 

So simple, so heavenly. I dare anyone who doesn't like tofu to not love this dish. Phenomenal.

Pork cheek - very yummy with robata flavor. Duck + balsamic, also tasty, but only three pieces. Chicken in baby portabella - ok.

The chef at é by José Andrés told me that local and visiting chefs choose Raku as their place to dine. 

The final push for me finally came when a food blogger/line cook at a very hot LA restaurant who recently told me that he would drive from LA to Las Vegas just to eat at Raku. I've seen his Instagram feed. I trusted his opinion as much as I trusted the chef at é by José Andrés who told me about Raku years ago.

To me, off the strip is where you'll find the best food in Vegas.  This is where the locals and chefs eat. 

I'm not so much a fan of celebrity chefs. Nor am I a fan of the white table cloth restaurants on the strip charging minimum $500 per person to eat by a Picasso and then you're left with the desire to eat at Shake Shack or In-N-Out Burger after that really expensive horse and pony show.

Raku is exactly what I expected and more. This visit to Vegas was just to eat at Raku.

This is a restaurant, or shall I say food mecca or food nerd pilgrimage site, is where die hard food lovers and sake connoisseurs eat and collide. They had quite the extensive list of sakes to choose from. 

The two different styles of recommended fresh tofu I had were out of this world amazing. The textures and flavors were both unique and equally delicious. I ordered some of the more unsual items on the menu such as the rare tuna from Japan and the pork cheeks. I don't eat chicken at place like this.  I can't wait to return to Vegas and try more at Raku, as well as visit nearby Sweets Raku.

This place doesn't seem so popular with Yelper Angelenos who all seem to be chasing the big name celebrity restaurants on the Las Vegas strip. Feels like a little secret for those willing to go the extra mile to find the best food in Vegas.

It sounds like the best and most interesting restaurants in Vegas are off strip from the conversation I had with the chef. And, that's what I did on this trip to Vegas. I enjoyed Vegas even more so off the strip exploring restaurants than any of my Vegas trips dining on the strip.

4451872,2014-05-30,4,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"What brought us in: a multitude of different sounding foie gras dishes.

To start with, the foie gras was a disappointment. Out of everything we had here it was my least favorite. We decided to go out on a limb and order the steamed foie gras with egg custard dish. It came out last, although I believe it was the very first thing we ordered (odd). This foie gras was probably one of the most disappointing pieces of foie gras I have ever had. It tasted much more like a breast of duck grilled. The egg custard had a smooth texture and was sitting in what tasted to me like miso soup. ($10)

Moving on, we ordered ""off menu"" from their chalkboard specials. So, we went all out, because why not? We ordered the monk fish which came in a bowl swathed in some sort of brown jello. The jello had a taste I just could not come to terms with while the monk fish was much like a fish pate, but my friend said it looked like cat food. ($10)

Next - Wagyu Beef Sashimi - 6 very thinly cut pieces. Mouth-watering and delicious. Absolutely superb, but I would have liked to have had 6 more. ($20)

On to the skewered items we shared. Kobe Beef with Wasabi - also delicious, just like the wagyu, only this time, grilled with a distinct flavor and of course, it was great quality meat. Pork cheek - also delicious, I am a fan of fatty items like this. 

That's all she wrote. We skipped dessert because we were afraid it would come out in tiny portions and we were ready to go because we had already spent a buttload of money and we were still hungry.

The food is superb quality, obviously. Presentation is perfect. But I just did not feel as though it was worth the money I spent to still be hungry afterward. I think this was one of those, ""Well, we tried it, so that's all."" types of places for myself and my friend. 

The restaurant itself it small, but decorations and seating and ambiance are pluses in my book for a restaurant of this size. Service was also good, our waters were kept filled and everything came out in a timely manner (save for the foie gras).

Make a rez, as we were there on a Wednesday night without one, and although they allowed us to have a table we were given a time limit on how long we could be there.

We didn't have a reservation, but were lucky to get two seats at the five person bar that looks into the kitchen (this may have been a 'bad' seat to some, but I couldn't imagine a better one). Not more than ten minutes after we sat down a guy walked in and asked the following questions (remember this is Monday). Q: 'Do you serve alcohol?' A: Just beer and wine; Q: Do you have sushi? A: No sir. Q: Can we get a table? A: For how many? Eight people he responded. A: Uh, No(sweetly, but without a hint of hesitation). The fact that he thought he could get a table for eight seemed utterly preposterous, and actually was. Plus, he obviously thought this was Sushi Roku in Caesar's, a common confusion amongst tourists. As we left at around eight o'clock, we overheard another gentleman. Q: Table for two? R: Not until 10 PM. Bottom line: make a reservation!

Now for the food. I can best describe the dishes at Raku as 'Japanese tapas.' Most of the items are done in individual portions on a Robata grill (see description on blog)) or are enough for each person to have a couple of bites, more or less. We ordered the agedashi tofu (home-made deep-fried tofu in dashi broth), sashimi salad (they don't have sushi, yet sashimi is quite prevalent), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, Kurobuta pork cheek, and steamed clams. When you order you're not sure what dish will come out when, but you can guarantee it won't come out quickly and you won't care once you try it. The sashimi salad ($9) came first tonight, and was the perfect start to the meal. It consisted of ridiculously fresh salmon, toro (tuna), and yellowtail (hamachi) on a bed of baby spinach, topped off with crunchy fried onions. The dressing consisted of three unique sauces that converge at the bottom of the bowl by the time you finish, enhanced by a swipe of a creamy and spicy fourth sauce on the side of the bowl. It's really hard to describe it without using the words 'oh my God.' Then we had the agedashi tofu ($9), another dish best described with the words 'oh my God.' The different elements that make up this dish clearly exemplify the talents of the chef/owner, Abriya Raku. First of all, the tofu is made in house, and will make you think differently of tofu ever after. You can see how it might be easy to be a vegetarian if you could eat this on a regular basis. The dashi broth is sweet with intense flavor, and the mini accoutrement such as the baby mushroom heads (a variety I can't identify) floating on the surface, and the beads of salmon roe just pop in your mouth providing complimentary bursts of goodness. Next we moved onto our bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms ($2.50) and Kurobuta pork cheek ($2.50), both cooked on the Robata grill. Somehow this grill imparts an indescribable flavor into the food, even though the marking from it is subtle. My husband described it best: ""You could put s*** on that grill and it would come out tasting great."" You'll be happy to know s*** isn't on the menu of interesting items like beef gut soup, but I think he's right. We finished with the steamed clams ($12), a special for the evening, which were the least impressive dish of the night. The broth was gentle in flavor without being dull, and the dish definitely showcased the clams themselves. The problem, however, is that manila clams aren't that exciting on their own and kind of need a powerful sauce to make them better (i.e the clams at Cafe Chloe or Panna Thai). This was the only dish we probably wouldn't order again, not because it was bad, but because so many other items shouldn't be passed up.

The last thing I would like to talk about are the condiments on the table. Most dishes don't require them, but I think you should still try them to broaden your horizons. The soy sauce (bottle at back right) is a unique blend of five different imported kinds and will make you re-think soy sauce the way the tofu made you re-think tofu. The bottle in front of that is a chili sprinkle to add a little heat if you like, and to the left of that is special salt based on the sun-dried sea salt made in the classic Shiota style. Behind that is aged vinegar with peppers. Each of them is constructed with care and love, and if there is that much effort spent on the condiments, it is only obvious that every other dish on the menu will be prepared with the same level of passion and expertise. If there is only one restaurant I've recommended that you must try, this is it.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,3,2,5,uYlm8_pn0_ZpNRB6fIiRdA

4497963,2013-07-08,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I'm not a huge fan of yakitori but I would have to say that this is probably the best place that I've ever had for yakitori.  If you love yakitori, you should definitely try this place out if you're in Vegas.  

Reservations are really hard to get and I'm not sure why they are so strict on their reservations.  We had our reservation for 11:30pm on a Wednesday night (before 4th of July) and we called to try to move it up earlier but the earliest they would give us was 11pm.  We got there around 11pm and the place was empty.  Pretty much only 25% filled.  It's not a huge place by any means so it was weird that it was so empty when all I kept hearing about was the long wait.  It did get packed toward the end of the night around 12:30am-1am when we left.  

We sat down and ordered the following (must orders are ranked first):  

Juicy Deep Fried Chicken - This is a MUST order.  If you go here and you don't want to order anything else that I listed, you have to at least try this dish.  It's amazing!!!!  We ordered two of these to split between four people.  It comes with 6 pieces but it's so good that you will be wanting more.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.    

Foie Gras with Glazed Soy Based Sauce - Must order if you like Foie Gras.  I don't like foie gras and therefore, I don't eat it but my husband loved it.  It comes in a small size but it's perfect for two to share.  

Kobe Beef Tendon - This is another must order.  I don't even like tendon but we ordered this to try and it was melt in your mouth yummy goodness.  It's definitely a must try even if you don't like tendon.  

Iberico Pork - Another must order.  It's iberico pork, need I say anything more?  

Chicken Thigh - similar to other places but still moist and juicy and still really good for yakitori.  

Agadashi Tofu - this dish is very similar to what you can get at other places, this was probably the better tofu of the two tofu dishes that are offered.  We all agreed that this was the better tofu of the two but it's tofu.  So nothing that unique about it.  

Asparagus with Bacon - similar to other places, it's asparagus and bacon.  You can't really do much else with that combo.  

Raku's Tofu - this tofu was really bland and you're supposed to eat it with the seasonings that are provided to you at your table.  If anything, there wasn't really anything unique about this tofu.  I would order the Agadashi tofu over this one.  

Direct Flamed Eggplant - this was unique and different but it was pretty bland.  I would have to say it was the worst dish of the night.  You can put some flavorings and seasonings on it to make it taste better but it was just plain.  

The portion sizes are small so if you have four people, it's good to get 2 skewers of each item to share.  Plus, this place is pretty pricey as well so be prepared to drop some serious cash but for some good food.   Definitely on my list of places to go when in Vegas!",AgJxCwwC90WwUOv7g3tiXQ,2,0,5,8DmhaVVk_UyznXgJtgy3aA

Portion is small, but every bite is heavenly.

We especially love the Kobe beef with Wasabi... we were very reluctant at first since we're not a fan of horseradish and wasabi..but this one is different..definitely a must order dish everytime you go there...although it's $8/skewer.

We also love love love the lamb chop...homemade tofu...yumm yummm..never thought that tofu could taste that creamy and tasty.

Do prepare to spend over $100 for 2 people if you wish to come home with a full stomach...but it's definitely worth it.

Service was very nice... everyone.. although they didn't speak a fluent English was very friendly and helpful.

We also ordered the sake sampler..but since we're not a sake fan.. we thought they were too strong ...

We will certainly go back if we're in Vegas again... it's definitely worth the hassle to take a cab off the strip.

The homemade tofu is ridiculous.  Soft and nutty.  Still haven't tried the agedashi tofu (fried). There were a lot of dishes we tried but what the heck tofu?  Why you make carnivores look bad? 

Other highlights were the pig ears and the foie gras on rice.  Def need the rice to help cut the fat. Or you can ask sake or beer to help with that.

There were seven of us and we were promptly sat in the back dining area, where we all had the omakase. We ordered some other specialties as well. But some of my favorite dishes were the Wagyu beef sashimi with wasabi, Agedashi tofu (and I normally never really eat tofu, but the flavor was spectacular), poached egg with sea urchin and roe, and the sashimi was so fresh and prepared perfectly.

First thing I have to talk about is the homemade fresh tofu. I DO NOT LIKE TOFU, but the tofu here is amazing. It is a must order. The texture is very soft where it kinda reminds me of a freshly soft ball of mozzarella cheese that is unsalted. 

Sashimi - The amberjack and bluefin toro is amazing. Portion is small, but one of the BEST sashimi I've had. Texture is so soft and chewy at the perfect temperature to eat sashimi. Taste gets amplified 2X MORE with their fresh made wasabi.

Yakitori - The beef, pork, and duck here are all amazing. So tender with great flavors. Portions are definitely small but quality is great.

LASTLY the SCALLOP - One buttered large scallop which is about $10 per scallop is so delicious. It is cooked and soaked in their sweet/salty marinade which is extremely delicious.

""Ode to Fatty Deliciousness and Overindulgence""

My return to Raku took almost 2 years, but it came when I debated going to restaurant week anywhere, trying Central at Caesars where I was before this, or getting back here finally.  The calling came to me after I saw Central's menu and was bored by it.  I drove over and had a bit of an odd time getting a spot at the bar which had 3 empty seats due to a reservation people had later in the night.  Finally after standing for awhile, I got seated at the bar.  In the mean time, Chef Hiro-San came out from the kitchen to say hello - it had been so long but he remembered me again.  I knew I was in good hands on the grill!  The chef behind the counter gave me a free starter salad with shiitakes, bonito flake, and what appeared to be Chinese celery or fennel.  I hate celery and it tasted neutral so it probably was fennel :)

I ordered off the specials first (without seeing any prices, woops!) - first, kinae dai sashimi = golden snapper...with house-made pickled ginger shreds.  It was beautifully bright red and tasty, but definitely a lean fish and ironically the most expensive thing I ordered (when I saw the bill later).  It was my only non-fatty item and so great that I tried it as it was fresh that day, but I liked everything else better.

Next came the kushiage tofu special, a new dish.  It is a lightly fried tofu topped with uni and a dashi broth.  When it was presented to me, I was told to stir everything together.  This totally is a dish for me since I love tofu, I love agedashi tofu, and I love uni.  Made for me!

Thirdly, my favorite dish of the night - I told my waiter (also from The Ka days) that I love fatty fish and he told me they had salmon belly.  I said okay, but how I love hamachi!  He checked and lo and behold, ONE hamachi belly left!  He hooked it up BIGTIME!  Grilled hamachi belly with crispy skin topped with green onion, shredded daikon on the side, and ponzu dipping sauce (I added togarashi to it mmm!) - This was so OFF THE HOOK that I almost exclaimed that out loud!  Fatty, crispy, soft, salty, citrus-y....need I say more?  I would do this again and again!

After all of that, I opted for the foie gras don - I didn't even notice the back of the main menu until that and I knew I was rich-dish-mish accomplished (rhyme fo sho) so I was done.  I got a rich glazed serving of foie atop rice and shredded lettuce.  Lettuce was a bit odd but I ate up everything because the sauce seeped into the rice.  In the end I was given a cup of hot roasted green tea.

No joke, total indulgence.  But totally worth it.  If I can get back here and not go bankrupt, it will be kushiage tofu and hamachi belly should they have it.  Ooooh-mami!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,4,3,5,ma4jZPDpKwGAIbpTMWcEKg

party of four. ordered so much. standouts to me were the wagyu filet with wasabi, juicy crispy chicken, and the snapper sashimi. real creative the way they do things here. love the homemade soy sauce and spicy sake oil condiment thing. 

enjoyed the pork cheek skewer, mushroom skewer, tomato skewer and the homemade tofu. 

butter scallop was super rich. i still prefer them raw but this was a good version. came bathed in butter. buddy drank the butter from the shell. it grossed out everyone at the restaurant and our waitress almost threw up. 

the only real miss was the normal steak that was kind of tough, and the jidori chicken thigh which seemed under seasoned. that sake oil + wasabi + soy sauce should go on everything. they use legit wasabi which makes a difference.

Most of the dishes came out warm almost cold.  Which means they  cooked them quickly but waitress' brought them out late.  It was busy but no excuse for serving cold food.  Enoki dish was the worst, kobe beef is a joke (should not be advertised as kobe beef).  Tofus were decent as was the hamachi and chicken.

Older waitress was arrogant and down right rude.  When asked what dishes were popular or best to order, she said ""all our dishes were the best""  Very helpful!  Also told her we did not receive one of our dishes.  She rudely insisted she brought it to us.  After arguing with her for about 10mins, she went to the back and finally brought our dish.  She eventually comped it as she probably knew she made a mistake.

So, if you like these things please come here to try the best. Their sake selection is good, too. And the roasted green tea after my meal was exceptional quality. So, why only 4/5 stars?

says it all. its one of those things you just don't want to know what it is or how its obtain, but is good.

* Yellowtail Carpaccio - Fresh, clean, and refreshing taste. Personally I think Ichiza's Yellowtail Tar Tar taste much better and cheaper as well.

* Enoki mushroom + Bacon - Bacon tends to be salty, but somehow Raku was able to take the saltyness out of the bacon so it doesn't overpower the enoki mushroom. Nicely executed item.

* Sawagani (Japanese River Crab) - This has a lot of wow factor when you first see it. The novelty quickly wears off when you eat them. Nothing really special about them in the taste department. The bigger crabs have less flavor than the smaller ones because all you get is shell on the big ones.

* Uni + Seaweed Miso Soup - The uni was incredibly fresh and has a surprising sweetness to them. The seaweed miso soup didn't overpower the taste of the uni. If they served this nigri style, it would taste even more awesome. 

* Kobe Beef + Wasabi - Good, but not the melt in your mouth taste I come to expect with Kobe beef. The wasabi was also very light tasting.

* Kobe Beef Liver - You think you're getting Kobe Beef for the first few bites, than when you're about to swallow you get the liver taste. A good item to get even to get even if you don't like liver.

* Lamb Chop - Perfectly cooked medium rare. Very tasty and just juicy. How can Wynn & Texas de Brazil fail so badly cooking lamb.

* Rice Balls - Miso flavored riceballs. $5 for 2. Nothing special and so not worth it.

* Drunken Garlic Clams - Fresh clams with a good broth. This is reminiscence of the equally tasting stuff at Naked Fish.

* Lava cake - Its a lava cake. Nothing really special from the other lava cakes I've tried before.

* Cinnamon + Chocolate Pudding - This is like milk with chocolate and cinnamon remnants. The waitress said to mix well and I did. A lighter chunky version of chocolate milk?

* Cheesecake - Cheesecake tends to be very heavy in cheese taste, but it was beaten so it tastes very light, but still taste the cheese. It makes you feel like you can eat this all day and not feel guilty about it. The lightness of the cheese works on this desert. 

The wait staff is very friendly, helpful, and attentive. Nothing more you can ask from the wait staff.

But service isn't perfect. When you're eating at Raku, expect to stay 1 hour at the minimum since food comes out very slow at first. But if you do order a lot of items, they come out one right after another. Reservations is absolutely required, I've been denied numerous times till I finally went during the middle of the week. 

Ladies, if a guy asks you where you want to eat, Ichiza or Raku and he's paying, say Raku and bash your eyelashes and smile at him. Guys, don't even mention Raku no matter what kind of cute looks she may give you, you're wallet will thank you!

Raku has good food, but you pay a steep price for the ambiance and each item that isn't really that special compared to Ichiza. Raku is a lot more consistent than Ichiza, but Ichiza has the advantage of being able to try multiple things when you be lucky to get 1 item at Raku.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,8,7,4,OprBOcckbKc6hRVR7rKVgQ

A gem in Las Vegas' Chinatown. This place was recommended to me by a server in LV SLS's Katsuya and I must admit he hit a home run on this one.

A small japanese bistro that was a little difficult to find that offers very fresh sashimi and robust yakitori options. Their specials board was also a delight to see as it had sashimi of some fish you don't see often in restaurants. Also noted was their condiments on the table, they offer items other than just your soy and low sodium soy which is a plus. 
(Try the spicy sake condiment, really good with raw fish AND grilled items)

Pros:
-Not your conventional Japanese restaurant, offers non conventional items
-Scallop dish was excellent
-Fresh fish from their basic sashimi platter
-Good yakitori. (Beef Tendon is a MUST if you're into gelatinous things)

Cons:
-Priced high. (party of 2 = $190 after tips)
-No prices on the special board. (always suspicious)
-NO BEEF TOUNGE YAKITORI (Big nono)

I don't see myself dining here everyday, however it is a great place to host your friends when they visit town when they're tired of the strip.",3gX0SnispHbO2QRdGipt0g,0,0,5,GSIUA00_ihJV6tcrPGOI5g

4701103,2016-06-09,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku is a Japanese charcoal grill restaurant owned by Mitsuo Endo, a Tokyo born chef trained in kaiseki cuisine. The restaurant uses charcoal imported from Japan. Endo has been awarded as a semifinalist for the James Beard Award Chef Southwest.

When you step foot into Raku, the aroma of the food being grilled is alluring. Raku's charcoal burns at a higher temperature than most other charcoals, creating a crispy finish while bringing out the flavor of the ingredients. 

The seating is quite comfortable. There is a bar where you can eat, watching the chefs cook as well as secluded tables where you can have some privacy. The women's bathroom is worth checking out: there is an aquarium taking up half of the wall! 

YELLOWTAIL CARPACCIO ($12.00): This was so good. The yellowtail was fresh and melt in your mouth good and the sauce that came with it was slightly smoky with a hint of spiciness. It's a good, light starter to begin your meal.  

ENOKI MUSHROOM WRAPPED WITH BACON ($3.00): The mushrooms were cooked nicely and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish. It was a nice bite with a great crisp texture from the mushroom. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  

KOBE BEEF OUTSIDE SKIRT WITH GARLIC ($7.50): The beef was cooked well to a nice medium. It was juicy and the marinade was delicious. The garlic chips on top of the beef added another level of flavor while giving it a crunch. A good dish overall.  

MY FAVORITE DISH. STEAMED FOIE GRAS EGG CUSTARD ($10.00): I absolutely loved this dish. My friend who resides in Tokyo was amazed at the flavor of this dish.  She was a bit taken back from the lack of ingredients from the usual steamed egg custard she's had in Tokyo. Regardless, we both agreed it was yummy. The foie gras was not overpowering and the custard was deliciously smooth. A must order! 

AGEDASHI TOFU (HALF-$7.50): The tofu at Raku is made in house and was delicious. The exterior of the tofu had a nice crunch while the tofu remained delicately soft. It was topped with salmon roe, which I could've done without.The broth complemented the tofu well.  

COLD GREEN TEA SOBA WITH POACHED EGG ($8.50): This dish was nothing special. The soba noodles tasted like any other soba noodles. I really couldn't taste the green tea that I was hoping. The poached egg was lovely but still, this dish wasn't spectacular.  

KUROBUTA PORK CHEEK ($4.25): This was one of my favorites and a must order. The pork cheek had so much flavor and was so nice and tender. It's kurobuta! How can you go wrong?  

IBERICO KUSHI (SPECIAL): This is also one of my favorites and probably my favorite out of all the grilled meats. The meat was tender and the sauce didn't overpower the taste of the meat.  

Overall, Raku was delicious. The service could've used a bit of work. We received one dish and waited about 30 minutes in between dishes until we said something about the food taking forever to be delivered to our table. It's truly authentic and my friend was able to speak Japanese to the staff. If you're in Vegas and want something a bit different than the usual Las Vegas Strip food, this is a good spot.

I visited on 04/11/2013 with my fiance Ruben and our cousin Daisy (visiting from the Bay Area). We were sat in a private dining area and it was so cool and intimate. I was really glad I made that reservation a couple months in advance!

We tried the Raku's Tofu: Housemade tofu that was super silky served with fresh grated ginger, green onions, and Katsuoboshi. Then topped with some of Raku's Soy Sauce (Japanese Daijingo soy sauce blended with Japanese plum). Simple and tasty. Also, the Agedashi Tofu: Their housemade tofu lightly fried and presented in a bowl of warm dashi broth and topped with green onions, Ikura, and nori. And for an extra kick, some hot chili paste placed on the rim of your bowl. Really, really great. I'm a big fan of tofu so I could be happy eating Raku's Tofu all night, but this Agedashi Tofu is a party of flavors in your mouth.

We also tried the Tempura Asparagus, Kanpachi sashimi (special), Blue Fin Tuna sashimi (special), Salmon with Ikura Oroshi, Enoki Mushroom Wrapped in Bacon, Direct-Flamed Eggplant (served with Katsuoboshi), Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Apple Marinated Lamb Chop, Grilled Rice Balls, Yellowtail with Glazed Soy-based Sauce, and Juicy Deep Fried Chicken. Their Yuzu Sake is really delicious.

My favorites were the tofu dishes, the sashimi specials, Enoki Mushroom with Bacon (this was SO good, we ordered it twice), and Apple Marinated Lamp Chop (we ordered two of these as well).

Our meal was spectacular. We had so much fun with all the dishes and the service was wonderful. There are so many selections and everything was, at the least exciting, and at the best, amazing.

For 2 people, the bill came out close to $300-- including warm sake, beers, and a variety of bite-sized meals. 

I really like the idea of having smaller bite-sized portions, it allows one to play with the flavors in their mouth. Rather than engulfing large portions of food, one can savor the moment/flavor and truly appreciate the work that was put into the meal. People derive satisfaction from food and place them into two categories-- how full they get and the flavor/experience of the food. If we're talking about an inverted/U-shape curve, I would be sitting right at the ""top"" of this curve-- not too full to feel disgusted with myself, but not too hungry where I didn't feel like the food was undervalued.

I am highly recommending this to anybody we know visiting Vegas.  Those of you who live in Las Vegas and can visit this place regularly, I am highly jealous.

The restaurant does not have a huge dining area, and I would highly recommend reservations on most nights (we could only get a late reservation on a Thursday night and had called a couple days in advance).

I would second the description I have read before that this place is like a Japanese Tapas bar.  We tried 8 or 9 dishes and shared them between the two of us.  We left satisfied, but not over stuffed.

This was the best meal we had in Vegas and the bill came to just over $100 with drinks.

My wife and I had things we each liked more than others, but that was largely due to personal preferences.  The one item I most highly recommend trying is the grilled Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce.

They have an extensive sake menu, and it was a little intimidating for someone who doesn't have much sake knowledge.  However, I explained this to our server and she helped me pick something out.

The restaurant is located in China Town, so if you are staying on the strip your best bet for getting there is to take a cab (unless you have a car, of course).  We were a little worried about how to find a cab at the end of our meal.  However, we asked the server if she could recommend a cab company, and she instead offered to call us one.

This was the Japanese experience I have been waiting for my whole life. Food makes us humans feel good, no doubt. But then there is food that makes you feel like you are sedated. This is also has to do with the type of food you like but anyway here goes...

Let's start with the sake sampler they serve. Three different cups filled with sake. One sweet, one smooth and one strong. All high quality tasting sakes. After that came Sapporo fresh from the tap. Oh Baby.

I thoroughly read through all of the yelp reviews for this restaurant before I went to make SURE I tried the best things on the menu. I brought a list with me of items that were raved about. Thank the Lord for Yelp. I would recommend ordering a bunch of things if it is your first time but if you want to know the dishes that stood out to me the most................

Blue Fin Sashimi - There is really not much to say other than this is the best tuna hands down. The texture, clean taste, just beautiful. I do like how the waitress instructed us how to flavor certain dishes and when not to do it all.

Raku's Tofu and Agedashi Tofu - They allow you to order half of each which I strongly recommend. Raku's tofu was like a slab of cream pie with the most delicate flavor. I liked the Agedashi a bit more because it came in a bowl of broth and was more soaked with flavors. Both are home made and unlike any other tofu I have ever tried. My dad hates tofu and he really enjoyed both tofu dishes.

**Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe - This was by far ranked the most unique/delicious dish I have ever eaten. They serve in a bowl where each item is placed in its own group. You are then instructed to stir it all together - like a soup. If you have issues with slimy food texture this may not be for you. The flavors were so pure and were put together by an angel of light. The saltiness of the roe, the odd sweet flavor of the sea urchin, the egginess of the egg, the crunchy earthiness of the vegetables. So many emotions during the eating of this dish. I will never forget this one.

Pork Cheek - Remember Gushers? This is like a bacon gusher. Heavens to betsy was this amazing. If you are not a fan of fatty things this may not be for you however for $3 a peice it is worth trying. Salty sweet flavor burst. Mm..

Kobe Beef Tendon - I am a tendon person to begin with - if you are not, still give it a try but get ready because it is very uniquely textured. For me, this was the ultimate tendon - crispy outside - congealed gelly like inside. The waitress was sure to tell us how good tendon is for your skin.

Salmon Belly - Think about the most tender butter like salmon you have ever had. Well that sucks compared to this dish. I don't know how else to describe it. The outside was grilled crispiness with salty flavor - the flesh was so naturally oil laden that it tasted like Salmon Butter if there ever was such a thing. *Sigh*..

Enoki Mushroom wrapped with Bacon - This dish was very simple but what a combination of flavors!! You simply must try this. The first thing that hits your tongue is the wonderful grilled bacon salty/sweet flavor and then CRUNCH you bite into the cluster of mushrooms and your mouth is filled with soft earthy flavors.

Ikura Don - I eat Ikura at least two times a week because I love it and it is super good for you. This dish was a bowl of the freshest Ikura (seriously they gave you a LOT of Ikura) served on white rice. They were adament on telling me that it does not need any seasoning. That is how beautiful and simple the flavors were here. 

Grilled Baby Corn with Spicy Mayo - dayyum this was the way grilled corn should taste. They serve the corn still wrapped in it's greens so you have to peel it to open fresh smokey grilled baby corn. Dip it in the spicy mayo and then you have got a crunchy delcious treat.


Some other things I tried was the Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Kobe Liver, Soy Glazed Foie Gras, Green Tea Creme Brulee, Lamb Chops, Chicken Thigh, Japanese Shishito Pepper.. I think that's it? The only thing I know I would not order again is the Pork Ear. The hard cartiledge inside kind of threw me off even though it all tasted good.

All of this food for a little over $200 really is not that bad when you take into consideration the quality and specialty you are getting.

The inside is small and cozy, the service is great, make sure you make reservations and it would be smart to order mostly everything at once if you can. THE BATHROOM IS AMAZING. IT IS THE MOST HIGH TECH TOILET EVER.

I have never written this long of a review on Yelp or was as excited about reviewing a place as I was with Raku. If you really want to experience some of the best food there is, GO HERE.",k53DY3AaG0rDghT6R6wnzg,6,8,5,wiJSPpx0B799dPRJfnK7bA

There were 10 of us all together and Raku advised they would do a prefix menu for a party this size ($50 per person), so that they can have some food prepared and that the food would flow better to each person, instead of waiting for each individual order to cook.  We did request some things to be included in the prefix menu, kobe beef skirt steak, duck, and the crunchy asparagus.  I gotta say this trip was better than last.  We had over 10 dishes each.  The pork cheeks and skirt steak were awesome, though I recommend dipping it in the sauce it comes with for extra flavor.  All in all, every dish that came out was good.  Still wish they had quail eggs wrapped in bacon.  =)",2Na5lgDJwN1dPyvLmKmWgg,0,0,4,eJVkWbhkpqrBUuUULchwTw
4731159,2014-07-28,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I came across Raku from Andrew Zimmern. I was watching a random Youtube video about Las Vegas eats, and Mr. Zimmern swears Raku as an anti-Vegas destination with some of the best Japanese food around. I immediately dropped everything and headed off the strip. Raku, located in a dismal looking strip mall in Las Vegas' very own Chinatown, concentrates on good quality Japanese cuisine. More of a Japanese ""tapas"" bar, most of their items are shared amongst the table. Most people associate Japanese cuisine with sushi. Chef and owner, Mitsuo Endo showcases a menu with Japanese cuisine as an all-inclusive whole. There is no sushi on the menu, though there is raw fish and sashimi. Everything is masterfully prepared and they use only the best ingredients.

We started things off with the uni soup. This was a simple dish that was so refreshing. The broth was soy sauce based and had a subtle seafood essence. Filled with seaweed and a few slivers of uni, it was an interesting soup. The uni was flavorful and mellow -- the warm soup made it more toned down and silky. I don't it that is a good thing, but it was delicious. This was a great start to an awesome late night eat.

We ordered the pork belly to feed the carnivore within. It wasn't necessarily special. The quality and bite of the pork belly was a lot better though. Most places will just put some thinly sliced pork belly on a stick, grill it and call it day. Raku's was thicker, and more meaty. All in all, it was a deliciously cooked yakitori -- no sauce needed.

Some of the best things I have ever eaten was Raku's Agedashi Tofu. It is probably the best tofu I ever had. Some sad days, I would be home alone. I'd open up a tub of tofu, microwave it, make some kind of soy sauce concoction, and pour it over the tofu. For what it was, it was tasty and I was happy. This agedashi tofu really changed my life. The tofu is made daily, in house. The fried exterior had a little crispiness with a hint of chewiness. Inside, it was completely different -- smooth and silky, and custard like. The broth in itself makes this dish so good. I don't know what was in it, but soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and dashi was definitely in the mix. There was a smudge of red pepper puree on the bowl for a bit of spice. Topped with ikira (salmon roe), scallions, and nori, the tofu dish was complex, yet perfectly balanced.

We ended things with one of my favorite chicken dishes of all time. The juicy deep fried chicken, as they call it, was exactly what the name suggests -- It was juicy. It was deep fried, and it's...chicken. The thigh meat is rolled up skin on, battered, and then fried. The roll is cut up into slices and then served on some vinaigrette dressed spinach. The vinaigrette on the spinach helped with the fatty chicken. As the picture shows, the chicken is a bit pink in the center -- might be a little alarming for sensitive types. For me though, the chicken was so juicy and flavorful -- probably achieved from this near ""medium well"" cooking. It was an exceptional dish in both flavor and texture.

If you want to eat at Raku, make reservations. I was given the stink eye when I walked in and said I didn't have reservations. Luckily, I was seated within 10 minutes as long as we ate ""quickly."" Most likely, that won't happen to you unless you make a reservation for this small 48 seater restaurant. I was very impressed with the food at Raku. The ingredients are of the highest quality and simply prepared. Even the water is treated with respect, filtered with a giant charcoal log. Details like this, with a passion for perfection makes Raku very special. It's not just some Japanese restaurant off the strip. It's possibly one of the best in the country.",m33gSTi0Fyo3W2Qw6WVdtA,4,1,5,U-PDYJn7s3AeJURvpt5Pww
4732036,2010-12-29,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"We had an amazing meal here on wednesday night.   It was my second time here.  The first time was before they did the renovation.   It's a lot bigger now (yay!) 
We started off with a bottle of demon slayer one of my favorite sakes.   
We ordered a bunch of stuff off the specials board.  The portion sizes are great.  The sashimi special came with about 8 pieces of regular pieces and 3 or four smaller thinner pieces.  The shima aji sashimi, so delicious and melted in my mouth!  I will go back just for the shima aji...sooo good. 
The kobe beef tataki, amazing!  Tender and flavorful.  Came with about 10 pieces of beef.    
We also got the braised pork belly which makes my mouth water just thinking about it right now! It came with 4 pieces of pork belly with a sauce drizzled on top in a broth with some greens.   The last thing we got off the specials board was the ayu kanroni.  Hmm...we got it because it sounded interesting, but it wasn't our favorite. It was a whole marinated sweet fish that was cold.  It wasn't bad, just different, I think I was expecting a hot dish.    
We got the poached egg with sea urchin which is a visually stunning dish and tasty as well.  From the grill we got shishito peppers and chicken breast with skin.  Both tasty as well.  Unfortunately they were out of the corn stuffed with potato.  For dessert we ordered green tea creme brulee and green tea ice cream.  We didn't realize the creme brulee already comes with a scoop of ice cream. But both were sooo good!  
So an amazing dinner for 2 with a big bottle of sake and dessert came out to $140.  What a great deal!

4745314,2012-05-09,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I was tempted to give Raku 3.5 because it was uneven (and overrated, though in a different way from Lotus of Siam, which I also reviewed). 

Essentially, at a place like this, it is in your best interest to order mostly, if not exclusively, from the daily specials board. Some of the regular stuff is frankly not that great, and it's not in your interest to spend too much time figuring out what's what.

That said, I broke my cardinal rule and ordered too heavily from the regular menu. The kobe beef liver sashimi was terrific. There is a pretty obvious potential danger to serving raw offal. I had no concern here. At the counter guy's recommendation I also ordered some pork cheek (fine) and grilled tomato (not objectionable, but certainly not much better).

But then, the specials menu was uneven, too. The homemade tofu was fine, but the portion size was confusing. My countermate confirmed my suspicion that better varieties of this dish can be had.

HOWEVER. The reason I decided to give four stars is the quality and taste of a squid special. Half sashimi and half lightly grilled. A small raw bird's egg (quail?) wrapped in raw squid ""noodles"" was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. It was simultaneously very rich and very light. It really could not have been better.

If I went back, I would order the entire specials menu regardless of the resulting ""balance"" of my meal (in respect of proteins, vegetables, etc). I think that this approach would yield some very memorable meals, as well as some merely very good meals.",70JHliVId4FzY2_29gocHw,1,2,4,9-CYC2ZhsiKM-myXSVm_nQ

I came in as a walk in, without an understanding of the restaurant's theme and style of dining. There were tables and bar seats open, but the hostess insisted they were not ready yet, and that all the tables were reserved for the evening.  I got upset after ten minutes of waiting before being seated. Turns out we would be here for 2+ hours without much regret. Except the beef liver. That dish tasted like regret.  The length of our stay made it easier to understand why the hostess had to hold onto the reserved tables and seats, and didn't want to cave to an ignorant walk-in.

The menu is Japanese styled Tapas. The dishes are priced well.  My favorites include the Toro (creamy texture), the beef grilled dishes, grilled duck, bacon covered mushroom, the pork cheek, and the cold tofu.  The provided table salt and soy sauce were perfect compliments to bring the flavor out of the house-made tofu.  I didn't care for the chives and wasabi it came with.  My absolute favorite was the cold noodles with custard.  The broth and custard were simply amazing.  I was full, but still shoo'd the waitress away so I could spoon the remnants of the custard from the bowl.  

The beef liver was liver.  The grilled fish was nothing special, but we got the fried version as well which came in the Agedashi preparation (very tasty).  

The service was close to the level you'd expect at a higher-end steakhouse.  The waitress knew her stuff and was spot-on with recommendations.  Our dishes were cleared quickly, though the food was a bit slow to come out, also like a higher-end steakhouse.

That option changes from time to time due to their specials for the day. 

Our first course was a half of homemade tofu. The texture of the tofu was quite firm and it just soaks up the soy sauce when you add. The sashimi plate was my favorite. Fresh and it just melts in your mouth. Not to mention the fresh wasabi paired very well with it all. We also got deep fried asparagus with rice cracker, fish soup, beef kabob, pork kabob, and fish egg on rice.

Some of the items that we ordered were amazing like Kobe beef filet and the Foie gras, yellowtail sashimi and the sashimi salad. But, the rest of it was mediocre and were very small portions. 
Also, and here is the big bummer.....
We were seated in an awesome private room for 4 which at first seemed like a quaint incredible setting. But, it was insanely hot in there and I was told by two different people that there was no way to increase the air. Our waitress was sort of rude about it too. She did not offer to move us nor did she offer any type of solution. We felt like we were sitting in a sauna the entire night which kind of ruined the entire experience for us. Also, we ordered one item off of their specials list. It was a type of bluefin toro. It was extraordinarily fishy and none of us could eat it. We politely told the waitress that we did not like it because it was too fishy and she said that there was nothing she could do about it. So, I think for these prices and their small portion size this restaurant needs to step up it's game in terms of air-conditioning, food and service.

Like my friend Heinz says, ""I'll bet on Raku anytime against any Japanese restaurant in the United States...  that's how AWESOME Raku is!"" Heinz introduced me and now every trip I go there I have to eat there. The best part is that it's open LATE!

Rumor has it, Chef's from the Restaurants on the Strip go here to eat afterwards, and they were even offered to open up in one of the Casinos but the owner preferred off-strip and turned down the offer.

Here are my Recommendations:
- Make reservations or you will be salivating in line
- Beef Tendon: These are the best Beef Tendons ever. Not only do they melt in your mouth but they have the grill taste infused. We order 8 typically. Yes I'm serious, that good!
- Pork Cheeks: Sounds bad Tastes AWESOME
- Bacon Wrapped tomatoes: It's wrapped in bacon need i say more?
- Juicy deep fried chicken: Asian like me and like dark meat? This one is for you. Don't get bamboozled with the Chicken breast w/ Wrapped skin. Fried Chicken better
- Agadashi Tofu: Homemade tofu good/healthy
- Fresh Homemade Tofu in hot broth: Like the 1st but BETTER because fried and in soup broth.
- Yellow Tail Carpaccio: Good fresh!
- Specials: Flown in Tuna from Japan - If they have this GET it, it's better than Toro.
- Bathroom: you got to use it, feels like you step into a tranquil garden with birds chirping and fake flowers but real rose petals on the floor. Remember ""Coming to America"" and rose petals?  You will see...

I'm making myself Hungry for it now.... I never go to Vegas and not visit Raku, it's that good. Time to take another Vegas trip!

They're really busy from when they open at 6 pm to 11 pm -- so if you want to chat with the chef or staff, come late. Read Heinz's post if you want more elegant descriptions.",v8jCrcHGoB4zUEVPiqjG-g,7,2,5,srgrWcu4JZVq4pNwqxueLQ

Since I had avidly looked at their online menu [with pictures!! yay], I knew what I really wanted to try.  

The Food

Seafood with Bonito Guts Pickled in Salt - I was really excited to try this.  I knew it had uni and if you know me, you know I LOVE uni, but also because I love guts.  In addtion, it also had ikura.  The Bonito Guts were definitely pickled in salt.  The texture was crunchy and tasted salty, which complimented the milder flavors, in comparison, of the uni and ikura.  The saltiness helped to bring out the sweetness of the uni and intensified the taste of the ikura.

Fresh Kobe Beef Liver
Another dish I was excited to try.  After watching Andrew Zimmern in Africa eating raw camel liver, my boyfriend and I thought it looked really tasty.  A bit macabre aren't we?  Anyways, this dish arrived looking like little piles of dark ketchup with a slice of garlic on top.  There was some oil mixture to dip the liver in.  If you ever eaten cooked liver, raw liver tastes almost the same except the texture is crunchy, creamy, and possesses a VERY intense liver flavor.  I really liked the pairing of the garlic with the liver.  Though the dish was an interesting experience, I'm not going to be craving it like I did the previous dish.

Special of the Day: Agedashi Tofu served two ways [fresh and fried]

Served cold, the fresh tofu had a pretty delicate and mild flavor.  It was accompanied by some bonito shavings, green onions, and shredded ginger.  It was recommended to eat it with their special house blended soy sauce.  Again, this dish was really mild, a contrast to the first dish of pickled bonito guts.  I liked it and it served to really highlight the flavor of tofu.

When the tofu was fried, it arrived in a shallow bowl some brown broth-like sauce and little mushrooms floating around.  The tofu also had some ikura, seaweed, and green onions topping it.  This dish was served warm.  Since the fried tofu was the same tofu as the cold one [they just cut the tofu in half and served it two ways for us], the flavor was pretty much the same but because it was fried and served warm, it felt more soothing to me because it was a cold night.

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe
Boy, was this a slimy dish.  I have no qualms with sliminess but I can see how others may be turned off from this dish.  The dish contained a poached egg, some soy sauce like broth, ikura, uni, sliced okra, little mushrooms, Japanese mountain yam [which if you don't know already, it super slimy and can be mashed/grated to a natto consistency] and some seasoning sprinkled on.  This was a cold dish.  Basically, a nice mix of flavors.  Though it contained many elements that I love, this wasn't a dish I loved.  It was okay overall.

Steamed Egg Custard with Foie Gras
To die for.  This was the BEST egg custard I have ever had.  Probably contained Lord knows how many calories because it was so rich, creamy, and decadent.  It was a really nice, warm, savory dish.  

Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin
This was pretty average.  Nothing much to write home about.

This is definitely a nice place to go to, especially for a date imo because of the dim lighting and close seating arrangements.  Next time I go to Vegas, if not for the Steam Egg Custard with Foie Gras, I'll definitely come back to try other dishes.",V4ycivTeJK-k7cuLaDCdeA,1,2,4,pXLI4x7zgT7g5VC_IvyP5A

They actually warm their sake the old-fashioned way.  It stayed hot practically the entire time it was in the little pot-bellied jug at our table.  We didn't understand what the hell was taking so long, but when it was explained why, we piped the hell down.

Again, because 15 courses is, again, way too much food for anyone, they have a lovely bidet in one of their restrooms.  In that same restroom, it is aquarium, themed, as if you are underwater.  They also HAVE an aquarium nestled into the wall opposite the booty-wash.

We went to dinner at a place called Raku. Now seriously. I don't say this much but there are two real Japanese Restaurants in this city. Ichiza and Raku. It was Errol's first time and I wanted him to share the experience and passion that I feel for the industry. 
Raku is a small place in a strip mall next to Ozzy's Bar and Lounge or somethin like that. It's hidden behind a building and it's front is covered with a giant cloth that makes it look like a tent. But inside is a restaurant that rivals anything put out on the strip. 
He sat and told me this was exactly the type of restaurant he wanted to open. I knew that and marveled at the fact that I would give him this everlasting experience. Raku houses about 8 or 9 tables and averages 60-100 covers a day. The decor inside is simple, modern and minimalistic. We started out with a sake flight of a nice Junmai, then an unpasturized sake, finally a Nigori. We ordered a lot from the menu. Agadashi Tofu....Homemade tofu in rich brown broth with seaweed green onions, ikura(Salmon Roe), and other things I probably don't know. We ordered the special blue fin tuna. It was so succulent and melted in your mouth with fresh wasabi. WHO HAS FRESH WASABI??? So hard to find. We ended up ordering two. Kurobata pork cheek skewers, lamb chops, two skewers of Kobe beef outside skirt with fried garlic. All were amazingly cooked to perfection. Simple and clean. Bamboo shoots. Fresh bamboo...grilled over open coals and it tasted like the sweetest corn you have ever tasted. Finally Foie gras. Now normally I don't eat foie due to force feeding geese, however the French have passed a law to have them naturally feed. So I didn't mind so much. The foie was skewered and cooked so well it was caramelized in color. We sat and tried to figure out the ingredients it was ridiculous. The chef/owner was Enzo-San and he showed us a lot of his little secrets. Errol literally said it's one of the best meals he has ever had. 
I think we came to the conclusion of our passion. The passion for the art of food and drink. We both realize we're not trying to be rich. Even though we have the means to do so. I think we both enjoy the art. I want you to come to me and say. Make me a drink that will blow me away. Not just make me a Red bull vodka.  I don't want to make that. I don't wanna make a Jack and Coke, or Midori Sour. I wanna blow your fuckin mind. I wanna make you cocktail on the fly with fresh ingredients that just make you say ""Damn."" I want that in my restaurant. Five cocktails. Different every day. If you see me and stop and say, ""Make me somethin special."" I wanna be stumped and say ""yes,"" I wanna work hard and take 10 minutes to absorb your essence and make a cocktail especially for you. Just like Errol he wants to just cook for you. Not off the menu. Just something to blow your mind and have creative freedom.
That's the customers I want. We both agreed if we were completely wealthy and didn't need to work. We would still do this just to challenge ourselves and strive to be the best.
We talked about Epicurean. Now he's inspired to do food related to what we ate. Not to mimic...but to pay homage to the traditional way and add a molecular twist.
I'm still doing my 3 cocktails...but I'm still inspired to do one more in a molecular sense with no glass - maybe a cocktail hors devours. Today I talked to one of my best friends Davey Diaz from KLUC and DJ Donny to help me with lighting. Yes I'm gonna light up our motherfuckin restaurant. If Hefner decided to give us the big booth. I'm gonna blow your senses out of the water. So now I'm ready, and I realize how much love I have for my craft. It took me years to figure that out.

Parking in the private lot can be tight, although street parking should be a possibility. Staff was friendly throughout the meal and went over the daily specials.

Started off with the miso soup which was surprisingly quite salty. The tofu was soft and tender though.

The amuse bouche was decent and was made using fresh fish.

Moved on to the skewers which started off with the pork cheek that Yelpers were raving about. This was very tender and flavorful. 

Moved on to the Kobe Filet which was also very good. I did enjoy the kick from the Wasabi on top.

The beef tendon skewer was very tender and flavorful and the grilled foie gras was perfectly grilled with an amazing sauce!

Ended off the meal with the green tea creme brulee which was excellent!

4842383,2014-10-21,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I would come to Vegas just for Raku. In fact I'm so glad I found it on my first trip to Vegas last year, that this place gives me a reason to keep coming back, to Las Vegas that is. Ok, I exaggerate, but I go out of my way to find myself here while I'm in town even with all of the competition on the strip.

One of the key elements here is the ambiance and atmosphere, the holistic experience. From the design elements, to the dishware to the food itself. I have never enjoyed robata grill food before, and am so glad I'm now aware of this preparation. The robata grill dishes are definitely tapas-sized. All are reasonably priced for the quality (and taste of course) and enable picking a handful without getting too full. Each dish has remnants of the grill charcoal flavor.

Here's the robata grill items I loved: tomato bacon, eringe mushroom, enoki mushroom bacon, kobe beef with wasabi, duck in balsamic. The Jidori chicken was good, but no better than ""regular"" chicken. Jidori chicken is Japanese for ""from the ground"" and translates to essentially to free-range, organic. The kurobuta pork cheek is excellent with the pepper sake sauce. The scallops were very good and served in a powerful red sauce.

Do not leave here without trying the Raku tofu. This is real tofu, creamy almost like burrata, versus the gelatine or stiff stuff we find in American supermarkets. Spring for the full size, you'll end up ordering a second half portion. The Agadashi tofu is also excellent.

I wasn't a huge fan of the rice ball in broth with ume plum. The broth was delicious, along with the seaweed, but the rice ball wasn't what I expected and the ume plum added an unfavorable flavor. I confess that was my first time exposing my palette to umeboshi, and I imagine it was an excellent preparation that I'm not yet ready for.

Make sure to call for reservations if you definitely want a spot. I remember first time around, we got a bit of brush off and they don't care for picking up the phone, but in the end it was well worth it. If you don't eat Japenese cuisine frequently, I also strongly recommend you study the menu and google words in advance of getting there. While the servers are generally happy to answer questions, it's awkward to ask what every Japanese word means and keep all of it in mind when ordering.

Worth mentioning that on the tables they have custom condiments; homemade blend of plum soy sauce, green tea sea salt, chili pepper infused sake, and a blend of chilli peppers. All very delicious. They also had a board of special dishes and fishes. Our neighbors ordered one of the fish and it looked very good. 

We got there around 6:15pm on a Monday night without reservations, and were told a table is available until 8pm. I wasn't really fazed. They were really quick to bring out all of our dozen dishes, even second orders and we were done by 7:30pm, without really rushing. Don't be surprised, or put off, to be told something like this without a reservation. Also, hold off on the dessert at Raku and instead save room for whimsical Sweets Raku offerings a couple doors down.",dYJPAlkQx_K7WVfbg3aj7A,1,2,5,2N0cmfGe3nLBLbWgZLLMkw

Raku is actually just a few doors down from Monta Noodle House, where I had eaten for lunch just earlier...so it was a familiar scene. 

We didn't go until 11 at night, and about half an hour after we were seated, more and more people kept coming through the doors and getting seated.. This place is definitely a late night spot for many...and it wasn't even party kids or anything, several were much older guests.  Good food is good food, I guess, regardless of age.  

Well, onto our meal...we were definitely not disappointed.  Had a tofu dish, i forget what it's called, the foie-gras with egg-custard(which was okay, I'd rather have the foie-gras ), Custard with scallop,  and the kobe beef tendon, bacon-wrapped tomato, chicken thigh, and a few other things I can't remember, but almost everything was good.  The Kobe tendon was actually pretty good, but the size of the tendon on the skewer plus the texture might not be appealing to many.  I liked it tho.  Meal for about 4 people only cost us $70 total, so it wasn't bad at all.   But seeing the various items on the menu, this place can get costly, but it would be just like if you were ordering various pieces of sushi from a sushi bar.  You get what you pay for.

Our server was very helpful in recommending various items and we were satisfied without overstuffing our selves.

The pricing for everything is very good and everything tasted delicious! 
We asked to see the specials of the day but those didn't show prices unless you ask for them. 
A lot of the menu had foie in it (yum!!). They also serve one type of dish at a time and wait for you to finish before bringing the next item. We got almost 2-4 of everything and it worked out well. 
My favorites were the raku tofu, foie egg custard, and Kobe liver tartare. The flavors on those dishes were WOW. The liver was fresh and melt in your mouth and is topped with raw garlic slices. The tofu was very silky and they gave specific instructions on how to eat and what to pair with it. The egg custard has got to be one of the best of tasted. It has foie on the top and a lot of the flavor mixed in.
Some of the other dishes we got were okra, eggplant, pork, tendon, scallop, salmon, foie, and foie bowl. Everything was seasoned properly maybe except for the eggplant (too much ginger). 
Their pitchers of beer carry around 6-8 glasses, which is very good for the price. 
The service was also excellent. Our waters were constantly being refilled and plates taken away or replaced.

Nearly all the seafood we tried had very strong fishy taste which made it nearly impossible to eat, even though our entire party are avid seafood/sushi eaters.  The course meal was 100 per person. The cost was not a big deal, however, due to the poor experience, I felt it was a huge waste of money.  Honestly, the best part of our meal was the fried asparagus, dessert, and wine.

4884732,2010-09-17,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku is one of the most unique restaurants you will find in Las Vegas.  The location is in a small strip-mall in Chinatown, an area west of the strip that has become a sort of hotspot for favorite restaurants of local foodies.  Not only is Raku in a very small strip-mall, but it's located in the very back corner of the strip-mall, barely visible from the road.  The restaurant is very small, maybe 15 tables at most, and is usually very crowded, so make sure to make reservations.  

While I have had one very bad experience here due to the service, I am too loyal to great food to hate this restaurant.  I also have had too many great experiences here to let bad service ruin it for me.  But nonetheless, this should be an example of how good the food is here.  It is what brought me back after that bad experience, and I am glad it did.  

The food at Raku is amazing, that's the best way I can put it.  The menu mostly consists of different skewers of meats, seafood, and vegetables.  All of them are made with the highest quality ingredients, and simply grilled over Japanese charcoal grills.  It won't sound fancy, but the flavors are so profound and so noticeable that you will appreciate their simplicity.  I have dined at Raku around 10 times now, and have compiled a list of my favorite dishes to get here.  
-Yellowtail Carpaccio: Thin slices of raw yellowtail, much like sashimi.  My favorite yellowtail comes from Ichiza, but every time I come to Raku, I question if this is my favorite.  Either way, it will be some of the best Yellowtail you have ever had, so definitely try it.  
-Duck w/ Balsamic Soy
-Foie Gras: some of the best Foie Gras I've ever had, and that's saying a lot.  
-Kobe Outside Skirt w/ Garlic: Toasted garlic on top of the very flavorful skirt steak.  
-Kobe Beef Filet w/ wasabi: One of the best things on the menu.  Fresh wasabi grated on top of the very tender, flavorful Filet.  Get this!
-Kurobuta Pork Cheek: Some of the best pork you will eat.  The small layers of fat are caramelized perfectly on the grill, creating a lot of great flavor in the meat. 
-Lamb Chop
-Yellowtail: simply grilled yellowtail that is very tender, and perfectly cooked.  Fish of this quality needs no sauce as it melts in your mouth.  
-Salmon: just like the yellowtail, melts in your mouth.  
-Chicken breast wrapped in skin: chicken that is wrapped in its own skin and grilled until the skin is crispy.  
-Juicy, deep-fried chicken
-Chicken Thigh

There are many other great items, but these are the staple items that I think are a must.  The only problem with Raku is that it can get very expensive.  The portions of each skewer are not very large, and you will need several to get full.  The prices are anywhere from $2 for each chicken thigh skewer to $14 for the Foie Gras.  So when you get a lot of these skewers, it can add up.  I usually come to Raku for a special occasion, or a time that I am expecting to spend around $50-$75/ person.  And to be honest, it could easily end up being $100/ person if you want sake, and they have a very good selection of sake.  

Do not bring your own wine in, as they do not allow it, and are very stubborn about not allowing it, as well.  Their wine list is terrible, yet for some reason they refuse to have a corkage fee.  When we went in one time, they tried to tell us it was illegal, which was clearly a lie because I've brought wine into many restaurants around Las Vegas, including other places in Chinatown.  But just know ahead of time to either drink sake, or drink bad wine.  They definitely won't let you bring your own.  

The service can be very good or very bad.  As is the case with many asian restaurants, the service is not very good unless you are asian or a regular.  I've had bad service here, and I've had pretty good service here, but service doesn't matter too much as long as I can get my Foie Gras!  

And much like most of the other best restaurants in Chinatown, Raku is open very late, until 2 am I believe.  So ""it's getting late"" isn't an excuse not to go here.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,5,2,5,N4SYICP-FMWVQwJ6bbfrkQ

Service: Depending upon the server, some servers are bit snobby which I did not care for at all. Sometimes I get lucky and get the better service. Also, I don't like the fact that they give you time limit. This is not ayce!!!I understand they are very busy and need their tables  turnover but I just not a fan. I went few days ago, I think the server told us it's time for our last call after 1.5 hours or earlier. Those are the reasons I didn't give 5 stars. 

Food: I love their food. Five star on their food. Here are some of my favorite:

1. Uni with mountain potato, poached egg and salmon roe. I love love love this dish. For some reason, the combination of those items together along with the sauce in there makes this dish so heavenly. 

2. Raku homemade tofu: If you like tofu, then you would love their homemade tofu. I like to eat it with their green tea sea salt along with all the condiments that comes with it. 

3. Hamachi Kama: They have the best hamachi kama in town. They are like 3 times bigger than the regular hamachi kama you order in other places but also 3 times the price. It's around 45 dollars. I think it's worth it, if you have party of three at least. Otherwise it might be too big for two people. 

4. Pork cheek yakitori: I normally don't like pork but their pork cheeks are so juicy and yummy! 

5, Juicy Fried chicken: One of my favorite fried chicken. They rolled up the chicken thigh and fried it. Yum yum yum! 

6. Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic/ Kobe beef fillet fresh wasabi: I like both of these. They are both very tender and juicy. 

These are my must ordered items every time. As far as for their sashimi, I think they are pretty good for the most part. I had the not so fresh sashimi before though.

I had called weeks prior to the date of arrival trying to get a reservation.  Unfortunately, no one picked up my three phone call attempts on various days.  That was very disappointing.  

On Saturday night, the GF and I decided to come here in hopes of scoring a table without reservations.  We were greeted by the hostess, and she said we would be able to sit at the bar in about ten minutes.  Five minutes pass and we ask her if we would be able to get a table instead.  She says no, and that they are booked for the night.  Then, a couple minutes later, she tells us someone who made reservations did not show up!  

The menu is one page, front and back, with lots of options that will make your mouth water.  We decided on the infamous Rakus Tofu, juicy deep fried chicken, crispy asparagus okaki, corn potato, butter sauted scallop, foie gras don, soboro don, and the waygu beef sashimi.  

The tofu was no joke.  It was the freshest I have ever eaten.  The ingredients used to pair  with the tofu complimented each other perfectly.  Make sure to try the green tea salt because that is what the chef recommended first.  Out of all the dishes, the plating on this one was the most creative.  The asparagus came next, accompanied by the corn potato.   The asparagus coated in the tempura batter was mind blowing.  The outside was so crunchy, and was a pleasant surprise.  The corn potato was my favorite dish.  Never could a dish be so simple, yet so elegantly presented.  I do not know how they did it, but hats off to them.  

Next up was the waygu beef sashimi, buttered scallop, andthe fried chicken.  The waygu slices were ultra thin, and such top tier cuts.  I practically ate the whole thing, and still wanted more!  The scallop was served on its shell, and the light sauce drizzled on top was very good.  The scallop itself was a tad bit chewy, and there were two hard mystery pieces that needed to be spat out.  The juicy, fried chicken was very good.  Although I wished it had been more crispy, it was definitely juicy.  I would have enjoyed it more had there been no chewy tendons in some bites.  

The foie gras don and soboro don came out last.  The foie gras was everything one could hope for, and so much more.  The buttery duck was well worth the wait.  The sauce that went with it was so good.  The soboro don was just okay.  I could have done without the pickled mustard, and there was no sauce to go with the dish.

4929631,2008-12-18,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Raku is great.  There are some fantastic dishes, like their housemade tofu, their agedashi tofu (often run as a special, but pretty much has become a daily offering), the pork cheeks, the green tea soba, and their soy sauce!  (I think I heard once that they make it themselves?)  The only menu item I stay away from is the pickles-- I normally LOVE oshinko, but I don't really like the pickles at Raku because they're bland.

There are only a couple drawbacks.  First, the speed at which you get your food can be inconsistent.  Last time I was there, we had to wait a good 45 minutes before we saw any food.  Some times the food comes out very slowly, other times it's ok.  Don't eat here if you're in a hurry-- we usually take a couple of hours for a meal.

Second, this is not a place I would be able to eat very often simply because much of the food is very salty and fatty.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE salty and fatty, but a little goes a long way and it gets overwhelming at times.  For this reason, I don't eat here more than once a month.

Third, some of the grilled items are cooked inconsistently.  The first time I ate at Raku I was BLOWN away by the beef tendon, which was very fatty and slightly gelatinous, but grilled and charred (so it was crispy and slightly bitter), and served with a sweet sauce.  DELICIOUS.  I've since ordered it several times, and it's never the same.  The last time I ate their (a few days ago), I swear it didn't go anywhere near a grill, so it was just pure fat and it was gross.

Nonetheless, this place is still one of my favorite restaurants I enjoy regularly!  Very popular for locals in the restaurant biz.",cY3wU46PVn9ZxUV42TyDXA,1,1,4,EgCVAHtdP_FdDyEUhsKMDg

4934709,2011-10-14,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I have only two words to share with you in this first sentence and that is - Robotayaki and Reservations. The two ""R""s.....

This is a Robotayaki style restaurant more than a sushi restaurant, so please understand that first.  If you do, then you will have an awesome time.

You can google robotayaki style, it is essentially grilled meats, fish, vegetables and etc.  If you have had yakitori, or gyoza, it is this type of food x 10!!!

1  Parking - No problem,  you are in a strip mall near the northwest corner of Decatur and Flamingo.

2.  Ambiance - Outside, odd, as the strip mall seems, well , just out of place.  Inside, what a jewel, small, intimate and classy in a Japanese ""inn"" type of style. I would say traditional.

3.  Bathrooms - Please come here with a full bladder. I normally do not review bathrooms, but both of them are really cool.  One has a fishtank and bidet type japanese autobot toilet seat, and the other has a zen like tree setting. Very cool and different than your normal tiled utilitarian restrooms.

4.  Food - Wow, as a fan of Robotayaki in San Francisco and in Tokyo, I was happy to find another robotayaki here in Vegas and one that is really awesome!  I cannot recall all the names of the food on the menu, but you can know that you will be ordering meat, fish, vegetables, tofu, soups and noodles that are exquisitely flavored and all of it is edible, tasty and not outside the comfort zone if you are not into eating everything and anything.



5.  Service - The service is outstanding. i was with guests and also one person from Paris, the server took the time to explain everything, to give us ideas when confused or not sure about which to order, and even told us when she felt we had enough to start. It was a great experience.

This is a wonderful place, and I would recommend you make RESERVATIONS.  You call, they tell you when to eat, you show up, and you enjoy.

4939662,2012-04-29,3,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I have heard that they have started a kaiseki course, so I have been curious and wanting to try it out, but given that my last experience here was merely A-OK, I have dragged my feet until recently, but here are my thoughts after trying it out.  

First of all, Kaiseki literally means ""stone in the bosom"".  This originates from Zen buddhist monks keeping a warmed stone in the bosom to endure cold and hunger during their training as they were not allowed to eat much in the afternoon.  Occasionally they are allowed to eat small portions of rice poridge, and such small meals originated the name ""kaiseki"", as something to wade off hunger.

Kaiseki then transformed to offerings during formal tea ceremonies, and then after hundreds of years it has evolved  into what we consider kaiseki ryori now, which is a multi course formal dinner offered almost eclusively in ryoutei,  As it inherits a spirit of the tea ceremony, the focus is on service and offering the best that can be offered at the time to serve the customer, the spirit of ""ichigo ichie"".  

As I consider Raku as sort of a high-end Izakaya like place, and certainly NOT a ryoutei, I was curious as to how they can pull off a kaiseki course, but here is how it went.  I had to make the reservation at least 3 days in advance, and the choices were 10 or 15-course dinner, and I was told to expect it to take at least 3 hours.  As I had to arrange for a baby sitter, I just went for a 10 course meal.

In Japan, ryoutei or high-end Japanese restaurant (something like Kiccho comes to mind) serves their guests in private tatami rooms, which isn't quite possible here, but at least they led us to a private room-like space toward the back of the restaurant, which is nice.  It was walled off except for the entrance part, so it is a bit more than a booth to give us some privacy.

We ordered some bottled water from Japan as well as a small bottle of sake as my wife and I don't drink that much, and the course started with yuzu flavored sake aperitif and then:
1) hotaruika (firefly squid) sumiso-ae
2) large plate with asparagus okaki, salmon with egg yolk, corn/potato, grilled egg plant, grilled duck, yamaimo mousse, and fois gras egg custard.  
3) squid and ikura with uni sauce
4) soup with chicken tsukune and cherry blossom leaf
5) sashimi of hatsu-gatsuo (early season bonito) and sayori (Japanese half beak)
6) miso glazed grilled huedai (star snapper)
7) fried aji (japanese jack mackerel) in dashi with eringi mushrooms
8) baby abalone
9) kobe beef steak on hot stone
10) shima aji namerou with rice and takana (striped jack tartar).
11) desert of fresh cheese mousse 

Whew!!  It sounds like a lot, and it IS a lot, but that took us more than 3 hours.  Was it good?  Yes.  Am I thrilled to go back and try it again?  No.  

Perhaps that is the reason why I live here and despite all the raves I hear and read about Raku, this was my second visit.  

I just think that it was a strech (to say it nicely) to call it kaiseki.  There are a few things that bothered me and distracted from the meal.  

There was a group of young kids wearing baseball caps, with baggy shorts and wife beaters talking very loudly, dropping F-bombs left and right who were sitting relatively close to us.  Although we were in a semi-private booth-like space, this was distracting.  Do I blame them?  No, because as I said before, I consider Raku to be a high-end Izakaya, and not a ryotei.  However, this is not quite the setting that I find appropriate to serve Kaiseki, which has Zen buddhism and tea ceremony in origin.  It has to be in a serene, zen-like space, and Raku is not it.

In any Kaiseki, there must be a balance of food from sea/land/mountain.  As you can see on the menu, 7 out of the 10 ingredients are seafood and the balance is hopelessly lacking.

One of the very important aspects of serving kaiseki food is ""Ma"" or spacing.  3 and a half hours for this meal?  My wife and I felt that this meal dragged way, way too long, and the consideration for MA was absolutely lacking.

One other concern was that my wife has a food allergy to shrimps/clams.  I was actually surprised that they didn't ask me that when I made the reservation and I forgot to mention it, but when I mentioned it at dinner, I was told that ""oh, we don't do kaiseki for people with allergies""....I told them that's OK, as I will be happy to eat her shrimps and clams, and the only thing that she couldn't eat happened to be abalone, no big deal.  However, this strays so so far away from the spirit of kaiseki which should inherit the spirit of ""ichigo-ichie"", which is at the heart of sadou, or tea ceremony as well a zen buddhism.  

In summary, I have a very difficult time calling this meal ""kaiseki"".  The food was good although not exactly ""great"" either, and kaiseki is not only about the food, but more importantly the experience, and as a whole, the experience was lacking and it was not something that I am yearning to go back for more.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,12,2,3,OHPkRpK8KSDUV1ATpojSdw

The restaurant itself is low lit in the second room. If you want it to be a silver bit more bright, request the bar or table seating in the front. 

Each table comes with information cards explaining the homemade soy sauce and salts.  I was a bit bummed that the one on my table was missing that evening but that's forgivable since I was easily able to grab the empty table's set to read. 

I really appreciate the bowls/ plates/spoons change with each dish that comes out. You can tell they take great pleasure in the details of the craftsmanship and  process of each dish.  

What was ordered:

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe - I need two orders of this. One egg is not meant for sharing! Yum yum!
Chicken Breast wrapped with Chicken Skin - Not bad, the chicken meat was a bit dry. I would probably leave room for other items to try on my next visit
Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic - Can't go wrong with tender beef and garlic
Kurobuta Pork Cheek - Tasty. It has a nice texture to the bite
Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard - Order it! Make sure one per person if you are a foie fan. The custard is silky and the foie is melted into the broth 
Kobe Beef Silver Skin - Not too memorable - I would skip 
Foie Gras Don- Unlike the custard version, this one is a whole slice of the lobe and it's perfect to savor 
Grilled Rice Ball in Broth(Add Toppings: Salmon for the broth) - The layer of rice, ikura and fish is to my liking and they make just right. Note- might be considered bland to some
Raku's Tofu - Offered in two sizes and freshly prepared. They are known for the silky freshness of the tofu and the seasoned condiments that you sprinkle on each bite.  My dining parter did not appreciate it as much as I did. I think if you love tofu, it's worth a try. And yes, truly an experience.

All I know now is that I must hurry on back!


What you need to know: 

-- RSVP is recommended.  In fact, I insist that you do make one as people start queuing up 30 minutes before the restaurant even opens
-- Bar seating is the only area not reserved. First come first serve for bar seating. If you arrive at opening with reservations, you'll have a good chance scoring a seat 
-- They are open until 3am
-- Restaurant has two sections and one bar area 
-- Definitely consider the daily specials board
-- Just steps over from Sweets Raku. (so leave room if you are a dessert lover like myself)
-- Parking is ample in a plaza",WHB7WXYQ8X_f0_GdRa0Gfg,5,8,4,kJdJWf67nJpdqq7WtuQfAw

I first read about Raku in Gourmet Magazine's travel section (before its recent demise), and my initial reaction was, ""I gots to have it."" Taking the road less traveled (off-Strip) was a risk I was willing to take.

We dined here last fall, but I wanted to make sure I leave a well-deserved review. I fell in love with Raku's simplicity in its food, decor and friendly staff. My husband and I sat at the counter and watched the chef prepare our food. 

Here are our recommended plates: Sea Urchin in dashi broth, foie gras in egg custard, fried homemade tofu in hot broth,  and grilled chicken thighs.

4974789,2013-12-20,8,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Since my initial visit during their first year opened, I've been back a handful of times and felt it was time I updated my review.  

Raku is the kind of place we usually reserve for special occasions and recommend to out of town guests.  Our most recent visit was only last week as the Husband and I celebrated our five year wedding anniversary.

We attempted to make reservations on the same day and the only opening they had was at 9:00 pm.  We did a walk in to hopefully land a cancellation spot or two of the coveted five counter seats, and it was only a 30 minute wait for the counter seats!  Sweet!  But yes, make reservations way in advance, especially if you have a larger party or it's a weekend.

The thing to look out for is the Specials Board.  They usually list about 5-6 items on there that range from raw to cooked items.  The weirdest part about this board is that it will change during your visit there.  During our 2-3 hour dinner, we saw some things sell out and get replaced with something else.  The waitstaff doesn't mention the newer items, so it's something you just have to look out for.  (For example, oysters were not listed on the specials board but the party sitting next to us ended up ordering the last giant oyster.  They were seated after us and only knew about it because the oyster was sitting on ice right in front of them!  They had squid on ice too, but it wasn't listed on the specials board!)  So, not only are you keeping your eyes out for the changing Specials Board but you have to see what's fresh and on ice that day!  We do get a few cooked items and although they are good, the raw fish choices are always the best!

These days we skip the Robata Grill items, not because they aren't tasty but we like to focus on the more unique items.  

One of our most favorite items is the Crispy Asparagus Okaki ($5).  It's a simple asparagus that's been dredged in rice crackers and deep-fried.  I don't know why it's so good but it just is.  And when you add a little of their matcha salt, oh my gawd!  I just love it.

Another item we had on this last visit include the Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard ($10).  There's a piece of duck that lays on top of this dish, and it's actually duck liver they use, not goose.  The foie gras is already mixed in with the egg, so it gives the whole dish a rich egg taste.  

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe ($9) is another unusual pairing, mostly because of the mountain yam that gives this dish a slimy texture.  You break up the egg and mix it all together, but you can't help but notice the slimy effect from the mountain yam.  It's a tasty nonetheless.  

The Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi ($9.50) is something that not everyone would enjoy.  The Husband isn't usually a fan of liver, except served foie gras style, but he was game.  And it did still lend a livery taste, but it's something that you have to try once.

I always enjoy homemade tofu and Raku's Tofu (Whole $5.50) does not disappoint.  They server theirs with bonito shavings, ginger, and scallions.

The four condiments placed on every table should not go ignored, especially the green tea salt and their own soy sauce.  Yum!

Since they expanded, their bathrooms are indeed something to look at.  First off, it's so clean and pristine and holds one of the cleanest fish tanks you'll ever see on Spring Mountain! 

Service on our last few visits have been much better compared to my first visit.  The waitress that took care of us at the counter never let my water glass go empty and she was always letting us know when our food was coming so we weren't waiting too long and giving us clean plates too.

My only real gripe was this: Although I usually love sitting at the counter so I can watch the chefs at work, I also can't overlook things that probably shouldn't be seen by dining guests.  One of the prep guys at the counter sneezed into his hands and continued prepping the food.  I was totally turned off by this, especially because there was a sink right behind him.  It wasn't too long after when the Husband said to me that we weren't going to be ordering anymore cold foods.  When I inquired as to why, he said he noticed the same prep guy just cough into his hands and continue working.  Yes, a sneeze and cough into the very bare hands that were prepping the food.  Yuck.

Nonetheless, we still do love Raku and would continue recommending it.  But alas, those basic hygiene issues need to be addressed!

My boyfriend and I have only been once. Primarily because when we went, we ordered a ton of stuff and our bill for just the two of us was $$$$$, so we had to limit ourselves.

We started we the Kobe Liver Sashimi which was recommended to us by a friend, but it was definitely not our cup of tea. Raw liver, which tastes resembled a penny lingering in my mouth, was only bearable due to the crispy garlic and small drop of oil on top. I can say I tried it, but we most likely never order it again. We also tried the special of the day which was a ahi toro sashimi. That was a little pricey but well worth it. The toro is the fattier part of the tuna belly and boy did it melt in your mouth. So amazing.

Next came the Foie Gras with the soy-glazed base as well as the kobe skirt steak with garlic. This was the first time I've tried foie gras and if that's what all foie gras taste like, holy cow! I've just hopped on the foie gras train to the party in my mouth. We also ordered the juicy deep fried chicken and that was delicious as well.

Raku is another excellent offering in Chinatown.

- Service was perfect.  Detailed descriptions of the food and nicely paced
- The space is a little tight, but that gives you an opportunity to spy on what others are eating and then ask for it when your server comes around

The Food:

- Raku tofu:   Fresh, smooth, and served with nice accompaniments
- Sunomono:  The best sunomono salad I've ever had. Tangy, crunchy, fresh.  Mmmmm
- Chicken breast in chicken skin: Full of pop.  I'm not usually a white meat person, but they managed to keep it relatively moist
- Kobe beef with wasabi: Just wow.  Perfect temperature, texture, and delicate. Delicate wasabi, what?  Yes, delicate wasabi.  And the magic it imported to the kobe beef was special
- Kobe beef with with garlic: It was ok.  That might be because the Kobe beef with wasabi was off the charts and comparing the two felt like we were comparing a Maserati to a Lexus.  The Lexus is nice, but the Maserati takes it to another level
- Yellowtail with soy glaze:  Another perfect dish.  Fatty, firm, sweet.  Yes!
- Eringe mushrooms: My second favorite dish (after the wasabi beef).  Meaty with a slight tang
- Okra: The fish flakes complemented the dish well
- Salmon with Ikura: It was good, but not special
- Soft pork: Mixed review.  Great initial flavor, but then it got chewy.  Didn't really like it
- The whole fish special cooked two ways (fried, grilled):  What a presentation!!  The fried fish in the broth with the mochi was nuts.  So good!!!  Drink the broth!

- Whipped cheesecake dessert:  Just so good.  Creamy, sweet, fruity

BUT and this is a big BUT, my brother and I got a major case of food poisoning from eating a semi cooked oyster appetizer there, which all but ruined the last night of my bachelor party in vegas.   While I know that the extreme heat in Las Vegas makes it difficult to properly refrigerate shell fish to prevent contamination , there's no reason why a place which charges high end prices for japanese food should let this happen.  I'm sure we either got a case of rotovirus or vibrio, whatever it was, it was horrendous.  I almost collapsed at the encore craps table and then proceeded to spend the next 24 hours attached to the toilet.  If you do go, AVOID the oyster! You'll thank me for this later.

Update:
Despite trying to contact the owner several times, i was consistently ignored until I wrote a letter to the Nevada Public Health Service who promptly did launch an investigation. The response, well it was a short email that didn't even admit guilt for our illness.

Food:  food was pretty good. It's mostly an Yakatori place but I think the non Yakatori items were the hit. I loved the froie rice bowl. It was a small portion but froie is very rich so a little goes a long way. It came on a bed of rice and the rice soaks up all the sauces and juices the froie was cooked in. I also really loved the Uni with salmon roe and poached egg. The combination was very interesting and unique. All the other Yakatori items we got were good but not incredibly special.

AMBIANCE: Good amount of lighting. Very cozy. I loved the extremely authentic vibe, and the fact that so many of the patrons were obvious regulars. 

FOOD: very good. We had:
- Kurobuta pork cheek: probably the worst of the grilled items we ordered. For whatever reason, the meat was extremely chewy, to the point of being inedible in some cases.
- Yellowtail: ooh so good. SO well prepared-- seared on the outside and slightly rare on the inside, extremely tender and delicious. My fave of the night
- Homemade agedashi tofu: very unique, and when paired with ikura and the soy based broth... yum yum
- Balsalmic glazed duck: good, but nothing to write home about

5045233,2018-01-30,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Hype is real, y'all. Make a reservation.

Five stars because dining at Raku is an exercise in appreciating taste and texture. For instance, when you order the house-made tofu, it comes with ginger, minced chives, and bonito flakes. Our server instructed us to try it with the house matcha salt first, then to try it with the accompaniments and the house-made soy sauce. One dish has a bunch of flavor permutations and every aspect is beautifully done. 

This is how eating ought to be. The bf remarked during our meal that he's starting to realize that eating well isn't about quantity, but quality. Five stars for that epiphany alone.

Food arrives as it's made so if you put in a bunch of stuff from the beginning, you can relax and enjoy it slowly. Raku has these gorgeous, spacious tables so you can have a nice conversation, but food is the centerpiece. Take the time to taste and savor it. Roll it around in your mouth. 

The table accompaniments are bomb. There's the aforementioned house soy sauce and matcha salt, a house shishito pepper mix (kind of like house togarashi) and a crazy-hot, crazy-delicious bottle of pepper-infused sake. The latter is freaking delicious. Raku also sells these if you want to take some home.

We paid $30 a head for two of us. We got:

1/2 order Raku's tofu (FAVORITE - MUST ORDER)
1/2 order Agedashi tofu (good - the texture is phenomenal)
Kobe beef liver sashimi (interesting textures and flavors cuz u have options of stuff to dip in)
Foie Gras egg custard (good - comes with a sliver of duck breast)
Iberico (good - perfectly cooked pork)
Enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon (GREAT - HIGHLY RECOMMEND)
Cheesecake (good - HIGHLY RECOMMEND)
Tea (HIGHLY RECOMMEND - it's a deep, dark tea that offsets the richness of the food nicely)

We were so close to getting the grilled foie gras but we were content, not overly stuffed, and decided to save it for the next visit. Gonna stop here every time we're in town for sure.",-EuXDbUI5Xkmq2tTf5SIIA,2,0,5,CkZwm3a9lQZy9faPE7jVfQ
5046882,2016-06-14,6,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Your price is way too high you need to cut ittt...cut it cut it cut it.  Although pricey, Raku was worth the experience.  Just don't go all cray like I did by ordering foie gras and uni only dishes.  Next thing you know you're looking like a baby whale in a tight dress at Omnia.  Not cute for a Friyay fun date with bae in Baegas.

I definitely recommend the seared foie gras with rice.  It sounded so basic but the rice actually balanced out the richness of the foie perfectly.  It was topped with just a simple sweet soy sauce and it worked.  That was definitely my favorite dish of the night.  The kobe beef skewer was forgettable.  I guess the selling point is the garlic on top but I'd pass on that one.  Same for the pork cheek.  We ordered a few skewers but none really stood out to me, they were nothing special.  I did however enjoy their fresh tofu.  I ordered both the agedashi version and the fresh plain version.  Both were good, although I wish they also offered some sort of sauce for the plain version.  The dry condiments that accompanied the rather large chunk of fresh tofu didn't do much for it, it just felt like something was missing.  The dish needed some type of soup or sauce to help wash down all that tofu.  

The poached egg with uni and fish roe was another dish that I enjoyed.  The warm egg yolk mixed in with the uni was like yaaas give it to me.   However, if you're going to order this dish or the agedashi tofu, then don't order their miso soup and vice versa because they contain the exact same mushrooms and condiments which made all three dishes taste the same.  I was disappointed by their lack of creativity there.  The buttered scallops, I mean scallop (just one) was good.  I liked the beautiful presentation on the shell.  It was just a taddd bit overcooked but flavor wise it was very tasty.  The grilled salmon belly was good, again they chose to serve this fish plain with no sauce, just some grated radish, but I would've preferred it with some ponzu.  

Their selection of sake is the most extensive that I've ever seen.  Definitely order a few different glasses to try.  And finally, I thought our server was a bit introverted and wasn't very engaging.  When he was going over the specials with us it just felt like he was trying to get through them as fast as possible.  I think service could be better given that people go off the strip to come here and are looking to enjoy both the atmosphere and food.",EWJMLFFl9po0E8dRWuHOOA,7,8,4,fGyuU4tz4vKoqUAuqvM2Nw
5051435,2011-11-23,4,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I heard great things of the Sake tasting so decided to come at the lure of unlimited drink and eats for $45. 

There was about 20 sakes to try as well as light/dark Asahi. Sake isn't a spirit I am well versed in but know enough to see some of these are quality items. I was impressed with some of the smoothness and flavor of some of these and makes me rethink about adding a daiginjo sake into our spirit collection. 

The buffet ranged from-

Robatas: filet w/ garlic, chicken thigh, pork belly, bacon enoki, mushroom, tomato.
Oden: 3kinds of fishcake, soybean curd wrapped mochi, beef tendons, chicken meatballs, seaweed, noodles, potato, radish. 
Apps: asparagus wrapped in panko/nuts, tempura icefish, fried chicken, roast beef, tofu with tomato, cold tofu, whole fried shrimp, chopped seafood with/pickled bonito guts, sashimi w/ ponzu, baby radish to dip in fermented bean paste or mustard.
Dessert: brown sugar custard/jelly in condense milk with a dried goji berry.

I probably missed a few things, but these were recurring items. I can see the quality of the food here definitely. The oden beef tendons are some of the best I've had. The robatas definitely get the special flavor of the binchotan charcoal imparted on them. The tofu has superb texture. 

Now the rub of this event- it was Disneyland status wait. We waited to pay. We waited for food. No food was up there a few times we went so it was another wait for anything to come out. We waited to get to seat in one of the limited seating areas. The layout makes for intimate dining but is not very good for banquet style as many of the aisles are narrow and tables/areas aren't made for maximum utility. You can come later, but a lot of the food has been already attacked and I don't know how freshly made a ton of it will be. Since it's usually pretty pricey to eat here, I probably did get my moneys worth even though I wouldn't say I was neither too drunk or too full by the time we decided to go already. 

The food was good, but I don't know if I was floored by it enough to justify regular pricing. It's probably significantly better when it's not made in larger plates, but some I got straight from the kitchen piping hot. I also think I'm forever disappointed by my izakaya style meals here on out as none can top an epic night at Shunju in Roppongi for me. 

There are some more gourmet items I'm still dying to try, so I will be back for a regular dining experience to try the more unique offerings and skip the basics this buffet has served.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,2,4,lZt8GY1SGMgW3b-DhwolKQ

RESERVATIONS:
Make sure you make them!  We called the day before and were lucky enough to get reservations for 6pm on a Friday night.  Many people who walked in soon after they opened (they open at 6pm) were told there would not be a table available until midnight.

FOOD:
*Miso Soup - Mmmmm!  I think this is the best miso soup I've ever had!  Be aware, you won't get the miso soup at the beginning of your meal, it'll probably come after 3-4 dishes as they make their soup from scratch.  The soup contains homemade tofu, green onions, and small mushrooms.

*Manila Clams - YUMM!  The clams were on special so I'm not sure if they have it all the time.  The clams were tender and extremely fresh.  The broth was delicious!  I found myself drinking soup spoonfuls of the broth once I was done eating the clams. 

*Asparagus Crispy Tempura - Yummy.  We needed veggies and decided to order the asparagus, which I'm glad we did!  Two large pieces of asparagus are crusted with Japanese rice crackers - an original combination!

*Enoki Mushrooms wrapped with Bacon - Yum!  A generous heap of enoki mushrooms is wrapped with bacon.  (2 skewers per order)

*Butter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce - Yummy!  One large scallop is cut up in three pieces with green onions on the side.  The scallop was tender and buttery delicious!

*Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi - Good!!  I was a little bit iffy at the sight of a good amount of wasabi placed on top of the beef filet pieces, but it was delicious!  Raku's wasabi is FRESH and created a slight kick for the tender filet pieces.

*Kurobuta Pork Cheek - Delicious!  The pork cheek was extremely tender.

*Tsukune (Ground Chicken) -  YUM!!  The ground chicken was perfectly cooked and drizzled with a slightly sweet sauce.

LOCATION:
Raku is located off the strip on Spring Mountain Road at Seoul Plaza.  It's about a $10 cab ride.  Note: make sure you have a number of a cab company to get back to the strip, cabs do not stop here regularly.

All the waitresses were exceptionally nice.  Once you've been seated, two blackboards are brought to your table (not necessarily at the same time) of the food and drink specials.  Everything was well explained as well as our finished plates were almost immediately cleared off.

I could not find one bad thing about this place. I just wish we had this in Texas. We made a reservation and got one at 12:30 AM on Saturday, we almost cancelled because we were so tired. I am really glad we didnt.. Whats more is they had full occupancy pretty much the whole time we were there. People were coming in every 20 minutes or so. 

We started with the yellowtail carpaccio(was really fresh)..
agedashi tofu (great size, yummy dashi).. 
we each got 1 steamed foie gras egg custard because it was awesomee (it was the heavist thing we ordered considering everything else were smaller portioned but wow, i could have this everyday..
the grill were a single skewer each..from the grill we had chicken thigh (very juicy), chicken breast with chicken skin (highly recommend this)..duck with balsamic soy sauce (also another great dish).. direct flamed eggplant (it was quite different)..

I will come back and i really hope this talented young chef doesnt become a celebrity chef like those in the strip. Really loved the ambiance and the cordial reception and service..",5qx248jFgSE-1vZJefV20Q,3,1,5,OZfDZLi5qVKpmrBOOXM79w

We feasted on the the chalkboard striped amberjack sashimi for a starter and I enjoyed miso soup and the lady had a scary looking dish with uni and salmon roe that was fit for fear factor. The staff I think was slightly impressed that she not only liked it but finished it. 

From there we attacked the grilled apps with gusto. Sampling several treats we picked out favorites and ordered a second round. My favorites were the kobe skewers and the scallop.

We enjoyed hot and cold saki and the selection was reasonable and extensive.

It's not the absolute best or refined Japanese or high-end izakaya style restaurant, but I am comparing to this to other high-end and Michelin-starred fine dining joints, so 4.5 is pretty darn respectable.

House-made tofu - excellent
Sashimi course - excellent
Oysters with caviar - excellent
Grilled cherry tomatoes - fairly weak
Chicken wing - nice, but nothing special
Grilled toro - very good
Asparagus ""tempura"" - fine
Grilled king crab leg - excellent
Foie gras with black garlic don - heavy, but awesome
Grilled pork - very good
Grilled beef - weaker dish

Strawberry sorbet - fine
Green tea creme brulee - very good

For starters, agedashi tofu.  Sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.

From the robata grill, Kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), ""Kobe"" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), ""Kobe"" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).

Finally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  They feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  Some of the dishes are out there.  One night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  Both surprisingly delicious.  Keep an open mind.  The progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  Well worth the $100 or $150.  

Note:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.

Tip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  Depending on how much they ""like"" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an Asian thing).

They are only open for dinner, so if you decide last minute call right when they open and I've been able to grab either a late dinner (after 10) or at the bar. They are usualy very busy and packed though, but because of their small size they can't accommodate a large volume.

They have their staple foods like wasabi kobe beef, bacon wrapped asparagus, their 1/2 cold 1/2 fried tofu, and of course their daily specials. I always try to get atleast 1 dish off their specials. Be sure to get any of their whole fish whenever it's offered. They serve half of it sashimi style and the pieces literally melt in your mouth. The other half they threw on the grill and it was so moist. I am not a fan of foie gras but I tried some of their egg custard a friend ordered and it was delicious.

Many rave about Raku, including Mr. Bizarre foods: Andrew Zimmern. He spoke very highly about his 2 favorite restaurants in Vegas that didn't make his shows and Raku was one of them. It's also rated 4.5/5 stars over 600 reviews on Yelp and is high on every food list. I had to see what the hype was about!

The food is absolutely glorious! The food is cooked Robata style meaning fireside cooking or Japanese style grilling. It's so simple but the flavor will blow your mind. I remember trying the Salmon with the perfectly grilled crispy skin. After the 1st bite, I immediately ordered 2 more! I also ordered the chicken wrapped with chicken skin, chicken thigh steak with lime, the salmon with Ikura Oroshi, the Enoki Mushroom with bacon! Each dish was memorable!

I've always wanted to try the infamous Blue Fin Tuna and Raku took my virginity. It melted in my mouth and the presentation was beautiful. I thought to myself so that's why it's endangered! I would have been happy with 3 orders of Blue Fin.

I had reservation for 730 we got there around 630 and they seated us early. I love the little wooden box with the button you can push to summon a waitress. The Sake cup presentation was really cool and there was one cup that was hilarious....see the pictures. The little private dojo style room we sat in transported you to Japan. The bathroom with the rose petals on the ground and huge tree was nifty and the service was top notch.

The restaurant only has about 10-12 tables along with a small room for groups near the back. I'd suggest calling ahead for a reservation, but since they stay open so late (someone tells me 3 a.m.?), chances are you'll be seated eventually.

the Omakase: it was ten dishes, very delicious for the most part, except for the fish, because the bone was in it and they were annoying to eat. i did not like the fish also because the face was look straight at me. glad they only gave us one fish to share. stuff i did enjoy 
foie gras bowl: simple rice bowl with teriyaki and what looked like a full duck liver, which was tender and delicious as solid butter. 
house made tofu: interesting experience, it was cold, and had salt and dips that were also interesting. imagine a flavorless ice cream with salty toppings. sounds like a bad experience, but it was good. 
the sashimi was good, i liked how our waitress told us how to eat the different types of fish, and which sauces and salts the fish were intended to be eaten with. 
there were other dishes, but each omakase is different based on the chef, but i think these three things were standard
the dessert was pretty awesome the Cream cheese with strawberry sauce on the side was delicious.
the service: very nice waitress,  very helpful with the menu. lots of water refills and lots of checking up on us. i loved how she told us how the chef intended for us to enjoy each dish. added to the experience.
The restaurant: the decor was a typical Japanese restaurant. nothing special about it. it was standard. the bathroom had a cool looking sink though. the tables had a cool slot for the menu. it was an actual slit made just for the menu, so we could pick it up to look at and it would not be in our way. very innovative i thought.

Protip: EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE RESTROOM JUST USE IT, IT LOOKS F*CKN DOPE. Save yourself the trouble and make a reservation! This place gets bu$$$y. Oh and try the pork belly. Your taste buds can thank me later.",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,3,2,5,Ha0ld59JZzeB_VLyQVnkCQ

I ate at Raku for probably the sixth time last night, and while I do not partake in the fanciest of the offerings there, i.e. live uni udon, I still love it. I would say the majority of the menu is Japanese-style skewers, so there are lots of tasty meats on sticks, which might sound less than stellar, but each skewer is of the highest quality and prepared with the tenderest attention to detail. I am happy with my asparagus on a stick and the ""Yummy Miso Soup"". (That is what they call it, and it is indeed the yummiest miso I have ever slurped!) I even love the Popeye Salad-- a spinach salad with a warm dressing, mushrooms and little fried onions. And, I drink the iced roasted green tea by the bucketful. 

The tofu was better last night than on my previous visits. We had half cold and half hot, and both were wonderful. We were also treated to some super rare sake. Our waitress told us that you can not even buy this particular sake in Japan, so when Japanese people come to the restaurant, they are astonished and drink plenty of it! Oh, and we had the sorbets for dessert, and they were super sweet and refreshing. When summertime comes, I could imagine eating a gallon of the pomegranate.

I love the coziness of the space. You feel like you could just linger at the table forever, but we try not to. The bathroom is incredible. (Just check it out.) The servers are very charming, especially when they come over with the specials board and explain them all. Sometimes their Japanese accent prevents me from understanding everything, but I really don't mind because it is delivered with such care and pride. Do beware of the board as sometimes things on the board are more expensive than you might think. For example, one evening we ordered some unagi, and it was $30 for a rather small portion. Still overall, I think the prices are reasonable. 

The entire restaurant, from the painting of the walls to the salts on the table, are hand prepared by the chef. With such attention to detail and passion, you feel loved when you eat at Raku, and everyone wants to be loved.

Perhaps it's a true 4 star if you like tofu, urchin, etc. I'll preface this by saying I do truly hate tofu, so I'm going to wait to try this famous tofu another time when I have a tofu lover in-tow. I couldn't justify spending the money on it if it turned out to taste like normal tofu!

Yellowtail carpaccio - decent, but for $11 I wasn't super impressed. It tasted fresh, but it wasn't melt in your mouth amazing or anything. 

Pork Cheek - again ,pretty good, but I much prefer pork belly myself. We ordered  1 order for 2 of us and weren't all that anxious to get another one. 

Lamb chop - Very tasty. Would I come back here just for this lamb chop? No, but I can say it was prepared perfectly. 

Duck - I think this may have been my favorite. Sad there were only 3 tiny bites on it. 

Kobe with garlic - fiance's fav. I've had better kobe elsewhere, but it did taste good. 

Foie gras - I do LOVE foie gras, so I loved this.. but.... it doesn't compare to the interesting creative foie gras preparations I've had at Ogden, Nobu, etc. Where's my peanut foam or pomegranate jelly? It was well prepared, but I can say that about 90% of the foie gras I've eaten in my life. With a cut this fatty you need acid or a starch to cut it, but this was just fat on a plate. 

We wanted to try the potato-corn thingy, but they were out. 

Cost: $60 for 2 of us, we definitely left still hungry. Definitely be sure to ask the price on the specials - most of the ones we were considering were $18+++.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,1,0,4,3sVn6q1tmxBH7l0oxDgetw

Not visited since 2009, when visiting as a tourist and unadvisedly walking from-and-back-to The Strip, it was finally at the close of 2014 that a return visit to Raku was planned and although three visits to its Sweets sister just down the way have proven universally stellar over the past 18 months a walk-in seat in one of the expanded private rooms proved a slightly less than ideal experience, the service almost non-existent for the first fourty-five minutes while a few of the plates lacked the luster some would suggest overrides every single thing on Mitsuo Endo's somewhat stagnant menu.

Undoubtedly the most upscale Izakaya...or Aburiya...in a city where the genre has expanded substantially since Raku opened its doors it was in a small line that our party stood until the door was unlocked at six o'clock and inquiring as to whether reservations were full it was explained that a four-top was available, provided an exit by 7:30 when the next party was due...our much delayed order assuring an exit closer to 8:45, a time in which no less than three similar tables still sat empty leading one to wonder why the bar area was still jam packed.

Featuring perhaps fifty plates familiar from a visit five years prior, plus seven chalkboard specials from which the Sea Breem duo was selected, it was just after 7:50 when our fist bites hit the table and with silky fish set against bites of wood-fired skin plus an assortment of accoutrements the flavor profile was delicate and nuanced, the follow-up fried chicken exactly the opposite with an overhead smash of flavor beneath light tempura as a light salad beneath served as an admirable foil to the of the bird.

Onward to pork, first crispy ear and then supple belly, suffice it to say that both were quite tasty though somewhat unremarkable in a world where both are frequently offered on all sorts of menus but moving onward to the restaurant's signature tofu I will admit that their suggestion of it being the 'best' is not at all hyperbole, the light tempura overlying an airy omelet bathed in dashi singlehandedly reinventing an ingredient generally nowhere near as enthralling as bursting salmon roe and wakami added texture and brine.

At this point treated to a fried fish duo in which the yellowtail belly proved a bit dried out and a step in the wrong direction from simply doing it raw it was undoubtedly the second half of the aforementioned breem that stole the show and served in the same broth as the tofu with everything from skin to bones edible quick work was made of the bowl, the follow-up chawanmushi topped with foie gras another umami-laden dish slightly compromised in texture by overcooked liver, though the custard itself was divine.
Rounding out the meal with three grilled items, the lamb chop and pork cheek intense with wood and smoke while the duck got lost in the soy, plus a bowl of chilled soba draped in a perfectly poached egg it was only here that the table was informed that the uni dish ordered could not be prepared because the restaurant was 'out of urchin' and opting against desserts as only cheesecake, crème brûlée, and sorbet were offered it was with tea that the night came to a close - the $66 per person tab an admitted deal compared to strip prices, though the overall experience failed to meet the highs offered by some of Las Vegas Boulevard's bests, a bit of a change from 2009 no matter what some may say of the emergence of Spring Mountain Road.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps an effect of having now eaten at some of the world's best, including places like SAISON where pristine ingredients cooked over an open flame have taken on a whole new degree of creativity and skill, there is little doubt that those visiting Raku are guaranteed to have a good meal yet with so little change on the menu in a city where evolution is the rule it will be some time before I find myself rushing back...at least not until a few more Izakaya are visited to see if there is a more impressive experience to be found.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,3,4,_oEFmVN6X3M-tTG-LUdqEA

It was really as good as others said. Took me literally 2 months to get a reservation, the voicemail they leave when calling is hard to understand so I called at all different times and finally they called me back and we got a 10pm seating which was 4 hours after the time we normally eat. We settled at that time as we were dying to try this place.  

Greeted promptly upon entering and they sat down and wanted to take our drinks before we could even look at the menu. After that they came back and gave us their specials on a black chalkboard. A couple minutes later they wanted to take our order. We were by the front door and saw a lot of people being turned away even though there were a lot of free tables available in the restaurant.

Food was 10+ stars excellent, everything was absolutely perfect to the finest detail. We were so full we wanted to take some food home and they wouldn't allow us to take the roe over rice with us but did let us take the ice fish wish us. Not sure why that was the case but oh well.

I especially became excited when I was blown away by their sister dessert restaurant nearby, BUT I am sad to report that this place is overhyped. Sure, the food is good... but nothing to get excited about. I have high expectations for izakaya/sushi ""high-end"" restaurants but Raku fits right in with any average izakaya in LA (unfortunately). When I spend $75-100 on dinner, it is almost always (and should be!) a memorable meal. Raku's was not.

.+ uni, poached egg, and salmon roe - one of their cold dishes. I was most excited to try this one, but the uni was scarce and overpowered by all of the other flavors versus complimented. 

+ yakitori (skewers) - we tried the scallop, which was phenomenal, but the others not so much. Good, but again very average.

+ chicken - moist and flavorful. Good crunch. Served over spinach, but nothing better than karaage I can get at any other restaurant.

+ Rice cracker crusted asparagus - interesting take on tempura because of their use of rice crackers crushed up versus panko breading. 

+ yellowtail carpaccio - I love yellowtail and their quality was a little above average. The preparation of the carpaccio was poorly executed.

+ Foie gras rice bowl - I enjoyed this dish the most because the foie gras was prepared and served perfectly. The portion is quite small but don't let that fool you-- this dish is very filling and my most favorite out of the others.

To celebrate a special occasion, I went here. We were considering getting the omakase for $100/person but that's like a lottery - you don't know what items you'll get. Although I've never had anything I didn't like from this place, we had specific things we wanted to try. 

My faves:
Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi, Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic, Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce, Foie Gras with Glazed Soy-base Sauce, Asparagus with Bacon, Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon and Green Tea Creme Brulee. I love their blue fin sashimi but we didn't order that this time.

Aside from my faves, we also tried Raku's homemade tofu, juicy deep-fried chicken, steamed foie gras egg custard, chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin, kobe beef silver skin, Iberico pork and kanpachi kama.

Homemade Tofu:
Can be ordered in half or full portions. Comes with ginger, green onions and bonito. The texture of the tofu is so different from all the tofu I've ever had. It has the consistency of formed cottage cheese. 4.5/5

Juicy Deep-Fried Chicken:
Crispy skin, juicy fatty chicken. Absolutely delicious! 5/5

Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard:
This dish has the same broth as in agedashi tofu. This chawanmushi has a mild foie gras taste to it and has a piece of duck on top. 5/5

Chicken Breast Wrapped with Chicken Skin:
Slightly crisp chicken skin seasoned with salt. For some reason, I really liked the simplicity of this dish. 5/5

Kobe Beef Silver Skin:
A bit oily and sweet. This is the skin of a cow put on a skewer and grilled. 4/5

Iberico Pork:
I love jamon Iberico and I was thinking this would be similar. But this is actual chunks of pork with a yummy sauce and grilled. 5/5

Kanpachi Kama:
Perfectly grilled amberjack collar with a nice ponzu/soy dipping sauce. Although I was not in the mood for fish, I still think this is the best kama in town. Very meaty, moist (terrible word) and perfectly cooked. 5/5

Although the last time we went here, they didn't have 2 items we wanted: Poached Egg w/ Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe and, Hamachi Kama. They also changed their decor.

Raku is in a strip mall kind of hidden from view from Spring Mountain traffic.  It is very hard to get a reservation.  Tried numerous times and got their voicemail saying reservations are taken usually between 2 PM - 5 PM only.  They still didn't pick up the phone when I tried calling during this window.  It seems like they have plenty of business from word of mouth and don't really care to make reservations over the phone.
Anyways, we arrived without a reservation around 8 PM on July 3.  Had a 20 minute wait which was fine, even though half the tables were empty.
Here's the run down of what we tried:
1.  Sashimi salad:  it was ok, not great.  Lots of spinach, not too much sashimi.
2.  Egg custard with salmon roe and sea urchin.  Was really excited about this dish, but it was mediocre.  I didn't care for the raw egg very much.
3.  Blue fin tuna sashimi.  This was excellent.  Came with 2 different types of REAL wasabe, which you could tell was legit from the fibrousness (?).  The tuna melted in my mouth.
4.  Wagyu kobe skewer with garlic and skewer with wasabi.  Excellent.  No complaints.
5.  Foie gras with soy glaze.  Superb.  Tasted like pure fat and melted in your mouth.  My boss took one bite and yelled out  ""Oh my God....This is f-ing delicous!""  to which everyone including the master sushi chef looked at him.  Hilarious.
6.  Agedashi tofu.  Home-made tofu...the hot version.  It was the best tofu I ever had.
7.  Watermelon sorbet with red bean.  It was okay.  A little too sweet, but was good since it was 110 degrees outside.
8.  Sake.  Tasty and ice cold.

-Yellowtail carpaccio
-Kobe beef filet with wasabi

-Agedashi tofu

Raku is small, with about 10 tables, some bar seating, and a private room seating.  We ordered the famous cold tofu, hot tofu, grouper special, pork belly skewer, Kobe beef skewer with wasabi, salmon skewer, lamb chop, and molten chocolate lava cake.  All of the food was awesome!

1. You hold sake tasting event with a buffet for the reasonable price of $45.
2. You are generous with said items and beer.
3. You have a friendly staff that can withstand the onslaught of ravenous Yelpers.
4. You are the reason I got to hang out with said Yelpers.

Those reasons were enough to clench my love for this place. I got the impression that these events are rare, so keep an eye out for it. Definitely attend because a normal dinner can cost way more than $45.

The buffet line consisted of fried ice fish (small anchovy size sea creatures, easily eaten like popcorn.), panko crusted asparagus, grilled asparagus skewers, bacon wrapped asparagus (a whole buffet of asparagus), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, grilled cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic beef skewers, chicken thigh skewers, pork belly, pork cheeks, pig ears, sliced kobe beef, a plethora of oden, fried turkey or chicken (the staff kept saying something different), plenty of sashimi, and more. I found that the most basic of items such as the robata style cherry tomatoes and oden were my favorite of the night. The daikon was so tender and absorbed all the wonderful flavors of the soup. The beef tendon were melt in your mouth delicious as well. 

If that was not enough, there were more than 10 sakes to try, unlimited Asahi and Asahi Dark.

We are so glad we did! This place definitely is the BEST!
Their Robata-Yaki is AMAZINGLY delicious.
My fav robata menu is Tsukune and Kobe beef silver skin(Gyu-suji). Also the homemade tofu is so silky and tasty. 

This place gets crowded so make sure to make a reservation before you go. Very first time, we had to come back on the following night with a reservation because the reservation was full and there were too many people waiting that day!

HITS:
* tofu - like the rest of the yelpers, they are heavenly, especially the one in hot soup.  it's sweet and savory, i don't think i ever tasted tofu like that.
* this sake named izu-something -  really refreshing and amazing.  if you like to try different types, you can get sake sampler.
* asparagus - battered in crunch coating which has slight sweetness.  really different.
* watermelon sorbet - wow, this is like jolly rancher except with real watermelon juice!

WHAT DA...:
* grilled cherry tomatoes -  R U serious?!?!?
* grilled rice balls - miso ball was too salty.
* pork cheek - too hard and chewy.  personally could have been cooked a little longer.

we ate many different dishes but they weren't really memorable so it's not worthy of writing.  another thing, the pace of the dishes could have been a bit slower, we felt slightly rushed.

NOTABLE MENTION:

Cocktails: Green Tea sake cocktail and a Lychee sake cocktail. Amazing!!! The Lychee flavored one was sweet and smooth and glided down my throat. My friend said the green tea one was equally delish. (We were shocked to find out that they were only $6 each when we got our bill).

Pork cheek: It was clearly a fatty piece of meat grilled to perfection. There was no greasiness, no gelatinous masses, just firm texture and awesome flavor. 

Tofu: we ordered half cold and half in the hot broth. My friend knew she liked them both and could split the order like that. The cold tofu was nicely complemented by the different ingredients it is served with. You can add your own homemade salt, fresh ginger, seaweed, etc. It was fun seeing how much fresh ginger I could actually handle in one bite. The texture of the tofu is creamy yet firm and yielding. The hot tofu was firmer around the edges and a much richer taste derived from the broth it's floating in. They were both equally gratifying. They each satisfied a different craving, one: light creamy and spiced with added flavors, the other: warm, rich and robust. 

Poached egg with see urchin and salmon roe: This was probably my favorite dish. I loved the intermingling of the delicate flavors of the very basic egg yolk, the salty salmon roe and the subtly sweet sea urchin. The tiny button mushrooms in the broth were a perfect accompaniment. I loved the few pieces of okra and the flavor it added to the overall dish. It was a very well executed play on texture and flavor. 

Enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon: Wow, not only were they a treat for the eyes, but a treat for the taste buds as well. The smoky grill flavor really shined through these little morsels. 

Sawagani (Japanese River Crab): The crabs were very crunchy! They had a nice flavor as well, but I would say the novelty here is the crunchiness and the sight of them all lined up. 

Asparagus Tempura: This was not the normal tempura batter I'm used to, but more of a nutty rice crispy texture. The asparagus was al dente (just like I like it) and the nutty flavor combined with the asparagus was a match made in heaven. 

Blue Fin Tuna sashimi: Melt in your mouth, creamy fresh fish! I've never tasted better! This was well worth the $25 price.

Green Tea ice cream: It was creamy and deliciously sweet. 

The sights and smells of this place make it a restaurant with not only amazing food but amazing atmosphere as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the prompt and courteous service. I can't wait to go back!!!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,6,5,5,x5_giDOD6ydBDx4zDIKFsA

Kurobota pork cheek

Kama mashi (salmon rice)- not on menu but THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER!
Baby abalone- tender
Green tea creme brûlée
Molten choc cake

I always send my customers there even though I had never eaten there. The truth I was a little apprehensive. I looked at the menu and I was frightened! I like to think I am adventurous when it comes to food, but alas  I am not!! I had a very bad episode trying Uni for the first time. I don't get it. To me it's the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth and I drank a big gulp from a water bottle with cigarette butts in it one time, still not as bad as the Uni. So as you can see my taste buds don't agree with some ingredients that people think are so damn great.

Anyway, from the beginning to the end our experience was awesome. The service was outstanding!! (Yes, this is in China town!!) Our server was so helpful, polite and inviting. She really made us feel welcomed. So did the rest of the staff when we walked in. Nobody looked at us like who is this Afro queen and the white man with her!! I forgot our servers name but I guess she went home because we ended our meal with another server. She was nice as well, but my first girl was over the top great! 

On to the food, we ordered some sashimi from the daily special. I believe she said they got it in that day, yellowtail from somewhere, sorry don't remember. 35.00 dollars for seven pieces. I am not that into sashimi but I saw my husband's eyes light up (she made it sound so great) so I said get it!! And I am glad we did! It was delicious! We also got some shrimp ball thingies on the special, these were so tasty, we got a second order. I have included a picture of both. My husband is still talking about it and that he can pop those things in his mouth at anytime!! Nice texture not over cooked just delicious.

From the menu we ordered Kobe beef fillet with wasabi, duck with balsamic soy sauce, butter sauteed scallop ,yellowtail with glazed soy based sauce,  enoki mushroom wrapped in bacon, fried ice fish and i believe some soup with rice ball. That broth was the least of my favorites. It was nice and clean tasting but just not for me. I think I found it fishy. Everything else was so yummy!!  I don't know what was my favorite. Everything seemed to melt in my mouth. The fried ice fish was good, I didn't love it as much as everything else, but my husband loved it. I will say and he agreed, if you like this eat it while it's hot because once it gets cold it's not so great.

The atmosphere is one of our favorites, no TVs!! It's cozy and so clean. The bathrooms are awesome make sure you check them both out. My husband was obsessing over the one with rose petals!  We started with a beer and a glass of wine. Then we decided to get a bottle to share. I believe it was a Pinot Grigio and it was really good. Our bill was about 158.00 without tip. A lot cheaper than we were expecting. WE love love love it there and can't recommend it enough. It's just such a great dining experience!!",yvAYprNnakItO2O4zjDHtw,4,2,5,QZBym-39nNr7z3NZ28etjg

We had some other dishes too. The house Tofu which I loved it paired with some of the sauces on the table and the fresh ginger. The scallop was amazing. The flavor was so good and it was cooked perfectly. We had a couple orders of the bacon wrapped asparagus since the bacon was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.

First the yellowtail was so good. It was cut into pieces with a crunchy, salty skin and no bone making it so easy an delicious to eat. 
The soba with poached egg was good too. I just love egg with anything so the fact that it comes with a perfectly poached one just makes it that much better. The Kobe beef skewers were so so tender just as you would expect. But now the killer was their pork belly. I believe it's kurobuta pork belly. That might not be spelled right but close enough for you to find it on the menu. You need to get this. It is absolutely the best pork belly I have ever had. It just melts right when it hits your mouth. It's perfect with a bite of rice. I could just come order three of these and be happy. We also got the creme brûlée which was pretty good.

As has been mentioned before the service you get at Raku is beyond slow and extremely frustrating to deal with. This was at 6:30 and there were only about 15 other people in the place for reference.

Food wise we started with a good but overpriced $12 salad. Next was the whole fried shrimp which were pretty good but need a dipping sauce in my opinion. Moving on we had tried the scallop which was OK but overcooked, we ordered another one later and it was overcooked as well. After that we got the fried pig ear and it was pretty good, different, and still pretty good.

We tried the kobe beef tendon which is a gelatinous, slightly chewy, oddly flavored piece of matter that we won't be getting again, ever. We had 2 different kinds of kobe skewer. The one with the garlic chips which was good and the other with wasabe which was very good!

Next came the bluefin tuna sashimi special which was excellent! High quality, great flavor and melts in your mouth. Then the guy next to us ordered cod sperm, seriously. What the hell, I gave it a shot and I don't know that I'll be rushing back to do so again. It had a creamy texture and tasted mostly of the ponzu sauce I'd dipped it in. It was OK but rather odd and it looked like golf ball sized brains!

All in all we thought it was OK but won't be rushing back. Plus 4 draft Sapporo beers for 2 people and the bill came to $125.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,4,0,3,ufgld6jlJNrrdEJEmMQ4yw

Raku makes their own tofu, so we started with a 1/2 order of their most popular one. It was delicious. We selected a large variety of meats and vegetables from the grill. Apparently, Raku imports their coals for the grill from Japan. Whatever they're doing, they need to keep doing. Everything was delicious. My favorites were the garlic Kobe steak and bacon wrapped tomatoes. My husband loved the yellowtail tuna. Everything comes out on 2-3 bite skewers and is arranged in order of lightest to heaviest.

5458224,2014-09-02,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I love Las Vegas.  It's become quite the culinary adventure.  We are not buffet eaters.  I'm pretty turned off by the feeding frenzy experience.  

You see people piling combinations of food on their plate that you would never serve together.  Pizza next to sushi next to prime rib.  People shoveling food into their mouths as fast as they can, sometimes chewing once or twice before swallowing.  I prefer a more refined dinning experience.  Sorry for the rant, on to Raku!

Raku's not far from the strip.  Cab ride from the Monte Carlo ran about $14.00.  I was interested in the Omakase experience, but did not want to get stuck with a dish neither of us wanted, aka any kind of liver (Beef, Chicken, or Monkfish) with the exception of foie gras.  

I did not want to insult the Chef and try and tell him what not to serve with the Omakase.  So I created my own list and just handed it to our waitress.  That worked out very well.

I had read a few other reviews that the food comes out at a snails pace.  This was not the case.  Dishes were brought out at a reasonable pace, sometimes two at a time.

(2) Miso soup-
Raku's Miso soup was the best I've ever had.  Creamy house made tofu put it over the top.

(1) Assorted Sushi-
You tell the waitress how much you want to spend and they serve you accordingly.  I figured $20.00 bucks would be enough.  You don't get much for $20.00, but I will say it was all awesome!

(1) Agedashi Tofu Half Order-
I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was divine.  One of the best dishes of the night.

(2) Butter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce-
More please.

(2) Kobe Beef Filet-
Tender as hell and tasty.  Watch out for that Wasabi, it's the real thing.

(2) Yellowtail with Glazed Soy-based Sauce-
Very good indeed.

(1) Chicken Thigh Steak with Teriaki-
Cooked perfectly, a must order if you love good chicken.

(2) Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon-
It's wrapped in bacon, please.  :  )

(2) Asparagus Yakitori-
Just to say I had some veg!

(2) Kobe Beef Outside Skirt with Garlic-
Good, but not as good as the Filet.

(2) Kurobuta Pork Cheek-
Good flavor, not into the texture.  Cheeky.  Least favorite of the night.

(1) Juicy Deep Fried Chicken-
Just awesome.  The chefs know what they are doing!

(1) Strawberry Sorbert-
They must make this here with real fresh Strawberries.  The best.

Lots of Sapporo and Hot Sake. 

With tip got out of there under $250.00.  My Girlfriend and I were stuffed!  I might have over ordered by one or two dishes.  

Dinner was great but I'm pretty sure I'm guilty of committing one or two of the Seven Deadly Sins.  It is Sin City after all, how apropos.",gJXuy_foQEwYINnlLZxZsw,6,2,5,9Jru-HRCt7bFMmg42bzHAQ

Though small. you can get booths for private groups as in traditional Japanese restaurants and may need to book in advance. The Staff is very warm and friendly.

Foie gras was also quite delicious. Perhaps the best dish on the menu was one of the specials we ordered which was a Kobe beef hamburger marinaded in a tomato sauce and served in a pot almost like a stew. As I was eating it, it occurred to me that this was perhaps the greatest dish, maybe even meal, I've ever eaten. We tried all of the different Kobe beef skewers and they were all delicious, the silver lining ones were my favorite by far. Overall the experience and ambience was incredible - the place is really small and feels like a place in Tokyo, where the owner/chef is from. I would imagine this is the closest you can get to Tokyo without actually being there. I see the other reviews are polar. The people who hated it didn't like the food. Honestly those reviews seem like they don't like Japanese cuisine to begin with and have no business in Raku, because this was one of the greatest meals I've ever had.

For the higher priced omakase (which is still very reasonable), we enjoy nine delicious courses.  While the menu does change with the seasons, our highlights have included:

*Housemade tofu, the consistency of foie gras and as fresh as they come,
*Skewers of A-5 Wagyu beef, served with teriyaki and fresh wasabi,
*Skewers of Iberico pork, lucious and perfectly fatty,
*Grilled Alaskan King Crab, served with a slice of lemon,
*Skewers of grilled bamboo, pleasantly meaty,
*Grilled foie gras served over rice, so rich and decadent,
*Japanese cheesecake for dessert, lighter than traditional, the perfect way to end the meal.

While sushi is also served in the omakase, it is not the centerpiece of the meal (as is often in other Japanese establishments).  The meal is always balanced between seafood and other meat dishes.  And the service is always attentive and helpful.

5486662,2011-05-29,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I don't give five star reviews lightly. In fact, I kind of don't even want to write this review because more people will start going here and it will get even harder to get a reservation. But here we go:

This place is magic.

I know what you're thinking: ""I don't believe in magic"" except you will after you visit Raku. Imagine homemade tofu that tastes like clouds and childhood, sitting in a warm broth and topped with wisps of dashi and irreverent bursts of roe with just the tiniest little swirl of sweet chili paste. I would happily eat their age dashi weekly if I could, perhaps even daily. The kurubata menu is filled with lots of little taste teasers -- I especially loved the butter poached scallops and the fried chicken. Similarly, Raku's specials are amazing: our last visit, we were treated to flying fish two ways, as sashimi and also deep-fried in a broth. The fried preparation was fantastic, but the sashimi was paper thin and so fresh and delicate that it was almost like eating fruit slices rather than fish. I just might be ruined for other sashimi for life, always thinking about what could have been.

This is what I'm saying. Magic.

The best part of Raku is the price: a similar meal on the strip would be hundreds of dollars, but two people can eat extremely well at Raku for under a hundred dollars, including drinks. 

One caveat: make a reservation, as this is a tiny place, and it's very unlikely that you could walk in and get a table.",imIdd2eC5Bpj6Cz3gwBQpA,3,2,5,dn8DNarW0q2vcL23MunRPg
5487293,2015-08-14,1,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"RSVPd a few days in advance for dinner at 6:30 on a Thursday. We didn't need to wait once we arrived, and luckily got seated towards the quieter back. 

What we got:

Foie gras custard- love steamed scrambled egg, Chinese people eat it with cooking wine, but their foie gras infusion was killer. Great texture too. The only thing I don't like about foie gras, well one of the things, is the livery aftertaste. The custard still had that aftertaste. 

Foie gras skewer- for $17 it didn't disappoint. Literally melt in your mouth! Could've been enough for four I think, but our foie gras aficionado finished it off for us. 

Green tea cold noodle - nice, simple dish that contrasted with the rich, flavorful dishes we ordered afterward. I don't know what the process is for serving cold dishes first, but I would've appreciated this cold noodle more after eating the foie gras. Light dish in contrast to the heavy richness of the foie gras. 

Scallop - served in a hot shell. I didn't think it was amazing. 

Sea urchin with salmon roe- I'm not a uni fan, but this combo with the poached egg was awesome. Sweet, light, gooey, & interesting textures (bubble like roe & mushrooms held together by the gooey egg yolk). Like how the yolk balanced out the uni. 

Sashimi salad - that was delicious. I loved the sashimi with the miso dressing. Refreshing way to whet our appetites. 

Raku tofu- you can dress it two ways, and I preferred the chives + soy sauce way. The more I ate it the hungrier I got - so as an appetizer it did its job (making us hungrier and ready for the heartier meat dishes). 

Iberian pork skewers - a special at $10/skewer. I thought it was a tad undercooked, but the meat was definitely tender and fatty. Not a huge fan though and prob won't order it again. 

Waygu beef sashimi - aka raw beef. after eating this I realized I like my beef cooked medium rare. The beef was tender, but really chewy due to the fat on it. Like people in my party were having trouble eating it it was so chewy. At $20 a plate, I'd skip this at the next go round. 

Juicy deep fried chicken: dark chicken meat cooked like a pot roast, but with a thin crispy skin (like roast duck skin except with chicken). Chicken was underdone. Truth be told, we only ordered it bc the table next to us ordered it and I'm a fattie that loves me some fried chicken. 

Overall: I generally thought everything needed some salt (not the green tea salt on the table), and most of the red meats and ""other white meats"" could've been cooked slightly more. 

Service was very polite, though slightly over attentive. I'm not used to someone constantly coming by your table, switching out your plates after every two dishes, etc. 

And it's a very clean restaurant! I read in a cooking book (kitchen confidential) that you can tell how clean a kitchen is by how clean the bathrooms are. The bathroom here was very clean, very Japanese (ie super high tech toilets that required actual reading to operate) with an aquarium! I guess they were trying to make us feel like we were in an aquarium too with the blue walls & tile (I'm analyzing this bathroom waaaay too much...).",mHp4g3_z2dmD9UPXzuE8bQ,2,3,4,O0I-BG5g_8TBfYrE-55izw

The food is what really makes this restaurant pop. I recommend you try the daily specials off of a dry erase board which varies based on the fresh food and ingredients that are available to the chefs. I was told by the staff some of the items are flown in from Japan. They typically only have a limited number of servings and it is common for them to sell out of the specials. On my visit, they were sold out of two of the seven items listed. Many of the dishes I ordered were rich in flavor with a varying degree of teriyaki base. I enjoyed the lightly salted dishes more. i recommend the juicy fried chicken, ribs, pork cheek, and mushroom wrapped in bacon. 

The portions are small and made to order. You do not know what order the items will come out of the kitchen. However, they will definitely be hot. The prices of the items and the cost of a visit will vary depending on your appetite and food selections. The staff is extremely well versed on the menu items. A reservation is a MUST!!! 

Otherwise you will have to wait an hour or more for a table. In that situation, it would be best to leave your name and comeback in the estimated wait time.

Despite having reservations and arriving on time, it was a good 20 minutes or so before we were seated.  After being seated, the drinks came soon enough, and there was little delay in ordering, but then there was no food for a good half hour after ordering.  By the time we'd been seated about an hour, maybe two of our small plates had arrived.  As you can imagine, we devoured them promptly.

These are small plates, mind you.  Some tofu, some yakitori.  Not the kind of food that should take very long to prepare.  It took us about 2.5 hours to finish an incomplete meal - even though we weren't full, we didn't want to order more because we didn't want to wait another hour for the food.

Even worse, the tea was lukewarm and slow to be refilled.  We would maybe have been a little less annoyed if our teacups were regularly filled with piping hot tea.

Needless to say, we left unsatisfied.  The only reason for the third star is because the food we did eat actually was good, and the menu offers unique items you can't get even at other izakaya restaurants.  But I've had better.",rMPs2d3Wqzt_72DNrDcQdA,6,0,3,NQF0Shblw9eNmbBYBqDoFw

Quite honestly for 100 dollars a person I was hoping to get more than one small skewer of meat (no matter how excellent).
I know japanese portions run on the small side this was tiny.
The real letdown and the reason I took off one star was the ""dessert"".  They called it a watermelon sorbet but was really more like a granita.  After a small but excellent meal it was disappointing. It would have been nice if they included one of the dishes from Raku Sweets..

all the other dishes we tried were also outstanding, but the uni udon was definitely the best

I live in the DC area, lived in NY for four years, and been to Vegas numerous times and this takes my number one spot!

To keep it simple, I'll just list you my favorites from this restaurant:
Sake - Moon on the Water - It's pricey and their markup is a bit high at $81 for the bottle, but it tastes like flavored water. This is one of my favorite sake's - trust me, you won't regret it
Raku Tofu - Probably the freshest and best tofu you will ever have. Very clean tasting and suits very well with their homemade soy sauce or exquisite salt they have to offer
Agedashi Tofu - This tofu is fried and comes in their housemade soysauce-like broth, and it tastes really good. Both the tofu's are amazing so it just depends on if you feel like having the fried tofu with the broth or the fresh tofu
Sea Urchin with poached egg - One of my favorite dishes here. Everything in this dish to the mountain radish, the uni, the poached egg, the mushrooms, and the housemade sauce just compliments the dish so well
Appetizer - Deep Fried Chicken Asijime - mmmmm, sooooo good!

Grill Menu Vegetables:
Okra - it was okay, I could do without it 3/5 stars
Eringi Mushroom - YOU MUST GET THIS. One of my favorites. As quoted by my friend who hates mushrooms and had him try this dish ""that's the best mushroom I've ever had""

Grill Menu Meats:
Any of the grilled fish on the grill menu - I'd pass on all of these  3/5 stars
Chicken dishes - these are actually not bad, either one of the 4 options
Kobe Beef with wasabi/garlic - not bad as well 4/5
Beef Liver: cheap and delicious 5/5 stars - very good
Duck breast: 4/5 stars
Foie gras: expensive but delicious 5/5 stars

Post Menu Dishes:
Green Tea Soba noodles with poached egg - probably my favorite dish here or at least tied with the Sea Urchin and Poached egg dish. You have to order this in advance since it takes 20+ mins to prepare, but it is absolutely delicious! Make sure to save enough room for this since it's usually served after your meal!

I just love the idea of a Japanese tapas restaurant and this takes the cake! I always order way more than I should when I come here, but it's partly because I only get to have it once maybe twice a year when I visit Vegas. You have to make sure to make reservations at least a week in advance to get a table, and if there are no reservations available, your next best bet is to come and stand in line right when the restaurant opens and they'll give you a time limit for when you can stay until.

5506862,2013-03-07,3,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"After nearly 5 years away from Vegas, I was back. And as you can imagine, I had a handful of restaurants I had been dying to check out. Out of the five, only one lived up to the hype and will continue to see me whenever I'm in town. Can you guess which restaurant that was?

My wife and I made reservations a month out because we knew it would be difficult to get one if we had waited any longer. So that would be my first recommendation if you plan on coming here... reserve your spot as early as possible. During dinner, I saw a couple come in without a reservation and they were regrettably turned away. Don't let that happen to you.

My second recommendation would be to order the $100 Omakase option. Apparently the difference between this and the $75 option is the quality of the food; my opinion is, if you're going to eat a dinner of this caliber, why not spend $25 more to get the best?

As far as the food was concerned, I don't know what to tell you except: be prepared to be wowed. Granted, not all of the dishes were mind-blowing, but plenty of them were. Some of my favorites:

Hairy crab: I had never heard of this prior to my visit to Raku, and apparently they only exist in parts of Japan, but the meat was flavorful, and they pre-cut the shell so it's easy for you to scoop out the meat. And the vinegar-based dipping sauce that comes with it is absolutely perfect with the crab.

Sashimi: The tuna, paired with marinated seaweed, was awesome. And the uni was by far the best I've ever had. So rich, so creamy, so buttery... SO GOOD. My wife never had uni and refused to try it because of the way it looked and because she's a texture-eater, but I convinced her to try some, and she ended up liking it. Some day, she will love uni; I'm sure of it.

Bacon-wrapped mushrooms: So simple, yet so delicious. I love the texture of these mushrooms, and when combined with the bacon and a soy sauce-like sauce, it's seriously fantastic. I could pop these in my mouth all day long.

Salmon belly: The salmon was cooked so well (meaning not overcooked and dry), and the skin was perfectly crunchy and salty. Combine that with salmon roe in each bite, and you've got a magical blend of flavors and texture. Popping the roe in your mouth completed the dish so perfectly. Awesome.

Wagyu beef: This was served on a skewer, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and topped lightly with wasabi. When I took my first bite, I was shocked at how tender it was... it melts in your mouth like butter. And the seasoning was just right. 

Each dish came out in a timely manner (although we got a little jammed w/ the crab since it took some time to scoop out all the meat), and the chef did a great job going from the lighter dishes to the richer, more filling ones. And our server, Kazue, was extremely friendly and did a great job explaining each dish to us.

Keep in mind the Omakase menu does change. There were a few items that my friends had told me about, but we didn't get them. I guess we'll just have to keep going back.",K6Z1NU_ofX4yiUqWtV1jNA,6,6,4,dvOeWYOjPyIEmwnkkfKX2A
5514843,2017-09-30,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"On our last evening of our road trip before flying out of LAS, I knew we were going to be craving Japanese food after travelling through smaller towns and cities of Arizona for week. So I made sure to get a reservation in advance. This place is located in a crowded strip mall and the parking lot was already almost full when we arrived around 6p on a weekday. There was also a line of people waiting to get in right when they opened, some with and some without reservations.

They have a large sake list and we needed a lot of help to navigate through it. They let you order half bottles, all you have to do is ask! We ended up getting a half bottle of ""Mirror of Truth"" Masumi Okuden Kanzukuri Junmai. We both ordered the $75 omakase which included their homemade tofu, assorted sashimi, fried sawagani river crab, bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, kobe beef with garlic, kurobuta pork, fried mackerel in a dashi broth with pillowy dumplings, negitoro donburi with zuke nori, and a strawberry ice with condensed milk for dessert. The have a few special sauces and seasonings on the table, however I didn't really get to use them since our dishes were already seasoned well. My favorites were the tofu, sashimi, mackerel with dashi broth and the donburi.

For starters, you have to make a reservation, I suggest a few days in advance because it's a small place. Their sake list is impressive and they offer quite a selection by the glass. I just asked my server for a recommendation, and he steered me in the right direction.

We started with a whole order of the raku tofu.... Tofu has been ruined for me as I will never look at it again the same way. It was creamy, flavorful and mind-blowing. They serve it with a heap of bonito flakes, chive and ginger. They also offer an array of wonderful condiments. A house blended soy sauce (with plum), a hot pepper infused sake condiment, shichimi (a flavorful spice blend) and green tea salt with seaweed and shiitake powder (quite possibly the best salt ever made). Green tea salt + raku tofu = unbelievable!

Next we had some breaded deep fried asparagus. Sounds like nothing special, right? Oh so wrong. Perfectly cooked asparagus breaded with something interesting. (The texture and taste was like those savory glazed asian rice snacks, I'm going to say it was that). Perfectly crunchy.. Perfectly seasoned.. Best aparagus I've ever had hands down. Add some green tea salt and you're in heaven.

Next came some bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms. My friend loved them, but they were my least favorite part of the meal. It's a texture thing..

Make sure to check out the specials. If I had not, I wouldn't have experienced one of the best bites in my life. Iberico pork roasted on the robata grill... For those unfamiliar, Iberico is a spanish pig that roams freely, munching on acorns. Extremely expensive, and hard to find where I'm from. $10/skewer says all. I was seriously not expecting to be this blown away. One bite in, i'm sure my face said it all. We probably sounded like fools, pretty much having foodgasms with each bite. 1) The meat was astonishingly perfectly cooked.. Med rare, some char but not too much. 2) the FLAVOR. Not only was the rich, nuttiness of the meat present, but they had to have brined it or something. It was seasoned throughout.. If they still have this available when you go.... Do yourself a favor.

Next we had the pork cheek. Absolutely wonderful, wish we would have had it before the iberico.. Because nothing could beat that.. So we thought.

Next came our foie gras egg custard. We thought it would simply be that. Nope. Delicately steamed custard, topped with a thin layer of house made dashi and a very thinly sliced piece of duck breast (that, once again, was a perfect MR, given that it was only 1/4 of an inch thick.. Skills). One bite and it brought tears to our eyes it was so good. The UMAMI of that dish was unfathomable. The custard was silky and served at the perfect temperature. The foie was there, but not until the end and it played so well with the other flavors. This was the best part of the meal, hands down.

While eating the custard, our duck with balsamic glaze arrived. We tried a piece, wonderful of course, then mixed the duck with the custard. I even drizzled some balsamic glaze in there... And it got even better.

To finish, we had the kobe beef tendon. Great flavor, smooth. But once again, the texture got me.

Service was on point. We never waited more than 5 minutes in between courses. And he answered all of our questions. 

This was hands down, one of the best meals I have ever had. Oh and guess what? With all that food (with multiples of each) 2 glasses of ($10) sake and a beer it cost us $95 before tip.. Save your money, skip Robuchon come to Raku and enjoy yourself even more!

5529758,2008-05-27,15,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"EDIT 2018: This place is fucking awesome and my FTR doesn't really reflect how I feel about Raku now.  

My wife found out about this place through Mixi which is kind of like a Japanese myspace.  Its only been open for 3 weeks and we've wanted to try another izakaya style place besides Ichiza (which was packed for Memorial Day) so we gave this place a go.

The place is a bit small, not great for groups of over 4 but the atmosphere wasn't bad.  I guess I prefer Jpop over koto music but it was fine.  Their specialty is their yakitori (grilled on a stick) type stuff.  We went w/ the chicken thigh ($2 a piece), wasabi kobe beef ($9), asparagus bacon ($2) and the tsukune which is grilled ground chicken on a stick.  Everything we had tasted awesome.  Not sure what they're putting in their grill for the flavoring but its fantastic and addictive.  

You can definitely tell that the ingredients used here are of higher quality than Ichiza but the menu is a lot smaller and aside from the yakitori, pricier too.  

Ofcourse we weren't full from all the above so we tried some of the rice dishes along with oden (a winter food boiled in a soup..kinda like a hot pot).  My wife got the Tororo don which is gooey potato mixed w/ soy sauce that she loves but I find inedible while I had the ikura don which is salmon roe eggs w/ seaweed on rice.  Both of these cost around $10 a piece and the portions were pretty small.  Just one small bowl of rice w/ the topping.  Definitely disappointed w/ that.  My wife was also bummed that they didn't have natto.  

The oden was tasty though.  We ordered the chikuwa (fish stick), konnyaku and daikon which were all around $1.50-$2 a piece.

They only have Sapporo beer but they do have a nice list of sake, shochu and wines which would make this a nice place for some beverages and small food.  I would also recommend just buying the pitcher of beer at $22 a pop as opposed to the $5 glass if your party plans on drinking at least 4 glasses.  You get a WHOLE lot more w/ the pitcher!!!!!  

The bathroom was funny too as they only have a single unisex stall but they put a bunch of fake flowers on the ceiling w/ a speaker playing bird noises the entire time.  Priceless.  

Overall, I would rate this place 3.5 stars but its closer to 4 than 3.   I am just sticking to the grilled stuff the next time we go back as the rice dish portions are way too overpriced.  A few tables ordered the deep juicy fried chicken ($8) which looked awesome too so maybe we'd get that next time.  They're open til 3am which is cool.  Most patrons there were Japanese..I think I was 1 out of 3 that weren't. 

So yeah..this is a good alternative to Ichiza although I wouldn't say its better...just different.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,19,17,4,wsgxjXuPbmXBtRkWZSlaDw

First I ordered al la carte dishes - Kobe beef liver sashimi, foie gras egg custard, poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe, plus fried ice fish. Then I went crazy and decided I would have their premium $100 9 course omakase.

They also serve the same omakase for $75 but lower quality. I don't know about the $75 but with the $100 the portion was really generous, probably the most generous out of all the omakase places I've been to.

If you come here expecting to find nigiri you wouldn't have any. There was none in the omakase and I don't believe they have it in the menu either.

Honestly I came here for the Kobe beef liver sashimi and I liked it. I haven't found that anywhere else so that's  a nice dish to try if you haven't tried it before.

I think the $75$100 omakase is worth it because of the generous portion and they do include some nice items in there, although some of them were a little salty for my liking. The fluffy cheesecake was nice they also give you green tea to go with it.

The place is really busy you have to make reservations before hand or you won't be able to find a seat walking in. I turned up at 6 o'clock when they open and there were already people inside however the food came out really fast, at times they gave me multiple dishes almost at the same time unlike other places where you have to finish one and they give you the next.",qYIdeVYtCOMjWfzydyuvmg,0,0,3,32JFREr2zvL0jVtgQKMufw

So much cheaper than dining on the strip.  It's in Chinatown - about a $15 cab ride from LV Blvd (including tip).  Not to mention the food is way better than any Japanese food I ever ate on the strip -- or in my LIFE.

Staff was so pleasant and helpful.  We wanted to get our sake on and they came out with 3 different kinds of sake for us to sample before we decided on a bottle.  I forget the name - something with ""blossom"" in the name (should have been called AWESOME blossom), but it was hands down the best sake I've ever had in my life.

You can pretty much close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and it'll be good, which is more or less what we did.  We selected 3 items from the specials board.  I don't know the actual names but one was a yellowtail-like sashimi, abalone, and a kobe beef dish.  Then we selected two skewers - garlic scallops and pork cheek.  I loved everything and I generally don't even eat pork.  Every single plate was licked clean (seriously, we ate all the condiments and garnishes too which the staff giggled at).  Flavors were unique and ingredients were fresh.  You could even tell the difference in the Wasabi which was real Wasabi - not just some horseradish rubbish dyed green.

We left with happy bellies (not food coma) and a nice buzz so we were able to head back to the strip and hit duh club without feeling like we needed to be wheel-barreled in.",dN1AuY5I9Qic_6gsjsXiKg,0,0,5,H4gADA1_SR3A9Oa86PjeqA

We had the yellow tail carpaccio. We also had agedashi tofu, rice cakes (soy sauce and wasabi flavored), and every fois gras dish they had on the menu. It was all spectacular. The grilled fois gras was perfect, the rice in the fois gras don was like no other rice I've ever had and the fois gras custard was a work of art.

This is tucked away in the back of a strip mall.  A really unassuming storefront next to numerous other ""asian"" restaurants.  Once you walk in you are greeted by the staff and realize quickly this is a serious Japanese Robata styled restaurant.  
There is no Sushi per se.  As we perused the menu we noted the vast Sake selection.  We opted for an unfiltered ""white snow"" sake.  Served cold this was very pleasant to sip.  
We couldn't decide what to choose so we all opted for the ""Omakase"" which is the Chef's selection.  

Then the display of the chef's culinary talent came out one by one.  
It was started with home made Tofu served chilled with a wasabi sauce.  Very earthy and delicately yummy.
Followed then by a nigiri platter.  The amberjack was to die for!  
Next was chargrilled alaskan king crab.  Smokey flavor that enhanced the sweetness of the crab.
Then came out the grilled baby barracuda!  Grilled in a swimming pose, the meat was moist and soft.  Tasting very similar to grilled mackerel. (Drooling just thinking about it).
Then they laid out both grilled Kobe beef, Pork, and Ahi Tuna on skewers.  The kobe beef melted in your mouth and was glazed with a little wasabi mustard.  Incredible!
Next was Foie Gras served over rice.  This was the perfect umami flavor that makes Japanese dining so perfect.
Finally we served a home made green tea cheesecake.

5572223,2017-07-26,2,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Vegas is a great place for food, but Raku almost feels out of place because it's so low key. Tucked away in a small strip mall, this unassuming establishment offers up a medley of fresh fish (Omakase), grilled delights and signature tofu. If you're in search of high quality, creative Japanese cuisine, Raku is as good as any you would find in LA, SF or NYC.

Highly Recommended:

Yellow Tail Carpaccio $12 - the fish is incredibly fresh and lightly drizzled with citrus ponzu. This is the perfect appetizer to build the appetite. 

Raku Tofu $3.50/half & $5.50/whole - this is their signature dish and should not be missed. I really like the texture and flavor of the tofu. The presentation is delicate but the flavors are bold and completely satisfying.

Yellow Tail Collar - nicely fried and seasoned. A final pinch of lemon makes this seasonal menu item a great option.

In terms of delicious food, reasonable prices and good service, Raku checks all the boxes. The restaurant is located in Chinatown so expect to drive, cab or Lyft to the location. This place is extremely popular so make reservations (if available) or expect to wait.

Poached Egg w/ Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe has an interesting slimy texture with the diced Mountain Yam in it. You mix them all together to eat it. The Foie Gras Bowl is just heavenly. The rice is mixed with Foie Gras oil, and the Foie Gras is fat and just perfectly cooked. Negitoro sashimi is seasonal today's special. I would definitely order it if they have it available that day. They have the freshest Negitoro! I also order their Ken(square) Salad every time. There's something magical about their salad.

I still remember the very first time I went there, it was after the exhausting 4 hour drive from Phoenix, and I was having a serious headache in that cold winter night, ready to hit the bed.
Didn't know why, but my female friend insisted that we should go down to Chinatown and eat at a restaurant called Raku which was recommended by some of her friends, instead of somewhere nearer on the Strip. Although Chinatown is not far from the Strip at all, it is only a less-than-10-minute-drive, I still felt reluctant to go. 
Since it's Vegas, the time this restaurant opens is a bit different from other regular ones --- from 6PM to 3AM. When we arrived, it was still an hour earlier than their default opening time, we had to wait for an entire hour until we got to get in the place. I was already extremely hungry, tired, and impatient by then. 
As me and my girl friend were entering the restaurant, all the waiters and waitresses turned their heads toward us and shouted out ""welcome to eat at Raku!!"" in Japanese (I learned a few Japanese words in some of the animation I watch). It was a little bit overwhelmed to me at that time, but I got used to it as they have been acted that way to all the customers with the same friendly attitude. The waitress asked if it is the first time we've been there, we said ""yes"", she then began to introduce the menu and the special dishes they have that are very popular.
The restaurant was small but nice and warm, after 6PM, it soon became crowded. The overall lightings were dark with romantic jazz playing in the background, it would certainly be a good place for those who are on a date. There are some regular seats with tables and chairs, but there is also a food bar you can choose to sit, on which you get the chance to watch the chief making some of their special dishes.
We then started to read the menu, there are very many options we could made in four categories: Appetizers, Robata Grill, Rice Noodle and Soup, and Dessert. My friend and I each picked 6-7 of the dishes as we were told by the friendly waitress that the portion of their dishes are relatively smaller compare with other regular American restaurants. We've only waited for less than five minutes for the first dish of their special tofu to come, it was really quick and was special enough to have satisfied my Asian stomach. During the entire meal, the waitresses would bring in one dish at a time, and bring in another dish only after we have finished the previous one as they believe that food should be eaten in such orders so the customers would get better tastes out of it.
We've stayed there for an hour and a half, as I told one of the waitresses that we actually just drove here all the way from Phoenix, she soon managed to give us free dessert. How nice that was! 
Finally, we were checking out of the place, the price for the food is totally reasonable and worth its delicious taste, as I mentioned above, me and my friend have ordered over 12 dishes, the price was still something under $100. As we were leaving, I saw a long line of people waiting outside to eat.
I think it's clear enough why I love this restaurant so much. If you ever get in Vegas, try it out, Raku is definitely worth your time and money!",bdAhJD3uuhhlUuiGkaWHnQ,0,0,5,TmQpaLXkJscwwM6TzK1POg

The dishes that stood out most were the garlic skirt steak, the house made tofu, the apple marinated lamb chop, the foie steamed egg duck broth with udon, and the green tea soba with poached egg.  The flavors and preparation for these items were fantastic.  I personally appreciated the tofu and the soba noodles most because they taste like they were skillfully made from scratch.  The tofu had so much depth and richness.  They provide you with green tea salt and some house made soy sauce to sprinkle or dip the tofu in.  It was so simple yet flavorful.  A part of me wanted to order  tofu to go and pour some honey over it.  I imagine it would also make a good dessert tofu.  The soba had a very nice texture and the green tea flavor worked well.

Their homemade tofu is always a must - you can get it half ""agedashi"" and half served cold.

Skewers:  Salmon, pork cheek, tendon...drooooool....

If they have it on the specials menu, you must get the ice fish - deep fried whole tiny fishies. When sprinkled with the lemon wedge and the green tea house salt, it's AMAZING.  

I tried to get them to sell me their salt (green tea powder, roasted salt and shitake powder is what the waitress told me) but apparently it's proprietary.  Poo!  Well...that just means we have to keep going back to have more.

He certainly didn't say good bye either. It was as if he didn't want to work there. We couldn't understand his cold and unfriendly demeanor. I swear he never smiled once and was not one bit friendly.

The staff responded well to the challenge of having 2 diners arriving slightly tardy.  We had the 75$-level omakase.  This afforded us a stunning parade of 10 dishes, including (but not in exact order):

- house-made tofu (raved over even by a noisy meatatarian)
- sashimi - very fresh, very thin, very cleansing to the palate
- ankimo (the only dish passed over by our dining entourage... if the server had not referred to it as monk fish liver as well as ankimo, he never would have known and would have enjoyed it)
- Popeye salad (this was a requested item from when we were making the reservations).  This is one of the best applications of spinach (bacon-y goodness at the bottom) that we really wanted to reprise last year's visit.
- scallop, served with shell.  Delicate, perfectly prepared
- Yakitori cherry tomatoes
- Kobe beef Yakitori with a stripe of wasabi -- and yes, they proudly showed us their Kobe beef importation license (at least, they did last year), so it wasn't ""American Kobe,"" a/k/a Wagyu
- a miniature negitoro don (Betty's favorite).  She kept saying it was a ""simple"" dish, but I think that the amount of work in dicing and seasoning this preparation perfectly makes it much more than simple.  Simple concept, expert complex execution
- Yakitori pork cheek
- Fried ice fish (I think, this part of the notes was smudged)

all this followed by a pear sorbet w/condensed milk at the bottom of the bowl.

We had to show off the main rest room to the folks we dragged along who had never been before -- complete with fish tank.  It's not only clean, but visually stunning.  

As Charlie (the noisy meatatarian and erstwhile foodie) says (and we all agree), ""they respect the star product, doing just enough to enhance your enjoyment of it, never overpowering it.""

5674067,2010-04-10,3,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"It's not fair to Raku that I come from California.  My exposure to and experience with izakaya restaurants is varied enough that I know 5 star fare when I eat it and Raku is close--so very close--but lost points on service and price.

The kobe beef tendon and grilled duck with balsamic soy sauce sold out.  It was 7:30PM on a Monday night and the place is open until 3AM.  Since we were severely disappointed, the waitress pushed the specials of the evening on us.

We ordered the bluefin tuna (toro), the unagi (cooked in two styles, grilled and with salt and pepper), and the grilled salmon cheek (kama).  From the regular menu, we also got the homemade tofu served in two different ways: cold with green onions and ginger (hiyayakko) and sitting in hot broth after being fried (agedashi).  We also had the grilled pork cheek (kurobuta), a couple of chicken wings, and chicken and egg served over a bowl of rice (oyakodon).  For dessert, the green tea creme brulee.

The toro was amazing and should be the #1 reason why you come here.  It was soft, smooth, and slightly sweet, as perfectly fresh toro is supposed to taste.  $25 for 6 huge slabs?!  Yes, please!

The homemade tofu is reason #2 why I'd come back.  I prefer the agedashi style just because I prefer hot tofu over cold, but both styles were enjoyable.  I particularly liked how flavorful the broth was.

The unagi was a total rip-off.  $30 for 6 small, bony pieces.  Grilled was better than S&P but neither were things I'd order again and I strongly suggest that you don't either.

The salmon kama was okay but not something I'd order here ever again because almost every good Japanese restaurant in California makes it better and for a cheaper price.  That isn't to say it's terrible, though.  If you've NEVER had salmon kama ever and you can't get it where you're from, it doesn't hurt to try it here.

The kurobuta and chicken wings were salty, greasy, and fatty, as expected.  Would have been great with beer, which unfortunately we lacked.  I'm sure we would have had a better experience with the meat had we ordered something like the foie gras or a kobe beef item.

The oyako (which means 'parent' and 'child', referring to the chicken and egg, respectively) is classic Japanese comfort food and I loved it.  Tender chicken pieces nestled in a bowl of warm, soft rice that's gooey from egg yolk made this reason #3 why I'd come back.  For some, this dish is about as special as fried rice, but if you love both as much as I do, I'd recommend getting it!

Lastly, the green tea creme brulee was mediocre but come on, you don't go to a place like this for a fabulous dessert.  Try Nobu or a French or Italian restaurant if you want a dessert that will knock your socks off.

Now let me talk about the sub-par service.  We ordered tea (which, surprise surprise, cost us $) but the waitresses rarely refilled our tea no matter how many times we asked.  And when they did, they'd refill it 1/4th of the way.  The tea, by the way, is roasted green tea and is amazing so I suggest ordering it even if you do end up getting sake or beer.  But know your rights--don't be afraid to ask for more and demand that they refill it!  That's what you're paying for, after all!

Another waitress also charged us an extra $50 out of sheer stupidity.  When we discovered the discrepancy between the amount listed on the bill and the amount we were charged, she tried to defend herself by saying the restaurant was too dark.  Try going to a lighted area, then?  A bill isn't something you 'guess'...if you have a question about what is written, ask us.  Sigh.

With all this said, Raku is as good as a non-sushi Japanese restaurant as you will find in Sin City and an eye-opening experience for people who think Japanese cuisine is all sushi and sashimi.

Thank you for providing great food and giving my friend a great smile. Having known my friend for more than two years, I have never seen her so happy before. This speaks a lot to your well-executed, high-quality food. 

My friend was amazed by the grilled salmon belly. According to her, the salmon skin was as crispy as a piece of bacon. The belly meat was fresh and smooth. She rated the salmon belly 9 out of 10, the highest rating that she had given to any dish yet. 

Foie gras Yakitori was my friend's second favorite dish at your restaurant. She loved the deep flavor and the creamy texture of the foie gras. If the cholesterol of foie gras was not high, she would have ordered another piece. 

Her only disappointment at Raku was that some pieces of the Kobe beef liver were slightly overcooked and tough. 

Raku, you not only made my friend happy, but you also made me felt satisfied with my food. I adored the different sauces, spices and side ingredients that are used for Raku's tofu. The various combinations of ginger, soy sauce, sea salt, and green onion made me felt as if I had three different tofu dishes. 

I wish my grilled eggplant was more flavorful - I had to add an extensive amount of shichimi, green tea sea salt, soy sauce and katsuobushi to enhance the flavor of the eggplant. Nonetheless, I was impressed by the creamy texture of the eggplant. 

My friend and I decided to give you four stars instead of five stars because neither of us was able to reach the host when we tried to make reservations via the phone. We ended up waiting in front of the restaurant forty minutes in advance, and luckily became the first customers of the day. 

Raku, you are awesome. Keep up the good work!

Yours,

At $100 price can't be beat for the quality and taste. It's ALOT of food! It leaves your mouth watering and tummy FULL! For couples, might i recommend sharing one omokase order then adding a few items from the menu to ensure you get to try their beautiful omokase dishes without wasting food.

5745233,2015-02-02,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I'm from the Midwest area, which authentic Japanese dining is very limited. Everytime I visit Vegas ( at least twice per year), I would make a reservation for Raku. The restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). Rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  I've been to Raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. Sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. 

Skewers: The price on the menu is for one skewer. Skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from Japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.

Kobe tendon - Rcmd sharing this skewer with others. The tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. Don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. I would just take a bite of it for sampling. 

Kobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. It was good, but it was okay. Maybe it was too well done, I prefer medium rare. Personally, I think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.

kobe beef outside skirt $8- One of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. Not too overdone and just right. 

beef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, 

Kurobuta Pork cheek - Very tasty. Love it.

chicken - I always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,

yellowtail $7 - Good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. It was flaming delicious. 

eggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. It was not spectacular, but average.

Regular food item:
Raku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. I usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. My usual appetizer that i order every time.

Udon with foie gras custard soup - The udon is served cold in a basket and I think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. The foie gras is infused in the egg custard. You dip the cold udon into the warm foie custard soup. Sooo hearty... Unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.

Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. It's all raw and raw. The taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. The texture was slimy Been there, done that.. ill try something else next time

Juicy deep fried chicken - fried chicken and the chicken was juicy and tender. 

Grilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. Cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.

Daily Chef's special:
rock fish - The whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and EXTREMELY fresh. My friend and I finished the whole fish. Soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  It's very reasonable for $45. Later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. This is one of my favorite fish.

wagyu beef sukiyaki - Do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? Most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  Raku does it just like how it's done in Tokyo! The vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. The waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. Love IT and i wish there was more meat to it.

Overall, one of my favorite robata grill. After the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. The plaza that this restaurant is located is a Foodie paradise. In this plaza, there is Sweets Raku, Monta Ramen, Kung fu tea, Snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, Japanese curry, and Japanese Italian noodle (not sure of the name).",9Xc7vla9JStodqfaYdJTow,3,0,5,JTEuUfuzWUawpVIPE2pCwg

Now, my taste buds have evolved and it's constantly searching for more. More what, you say? More flavor, more originality, more creativity. Just more. Well, I got some of that here at Raku.

I booked reservations for Raku at 9pm, but when we showed up a half hour early, they seated us after just a few minutes of setting up our table. I had seen the menu online and after reading reviews, but when you're actually in the restaurant reading the menu in your hands, it's tough to stop yourself from over-ordering.

We settled on the following:

- Kanpachi sashimi
- Tofu: half agedashi and half Raku tofu
- Juicy fried chicken
- Tsukune: ground chicken on skewers
- Kobe beef filet with wasabi sauce
- Suji: Kobe beef tendon
- Foie gras with soy glaze
- Buttered scallop with soy sauce
- Tanuki: portobello mushroom 
- Asparagus okaki
- Green tea creme brulee

From top to bottom, everything we had was excellent. There was not one dish that was disappointing and failed to deliver. Although some were more memorable than others. The kanpachi was from the specials menu that the waitress brought over on a board, and the fish was so smooth and buttery. 

The must-order item of Raku, their handmade tofu, was just so good. It should turn any tofu hater into a believer. I liked how they offered half of each, with different preparations. I preferred the agedashi tofu, because it just has so many different components that accentuate the tofu.

The juicy fried chicken was unbelievable. It sounds so simple, looks so simple, yet I can bet that the preparation was not simple. It was the most juicy, moist, and flavorful chicken I have ever had. Along with the crispy skin and subtle dressing on the bed of spinach leaves, it was truly a culinary work of art.

Other memorables include the buttered scallop, kobe beef tendon, and foie gras. The scallop is literally one scallop, brilliantly presented on a scorching hot shell. It oozed with big-time flavor, and I could've eaten about a dozen of them. The kobe beef tendon, when eaten with the kobe beef filet was an excellent combo. The foie gras was ultra-rich and so decadent. 

The green tea creme brulee was a perfect way to end the meal. It wasn't too sweet, and the green tea flavor shined all the way through. Service was friendly, quick, and efficient -- definitely made us feel at home somewhere in Japan. Raku can be categorized as a more upscale izakaya, and it's a restaurant definitely worth visiting off the Strip.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,15,11,5,QazDnXPrQqTu1qtEOICpAQ

Me and my bf went here for thanksgiving dinner.
We ordered Premium Omakase $100/pp ,tbh it's the best of the best!
Usually sushi at the US won't have an authentic Japanese experience due to the creative Avocado/Lobster/lots of creamy sauce/not very decent rice....they add on(even at the high end Michelin restaurant).And this kind of misunderstanding of SUSHI is hard to shake.
But Raku made me believe that somewhere in the US still have a place their chef take sushi seriously!
1.Fresh Oyster with Caviar , price aren't shown on the menu
2.Foie Gras Don $18.5/pp 
3.Assorted Choice of Sashimi (Blue Fin Tuna,Yellowtail Carpaccio and other stuff I'm not sure the name) , price aren't shown on the menu
4.Raku's Tofu $3.5/2=$1.75/pp 
5. Crispy Asparagus Okaki $5/pp 
6.Fried Ice Fish $8.5 /pp 
7.Kobe Beef fillet with Wasabi $12 /pp 
8.Iberico Pork $10 /pp 
9.Green Tea Creme Brûlée &Fluffy Cheesecake $6 for each
We also add three more dishes including:
-Butter Sautéed Scallop with Soy Sauce $7
-Kurobuta Pork Cheek $4.25
-Duck with Balsamic Soy Sauce $4.5
I would say ALL of them was great,esp Foie Gras Don and Rakus Tofu.
Here is one more tip to offer:DO NOT ORDER OMAKASE.
I checked every single price of the food we had at Raku just for the purpose of writing reviews.And I found the Omakase was a bit tricky because you might have the chance to save more money when ordering yourself instead of just taking the Omakase.(you can see that actually their Omakase is quite similar from day to day in other people's reviews)
The first and the third one of the Omakase aren't on the menu so you don't know how much are they.
However,you can get their prices from deductions.The remaining balance after minus all the other seven dishes will be $38.25,which means the value of these two dishes we aren't so sure about will be a total $38.25/pp and $76.5 for two ppl.
As you can see,I doubt a sashimi plate and two small caviar oysters would cost this high.",AjM7wo8X2GFkIE_bBv7Uyw,0,0,5,akLtjzGQTrSZYoNOH52anA
5766426,2017-11-10,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"We decided to come here one of the nights we were in Vegas because it looked like a unique dining experience. We had to call and make reservations by phone, they don't do opentable. I made my reservation about 2 weeks ahead of time and got the time slot of 7:00 that I wanted. While we were in Vegas I realized I booked it on a night we already had plans so I had to call and reschedule for another night. They happily accommodated me on a different day, I just had to book it about an hour  earlier at 6:00 which wasn't a huge deal.

We took an uber there since it was a good  distance from our hotel and not very walkable because you would have to cross a highway. We arrive 15 minutes early and waited outside cause they weren't open yet. Once we were seated we looked over the menu and were a bit overwhelmed. I was expecting our waitress to explain how the menu worked but she just told us the specials. I asked questions like how many of each dish people typically get because I had no idea. She said it depends, but I can always order more later. She was cordial but not overly friendly. So my husband and I ended up ordering 2 appetizers and about 6 or 8 different items from the robata grill. 

My husband wanted to order pork belly but they were out, that was disappointing. We ordered the fried  ice fish and poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe. The poached egg with sea urchin had a lot of different flavors going on and was good but an acquired taste. The ice fish was ok but not amazing. From the robata grill we ordered pork cheek, pork intestines, scallop,  duck, Kobe beef skirt steak, Kobe beef tendon, and eggplant. My favorites were definitely the Kobe beef skirt steak and the balsamic duck. Both of these had amazing flavor to it. I liked the scallop as well but it said it was $7 on the menu but then turned out to be $9 when the check came. If I had known that then I would have ordered something else. $9 is a little expensive for 1 scallop. Everything came out pretty fast, they brought out 2 dishes at a time. We did have to wait a little longer for the tendon though. The tendon was probably my least favorite also, I wish they would have brought one of the other dishes out last instead of that. We said afterwards we probably should have ordered a couple other more expensive dishes, I should have ordered the Kobe beef filet with wasabi, everyone was saying it was good. We ended up ordering the eggplant at the end because we wanted to try a vegetable and everything we ordered was all meat. It was interesting, different than I expected. It had a lot of ginger on it, but was good.

One thing that was bothersome was that I ordered the Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe....I did not realize it also came with a golf ball sized amount of grated mountain yam.  Right when the waitress set it down I asked her if that was mountain yam...she said ""yes""  and I said ""Oh no, I'm allergic to mountain yam!""   She didn't seem to care and walked away.  Now if the description mention mountain yam, I would not have ordered this dish...but it didn't.  I know it's not right for me to expect that they would just take the dish back, but I did hope that they would have the decency to do so. We left it pretty much untouched and when she came to pick up the dish, not a word was uttered.  =/

5769960,2018-06-01,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I didn't want to come here.  The only reason I did is because my friend is moving ""forever away"" next month and we've started his ""goodbye tour"" with a list of restaurants he wants to go to.  Raku was on that list, even though I had dashed his dreams when we first met 7 months ago by trash talking this place.  

Do I still think that it's overpriced?  Yes.

HOWEVER... having dinner here last night I can certainly understand why there are people who love the place and people who don't.  

The people who don't are probably used to more creative food.  ""Foodies"" who love to Instagram and try all the new fun things that pop up.  They want clashes and symphonies of flavors that burst from each bite.  I'm one of these people.  I love new ideas and creativity.  I'll pay a premium for this, as so many of us do.  

The people who do love this place can see it for what it is.  Pure, simple Japanese food.  No, you're not going to be wowed by something crazy (unless you get the flaming wagyu, then watch your eyebrows) but what you are going to get is a naked dish that only relies on the freshness and subtlety of few ingredients.  This is Japanese cuisine.  I think I had forgotten that.  

Here's my Ratatouille moment:

The poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe ($15 because of the Hokkaido uni).  Just like the movie, I had a flashback to my childhood.  It's exactly how I remember Japan to taste like.  It's the reason I was such a huge Japanophile when I was younger.  I was so enthralled by the place the 2 weeks I spent there, I didn't call my family once.  Not even to tell them I got there safe.  I even forced the hand of my junior year Dean to allow me to take Japanese even though it wasn't on the curriculum at my college, that's how in love I was.

That sort of powerful sense memory can do a lot.  If you are making those memories for the first time by coming here and eating this delicious food, I can't think of a better place to start.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,1,0,4,stcN6_-BZvWu3YxBzAp2Ew

I am going to dive right into the things we tried.  Everybody else has already mentioned everything else, so we'll go with my opinions on a few things that I still clearly remember:

+ Fried homemade tofu... bomb!  This was amazing.  We started with the homemade (nonfried) tofu and this easily 1 upped it! (It was double the price though)

+Pork ear:  So good, perfectly cooked so it was nice and crunchy.  Texture was perfect, so good...

+Kobe beef tendon:  When you hear tender, you imagine tender.  Now imagine something even more tender yet still has enough texture to keep you happy and knowing that it's tendon.  Amazing!

+Yellowtail carpaccio:  REALLY fresh, tasty, not fishy at all!  The dip it comes with is very strong so be conservative about it.  You don't want to overpower the star!

+Hamachi sashimi:  It was on their special board.  This was amazing.  $20 for 6 pieces of sashimi.  Expensive.  BUT WORTH IT!  It was a nice and fatty cut of fish.  Definitely worth it.

+Kobe fillet with garlic: This was good, but almost not worth it.

+Duck with balsamic vinegrette: Amazing.  Duck was prefect and the vinegrete complimented the duck so well.

+Pork cheeks: I can't believe I initially forgot this!!!  This is my friend's must have here.  SO good!  Pure pork fat with tender meat.  God.  I want to go back, now.

-xxx wrapped in bacon:  Eh.  This has been overdone.  Even though it tastes good, I'd rather get it at cheaper places (tastes the same).  I'd get the other menu items before gettign this stuff.

5806976,2012-10-10,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"***The Menu***
This restaurant's formal name is ""Aburiya Raku,"" which means ""Charcoal Grill House Enjoyment."" Indeed, a large portion of the menu is devoted to robatayaki, a form of Japanese charcoal grilling. However, the menu doesn't stop there. Also available are soups, rice dishes, sushi and more. Lastly, Raku has offers kaiseki meals -- like a tasting menu, with a Japanese bent.

Raku's specials deserve special mention. There are usually a dozen or so specials listed on a small chalk board. Your server should go over these with you. If not, be sure to ask, as these are some of the best things available. You could easily make a meal from the specials alone.

Items arrive as they're ready. There may be a long wait for an item; on the other hand, several items may arrive almost together. When I first went to Raku, I was under the impression it was best to order just a few things at a time, but lately I've been told I might as well order everything at once.

***The Atmosphere***
Raku is fairly small, with seating for less than 50 people, plus 5 at the bar. It fills up quickly after opening time.

Raku is also very plain - not in a bad way, so perhaps a better adjective is ""spare."" The staff is Japanese; their English may be hard to understand, but they're polite and patient.

***The Food***
I've eaten at Raku a number of times, and have never been disappointed. Here are some highlights:
**Home made tofu half & half. Even if you're not a huge tofu fan, order this. It can easily be shared by two or three people but, pig that I am, I always manage to finish it myself. The tofu is prepared two ways: (1) fried, in broth: a revelation! Great broth: rick, flavorful. Gently fried tofu amazingly had its own flavor.  (2) served fresh - creamy and tasty. Surprisingly good this way, especially with a dash of green tea salt or aged soy sauce. Overall, excellent. This was listed as a special, but has been available every time I asked.
**Foie gras with glazed soy robatayaki. A large piece of liver, similar in taste and texture to seared foie gras. As you'd expect, delicious!
**Soft custard omelet with scallop. It turned out to be a large portion of soft egg - vaguely like scrambled eggs, but with better flavor - in a small amount of strong but not salty broth. My description isn't the greatest, but the dish was very good.

[---the items that follow are specials, but many of them seem to reappear---]
**Blue fin tuna. 4 pieces standard type; 5 pieces toro (from collar instead of belly). Both were excellent; toro was especially good.
**Live uni. Served in the shell, the roe was of course very good. Underneath was a broth flavored with more sea urchin, plus noodles and a little bit of salmon roe. Both tasty and fun.
**Gindara saikyo yaki. This translates to grilled sablefish, but there seems to be some confusion in naming, so it's conceivable it might also be called black cod (although sablefish is not a true cod). In any case, it's mighty tasty! It consisted of a good size slice of firm, white, fatty (in a good way) fish, with a sweet glaze. If it's available, order it.
**Whole unagi. Grilled. Half plain with sea salt (eat with soy and wasabi); half with bbq sauce. Better than normal.
**Live soft shell crab. Prepared tempura style, the chef got it just right: a very thin layer of crispy batter, covering juicy and flavorful crab.
**Ayu kanroni. A small-to-medium-fish, served whole, boiled in soy sauce, sugar and something else; eat the head, fins, skin, everything. Interesting - a bit sweet for my taste, but interesting.
**Seafood with bonito guts. An assortment of diced raw fish, salmon roe, uni, and bonito guts. It was a little salty, but quite good - not nearly as exotic as it sounds.
**Grilled yellowtail with ground yam. My first taste didn't seem special, but the more I ate the more I liked it. It was rich, and had a small amount of strongly flavored sauce. The ground yam was a good foil. Overall, it got a surprising very good rating.
**Sawagani. 6 flash fried crabs. Tasty; a fun snack. So much better than Sushisamba!
**Kodai. This might be a young porgy, but don't count on my translation. It was a small whole fish, deep fried, then served in broth; pretty plain. It won't knock your socks off, but if you want something simple, it's worth a try.
**Grilled Kobe beef tongue. Obviously not true Kobe beef, but I'll save that rant for another day. It was very fatty, and only a little chewy. Odd, but good.

***Summary***
If you haven't strayed far from sushi bars, Raku will be a new experience. Even more importantly, it offers some of the best Japanese food around. It's my favorite off-Strip restaurant, and is well worth the effort to get there. Reservations are a must.

***The Bill***
The cost will vary dramatically, depending upon what you order, and how much you figure. If you're careful, you can spend $50 per person, plus drinks and tip. If you splurge, figure $75 - $100, or even more for the highest priced kaiseki meals.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,2,1,5,hx-WPocBknrU3K6TjL7zAw

5812556,2016-07-19,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"How do I explain how good the Japanese food at Raku is? Well, for starters, I would say that Raku is like an overachieving student. Not only does the student get A's, the student puts extra effort to get that A+. Mind you, many of their portions are really tiny, so you need to probably get multiple pieces to share. I'd highly recommend pretty much sampling most of their robata grill items. In particular, the Enoki Mushroom Wrapped with Bacon was really good, as well as the pork cheek. Also, I don't particular like liver, but their Kobe Beef Liver Sashimi was really good. The liver is served raw. You have to douse it with garlic powder or soy sauce, and dip it in the oil that they provide on the side. Reservations are must for Raku since this restaurant is tiny. When I made the reservation, the lady over the phone told me that they have a 2-hour time limit to eat. Luckily, we did finish our dinner within the 2-hour limit. Perhaps the shopping center it is in isn't the best, but the food surely is. You may get confused as to where Raku is since there is also a Raku Sweets store located in the same shopping center as the Raku Japanese Grill Restaurant.

Discovering Raku is like learning how to play Craps for the first time and winning a ton of money at the same time!  I certainly felt like a winner after having dined at Raku ... and much like my first experience with the game of Craps ... I cannot wait to go back and play / eat some more!

Raku is best known for their tapas style dishes that consist mostly of high-quality meat on skewers grilled over ""Japanese charcoal"".  The food was outstanding ... and we certainly tried as many small dishes as we can possibly fit into our stomachs the night we visited.  A couple of my favorites included the following:  bacon wrapped asparagus, poached egg with uni and salmon roe, kobe beef liver, live uni with udon, fried tofu in hot broth, and the grilled foie gras.  The home-made tofu in hot broth was truly amazing - I would definitely say that it was the best preparation of tofu that I have ever had ... it'll take the Pepsi challenge against any other tofu on the planet any ol' day of the freakin' week - that's for sure. The live uni (that was alive up until a few seconds before they serve it to you on the plate) was equally as good especially when mixed with the thin udon noodles.  Lastly ... who would've thought that foie gras would taste so amazingly good coming out of a Japanese restaurant ... certainly not I.

There are so many great restaurants that are popping out in Vegas that I find it difficult to come back for a second visit despite how good my first experience was.  Bouchon for breakfast is certainly an exception and Raku will soon fall into that category.

Special: Blue Fin Tuna Japan $35 was good and delicious, prepared with some salt and seaweed but oh so delicious and cleansing to the palette. 

Poached Eggs w/uni and Ikura $9 was pretty good.  The consistency is one of a kind with a crunch yet gooey consistency.   

Juicy Deep Fried Chicken $10 was probably by far my favorite dish and always a must.  One bite and you will be hooked.  I love this dish so much i could probably order another one

Enoki Mushroom with Bacon $6 pretty small so order 2 if your going to share, but the consistency is amazing 

Kurobuta Pork Cheek $4.25 is as always fatty and delicious

5830782,2016-03-24,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"Fantastic meal at Raku with my wife and in-laws. We didn't go for the omakase menu because everyone's not 100% adventurous, and it also would have cost a good bit more. The 4 of us got away with a bit over $300 with tip.

Our waitress was fantastic and had great recommendations. We were also lucky to be seated in a little private-booth room. The last time we'd come to Vegas, I hadn't been able to get a reservation, so I'm happy we made it in this time. I'd visited years before and definitely wanted to return.

Here's what we had. The food is brought out from cold to hot.

Raku's tofu (house-made)
The tofu, which they make, was almost like a soft, creamy cheese. Great flavor and texture, also comes with bonito shavings, ginger, etc for toppings.

Tuna & yellowtail sashimi salad
Tasty, sashimi over a spinach salad, with a spicy mayo dressing. Good, but it was a little easy to lose the fish.

Yellowtail carpaccio
Very, very delicious. Pieces are dabbed with a pickled yuzu sauce or a spicy daikon sauce, both of which are spicy. A bit much for my wife, but I loved it.

Poached egg w/uni & ikura
Also contains okra, so is a pretty slimy dish, though tasty. I thought I would like it more than I did. Good, though.

O-toro (O-damn!)
O-toro was really amazing. Ate with a dab of wasabi and soy-sauce seasoned seaweed. Very good.

Duck with balsamic soy sauce
This was too fatty for my wife, but not for me! Very good flavor, definitely worth it.

Butter-sauteed scallop with soy sauce
This was delicious as well. The scallop texture is interesting, as it's grilled and firm on one side but then becomes soft/raw as it goes through. The butter sauce is suuper good.

Enoki mushroom with bacon
I enjoyed this so much, I bought another serving. Great savory combo.

Asparagus with bacon
Aspargus was perfectly grilled, another delightful dish.

Steamed foie gras egg custard (OMG)
This was my favorite, even over the o-toro. Such creamy, delicate, savory egg custard, with a little piece of duck on top. So good, do not miss ordering this.

Japanese fried chicken
Good, but not revelatory. The chicken is fried and kind of wrapped around itself.

Grilled Iberico pork
I was really excited for this but a bit let down. Good, but I've been eating the cured Iberico pork from Costco (go buy it now!) and expected a greater depth of flavor that wasn't there.

Agedashi tofu (house-made)
Fried tofu in broth, this was also good. I did like the purity of the plain tofu better, but this was good.

Kurobuta pork belly
This had lots of tender fatty flavor, but I wanted a bit more depth of other flavors. Comes in a broth with sauteed spinach, I think I needed to add some chili pepper or something but failed to.

Grilled rice ume ball in broth
So much ume (pickled plum)! A tasty way to end the meal.

Sake sampler
Enjoyed the $20 sampler of 3 sakes. My taste does run to the super-light daiginjos, of which one was included, but a good price and fun combo.

Will absolutely be back in the future. Open late, from 6pm to 3am, our reservation was at 9pm. Make your reservation today!",gZ2vJkhyJZVbWAu59x1Rww,0,0,5,r68Cukq_v4Vh0rLHCtLRmg

5863649,2015-12-31,8,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!  

I first heard about this place about two years through a former coworker of my wife and fellow Yelper, Eric B.  He told us this place makes its own tofu and its Agedashi Tofu is an absolute must.  Since then I've been arranging trips to Vegas just to try this place out.  Unfortunately, my last two attempts failed because I kept getting sick just few days before my trip.  This time I was determined to make it whether I was sick or not.  Strangely enough I was still sick but it didn't stop me from enjoying one of the most enjoyable meals of my life.

Everything about this place is unique and well put together.  It's an intimate setting with clean, modern decor.  It has an upscale look even though it's more of an izakaya style establishment.  It's sort of like the Asian version of Animal (in LA).  Most of the items are appetizer portions with few full size options.  Most of the items my wife and I tried didn't look too complicated but its choice of quality ingredients and perfect cooking technique made each item stand out.  Raku even has its own condiments at each table with detailed description of each.  Raku's Green Tea Salt, Soy Sauce, Yagenbori Shichimi, and Koregusu were all very unique.

Fuefuki Dai (type of snapper fish) prepared two ways.  This was one of the specials for the day.  We got one as sashimi and the other portion was grilled.  The fish was extremely fresh. I think it was still alive when it was cooked because it was bent when it was served to us.  It looked like the fish was fighting for its dear life as it was being cooked.  Poor thing.  Sad but delicious.  Even without adding any seasoning the fish was flavored perfectly in both versions.

Pork Ear.  This was great with Raku's Green Tea Salt and Koregusu. The spicy pepper and sake in Koregusu helped balance out the fat from the pork ear.  The flavor was quite good with three different textures to keep it interesting.

Foie Gras with Glazed Soy Based Sauce.  I'm not a fan of foie gras in general but I still ordered it since I saw several people rave about this dish.  It's a great dish if you like the taste and texture of foie gras. It just wasn't my thing.  However, it was better than foie gras I had in the past at other places.

Agedashi Tofu. Now this is the dish I came for and it definitely lived up to the expectation.  Excellent texture and taste, and the sauce that accompanied the tofu was great as well.  I always thought tofu tasted bland and boring but this one proved me wrong.  This one had much more depth and flavor.  

Butter Sauteed Scallop with Soy Sauce.  It was cooked to perfection and even the soy sauce was incredible. I drank some of the leftover soy sauce afterward because it was so good.

Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi.  What a perfect combination.  The beef was cooked to perfection because it was super tender and tasty, and the wasabi added just enough heat to balance out the fat. I've had Kobe beef before but none quite like this.  The others taste like impostors in comparison to the ones served here.  

Juicy Deep Fried Chicken.  It was basically like chicken karage but less batter and more chicken.  It's called juicy for a reason - IT'S JUICY.  This was the most tender/juicy chicken I ever had.  The flavor was good just the way it was.  It seemed like they soaked the chicken in sake or rice wine vinegar.  This actually looked like a full order because the portion was much bigger than other items we tried.

Wagyu Sukiyaki.  This was another one of the special items for the day.  This was a full size meal, not appetizer portion.  The Wagyu beef was absolute heaven.  It was so tender and soft even when it was cooked completely.  The sukiyaki broth was sweet and salty with added flavors from onion and fragrant green leaves (which I do not know the name of).

The menu is extensive, but what I learned from my first visit, is to stick with any dishes made with house tofu and anything with Kobe or Wagyu beef.  

The service seemed inflexible when I called to make a reservation.  The person who took my call said we had to finish our meal within two hours and they can only hold the reservation for no more than 15 minutes past our reservation time. However, the actual service during our dinner was friendly and attentive.  Someone constantly came by to refill our tea, and everyone was helpful in explaining the menu.

My wife and I had such a positive experience here, we want to make it a tradition to return every year around this time to celebrate our birthdays.",LGa1GmTItb4bu6HI7KPKfA,11,9,5,Yz-4GKyF-x1mwgcUkEn52g

5867946,2016-04-29,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"It's been a while since my last review but I have to write one after visiting this restaurant and I'll get to the main reason at the very end of this review.  Stay tuned because you will most likely be amazed like I was.

First off, don't get this mixed up with Raku sweets because it's Raku Grill as the Uber driver dropped us off at Raku Sweets, which was the wrong spot, but the grill is hidden in the back corner.  The restaurant is very small, dark, but very authentic and clean, because the folks working here are Japanese but speak English fluently unlike the wannabe non-Japanese pretenders.  

Second is the food...the poached egg uni with ikura is extremely unique.  If you don't like gooey and slimy texture in your mouth, then this may not be for you, but if you can handle the gooeyness and sliminess texture, this is a must try as it's delicious!  I like trying unique delicious dishes.  The Raku tofu & wagyu sashimi was good but not phenomenal.  Now onto the fois gras...the bowl and the seared was phenomenal, but the custard was meh.  Fois gras bowl is with rice, lettuce, & seared fois gras.  If you don't want rice and just more fois gras, just get the seared fois gras.

Third, the price.  The dishes are cheaper than they are in San Francisco!  For example, the chicken skewers (thigh, skin, etc.) were $3.50 & less.  Seared fois gras was $18.50 vs. San Francisco's Isa restaurant for $21+ but I guess the difference is for the cost of the brioche.  Total, including tip, was $130 for two, which good normal sushi in San Francisco usually costs me $130-$150 without fois gras.

Lastly the main reason for this review...drum roll please!  Bum bum bum bum bum....the BATHROOM!  WTF you ask?  Well, let me tell you...they have a freakin bidet!!!!  This is the first and only restaurant I've ever been to that has a bidet!  Even Gary Danko and other high end restaurants in San Francisco don't have bidets!  ALSO, they have a nice fish tank built into the wall inside the bathroom!  However, you won't be able to enjoy it unless you are squatting on the bidet.  Not that I was squatting but noticed it after I turned around.  So because of the fish tank and the most important part...the bidet in the bathroom, I had to post a review of this restaurant.

Were I a resident, I might rate it a 4 because of price, crowded quarters, and long waits for tables. But compared to the strip, the prices and the taste seemed heaven-sent.

I went here because I had seen the tofu touted on one of those ""Best Places I've Ever Eaten..."" kind of shows. So my expectations were high. I will confess that I liked the Agedashi Tofu, but I didn't find it as mind-blowing as others. It was good, but I order agedashi a lot when I eat at sushi joints, and this wasn't the best I've had. That said, I'm not putting it down. It was good.

My favorite of the night was the kobe beef filet with wasabi. You gotta savor the small bites because there aren't many on the skewer and they are tiny. But as mentioned above, compared to the prices on the strip and the mostly sub-par food I'd had elsewhere, this was excellent. Here my run-down of dishes we tried:
-Miso soup (really good)
-Agedashi tofu (good)
-Kobe beef filet with wasabi (excellent)
-Grilled duck (decent)
-Scallop with soy sauce (good)
-Takana Inari (good according to my daughter who loves inari)
-Carpaccio hamachi (very good)
-Kobe beef skirt with garlic (OK--not much flavor)

Tiny portions, tiny restaurant. Great service. Better food than I'd had anywhere on the strip (minus Gordon Ramsay's Steak). Well worth a visit when you're in Vegas. All of the above plus a Sprite for my daughter was $74.70. Sure as heck beats $60 for a lousy club sandwich from Wolfgang Puck!

What you shouldn't fail to order is the cold and creamy RAKU TOFU. We even ordered seconds of this.. (Along with some of the others mentioned in my notable favorites.) Those of you who don't like tofu: my husband isn't a fan of tofu either and he LOVED this.

I liked Raku so much I went back the next day.

The dining space is very small so make reservations!

My only gripe is that both days, the foie gras chawanmushi (egg custard) wasn't available! *tear*",BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg,5,4,5,pZAEHzX4p8LQClIyRvG7Sw

They finished it off with a raspberry cheesecase for dessert.  It was an overall great meal and experience.  Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing.

5965876,2013-04-03,0,sqRX-XLlhx4rs2c1TpBf8A,"I had to book this place a week in advance and I still didnt get my time slot of choice on Saturday. We had to move reservations to Friday evening because they were so packed. I went with 3 other friends and they were all a little hesitant on trying something new off the strip.  After the first dish though .... half of us couldnt stop raving. By the 3rd dish, all of us couldnt wait to see what other surprises the chef had for our taste buds. 

I can't remember exactly everything we ordered, but I will make a few recommendations of my favorites:   

1. Hammachi Kama $33 - I have had this dish elsewhere but this is the first time I appreciated the texture of the fish. It was so moist and so tender. The fish wasn't overly flavored at all like some places. But the homemade sauce was just popping with zesty flavors. When we were done with this dish, I think all of us were still licking the plate and our chopsticks :) We wanted to order a second but the waitress apologized as they only make one Hammachi Kama a day. 

2.  Striped Jack $24 - We oredered this dish off their daily special without much knowledge of the fish. Ive had the Amber Jack before and appreciate its delicacy. And since the Amber Jack, sashimi never tasted the same again. It has to be the best and the freshest. So I have to say, upon tasting this Striped Jack, I was not disappointed. The dish was beautifully presented with 6 slices of sahimi laid over some crispy glass noodles. The garnishes, included ginger, radish, chopped up striped jack with miso flavor, and chrysanthemum. We asked the waitress what the chrysanthemum was for and she said its typically  used to clear the palette. The entire dish and presentation was so meticulously thought out. I will have to upload photos of this dish later.

3. Enoki wrapped bacon $3 - We ordered two orders of this because its 2 servings a dish. I loved it. The idea of somethign so healthy like an enoki wrapped by a crispy piece of bacon was brilliant. Right as you bite into it, the flavors of the bacon gushes right into your mouth. Must try this one. 

4. Fresh Tofu (Large) $9 - There was no way you come here without trying their home made tofu. This was actually the very first dish that came out. It was recommended that we eat the tofu with their home made green tea flavored salt. What can I say ... The most expensive tofu and most delicious piece of tofu I've had in my life. Okay - I take that back. Tofuya Ukai next to the Tokyo Tower in Tokyo made tofu so soft it could have just slid down my throat. But hey, this is pretty good tofu out side of Japan. MUST TRY !! 

5. Scallop dish - The scallop here was a must try too. The Scallop was huge. We evenly split it amongst the 4 of it. The chef did such a great job infusing the plump scallop with some sort of soy type flavor. I can't explain it. But we wanted to drench our rice with the scallop sauce for sure. lol.



Okay...since this review is getting kinda long and its been 45 mins since i started this review...I'm gonna have to wrap it up and give an overall rating. LOL.... also ... the salmon teriyaki was superb too.  

Overall Service: Its gotta be 2 thumbs up. Highly attentive and friendly for a busy weekend night. We never got neglected. Our waitress checked up on us, water refills, everything. I think we left at least 25% tip for her. 

Overall Food: Highly recommended. I'm from Cali and I've tried them all around so-cal. But I have to say this is closest to the quality I've had in Japan. I appreciate that its authentic and they strive to keep everything home made ... from their sauces, spices, to their tofu. Its all legit.  If you're coming to Vegas, skip the food on the strip becaose you know its catered to a bunch of tourists. And if you're about to dump $60 on a Bellagio buffet or what not, why not put that towards some quality food. When it comes to what goes into your tummy, its always about Quality, and not Quantity.

We did the Omakase premium menu, so I'm not going to bother reviewing every item since it changes, but everything we had was so fresh, perfectly prepared, and delicious. The sashimi was so fresh and flavorful that even my boyfriend, who literally eats microwave chicken and broccoli for dinner most days, could tell the difference between it and what we get at any other Japanese restaurant. 

Service was great, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I'm sure everything came out of the kitchen as soon as it was prepared, but the pacing was kind of odd - the first few courses came out with lots of time to spare in between, then all of a sudden all the meat dishes came out at once.

Seemingly ordered half the menu, and didn't find a dud.  Do yourself a favor and spring for a few of the daily specials that will be brought to your attention via roaming chalkboard.


Sprang for the following:

Agedashi Tofu (first time trying it, and loved every nuance) 

Steamed Foie Gras Egg Custard (delicious)

Deep Fried Chicken (one of the 2 best versions I've had)

Kobe Beef w/ Wasabi (meltingly tender, but tiny)

Kurobuta Pork Cheek (intensely porky)

Butter Sautéed Scallop (highlight of the non-special offerings)

Foie Gras Don (just ok)


Then ordered 2 of the specials:

Flying Fish (prepared 2 ways).  First came out a plate of sashimi cut raw with grated ginger and wasabi. Fish had a relatively mild flavor, but when paired with the house soy sauce (side note: holy shit it's amazing), it sings.  Second was the other filet, sliced and tempura fried, along with the entire skeleton/head in a beautiful broth.  The broth may have been the best thing I tasted all night.

Wagyu ""Hamburger"".  This was a patty of the wagyu beef in the bottom of a clay pot cooked with various sliced vegetables and mushrooms in a thick, sweet sauce.  Unctuous and rich beyond belief.


All of this was paired with multiple Japanese beers and some excellent sake served by a flawless staff.


All told, a truly memorable meal, and one of the 15-20 or so best I've ever had.
