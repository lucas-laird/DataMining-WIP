406004,2015-05-10,0,r1e5Ot6_jGFyV2N_dn8JDQ,I'm salvadorian and my grandma use to make the best pupusas and as she got older she stopped making them and sold her restaurant  and over the years I could not find other restaurants that would make them as good and I would go to every restaurant in search for affordable and delicious real taste of pupusas and was always unsatisfied until now this bakery makes the authentic pupusas and really captures the real taste . I hope you all enjoy this bakery as much as I do it's inexpensive and will leave you speechless.,T9BIQIyNOfQru6fRH7ioqw,3,2,5,VSii002NchIubddLlj9WEw

This bakery knows how to make them perfect. Taste like Fogo de cho tres leches in Beverly Hills. Cinco estrellas For this place. Very friendly staff.

But they are indeed open for business, whether you're in the mood for classic Mexican baked goods, pizza, tacos, custom-made cakes, or burritos. Yeah, the menu is all over the place and I have no idea why.

Played it safe with a carne asada torta ($6) and was wowed by the massive size- it filled the entire takeout box! Unfortunately, the bread was soggy with beans so it was falling apart. I was also disappointed that it did not have any avocado. The carne asada was nicely seasoned with good flavor, but oddly chewy and stringy.

Came back for a different dish with a different meat, sticking to sopes ($2/ea) and chicken- bland all the way around, from the gummy fried masa shell to the dry and unseasoned chicken. Maybe their baked goods and pizzas fare better, but I don't intend to find out. Note that the staff only speaks spanish, but happily this is NOT a cash-only business as I originally assumed.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,10,2,1q8aB1MncVsBjfYApLBEUw

3599692,2010-08-18,3,r1e5Ot6_jGFyV2N_dn8JDQ,"My wife Sylvia Q. stumbled upon this place when we first came to the desert back in 2004 when we hardly knew our way around town and discovered one of the best Tortas de Carne Asada being served in this little hole-in-the-wall bakery.....BAKERY!?!?!?!

Yup this bakery is also a taqueria, pupuseria, and pizza joint all in one!

You can get Mexican and Salvadoran style breads and pastries here, as well as pupusas, pizza, tamales, burritos, tortas, tostadas, sopes, quesadillas, pizza, wings, and the list goes on and on....


Fast forward 6 years later, and we happened to be around that side of town, so we go and see if that little bakery is still up and running.

Sure enough, they're still in business, so we go in and grab a table and order a couple of Carne Asada tortas. We see that they have Menudo(Tripe) as a special of the day, so we get an order as well.

when our order arrives, it is just like it was 6 years ago, Toasted bread made in house everyday served with a very generous piece of carne asada(not chopped up into little pieces like other taquerias) beans , lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos.

You gotta grab this thing with both hands to get a bite, its the biggest torta in town! Our 
Menudo is equally tasty, not gamey, and seasoned well, and comes with HANDMADE tortillas-YUM!

we also got some pan dulce and a chocoflan to go but they weren't all that. Marianna's is much better.
Haven't tried any other savory stuff, but the Torta de Carne Asada is worth coming back for...ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,5,4,3,-c9CJ61oF4JsFR2bcrDmdg
4011793,2012-02-05,1,r1e5Ot6_jGFyV2N_dn8JDQ,"Found this place when I was anxiously looking for some Pan Dulce to take to my son's school.  It was a nice surprise.

Very nostalgic for me to walk into a Mexican bakery, the sights, the smells...always reminds me of my summers in Mexico when my cousins and I would walk to the bakery to buy some Pan Dulce-it was always fun to find the ""best"" pastry. 

Panaderia Tricolor is a tiny place in a strip mall and they offer Salvadorian baked goods and Pupusas  as well.  I was pleased with the variety of pastries and bought two boxes (25 pastries total) for about $10!  Beat that Starbucks!  I am anxious to come back and try out more menu items especially since I've been to San Salvador and had some awesome tasting pupusas there. Service was wonderful-she was so patient as I picked out all the pastries.  

It's a tiny little cozy bakery with only two tables to sit at if you want to order anything off the menu. Variety of pastries was incredible. From conchas  (pink, chocolate, vanilla- egg bread-wonderful to dunk in coffee-my personal favorite) to cochinitos (gingerbread pig shaped cookies) and empanadas and galletas (cookies) all fabulous. Authentic! Try it out!",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,8,5,4,t9AdVPAbvdRnYZDCe2er3Q

Finding a place that comes close to my birth place is no easy task, this place has all my favorite pan dulce styles. I just picked some up before the closing of the place,and let me tell you the bread was just a sweet and melt in your mouth awesome. It's worth the 20 min drive from my home it truly made me think of my summers in Mexico when we would grab some treats after dinner! Definitely my new fav place.

A small shop tucked away on North Decatur in an area still not qualified as North Las Vegas, but not too far away, Panaderia Tricolor is a place many have probably driven by a hundred times without even noticing, a family-owned business operating in the same space for so long that the Las Vegas sun has almost completely faded its signage.

Listed as El Tricolor Bakery above the door, but as Panaderia Tricolor by a street-side sign and in its limited representation on Social Media and Search Engines, visitors to Tricolor will find the space located towards the back-center of a shopping plaza filled with everything from Check Cashing to Nail Salons and Convenience Stores, a step through the door placing patrons in a small standing space surrounded by baking racks, cold cases and two small tables.

Selling both savories and sweets, though the obvious focus is on freshly baked Breads and Pastries in a variety of perhaps four-to-five dozen total, it was with limited English and a lot of pointing that several items were described by a young woman working the front of the house as an older woman labored over dough that appeared to be the base of several dozen Concha, the eventual order comprised of five Pastries and two slices of Cake that were carefully boxed and taken home for consumption.

Trying to best cover a wide range of styles, the total price of $9.75 making a little bit of waste acceptable in an attempt to weigh the quality against other Panaderia in town, first tastes of Tricolors goods came by way of the Pastel de Pina and Caramelized Puff Pastry Stick, both quite mild in terms of sweetness with the Pineapple Cake soft and spongy while the nearly weightless rod was crisp and shattering, but probably been better suited for a Sauce or Coffee for dipping.

Turning attention next to two savory selections, the Salvadoran Quesadilla a 3/4""-thick frisbee-size disc described as ""sort of like cake, but moist and a little sweet"" proving to be just that plus a long-linger of Sesame, the 'cornbread' at Tricolor is nothing like what most American's would think when picturing the hot skillets or piping-hot Muffins down South, this version actually a hefty wedge of just-set Custard atop a more granular base, the flavor a bit like cream corn but with a more egginess and Butter.

Underwhelmed by a Turnover with good lamination but cloying sweetness thanks to HFCS-based Cherry Pie filling, and even more put-off by a tennis-ball size Guava Besos with good Jam but Dough so chalky and flavorless that it may as well have been a few days stale, it was finally with the ""4x Cake"" that a taste of Panaderia Tricolor came to an end, the Chocolate Cake and Cheesecake relatively par for the course while smooth Flan and sopping-wet Tres Leches were both about as good as they come in Las Vegas, another visit to try each on their own probably necessary at some point in the near future.

**1/2:Discovered as part of what has become a fun attempt to find the best Tres Leches Cake in Sin City, that title still belonging to Drago Sister's on South Rainbow, Panaderia Tricolor has a lot to offer at a good price with excellent customer service, though the quality of several items previously enjoyed elsewhere was unfortunately a little inconsistent.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,3,DXEdSpJdWpYvcJOYBsliXw

Everyone was so friendly and I look forward to starting my day with a fresh, not-too-sweet bread and seeing the neighborhood wake up.
I look forward to trying their papusas and pizza.  That was a surprise. 
I am French Italian American but love family owned places.
I will be back many times.
Their bolillos are the best, biggest and freshest I have ever eaten in my life.  Their Palmiers- are delightful. Etc etc..
