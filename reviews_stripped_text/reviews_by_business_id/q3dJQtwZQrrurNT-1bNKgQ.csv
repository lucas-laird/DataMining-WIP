We had the house and Caesar salads and both were good but nothing really special. 
My wife had the chicken parm which she enjoyed. 
My pasta was decent enough and you can tell they make it on the spot which is nice. I was disappointed with the sauce though. For all the hype I heard from the servers about it I found it to be rather boring. Too bad. They also didn't have any pasta salad available for a side dish which I found odd at a pasta place. On a positive note the meatballs themselves were delicious.
It's certainly not a bad place and we may try for dinner one night and hope for a little better.",AdxhlxXSGjRsCQxG6ZjfTw,0,0,3,60uWokdStGWUMxflM0PuOg

Went with my son for a special evening out, very bad decision.

Ceasar salads were drab, over garlicky. They must have been prepared for a while - very limp and lifeless. I had about 3 bites of mine.  The veal parmesan was completely over cooked, over-breaded, drowning in sauce and cheese -terrible. Raviolis were chewy, salty in a watery red sauce.

Plus side - cheesy garlic bread was good.

Maybe it's because I travel, dine frequently in SF, Chicago, NYC - very much enjoy good. Definitely not here, will not come back or recommend.

Service was amazing. Our glasses of water and wine never went below 1/2 full. We ordered the bruschetta (above average) as an appetizer. The house bread basket with garlic butter was yummy too. For entrees, he had the shrimp scampi and I had the Chicken Angelo. Both were amazing! I had the house italian salad and he had the caesar...very good as well. 

For dessert we got the Italian coffee with amaretto...HIGHLIGHT of the meal by far! My pinot noir was fantastic too.

Overall, the experience was phenomenal and I would recommend the restaurant to anyone any day. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the heat. We were sitting by an AC monitor that read the current temperature at 86 degrees. It was a little uncomfortable even for small people who love being in the warm outdoors!

First upon arrival we were greeted in the interesting way at the speak-easy door by the maitre d.  We did not have a reservation and we were sat within 5 minute upon arrival.   While waiting I will add the maitre d was discussing how they were waiting for Anthony Bourdin to arrive...
We were sat and waited a good 10 minutes before being asked if we would like to order anything to drink.  when we finally ordered we were ready to finalize our entire meal order.  I ordered the calamari and linquini and clams.  my husband ordered the sausage ravioli .  
We were brought bread which I seriously thought looked and tasted like a crouton.  crunchy and dry.
when the wines were served I was unhappily surprised and how small the glass of red was.  for 12 dollars you would think the glass would be served 1/2 full however it was filled 1/4 full and the white was 3/4 full.
the calamari came and it tasted frozen and heated through.  
we finished the calamari and waited at least 25 min until our entrees came.  i knew after my first bite of the linquini and clams the ""fresh pasta"" wasnt fresh, the clams were very very chewy and the sauce tasted like it had tons of sugar in it.  i have never tasted linquine and clams white sauce quite like this before.  my husbands ravolis tasted ok but again the sauce didnt taste fresh more like Hunts Spaghetti Sauce out of the can.
i was looking forward to the bread pudding but after eating the entree i decided that if the appetizer and main were so bad i didnt think capos could recover with a good dessert so we decided to pass.
we live quite close to capos and and we decided to leave immediately following dinner.  my stomach was turning and I just wanted to get home.  not 2 minutes upon leaving did I tell my husband that i felt sick.  we were 1 block away from home and i made him pull over.  i could not hold it in , i tried but couldnt .  so with the overcooked possibly spoiled clams, not fresh made pasta, chewy calamari and old bread i had left on the pavement i am here at YELP making sure you all know how horrible my experience was.

They let my husband and I in with no fanfare or show. Not sure what the ""admittance"" process is suppose to be, but it did not live up to the hype of the previous reviews. Once we were seated (in the back by the kitchen), we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat and to contemplate the meaning of life.  It seemed that we and the 3 other surrounding tables were be handled by 2 different servers but they did not seem to communicate with each other.  Service was spotty at best. The male server was amazing at saying he would bring the items we were missing but then forget. He was like the guy on 50 First Dates whose memory would reset after 10 seconds.  Then after waiting for the female server to come back we would get our items promptly. 

Food:  The cheap knock off version of what people think Italian good should taste like.  I ordered Santucci's Pasta with a huge meatball and my husband ordered Da Don's Lasagna.  My paste seemed slightly undercooked and the sauce and meatball had a strange flavor. It was nothing special.  My husbands lasagna was ok but they use the same sauce as my spaghetti.  That would have been fine if the sauce had been good, but it definitely was not. 

Entertainment:  There's not a whole lot that I can say about it since we could not see it from where we were seated. I will say that while we couldn't see it, we could definitely hear it.  The male singers voice was blaring over the speakers. It was so loud that my husband and I could not talk without yelling at each other.  This probably would not have been an issue had we been able to see what was going on.  This ended up annoying us more than anything. We were happy when he finally decided to take a break.  They went to canned CD music which was perfect because it wasn't as loud.

Price:  The best way I can describe this is they charge Friday night A team stripper price for the Tuesday afternoon C team.

Another in the party ordered the steak, which was cooked properly but for the cost of this is was a pretty small order and the potatoes were terrible.  The Shrimp in the shrimp scampi was terrible and the pasta spicy.  Ok for us but, for most I think would be way too spicy.  We also got the fettuccine alfredo which was not that good.  We have been here 3 times before and mostly go back for the entertainment but, I think this will be our last time.  The food was not good. They also add the gratuity of 19% to the bill when it came.  Then their Credit Card machine wasn't working so, we had to pay cash.  What's up with that??   I definitely felt ripped off and this was for my parents birthdays.  I don't want to be embarrassed again.   There are hundreds of restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from and this is not on my list any longer.",OxtecaIOkUuon-bdUVqD4g,0,0,1,Ig7f4lHb_kT0lsnMXHZa_A

Reminiscent of a Sicilian mafia hideout, we literally stood outside the blackened windows, after ringing the doorbell, to be verified before being allowed to enter.  It's dark mood belies a jovial waitstaff and really good food.  We ordered chicken and veal parmigiana, shrimp scampi, and pasta primavera.  All were good, hearty portions and tasteful. 
If you are looking for a restaurant with beautifully presented meals, don't go to Capo's.  But if you're looking for good food, a little schtick (think Carnegie Deli), and a respite from the flash and glitz of Las Vegas, then try Capo's Italian Cuisine.

And specifically, the service at the Tropicana location (not to say the service at the Sahara location is poor or anything--have been there too, and definitely enjoyed it.  Jeanine is the gal who makes the difference at the Tropicana location...she is one of the most personable, courteous, on-the-ball servers I have ever met!  

I have dined here many times, whether just with a local friend or two, a larger dinner party, or out-of-town guests.  Anyone I have introduced to the restaurant has absolutely loved it!  The dimly lit atmosphere is very relaxing, and the Italian mobster/mafia-themed decor is unique and different.  

The food is delicious and the portion-sizes are generous.  I completely agree with anyone else's recommendation of the bruschetta...once you start eating it, you won't want to stop.  Just be sure you have a few breath mints with you if you are planning to go out afterwards, as the garlic in the bruschetta will definitely stick with you for a few hours. ;)

Is this the finest Italian restaurant out there? No.  But compared to other Italian restaurants in the same class (i.e. smaller, local, semi-casual, mid-priced), it is definitely among the best!",_mBwI-3qiuibrX44R-Wz7w,4,2,5,su3hdAMfaiJNIvG9bNYwtg

201287,2011-09-01,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"My wife and I were in Las Vegas for our 20th wedding anniversary and since we are both into ""Godfather-like"" things (movies, restaurants, etc) we wanted to check out Capo's ourselves.  We had first seen the Capo's restaurant when driving around Las Vegas on a previous trip - so we had it 'marked' (if you will) for our next visit.

Nothing short of amazing is what I would say.  The service was fantastic - we mentioned in casual conversation with our waiter that it was our 20th anniversary and before we knew it, we were being acknowledged by the bar singer.  He dedicated a song to my wife and I and it *just happened* to be her absolute favorite song -  Unforgettable by Nat King Cole.  Coincidence?  Maybe - but it really set the mood for the rest of the evening.

Either the owner or the chef came around to our tables during the evening to see how we liked our 'experience.'  He carried on a 5 minute conversation with us which was fantastic.  He did not seem hurried or the usual 'How was your dinner' and then on to the next table.  It was yet another very nice touch.

When we arrived, the place had about four or five other patrons in it.  We got there about 6:00PM on a Wednesday.  By the time we left (about 8:00 or so), the restaurant was about half-full.

Overall, the food was simply fantastic.  We've had lots of Italian food - including Italian food from places in Chicago, and both my wife and I agreed that this was the best we had had.  I highly suggest you try out Capo's if you're in the neighborhood.  It's worth the 10 minute drive from the strip.",xuRs_3KlmRzwH7qHTi-o_A,0,0,5,V_6jX3QshnkOEbzaet-qUg

Boy, were we wrong.
 
First off, the restaurant was DARK. I remember it being dimly lit the last time we had dinner there, but not like that.  I couldn't even see the faces of the people surrounding me, much less my food.  Im not one to complain too much about the ambiance, but I know something is wrong when I walk out of there with tired, strained eyes.  Plus, I think there was an alterior motive for this dark lighting, aside from an energy savings technique (more on this later).  
  
The service was crappy, or should i say our waitress was. She didn't know most of the plates offered on the menu, and she was spastic and disconnected.  We all asked for water with no ice, but they gave us the opposite. And we asked for a couple of extra things, like olive oil for bread, but they never made it to our table. 

The food was... so-so. Some dishes were overly spiced.  Parents shrimp scampi had 6 shrimps each, tops.  Lasagna was okay.  Overall it was decent, but the first time we went there, the food was way better.  Or maybe it seemed that way because we had a better experience.  Or maybe seeing your food is part of the experience of enjoying it, and if you can't see it, you can't enjoy it.  

Lastly, but most importantly, we are certain that they *OVERCHARGED* us. The bill came close to 300 (not including the tip we gave), and altho we thought it was too much, we didn't fight it because we were with my parents (don't wanna look bad) and we couldn't even read the bill. (again, the lighting issue... maybe that's why they keep it so dark in there.)  After tallying up the score at home, we realize that they most likely charged us an 18 to 20 percent gratuity (for a group of 6? Really?) and didn't tell us. (Lucky them, they got two tips).  But that still doesn't account for the total amount that they charged us, so we think that they probably charged us an extra plate as well.  We will never know, because we never saw the receipt properly at the restaurant (try reading a note hand written in pencil in the darkest corner you can manage, and that was our situation) and they didn't give us a receipt to take home.
 
So in short, poor lighting, bad service, and ridiculous pricing/charging methods will keep us away.  The food definitely isn't worth it.",FzBt6pSciU5RYPKPssoNig,3,0,2,ikeJ_54zxS-Ffj4l3fV81w

First time in my life I literally cleaned up plates in Italian restaurant :) because a) I was really hungry; b) portions were just right to allow for dessert in the end.

We started (as recommended) with Stuffed Mushrooms - they were great and even though my g/f doesn't like olives in any form she ate a half of the portion :)
I had lasagna - it was great and portion was not huge which is a plus because I wanted to leave room for dessert. I also had bean and pasta soup with it - excellent.
My g/f ordered fetuchini alfredo with shrimp - she didn't manage to finish the pasta but she got all the shrimp out of it for sure - it was big and (what's that fancy word ..) - succulent. She also liked Italian egg drop soup.

Then we had chocolate cake with side of ice cream - plate was clean :)
And finally when we were ready to go the singer came to our table and sung a serenade for my girlfriend. 

Bottom line:
+ interior is cool
+ food's good
+ singer is great

The idea for Capo's is that you are in a speakeasy from the 1930's.  Back entryways, secret doors, dim lighting... it all makes for a fun and interesting atmosphere.  Our friends were especially impressed since we surprised them with our restaurant selection.

When you get into the restaurant, be prepared for the dim lighting- they really aren't kidding here.  It was still daylight outside when we got to the restaurant and it took my eyes several minutes to adjust.  But they keep the idea fun and even give you little flashlights on your menu to help you read it if necessary.

The seating is posh and comfortable and I love the chandeliers above every table.  The tables are large enough for a party of four (like ours) to have a good time, but still intimate enough for all you Romeos out there.  At 6 o'clock they have a singer that performs old Sinatra songs and the like.  He was a great guy that not only sang well, but also chats up the diners and later dedicates songs to them.  My girlfriend and I had ""Unforgettable"" dedicated to us.  Needless to say, I felt pretty special.

As for the meal, they start you off with bread and garlic butter.  The butter was tasty, but like other reviewers said the bread hardens up pretty quickly.  Not really sure how this is possible, but it's true.  It's not inedible but just not as yummy as when they first bring it out.

The salads were great and vinaigrette dressing was delicious.  The veggies were fresh and I loved the little artichoke heart they throw in for good measure (but I'm a sucker for artichokes).

I ordered the Vodka Penne and it was so good I'm still thinking about it.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a lot of flavor.  I was very happy with my entree.

Two others in my party ordered the pasta with alfredo and another ordered the stuffed chicken.  Everyone else said their entrees were good, but I don't think they liked them as well as I liked mine.

Our waitress was fantastic- super friendly and checked up on us just enough.  She was also more than happy to bring out a special cake that our friends had made for us and even lit a candle on it.  The other employees we met were really friendly as well.

The few cons:
-bread could be better and perhaps a couple of entrees as well
-for how nice the dining area is, the bathroom made me a little sad
-I didn't like walking through a smokers lounge to get back outside
-it was too warm in the restaurant- not sure if the air was broken or they were going for the speakeasy atmosphere, but the temperature needed to be turned down about 5 degrees (and I'm always cold, so you know it has to be warm for me to say something)
-the food is a little overpriced

I'm going with five stars since this was overall a very memorable experience for me.  Between the employees, the singer, the food, and the atmosphere I definitely have plans to come back.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,8,3,5,dJesGPN5Z4qktZXVry-AXQ

My 72 year old aunt from Boston and her brother and sister who not to mention are iTALIAN and know there food, figured this would be the best place to dine in.   
Of course the whole ""gangster mob"" theme is entertaining but the lighting is way too dark! Especially since we had three people over the age of 60 and eyesight is not great to begin with.
When we got inside and got to the table to order drinks the table broke. understandable that accidents happen but we didn't get our drinks until the table was fixed which was 15 min later and not to mention the table was never fixed but we were moved.  They moved us into a whole  different side of the restaurant which was secluded from the dining area  which in some cases would be nice if your on a date but not in this situation.  My grandparents were so short they could barley see over the table top. We got our Cesar salads and it was so drenched with salad dressing and soggy it was unbearable to eat. We Ordered another salad with dressing on the Side and that couldn't even be done right.  So we all ordered the veil parm and to start off  it tasted more like a flattened piece of chicken. Did not get a choice of pasta it was strictly spaghetti and extra cost if you wanted a different style. They pretty much had it pre made and under a heat lamp waiting to be served. The spaghetti was literally only 4oz.  I asked to return the dish and the waitress said no it can't be done and instead brought me a dessert.  I had told her I did not eat dessert and she had said to me sorry that's all you can get.  All I wanted was my $30 refunded off my bill.  Needles to say we had spent $60 on a groupon and our bill came out to $200 so it's not like we were getting our meal for free. So I don't think that anyone should be treated different for having a coupon.   It was sad to see such horrible service at a place with such potential, maybe it was because they were just too busy and overwhelmed.

376989,2013-04-12,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!  

DO NOT GO! -  First had to flag someone down for drink order and then later someone else to get our waitress to FINALLY take our food order. The busser (who was too new to be on his own) actually went twice to the bar to get my parents a new beverage because our waitress was lost again. 

Two out of four food dishes were INCORRECT. When we attempted to let her know the mistakes she argued with us, saying the items didnt come with what we thought they did. Since I STILL HAD A MENU I pointed out that we were right. So, she says to my mom she must have grabbed the wrong plate but tells my bf  ""oh we don't serve mashed potatoes with the $40 steak anymore cause no one likes them"". Ummm something she failed to mention when he placed the order and, also, NOT what the menu said, to which I proved, again, SINCE I HAD A MENU STILL.  She leaves with my mothers dish to replace the incorrect pasta with the roasted potatoes and brings back the same plate with the pasta still on it, and half a spoonful of what the side should have originally been!!???  

Let me also not forget to mention the stacked dishes on the edge of the crumb filled table that neither her or the busser ever picked up yet we stacked to make room for our dinner. Let me also point out that my mother, father and I SHARED two butter knifes for our meals. 

Our waitress FINALLY checked on us after we had been sitting with nothing in front of us for quite some time (everything stacked on the edge of the table) and asked if we wanted dessert, which we declined. Not sure why it took her sooooo long to drop the bill, but when I finally started keeping track, two full songs by the piano player had cycled thru....again, that was AFTER I started keeping track. 

When we left I almost took a picture of the table with stacked dishes, a MENU a couple empty bread plates and butter container (when we didn't even have bread since BEFORE we placed our food order.)

So, I called today to speak with the manager....... I immediately let her know I was unhappy and calling to let her know about our experience to let them rectify it instead of blasting it all over fb or yelp, which she was thankful for, then asked me to hold a moment.   Toni, (the GM) put the phone down and had a conversation with someone else on another phone...that I could hear every word of!!!!!! ""Whatcha doing? ......Oh yeah, I accidentally put myself on the schedule and working so now I'm short staffed........ Yeah, I'm hoping so and so calls me back too...... yeah, I can't believe i did either. Blah blah blah"" for almost four full minutes!!! Are you fng kidding me? 

So when she gets back on the phone she goes so what happened? And I told her to hold on cause I'm really annoyed she just held that whole conversation with an upset customer on the phone waiting who could hear every word. Her response? ""She called first""... And I said that's awesome, but you should have let her go as soon as you found out she wasn't available instead of carrying on a conversation that I could hear!!!!! That's when she told me not to tell her how to run her business.  I hung up ...  Not going to have much of a business if she treats customers like that.

So, basically  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!  The food is great (if you get the correct order) BUT THE SERVICE FROM BUSSER TO UPPER MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE!!!!!",0VetsURczO5yXAtTU2Kl-w,2,0,1,tHNXYyHYqF5yk2YiclCNYw

I have been put in the unfortunate position of having to choose the restaurant for my firiends who may only be here for one night passing through.  Luckily for me Capo's is here!  I ALWAYS talk over with them if they want to eat a 'famous chef' dinner or an interesting fun and always delicious dinner, my favorite italian place.  
    
  When friends want the ""famous chef"" dinner the conversation continues and we choose from many and .... it doesn't always turn out so well, as all of us locals know.   But I always promise to myself the next time will be Capo's!    

THEN - those who chose Capo's the first time ALWAYS rave rave rave about the experience and the food - ALWAYS!   And I always ask if they think they've made the right decision and they all tell me I should not have given them a choice.  

I have yet to have that happen once with  the ""famous chef"" restaurant experience.  

Wait, except for once, mom and dad visited and we had a Wolfgang Puck  Thanksgiving Day meal... mom loved it, but I get the feeling she likes to say Wolfgang Puck too.  Also no 'rave rave rave', just a nod saying this is better than I expected.  ;-)

436644,2012-07-11,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"My wife and I went there for our anniversary because we had heard it was a unique mob-themed Italian restaurant. When you first walk in, you're in a small room where you need to ring a buzzer to get in. A host opens a opens a small hatch to see who you are, then opens a hidden door behind the pay phone to let you in. We thought this was pretty neat because it gave it a real speakeasy feel to it. 

You walk through the hidden door and you'r in the restaurant. The lights are kept very dim, which adds to the mystic of the place. After allowing our eyes to adjust, you'll see old mob photos on the wall and the chefs cooking in the open kitchen next to the bar. 

The level of cheese elevated to a whole new level when we saw the music was coming from a gentleman singing from his karaoke set up. I can't make this up. He appeared to be a regular ""attraction"" because all the staff knew him. At one point his CD started skipping while he was singing ""Quando, Quando, Quando"". I told my wife he must be singing the remix version! He started the song over. I can only assume because he didn't want his artistic integrity compromised. This amused me on so many levels... who hires a karaoke singer as their entertainment? And more importantly... who uses CD's anymore???

Once we were seated at our table, the staff seemed very responsive and courteous. They did a good job of keeping our glasses full of water and clearing plates as we emptied them. The quality of food left a lot to be desired. The marinara sauce on my wife's pasta was cold, the picatta sauce was just so-so. The real laugher came with the side of risotto. Rather than taking the time needed to properly make it using arborio rice and slow cooking it, they steamed long-grain white rice, added some cheese and mushrooms, and called it ""risotto"". 

If you're looking for good Italian food, I'd rate this place somewhere below Sbarro's. If you're looking for a novelty restaurant with a so-so mob theme, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, save yourself the drive.",_mu6fobW-GrhavXLumN7ag,0,0,1,IxzLFHrVVZI94ZM2IfA69Q

This is an old-school Italian-American red sauce joint. I grew up with this kind of food in New Jersey and my Scottish husband has really taken a liking to it. 

Been here for both lunch and dinner. 

Lunch offers a more limited menu including some specials. The chicken parm (sandwich or entree) is one of the best I've ever had. The sandwich has perfectly breaded chicken, with good gooey cheese on quality bread, and the entree portion of the chicken parm is enormous and so delicious. I don't even like spaghetti and meatballs usually but the spaghetti here with one giant, perfect meatball in amazing red sauce is my exception for that. 

If you can save room for dessert, have the cheesecake or cannoli. 

Nice wines and cocktails, service is really friendly and good overall. 

Interior is awesome with booths scattered throughout, dark and great ambiance (as long as you ignore that half the pictures on the walls are of gangsters and other violent mass killers).

Italians who are actually from Italy probably wouldn't consider this ""real"" Italian food. But it's Italian-American comfort food at its best, and they do it really, really well.",cWzxqo5K69bI-xfWU1oEvA,2,1,4,QVhWdrYJmJOtE3SsQ-7xuA

It is quite dark inside, but they provide small lights for reading the menu.

I mentioned to the manager that we were celebrating a 30th wedding anniversary. I thought maybe he would have his wait staff bring them out a piece of cake with a candle or something in recognition as other restaurants often do. He did nothing at all.

 1st the hostess.. he was rude.. we had a reservation for 4 people.. when you come in you have to knock on the door.. while my husband boss was still talking to him (hostess) thru the little window.. he closed it on him. Oookay and when he finally opened the door.. we followed him to the back of the restaurant.. instead of him walking us to the table..  he pointed to where our seats were and he walked back to the front.. 
Now the place was beautiful and the entertainment was greeeaattt.. I think we sat there for a while waiting on a server to pick our table up. We didnt even have a server assigned to us..  anyway we received our drinks super late.. I was served a dirty glass of coke.. I told the busser politely excuse me, my glass is dirty can i have another coke.. he said no problem took the glass to the bar sat it down.. i dont know if he realized it.. but.. he brung me back the same coke i told him to take away.. now i use to be a dishwasher for 4 years so I pay attention to things like this. So i just didnt touch my drink.. we ordered appetizers garlic bread with cheese and calamari.. our party was passing the the food around and when it got to me i was disappointed because where you grip the plate there was dirty food stuck to the bottom of the bowl brim so you can feel it.. our plates werent washed properly.. I was grossed OUT ready to leave.. we couldnt find our server.. she disappeared some where so we were just sitting there..  my asparagus soup was old.. it had a film on top from sitting so long and the middle was cold . You could tell our food sat in the window for a long time. My shrimp was stale (dried out) We ended up being the last party on the floor.. they were closing we had to ask a busser for our check because no one knew where our server was.

The first time I went here was 8/30/15 with a small group and I had so much fun! The Frank Sinatra singer was fun, the magician that came around to each table was entertaining and the eggplant parmesan was the best I had tried in Vegas.

WHAT WENT WRONG: Visit on 12/10/15

My parents were visiting from MI and I couldn't wait to take them to Capo's as part of an early Christmas gift. This would be my second time there. We made reservations on a Thursday night around 7:30 p.m. thinking it wouldn't be too busy. We arrived 10 mins late due to traffic and when we got there they still didn't have our table ready. The inside of the restaurant was uncomfortably hot inside and there are no windows to let in the air. We had to wait 15 mins standing by the bar because there were no seats available at the bar and I felt like I might melt from the temperature. There were a couple tables open and I'm not sure why they weren't offered to us. When they had our seats ready, we had to wait another 15 mins for our waitress Ashley to arrive. It was really strange we were waiting so long when we had reservations. 

We ordered our food and I made it really clear to Ashley that my mom was vegetarian (I even told her she had been a vegetarian for 40 years) and wanted the VEGETARIAN meatball. Our entrees came and my mom started eating her food and said, ""this tastes like beef."" I tried a bite of it and felt sick the rest of the night. We couldn't find our waitress anywhere to alert her of the mistake. My mom said, ""it really seems like we're not getting any attention at our table tonight."" My dad ended up flagging down a busser to tell him about the mistake. The order was sent back to the kitchen and the meatball was corrected and we finally saw our waitress again. We told her about the meatball and I also had to ask for a basket of their complimentary bread because she hadn't brought any out when we were seated. By the time my mom's meatball and the bread basket arrived at the table my dad and I were finished eating and my mom had to eat alone - we didn't get to enjoy Christmas dinner together :/ I've never received a bread basket at the end of my meal before at any other restaurant. My mom also felt sick from eating the beef and we didn't get our waters refilled once. I felt awful.

The only reason I didn't give this place one star is because the guy singing the Frank Sinatra hits was attentive to us and made my mom smile. We left him a big tip. I really wouldn't recommend this place at this point. I work at a local hospital  in Vegas and I see firsthand the damage food poisoning/food allergies can wreck, plus the wait service was REALLY poor.

This place is too far from the heart of Vegas to make it worth venturing out to for the low quality and the price. I don't recommend this place to anyone any more, esp. if you're a vegetarian or have a special diet. For good, quality Italian food/better service, I recommend Ventanos. It is where I will take my parents the next time they are in town. I really regret having a Christmas dinner at Capo's.",pqCQqAOOdIoYoMeCCgxRRA,3,1,2,lHxAgvjJe27RD9Ab88gVEQ

This was a let down considering we could hear the entertainment of live singing and music and everyone enjoying it while we were stuck in a extremely dark boring room watching the dishwasher through an open curtain. Apparently there not big on having kids in the establishment. It took our waitress about 10 min to take our drink order and then an additional 15 to come back to take our food order. We got our soup and salads shortly after which were not impressive at all but we were looking forward to our entrees...... 50 minutes later we were still sitting there in the dark with one other table with kids bored out our minds and starving. We asked our server how much longer it would be and were told ""2 minutes"",  ten minutes had gone by and the table aside of us who got there well after us received there meals first which were steaks and pastas! Obviously we were extremely frustrated at this point and told another server who was trying to pacify us by saying our food was coming out now that we were done with the situation and leaving. We offered to the manager to pay for our sodas and soups/salads and he treated us very rudely as if we were the problem saying our food was coming out in 2 minutes! We explained to him our frustration and he acted as if he could care less, he told the owners brother the situation n they both kept there backs turned to us not giving us an answer to how much we owed, they finally told us not to worry about it.

Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by a classic Italian Mob looking joint complete with the cheesy crooner singing tableside.  The setting and ambiance are perfect.

As for the meal, 

The wine list is a very lacking, as it was mostly new world wines with only fifteen or so selections.  We settled on a bottle of Ruffino Gold Label ($60), all though if they had any quality Italian wines we would have been happy to spend a bit more.  On the high end side of things they only had Silver Oak and Opus One, which were priced far below normal Vegas mark-ups ($110 & $250).

I got there a bit after my friends who had already ordered appetizers.  When the apps came, they brought out the bruschetta with no cheese instead of no pancetta as my friends had claimed to order it.  My friends can be space cadets so this could have been their fault.  Regardless of who's fault it was, the waitress was very nice and brought a new one and allowed us to keep the improperly made one on the table.

I ordered the Pasta Fagioli soup which was excellent, but served luke warm, and then the Veal Piccata which was also very good, all though I thought it was a bit of a small portion.  Everybody else at the table really enjoyed their meals, and it was a pleasant experience with Dean Martin and Frankie Blue Eyes being sung five feet away from us.

Our server was very nice and attentive even though she had quite a few tables running at once.

I will come back to Capos when I am in the mood for a fun evening away from the strip.  The food is good, but not great.  But considering that it's not that expensive, and they have to keep a guy employed just to scare the crap out of you at the front door, I'll give them a pass.  They get five stars because I did enjoy the evening very much, and I don't want to get whacked next time I come in if I only gave it four.",UQm8Cib9mvQpxHE07sAhFA,1,1,5,Crh2LVn-r4C2GykeifGn4g

The mushroom risotto I got with it was bland and watery.  My wife got the chicken parm and left half of it on her plate.  The salads that came with the meal were tiny. 

Guess you are paying for the speakeasy theme because the prices they charge are way too high for what they give you,  plus you are forced to order way overpriced drinks to get the 2-for -1 deal.

I don't even know how relevant it is in the evening, though maybe the entertainment may be better than the food.  I went to lunch there recently with a group of friends.  The food was not very good.  Their bread is horrible!  It is dry and tasteless. Come on guys, with all the restaurants in Las Vegas who serve good bread, you can do better!  Several of us got food which was not very warm.  One person got a burnt (really burnt) meatball.  The tomato sauce was sickeningly sweet, as though it had a ton of sugar in it. I was most disappointed with my dish, Pasta Primavera. You would think it would be a medley of veggies, i.e. brocolli, squash, carrots, etc. 
Nope! It was as if they took the pasta and threw in some of their bell pepper strips (tiny) from their sausage and peppers, and added tons of red onion. That was it and this meager amount of vegetable was swimming in oil.  
The atmosphere was depressing with no windows and big chandeliers and dark walls.  If you are a tourist and want the ""speakeasy"" feeling of the mobs, go to The Plaza hotel downtown and go to Oscar's.  They have a cute backroom with much better atmosphere and much, much better food. In all fairness, the waiter we had was such a nice young man and kept trying to appease our group, and so I say ""don't shoot the messenger"", it wasn't his fault the manager can't get a good Italian chef or find a decent bread bakery.

The lasagna was 2 lasagna noodles with a little bit of meat and runny cheese in the middle swimming in pasta sauce. The eggplant Parmesan was covered in cheese that turned very hard and chewy like string cheese. The pasta noodles was soft and mushy and the red sauce was very bland.

This place is quite an experience... Initially it felt like I was at Disneyland on the haunted house ride.  We opened the door and entered into a small room with wall to wall dark wood.  We stood there for a few minutes and then a small window opened behind us.  I was so surprised and caught off guard, I let out a loud yelp.

The side door opened, which lead us into a dark restaurant.  The place was decorated with old italian mafia type accessories.  Most of the props looked really old and it further reinforced the feeling of being at Disneyland. 

We were seated on the stage area and had a good view of the live singer, who sang Dean Martin hits most of the night and it sounded really good.  

The restaurant was so dark, the menus had small flashlights attached to them.   We had the egg drop soup, appetizer pizza, scallops and arrabiata pasta.  Everything was very good.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

No choices of substitution are allowed; someone in our group with dietary restrictions asked if she could substitute anything else....broccoli, a side salad, cottage cheese, coleslaw.  No substitutions are available.  She was told she could just not get the side if she wanted.  Same price.  The pasta salad was awful, as were the fries.  The fries come with some kind of weird sauce on them.....a mayonnaise based sauce that wrecked the fries.  One person ordered the fries without the sauce.  They were average at best. I feel this restaurant should expand the selection of the two sides that no one in our group of 5 liked at all. The house salad was basically lettuce that was not good.

I had the house salad, and the meatball sandwich. Salad was good, with good dressing. Meatball sandwich was great- good meatballs and sauce. 

I tried the pasta and house gravy (tomato sauce) and while it was good, it wasn't my style. While I enjoy spicy and hot food, I like my pasta sauce sweeter- so it's not that the sauce isn't good, it is just not my style. It was more like an arrabiata, or fra diavolo IMO. 

Our waitress was really great. She was fun and did a good job. Cute too. ;-). 


Atmosphere was neat. Kind of like a speakeasy. Red vinyl booths, dark ambiance with music like Sinatra and the like.

We loved the other location and were hoping that the new location would be just as good or better.   Please note that we are a couple that go out to dinner often, we like all kinds of food and are willing to pay for great service, food and ambiance.

Our journey here began when we went into the private room entrance and we were asked ""how many are in your party.""    For those of you who frequented the ""other"" location, this was a first of many touches that are now gone from the ""new"" location.   We were then asked if we wanted to sit at our table and wait for our friends.  

We opted to have a drink at the bar.   The bar is actually opposite the open kitchen which is very HOT and not comfortable at all.   The bartender, who was a very good one, was talking to us about schedule issues for the staff and how she was supposed to be there in the morning and not the evening......etc, etc.    Not exactly a welcoming opener to our dinner.     

Our friends showed up within a few minutes and we were escorted back to a back booth in the restaurant.    I asked if it was a good table and was told it was ""superb"".   Ah, if they only told us that a large party was going to be sitting in front of us!   The noise was so loud I couldn't hear the people next to me talk.   When the singer began his act, the place was way over the top loud.   In the other location, the singer interacted with the people in the restaurant.   This was not the case here.

The restaurant air-conditioning was almost non-existent and actually become extremely uncomfortable.   No, I wasn't having a hot flash, I was HOT!   Is this a sign of the restaurant not being able to afford their energy bill??

Our waitress was very nonchalant and really not very friendly.    We ordered drinks, and then dinner.   The menu is extensive although no eggplant dishes which was weird for an Italian Restaurant.   The food was just ""okay"".   We have definitely had better and for way less money.    

One of the ladies in our party had a shrimp dish and the shrimp was almost hard as a rock and way overcooked.   When the Chef came around to ask how things were, our friend said that her shrimp dish was way overcooked.   His response, ""thank you for letting us know"", and moved on.   

We had a piece of cheese cake for dessert with caramel sauce and it was worse than store bought cheese cake.     The flavor was simply ""okay"".   Not great.

We did use a Restaurant.com coupon which saved us $30 but the coupon also stipulates that 18% gratuity is added to the check.   I would skip this restaurant and this coupon.

Is a standard spaghetti or angel hair pasta w/ marinara sauce really worth $20? My lasagna was good, but not $18 good. 

All in all, good service, good food, good atmosphere, not so good prices.

Pedí un plato de ""scampi salteados"" lleba mantequilla y pedí que no lo pusieran junto. Una ensalada con lechugas y que le quitasen el quese parmesano. Pedí todo junto con el m plato de mi esposo. El pidió unos espagueti con salchicha. 1 llegó todo fuera de tiempo. El plato principal llegó antes que la ensalada que por supuesto tenía solo lechugas con un cuarto miserable de una alcachofa, a pesar de que decía que venía con alcachofas. Plural. Nada. Los camarones llegaron con la mantequilla y no como pedí. El servicio poco informado de la comanda. Y para colmo malas caras. Una pena que este envoltorio solo sea tan ficticio y falso como el decorado.

They have a lounge singer which is a nice touch and he is not too in your face either. I cannot express how good the food was. I had the tortellini special with added meatball.

They had The Godfather playing on a tv with the subtitles on. The entertainment was on point with a solo crooner performing with a digital band...he was outstanding. They also had a roaming magician working off of tips. I hate to say it but he was incredible lol. Thought he was going to be annoying but I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I would have changed would be the chairs in the banquet room. Way to low and not very comfortable. The food? Off the charts good. I had the Chicken Anastasia and grilled veggies. SO on point. Everyone is se enjoyed their dishes as well to the point that everyone was talking about it the next day. I brought my wife here a couple of nights later and it was just as amazing.

I got a salad and they used way too much dressing.  I had to send back and ask for dressing on the side. The server was so nice and knew exactly when to come over to the table. The ""pink sauce"" (as they call it) was great with the meal and we even dipped the bread in it. Tried the cheesecake dessert and its not exactly what I'm used to but was also good. Reason not a 5 star: the restaurant opens at 5 and the piano player, which I think it a huge part of the atmosphere, didn't start playing until after 6. The food was a little over priced. Once you are seated the theme gets forgotten. No one is in character or there's not much going on besides a muted movie with the closed caption and the late piano player which we didn't get to enjoy much of.",-RCGPgSyowczaI1xpgOh1Q,0,0,4,pnHFdshdSRPJ_djV59lmmw
969109,2013-04-16,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Making a memory with a meal is all what its cracked up to be.  Friday night was the second time I had been to this place and it was just as great as I remember.  I scored a groupon $60 for $30 and decided to take some friends who were Capo-virgins.  I do recommend reservations as it does book up.  It took us a few minutes to find the door as it kind of gives you an ""alley way"" entrance to the place.  This is the first time at this location and I actually thought it was more amazing than the last one (on Trop) that I had been to.

Upon entry there is a little mobster suprise experience that you just have to see for yourself.  I don't want to spoil the fun even though I have seen others spill the beans reviews on here. Once you find yourself in the joint, and you are shown your table you will find yourself thinking what century am I in??  The place is dimly lit.  Probably the darkest restaurant I have ever been to but ya know its all about the secretive down low. lol  As we were seated, the 1970s round red leather booths are to die for (but don't say that out loud) along with velvet wallpaper and these amazing chandelliers above the tables....loved them!  They hand you the menus which accompany a little flash light so you can actually see it.  Nice idea.

For our meal I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Anastasia-lightly breaded and stuffed with ricotta and spinach.  The menu says its topped with pink sauce but it was topped with red sauce and a dab of pink sauce.  I just ordered some more pink sauce and I was good to go.  It came with some angel hair pasta with red sauce.  It was alooot of food to eat but it was so good.  I shared with the table some of the chicken.  I just couldnt eat even half of it.  The BF ordered the Capones Cabanara and he devoured that.  I'm not a fan of peas so I only tried a small bite but it was great.  My friend ordered the spaghetti with meatball (and it was huge).  She said the meatball was full of flavor and the best she ever had.  Her husband ordered the Mad Dog Marsala....which seemed not so big of a plate full but he loved every bite. On a side note I must say that this isnt the ""best"" Italian we've had but it was good and the experience makes it great!

The wine, bread and salads were a perfect addition.  We all ordered 2 drinks and our drinks were at least half the bill.   No joke.  Thanks for the drinks Groupon! haha  Actually I think the drinks were more than the Groupon but who is counting.  The service was awsome-very attentive and friendly with a Italian mobster edge. lol

Don't forget about the live music ""thats amore"".  Very special touch!  I must say I highly recommend this place.  It is very romantic-great for a date, fun to take some peeps to, and just to stop by and have a drink with the pin striped suits.  My friends loved the experience and the food so a good pat on the back to us for taking them.  Now who can I take next? ;)",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,0,4,HtKdpA3hcteYhNJl_5slQQ

I came here especially for the veal parmigiana. let's get started on the food I ordered linguine and clams with red sauce. well the clams was so like rubber I had to chew each claim for 10 minutes and still ending up swallowing the whole claM that's how rubber way they were. then I also ordered shrimp scampi and I had them put prosciutto and sundried tomatoes which I seen was already in another dish but do not like the garlic cream sauce and fettuccine I wanted angel hair with the shrimp scampi sauce so that's why I added to the sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto witch cost extra actual which I had no idea it was going to cost extra since it was already on the menu but anyways the prosciutto was actually deli ham it was not prosciutto at all. but other than that the shrimp scampi was the only good thing oh almost forgot the appetizers we ordered the calamari which was also rubber very very very bad rubber and undercooked and the breading did not stay on  as soon as you pick it up the breading will fall off and it was rubber and just terrible. we also got the fried mushrooms they were out of a can they were not fresh mushrooms They from a can. also got their famous meatball I did not see anything famous about it just an ordinary meatball. ask for the service I had a very bad waitress don't know her name kept giving me attitude and Service was just not what I expected very bad and did not feel welcome at all I was actually afraid for her to take a picture of me for my birthday. I seen the other waiters they have personality joking laughing suggesting menu items mine  did not do any of that. as for entertainment it wasn't the regular guy in the other reviews that sings Frank Sinatra Dean Martin it was some other guy that sang like Billie Joe or things like that and mostly played piano maybe for like 2 songs and then the rest was just recording music radio. restaurant is super small and stuffy I thought it would have been a bigger nicer restaurants.so that was it they messed up my birthday had the worst birthday ever not what I expected from other reviews foods with nothing great actually pretty bad service was pretty bad also the only thing that was nice with the decorations and old mafia pictures inside the restaurant and on the building that was it not too sure if I'll come back .there's also no magic man doing tricks I did see him going to table but he did not come to ours,V5xpKa2jG-EmyuQuvljTbA,2,1,1,oDN6q2us4jmo8bo7W11sMA

1100707,2016-12-04,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"O M G!!  Dined here last night with another couple.  My girlfriend Victoria and I were celebrating the end of our first (and last) fight.  What a great experience (Capo's, not the fight).  

We had a reservation and were seated quickly after arrival, once we made past the door keeper.  That, in and of itself, is a trip!  We were given menus and water promptly.  The menus were thoughtfully provided with small flashlights to make reading them easier in the subdued lighting.  Overall the ambiance  is pleasant and the staff knowledgable, personable, and attuned to the needs of their guests.  The place does tend to get a bit noisy what with a vocalist performing and dozens of tables filled with happy diners so if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner you would be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for exceptional service, exceptional food, and exceptional entertainment, you won't find any better in Southern Nevada.  My girlfriend's husband had Shrimp Scampi, she had Chicken Picata with Garlic Risotto, my wife had Spaghetti with Meatball (it's a HUGE meatball), and I had Lasagna with Crumbled Meatball.  Every dish we were served was abundant and fabulous.  

As for the entertainment, the vocalist is a nice touch.  He performed well and visited several tables while singing.  And the magician, well he is an absolute WOW!  He performs table side and mystifies.  I named a playing card at random (the eight of diamonds) and it magically appeared out of the deck.  He handed it to me along with a Sharpie (which we all sniffed) and I signed it.  He then proceeded to amaze us all by having the card move through the deck, apparently at his will.  He also did things with coins and table settings that had the four of us just shaking our heads in wonder.  

So here is the bottom line on this place; if you are looking for a fine dining experience with peaceful, calm surroundings, pass this place by.  However, if what you are seeking is a dining experience encompassing great Italian food prepared like mama would fix it and served by attentive staff, an atmosphere where everyone is enjoying life and entertainment that by far exceeds the price paid for the meal alone, then you best get to Capo's sooner rather than later!",WBUmw3eyAe0CoBESgeoakA,0,0,5,rpspjxI6bUWTEXqFiqDZuw

So we decided to go anyways not much could have changed. But when we got there 50% of things have changed, from the lighting it was too bright, The staff was always blaming things on other people. Our table was never cleared off of dirty dishes or food. We were never offered a second drink after an hour of being there. All this new picture taking and things are just not for this restaurant, I think they should go back to the way it was, or if they want to keep the high prices on the food for the Entertainement in the ambience to change it back the way they used to have it. Because there's no way that I'm willing to pay for a bland tasting chicken Alfredo meal for $28.  If a family wants to bring their children and friends there for a overprice meal I would say go for it but you could get a better meal someplace else for cheaper.

1123459,2010-04-28,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I really wanted to give Capo's a better rating, but I just couldn't. 
The lobby and greeting were very unique and fun. 
The ambiance in the restaurant was fun and interesting. Yes it was dark , but that was ok. Bathrooms are one person only and small , but again that's ok. 
The meal. 
First , we were on time for our reservation and our table was open , but we had to sit at the bar for 10 minutes, just enough time to order a drink which the tab had to be closed out before going to the table. My GF order one of their specialty cocktails, it was good. I asked for a glass of the house Chianti, the barmaid said they did not have one. Ok, I will wait and order something at the table. 
Once seated we were give the menu's with the flashlights, well one of the two had flashlights, and a wine list. Sure enough on the first page was a list of wine's by the glass and there was a Chianti.......sigh.... It was tasty and I had two of them. 
The menu was creative with all of the mob names. The bread was great , hot and fresh, but then you had to struggle with the butter in the little foil packets. 
Both of our salads had potential, but ended up being a little watery. She likes Ranch, not on the Capo's list. 
The calamari was very tasty, fried with some hot peppers and dipping sauce like Outbacks Bloomin Onion sauce. 
For dinner we went with the basics 
Her Lasagna was ok , very cheesy , and a bit over cooked. 
My spaghetti was cooked fine, it was just smother in red sauce and the kitchen sprinkled Parmesan cheese on it for me... I did not ask for it and I do not normally put it on my pasta. 
On the upside the Italian sausage I added to the dish was pretty good. 
We did not have dessert. 
Service throughout the dinner was good 
They called a cab for us and let me know when it arrived. 
The bill for two drinks each and dinner was $86.00 plus tip 
So the rating was more for the food then the rest of the dining experience.

You can taste that each meal is made with love and is truly authentic (to me at least). Doesn't taste anything like your regular chain Italian restaurant. The service is by far the absolute best. Everyone is very professional and friendly. My water glass was never empty for more than five minutes. Constantly checking up on you just to see how you like your food. Setting wise, it's great. It's dark inside, but that's the whole point. If you can't see the menu, use the flashlight that comes with it. There's a gentleman by the piano singing at dinner time. I thought he was lip syncing because it sounded so lovely. He's actually singing though. I go every time I'm in Vegas.

1126371,2012-10-24,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I really loved this place.  I have been driving by it forever and thought it was just some junky poker bar.  I saw the reviews on Yelp and was surprised at how high the reviews were given my impression of the outside.  The bf and I were looking for a happy hour spot and Capo's came up.  Remembering the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot.  The inside of the restaurant is beautiful.  Very romantic with live music.  Now I get it that it is consistent with a prohibition bar, mangy on the outside, luxurious on the inside.  

The bar manager was very helpful in terms of ordering suggestions.  We were there at happy hour so sat at the bar and enjoyed 1/2 off appetizers and the bf had a few 1/2 off drinks. 

There is a lot to see in this restaurant.  We watched the bar manager argue with the musician to sing more and drink less, the kitchen is open and watched all the food being prepared and the cooks talk back and forth between each other and wrangle over each other to get the food cooked, and watched the matre d' yell at people in the ""secret entrance"" about coming in.  Had we been sitting in the dinning room we would have missed all this.  And this may not be for all people, but we loved it.  I am so over personality-less drones asking me if I have ever tried their world famous chicken poppers, or something to that effect.  

We got there around 5pm and it was pretty slow, by the time we left at 7pm the place was packed.  It turns out that we were there on Tuesday which is there 2 - 1 Tuesday, 2 entrees for the price of 1.  The bf and I decided to come back on another Tuesday to try the entree menu.  

The only downside was that we ordered deserts to go, the bf got a red velvet cheesecake and I got the bread pudding.  I don't really like either cheesecake or red velvet (both are highly overrated as far as I'm concerned), but I did try a bite of his and could appreciate it.  Unfortunately the bread pudding was a fail.  It was more like cinnamon french toast, not really what I wanted.  I still won't reduce a star for that though, I just won't order it again.",9JKxJZV5r3maeG6uG_2VHw,2,1,5,WbqbCLqAheSxPYE6XXq0SA

Upon arriving, the restaurant is so dimly lit that they have mini flashlights so you can read the menu. I also think the lack of lighting hides the mediocrity of the food. 

I ordered the chicken piccatta. It wasn't very tender or flavorful. The accompanying pasta and marinara sauce was the worst I've eaten in a long time. The salad which preceded the entree was swimming in Italian dressing and grated Parmesan cheese. 

This place would have one star, but the service was attentive. The singer had a good voice and was pleasant to listen to during dinner. I tipped him $5 on my way out to show some appreciation for his talent.

They have a Frank Sinatra style vocalist singing in the dining area every 10-15 minutes. The food however was not outstanding, though it was very good.

1230994,2009-07-30,3,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Easily my favorite casual dining restaurant in Las Vegas! 

This place came highly recommended from a colleague, someone I didn't trust much, but she raved about the secret entrance, wonderful atmosphere and fantastic food and she looked like she knew a thing or two about food (if you know what I mean). 

My fiance and I decided to check it out on one of our date nights and were immediately confused as to which entrance to go through, the (free) valet kid helped us out, it's all part of the atmosphere. Why they have valet, I'll never understand, especially since the restaurant is the only thing occupying a majority of spaces in this small shopping center. 

Once inside, we were rudely asked, ""Can I help you?"" by a pair of eyes peaking through a secret sliding peep hole. Nervously, we told him of our reservation and to our enjoyment he opened the ""secret"" door, revealing a dark, noisy bar, chalk outlines on the floor, dim lighting, ornate chandeliers and wallpaper. A cheesy piano man was hitting the keys and singing Bobby Darin, a tip jar was perched at the edge of his mini grand while old mob movies played on flat screen TVs. Immediately, we fell in love with the place and still hadn't seen a menu. 

Anyone who knocks the atmosphere must be crazy, or simply prefers a quiet, intimate restaurant. Don't get me wrong, those kinds of places are fun, too, but this place is noisy, dark and heavily themed, I can't stress that enough and this is coming from someone who hates Rain Forest Cafe because of the atmosphere and theme.

Our waiter was wonderful, he had a thick Italian accent, I believe fake, but still hilarious and he told us about the menu and gave us time to look over the menu after taking our drink orders. Cocktails are a bit expensive, but there aren't many quality bars in Vegas that serve cheap cocktails, so the price was mostly forgiven. 

We each ordered a pasta dish, her the Lasagna and me the ""Angels with Dirty Faces,"" which is a bit heavy, but for a pepperoni fan like me, was extremely flavorful and delicious. Now, let me be honest about the food, this is in no way the best food in Las Vegas (so far, that belongs to Carne Vino at Palazzo, but that's another Yelp). This place is wonderful for its combination of theme, atmosphere and food, not one thing or the other. Remember Chuck E. Cheese's when you were a kid? That karma of arcade games, ball pit and mediocre pizza? Remember how fun that was? Now, improve the pizza, replace arcade games and ball pit with atmosphere and cocktails and you've got the kind of harmonious perfection that makes Capos such a fun, memorable place. 

We've been here too many times to count and bring our out-of-town friends all the time and they love it. We've never had a bad experience.

I stayed at the Luxor hotel and didn't rent a car, so I had to put a pretty big effort getting here which was a combination bus and taxi service. I needed a bus pass for other places, but the taxi was 22.00 with tip. I could have used my bus pass for Sahara west, but wasn't sure of the stops, but was able to use the bus to get back to the strip.
               When you get there you find the secret entrance and ring the bell, and the guy opens the slot and with the secret password(""Auntie G sent me"") opens the door and lets you in. It was just me so they save the tables for couples and groups, so I sat at the bar. Service was fast and I liked the lady bartender, who recommended the steak. I first had the meatball appetizer, which had the most amazing sauce, with a bite to it I can't really describe. Most definitely not a sweet sauce. The steak was very good, cooked medium like I requested, and a very big cut with a lot of flavor, but it just wasn't the best I've ever had. If it had just been a bit more tender, and please don't tell me I requested it overcooked at medium. I've cooked so many steaks on the grill that I know even medium well to well done can be tender with a really good cut of meat from the butcher. I keep in mind that a steak on the strip could have been double the price here, and my bill including 3 pints of beer was only 61.00 before gratuity. Not bad for a popular spot in Vegas! I just wish I trusted my instincts, and had one of their Italian dishes instead of the steak. Especially after sampling the meatball. Still a great meal, and I love the décor and ambiance of the restaurant. Very dark and the menus have tiny flashlights attached so you can read the selections. By the time I left(arrived early) the live entertainment had started! I'm happy I planned and made the effort!",LR_w8sCegEXF6A3yy85q9g,0,0,4,IPOqgh2uB0j2ToVDSApo9A

Although i would have preferred a slightly larger portion for dinner, the experience was very positive thanks to Erin's friendly service. Lunch however was a surprise, and even though I did expect the opposite since we ordered from their lunch special menu, the portions were actually very filling. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which was loaded and delicious (although I suggest asking for a little less sauce or even on the side to avoid the sogginess on the bread of you let it sit more than a few minutes) What made the afternoon even better was the excellent service and super friendly attitude of both Josh our bus person and Angela our waitress. Nether of them had been there for long, but they acted as if they did with excellent knowledge of the food and friendly service which made our stay more enjoyable. Everything you expect from a true Italian restaurant, from the romantic atmosphere with dimmed chandeliers candles (make sure you bring your phone for use of the flashlight when reading the menu) and a live piano (at night), not to mention the consistent playing of old Frank Sinatra and mob movies on some screens on one side of the room. We were too full to try the deserts but we will definitely go again soon. It is definitely one of the hidden local spots.

First off, the ambiance is everything you want an Italian restaurant to be. The moment we entered, we were transported back to a place and time you can only find in history books and museums. It was the dimly lit lounge of yesteryear, with the rich sounds of Dean Martin and Bobby Darin filling your ears, while the intoxicating aroma from the kitchen gets your mouth watering before you even sit down. 

Francisco and Carlos took explicit care in making our evening great. Our glasses were never empty, and our every need was met immediately and with a smile. Francisco led us through the menu to select what was to be one of the finest dinners we've ever had. The meatballs... oh my god, the meatballs. I don't even have the words. 

Come with a group so you can try different entrees! Tonight we enjoyed Eggplant Parmesan, Lasagne, Santucci's Pasta, and Stuffed Chicken Anastasia. Every single bite was more than delicious. We left the restaurant with full bellies and a sense of euphoria I struggle to describe.

My husband and i went here during one of our many trips to Vegas. 
From the outside it doesn't look like anything too special but that almost adds to its charm. 
You enter though a secret door like the old school mob movies. It has a very intimate feeling when you walk in. Seating is private and comfortable,Live music that was AMAZING.. walks up to the table to sing to you but not too much. So for me the atmosphere and service was already giving them major points in my book. 
Now the food ... WOWWWW We started with the meatballs as an appetizer,best meatballs I have ever had, and I even loved the red sauce it was in( i'm super picky because my family makes our own) The pasta we ordered tasted homemade and fresh, so  amazing. we each got a diff pasta and we both loved each.The pricing is great!!  service is top notch reminded me of eating at Mortins Steakhouse but a much for nostalgic experience. We had such a great time dining we didn't want to leave so moved over to the bar area where we continued to listed to songs we loved from our fav Frank Sinatra and others from that era.

The food was unfortunately disappointing. I ordered the Caesar Salad lunch & Chicago Beef. The salad dressing was very tasty but completely drenched in it. I do tend to go easy on dressing so I'd order the dressing on the side & you'll be good to go. The Chicago Beef from a place that is supposed to be Capone should excel at Chicago classics. That's why I ordered the Chicago Beef. Such a bum-mer. The sandwich one wasn't dipped in the au jus. The au jus was very salty, heavy handed rosemary & not enough beef for the cost of the lunch special even. The fries were a luke warm soggy snooze fest. Just so disappointing. The service was good, attentive & the food came out promptly. Again the ambiance was fun, fun.

Before the cab picked us up from Bally's 3 of us split an edible that was the size of a mini tootsie roll. We all got into the car and started our drive away from the strip. 
Now let me just warn you this place is NOT by the strip. Anyways we get there and the entrance was amazing, you don't even know you're in the right place! At least not till the mafia boss let's you in the back from the magic wall. 

So we get seated in the Frank Sinatra booth and order apps and dinner. Our server was AMAZING, the food AMAZING, atmosphere AMAZING. It wasn't till right before the dessert came that the edible hit us like a southern grandma in church! We could not stop laughing and started losing all sense of reality and feeling in our legs. My friend and I had to use the restroom which is not easy when you can't tell your legs to move or get up. I some how made it to the bathroom.

Ok let me start out by saying I've been going yo capos for about 7 years and it was great back when it was on tropicana. Last year I took my girlfriend for a romantic dinner and we were there for 3 hours and didn't even get our salads, this was due to the fact they were filming a ""real housewife""eating dinner. So we got a glass of water and I had 1 beer and asked to speak to someone about an hour and a half into it. Noone came so we continued to wait when someone finally came over he tried to give me an attitude and hand me a bill for my food, I looked at him and laughed and said I'm not paying got anything and left and vowed to never to go back. Well needless to say I had to give my favorite restaurant for 7 years one last shot me and a group of 10 friends went there on sat. For my birthday dinner everyone said there food was not good including mine, I had the veal parm and there was a pound of cheese covering it to start, it was very bland and not the same as the old recipe. We were there waiting for out check for an hour after we ate w didn't even see our server, and the place only had 3 tables of people so it's not like they were busy.

First off, the place is really cool even from the moment you walk inside. Totally 1920's dark ambiance, mobster themed and it was really different and fun. They have a gentleman singing live music from the 1920's and a magician going around to the tables. It was a fun and unique dining experience. The only downside was having to wait almost 20 minutes for a table we had a reservation for.

As for the food, the table bread sucked which you would expect it to be at least warm and tasty from an Italian restaurant. Our server was very nice and I ordered a glass of wine which he forgot to put in and gave me two glasses for the price of one (Ill take a late drink any day for that). All entrees come with a soup or salad. Our server recommended the Cesar salad which I thought was sub-par and my entree actually came with an additional cesar salad on the plate with it so I would have preferred if he told me that and I would have gone with a soup as a starter instead. 

I had just watched a food network or travel channel show on off-menu special items in Las Vegas. Capo's has a secret menu item called ""Leftovers"" and it looked amazing on the show. So I ordered it. It was a really interesting dish and I can see why it is called the Leftovers. Its a grilled chabbata and cheese bread on the bottom with a mountain of sausage and sauce covering the bread with two fried eggs on top. I thought it was delicious. My husband ordered the chicken parm and it was so yummy I will probably get that next time.

Overall, very cool place with good food. We will definitely be back, but most likely on Tuesday night because its a good deal.",MHCerAmy_1TGc85p4Qr-5A,6,2,3,H0_J_YLWZOu681bj04w1dg
1408747,2012-12-09,8,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"FINALLY SOME REAL ITALIAN FOOD IN VEGAS :D
Believe me we have had everything from $-$$$$ Italian here in Vegas.
Call ahead and make reservations.
It's an experience just walking through the door :) I will not post a spoiler :)

Sit back and relax, everything is very carefully made to order and extremely fresh. 
Yes it has very low lighting and yes it has a piano playing man singing karaoke machine microphone songs but his voice is very good, so no worries.
It is true about there being small LED lights attached to the menu so you can use them if needed.

Every dish we had was spot on and the house Merlot was really amazing.
Our waitress was smiley and nice and she did not come to the table much, only when needed, I like that! 
We started after being greeted with water as we still had our Merlot from the bar area. (Bartenders are pretty ladies in black tiny corsets. Very nice and complimented me!)

Started with house loaf of fresh baked sourdough/Italian/French type of bread. Firm on outside and airy on inside (my fav kind) the butter that came with it was flavored with garlic, chive and possibly sage.

We ordered everything at once, we knew what we wanted :)

We started with Bruschetta and yummmmmm it was a treat! Fresh and chilled it seemed like a fresh Italian salsa almost! It was the perfect blend of garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil, EVOO, balsamic and a tiny bit of parm maybe. The bread was the same only toasted and looked brushed prior to toast with butter?
Hubby had a Caeser salad which was perfect (not too much anchovies) and fresh with just the right amount of dressing!
Our friend he had a house with Blue Cheese and it was gone before I could try (my fav thing is BC) and he said it was perfect :)
When I ordered a really always do salad but the soup was calling my name, thank goodness I asked her what it was and if she likes it, she said ""it's very popular and very good"" sold! The soup is a creamy tomato base soup with white bean and small pene like noodles, if I had a grilled cheese......it would be heaven on earth. Not too many beans, not too many noodles a dash of fine grated cheese on top. Perfect. 

Between courses it's very relaxed and the dim lighting is sooooo nice. We sat in a booth straight across from the entrance area (the place is large) and hubby sat in the middle inside the booth. 
He mentioned ""a real boss knows to always have your back, as in you sit against the wall :)"" as he said that I noticed all the mirrors above the booth :) 
You just feel Goodfellas. Even the door guy is a ""tough guy"" and comes out of the back ""slapping shut"" the check holders about once every half hour :)

After ordering another glass of wine and enjoying each others company here come our entrees :)

Our friend had chicken parm with the side of pasta spaghetti and gravy it usually comes with. He said it was wonderful.

Hubby had the veal parm a beautiful cutlet smothered with gravy and mozzarella and instead of the pasta he got garlic mash. We are garlic lovers and warning IN EVERYTHING THERE IS A LOT :) not too much for us. (yes there is a toooo much) 
The garlic mash was a fresh skin on garlic, butter, a dash of cream, thick mash. It was how I make mine and it was delish.

I ordered veal picatta. It was a thin cutlet not coated but very very tender in a heavenly picatta. A perfect blend of white wine, butter, EVOO, capers and just a dash of parsley. For my sub out of pasta I had mushroom risotto, it was EXTREMELY rich and creamy, on the firm side and full of fresh parm. The side dish dipped in my buttery dish wow................just wow.

Slowly but gracefully we tried each others yumm'd and ahhhh'd......and at the end we forgot we were told to ""try the chocolate cannolis"" 

She came by and we were all stuffed and happy but I asked anyway ""how big and how many are in an order lol"". She said ""just two and about like this"" (maybe 4"")
Cannolis were divine!!!!!! Perfect, rich crispy, creamy.

That was our experience! We were told about this place from Brian (owner of Wing King) who had his birthday dinner there the other night.

That's our experience! PS when I say gravy I mean tomato sauce :) Portions are large so I would split if you get an app. But always save room for a bite of cannoli!!!!!

I'm so glad we came. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Next time I want to order a vegetarian dish that I saw and try a different app.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,20,12,5,U8n6XlgkT-aKPSTJeqGOVw

We were seated near the kitchen entrance and patio door so the continuous yelling of ""corner"" by the waiters was quite annoying. Additionally it was very drafty when the patio door was opened. The piano singer was entertaining. Our waiter was polite but not overly attentive.

A small detail that I really liked is that the booths are high so when my fiancee and I were cozying up it didn't feel like everybody was watching us, nobody could see us and we couldn't see anybody else which was great.

The service was fantastic, not only efficient but friendly and the food was a solid 8/10.  The price is relatively reasonable.  I am going back in a few weeks for my bachelor party so lets see how they deal with a large rowdy group.!!!

The beauty is in the details at Capo's. When you arrive, you walk into a small vestibule. Soon, a small window slides open and a slightly frightening italian man asks what you want. If you manage to convince him you deserve entrance (don't worry- you will), he disappears, only to reappear shortly thereafter to open the door wide, allowing you into the dimly lit restaurant. The chairs and booths are comfortable. The music is fun and often sung by a guy trying for all his might to be Sinatra. Old ganster movies such as the OG Ocean's 11 are playing on a large flatscreen above the bar. The walls are decorated with pictures of infamous mobsters and the boothes are all red velvet and leather.

The food. My. God. The. Food. Take a lactaide before you get there- these people are serious about cheese. And garlic. This is everything you love but know you shouldn't about Italian cusine. I highly recommend the bruschetta (a beautiful harmony of tomatoes, onion and pesto with a bit of a kick) and ""The Chef Sleeps with da Fishes"" (an alfredo dish with at least a dozen large, tender shirmp swimming in creamy cheesey goodness). 

This is a great place for groups and families. We had a party of 25 including 5 children and 4 teenagers. Everyone LOVED both the food and the ambiance. There was another large group of about 20 and we had absolutely NO problem with service. Everyone was very attentive with the doorman, waiter, busboy and party planner all coming by to make sure everyone was taken care of. 

The skinny:
Credit cards are accepted.
Entrees range from $10.50 for spaghetti w/ meatballs to $25 for specialty dishes
Several desserts are available for about $7 each
Full bar and good wine selection available
Reservations are HIGHLY recommended as the place is not big

Since they have moved from the Trop location to Sahara this restaurant has gone seriously down hill, each time I go worse than the visit before.
I was greeted by the door guy, always somewhat gruff, but this time was very rude. Like why was I here, dinner?  Imagine that.   Then while we were enjoying a pre dinner drink at the bar, we requested a table.  The ""host"" which was the same guy from the door, seats us at a booth, one of several that were vacant.  Then he tells us that they are all reserved and he can give it to us if we make it ""worth his while"". So we tip him $5 as we walked all of 2 feet from the bar and figured he was just acting out the Chicago wise guy persona.
He said, you can give me another one of those and stood there expecting more tip.
Very odd indeed. It's not like he put much effort into it, and the booths remained empty throughout our dinner so they were not all reseved after all.
The dinner was okay, service was decent, food was decent, but overall the restaurant had a dirty, dingy feel to it.
The icing on the cake was the experience at the table next to us, where one of the guest was stung by a scorpion while he ate dinner.  He even took a picture of it! So, if there are scorpions, which to Capos' defense, are native to the SW part of town, then you know there are other bugs and they definitely are not proactively preventing them from being in their facility.
Overall, I would saw last night's visit will definitely be the last.

The place was very dim with lots of awesome decor from the mafia world. While casual dress is ok, I felt under-dressed wearing jeans as many were dressed a little bit more formal.

Then the tables that were empty were already reserved. So, my friends and I ended up dining at the bar. Oh boy! I was happy that we ended up at the bar! You can see all the live actions while they cook and prepare your meals. They have TVs at the bar and a live singer by the piano at the center of the restaurant (I came in at the right night). It's really awesome! 

I ordered Tony Duck's soup and Spaghetti with Meatballs. The soup does not contain any duck. It has spinach and eggs with such a flavorful broth! I came here to try out their spaghetti with meatballs and it was delicious! The homemade meatball was bigger than my fist. It was moist and did not fall apart when slicing. The marinara was well flavored and good consistency. I prefer my pasta a little thicker though.

Capo's has come up with a way to distinguish their ""mobster"" theme.  Guests arrive to an empty foyer with little besides a pay phone and a few framed pictures on the wall.  What is this?  You follow the directions and ring a bell, whereupon a secret hatch opens up and a Jersey-accented thug asks what we want.  After a little back-and-forth the wall holding the pay phone opens to a dimly-lit wonderland of mobster memorabilia.  It's lots of fun!  Walking past the kitchen you see the staff busily preparing the food.  This is pretty much the last you will see of the food at Capo's.

The atmosphere is super fun and the food was tasty too.  I would probably have given them more stars if I could have been able to see what I was eating.  The menus arrive with tiny lights attached to aid in actually reading them.  All around the dining room other patrons are using their cell-phones to catch a glimpse of what they are eating.  There is no reason for this place to be so dark.  Part of the culinary experience for me is to look at the presentation and I completely missed out on it at Capo's.

Also, we were seated right next to the singer and, while he was good, it was rather intrusive to be so close to him.  Lastly, while the food was good.. it wasn't stupendous.

Now, for what we liked.. the ambiance (other than the lighting) was good.  Service was great.  Food was good.  Prices seemed reasonable.  And.. the singer was staying in key most of the time.

We ordered the antipasto - rather excellent.  Our salads (with italian dressing) were boring afterwards, a bit too much lettuce since the antipasto was a salad also.  The bread was good, but they were stingy with the butter.  My entree was ""The Chef Sleeps with the Fishes"", a shrimp fettucine that I liked.

If you have the password they'll let you in. Upon entering you feel like you are sent back in time. There was a Dean Martin type singer working the crowd while crooning out birthday songs and classics. 

The place was packed so we were glad to have reservations. We were sat in a side room away from the action. At first I was a bit disappointed and distracted by the noises coming from the kitchen. Once the singer started up again, the kitchen was much less distracting and I decided it was actually nice to be a bit separated. It was so packed I imagine it'd be hard to have a conversation otherwise.

We ordered Busta Cap stuffed mushrooms....EXCELLENT! My wife ordered lasagna and it was huge and incredible. I had Marsala, which was pretty good, with a side of pasta ala Vodka, very good. For desert we had chocolate mousse, which was good.

Our waiter, perhaps Franco or Frankie, was great, as was the rest of the staff. Drinks always full, always serving the dishes with an ""enjoy"" or ""enjoy your meal"". Franco would give us recommendations and when we would ask questions he would reply with, ""yeah, of course,"" ""you're gonna love it,"" ""forget about it."" He even had the right accent.

The outside resembles what looks to be some piece of crap shed however when you enter the world transforms into a 1920's speakeasy. From the time I entered to the bill I knew I was going to enjoy this place. My favorite is their chicken marsala it is to die for. But back to the atmosphere, its great maybe a little bit to dark but I understand why. The host looks like he just finished a hit on someone based on his size which gives it more of that authentic look. Best part is they have a pianist on certain days, which can sing some amazing Sinatra. The food and drinks yes might be a little on the pricy side but defiantly worth every penny. The wait staff is great two I have had the same waitress twice and both times she was great the other 4 times I went there it was different people yet still really good at their jobs. I even ended up stay after close on day to enjoy a beer with some of the people that worked there. A++ I haven't been to their other location but I can only assume its just as good.",Uc-1K1slA3tcZHNzUhvjGg,0,0,5,XBQ9gsSNXtTN48K27P9zPA

The meatballs and lasagna are my fave dishes but everything tastes good. If you're fascinated by the mob or rat pack era, you need to eat here. Don't mistake its dingy exterior for what waits within.

1570153,2017-07-20,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I have been dining at Capos for over two years now and this review is so overdue. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, I have dined here over 10 times! (I always forget to check in) I absolutely love the mobster vibe this place gives out. I have only dined here in the evenings date nights, family gatherings and fine dinings.

Each time you dine here you gotta buzz in and the guy with the mob (host) will ask for the password or reservation. Once you tell him you do or not (name and time) he'll open the door and let you in. As you walk in, it's pretty dark which I love! Definitely different from all other restaurants I have dined at. 

There is live entertainment from a nice gentleman who sounds like Sinatra which I thought was a recording but his actual voice. He sung my boyfriend and I a song and even included my name! Came I give this place 10 stars!!!??

The servers are friendly and nice, drinks are delicious I recommend the raspberry Italian Margarita so good!

The food is to die for. I am never disappointed here at all. If you want an adventurous night filled with good eats and entertainment you must come! I also recommend to make a reservation because this place is very popular; tables and bar setting fills up quick.

Try it, you won't be disappointed at all!",iOERwab2ItTyaUNqOWWGqQ,2,4,5,aeQdQmiJPKBZCWHpeGDAYg

Only thing that I would highly recommend against is going with a big group of people unless 1 person is footing the bill or everyone brings lots of cash because they don't allow splitting of the check between multiple people and it seemed like such a big debacle and the waitress couldn't figure it out. Other than that, good food and ok atmosphere. Kind of loud but it was nice. Really only 2.5 stars",6y3brTYD1GHdTeaC9Iht_w,0,0,3,umnoQ7VaNMt0ps9YGIn5YQ

The mobster movies  (Godfather III was on), Sinatra sound-alike on piano and waiter with an attitude were all appreciated.  The food was very good and reasonably priced, although nothing really out of the ordinary.  I had Eggplant Parmesan and the others had the Salmon Special (good & garlic-y), Chicken Angelo (portion on the small side) and Chicken Parmesan.  After our cocktails, bread, and salads were served, our waiter went MIA... hey, buddy, we want some vino with our food!  He hadn't been one of the servers of our main courses, and it took a good 10 minutes for the busboy to get the waiter back to our table to take our wine order.  We ended with cappuccino and coffee.

1576971,2018-02-25,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I have been here multiple times.  I have been here for multiple occasions.  I have always talked up Capo's Italian Cuisine (CIC), no doubt!  As a matter of fact, I talked up CIC to at least 3 other people before my most recent visit this week (02/22).  I mean...REALLY talked up!  CIC has taken on an almost magical type of of existence to me.  Why the 3 stars then?  I'll get to that eventually.  Let me first discuss why I ""dug"" this place......

Gangster...ole' school gangster.  I don't want to give too much away.  Mafioso themed...no doubt.  

Dark...very dark.  That is lighting and ambience.  Has nothing to do with the wait staff, and the food.....more on that in just a bit.

Cool lyrical(s)....you might get some soothing sounds by some cool ass crooner singing a little Sinatra or a little Dino.  I have found the volume to vary...but never over whelming.

Magic?!  Yup!  Depending on the night/time you visit, your gonna get some of the best up close, in your face MAGIC...you have ever seen!

The wait staff......Always friendly and during my most recent visit...defused the situation.  Not the maître d'....not the manager...more on that later.

The food.  Absolutely phenomenal!  So much so that during lunch and during dinner...I leave the upper north end of the valley and go to parts I would rather not after work..or during high travel hours...or travel multiple miles period!  I love the following....

Cheesy bread....Check.

Nico's Caesar....Check.

""Chicken Lucchese""....Chicken breast breaded topped with mozzarella, broccoli, mushroom, capers, lemon, butter, white wine & a touch of crushed red pepper / 24.95 (Retrieved from http://caposrestaurant.blogspot.com/p/menu.html)....Check.

""Angels with Dirty Faces"" 
Angel hair pasta with peas, mushrooms & pepperoni,  tossed with Capo's pink sauce / 18.95 (Retrieved from http://caposrestaurant.blogspot.com/p/menu.html)....Check.

And now......the negative....what has placed a seed of doubt in my head..perhaps...forever.

The GF and I decided to spend a belated Valentine's Day dinner here on 02/22/18.  After working, rushed home to make myself somewhat presentable.  Changed out and got on the road and arrived 10 minutes before our ""RESERVATIONS"" at 7:30 PM.  The atmo was that of pure chaos.  Not what I have become accustomed too at CIC.  There was a ""hurry up and get in here"" type of vibe, followed up with the maître d' will be right with you....NOT.  The waiting area leaves something to be desired and bodies started staking up.  Some of those before became frustrated and punched out.  Bodies continued to stack.  The ""maître d'"" occasionally showed up, but there was little to no attention shown to ""RESERVATION"" times.  I can verify this because.....RANDOMLY, the GF saw a friend and another party that showed with.....NO RESERVATIONS...get seated before us.  It was almost 40 minutes before we were shown a table.  A table that was presented to dine at or we could wait for a booth that was being prepared.  Hell, we waited that long, lets wait for the booth.  Almost 45 minutes....we finally sat down to eat.

Our experience with those in charge was nothing but shall I say.....glib.  Hands down the worst ""reservation"" experience I have had in my almost 22 years in Vegas.  

Enough...no more dinners.  Maybe I'll return during the lunching hour.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,3,2,3,PJEUpcCnPzvA4VLp-aan9Q

1612475,2017-09-11,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I ended up at Capo's after turning up too late to seat on a Sunday night at a couple of other venues.

The décor here is pretty lush ... and I suppose that's the main attraction. Red (or black) curved banquette seating. Black velvet fleur-de-lis reps on gold-foil wallpaper. Lots of dark woods everywhere. Brass & gold chandeliers over the tables. Very dark lighting. That sort of thing. 

Adding to it was the ambient music, delivered by a piano player ... on a real piano ... who tickled ivory all across the Great American Songbook. 

In certain other ways, the whole old-school Italian message went a wee bit over-the-top. Huge mugshot photos of Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Lucky Luciano, Frank Sinatra, et. al. The TV closest to me was running ""Donnie Brasco."" And half the items on the menu were tagged in similar fashion, such as ""Rigatoni Trafficante"" and ""The Gallows with Clams."" Yes, the latter is linguine. And there is a bit of gangster theater at-the-front-door, Ring the bell, the greeter opens a secret panel through a small picture hanging on the wall, you ask to get in. Then a door--a door-in-the-wall-that-wasn't-there, not the door-that-looked-like-the-door--opens to let you in. Oh my, Mabel, this must be a speakeasy!

OK that part of the atmosphere, again, seems a little bit too overcooked for my palate. It's not my money, but if it were, I would take that stuff down a notch. I suppose it's for tourist-effect, who'll go home saying this is joint is 'authentic vintage Vegas.' Or something like that.

But the actual dining spaces are very MidCentury gourmet-room lush, and so one can easily overlook all the other.

I went with the Italian house salad, included with the 14-ounce no-bone ribeye, mixed veggies & mashed potatoes. A pretty durn good meal. The salad dressing was seasoned oh-so-well and the ribeye was also charcoaled quite well - and juicy. That was a $40 plate, btw. I took a pass on the 24-ounce porterhouse 'special' at $60. Those prices are a wee bit higher than I would marry to the overall experience, but hardly enough of a difference to call them a deal-breaker.

There's a Tuesday 2-fer-$20-off deal, if you pony up for a couple of cocktails. I am basically immune to alcohol consumption, so I didn't look at the cocktail prices ... and so I can't tell you if the $20 is already buried in them. And there's also a ""Sinatra brunch"" on Sundays from 11am until 2pm. Let's just hope that by ""Sinatra"" they don't mean it's endless shots of Jack Daniels chased with a bowl of olives!

I liked this place, clearly, for the core of its décor and its respectable food. So I think I'll keep it on-the-radar primarily as a solid atmosphere option during an evening out with a lady companion.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,1,4,YHtXOKOiHbmwiDs8Zp3PBw
1622208,2010-03-10,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"So...it's been almost a month since my most recent visit and my anger is finally starting to subside long enough for me to update my past review for this place.
I should also note that I have eaten at Capo's (both locations) many times since my first review. It had become a place we take out of town guests, celebrate birthdays, and basically go for our ""favorites"" on ""just because nights"". I have also recommended this restaurant to everyone I encounter that is looking for a great experience and great meal. Well, that is now in the past.

When Valentines Day started to approach this year Capos was the front runner for our night out. We made reservations two weeks in advance and then about a week before we called to add another couple to our guest count. We were all so excited and looking forward to it!! Both people on the phone were very nice and we added to our reservation with ease. We always order the same things when we go and we were looking forward to sharing the evening with good friends.

When we arrived we were quickly led to our table. As we settled into our table we realized that a paper menu had been placed in front of us as opposed to the regular one. When the back server came to the table first to fill our water glasses we told him that we were not given menus. He began to tell us that the regular menu was not available that evening and the paper menu was the one that was. I quickly glanced at the menu noticing that our favorite dishes were no where to be found. It was clear that this was a special ""set menu"" with of course, inflated prices. When the server approached our table we asked politely if we could speak to a manager. Several minutes later a woman approached our table, presumably the manager. I began to explain that we had come to enjoy their wonderful regular menu and were disappointed that in the two phone conversations I had making the reservations NO ONE had told us that a limited menu would be served that night.

Ok...breathe....

The woman responded not with an apology or an offer of a solution, but rather, with insult to myself and my guests. She said that ""we"" should have just expected that because of the holiday there would be a set menu. She continued to explain that they had called many other restaurants in the area and that ""80% of them were offering the same thing"". To add further insult, she then pointed around the room at the other tables and said, ""no one else seems to have a problem with it"". That was it. That was the moment when Capo's went from my favorite restaurant in the city to one I will never eat at again. My party and I got up and left of course and ended up at another great family owned, Italian restaurant in town where we enjoyed a wonderful four course meal with great wine, fantastic homemade food, and great friends.

I have been in the food and beverage industry for 13 years and I was completely shocked by how a manager could treat guests. Also, if you are going to have a ""set menu"" on a particular night, then fine, but inform your guests. To be quite honest, had we been told during the reservation process of the limited menu would would have just made a reservation for the following night (we were all off from work the next night too and the chance to order all of the stuff we come back for would have been worth waiting a day)",owHfg5zujAEEgeKExzWXmg,7,0,1,JVD5Blzj7zCfpChZemJd7w

When we got there for dinner the night of the reservation, we ended up at a table in the back next to the kitchen, no where near the entertainment and constant distractions from the kitchen and the back door where the employees where going to smoke.

When the appetizers came, the waiter forgot one of the two we ordered.  He finally came back after our salad was served.  Blaming the kitchen for forgetting instead of himself....

Capos was not really on our radar and it wasn't until we drove past it on our way back from doing some decorating at his office that we decided Italian sounded great. We turned around and got into the parking lot of Capos.

I have to say that I really like the feel and the ambiance of this place. Although it is very dark when you first walk in so make sure to allow time for your eyes to adjust. My husband made a comment that this was the type of place one would bring their mistress. It was dark with high red booths offering privacy and comfort. 

Our server was excellent. She was knowledgable, friendly and energetic. She took our drink orders promptly after we were seated. They do have a happy hour menu mon-sat but it is only at the bar.

We opted for one cocktail each... They ranged between $12-14 per.

We started off with their fresh calamari which was lightly battered and complemented by sliced Peperoncinis for that added zest. $14,95

For my entree  I opted for ""Angels a With Dirty Faces"" which was angel hair pasta in pink sauce with peas and mushrooms. I added grilled chicken for an extra fee. $18.95 + $6 for the chicken to be added

My husband had ""Racketeers Ravioli"" which were homemade pasta pillows stuffed with ricotta cheese and he opted for Alfredo sauce as the topping sauce of choice. The ravioli tasted homemade and exactly the way my mom used to make them.  $18.95

We overheard the server explain to a booth behind us that nothing in house is frozen or pre made. She stated that they have a small freezer which houses some of the desserts. That is what I like to hear. You pay the premium for it, but that's what I like to hear.

All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad. I loved their garlic sauce that was on my salad. So delicious!!

The only con were the prices. Even with 2 for 1 entree for locals, we ended up shelling over $70 for the two of us. 

Although the food and service were great, I am not thrilled with the price point enough to rush back. I can see the prices being justified because everything is made fresh and portions are fair, but Italian food ingridients generally don't warrant that kind of price unless we are adding seafood, etc.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,13,7,4,nrKxIuUK-9PrPnBRLU8Xrg

Not only were we charged for the split, we were charged $3 more ($8) for it, because ""they recently raised the price"" (but didn't update the menu?).  On top of that we ordered the spaghetti Santucci which was good, but we thought the meatballs were included as one of the choices in the dish.  They added another $5 on for the meatballs too.  Our waiter got the manager when we complained.  He just apologized as did the waiter and said it was a management decision.  

So--I can't recommend the restaurant due to their billing practices.",srTosqUmHUwpRgf_4r3LFQ,0,0,2,ZfRHDuueNmWWHPz53rctWg

1705316,2015-07-07,2,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Atmosphere:
It's set up to be themed like a Mob Speakeasy and I absolutely love the theme down to the trick door.

We went on a Sunday night and the dinner crowd was beginning to thin. It was extremely dark. How dark? The some of the menus had flashlights attached to them.

They had a live performer singing and playing the piano which I thought was a nice touch.


Food:
I really wish I could say I enjoyed the food here. Maybe it was because we came on a Sunday night or it was just an off night for them but I was not impressed at all. Food was comparable to your local Olive Garden.

We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. My comment about it being comparable to Olive Garden might be harsh but this dish is exactly why I said it. The color and texture both reminded me of the calamari at Olive Garden.

Our main dishes were the Vinne's Alla Vodka and Santucci's Pasta. 

Santucci's Pasta was very plain. I don't understand the hype about Capone's sauce. Short of them accidentally serving us another sauce on it I was not impressed.

Vinne's Alla Vodka was just disappointing. I'm a sucker for Vodka sauce so I hoped this would be the saving grace. It wasn't. The penne taste like it was only half cooked.


Service:
Through it all I can honestly say it was the service that saved this from dropping to a two. Our waitress was absolutely amazing. She gave us a heads up about wait times and when were done even offered to call us a cab. Unfortunately we weren't the only tourists there and kept getting our cabs stolen by other patrons.

11pm came around and our waitress saw we were still waiting outside. The restaurant closed at 10pm. She waited with us until our cab came and got us.

I don't plan on going back. One and done was enough for me.",l5cxtEb38HqqSqXJdG1_lw,1,0,3,YVvUDVAqLghZWczv4VBeag

I'd say this is more for adults than kids, though. Dinner prices are a bit on the high side, but they occasionally come up on Groupon.

CAPO'S HOUSE  SALAD or NICO'S CAESAR SALAD ($7): Overpriced and overdressed, they use tons of dressing, but do taste good. Opt for the garlic version on the House, splurge the extra $3 to add chicken to the Caesar.
AUNTIE G'S ANTIPASTO SANDWICH ($12): Chicken breast and various antipasto meats and cheeses layered on a tasty focaccia with roasted red peppers, spinach, and a delightful lemon-pesto aioli. Side choice of pasta salad or fries, topped with additional aioli. Large portion, very fresh.
SANTUCCI'S PASTA ($10): classic spaghetti with ""Capone family secret sauce"", add a giant meatball for $5 to make it a real meal. Pasta was a bit mushy but the 'ball was pretty good, BF said he'd get this again.

Food quality for lunch was probably a 3/5 but attentive service and atmosphere kicks the overall rating up to a 4 for me.

The cooks need to taste the food for better seasoning.",oHvYhaTFxLOvZH2rFuUjvg,0,1,3,LzBo3E27PhFuc5-a5_668A

The risotto was unreal. It was so good. It had a strong flavor or garlic and cheese. It was awesome.

We ordered the antipasto appetizer, but it arrived without cheese. HUH?! How does one NOT put cheese on an antipasto? Isn't that like Italian Cooking 101? The meats, lettuce and balsamic dressing were wonderful, but it needed the cheese for balance. After what seemed to be a communication issue with our server, to where he actually told me that the dish does not come with cheese ... I then showed him the description on the menu which clearly stated ""meats AND cheeses"".  Only then did he seem to get it, apologize, and offer to get us another. We both had the Pasta Fagioli soup and enjoyed it very much along with the yummy bread basket.

I enjoyed Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata Rigatoni with spicey garlic sauce. I also ordered a meatball (really good), which was initially forgotten and no doubt was off cavorting somewhere with my lost antipasto cheeses.  But our waiter fetched me a meatball and I was happy. My date enjoyed his cheesey mushroom ravioli dish, although it seemed a little overcooked and pasty to my taste.

The Tiramisu was delicious with an after-dinner espresso to kick my energy level back up to pre-pasta levels.

All in all, Capo's is a different kind of dining experience and their food is good, but I was not wow'd.  Would probably return, but not in any hurry to do so, and must remember to request the dining room next time.",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,3,1,3,bj-DbDFXPY0_lZY_V8HkxQ

We came during happy hour and they told all of us it did not apply to us because we were too big of a party. Needless to say, I think 2 people ordered a $8 beer but they could have made much more money off us if they allowed the happy hour for the last 30 minutes there was left to encourage more drinking during the meal. Food was super overpriced for what you get. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good but I can make a pasta meal at home that's just as good for $20 for 5 people as opposed to $20-$30/plate.

The place is not very big with a 6 or 8 seat bar, a small area to wait for a table, a main dinning room with 8 booths or so and about 10 dining tables.  There is a small dance floor but it is more for the singer than for dancing.  There is a second room for large groups or overflow seating but it was not air conditioned the night we came.....and I can not imagine trying to dine in there with temps about 15 degrees higher than the restaurant.  My only real complaint is that the temp in the dining room was about 76 degrees and it felt a little stuffy and warm.

1.  Make a reservation.
2.  Ask for a booth
3.  Be willing to play along
4.  Have a martini or two
5.  The ""Sinatra"" singer is actually really good and he smelled nice too.
6.  Use your cell phone flashlight instead of the mini flash lights they give you to read the menu.

Greeter was great.

Lounge singer was very 70s and campy, but liked him none the less.


Food is pretty below average in pretty much every way possible.

Bread they bring out is pretty bad and dries out within minutes of being at the table to the point it's inedible.

Salads were small, boring and WAY drowned in dressing.

Calamari is $15 or so, and is half the size of what they'd give you at Capitol Grille, and is pretty bland and mushy.

the pasta tasted as though it were cooked in rancid water.  the chef was nice enough to come out and bring my wife a personalized dish that he eats, and it tasted the same.  we smiled and pretended to enjoy it just to keep from looking like big complainers.  We literally don't complain usually, but her first dish was inedible.

My lasagna was decent, but nothing spectacular and the sauce was too sweet (but that's a matter of taste, so i digress.)

Desert: It was spectacular.  Try the tiramisu, it is the best I've ever had.  Canolis were great too.  Loved it.

Our server was new, and he told us as such, so he was pretty clueless overall, but very nice as well.

Bus boys were very attentive.

Service overall was above average but the food was just so mediocre I can't think of a reason to talk myself into visiting again.

If you go, get a drink, maybe an app, and head somewhere else for a good italian dinner.  For God's sake, Maggianos (a chain) kills this place at the same price point.  You're better of there or Macaroni Grill truthfully.",Zg3g7sXBgF1r-CJVwGTOlA,3,0,1,AmV6reBJkv2Z7clOulGSEg

The service follows the old speakeasy feel. Reservations are recommended, otherwise try to grab a seat at the bar (which can be hard to come by). When you call to make a reservation you'll get an abrupt ""yeah, "" making it feel like you're part of a secret Italian meeting. You'll get the same ""what do you want attitude"" when you come in the front door. It's all part of the appeal to the restaurant. Once you get your table, the servers are attentive & the food arrives in a timely fashion. There is a view of the kitchen from some of the seating at the bar and booths. Further inside, you get a view of the Sinatra-like performer. There's also room room for larger parties. 

The food quality here is great. I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, but everything here is really good. Ma's meatballs is two huge meatballs served with sauce and peppers that add a nice spice. The lasagna portion is gigantic & my fave. The chicken parmigiana and chicken Marsala are tasty traditional choices, but I would recommend trying something more original like the chicken Anastasia. For dessert the turtle cheesecake hits the spot. 

The prices are $20-$30 for dinner, but the portions are huge so you'll likely have leftovers. If you get an appetizer, consider sharing an entree. They also have 2for1 Tuesdays to offset cost.

Highly suggest trying their calamari, it melts in your mouth and the sauce isn't overwhelming. I ordered there spaghetti and meatballs, which is what their known for. Their tomato sauce is truly one of a kind. Though I wasn't fond of the meatball because of the rosemary, everyone else at my table thought it was fantastic. 

We came for my step dad's birthday. I told the host earlier in the evening we have a celebrant. At the end we ordered the dessert and the live singer sung happy birthday which really topped it off.

This place is a hoot -- you have to ring a bell and then you're asked for a password to be let in (like the old Speakeasy's - very fun)
The restaurant is VERY dark, especially coming from the Vegas sun -- it's dark and very cozy with lots of half-booths. The décor is fun, photos of gangsters and Sinatra's mugshot.

There is a singer doing lounge songs, and he's pretty good!
Our waiter, Bruce, was great -- his personality fit the place perfectly. He gave us recommendations for dinner and wine.

For appetizer, we went with the bruschetta, which was very good. The bread was thin and toasty/crunchy and absorbed the yummy tomato topping, it was very light.

For dinner, hubby got the shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta -- the sauce was tasty, but the shrimp were over-cooked which was sad because the pasta was perfect.

I went with the recommendation of the chicken marsala with mushroom risotto -- it was just excellent and so delicious, a great combo together. The chicken was so tender you could cut with a fork and the marsala was thick and full of flavor. The risotto was a perfect match.

I am an Italian from Boston and I have not had a better Italian meal in the North End.

As we had ordered our apps, Hubby said ""I know that waiter, we have seen him before"" and then we realized that he had served us at the Range at Harrah's a few years back -- he had a personality that leaves a positive impression. We asked him and sure enough it was the same guy! He was thrilled that we had remembered him, he spent a few minutes telling us about what happened with the Range and how he ended up at Capo's. What a sweet guy, so genuine - he said he was so happy that we remembered him and you could tell he really meant it.

What a great experience - we will be back.

The only reason it's not 5 star is because of the over-cooked shrimp, other than that it was spot-on perfect!",uJqy8uK0js_OGkBgOi1WSg,3,1,4,-cbr-LWFUTC7LU737nwohw

We are East Coasters - (NJ) so we know a little about NY and good Italian.  The meatballs are GREAT!  The Angels with Dirty Faces - angel hair, peas, mushrooms and pepperoni is fantastic!  Husband had the lasagna and LOVED it.  Cocktails were on the money - not watered down.  Had a Banango (banana/mango) martini made by ""B"".  Was delicious!!! Service was spectacular.  Was my birthday and they all made me feel like famiglia!!  Ask for B as your server - he was so welcoming, attentive - just a great guy!!!  They surprised me with free cannoli for desert - dipped in chocolate and a custard filling - ON THE MONEY!  We will be back - love being locals!

First of all I am all about cleanliness , but I could not help but focus on my spotted , unpolished wine glass. My husband tried to get my attention off the topic , but it still was in the back of mind. 
   On the bright side with a few glasses of Riesling I was able to get over it . Upon our arrival I was surprised by the speakeasy entrance where I focused my eyes on the door I was sure was to secretly open, was actually on the opposite side. This greeting is a fun goodfellas type greeting in a secret corridor. 
For starters my hubby and I both had a salad -his with house vinaigrette and I chose the bleu cheese. He was quite pleased but mine was drenched in the bleu cheese. Blech! I don't like my salad drowning in the dressing. 
For dinner we both chose the Scarface shrimp scampi . On the plus side the shrimp was plump and generous in size. 
The linguine was flavored with a small amount of scampi seasoning , tomatoes and garlic. The flavor was good but it was as if the chef dumped the linguine out and didn't toss the seasoning all the way through. I can eat some pasta but this was like a bland pile of linguine for $25 a plate , I expected more. 
The ambiance was warm and relaxing. On Fridays they have a frank Sinatra crooner singing old blue eyes remakes. On my previous visits they would be playing old mobster movies but this time it was showing a basketball game. 
The best thing to make up for my downer of dinner was the dessert! Chocolate cannoli's were Devine,with a rich, cinnamon chocolate coating= tasty!
All in all , I still like this place . I will just order a different plate next time, I also may consider going to the Sahara location.? I love the idea and nostalgia Capo's brings so I am willing to give it another visit.  Try it for yourself , meanwhile I will forget about it !!!!!",M-E7_NatXfxNiQeFy8V4pQ,2,1,3,2jYuFT7gHIA_kq0KQcPgmQ

We arrived 1 hour before closing and we found the level of service attention was lacking.  That might be because i ordered a coke and my wife got water, but we were waiting a long time to order, get our food, and get the check.  We had to flag the waiter down because he only visited our table once after we got our food.

I would come here again just for the experience, not for the food.

This truly is a speak-easy, and most would not expect what happens when you enter the place which makes it fun.

The outside looks like it was once a Hooters, that's because it once was ha ha ha. But you can barely tell when you get inside.

It is very dark inside, very swanky. I loved it because it was romantic. I wish they had real candles on the table, but maybe that is a city ordinance or because it would make the restaurant hotter than it already was. The kitchen is open (hooters give away number 2) so I think  that is what heats up the place. 

The menu's come with cute little flashlights so you can read in the dimly lit room, which i thought was a nice touch.

I ordered a pellegrino, I was expecting the bottle to be chilled but it wasn't. I didn't complain though. 

Our waitress was a sweetheart and very attentive.  

I ordered the Clams and Linguini in a White Sauce - I believe it is called ""The gallows with clams"" - It was alright, kind of soupy with no real flavor..nothing I would write home about.

My boyfriend ordered the ""Sawed off sausage"" but took it back. Not really any sauce and the sausage was just a little too spicy and he already had heartburn. He then ordered the ""Al Capone Carbonara"" - He said it lacked flavor, but once he added a little salt to it, he enjoyed it a bit more. 

So dinner was ""Meh"" to say the least.

We ordered the ""Cannoli"" for dessert and that was fantastic! SOOOO delicious.

So like I said we would come back for the experience and the Cannoli.. but thats about it. A little too expensive for the quality of food you actually get.

Service was so slow, maybe the service staff congregating. Thanks to the busser/ service assistant for at least refilling our drinks and replenishing our bread. The kitchen that is in sight of the tables lack a sense of urgency needed to provide a speed of service to turn the tables, maybe that explains the manager/host seemingly stressed out whisking in the dining room and out again with no purpose but to see we were all hungry staring about and doing little about correcting it.

Food was enjoyable portion size smaller than that of most Italian restaurants I have visited. It stopped me from over eating and feeling stuffed, so I was okay with it.

2186130,2016-04-29,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Right off the bat, to only give Capo's one-star, this is a tough one for us because we went out of our way to make sure and have dinner here with the kids, knowing they also enjoy that old-school feel, not to mention their entertainer, Kevin DeCosta. He's very good! 

In addition, regarding our uneventful night, I should point out that I did contact a Manager. I spoke to Dominic (sp?). He was very kind and apologetic. He said that the next time we're in town, let him know. He'll make sure it will be a more enjoyable moment. That's cool and I appreciate his offer. But that doesn't erase the fact of what had happened that night. What was worse - it wasn't just one bad thing. It was three consecutive mistakes, one right after the other, and all by the same person, our server, ASHLEY. 

1. When a salad is included with your dinner order, the server will read off the choices. Easy, right? Most of us know this drill, simple. Done. Not exactly. Ashley read off the choices of salads that come with our dinner, including Caesar Salad. We ordered Caesar. 

2. Cocktails. We ordered two Vodka Collins. Easy to make. A regular drink for us. Unless specified, unless we ""call"" the type of Vodka, the establishment will give you House Vodka. 

3. The bill.  Just over $160.00. We pay with cash,  2-one hundred dollar bills. Easy math. 200 minus 160, forty dollars change. Give or take the loose change. But still, simple math, nothing hard. 

But here's the thing... Although she reads off the salads as if they were our choices that come with the dinners, the Caesar salads were actually an extra charge. Not once did she say something along the lines of ""Caesar is extra, is that okay?""  If she had mentioned this, I promise you we would have said ""yes, that's good."" Instead, she decided to keep this bit of info from us. 

Our Vodka drinks. Although we did our usual ordering of ""Vodka Collins"", and not a ""Call drink"", she went ahead and used Kettle One Vodka, not a house Vodka. In other words, yes, there was an extra charge for that, too.

Our bill. Knowing we should receive approximately forty dollars back, Ashley returned with the change. She left. We opened it, double checked everything, and btw, this is when we also saw the above problems. But to top it off... she didn't short change us fifty cents, not even one dollar. We were short ten dollars! 

To have these three things happen all on the same night by the same server, and they all have to do with money... I mean, it has to really make you think. In our eyes, this was not a mistake anymore. She clearly deceived us. Definitely not a good thing. You can accidentally give us ranch dressing over blue cheese. Marinara sauce over Meat sauce. But to not state that there's an extra charge for a Caesar; to assume we wanted Kettle One; and to take an additional ten dollars from OUR money?!!!!  However way you want to look at it, it comes down to this, especially since we were the ones to have the unfortunate experience... Ashley was either told by the company to do this. Or she took it upon herself to take us for our money. Big mistake. 

I'll say this again - I did reach out to their Manager. Dominic did offer make things right. I don't know what that entails, but he seemed kind and professional. The experience was the worse we have ever had ANYWHERE. However, my kids like that old-school feel. So if we happen to take a trip to Vegas soon, maybe... just maybe we'll give it another shot. But after what happened, that's really a tough one. And if we do and all is 100% better, I'll revise this review, but until then, that was a terrible way to lose customers. Very deceiving. The thought is more like this, ""After what had happened, can we trust them?""

To recommend this place would be wrong on my part to the reader. It's clearly spelled out for you, so this is an easy one. If you're looking for that special dinner to go to tonight or the weekend, regardless if you're a local or  visitor, I have to say it might be wise to do the extra homework and browse the many restaurants in Las Vegas and the surrounding areas. Like I said, we're not talking accidentally being served ranch over blue cheese... this is money. Money taken from us. Because of this, Capo's has lost our respect and trust. 

And so now as you're deciding, you have to remember: It's your money and it's always your choice.",V_vc008-2umfV4m80LWzPQ,3,0,1,FAdtn8EQ3zyGYAjhoQrw7A

There is a little surprise waiting for you when you knock on the door, but I won't ruin any surprises...

The restaurant is dark with red leather big booths, with dark red velvet walls. They had a Sinatra styled singer performing, and we even had a magician stop by our tables and BLOW OUR MINDS!!  Seriously, one of the trippiest and straight-up scary performances I've ever seen. This dude was the son of satan.

Now on to the food... We started with a few appetizers. Ma's Meatballs, Calamari, and Bust a Cap Mushroom Caps. All were great, but the very spicy meatballs were my favorite. The warm breadsticks served with garlic butter were bomb as well. I ordered the Chicken Parm with Spaghetti con Suga and a creamy garlic salad. The salad was so tasty! The spaghetti fantastic! And the chicken parm so on point, it was perfection! The salad was one of my favorite salads I've ever had, and the chicken parm was possibly my favorite ever.

Now, onto the dessert... The chocolate covered cannoli was the best cannoli I've ever had. This place was a clean sweep! Awesome ambiance, cool theme and schtick, good entertainment, and fantastic food.

First impression, I didn't know what to expect. I'll leave it at that, because it's honestly better to experience it first hand. Inside the decor was nice, dim lit but romantic. 

The ambience was like old-school Vegas, like what you would see in those old gangsta mob movies. I really enjoyed it. There was a guy who sang old school Vegas songs. I was in love, with the ambience, food, and my partner. It was pure magic. I would like to come here again. Hint, hint to my boyfriend. lol ;)",dWS7ISk4GIn8Pv_FuHirFw,4,3,5,F5BM8-NyjhNNOg6gnPsZzw

I won't spoil it, but its pretty cool and a nice touch to enter the place.  Once you enter, it is dimly lit and feels almost like a mob bar.  The host was wearing a nice Italian looking suit and the ambiance and decor of the restaurant screams Little Italy, even though it has a tattoo parlor and a check cashing place right next door.

Once we were seated, the waitress came over and offered us drinks and told us about the specials which were described excellently.  She left and a moment later an assistant had bread and our drinks.  We ordered a few moments later and the service never stopped being superb.

The food came out and it was excellent.  I had the ribeye with blue cheese crumb crust and spaghetti on the side with a caesar salad.  Very delicious.  We stayed in the restaurant for 2 hours but never felt rushed or pressured to leave.  The live music that was playing in the background I didn't even realize it was live until I caught a glimpse of the singer.

There are pictures on the walls of various notorious pre-WWII gangsters.  There was a gentleman performing karaoke to classic Sinatra, Martin, Bennett and other crooners.  He was, for the most part, right on.  

Eventually, we made our way to a booth to eat.  In our group we ordered Veal, salmon, lasagna and arrabiata pasta.  We started with an appetizer of caprese which was very good.  A large section of mozzarella, thick slice of tomato and a good dose of balsamic vinegar.  I would have preferred more basil, but I'm really partial to basil.  Our meals were delicious.  The protions were good, but not overwhelming.  With our appetizer, bread, and soup or salad before the meal there was enough to take home after eating sensibly.

I chose the Scarface Shrimp Scampi. Let me tell you..........it was freakin' delicious! HOWEVER........it was lacking in shrimp. And for a plate that costs almost $27, I really expected a main dish to have more than just 4 little shrimps!! When I mentioned it to the waiter, he just laughed and brushed my comment off. Gave no explanation and made no effort to make things right. If the owner ever reads this, I'd love to know if only 4 shrimp is common practice!? But, it was still yummy!

I was there with a group of 9. We had all used different modes of transportation to get to the restaurant from our hotel. Upon leaving, the restaurant arranged for a party bus to pick us up and take us to our next destination!

As you exit the restaurant, you'll find evidence left behind on the floor. The outline of a body! Quite comical!

I'd eat there again, but if I ordered the same thing, I would definitely ask about the quantity of shrimp I can expect!!",_DpPh-pN2nscXdwRnNDc1g,0,0,4,00vzirhnEmwiZWpDt2nYww

I ordered the Santucci's Pasta, spaghetti noodles in homemade pasta sauce and homemade meatball which was massive and very tasty even the sauce was really good compared to the store bought stuff. My date ordered the lasagna which was a HUGE chunk in a bowl and she enjoyed it immensely but needed a to-go box to take 3/4 of it home.

2481207,2012-10-11,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I think Capo's deserves a 2.5 because of originality, but since the stars won't allow, and due to a big-time let down and poor quality, I'll round down.

My Dad was in town for his 60th Birthday and he wanted Italian food for a less than outrageous price.  We can be pretty picky with Italian food considering we are Italian, and the fact that we come from where Italian food is actually good (NY,Philly,NJ).  He suggested Maggiano's because we know to expect good quality.  I didn't want to take him to a chain though, I wanted him to have something he could only get in Vegas, so I did my homework on Yelp, and Capo's seemed like the right choice.  A choice I ended up regretting.

No horror stories here, but as you will read, the service and food quality just weren't there, the only thing good was the atmosphere.

Upon arrival the entry and speakeasy theme was pretty cool.  Would have been cooler without a sign that said credit cards were currently not accepted, cash only.  But still pretty cool.
Inside, the very dark environment with mafia decor and old Italian Resaurante style kept me looking around.  And an the old Vegas style lounge singer was belting out the Sinatra hits in a voice slightly better than my own (this is not a compliment to my voice).

From here it just goes down hill.

There was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open, not being used.  I didn't realize we'd need a reso being it was a Tues night during the off-season and the place being in a hole in the wall off the beaten path.  Perhaps this was still my fault.

The service was bad.  Friendly enough, sure.  But we didn't get the water we asked for, and even after ordering we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.  Then the bread came, and had I not been starving, I would have tossed it in the garbage.  This was possibly the worst bread I have ever tasted.  Is it possible for bread to be that bad?  Apparently it is.  Not just bad, but terribly stale.  I gobbled up the chewy, stale loaf anyway because I was so hungry from waiting, nearly ripping out teeth in the process.

The main course eventually came and it was all sub-par.  Edible, yes.  In an Olive Garden quality kind of way, maybe a bit worse.  The fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the TV dinner box.  The added shrimp were a nice size.

My Dad got ravioli's in a red sauce with meatballs.  Again, just edible.  Especially since we were starving.  But a very generic taste all around.  I honestly felt embarrassed that I brought my Pop to eat this.

This is not a true Italian place.  It is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.  If you have ever had real Italian food, the taste of this food will be a total let down.",n-U4c31vGjJ4SE91Qa93Vw,8,0,2,VVJquCOackJKZwtsA-cEMg

Only 5 ravioli for $18.95. Wasn't good enough to warrant that price and the extra $5 for a average meatball. I don't know why it's ""famous"" because it tasted like bread crumbs to me. Food sat under the heating lamp for 20 minutes before someone finally delivered it. We were there far longer than we needed to be waiting for service and missed a planned event because of it. (No, they weren't that busy) Trying to get in was fun but we were not put in the room showing on the website. It was a side room that wasn't very nice. And if its so authentic why don't they have authentic SWEET Italian sausage. Why is that so hard to find in the west?

We started out with some great apps.  The fried ravioli, meatballs and the ""off the menu"" leftovers dish that our waitress (Janine) cut into 8 portions since it is normally served as a healthy sized entrée.  It was fantastic.  The fried ravioli was pretty good, but would have preferred a meat filling vs. ricotta cheese.  The meatballs were as good as they get.  Everyone commented for days about how good they were.
My wife kept it light and just got a chicken Caesar salad and loved it.  I had the veal parmesan and loved it.  Everyone was so impressed with each of their entrees, we were sharing bites from across the table for an hour.
Our entire group is from Chicago and an Al Capone Speakeasy was of interest to all of us.  We know our Italian food and I've been traveling to Vegas for nearly 40 years and had some of the best Italian food in the world while visiting there.

We started off with the meatballs and fried ravioli, and I can honestly say I would eat that all day long.  I didn't need anything else.  Then out came the salad with the garlic dressing and I was in heaven. 

The steak and lobster meal was great but in most cases you cant really F that up, most of the time.  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, garlic mash, and the risotto.  I will say the highlight of the meal was the side of risotto.  I was absolutely stuffed by the time I got to the side of risotto and I couldn't stop once I had a taste of it.  

The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I had to ask for water 5 times.  Not 5 different occasions, but 5 times until my glass was actually filled.  It may seem petty but with as many amazing flavors as Capo's has going on water was needed throughout the whole meal.  Also with the preset there was a glass of wine or champagne that was never brought to our table.

Loved the complimentary bread. 

Got shrimp scampi for appetizer and it was the best! The sauce was buttery and garlicky. I could eat this everyday!

Pasta comes with salad or soup. Duck soup was great. 

The chef sleeps with fish pasta: disappointing. Pasta was overcooked and bland. I added a lot of salt and still couldn't save it. Ended up only eating the shrimps. 

Meatball: enjoyed the sauce. Meatballs decent. 

Veal parm with pasta: bf loved it. I liked the pasta more than veal cuz the sauce was sooooo delicious!

Place is super dark, they have tiny flashlights on the menu. The bread they give you is hard with no flavor.

Ordered Caesar salad (Taste like raw garlic and butter or oil didn't like it) and Italian dressing salad (salad seems old not bright green or crisp to it).  

Ordered the clam paste with white wine. The clams was soo over cooked it seem like I was chewing gum there. The paste was cover cooked. The sauce has a tiny bit of spicy which I didn't like. I didn't even finish 1/2 my plate. Took it to go. Hoping someone would eat it at home. nope ending up in the trash. Waste of $23.95  

Also ordered the Sausage Spaghetti plus extra $5.00 for a huge meatball. The paste was over cooked again, the meatball was soft, the sauce didn't taste good had a sweet but nasty bitter flavor, and the sausage was just ok nothing special. Chef Boyardee Ravioli is soo much better. Could have bought a few dozen cans.

I wouldn't have minded paying the fee but there was no air conditioning and it was a little side room that was hot and stuffy and there was no view to enjoy the entertainment,  not what one expects to pay additional for. Our bill was over 400.00 and an additional tip of 85 was placed on the bill for a party of 10 adults and 4 children.

I felt ripped of with the quailty and quanity of the food vs. The price. I thank them for at least taking the room fee off as it is not worth it and they had told me that they would waive the fee in the first place anyways.

I wore a flapper dress with homemade feather headdress, fiancé wore pinstripe suit with fedora, my sister-in-law wore pinstripe suit with fedora. We were dressed to a T and ready for a gangster dinner before the big fake night.

We walked up and the building had that aura of gangster, complete with pictures of famous gangsters. The door was set up like a speak easy. You stand there and someone slides open a peep hole and asked you what you want. Then the whole wall moves, they had a pay phone on the moving wall. We were not expecting that at all!

They had a cheesy magician who's fake thumb fell off onto our table... wah wah, lame.

The singer was amazing!!! Frank Sinatra all night! We were ordering a lot of drinks, a few varieties, and they were all great. Props to the bartender!!!

""Frank"" kept hitting on me knowing we were on our way to get ""married"". He got a great tip. ;)

Now onto the food. Oh my!!!!! Cheese bread appetizer. We all ordered different entrees. Fiancé: steak and spaghetti, sissy: chicken in white wine sauce and spaghetti, me: ravioli in Alfredo sauce. OHHHH to die for!!! The food was amazing!!!! And I'm a picky eater. Very particular. But all of it was so scrumptious. We were all three trying each other's and fawning over the food.

Three foodies who were super impressed!!! I can't rave more about this place. The price is high, don't expect a $20 meal.

The food is good but I have had better. We both ordered chicken parmigiana, and it was exactly what you want when looking for chicken parmigiana but priced higher. You can select your side dish from a few pre-set choices - I went safe for the spagetti on the side which was yummy, my boyfriend ordered mashed potatoes on the side (which, of course, I sampled - those were also good).

First off, the entrance is not obvious, you have to be buzzed in after answering a question or maybe even two. The lighting is a bit dark but it adds to the theme which of course is all about the mob. Capone is everywhere on the walls as well as many of his counterparts from then and even more recent. 

The food was amazing. We had the stuffed mushrooms and bread as our appetizer. That was something I would go back for alone. Both my wife and I had pasta dishes which were fantastic. My penne pasta with vodka sauce and a meatball was incredible and my wife's cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce and pepperoni was just as good.

This is a speakeasy style restaurant, so trying to find the entrance as a first timer was a little tricky. Once we found the right door, we rang the bell and a guy slides a little panel and asked if we have reservations. In other words, he wanted to know ""Who sent us!"" Hahaha. 

When you enter the actual restaurant, it's a the atmosphere dark, there is a bar with a piano across from it and then dining tables and booths. We were seated, then are server came out, he was very personable and attentive. When you open your menu, there is a little flashlight strung on top of it, this helps you see what you're ordering because of the dim lighting. 

Apparently, they are famous for their meatballs, but I decided to save that for next visit since I was sure we would come back just from first impression. We got a bottle of  Mascanto. The boyfriend ordered the Veal. I ordered the Eggplant parm, which comes with your choice of salad I got the garden and for your side your choice of mashed potatoes or pasta, I got the pasta.

Everything was amazing, I love the way the make their food. I have to say as someone who grew up eating Italian food their whole life I was impressed. This restaurant will be my go-to place for good Italian cuisine.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,4,2,5,4I-FByj_hGlBsDMMIaJ49g

They are fully committed to the speakeasy theme, which is cheesy, but fun; a sultry lounge singer, ultra dim lights, & menu items dedicated to mobs and gangsters convey an air of danger & mystique even though your surroundings are totally safe (it's a family-friendly or Girls' Night Out kinda place, to be honest.) 

Capo's isn't just all about the theatrics, the food is actually really good...I'm not sure he would agree in regards to his veal Parmesan, but I enjoyed our ""temptations"" (appetizer) called ""Dino's Deep Fried Ravioli"" with tangy pink sauce. My ""Man-Made Pasta, spaghetti & meatballs named ""Santucci's Pasta,"" was indeed well-made (see what I did there?)

It had the feel of an old mob speakeasy from start to finish. Going on, you have to knock on an outside door and someone pops their head out of a side panel to see who you are. After confirming the reservation, you are let into a dimly let restaurant where the decor is clean, cool, and old school (with pictures of mobsters hanging up). The music was calm and easy, and by midway through the meal we had a live singer going around the tables. He was awesome. 

As for the food: absolutely amazing. I'm a vegetarian and was very happy with the selection. We started with the fried ricotta rivoli and had the soup (pasta fagioli, much like minestrone) or salad that came with our entrees. I then got the rigatoni trafficante (minus the prosciutto) and my friend got the shrimp alfredo. Everything was so delicious and clearly homemade. We would have gotten dessert but we were super stuffed. 

Over all, it's a bit out of the way (relative to the Strip) but definitely worth it, both for the experience and for the food. I highly recommend Capo's!",iWNFESa9Fgw_ZiTzjsJV4A,0,0,5,uYhqRBJYGtBGxtsfO__Nsg

The prices were semi-high, which we normally would not mind, but with that, we expect it to be of that quality. One dish of fettuccine was good. One dish of penne was over cooked and the vodka sauce a bit bland.  It happens and is understandable to an extent on a busier Friday night, but still...

The other odd part of the night was being told that they did not have any open tables because they were busy, so we accepted bar seating...but the entire time we were there, we counted four empty and set tables in the main dining area. We thought perhaps they were reserved, but they were never filled.

My thought is it's a good idea to have a reservation, go with a group to enjoy the music, atmosphere and service, but don't have high expectations of the food. I've experienced Capo's now, but moving on to the next place.",LiwugQEw5hKWfv89SwCRcQ,0,0,3,4olTx6iVJg2nBjh7_shG3Q

Our food was wonderful tasting, service was great and the place was packed! (we had 6/30 reservations and by 7 you could barely move, remember, this was a Tuesday night).

Prices were reasonable, not cheap but you got a lot of food for the dollar.  The mushroom appetizer was wonderful as well.  Lots to choose from.  There was a male ""Sinatra"" like singer which just added to the mood of the place.  It's very dark in there though.

Even with the $28. Uber ride from Treasure Island, it still was a reasonable night. (Think $100. for 2, 1 drink each, appetizer, entree.)   Loved the place and would go back again if ever back in Vegas.",R-B-chotpniEYlwQu_7V4w,0,0,5,Y5EYXCwZo3fH7LRUaFuZww

The restaurant is pretty dark when you walk in, and it will take a little bit for your eyes to adjust. Definitely, a cool speakeasy vibe with pictures of gangsters on the walls. All of the employees were very nice and checked in on our group from time to time. I started with the Garlic Cheese Bread and had Da Don's Lasagna for dinner. I was expecting/hoping the garlic cheese bread would be crispy and toasted, but instead, it was very soft, almost soggy. The sauce that it comes with was ok, and was much needed to add flavor to the bread, which didn't have much flavor by itself. My lasagna was large, but tough and rubbery. It seemed like the cheese within the layers was not heated enough, so it wasn't melted. Whenever I would try to bring my fork to my mouth, the lasagna would take my food back to the plate. The only way I can describe the sauce is that it was a little harsh tasting, or acidic for my taste. I only ate a quarter of it, before I gave up. 

I really wanted to like Capo's, and was looking forward to my dinner. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their food, so maybe I'll come back and order something different and see if that helps. I'll make sure to update my review whenever that happens. I feel they deserve a second chance. Like I said, the atmosphere is cool, and the employees were very nice. The magician that visits the tables was great! His tricks were comparable to the magicians at The Magic Castle in Hollywood.

 As dinner continued the food was not cheaply priced and not outstanding.

 Lower or equal to olive garden. 

As the night progressed, I tried to enjoy the night but the lounge singe decided to play music very loud destroying any romantic evening, and when we were done the lounge singer ran out to talk to my date again.

If this is a place your bringing a girl for the first time you should get there first or the employees will pick up your date.

Very unprofessional, expensive and not relaxing. 

The only good thing about the place is it has a nice atmosphere.. Sometimes Yes I have been there 5+ times and never had really good food, and was amazed when my date went home with the lounge singer.    

So if you want to overpay for low quality food and have the employees hitting on your date, This place is Perfect!!!

Some mixed reviews but honestly I am always up to try new things and I M sure glad I did!! First.. Read the previous reviews.  You will have a better understanding of what to expect.  Yes it is off the strip and takes about 20 mins to get there.  Google directions ppl if driving too far is a problem.  Next, the entrance is unconventional.  It is somewhat hidden and that is part of the ""theme"".  Keep in mind, everything this place does seems intentional to me.  From the stuffy host, the gimmick about being too full, all of it.  Part of why I loved it so much.  We made reservations for a Saturday night and all that was available was 9pm. My husband and I decided on a whim to go early and see if we could get in.  We got a little push back but they gave us a great seat and the rest was wonderful.  Again I wasn't offended... All part of the act.  Food was great but the meatballs were AMAZING!

From the time you knock on the door to enter the restaurant, you feel like you have been transported back to someone's dream of old Vegas, complete with dark lighting and a Frank Sinatra-style crooner.  The food is much better than it needs to be for a theme restaurant like this one.  (I would give the food 3.5 stars by itself.) Everyone enjoyed their meal, and the enormous meatballs were a big hit.  

The singer engaged the audience in his performance and even invited a couple members of our party to sing along with one of the songs.

The decor is old school, but not in a good way. Instead of looking like a place that was inspired by decades past, it just looks like the decor hasn't been updated in decades. 

The food is nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I started with the ""bust a cap"" stuffed mushrooms, and was not impressed. I was expecting to have my mind blown, but was instantly disappointed instead. Bland and flavorless from the first bite. For my main course, I had a ""chef sleeps with the fishes"". This was better without a doubt, but still only slightly above average. 

I felt gypped. I honestly could have had better ""Italian"" food at an Olive Garden for less than half the price. Or, alternatively, I could have gotten far superior Italian food on the Strip for a similar price point. 

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that they charge $8 to split a dish. No extra soup, no extra salad and the exact same serving size for a single person. Just an $8 up charge to split something. That was super disappointing, because my boyfriend and I almost always split an appetizer and a main course wherever we go. Restaurant portions are huge, we don't ever end up eating leftovers and it's cheaper, so it just makes sense. So to be charged an additional $8 and receive nothing extra return is kinda ridiculous.

If you are into MOB movies and gangster flicks like we are, what better way to experience firsthand at something similar (well kind of) to how the Vegas MOB lived, where they dined and how they had a good time. This is not the fanciest restaurant but it's totally old school. The red leather booths, the stage for performance, the piano guy and all the attitude that comes with the people. That's their thing.

We sat down and the amazing service immediately started. Since the restaurant was very dark inside (image), they had these little cute lights hanging from their menus.

I did make reservations, and I do believe they are highly recommended, if not required. You go in through a side entrance and ring the doorbell. All the sudden a peep hole on the other side of the room opens and in true ""speakeasy"" fashion you are asked why you're here and I played along with the passcode from the website.  Then you're lead in through a door behind a payphone.

Very dark inside so it does take a bit to adjust, but the menus come with flashlights if you need it.  The drinks we ordered were very good although I forget the names. We decided to forgo appetizers since we weren't starving. You do get bread and I had the soup with my meal.  The pasta and food was very high quality Italian. Sometimes you go to ""theme restaurants' and they skimp on the food, but that was NOT the case here.

I loved the vibe, they had a singer doing Sinatra and a magician wandering around performing for the tables. It was amazing to see magic that close to you.

The server took a long time to even take our order, refused to split checks or even allow us to use multiple credit cards, had other people deliver our food, never refilled our drinks and was anxious to get us out of there.  The place was only about half full and this girl claimed to have worked there for a while but obviously was not interested in doing a good job.  For the money, I'd go someplace that actually wanted our business.",oBzWjC1-sx-I5aazkWy2dQ,1,0,2,fWi4ANH1GSv5g8ufvdo7gA
2909964,2015-04-11,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Full disclosure: I've been wanting to eat here for at least a year. Capo's owner, Nico Santucci, randomly followed me on Twitter so I took a look into what he was all about when I discovered Capo's. A mob themed Italian restaurant with a speakeasy style entrance? Sold! After finally getting to dine here,  I can say it exceeded everyone of my expectations. I had a reso for 5:30 (highly recommended BTW) and got in using the password (found on their website). It was cool to play along with the door man (apparently I had Auntie G's money) but when we got in he was so nice. It is very dark in there so watch your step. Our table was near the bar but you can see the kitchen so it was a bit brighter than if you sat near the back. Our server, Brandon, was very good, very attentive. One of the ways I judge a restaurant's service is how often my water glass gets filled. Never got below halfway so zero complaints. The food? Unbelievable. I had the Chicken Anastasia with a side of spaghetti. My companion had the lasagna. The Anastasia was perfect. The pink sauce was rich and the chicken was tender. My companion said the lasagna was the best she's ever had by a wide margin. They absolutely do not skimp on the ingredients. I had a bite of the lasagna and it was an explosion of cheese.  The Capone's Secret Sauce was a wise investment by Mr. Santucci. It is absolutely delicious (just ask Adam Richman) There is live entertainment here with a gentleman singing Sinatra tunes. So between the dark vibe and the singing it makes for a great atmosphere. However, be sure to ask to sit closer to the back of the restaurant where it's quieter as the bartenders chatter can take you out of your zone. My companion can be picky so I was afraid she wouldn't care for it but nope. She loved it. Capo's is a place we will be visiting every time I'm in Vegas. Buon Appetito!",GL-vCeVAYEEV9WZPUibUtw,0,0,5,S9qy2xw6o1VvHmdlyL-leA
2910322,2016-08-29,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"The ambiance in this place can't be beat if you're looking for a classic Vegas speakeasy-type of old-world Italian charm. The food - as long as you stick to what they do best - is pretty darn good too, making this place worth the trip up Sahara.  The service was really spot-on too.  We had early 5:00pm reservations on a Saturday night for six people and there were plenty of attentive staff members to attend to our every need.

There were unfortunately a few shortfalls.  One was with the Chilean Sea Bass which was a special of the evening.  Ordering seafood at an Italian restaurant with no fish at all on the menu probably isn't a good idea, and this proved to be the case here.  Luckily I wasn't the one who ordered it and the person in our group who did wasn't as familiar with the plate.  She didn't seem to mind the fishy smell and taste which ordinarily wouldn't accompany a fresh version of this dish, but the bite I had was not good.  Wasn't prepared poorly, just wasn't fresh or of high quality, particularly for the price.  Minus one star.

The rest of the food, though also somewhat pricy, was delicious.  Pasta, a signature chicken dish and even a Ribeye steak were all wonderful.  The meatball appetizer consisting of two baseball-sized meatballs in a spicy pepper sauce was a real star of the show.  Stuffed mushrooms were good too, but also a bit on the spicy side.  If you're not a lover of zing, watch for things on the menu noted as spicy - they're not lying.

For larger parties of six or more, they are supposed to include an 18% gratuity as explained on the menu.  Parties of either 8 or 10 or more (can't recall which) have a 20% gratuity tacked on.  I don't have a problem with this and it's clearly noted on the back of the menu, but it seems the staff does have a problem with it.  When our check came there was a 20% gratuity added onto it, even though we only had 6 people at the table.  To add insult to injury, they figured the 20% gratuity on the POST-TAX amount.  Those two screw-jobs added up to quite a bit since the pre-tax total was already over $300.00, so minus another star.

We were in a rush and truthfully I would have added more onto the pre-tax 18% I was expecting anyway because the service was truly fantastic, but I would have rather done so myself.  Instead, our nice meal ended with me feeling as if I'd just been screwed because they can't follow their own rules.  C'mon Capo's - do the right thing.  Figure the percentages properly and apply them appropriately to the pre-tax amount.  The extra couple of dollars isn't worth the bad taste left in the mouth of any diner paying for a party of six or more who can do basic math.  

And if you're reading this and going there with a party of six or more, keep the calculator handy and make sure you're treated fairly.  Maybe it was just our server using these kinds of underhanded, deceitful methods of figuring out gratuities, but I'll never know because next time I have six or more in our party, I'll go somewhere else.",6mQkpckXXYRIAid116M56w,2,1,3,GuJ010NS60avByA7X6V67g

The food, is better than average and you get a lot of it! The meatball appetizer is terrific, and everyone was happy with their meals. Desert was also top notch with the cannoli. Here's the one rub, and it's annoying. Because we had 8 of us, the 18% tip is included. That's fair, but I have to say that our waitress was below par. Inattentive, and lacking instincts to determine some basic needs that we had were annoying, but literally having to have other servers find her for us was aggravating. She seemed to lack training and her work ethic was marginal.

We were not aware it was reservations only, however the greeter asked if we would like to sit at the bar and sat us right away. The bar was VERY roomy with great big chairs and an awesome view of the kitchen! I actually would prefer to sit there in the future. 

The atmosphere was great! Very dim romantic lighting and live music (which wasn't too loud) very Frank Sanatra like, very good ambiance and a nice swanky feel. They have the leather tufted booths with candle light. The menu wasn't too overwhelming and offered your basic Italian favorites. The salad was very good and of course the bread was on point as I am always a sucker for good bread.  My boyfriend and I split the fettuccine pesto with chicken and broccoli and it was SOOO stinking good!

When we entered, it was dark and the front door was locked so we rang the buzzer.

There was a gentleman singing Sinatra and Martin songs. The good was great. We ordered Caesar Salad, carbonara, and their meatballs which were the best we've had.

2991747,2013-11-27,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"About 6 months back at a concierge event for work, I won a $50 gift card to Capo's. I had dined here once previously so I was pretty stoked to have a chance to go again. Also I enjoy when local places are willing to donate meals to other local establishments or events. 
The first time I came here, the secret door threw me way off. I won't say too much and ruin in. I will say enjoy it, and play along. This time, I had my 16 year old step son and he was confused and thought we took him to a closed gangster establishment. His reaction was worth it alone. 
The lighting is dim, and your menus come with small lights for those who may not be able to see the menu in the dark. (ie: me) There is live entertainment, and a cheesy mob boss who is kind of hanging out and running things. Although he is very involved and I don't believe he sees himself as cheesy one bit. The godfather is playing in the background. (Last time it was Casino) There is even a man selling roses. They go all out with the old school speakeasy type of vibe. 
The service was mediocre, don't get me wrong our waitress was pleasant. But slow, and un-attentive. Our drinks went empty and the bread basket was out, often. 
The food however made up for it. Meatballs and peppers appetizer is a must. The meatballs are a good quality meat that melt in your mouth the way they should. Just the right amount of spice lingers on your tongue leaving you hungrier than when you arrived. The pasta in all the dishes seemed like they were made in house. The bread and cheeses were fresh and authentic, and the salad came with a great house dressing. I didn't like the cheesecake, but unless its straight from NY or Cheesecake Factory, I usually don't.

This is my first time to sit down and write a review about anything but after tonight I can't keep quiet. 
I've been going to Capos for years to starting with there first location on Tropicana. I must say the food is always great. I've celebrated birthdays, anniversary's, New Years eve and just for the hell of it lets go to Capos. But, tonight was the worst experience I had. 
First we get greeted by the rudest man at the door he has no smile, no warmth, you can tell he was flustered. We're sitting with another couple waiting for a table. He calls both of us up and seats us in this ""private room"" next to each other. With no menus. And the room had to be hitting 85 degrees and humidity 120. After sitting for about 5 some one dropped off menus. The place is so dark you need a little flash light to read the menu MINE DIDNT work. I had to ask about the Chefs Specials for the night. 
I get up and ask what i think is a host slash manager slash mater'd to either A. turn the air down in that room or B. Move us to the main dinning room where you can tell it's much cooler by like 10 degrees. He intel responds in his rude italian over worked voice ""thats gonna be 20 minutes or so"". I go back to my table start fanning my self and just waiting for an open table. He comes up to our table and says ""you can eat at the  bar if you want"". I told him i didn't make a reservation to sit at the ""bar"". He responds with ""what do you want me to do then""? With his face in my face and body language like he wanted to pounce on me. I just tell him ""TO FIX THE PROBLEM"" either fix the air or move me. He storms off. 
By this time one or our appetizers hits our table. So we start eating the waitress comes up to us with our second appetizer and says your other table is ready. Im like great picked up my glass and bottled water and followed her leaving our first appetizer at the original table. We get sat in a booth in the main dinning room. First relief because its much cooler. Then we realize the table had not been wiped from the  previous guest ( which by this point that did not bug me at all). The buss boy sees that and wiped the table for us and apologizes. 
Well wed like to eat our salads that were dropped off with our second appetizer but we have no utensils. We tell our server that our calamari is on the table still she respond ""i thought you where done with that""? I had about 4 bites. So she goes back im thinking shes retrieving our appetizer or re firing a new one. Finally we get our silver ware by the bus boy and no bread. 
We ask her wheres our calamari she says "" you ate most of it"" so by this point now shes being rude and defensive. So i tell her "" am i S.O.L on my calamari? She responds with well i can have them make a half batch because you ate half. I looked at her and i almost wanted to just over turn my table in that restaurant. 
Im like i want my check im OUT OF HERE...... She gets her manager slash host slash mater'd. And hes like why are they leaving ? i did everything they wanted. He tells her to fire a calamari. By this point its to late I let him have it. Im so disgusted by the customer service theres no way to fix the situation. I told him ive been in the hospitality industry for 12 years and thats not the way you handle a situation. His last words to me where ""Wheres your restaurant ill go eat there"".....

I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN SUCH DISGUSTING, VILE, HOSTILE PLACE IN MY LIFE. I dont have a restaurant THANK GOD! But let me tell you this i never made a customer that mad that he stormed out of the restaurant i was managing. Im posting this on YELP, and on my Facebook that has over 500 friends, family, and clients. 

And let me tell you this i see my clients daily and we do is talk about Las Vegas food, shows, restaurants, As god as my witness i will bad mouth you and tell everyone i ever meet about this experience. When i have friends come to Vegas this is one Restaurant that i will not be taking them to. 

So keep up the great work and the great customer service. Maybe thats why your first original location closed, and thats why you have 2 for 1 on Tuesdays and you are on groupon every other day. Bigger better restaurants have closed there doors you can too..............


With out us THE CUSTOMERS REMEMBER YOU ARE NOTHING !!!!!!!!

I HOPE YOU THE WORST I HOPE YOU CLOSE AND I HOPE YOU NEVER GET ANOTHER JOB IN LAS VEGAS.........

Unfortunately I didn't think of reserving it until about 4 days before Valentines. The only time they had left was 9:45 PM. I reserved it anyway.

I was a little concerned they'd be rushing us to finish our meal, so we arrived about 40 minutes early. I figured we could have a couple of drinks at the bar if they weren't able to seat us. Fortunately they were able to seat us right away.

Our waitress, Mettia, was awesome! Attentive and professional and friendly.

The ambiance was great.

The food was mediocre and we waited over an hour from when we placed our order for the food to arrive.

3167812,2012-08-28,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Had dinner here last night for my fathers birthday and to put it lightly...we weren't happy. The back of their menu even says to state any complaint before you leave and asks you not to be a ""Jimmy The Weasel"". Red flag much?

For starters the food was nothing spectacular and extremely overpriced. I had the ""Sawed Off"" sausage and peppers which was $22! C'mon now. The dish was nearly all pasta and peppers with very little sausage. My dad had the extremely small portioned ""Gotti"" chicken. My wife had the fettuccine alfredo and actually left the restaurant saying she was still hungry. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay...not spectacular, but okay.

Now I'm not one to complain about a restaurant especially when the food is okay. My family and I enjoy trying new places and you're not always going to have a great experience. However, Capo's had me ready to refuse paying the bill. We used a $25 for $50 Groupon last night and Capo's works the system to where the Groupon is useless. We had 4 adults and my 4 year old son (who shared a plate). With the Groupon applied our bill was $77.77 ($127.77 without). However, the waitress took it upon herself to add $25.55 for gratuity putting the bill back up to $103.32. With the price of my Groupon, the bill was actually $0.55 higher than it would have been without a tip and to be honest, the service we received didn't deserve anywhere near a $25 tip. Once they took the credit card, the waitress even went as far as writing the tip amount on the credit card slip herself!!! Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's illegal...

Now I realize many Groupon's have fine print stating there will be an added gratuity or something but not in Capo's Groupon. Be warned, this place has other reviews about the business scamming customers and now I see why. They make the Groupon useless by adding their own tip at their chosen amount. I will never return to this place and will contact Groupon in attempt to have these theives removed from their site.

We walk into a small foyer with locked doors and a doorbell for entrance, this is at 6 PM on Wednesday. A small wizard of oz ""face door"" opens with a guy asking is we have reservations, we tell him no, he offers us to come in if we agree to sit at the bar, we were ok with that. I'm thinking ""are they going for an Italian Mafia impression? Cuz, it's working!!"" We sit at a nice big bar, in a place that was at least 90% empty --- REALLY? And a reservation is necessary for a table or booth? 

Bartender takes our drink orders and delivers the menus. The place is so dark, the menus have a keychain flashlight attached to them. The Caesar salad was limp, greasy and pretty flavorless. The pasta e figioli soup had a nice flavor, but the purée texture was kinda weird, I prefer a broth and chunky texture. 

My friend ordered the ""sleeps with fish"" specialty pasta dish, and she said it was VERY good. I ordered the vodka specialty pasta with blackened chicken, the pasta ""pink"" sauce was really flavorful and I really enjoyed the sun-dried tomatoes. The blackened chicken was extremely salty. The bread served with the meal was really good.

The bartender/waitress asked us to give her our honest impression of the things we had, so we told her.... Before long, the manager came over and apologized and offered to remove the extra charges for the blackened chicken and the Caesar salad ""upgrades"", which was very nice of him. (I think that was the same ""face"" that opened the little wizard of oz door when we got there).

The bill arrives and my friend pays with her credit card. There isn't a keychain flashlight on the bill, and with the lights so low, my friend misread the total as being $20 more than it actually was (we noticed her copy later in the evening in ""light"").... I am quite curious to see if they ran her card for the actual tip amount she posted or the wrong total and take the $40+ tip, instead of the $20+ tip that was intended. 

I may end up adjusting my rating accordingly when I find out if they are honest or not.",A6LEQhFIybF32FSsNVOSbg,0,0,3,qe_7dq_4oeyEuiPAv81fmg

My friend actually said that, and he was only kind of joking.

I based my first trip to Capo's on its Yelp star rating alone, and I am really glad I did so.  Had I actually read any reviews (which I did later, after eating a very satisfying meal and no longer wishing to devour the phone from which I was Yelping), my experience would not have been as cool.

I took my friend to Capo's last night, and I didn't tell him anything about it, other than to let him know that I really like the food.

From the moment the little window-hole opened in the entry-way, he had a smile on his face.  Capo's really knows how to deliver on ambience.  Everything from the decor to the dark to the hard New York Italian accents on the waiters screams Goodfellas.  I can't imagine anyone not liking the environment here.

The food is really good as well.  Be warned that the chef at Capo's LOVES garlic.  It is in absolutely everything, in copious amounts, and it is delicious.  Don't miss the Mafioso Caprese from the ""Temptations"" list.  As for entrees, I have tried Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata, Vinny's Ala Vodka, and a Cioppino that was offered one night as a special.  Everything was great and garlic-laden.  If you want to speak to anyone after you eat at Capo's, make sure that you take them with you.  If you order Uncle Pauly's, make sure that you feed them some.  I'm being absolutely serious here.

Be prepared to leave extremely full.  Bread, butter, and Parmesan cheese arrive the moment you sit down.  Go ahead and try to resist bread that is still steaming from the oven.  They'll bring your temptation order before they bring the soup or salad that comes with your meal.  You'll love whatever you get.  Then your soup (try the Pasta Faggioli) or salad (Ceasar!) will arrive.  About halfway through that, you'll remember that you have an entree coming, but you won't be able to stop.  If you order a pasta entree, the sauce will be among the most amazing things you've ever tried, so you'll definitely need to take home your leftovers.

As you might imagine, I have never gotten around to dessert.  It's good to have a goal for next time.",xed2P-Us21nsIUqGS_81Ag,1,0,5,wTf5DrdkYgUMKSS9mlcSJA

We enjoyed the singer doing Sinatra songs while walking aound the room. The food is very good with the portions being enough to fill you up. Consequently we did not have room for dessert. The chicken picata with garlic mash was excellent as well as the veal picata with mushroom risotto. The only downside to the food was the crusty bread was dried out on the inside.
The night of our visit the service could have been better. First our server did not offer us water. She seemed to disappear for a while and we had a hard time flagging down another person to help us. The restaurant was full. There was a group of about 20 people at one table. They could have had more servers.

It's dark when you go in but go with it. Make sure you are hungry or else you won't enjoy anything. The meatball appetizer satisfied my meat craving and then some. The Caprese was also just what I expected, just like my friend's mama's recipe. I had the linguini with clams and I made a mess, scarfing down everything and quaffing down some decent wine.

They use a wine sauce  that's quite distinctive to the palette and nose but it's excellent. Husband had the spaghetti and meatball which was very good. We shared stuffed mushrooms for appetizers that were good and they too were in a wine sauce covered in delicious mozzarella cheese (excellent quality cheese!) The bread was great for dipping; crispy outside, soft inside. We were seated and within one minute  our server asked if we were ready to order. I told her we just sat down (which she knew!) I asked her to please give us time to look at the menu. She maybe walked two tables away and returned to asked if we wanted any appetizers (!!??!!) which I didn't get to look at yet either so she just decided on her own to read ALL OF THEM to us (!!??!!). She did the same thing with the dessert menu and that's the only reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 5. And we felt rushed to order our lunch entree too even though I told this girl we weren't ready. We were in the restaurant less than 5 minutes and she's trying to get appetizers and entree orders from us,  we didn't even get our drinks yet! There was no reason for her to be so pushy, it was lunchtime and there were only 6 other tables. If you are going to charge high prices  I expect top knotch service! Anyway, Food was good but for the prices they charge I should be able to sit and read their menu so I could get what I wanted not what she rambled off. The gentleman who let us in was super nice and informative and the bus boys were outstanding. Our server never checked on us about the appetizer, our meal or dessert and we had to track her down for our check. I guess she couldn't get anymore money out of us so she was done with us. But know this was just the way she operated as I watched our neighboring tables get superb attentive  service and maybe we'll return but certainly we will ask for a different server.",CrEBVkzIQs7tS-wWfaCjNQ,0,0,3,dnoS3zFH6JTfs0G6bfdmYQ

I may or may not have licked the plate after finishing the salad. For my main dish, I got the The Chef Sleeps with Fishes and it was one of the best pastas I've ever had! Very tender shrimp and big chunks of prosciutto was amazing with the rich garlic pasta sauce.

Thanks so much to the lovely reservation taker for getting my party of 4 in before we headed to the strip to see Barbara! While we were in a bit of a hurry our dinner didn't feel rushed at all, the reservation lady had communicated to our waiter our situation in advance. 

Service was nicely timed, Caesar salad was delicious. My penne with vodka sauce and shrimp was overpriced at $30. 4 nicely sized and perfectly cooked shrimp, still only 4. But delicious. Be aware that they cook the pasta al dente. I prefer mine more cooked, so my bad for not requesting it that way. Vodka sauce was so good I wanted to lick the plate! My niece has declared Capo's her new favorite Italian restaurant after having the clams with red sauce...a generous portion of clams, too. One of our gals had stuffed mushrooms as her entrée and the portion was satisfying as well as delicious.

Capo's has evidently been featured on one of those food TV shows and there's definitely a gangster mob speakeasy theme here. Right up my alley, obviously. You ring the bell outside the entrance and a guy slides open a tiny window and asks what you want/what you're doing there, sort of like Robert De Niro's 'whads da matter with ya?' voice.

We didn't have reservations, which you probably should do if you want a table. It was no prob, we got seated at the bar and were fine with that.

It's really dark in here, so much so that the menu includes a little light on it so you can read it.  Good thing I checked out the menu online before so I kinda had a clue!

A bartender was our server, she was really nice and pleasant and checked on us frequently.  I'd tell you she was really attractive too, but again it was too dark to tell, so maybe it was just a guy that had extremely large pectoral muscles. Oh, she (or he?) was really good at making recommendations and answering questions about the menu too.

What we had: bruschetta, calamari, meatballs, and my main course was Vinnie's Alla Vodka.  The latter comes in at a bit under $20 and is what I'd totally recommend. The meatball appetizer also seems to be one of their signature items and is probably something you should give a try.

I know we had a few other things, but this is what I can remember.  Or, maybe it was just so dark that I couldn't see half of what I ate.

I knew the back story but the kids and wife didnt and long story short they loved it! The food was amazing across the board, even my moody 14 year old teenage son said it was the best he had ever had.

The Calamari was probably the best I have ever had, it was tender as opposed to chewy and just the perfect amount of breading. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread which was perfect, a blackened chicken ceaser(once again amazing-we like the shredded romain as opposed to the rough cut romaine) and also shared linquini and clams and the lasagna. Just a delicious meal across the board, and for a bit got to enjoy the piano player tinkling the ivories. 

The service was fine and attentative, the food excellant-if I was a Vegas local I would love to hang at the bar and listen to the piano player.

We ordered pastas my husbands sauce was decent but pasta and shrimp were both way under cooked.

This place has an old school Italian mob feel to it from the moment you walk up. Everything from the employees to the decor to the piano player all fit the part. The menu also follows suit with the dishes being named after famous mob/Italian figures from the 1950's. Now to the food, we started with calamari which was killer deep fried and a healthy portion. We also had the mamas meat balls and peppers. Let me tell you, coming from an Italian family, their meat sauce is the TRUTH! Haven't found that real authentic sauce flavor at any of the Italian joints I've hit here in Vegas so far!

We had reservations for 6:15PM and were able to sit down within 10 mins. There is a small bar to sit at also which if you sit there your able to see the chefs cook in front of you. Our server was so polite and gave us awesome recommendations. I ended up getting the spaghetti with meat sauce (huge portion) and a side salad. It was definitely the best spaghetti I've ever had.

I ordered the lasagne with a Caesar salad and my husband ordered the rigatoni with a house salad.  We also shared the caprese appetizer.  Everything we had was fantastic!  My salad was garlicky, which I loved.  My husband's salad with Italian dressing was also good, but he found it to be too salty.  The caprese was composed of some fantastic prosciutto on top of perfectly ripe tomatoes, creamy mozzarella, and fresh basil.  It was quite good.

The rigatoni with Alfredo sauce was very heavy with a mild flavor, but we both loved it.  The lasagna was one of the best I've ever had!!  I think the use of their excellent meatballs in the lasagna is what really made it so excellent.

While I wouldn't rate Capo's as a 5 star restaurant on food alone (I reserve those ratings for the particularly spectacular), the ambiance was super fun and interesting.

I think the secret door is a cool idea in theory and I love the entire Italian mob theme of this restaurant but I think asking if people have reservations and then making it seem like an inconvenience to seat you if you don't isn't smart business. We showed up before 4 pm and the host staff innocently argued in front of us about being unsure if they could seat us in the restaurant that had one table with people sitting at it. 

My partners beer showed up ten minutes after we ordered it and we waited a solid thirty minutes for my eggplant parmigiana and his sausage and peppers. My dish was good, and a very large portion which I was happy to see for the hefty $21 price, but the sausage and peppers were overly salty for my taste.

We didn't see our server too much, she was busy tending to a larger party that was seated after us. Our water lacked refills, we weren't checked on after our dinner was dropped off, and when we asked for a dessert menu she dropped off a closed book but when we opened it there was no menu inside.

I agree with the other reviews about the fun speakeasy entrance. 

We were walked to out booth, but I had to watch a few spots because it seems like the wood floor is starting to rot in spots. But you can't see it because the place is very dimly lit. There was music playing and a Sinatra-ish live singer. The music was on the loud side, but good. 

We were given menus, and then realized that a simple spaghetti is $18. And if you want to share it, they want to charge you an additional $6.

Mark H brought me here because he thought I'd have a fun time...he was right!

Capo's is kind of a mobster throwback when there was an A+ Italian restaurant on every block in Vegas.  When you enter the place, you don't enter from the front, but instead from a small, Semi-unmarked door in the back of the building!  Fkn awesome...LOL.  Once through the door, you're in a small entry space and need to ring a doorbell and talk through a speaker to gain access to the restaurant...even more awesome! :)

Once in, the place is dark with red diamond tufted banquets.  It feels like in any booth you might see people from the likes of Al Capone to Ol' Blue eyes, Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin.  All the servers are dressed in tuxedos and are extremely attentive from the moment you walk in.  

Once seated, we were happy they had Hendricks gin and each got a Hendricks and tonic.  Mark H knew that they have large portions so we passed apps and just ordered entrees.  They have some fun sounding dishes with things like Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and Vinnie's alla vodka. :)  I opted for Da Don's Lasagna and Mark H ordered a special, the Clams in red sauce with linguini.  Both dishes were healthy portions and tasty.  Shamefully I actually finished my monstrous piece of lasagna and was stuffed.  Mark H said his pasta dish was good finished it but did have quite a bit of red sauce left.  That's when I realized we didn't get any bread which should have come with our meal.  No biggie since we were already stuffed and didn't want anything else to eat.  

We obviously passed on dessert.

A pretty cool place to eat at in a town FULL of good restaurants.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,11,12,4,aTOYLcVbN31fs4xnJYiNTw

It turned out to be a disappointing disaster.
We ordered 4 entries and none of them came out right from the kitchen.
I ordered veal Parm. It comes with a side of spaghetti. There was no grated cheese offered. Something unheard of in a supposedly Italian restaurant. Did I say my Aunt and Cousin are from South Philly so we know Italian. My wife ordered the ""signature""clams and spaghetti in Red sauce. She got clams in white sauce. My Cousin ordered shrimp scampi. Not spicey. She got extra spicey. We learned later her scami went to another table. The guest of honor, my Aunt, ordered spaghetti and sausage which she didn't get. It evidently got lost in the kitchen. The waitress was very apologetic and in fairness they did take off 2 entries from our bill. But the evening was ruined.

3661168,2018-05-02,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"This is definitely a go-to spot for taking visitors for me! In pretty heavy rotation. Food is pricey but they usually have some kind of deal going on so keep an eye out for Groupon (usually a lunch deal), 5% cash back on Yelp and/or BOGO deal on Tuesdays for locals. Nice thing about that BOGO deal too is they will just take $40 off your total bill if you bring visitors with you ($20 for each local). 

Favorite part is the entrance! I always feel cool busting out with the password. Ambiance inside definitely gives you that speakeasy feel- dim lighting, red tufted leather seats, The Godfather on one of the TVs, live music after 6pm (piano, Frank Sinatra singer). They have HH 3-6p Mon-Sat if you don't mind sitting at the bar. 

If you get a salad, get the dressing on the side since they are pretty heavy handed. Cesar w/ chicken is also a fave for me. Try the Italian Duck Egg Drop Soup if you're feeling adventurous- a bit salty but hits the spot for me when there's word that there may be e.coli in my lettuce. They also substituted our lettuce w/ spring mix last night which was nice. Crème brulee is my fave dessert!

Usually opt for the picatta dishes. Pastas are all homemade, their meatballs are ginormous, so really hard to go wrong w/ that. Great service/ambiance, decent food and ongoing deals make this a 4 for me.",iOok30z2H8XVnaMeCjgqCQ,0,0,4,eaLH55427VNgyk9C6sC8MA

I can't believe I only just now found out about Capos (thanks Yelp!).

I highly recommend Capos for a romantic date night or large groups of friends. It's also a reliable attraction for your stubborn Midwestern relatives who refuse to eat hummus and sushi.

My husband and I intended to enjoy ""Fuggedaboudit Fridays,"" but Capos said ""fuggit"" to that happy hour special. But the bar honored the deal because they're cool like that.

My husband and I split the shrimp scampi appetizer, which is only about five pieces of average sized shrimp set on top of a bed of delicious bread that's soaked in butter and garlic. It was delicious but a little overpriced. Order it during happy hour instead. By the way, an interesting event happened while we sat at the bar. The mobbish door dudes fireman-carried a drunk man from the front door to the back. I don't know if the drunkard was hired to enter the restaurant that way but I thought, ""Wow. That really completes the mob atmosphere.""

For dinner my husband and I sat in one of the red round booths, split a chicken marsala (I think) and a bottle of old vine Zinfandel ($35). I would have eaten more if I wasn't counting calories. 

Capos deserves at least 4.5 stars, based on my first visit. I haven't tried enough of the menu to give it five. Right now, though, I favor Capos over Nora's and Herbs & Rye.",6Y-l3x4LpUNhTBVMTFmTmA,2,2,4,D3iLdfgk-EmNQI7PgGDpZg

3677287,2013-03-15,2,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"GREAT CONCEPT; BAD EXECUTION

The idea of the Speakeasy style restaurant dining is great. The dining experience itself: not so much.

I had to laugh when reading ""Steakhouse"" on the menu because there just weren't that many steak options. Shrimp caught my eye in a few dishes, and the clams did also. We'd heard great things about the meatballs but I wanted seafood. It's an Italian place, right? Seafood and pasta sound easy enough.

Unfortunately, by 6 in the evening they were out of shrimp.  Choice number 2 wasn't a bad one though. I had the ""Gallows with clams"" in a red sauce. It was good and had a lot of clams. The sauce was tasty. Would have been good if I'd shared it over my husband's alfredo, because that was terrible. Flavorless sauce.  His meatball however was excellent. And very large; and tender! Exploding with flavor inside! I doubt we'll return here but it was fun to check out! I'd go with my clams again and he'd probably throw a meatball on top and share.  :)

A salad with a red sauce preceeded dinner and was very good. (Husband disliked the sauce). A tiramisu dessert finished up the evening and it was great too!

We had a Groupon but it still wasn't an inexpensive dinner, for what it was. You're partly paying for the experience though. It was fun dining in the dark. Service has room for improvement! We first heard about the place from a fake reality show that supposedly took place there. I wish Food Network would stop airing that crap, but I'm glad we had a chance to check out one of the places it supposedly featured! 

If this restaurant fails I highly suggest the owner start a meatball production factory - freeze 'em and ship out! You have a guaranteed customer in California waiting for this day!",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,8,2,2,C6RWhxr7YRb7oBUfO-sqsw

When we got dropped off by the cab, we weren't so sure of our choice just based on the exterior of the building, and when we walked in the entrance, we were even less so. This is designed just like an old speakeasy. When you enter the door, it appears to be a dark closet with a keypad to punch in a secret code to enter. As we were puzzling over the keypad, a little hidden look-through panel popped open and the host greeted us (to our startled surprise!). He then opened a hidden door. When we stepped into the door, we walked into the 1920s!  It was amazing!

The atmosphere felt authentic with the exception of the large screen LCD where ""Good Fellas"" was playing. The walls were decorated with old gangsters and a very good singer was strolling the restaurant singing old Rat Pack songs.

The food was just as good as the atmosphere! Everything from the bread and salad, right down to the entree and dessert were delicious!

Looks can be very decieving, and you certainly can't judge a book by its cover. From the outside, it looked like some crazy run down saloon. I had to convince myself to go further into the restaurant hoping for more interior possas than the outter exterior. When I entered into the restaurant, I was trapped inside a fairly small room. A small computer printed sign directed us to ring the door bell, and rang the door bell is what we did! Up pops open this small peep hole where a gentleman asks if we had reservations. Replying, ""yes"" the phonebooth swings open! Just like the good old days when the prohibition laws were in effect, and the booze was sure to be marvelous.

A mobster looking gentleman, all suited up, guides us through this really dark restaurant, but even the darkness couldn't hide the small awesome crystal chandeliers, vintage wallpaper, and plush seats! I really felt like I was smack dab in the middle of an episode of Boardwalk Empire! 

I ordered the clam linuini with white wine sauce, and my partner ordered the veal marsala with angel hair pasta. My pasta was delish! If you're looking for a less filling and very light pasta dish, this would be it! I never finish my pasta, but this time I was really sad that I walked away with no takeout. The sauce was perfect. It was very light and soft, with the taste of the clams lingering in the sauce! You know that they put LEGITIMATE clams in there if the clams were tossed on your plate with the shells still on. NO CANNED CLAMS HERE! 

I can't really vouch for the veal marsala, but from what I heard and smelled, it is pretty good. It smelled like it had a very strong tangy taste to it. I was almost to tears when I sat watching my partner eat that poor baby cow...HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO COW UNIVERSITY YET! Have you no humanity friend!!!!!!!!!

Well, to wash those sad sorrows for the baby cow away, we had the bread pudding with vanilla icing for dessert. The bread pudding is DEVINE! Super soft, filling, light sweetness, and very nutty!  I felt like it was such a small portion, but being full I couldn't complain. Its such a wonderful dessert, but BEWARE! The portions are really small. 

Lastly, the staf was A+! The bussers kept taking out empty plates, filling cups, and making sure that they were accomodating. Ellie our server was very helpful with suggestions, and was really nice. Overall, it was a great birthday date! I had a great time, and my partner did too!

3734237,2012-01-05,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Ok, I read all of your blogs and comments before taking on this experience. Overall I have seen mixed reviews about this restaurant ranging from as high as 4 stars to as low as 1 star. My wife and I went here on Monday 25 Apr 2011 as a pre-celebration to my 42nd birthday. We had a 6:00 pm reservation and valet parked at the location. The reservation was honored and my vehicle was parked right in the front of establishment.

We have lived within Las Vegas since 2003 and have roots to the Midwest. I am from Chicago (truly a city kid, Southside, and White Sox fan) and my wife is from St. Louis. Service was fantastic, the hostess was very prompt with our meals, checked just enough to see if we required any additional service however, allowed us to hold a conversation with each other. Ziggy was the manager that night and ran a classy shift. Service is a 9.5 out 10 because there is always room for improvement. We were allowed to choose our seat and the crowd was about moderate size. Bummer that night no live piano, that would have made for a perfect night. Instead we had to listen to various big band, R&B, and top 40 dinner music.

I had the meatballs with spaghetti for dinner and my wife had the steak, she likes her steak overcooked. The meatballs were ok, not the best that I have ever had coming from a Black, Irish, Italian, and Germany neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago however, merited a 7 out 10. The sauce with the meatballs was the bomb, 9 out 10. I make my sauce from scratch and my wife and I almost did not get together because the first time that she cooked spaghetti with red sauce she tried using that crap in the jar and I asked her if she was making spaghetti for the dog. Lol now, but was not funny then. The steak was ok, I like my steak with pink inside so to me the steak lacked flavor, but as I said in the beginning my wife likes her steak overcooked. For desert we shared a generous serving of the tiramisu on the patio, I would go back just for the tiramisu. This was better than any tiramisu that I have had in Chicago or New York, I went to college within Saratoga Springs and Albany with many weekend trips to New York City. Overall, the food is a 6.5 out 10.

The lighting in the restaurant is dark, which I enjoyed very much. After 10 minutes or so your night vision will set in and you can easily see your meal and the person sitting across from you. Until then use the mini flash lights or the light from you cell phone. The dim light avoids rubber necking at the patrons around you and eyeballing their man, girl, and food. You have to actually look at, talk, and listen to the person that you came to the restaurant with, what a concept. Do not bring a grenade to this affair as you will be hurting. This dime eye candy action. You can barely see the people sitting at the tables around you, all you see are shadows. The true purpose and setting of a speakeasy duh............. This is not some entertainment ride or want to be speakeasy, as my wife said this is the true deal.

I found the place very romantic with a little bit of curiosity and mystery. My wife was very surprised by the door hide at the entrance. This made for a fun evening and met my expectations. Though the price is moderate $100 for two (includes one alcohol drink for each, meals for two, and one shared desert) the location, food, and ambience is not equivalent. However, you are paying to be in a speakeasy (private club) therefore, you should expect a higher price for everything in order to keep out the riff raff. If I had to explain that to you before you understood how a speakeasy works this place is not for you. Stick with olive garden or some other franchise Italian restaurant. 

My wife and I will definitely return to this restaurant with adult friends and look forward to our next trip there. I hope that this helps all and has some street cred for those of you that can read between the lines. This is not the place to bring anyone that is under the age of 15. Even then I believe that company here is best to keep at the age of 21 and older.

I called to make sure we wouldn't be turned away and the mobster that answered replied with a heavily Italian, ""Gimme a name...""

We arrived on a Thursday for lunch. We found the secret entrance, gave the eyes in the doorway the code and were granted admission. The entire place is dimly lit and mob like. Red lights flash to alert them of new visitors and creaky wood floors keep people honest. We were seated right away, in a comfy booth adorned with a portrait of Al Capone. 

All the waiters wear white pressed long sleeve shirts and black trousers with suspenders. I selected the meatball sandwich, which came with a side salad. The sandwich was amazing. The best Italian I have ever had in my life. The creamy garlic dressing is so good, you will wish you could take a bottle home with you. From the drink list, I chose ""Kick in the Head"". We visited a nearby tiki bar a bit later and let me tell you -Capo's crafts a much better cocktail. It was delicious and carried just the right punch. 

My man selected the chipped Italian beef sandwich and again, we were blown away. It's as if they have taken good home cooking and elevated it to off the charts good. Their Chianti selection is also excellent. Service was great. 

We were there too early in the day for the piano player. I am already planning a return dinner trip, so that we can experience that. I have heard nothing but great things about him.",JAFgOs6sMkZEE_nmwHXejw,12,12,5,CQ7FQv_7oePQxq8yMaxsOQ

The service was friendly and efficient. So, 5 stars for the whole experience. It's refreshing to do something different. We live in CA. and this seemed more like a place locals frequent than Strip tourists. The prices are more reasonable than Strip prices as well. 

BEGINNINGS:
I recommend Fried Ravioli as a great appetizer choice - love the pink sauce. (I did not try their famous meatballs). Heck, I would probably make the fried ravioli my main course next time by ordering two and get the (very good) dinner salad with the creamy garlic dressing for sure to start.
We also gobbled up the delicious garlic cheese bread - it also came with that delectable pink sauce for dipping. Probably could have had a tad more garlic on the garlic bread but it was still soooo good! 

 MAIN COURSES:
I did enjoy the Chicken Lucchese (sp?) as my main course. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Chicken Marsala and my friend said the Linguini and Clams was perfect. 

SIDE:
The garlic mashed potatoes were not so good to me... the skins are left on and I found them to be pasty/starchy, so probably best to skip those if that doesn't sound good to you. 

DESSERT:
Last comment is about their cheesecake. Have to say I've had much better. Should have ordered Tiramisu. 

YES:
At any rate, can't wait to eat here again when we come back to Vegas!!!!! You should definitely check this place out!",cISyqTmxU43sRO_ER56ZEw,1,0,5,rVoasMOtN8RBgFglQHS5EA

Provide the secret password after you've made reservations to get in (or take a look on their website). The speakeasy atmosphere starts from the moment you enter and extends to the host that seats you. 

The pasta was great, but the food here was definitely overpriced. A lot of people rave about the Caesar's salad, which was overpriced and overdressed. Tony's duck soup was extremely salty and ridiculously overpriced at $7.95 for a small bowl. Capo's is known for their pastas and one of the favorites is the Scarface shrimp scampi. I admit, I loved the lemon, butter, and white wine sauce and the well-cooked angel hair pasta, but five pieces of shrimp for  $26.95 wasn't worth the price. On top of that, portion sizes are relatively small (unless you get the lasagna). I left still hungry and wishing I had instead ordered the 14 oz. boneless NY strip for $10 more. 

However, people come for an off-the-Strip experience, which is what you'll get. In fact, you might even catch an act from The Magic of V, a close-up illusionist and sleight-of-hand artist. I've seen many of the tricks that he performed, but I'm always amazed anyways. Apparently there's a 9:30 show, but we were treated to a table side experience. I would probably come back if an out-of-towner was really craving pasta and a show. Just be ready to pay for on-the-Strip prices.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,3,3,3,VSZSBx6kGGQLaYh2iVtHJQ

The service was great starting from the ""greeting"". Our waitress Sara was awesome and interacted with our group very well. She certainly added to the fun. After starting with a couple of pitchers of Sangria we ordered some appetizers and onto dinner. 

My wife chose to go with the Chi Town shrimp scampi appetizer for her dinner which was really good. I had the spaghetti and vegetarian meatless meatball. Yes, that is right, a meatless meatball. I have had some better faux meats around but still the marinera sauce really takes over the taste and I really enjoyed this meal.

My brother had the lobster risotto and I had to taste it but I am glad I did; may be the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. At over $100 its something you only try on your birthday weekend but man it was good.

Everything about this place made you want to come back. I have to go get a fake NV license because I read that Tue is local 2:1 specials. Hope to come back soon.",5lhisOo609Mymwf9-4MOlA,4,3,5,D_V7ltMgXjpBfiTMUgIqyg

There was no singer so maybe our experience would have been better if there was.  We visited on a Friday at 8PM and the place was pratically empty.  There were maybe 2 or 3 orther tables.  We had salad to start and the ceaser and house salads were soaked in salad dressing...way too much!  And be prepared for garlic, the salads were very garlicly, which I didn't mind.  I had the fish special that was encrusted in pine nuts.  It seemed more like a breadcrumb coating that I just pealed off.  For $35 I've had much better.  Someone ordered the The Chef Sleeps with Fishes which was good, but not oustanding.  If you're visiting LasVegas with a car and are intrigued by the 'theme"" then it's probably worth your while assuming the singer other reviewers wrote about is there.

After a great time at the mob museum, my date and I read some of the good reviews and decided we should check this place out.
I should have looked at the bad reviews too.
When we walked in, we pretty much got yelled at because they didn't open for another hour. We said okay fine, we'll be back. 
We went back an hour later, same guy opened the door and asked if we had a reservation. We said no. He said he has no room for us and we can just go and sit at the bar. He did a really offensive gesture and then walked off. 

Still standing there in shock, like umm did that really just happen.
We decided not to sit at the bar. Especially since we didn't know where the bar was, it's so dark you can't see anything in there.  We couldn't even see how to get out, so we had to wait for him to come back. When he finally did come back, we asked him why he didn't let us know we needed a reservation when we were there an hour earlier. He said 'now you know' and left.

Service was top notch and very personable!!! They were very helpful with multiple tables in making choices in what to eat. If your looking for a popular dish to pick unfortunately your in for a long meal because there are several popular dishes even some that are not on the menu!! Tip is have an idea of what your hungry for and tell the staff so they can best guide you. 
The Sugo is as good as I have ever had in the resturant setting. They spend the time to crank out an original old world Italian family recipe sauce. 
We shared the meatball and peppers app. The appetizer comes with 2 huge perfectly flavored meatballs and some green peppers in the Sugo.  Be sure and have extra bread here that sauce is amazing. The big doms Primavera was delicious too and huge portion on the lunch menu.

It is a really cool place super super dark , which Is fine, but the darkness doesn't lean toward a romantic atmosphere , it just leads to an eyesore .  There is a Tiny little flashlight on the menu, but you Have to hold The little button down As You look at the Menu so its kind of tricky to read the menu and hold the flashlight .It's so dark you can barely see your food. Okay so I am a pretty easy going person with not much complaints ,  so let's move on to the decor . Super cool looking inside but looks kind of small , we were seated in a nice booth and waitress and host were super nice, we used a 50 gift certificate from restaurant.com which was well worth it . We ordered the calamari with peppers, and the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizers . The calamari was just okay. They tasted like the oil was a little burnt. Now for the stuffed mushrooms. They were really small little button mushrooms that were stuffed with prosciutto and smoked provolone cheese .  It seemed as though if you put your fork in it the mushrooms would fly off the fork and end up across the room  They were okay but it seemed like the chef poured chunks of kosher salt in it. As I did taste chunks of salt.  Now onto the entrees . They were very large portions my boyfriend ordered the carbonara and I ordered the stuffed ravioli. The ravioli was just okay it was cooked with peas and bacon and about 2 lbs of butter. It was way too oily for my tastes . And once more it had  chunks of kosher salt in it . (I don't know why the chef chooses to dress all the food with extra salt if your cooking fresh italian food the flavor comes from the fresh herb cheese and ingredients . Anyway  being that my boyfriend is Italian , we know really great Italian good when we taste it , and overall we were looking forward to a really great Italian meal with great pasta . This Pasta was just okay . It's good to go there for the experience , but not for authentic Italian food.",Z8HfgWzbUK8N1OxHgIu21g,0,0,3,j5YelXojgqDVou7wiXkdrA

Super down to earth guy :) There was a guy on keys back in the day and I'd sit with him and sing a few Italian tunes I have! 

Atmosphere? Capo's.... Al Capone. I mean, he really nails it when it comes to capturing the essence of how things were run back in the day. The mafia flare and history, with a sense of friendly customer service! 

Now the food? Tonight we had the cheesy garlic bread. I had the Chicken Luchesse. My mother had the Angelo, and my fiancé had the parmigiano. I heard not one single complaint! Even though the kitchen was slammed that night (we were seated at the bar in front of the cooking line) everything was presented beautifully. One mistake was my fiancé had ordered mushroom risotto but they forgot that and did spaghetti. No problem there! They brought a side of mushroom risotto right out for him.... 

Mushroom Risotto was definitely my favorite and seemed to be the general consensus. It was creamy, rich, and buttery. The consistency of the risotto was that of a pilaf compared to a calrose or jasmin rice. nom nom ... 

My fiancé definitely said it was the best chicken parm he's ever had. So expect us to NOW frequent this place yet again. 

Mom enjoyed her chicken Angelo. Lighter in flavor but the wine reduction leaves you wanting more. 

We shared cannollis at the end of the night, leaving my fiancé with the chocolate cake. If you're wanting a wonderfully thick yet moist fudge cake, this is what you want! It's really rich, but if that's your thing, go for it. I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but my fiancé certainly does. The plain cannoli had a hint of cinnamon.

Well, that's what it felt like as hubby and I had lunch at this speakeasy. The restaurant opened for lunch at 11:00a but we got there a little early and couldn't really tell where the entrance was. We parked and looked like the place was boarded up... turns out the front entrance was not so obvious. In fact, we entered in this wooden door to find another closed door that was a waiting room (no seats). We had to ring the doorbell and wait until someone opened a little peep window to let us in. This little waiting place had photos of wanted mafia members and dons. We were let inside the restaurant by a host who looked like he portrayed an associate dressed as a gangster, suspenders and all, and led us past the bar to the back section of the restaurant. 

The quiet, casual elegant setting had a mob theme with the red leather seats, the glass chandeliers, the black wallpapered walls, and more photos of mafia dons and gangsters hung on the walls. It was like a scene from The Godfather, the movie. It is dark inside. The wait staff catered to our needs as we were served green salad w/ garlic dressing, bread/butter and our orders. I had the ""Capones Carbonara"" (pancetta, tomatoes, peas, red onions, shallots & fettuccini tossed in garlic egg cream sauce). Eccelente! Mangia!!! Hubby had the  ""Vinnie's Chicken Parmesan Melt"" (chicken breast, breaded, fried, topped with mozzarella cheese and their secret sauce). If reading that description didn't make your mouth water, well, there are lots more from their menu to choose from and cleverly named with mafia themes. Our food and the atmosphere was great!

The restaurant looked like it can accommodate large groups and banquets as well as intimate dinners for two . There is a private room and it had a booth that can seat two, it also had a screen like you can watch a movie or something. This room had a door and it is in between the bar and the restroom away from the rest of the dining area. 

Located less than 15 minutes from the Strip this made our dining experience unforgettable! Thought that we would get a visit from the don himself... after all, Las Vegas had a history of mafia crime lords.

Our server was great! Very attentive and offered items that were off menu. He was also very funny. 
Garden Salad - Fresh greens, and creamy garlic deessing. Flavorful.
Calamari is a MUST try! Its super tender. It was complimented by the pepperoncinis and lemon. It had a great marinara for dipping.
We had grilled chicken samdwhiches. I had the antipasto one that had italian cheeses and meat, on a grilled ciabatta bread. Really tasty besides the hot wilted lettuce.

Parking is right outside so it's easy to get in and out. The big double doors facing west are the exit doors. Luckily there was a sign pointing us into the entrance that resembled a prison entrance. One inside the first entrance you ring the bell and a man's face pops through what was picture on the wall. After some small talk you're granted an entrance into a very dim lit restaurant. There are old mobster photos and  memorabilia on all of the walls. This place resembles and old speak easy that the mafia would have hung out in back in the day. 
Live lobsters are there at the front for you to chose from. I will advise that if you have any large members in your group to specify a table over a booth when booking your reservation. There is both live and ambient music played during your meal. Sine it is so dark inside, they have attached small LED flashlights to every menu.   
Full bar available or you can stick to their specialty drinks. 
Seating is round booth (almost a full circle), bar area or traditional table and chairs. The do have space for large parties.
We ordered the fried raviolis as an appetizer. They came out perfect! Slightly crunchy, cheesy and flavorful. Everyone ordered a sale over the soup, probably because it was over 100 degrees outside. The creamy garlic dressing was good. I'd recommend the house salad to anyone that is a big artichoke fan because there was a huge artichoke heart on top of my salad. The caesar salad was built from shredded Romain lettuce and the dressing was good there too. 
I wanted spaghetti. I was torn between the meat sauce or meatball, so I got BOTH. The meat sauce and added ONE meatball. They are a half pound each.

Although the exceedingly dim lighting is disconcerting at first, I found it strangely relaxing. A small glass of wine with tip and tax easily runs $16-$17 which I find annoying. Kudos to our waiter for recommending a lower price entree over one twice its cost when a person in our party asked which was better. Service was excellent: wait staff did their job efficiently w/o being intrusive. The place was full on a Monday night. Customers seem to appreciate servings big enough to either promote obesity or provide the next day's breakfast or lunch.

4035712,2013-02-23,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"WARNING: WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!

My bf & I bought a Groupon for here & it was out first time dining at this spot. The workers were extremely rude & then we asked to speak to the manager. He would not accept the groupon because it said it was for four ppl but the other couple canceled last minute. The groupon for 2 people cost less money but we wanted to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal but the manger refused.

So let me get this straight.....you're telling me you don't want our business? Especially since we told you we'd like to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal? Why does it matter how many ppl are dining if we just told you we'd like to spend so much more money?  RIDICULOUS

On top of that he tried to swindle us into paying waaaay more if we wanted to stay & dine. He was the rudest manager I've ever met in my life. He had an attitude the entire time & was extremely unfriendly. He basically said its our fault that we can't follow the rules.

It's ironic that I'm writing such a negative review because we initially decided to eat here after reading the positive reviews on yelp....but this was by far an awful experience.

After we left we went to Craftsteak in MGM GRAND & spent 3 times as much because we knew we'd get better service & the best food guaranteed.",f9Oxro5Lx76HLzJAt8DGbA,1,0,1,tzxqgok99b6BikQyhbK8-g

It was a lot of fun going somewhere away from the strip and the atmosphere was unique to any restaurant I've been to. The setting felt very authentic to the time period it was meant to represent.

Now for the food. Bread was, well, sliced bread, nothing special, and the butter was cold and thus annoying to spread. We got salads with the garlic dressing which was good, but would have been better with about half the quantity. Our entrees were lasagne and chicken parmesan and we loved them both. The ricotta cheesecake still has my woman kicking her own ass that we only got one slice to go versus two.

You kind of fool around near the entrance until you are vetted in. If you wanted some atmosphere before you entered, you got it. I thought I had stumbled upon a real mob joint.

The inside is much bigger than I had imagined. You get that Italian feel for the place with the distinct booth seating and the waiter's outfits. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the service in these huge restaurants can be hit or miss. It feels that there are just a few too many servers when we went. We had people sit after us get their orders taken before us. We were seated but it took a few awkward minutes of waiting to get our drinks ordered. The servers themselves were very attentive and sweet. Just a logistics issue.

As everyone knows, when you come to an Italian restaurant for lunch, the must order item is the hamburger. That wasn't a thing before? Well it might be after you eat their House Specialty, Joey's Burger. What's so special about it? Does it have bacon jam made from special Gyspys who are only found in the Western Alps? I doubt it. It's just a great burger. Meat has that charcoal grill flavor to it. The bun was sturdy and delicious. Sometimes, just eating a good burger than doesn't fall apart is what it's about.

My husband and I had a great time at Capo's.  We made reservations (which I highly recommend) for 7 p.m. on a Friday night.  We got there a 1/2 hour early not knowing how long the drive would take and am I glad we made reservations - the place was packed this night!  No biggie - we sat at the bar and waited.  We hit it just right because happy hour was from 5-7 p.m. and I had the best martini of my life for half off!  The Domitini (martini) was amazing and my husband said the gin and tonic was great too.  We also ordered the stuffed mushrooms at the happy hour rate and we were really pleased.  The host waited for us to finish our drinks and appetizer before coming over to seat us.  It was nice not to be rushed through or have to juggle drinks and a plate all the way to our table.  And it's not like they weren't busy and could have pushed us along, but the whole focus at Capo's was about customer service.  Probably the best service I've had in my life.

When we got to our table, we were immediately given fresh bread and butter and glasses of water.  The bread was so delicious it was hard not to fill up on just that.  The waiter was really pleasant and equally attentive.  We never had empty glasses and services never lagged.  My husband got the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata and I got the Chef Sleeps with the Fishes.  The Arrabiata was pretty spicy, so if you like spicy make sure to tell them only medium spicy otherwise you may not enjoy it as much.  My dinner was excellent. The flavors were really amazing; the play between the sun-dried tomatoes and cream and prosciutto was pretty amazing. what made this so good was that you could tell the pasta was homemade and fresh.  It really added to the dish.  To finish we got the chocolate covered cannolis, which we delicious.  They were on par with connolis I got in Boston in Little Italy.  Freshly-made just like everything else they serve, it was the perfect ending at a great restaurant.  When we left, I told the host that the reviews didn't do the place justice and he was genuinely pleased.

The gimmick is old timey speakeasy, mob chic.  although they didn't  put too much effort into playing that.  Dimly lit with an abundance of red leather/vinyl semi circle banquettes, plus tables for dining.  Chandeliers over the tables were for effect not a light source.  Singer was going through the motions but his voice could not be discerned from his accompanying music track, he stood behind the piano but never did play while we were there. Magician doing table magic was entertaining and capable.
We had four diners and four different entrées from Angels with dirty faces, sleeps with the fishes, Vinnys ala vodka with an added meatball (+5$)and the lasagna.  All diners were very pleased with the food, flavorful and ample servings.  Tiramisu and choc covered cannolis were better than average, cappuccino was very small and not as hot as it should have been--- needed to have the cup prewarmend.

The menus had a mini flashlight attached so you can read the menu. The walls had lots of mafia pictures up too. When music wasn't playing on the speakers, a piano player was playing. Perfect music to make you feel like you were in a different era.  

Food wise: we had fried ravioli as an appetizer that were to die for. So good. I loved the names of their dishes too. It was definitely a theme. Some of the other temptations (appetizers) were ""Bust a cap"" (mushroom caps ) and ""Mafioso Caprese"". 

For dinner we ordered from their Man Made Man Pastas menu. I had the ""Uncle Paulys arrabiata"". My friends had ""the chef sleeps with the fishes"", ""Rat pack pesto"", and ""Vinnies ala vodka"". All of our food was absolutely amazingly delicious.

I were a little early and waited about 10 minutes to be seated- although walking past tables there were several empty ones. Oh well. We ended up being seated in the bar area- so although the restaurant is beautifully decorated and there was live music the view from our table was of a basketball game on TV and the kitchen. Those chefs bust their butts! I was frustrating that it took nearly 20 minutes before being acknowledged for water and drink orders. We nearly walked- should have.

We had the red Sangria- pretty good. I had the Chicken Marsala with a side of mushroom risotto. He had the Spaghetti and Meatball. He was happy, not thrilled. I was disappointed. Chicken was okay but the risotto was complete flavorless mush. I love mushroom risotto, it is one of my favorite things, make it at home frequently and this was the most disappointing I have had. Instead of arborio rice it tasted (hard to tell with sight as it was so dark) like regular rice in a cream sauce, not the traditional risotto.

4211700,2016-01-27,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"A Chicago-based mob speakeasy, in Vegas? I was so there last Saturday night for one of my very sporadic date nights with the husband. Located in the old Hooters (yeah, I'm from Vegas, I know these things), I saw that they turned that titty-tastic 80's chicken wing place into a dark, somewhat intimate but very entertaining restaurant and lounge which adorns pictures of mafia legends of long ago. Yup, this place definitely did not resemble the raucous orange splattered nipple nightmare of years before. I was impressed. We had 8:45 pm reservations and so upon entering, you must ring the bell and low and behold, the host greets you from a small cut out in the wall above the payphone, to the right of the door and doorbell. Woo, so speakeasy. And since we had those reservations, dude had no problem letting us in. Don't know if a password is required without reservations, but one need only to check their website for more info. But I think reservations would be most advisable. 

Anyway, it's a good thing we had a reservation because the place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes past our reservation time. The host even admitted to us that he'd tell us to go to the bar, but considering how packed it was that night, there was no way we were getting a seat at the bar. Once we were finally seated in a booth, not far from the entrance, we waited a little bit for a server. We weren't in a hurry, we didn't have any other plans or anywhere else to be that evening, so to speak. But we were quite hungry and thirsty. 

Having sorta kinda studied the menu before arriving, I chose the eggplant parm and my husband tried the lasagna. We decided against any apps that night, knowing that the entrees would be more than enough. The bread basket came and there were just 5 little slices of what looked like baguette bread with cold individual foil wrapped pads of butter. I was not really impressed with that. If you're an Italian place, offer up warm breads and butter, not this airline bread and butter service! But hey, it's always been said, best not to fill up on bread. So with that, we waited for the cocktails. And because it was a speakeasy and I knew any bar hopping that we may do that night would not offer good red wine, I opted for a dirty martini with blue cheese olives and it was fabulous! The olives were perfect apps for me. The husband had his usual fancy outing drink: a Manhattan. And although dirty martinis go better with steak, I still enjoyed my eggplant parm with my drink. My husband raved about the lasagna, especially the sauce. We each took half of our food home for the next day and it warmed up beautifully. 

So I give it three stars only because of the pokey service and the bread basket. I'd like to give this place another go, possibly take my mom here so that she can check it out. I might even entertain having a steak with my dirty martini next time I visit.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,0,1,3,XdWtYRvoYdymXusCdU0_EA

2 entrees and we had the meatball sandwich ($9.95) with a choice of pasta salad or fries. I had the pasta and it wS delicious with marinated artichokes. The sandwich was not bad. The meatball had good flavor but was a bit tough. 
My husband had the Capone's carbonara ($10.95) that was delicious! 
It came with 2 beverages. He had coffee and I had iced tea and both were good. 
The service was great. The waitress was warm and friendly and so was the busboy.

Capo's is the only speakeasy in Las Vegas.  Call for reservations & prepare to go back in time when Alphonse Gabriel aka: ""Al"" Capone hung out in an underground bar during the prohibition era of the 1920's & 1930's.

Food is pretty decent for Italian cuisine, not the best I've ever had.  But you don't necessarily go to Capo's for the food, ha, you go for the environment.  Most servers come fully equipped with some sort of East Coast accent.  But provide attentive and hospitable service.

Most nights a live lounge singer will serenade you table-side to good ole favs from Ol' Blue Eyes.  Don't make direct eye-contact if you don't want him to embarrass the sheeze outta ya.  Once he sang me, ""that ladies a tramp"" ha, thanks! 

Corner location, not many people know of this little treasure, good for me, I bring all my out of town guests here.  They eat it up.

The decor is awesome, dimly lite & romantic-ish, and the bar almost always plays the movie Godfather.....or a mafia gangster movie. 
There's also a hidden cigar bar upstairs, ask your server for details. It's super small & quite ventilation retard, but cool nonetheless.

Gathered my small family and two tiny kids and got there about 2:50 pm (still before 3pm obviously).  By the time they answered the door bell and got us in and were ready to take our order it was about 2:58 pm.  Once we showed our Groupon, the server basically turned as away.  His argument - we can not accommodate you because it is too late (and that's when the restaurant was almost completely empty  - only one small table occupied! ).   

 When I argued  - well it's not even 3pm yet and I cam here with two little kids and the 3 year old was very excited about going to this restaurant, his response was:  nothing I can do, we stop serving lunch at 2:45pm even though our papers may say 3pm.  And, then, he just showed us the door we used to come in and said, ""you can use that door to come back out"".  So, that's how we were ""customer-handled"".     We were certainly absolutely dismayed and just left.

In which I learned that they could not provide the number of checks needed even though within my 6 email correspondence with the ""reservationists"" I was told that all would be fine and taken care of. My main problem was with the miscommunication of the staff, but when I went to the general manager/owner, Dominic, he suffered a lack of communication as well. And even told me that even though I made the reservation a week ago, that he had not entered it into the computer and therefore my reservation, made two weeks before the date was not made at all.

When I expressed that I felt he was being rude, he further screamed at me and dropped our reservation.

Food was ok, nothing spectacular.  They claimed the lasagna was full of sausage and hamburger meat -- there was about 3 small chunks of sausage, the rest was ricotta cheese and sauce.  Not enough to have any leftovers, which I thought was cheap for the prices they charge.

Entering the place is very amusing! They definitely take reservations, so call ahead! It would be much better that way! I've heard that this place is actually a speakeasy restaurant, which is very interesting! Since we had a reserved table it was funny to know we had an intimidating body guard by our table the whole night. Oh, the place is really dark. It took awhile for my eyes to adjust.

Since it was valentines' day there was a menu special. Came with appetizer, entree and dessert and a coffee drink (espresso I think?)

I'm not sure if it's a common thing, but our orders took a long time. I'm wondering if it's used to promote digestion between meals. But we weren't left sitting there starving, so we had alot of time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and each other's company.

There was music playing (godfather's theme 3 times in a row x.x) and a live singer was there for awhile, it was great.

Overall, I think the food was okay, the bill was big ($60-$70 for just two people)
However I think anyone who can afford to splurge should visit. It's a good experience.",a7Oby4yiZ8wHKvu2zhoC5Q,0,0,4,VjsicBCUDswnITbZtQA9ag

As we had been there previously with them and had a wonderful meal and a great time we thought sharing the experience would be fun, and we knew what to expect, or so we thought.
You enter the establishment thru a ""hidden"" door and the experience begins. The atmosphere is very Rat Pack, ""mob themed"" and is kitschy, but not kitschy in a tacky way. The decor is very dark and moody, and there are several booths if you are looking for a romantic mood.
Everyone in our group ordered drinks, wine and appetizers and we sat back enjoying each other's company and listening to a live piano player playing Rat Pack songs. (There had been no live entertainment the first time we went here, so we were very happy).
After our soup & salad were served, the most charming young man came up to the table and performed close up magic tricks! He goes by the name of ""The Magic of V"", and using cards, coins and simple rubber bands he amazed us while waiting for our entrees. 
I had the ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", which is Angel hair pasta with peas, mushrooms & pepperoni,  tossed with Capo's pink sauce, and I added an Homemade Italian ""Meatless"" Meatball, that you couldn't tell the difference.
Ed had the ""Gotti's Chicken Angelo"" Chicken breast sautéed with artichoke hearts, roasted red potatoes & mushrooms in a lemon white wine sauce. It was fantastic!
We did take home a ""Jimmy Two Times"" Tiramisu, as we're so full...Tonight with coffee after dinner Ed & I will share it. All the dinner portions were so generous, that none of us really felt like desert, but who turns down homemade Tiramisu!

4431977,2013-03-09,6,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.  

We showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.
  
After we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  ""Whatever"" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.
  
When we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.

After we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.  

I was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.  

When the waitress returned the first thing she said was ""sorry we are all out of shrimp,"" this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.  

I think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.  

So we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.

When I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.
  
After we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.

Overall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening.",ECgisJuPb15hdccyxtIzNQ,29,0,2,eM1k9i40LcM4KEQdBbdbdw

The Italian dressing that was SO good, circa the previous chef is now completely different. Now: inedible (greasy, yellow, tasteless and, just...No). Garden salad ($6) was made with rusty, wilty lettuce, carrots were stale. Nothing in it was fresh. 

Lasagna - check out my pic. I was expecting a luscious, beautiful, hearty, home-made hunk of well-made lasagna (for $10).  

During this lunch service, only two other tables were occupied in the resto, but still my server couldn't get things off the ground. We spent the next 45 minutes trying to deal with one thing after another: funky new dressing, funky salad which he accidentally charged for as it was a swap for the pasta, we ordered a meatball but no meatball arrived, waited another 20 minutes for that lasagna to get boxed up, etc...

I must say that everything, absolutely everything, smelled and tasted fantastic! Me and my girl had dessert as well, she had the cannoli while I had a tiramisu, yes it was tasty and fresh.

We started with some martinis and they were made so good and refreshing. We started with Tony's ""Duck"" soup and an order of meatballs. I don't know what's in the Duck soup but it was so good. The meatballs are what they're known for and OMG one of the best meatballs I've ever had. So moist and very flavorful. I remember watching their segment on Man vs. Food and I recall drooling over that scene and now I had the chance to be like Adam and indulge. This should be ordered EVERY TIME!!!!  For our entrees I ordered the veal parm and my side was mushroom risotto. He ordered the Lasagna. The portions are HUGE. I told him I was happy to share an entree because I didn't know if our hotel fridge was big enough. Some how it fit :p I guess my date was in no mood to share. I'm usually not a veal parm person but this chicken parm was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it and If I took one more bite, I'd get sick. The risotto was good but it was all about the parm. I've been thinking about it every time I crave Italian food. I tried his Lasagna and it was very good. Even he couldn't eat it all. Very satisfying meal.

I won't ding them for that, since most people wouldn't care. 

At last we were seated, but our table was at one of the booths lining the bar, not in the main dining room.  That meant hearing the clanging pots from the kitchen right behind the bar, along with the aforementioned shouting jocks.  A very short while later, I noticed that the couple who walked in right in front of us, who did not have reservations, were seated immediately after us in a nice, quiet room right off the main dining room.

It took quite a while for the server to come over.  He apologized, but it was indicative of the service through the rest of the meal.  Not terrible, but not attentive enough, and certainly not as good as what we'd experienced here in the past.

Prices have really increased.  Yeah, Capo's is higher end, but it's not the Strip.  At least the Sangria I ordered was a good-sized glass and was very tasty.  But the copious amount of fruit turned out to be just lemon, lime and orange peel and pith.  And the dishes are served with salad or soup, and a choice of side, so it's not all that bad.

My husband had Chicken Lucchese, with mushroom risotto as his side dish.  His chicken was a very large portion covered with mozzarella, mushrooms, capers and broccoli.  My Chicken Picatta, on the other hand, was half that size.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so this time it was enough for me to still take home some of it, but the discrepancy in size was insane, especially since his had so much more stuff on it.  And was only priced at $1 more.

When it came time to pack up the leftovers, we were provided with boxes.  I usually like to box up my food myself.  But in this case, the plates were huge and heavy, and both had drippy sauce.  After I took care of mine, Herb put that plate on one corner of the table, along with our bread plates.  There was no room to maneuver, and the plates just sat there unremoved, while wait staff walked by several times and ignored how I was struggling.  This is not a hallmark of good service.

Now for the fun part - the check.  It was not 2 for 1.  It was 2 for 1 only ""if we had ordered the same dish.""  Did it say that on the big sign outside?  Nay!  The bill was reduced by $20, not the amount it should have been.  Did it say ""$20 max"" on the big sign outside?  Again, nay.  And when we asked to see the manager, she, or someone claiming to be the manager, sat down and began a double-talk routine that would rival Abbott and Costello, telling us multiple times what I've just written above, repeating over and over that they weren't her's, but the owner's rules.  The biggest zinger, though, was when she said that the 2 for 1 was only for locals.  WTF?  Can you imagine being tourists on a budget schlepping by cab from the Strip because they heard about their Tuesday policy and finding out only at the end that they were SOL?  And did it say it on that big sign?  Third NAY.  Why would a tourist think this 2 for 1 didn't apply to them?  This has to be a blatant lie, and we don't like being lied to.  Obviously, the $4 difference in our check is small and will neither make nor break us.  But this kind of crap is not the way to run a business and alienate customers.  Is the food good?  Yeah.  But there are enough good Italian restaurants in this town with great atmosphere to ever have to put up with this.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,13,6,2,k6mTk7bZPWE0FrohjFsuVg

When you walk in there is this smell thay you just can't get passed I don't know if they are having some sort of plumming issues or what but there was a foul smell of body odor or urine and it was very unappealing and a bit hard to get out of my head. The singer has a great voice but the music is fairly loud and makes it difficult to carry on a conversation. It's dark and I understand that goes to the allure of the speakeasy theme but the lights on the menu are so bright that it really blinds you and makes it hard to read anything on the menu. The magician that came to the table put on a nice show but being that I was on a first date and he was a little sexual with my date made her feel uneasy and I think ruined the mood setting which wasn't very fun but he did do some cool illusions I will give him that. The food was great I really have no complaints in that regard I had the chicken anastasia which I would recommend to anyone that visits. I loved how They played off the mob theme at the door with the password and peephole and again the singer was great but just much to loud for a romantic setting the ambiance is nice and the decor is very fitting. I do not think I will be coming back I just can't get over that smell it was really awful but for the food alone I will give at least the two stars.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,2,0,2,n1PO7egPT0xZGRyiCWzYyg

Once inside the first door I was a little disturbed... Let's just say that it was a good type of disturbed.
Chicago Mafia-Style all the way. You get screened prior to entering in a rather fun kind of way.
Once seated it was hard to admire the appointments. I'm telling you it was so dark that they literally have flashlights tied to the menus so that you can read them. That was kind of cool and romantic since I was trying to be all cuddly with my sweetie (for the night anyway). LOL
Back to the review.
I ordered the pecan crusted Chilean Sea Bass. It was the best that I've ever had. Who'd of thought that that far away from the ocean would be the best cut of bass one can find? It was LARGE too. The service was spectacular. The entertainment had a old school Italian feel as the singer was walking around engaging the customers while dining. It was a very cool experience.

Words cannot describe how much I loved dinner here!  From the fun entrance, the decor, the atmosphere, and the delicious food!  And for the amount of food you get, the prices are reasonable. Especially after you have been eating on the strip/at hotels for a couple days!

I had the rigatoni in meat sauce with a GIANT meatball. It hit the spot!! Exactly as I was craving.  My husband had the lasagna and said it was very good.  We were stuffed full so didn't get to try dessert but I plan on going back!

I liked it so much that I took my leftovers back to the hotel and carefully transported them back home with me the next day - refused to let such yummy food go to waste!

This place has a very speakeasy-type feel to it, from the secret entrance to the dark ambience, to the decor, to the mobster movies playing on the TVs.

What we had:

Santucci's Pasta--this hit the spot for me!  I had been craving some simple, but special, spaghetti pasta and this met and exceeded all expectations!  Got it w the meatball and it just made my day...I would go back just for this dish...simple, but special.

Big Dom's Primavera--the Mrs had this and it looked amazing :-).  Full of fresh veggies of all types tossed in a light olive oil.  By the end of the meal, there wasn't a veggie left on the plate...enough said!

Da Mob Meatball Sandwich--the little one had this and she really did a number on it.  The meatballs are awesome and when you load them up in a sandwich, it was something that just makes your mouth water :-P

Truly a hidden gem in a pretty obscure area, but a place that I would seek out next time I am back in the City!

We had a rather large party, dinner was supposed to be at 8:00PM. Unfortunately, some of the party arrived about 8:20, so we had been sitting for 1/2 and hour waiting for other half of party.  Meanwhile, I could not even get a glass of water.  No bread. No waitress.  Even after rest of party arrived, I sat there for about 25 minutes until I flagged down a waitress and asked if we could please start ordering since its almost 9:00 and I have to get up for work.  She looked surprised.  I'm not sure how long she thought we were going to sit there before ordering. My husband ordered lasagna, as did 2 others.  When it came, it was cold. Hot plate, cold food.  When my husband told the waitress, she picked it up and said ""well the plate is hot!""  That is not how you treat a customer paying 23.00 for a piece of lasagna.  I'm sorry, but Maggianos service is 100% better, food is cheaper, and more of it, as well as it tastes better.  The penne that I had tasted like it was rinsed with dirty sink water.  Perhaps if it wasn't as pricey as it is, I would not be complaining as much.  But with those prices, the service should be way better.

When you walk in the front door, you enter in a little vestibule area with no windows, no doorknobs (that work), and a camera in the corner. A little screen slides open and the guy asks you what you want, kinda like a speakeasy. When you enter the actual restaurant, it's very dark (so dark, in fact, that the menus have little flashlights attached to them) but decorated well. 

I went there with a group of people. We were supposed to meet at 8:00, but not everyone showed up until about 8:45. To kill time, the few of us who were there decided to wait at the bar. After a few drinks, the bartender let us know that appetizers at the bar were half off. Sounded like a good deal, so I ordered the calamari, which was $14.99. The bill was non-transferable, so when enough of our party showed up to be seated, we asked to close out our tab. This was the first shady part:

Bartender: That'll be $10.82
Me: I thought the calamari was $14.99?
Bartender: It is.
Me: Didn't you tell us appetizers were half off?
Bartender: Well the calamari is $10.
Me: (Puzzled look)
Bartender: Ok fine. Umm...just give me $8.

We sit down at the table and look over the menu. Everything is typical Italian, but I really got sticker shock when I saw the prices. Entree prices averaged around $24, which wouldn't be that crazy for a fine dining venue, but this really didn't strike me as such a place. Anyhow, the calamari had really taken the edge off, so my girlfriend and I decided to split an entree. We ordered the veal parmigiana, which was $28.99. 

When we ordered our food, it was just after 9:00. When we got our food, it was just before 10:00. Granted there were 10 people in our group, but we were the only people in the place, literally. I don't know what they were doing, but I can't remember the last time my food took that long, even in crowded restaurants. I don't think I would have normally gotten so irritated, but I had gotten up at 3:30 for work that morning and had to wake up at 6:00 the next morning, so I had been antsy to get home and go to sleep.

When finally get our food, I ask for a separate check. I admit, I had forgotten to ask for it up front, but all the other restaurants I've been to in this town dodn't have problems splitting the check up post-meal, so I didn't think they would either.

Me: Excuse me, I need to leave soon. Could I pay for my meal now?
Waitress: I'm sorry, but we can't split the bill after it's been created.
Me: Oh, OK. Well could you please charge the amount of my meal to my card and apply it towards the bill? (I hold my credit card out)
Waitress: We can only take two cards per bill, so only one other card can be used.
Me: OK, well I know the rest of the people have cash, so I'm alright with this.
Waitress: Fine. Let me figure out what your total is.

--about 5 minutes pass--

Waitress: You're total is $36.xx.
Me: $36.xx?? What was the gratuity? I thought the veal was $28.99?
Waitress: You two split the meal. There's a $4 split charge.
Me: You didn't tell us about that when we ordered.
Waitress: It's on the menu. Here, see? (She was right. The $4 split charge was indicated, but it was on the back page underneath the desserts. Since we hadn't gotten to desserts yet, we hadn't looked at the back page.)
Me: OK, you're right, but why didn't you tell us about this when we ordered?
Waitress: It's on the menu, so we don't tell people about it.
Me: So when someone is asking for something and will be unknowingly charged extra, you don't think it's appropriate to let them know?
Waitress: Nope. We're not allowed to tell people about it. 
Me: Not allowed??
Waitress: Nope. The owner says we're not allowed to tell people about it.
Me: That's really shady.
Jen: Could we speak to the manager?
Waitress: I am the manager. 
Jen: Well then can we speak to whoever you report to?
Waitress: He's not here.
Jen: Well then how does your restaurant handle customer service?
Waitress: Fine, I'll take the $4 off.

The waitress is gone for about 10 minutes doing who knows what. In the mean time, we're eating our veal, and it was mediocre at best. I would say the meat was maybe a couple millimeters thick with twice as much breading. The pasta sauce was lacking and nothing worth going back for. I gotta say, accounting for the cost and quality, you would get an exponentially better deal at Olive Garden. 

She finally came back with our check, $31.30, and I paid. It seemed like everything worked out. However, after charging my card, she didn't stick around long enough for us to ask for a to-go container. We waited for about 10 minutes before my girlfriend decided to just go ask for one. She walked over to where the kitchen entrance/waitress station was, poked her head in, and said ""Excuse me."" When the waitress saw her, she jumped around a corner. Literally. Our waitress ran away.

The Food:
I highly recommend the meatball. One of their signature dishes. 3 types of meat rolled up sitting in a hearty tomato sauce. The stuffed mushrooms topped with mozzarella cheese is simply delish!! The gooey cheese stretches just like a freshly baked cheese pizza when being served. Calamari is crisp with a nice golden brown hue. They are not too oily or greasy tasting at all. Even the complimentary Italian style bread served is fantastic!! 

The Ambiance:
Dark but lively place with a mafia memorabilia decor in good taste. Live music daily with a piano bar and Sinatra tunes sung with true heart! If you are lucky, you might get to hear the manager belt out a few tunes on the piano. Very talented player!! 

The bar hosts daily regulars who are staples of the establishment since the early days of Capo's existence. They are warm, friendly and are from the era that will buy a lady a drink out of pure etiquette. :)

Excellent service, great drinks (try the red wine Sangria) and even the coffee is darn good because they use Lavazza. I will definitely come back!! Grazie Capo's molto buona!!",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,3,2,5,HeE79GOdk1IZ9dI1nW0cFA

Good Italian is hard to come by in San Diego, so when I took my first vacation in over 3 years with the wife, and without the kids, I bolted to Capo's like a fat man to the Paris buffett, and I wasn't disappointed.

The Host was warm and funny.  The server, I believe his name is Chad, was both friendly and patient.  The calamari appetizer and the Cesar salad were my favorite, and the eggplant canolli was probably the best I ever had.

With all that said, the best part of Capo's is the ambiance, I felt like I was eating in Capone's dining room.

Tip:  The mix drinks costs less than a glass of wine, in my opinion this was the better way to go.  I ordered the ""Watermelon"" martini drink, and it was both refreshing and potent.",F5ZD7H1uojUO6RbW6SCNpA,0,0,5,LQl9u5PmEDu6VdMFUvBh5w

Instead of being seated in the romantic main room with chandeliers, red booths and great service, we were seated in an annex room off to the side which not only felt like we were dining in a caboose, it was also right next to the kitchen!  Not romantic at all, service was terrible and food iffy.  The staff were completely overwhelmed and had obviously overbooked.   We just ordered appetizers in order to get out of that place as soon as possible.  That being said, I guess I learned my lesson about trying to dine out on Valentines day.

Being from NYC, the Italian cuisine is not the best I've had, but for being in Vegas, I suppose it's pretty good. Honestly the best part of the entire establishment is how they're set up: the entry is entertaining and the decor is also a lot of fun. It's a great place to take your friends from out of town, because it is in some ways a touristy gimmick. 

Here's a tip: Go on restaurant.com for a gift certificate and save $$ on your check. Make a reservation, it's safer to do so and doesn't hurt!",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,1,1,3,_btW62jU2-e99YekoC1Skg

Not sure if everyone giving this place rave reviews is from Iowa or something, but as someone who knows REAL Italian cooking and what to expect... skip this place. We were all so excited to try Capo's. Over 700 amazing reviews? Have we finally found our new place?

The food sucks. Bad. Extremely garlic-y, yet sauce is still bland and tasteless. Meatballs were nothing special. Cheeses don't taste fresh. Soup was weak, served in a tiny ass bowl with no gusto. The veal was horrible. Just horrible.

At one point I looked to my father, typical wise-guy type, and said ""tourist trap?""- he laughed and shrugged it off. 
 
Our waitress moved at a glacial pace and the bussers were awkward and brought food out COLD. We actually had to send it back to the kitchen. That's mortifying. I could feel myself getting angrier and angrier as dinner wore on. 

You would think for over $200 for 4 people (one of them being 7 yrs old), the food would be fantastic.

Not so much.

I will be honest that I was a bit hesitant when I saw the location. Capo's is in a ghetto looking neighborhood within a strip mall, off the Vegas Strip. I guess that consoled myself that it would be worth a try when I saw Ruth Chris in the same type of setting, but a couple blocks back. 

The entrance to the restaurant is quite fun and interesting. It is a simulated gangster hangout. You have to ring a door bell so that you can be let in. The restaurant itself is dark and you get a little light to read the menu. Capo's offers that very best service that I have seen at any restaurant. Jennine was our waitress and she was knowledgeable, attentive and looked happy to work at Capo's. The restaurant had a busboy, Jeremy who just worked his tail off and made sure that all the customers had all that they needed. 

My boyfriend and I shared the lasagna as well as the egg drop soup with spinach. It was excellent. Taste, texture and temperature were outstanding. So far, Capo's is by far the best that we have had.

The booths are old school and at this point everything is awesome. However, I am not a I need a flashlight to read your menu kinda guy. I am sure this is part of the ambiance, but It is not for me. Perfect place for a first date. We sat down and had our waitress (cant remember her name) she was kind and nice and very obnoxious as a old school waitress from back East should be. She stated that she had been there for over 13 years so that tells me about the loyalty here as this is not found in the food business anymore so my hat off to these people for treating their employees right. My son and I had the Lasagna and my girlfriend had the raviolis. The salad was on point and the bread was excellent. Before our food came we got the treat of the magician on staff. He is WONDERFUL if you have children and his tricks blew my mind as I sat 1 ft away. The singing is awesome (everything you would expect from an Italian joint) and overall at this point a wonderful dining experience. Our food came and I have to tell you, this is the first Lasagna that I had to eat slow so I could savor how delicious it was. My son stated the same and its just lasagna for Christ sake. I have had this dish at least 500 times from my girl and had to hurt her feelings ""BABE YOUR LASAGNA SUCKS COMPARED TO THIS""..... dinner was over and we had the cannolis. EXCELLENT....took them home so the little ones could indulge. Prices were a little steep for the food to price ratio. I will deff be back as I cant wait to try a more difficult dish.

I won't ruin the surprise of how they greet you, but let me just say that it sets the mood for the start of a very enjoyable evening. Having worked in Vegas once a month for work this past year, most of the dinners I've had have been very expensive and very poor quality. If you're in town and want to get off the Strip, that's where you'll find some of the better quality of Las Vegas.
Capos has it all really. The food is wonderful.... I had the Chicken parm, salad and soup. The parm was great and had a light, but very flavorful, sweet marinara sauce. The wedding soup was one of the best I've had in years too. Too much dressing on the salad, but they make their own dressings, so I didn't care. They make it all from scratch.... 4-5 different pasta sauces are available, in addition to alfredo and vodka sauces.
I was eating on a Wednesday night and they even had live music... a very easy listening Frank Sinatra-like. The service was great and the bartender and manager all take special interest in making sure that you are enjoying your meal and experience.

We had Jeremy as our server. We ordered a beer and Dino's dirty martini. I love a good dirty martini.. and I mean dirty, like swampy dirty. Drinks came out, color of my martini was on point. Took a sip and it was straight olive juice. Told Jeremy about it, he came back and said ""it was made by our new bartender, she said its a 6 count but you can order a side shot if you want."" I gave him the drink back. Our calamari and caprese were delivered. Calamari was delicious. Caprese had a good flavor but the price is way too high for what you are served. $13.95 for 3 slices of tomatoes, 3 slices of mozzarella and 3 basil leaves is a little steep. 

My husband ordered the nightly special, porter house with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies for $49.95. I ordered the ""Chef swims with the fish"" .. it was listed as Jumbo shrimp with sundried tomatoes, creamy garlic sauce with pasta for $26.95 .. 
We were served a dinner salad with creamy garlic dressing which had a great taste to it. 
At this point I was still wanting a dirty martini, I ordered another Dino's dirty but asked for the olive juice on the side. This was night and day! This was a damn good drink! Jeremy said he had another bartender make it this time. 

Our entree is delivered. Porterhouse came out great. Cooked perfectly. The pasta dish had a good taste but there were only 5 shrimp in the entire dish. I was disappointed at that since the menu said Jumbo and these were about the size of a half dollar coin. 

They offer a military discount, 10% off food (not alcohol) which is common. Our bill was $126.80 before tax. We had $21.00 in alcohol. He brought back our new bill, the 10% discount was $6.88 .. common math shows that does not add up. I understand that a military discount is a privilege and it's greatly appreciated but at least make sure it adds up to the amount you state.

We paid our bill and left.

No disappointment there!  Once inside the VERY dark restaurant the host pointed to a booth and said ""sit over there"".  We found him quite humorous. 

The food was great and the restaurant provides mini flashlights inside the menu so you can read it in the dark. Took us a while to realize this so we were using our phones at first. We had lasagna and cheese ravioli. My husband thought it was possibly the best lasagna he had eaten... And we eat out a lot.  The portions are large and served with soup or salad and bread.

The singer was great.  He sounded a lot like Frank Sinatra - at least to a non-expert like me.

Inside though, is a speak easy joint reminiscent of the mob days in Vegas. Secret passwords, secret doors, and a guy with a heavy Italian accent-I love it! You walk in and it is dark, but like intimate and cozy kind of dark. Fresh lobster tank in the front after the secret door when you walk in, bar with a full staff making drinks to the right, and escorted to my table by a wonderful gentleman who was professional and was a no frills kind of guy. Was very efficient in getting the groups and couples coming in for dinner right away. We sat in a cozy black velvet booth and there was a piano man singing Dean Martin's, ""Luck Be a Lady"". Wonderful singing. He said hello to the crowd and got to my table and dedicated a song once he found out it was for a birthday. Sang ""Unforgettable"". Classy. 

The servers were absolutely friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. Ordered the cheese bread and calamari for appetizers. The cheese bread comes in 4 or 8 pieces. Server recommended the 8 pieces, so we went for it. The cheese bread comes out piping hot with a thick layer of melty cheese on a well seasoned thick bread. Served with a side of marinara sauce. So good! The calamari was tender, lightly breaded and served with lemon slices and a red dipping sauce. Not greasy and really tasty. For the main entree, ordered the spaghetti and meatball and Fettecini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken costs extra, but was worth it. It was grilled and was a good size in proportion to the dish itself. I also had the Faggoli soup which was light and tasty.  Portions are great. Sharable really, but it's so good you may not to or you could take the rest to go. You get one very big meatball for the spaghetti dish and it was vey moist, flavorful, and delicious. The fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was rich, creamy, and buttery. Went well with the glass of wine. There was even a magician that performed some magic at our table too!

It all comes together. It's all part of the feel and experience of this restaurant. You walk in to a dimly lit dining room and bar and with Frank Sinatra music playing, felt like something in a movie. We got to sit in a corner booth and order our meal from a waiter with an Brooklyn Italian accent, just a very cool experience. 

The reason we dropped in is because we got a Groupon for a prix fixe lunch for two which included a soda, salad and entree for $20. What an great deal. The Italian house salad was fresh and dressed with zesty Italian dressing and Parmesan. I ordered the carbonara with chicken as recommended by the waiter and the lady sitting in the booth next to us and it was not at all disappointing. Creamy sauce, perfectly cooked pasta, tender chicken, peas scattered within. Yum! I wasn't able to finish it because it was quite a large serving for lunch so the waiter brought me a large togo box for me. My fiancé got the meatball sub and of course I had to try it. The meatballs were huge! They were tender and so flavorful. The bread was baked to perfection and the marinara sauce that came with it was super fresh, you could just taste all the fresh tomatoes in it. 

This place is awesome. The experience is definitely one of a kind. If you haven't been, you have to at least check it out once. I've never been to a place like it.

I really appreciated that they were trying to figure out a way to manage the experience of table side and live entertainment without the added drama of expecting patrons to tip. The place looked nice on the show, so we made a reservation and drove over there during our vacation.

We were kind of confused by the entrance and the vestibule to get in was uncomfortably hot as we tried to figure out if we were at the right place or some kind of mob front... So I guess they have it going on there. 

The server was friendly. My husband had an Italian Margarita. It was delicious. I don't care for drinking much, but yum! The cheesy bread was great, as everyone describes. I loved the orange sauce.

I was excited about the table side magician--even though it was a different guy than was featured on the show. The singer was singing along ""dedicating"" songs to everyone in the house. It was kind of annoying because he kept talking to us directly and calling us my name.  As we ate our appetizer, we noted that the table side magician was finishing up with another table--and very directly solicited a tip. This annoyed me because I had taken the show on faith as an infomercial for good, honest service without this pressure.

We passed, very firmly, on the table side entertainment.  After three times of insisting that we would rather engage in intimate conversation, he finally moved along.

Our entrees--ravioli and stuffed rigatoni-- were delicious. We passed on dessert. Had we not been driving back to the strip, my husband would have definitely had another drink--it was that good.

All in all, the food was good.  If you're into mob stuff, you'll probably love it: There are streaming gangster movies in the background.  If you're looking at reviews because you learned about this establishment from the show they were on--it is no longer their policy to refuse tips, and I think that's pretty dishonest to perform, then pretty much demand a tip.",P_FQeCdjTMPOIQryjqsWHw,4,1,3,F8YtKDpHySgJi3iZjSs2hg

From the entrance to the welcome to the service to the food to the music to the drink selection to the food; of you even remotely like Italian food, this place is the BOMB.  My 2 colleagues also thought the same thing.  The atmosphere and the ambience was top shelf.  I had the Uncle Pauly's Arrabiata which was to die for of you like some spice in your pasta.  The salad was also really good.  No appetizers because we figured the entrees would be sizeable which they were not but the salad and pasta were the perfect portion and the perfect price.  

I will most definitely be back to this place to eat, drink and feel like I'm in Chicago in the 20s.  Can't for wrong here.

Still amazing.  Great vibe, great service and some of the best Italian in Vegas.  Couple that the ambience of the music and a local magician performing some table tricks while waiting for our food was a nice touch.  Plus the fact that the prices won't break the bank makes it even more inviting.  The only caveat is if you wish to go with a small or large group, make reservations.

the feel is pretty cool, music in the background, very dim lights, cabanas, they even have a flashlight for the menu!

the bread was perfect. best bread i've had! it was so perfect, warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside with melted butter. i couldn't eaten the whole loaf!

i got their signature pasta with meatballs in tomato sauce in angel hair. pretty good! though i shouldn't have gotten angel hair. portions were pretty huge too!

i went late so there weren't that many people, and they weren't that slow. 

favourites: the breadddd

do not want: the prices are actually more on the higher $$ end, $18-$20 for a pasta

My husband wanted his own because he also was  hungry.  Also another big deal for us was that they will not split checks.  If this is not enough, they also will only take 2 credit cards per check, and even written on the back of the menu.  This was a big issue for us since we were a party of 8, 4 couples.

Sometimes you get way too caught up with making sure that you stay in particular hotels, or eat in big name restaurants, but every once in awhile you will find a diamond in the rough so to speak. At the recommendation of a local here 5 of us set out to Capos a speak easy type old style Italian dining experience. 

From the minute you walk in the door you are no longer at the Bellagio, the Wynn but back to the days of yesteryear when old style Italian Salons ruled the Vegas Empire.  A dark type setting with booths, tables, long wooden bar is your ambience with Godfather & Goodfellas movies playing in the background and Bobby walking the room singing your old time Sinatra & Vale favorites you know you are in for something different and with hope special as well. 

Prices are inexpensive here as all meals come with choice of soup or salad and several drinks at the bar were charged at Happy Hour prices even though it was almost 9PM when we got there nice touch. After sitting we ordered two orders of their meatballs and peppers with homemade spicy sauce and a Chi Town Shrimp scampi. Fresh bread with Garlic butter was fresh and excellent.  These 3 appetizers were more than enough to split for 5.  The meatballs were large not very moist but the tasty, fresh and the sauce very spicy but an excellent accoutrement to this very interesting presentation.  The Shrimp were over bread soaked in scampi sauce. Shrimp a little on the hard side, but the sauce was extremely tasty and very good.

Soups and 1 salad ordered as part of meals. Two Wedding Soups with chunks of Sirloin steak were as expected, the pasta fagoli interesting and again very tasty salads were a wet blue cheese that were very cold and fresh. Again all orders quite large and these were included in the entrees.

Dinners:  Traffacanti Rigatoni was stuffed pasta with Cheese Procusitto in a creamy Alfredo sauce. Excellent dish but there was no mention on the menu that the Rigatoni was ""Spinach Rigatoni"" this was fine as I like that but we were splitting up the dishes and it would have been nice to have known.  A stuffed Chicken Anastasia with Ricotta, Spinach covered in a pink sauce was as described and very tasty with a light coating of bread crumb as well.  A linguini carbarnaro with chicken was one of the best dishes on the table, but it had a tough time competing with the Linguine with fresh white clam sauce. These 4 dishes were split to 5 people & none of us could move after this.  

Their Espresso, Cappuccino machine was not working so we skipped desert and coffee enjoyed another drink on the house by the owner and listened to Bobby belt out Sinatra. Tough to leave this little gem but all good things must come to an end.  Very well kept little secret that will definitely be a return trip for me next time I'm in town",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,6,2,4,__jdYnmjkwbiqiNyKJCcqg

My husband ordered linguine and clams that tasted like a can of spaghettios and I ordered chicken Marsala which looked and tasted like chicken mole. I'm no chef but I make chicken Marsala with more flavor and I don't think it's supposed to me almost black and I'm going to add that I got one medium size piece of chicken. The risotto was really good though. When the bill arrived I realized they gave my young son an adult spaghetti and when I asked about that he said children meals are upon request which I feel should have been asked. We have been here before a while back and was really good then but just not even close to the same I honestly would rather have gone to Maggianos.,Fvo7k4XCZ0GkCyMdSwfHew,0,0,1,39Ntg8gDNomAdcAqLTB0qA

4774987,2017-03-27,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"While scrolling through Groupon, I noticed this restaurant that had an old school, prohibition era style restaurant. I am in love with that era (devoted my junior year project to that era) with all the organized crime, underground speakeasies, and Flapper Girls! Of course seeing this I had to purchase and am I glad I did and took my mom along with me!

On the Groupon voucher it states to call and make an appointment. When I called, the guy said not to worry for the afternoon, the evening is when it's ""really, really, really, really busy."" I actually lost count of how many times he said ""busy."" 

""Speakeasy"" is highly played upon. If you don't know, you will once you arrive. 

After we got in, I couldn't help but notice the extremely low lighting and red booths. Red chairs lined the fully stocked bar and there was an area for live music. The place isn't that big, and I can see how they get packed so quickly. There seemed to be a really intimate room where 1 party could be seated, and another room for a large party. 

Now on to the food! With the Groupon we were able to order a soft drink, salad and main entree. We both ordered the salad with the garlic sauce (I knew I'd be fighting off vampires all day, but I didn't care and ordered the garlic sauce), and Santucci's Pasta, which they are known for. First came the salad and that in itself was delicious. I don't think I've had a garlic sauce before, but it was so good. Then came the pasta. My mom and I ordered it with the meatball, mine was veggie ball, which was at an additional cost, but we wanted the full experience. The veggie ball was a soy meat with bread crumbs and herbs. The sauce is home made and was just perfect. A little sweet and covered my pasta without drowning it. My palette enjoyed the whole dish. I had to stop myself. My stomach was telling me no, but my taste buds were telling me yes. Needless to say I took some home. 

I forgot our servers name, but on the receipt it says Santana. She was great! All of the people there were on top of it. When you finished, someone was there to take your plate. Drinks were never low and they always checked on you. They have a sense of humor, too which I love.

When we went inside, before entering the actual restaurant, there was a room where you have to ring the door bell to enter the restaurant. It took them 5 mins to let us in; making us wait in the cold. 

Once we get in and got table, it took the waitress 15 mins before noticing that we were here. 

soooooo the service was a bad. Now the food....

We ordered, the scampi shrimp and the rib eye steak dinner. it was OK, nothing special. the rib eye steak  comes with the steak and mashed potato, and THAT'S ALL. I can go to walmart and make my own steak for like quarter of the price.

I looked at how many stars this place had and of course the pictures before we went.  However, I am so glad I didn't read all the details and we went to the location and were surprised.  As much as I want to put all the details of my favorite entrance at an establishment ever on this review, I will refrain so others can enjoy it without expecting it as well. 

Once you are seated, you are amped up from the entrance and things keep going up hill from there.  We immediately ordered our drinks and began to look over the exquisite menu.  

Only down fall is that we went at dinner time, and I have 2 picky teenagers. They both wanted to order meatball sandwiches, which is only on the lunch menu and you cannot order for dinner.    They were also out of lasagna which would have been a 2nd choice for my kids.  

I ordered the chicken Anastasia with a side of spaghetti.  The chicken dish was so amazing.  The chicken was crisp and crunchy on the outside which is so unique and appetizing.  I didn't try the spaghetti, because I am not really a fan of spaghetti (it is always boring) so I took it to go.  Later that night, when I gave in and decided to eat the left over spaghetti, I was absolutely shocked; it was so tasty and flavorful.  No one, not even Spaghetti Factory has such flavorful spaghetti. Oh and my daughter upgraded to the Caesar salad (she let me have a taste) and I was so jealous! It is not your average salad and I was craving it all the next day. My salad had artichokes which was off the hook. 

The atmosphere is classy, and since it was dinner, our candles were lit and the lights went down.  We did get to enjoy the piano being played toward the end of our stay.

She never came to ask us if we wanted more drinks, or any more water. We asked her for a couple of things (oil and vinegar, silverware) and she never returned. We wound up asking one of the nice guys that was refilling water. We brought a new couple and another couple that had visited in the past, so we explained that it wasn't always like this.

4917220,2015-10-06,2,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I recently had the chance to have dinner here with a friend from out of town. I have heard many a story so off we went. 

   I found from other reviews that reservation are a sure fire way to go. so I made our reservations and got the password. Others had stated that with out a reservation there visit was not as enjoyable as it should have been. So off we went with password and info in hand..

  When you get there its just a rectangle building nothing fancy, and you really don't have to hunt for the door its pretty easy to spot. Once you enter the whole mob atmosphere is in full play. Dark mysterious and a bit unknown. I wont go into to much here as its an experience in itself, But ring the bell and wait...

    Once your inside, its a very lively place.. you enter by the bar and its all old school inside. and the matradee takes you to your table. Now had I known there where 2 rooms I would have requested the main room when placing my reservation. The back room is small and you can not see much if anything that is going on int he main area. Its also seems to be where the place you if you brought your kids..( which I do not recommend ). And it is right by the entrance to the kitchen so a bit busy and noisy. But it does have its own charm. 

   All the chairs and booths are covered in red velvet, which was a nice touch. The music is mostly from a live singer who is doing all the Sinatra hits for the era. We could hear him but not see him as he walks around and sings. 

   Now I had heard some really bad things about service, so I was prepared. We sat for a what seemed about 10 min with no one addressing us, I was hmmmm, but then a waiter came to the table and got our drink orders and appetizers. Did mention its dark in there? they give you little flash lights to read the menu by.. Thought is was different. The rest of the night waiter service was excellent. Never had to ask for anything. So slow start but nice recovery.

   They bring you out bread service, which is nice portion of a fresh sourdough. Or apps and salads where out in a rather timely fashion and where outstanding. I recommend the garlic bread and sauce, I don't know how they make the sauce but it was one of the best I have tasted in a long time. Our meals arrived to the table timed perfectly. The portions are large but not over bearing the plate. plenty to take home. Food was hot, plenty of sauce and delicious. Again the lasagna was fantastic and if you order a meatball its about the size of a softball..  Its a meal by itself.

    We where asked if we would like any desert and we passed as there just was no more room. we where not hurried at that point either. we finished our drinks and chatted a bit and then decided to head out. as we got up from our table we where thanked for coming in and we made our way to the main room. at this point we where escorted to the exit. Much like you would have been in the day. you exit through side doors to the parking lot. As we where leaving we took a few minutes and just looked around the room..  lots of old photos and posters.. you really get the feel that the Mob bosses may have been in a corner booth conducting business.. 

     I highly recommend you give it a try, if nothing else just for the experience. And don't forget the password!! the guy at the door doesn't like that..",r2wK-bxWTIRTupmbOcrEWg,0,0,4,ZJJJzf1AUQjZn7J6xyQ62g

I have been told of Capo's by several friends and family so when I finally moved here it was one of my first restaurants to try. 
It gets quite busy here on any given night so reservations are a great idea! Don't forget to ask for the password. The entrance is on the back side of the restaurant right by the parking lot. Once you enter be prepared to share the password!
Once inside it was like stepping into a different world. The restaurant is dimly lit with live entertainment (jazz singer) and smells deliciously of authentic Italian food. 
My party of 3 did not have a reservation, so we had a seat at the bar. The bartender was very prompt and friendly. She made great drinks as well. 

I started with the house salad with homemade Italian dressing, it was great! The dressing was very obviously homemade. On a future visit I would love to try a dinner/entree salad. 
We were served warm bread with butter... yummy and great starter to the saucy meals. 
My party and I were for warned that the portions are huge. With that advice I split Da Don's lasagna with my fiancé and we still left with 1/2 of the lasagna. Which by the way was great reheated at home the next day. The lasagna was simply delicious! Great sauce, lots of cheese and nuggets of Italian sausage in between really satisfied our Italian craving! 
We enjoyed the sauce so much we purchased some to take home. They have two varieties traditional and spicy. We purchased both and they run $7 a jar.

The ambiance of the restaurant cannot be beat.  I've been to the Flamingo location many times and have always loved it.  I was happy to see that the decor and general atmosphere of the restaurant was very similar.  After being seated, our server took a while to take our order, but she was super friendly.  We ordered the antipasto appetizer, which is basically a salad, but an AMAZING salad!!  It was delicious.  Only problem was that salad came with our entrees as well.  Anyway, the antipasto salad was awesome.  Then our dinner salads came, both with blue cheese dressing, and they were pretty disappointing.  They lettuce was completely swimming in dressing and I didn't have more than a couple bites.  Maybe next time I will ask for dressing on the side.

My date ordered the ravioli trafficanti, and I ordered the rigatoni with arrabiatta and a meatball.  His dish was delicious!!!  Unfortunately, we were super full already at that point from bread and salad, we only ate one of the giant ricotta stuffed raviolis.  My dish was...just ok.  It wasn't bad, but there was absolutely NO wow factor.  The meatball was not GREAT, but definitely good.  The dish just looked and tasted like something I could make at home with boxed rigatoni and Prego sauce, and throw in some chili peppers.  Voila!  Next time, I will have to remember to order something more complicated.  I would say over all, the food was a 4.

Service.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but our server seemed to be running around like she was completely swamped.  She may have checked on us only once throughout our entire meal.  Before our entrees came, we ordered wine so that we could have it with dinner, but our entrees came and we ate them and our server finally came back and said the bar was backed up and our drinks would be coming soon.  We just told her to cancel them because we were done eating!  I looked at the bar and there were 3 people sitting at it and the bartender just putting glasses away and chatting with the barback.  Then she took forever to bring us our check, and to take it after we put our credit card in it.  Overall, the service kind of sucked.  That would be a 3.

So I'd give the restaurant in general a 3.5, but since we can't, sorry Capo's, I have to round down because it definitely was not a 4-star experience.  I've always loved this restaurant because of it's unique experience with the entry way, the Sinatra-like singer, and the ambiance, but this time was mildly disappointing.

The BF (now the Big F) and I walked in without reservations on a Sunday evening.  For our party of two, we got to sit on stage.  For future reference, there are very cool romantic booths also available.

We went straight for their ""Made-Man Pastas.""  The Big F chose ""Capo's Lasagna"" for $18.50.  It's ""lasagna pasta layered with Italian sausage, crushed meatballs, ricotta cheese and fresh herbs topped with Capo's special sugo and cheeses.""  He also added a Homemade Italian Meatball for $6.  (Although it does say 'meatballs' on the menu, it's really one big meatball.)

I chose the ""Tortellini Trafficante"" for $18.50, ""pasta rings stuffed with cheese served with proscuitto, peas and mushrooms in our creamy alfredo sauce.""  I also paid $4 for the added Italian Sausage.

Both dinners are served with bread, butter, and a choice of Pasta Faggioli, Tony's Duck Soup, or their House Salad.  We both chose ""Tony's Duck Soup"" because the name sounded crazy enough.  They describe it as ""Italian egg drop soup with garlic, spinach, and a touch of crushed red pepper.""

The soup was simple, but a bit too salty for my tastes.  Although the Big F enjoyed his lasagna, he thought it could be better.  He did finish it all up though.  My tortellini dish was good with its creamy sauce, but definitely very heavy.  (I had leftovers.)  The added Italian sausage wasn't particularly a favorite of mine either, perhaps my tastes aren't refined enough.

As a result, we never made it to dessert.  With names like ""Ma Barker's Cobbler,"" ""Leo's Lips Lava Cake,"" and ""Dillinger's Chocolate Covered Cannoli's,"" you're saddened you missed out. 

For the ambiance, I'll give it a solid five stars.  The restaurant really does make you feel like you're part of this secret society.  It would be great for groups or a dinner for two.  

In terms of food, I'd give it a 3.  

Overall, a four star rating.

3.  Nothing we ordered was paced!  You shouldn't ever be served the next course before you're done with the prior course
4.  We had to ask the busser for a bottle of wine because our waitress was AWOL
5.  Ordered dessert with the busser because the waitress was again AWOL
6.  When you are serving a good product you don't need to hide it in sauces

When the waitress was available she was great but after our meal arrived we were never checked on.  

We wanted to LOVE this restaurant but will most likely visit for drinks and appetizers at the bar only.

The restaurant would be best as a place to meet up and drink but not as a dining destination.",R7M0ZqgEyqQN9wsKn12lNQ,0,0,3,hjN-hSaPrZHBw9nSkHnRcA

Once you drive to this restaurant, my impression of the outside, very ghetto. It does look it but it really is not. Its a really unique and cool experience dining here. Besides the look when you enter it will be very gangster, very mafia, mobster feel. Don't let it bother you, me & my other half really enjoyed our lunch. It was our 2oth anniversary lunch. Our Las Vegas trip was for our 20th anniversary celebration and on our special day we dined here. We both had no complaints. 

As a FYI- be prepare to eat in the dark, look at your menu in the dark, once you enter and once you get to the table, it is very dark. Guess its a great way to hide from the mobster!! haha. If you don't mind the dark.  My opinion, this is much more romantic. I had a hard time finding the bathroom in the dark and I had to go with my other half. It was really hard taking photos, you will need to use the flash on your phone. 

We were in the area stopping at The California hotel and I recalled driving by this place,so I checked Yelp and the ratings and food photos looked awesome so Capo's we will go for lunch. They have a great lunch special so we opt for the special. 

OH my!!, Our meals were really delicious except for the salads were mediocre. Our pasta were so authentic. You would be surprised that this place has such amazing food. Our lunch entrées were Capones Carbonara - the fettuccine pasta were al dente, the carbonara sauce was just right, not too rich. Big Dom's Primavera- Penne pasta tossed with fresh vegtables- really loved that the penne was al dente and loved the vegtables sautéed perfect together. Me and the other half tried each other's entrée and we enjoyed them both. The entrée has interesting names but the description sure matches its name. 

Amazing food, great service, and Unique Mobster experience, you have to come check it out for yourself.

Next visit I want to try the calamari, a different entrée, and the cannoli. 
 I can't wait to be back and I will definitely be back @ Capo's during my next Las Vegas vacation!!

As a local, this is my go to spot to take my out of town guests who visit for an authentic Italian dinner. The atmosphere is sooooo cool. I love the speakeasy style (and the entrance is the best!), dim lighting, chandeliers and Mafia movies playing in the background. Although best for an adult date night or gathering, I also bring my kids here as well. One of my favorite things is the live singer there on Saturdays (and possibly other days of the week) who plays the piano and sings classics from that era (think Frank Sinatra, etc.) NOW...let's get to the food. The meatballs are out of this world. The shrimp scampi is amazing. You must try the mushroom risotto. My 9 year old son loves the fettuccine alfredo. My husband loves the chocolate dipped cannolis for dessert. Service is always on point. I recently threw a dinner birthday party there (of 14 people) for a friend. We had to change the number on the reservation a couple of times and they were very accommodating. They were super attentive and friendly with excellent service while handling that large of a group. They went out of their way to acknowledge the birthday girl and help make her night extra special.

All the house wine, beer and well drinks are half price along with appetizers. I think that is from 4pm to 7pm., not 100% sure about times.  We had drinks at the bar and shared an order of Calamari...(It was huge and so.o.o.o good. ) The dipping sauce was fabulous.   Since everyone said the portions were huge, we decided to split an entree and a desert.  We told our server our intentions and there wasn't an extra plate charge or any problem with sharing.  They even divided the entree into to separate servings which we still couldn't eat all of it....By the way, we had ordered spaghetti with the meat sauce.  The meat sauce was a mixture of Italian Sausage and ground beef...It was excellent...I wish we had this place in Atlanta.  For desert we ordered the Chocolate Molten cake with vanilla icecream  It was so yummy.. My husband is Italian so he loved the Godfather movies playing on the bar t.v. and he loved the singer coming around singing Frank Sinatra songs.

I loved the mobster throwback feel once inside.  From the pictures and some mug shots of gangsters on the wall to the low-dimmed lighting, it really set the mood of feeling like I was in a restaurant from years past.  Our group of 6 were quickly seated and attended to, and I said service was very good. 

Now for the food--all very good!  We went with their lunch specials, and for the most part everyone in the party ordered either the meatball sub or the Italian beef.  I had the meatball sub, and boy are they some good tasting (and good sized) meatballs.  However, the Italian beef was EXCELLENT.  I would definitely get this next time.  Great flavor, great texture, the bread was delicious (as was the hoagie the meatball sub came on).  

Sandwiches came with a choice of side: either french fries or a pasta salad.  My parents had been to this restaurant before and said neither side was that great.  Their complaint was the french fries came with some sauce of some kind already on them, and they were not a fan.  The waitress said they could do the sauce on the side, which I went with--I have no idea what this sauce was, but it was delicious!  So delicious that I definitely could have been looking the little bowl it came in clean with my finger.  I'm very excited to go back and try it again with the sauce actually on the fries.  Morale of the story: Don't listen to my parents (That's why they aren't Yelp Elite!).

I love the theme and how you have to enter the place,
although the inside is very dark, it's just part of the atmosphere.
The singer was very very good and not over bearing.
The prices are a LITTLE high but the portions and the quality were FANTASTIC!

Service was not bad, but we definitely had a new server that didn't know how to talk to guests. I'd say he was in his very early 20s and would touch my dad on his shoulder a few times, he's call both of us bro, bud, etc . If it was part of the atmosphere of the place then yea it's no problem but in this case it wasn't. Although he was attentive (which I definitely appreciate) and he was nice and wasn't at all rude, he needs to learn how to talk respectfully to his customers.  All in all he did a good job and he'll learn. 

1 thing that was a big disappointment.. DESSERT!  I have been to Noras and now here and both have awful desserts. I tried the Tiramisu here and it was blah!  I haven't met an italian yet in vegas who can make a good Tiramisu, they make it the american way and it's not very good :-(

The staff was overall friendly and they even had a guy singing a few songs throughout the night. There were four of us and everyone really enjoyed their meals.
""The Gallows With Clams"" - had been craving fresh pasta with some red clam sauce for a long time and this absolutely satisfied that craving. A bit pricey at $23 but it was a nice size portion with a good amount of clams. (similar dish at Maggianos which is on the strip is only $16)
""Mad Dog Marsala"" w/Chicken + mushroom risotto - Kacey ordered and enjoyed but way, way, way overpriced at $28. The meal is listed at $24 and the waitress listed off the sides available. However she failed to mention that the risotto was going to add another $4 as a substitute. Way overpriced for one piece of chicken and a little side of risotto.

If you don't like dark places, avoid this place like the plague.  Expect generous portions, so bring your appetite.  They even provide a lounge singer.

The bread is awesome, it's nice and crispy, served hot... add some butter, it really hits the spot.

The calamari was excellent, only comment is that we wished that they included the squid legs.  The sauce the comes with it had a perfect balance, not too sweet or sour.

The clams linguine ""The Gallows with Clams"" with white sauce is another good entree to choose.  The noodles were firm and sucks up the flavors of the dish.  The clams were on a bit on the side but perfectly cooked.

We had high hopes for their famous meatball with spaghetti, as we hear several servers pushing this dish.  Nothing that says wow gotta get it, but still solid.  You get a big meatball in the middle of a pile of spaghetti.  The meatball was slightly fluffy with yet the density of the meat.

The ""Sawed Off Sausage & Peppers"" was not to our liking.  The red wine is too overwhelming and dominates the flavor of the dish.  So much that even the sausage is not spared from the overwhelming wine flavor.

Why the three star rating?  Our waiter was horrible, barely stopped by to see how we were doing and wasn't helpful at all.  For example, he didn't mention the Tuesday night special, we only knew about it by eavesdropping on another table (I'm a former Auditor).  What saved them was the busboy and other supporting staff that filled in for him.  Also, the prices were on the high side, in the low $20 to $30 range.

The one thing I'm always impressed by is when you have a large group of people, and they provide excellent customer service. We had a group of 11 people and only 1 waitress. She was awesome and amazingly attentive the entire time.

 I was very nervous because my boyfriend's grandparents are obsessed with Italian. I never recommend places that I haven't been to, but all of my friends that I trust had recommended it to me. I'm so glad I made the choice! Everyone loved everything they got, and the best in my opinion was the Chicken Marsala. Most of us passed around our dishes to try everything out, and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I do love Italian, and I have been very picky on the places that I like. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. I just feel they're all the same and generally the same ""OK"" type of quality of food. There are a few exceptions, but I usually shy away from these places. 

I see people on here complaining about the prices. I feel that the prices are very reasonable, and here is why - 
The dinners come with bread, soup or salad. 
They give you large portions (even though I typically appreciate smaller portions so I don't over eat.)
They have live entertainment, I'm sure it's mostly in the evenings. 
The ambiance and the experience. It's cute and ""mob"" style. 
The service. I always pay attention to the service and the service around me, and everyone seemed very content. The singer and the manager even thanked us for coming in and dining with them. 

People need to take in account for everything, not just the prices, especially if it's worth the prices and it's good food. 

I know it may not be consistent across the board for everyone, but I had an awesome experience. Go to their website, look at their menu before you go. It's definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys something different than the norm.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,11,5,4,yaFjfuRt7Frif7hf9LV_cQ

This restaurant was dark,(they have tiny LED lights to view menu which are difficult to use if you have arthritis in your hands),  unfriendly,  terrible service, horrible food and were very DECEPTIVE with their bills. This was by far the worst eating experience of our lives. Caution to anyone who does not know the owners! The food was so bad I couldn't eat it. Who ever heard of Pasta Fagiola with crushed spaghetti, no beans and jarred garlic? The eggplant rolatini tasted like old cheese with jarred garlic overkill. I just couldn't eat it. The chicken picata was bland like lemon was squeezed on it. The mushroom risotto was hard and undercooked. My husband couldn't eat his eggplant either! No one enjoyed the food or the atmosphere. Then came the bill. LOCALS BEWARE! Sundays is pasta 2 for 1 (up to $20.00 only). If you don't tell them you're a local, you will be overcharged. Then there's the issue of the bill. It is a light carbon that is not ledgible! There were 2 prices on the bill (hand written). They charged us extra because they said they didn't know we were locals. Well, I let that go. I got back my adjusted bill and credit card back which had a transaction on it. Again it had 2 prices. $130. and $165.  I questioned the waiter again!  He said they included gratuity. Well, the ""gratuity box"" was blank and he wrote ""Grat"" over a preprinted ""Thankyou"" on the bill which was not ledgible. Also, it seemed to all of us that they charged OVER 20% for a TIP! People who don't know are going to be in for a rude surprise....Double tipping! We would never go back to Capo's again. My only mistake was complaining after the meal and paying for that horrible experience. All I got was an apology! Not a compensation by a long shot! And by the way, my bill originally started at $226. and went down to $130. which was still too much for the quality and service  received. Does anyone see a problem with a $96. difference? That's after having the waiter review with us 3 times as to what we were being charged for! I could not in good faith recommend this restaurant!

The meatballs were great, clams and chicken was awsome but I do have to point out.  Their mushroom risotto was TO DIE FOR!  YUMMM.

My girlfriend had the lasagna which was hard on the sides overcooked, during our second glass of wine they kept trying to rush us out before and after I pay the bill.

It's funny the waiter would open a peep window and look and let us in.  Just like how the mafias back in the 20's were.  Lol it was kind of dark inside, lots of poster of former Mafiosos and big bosses such as Capone, lucky Luciano and so on.  All these time i was there I was expecting to be gun downed by a rival mafia lol.  It was really an original setting with a touch of Italy !!!! Or should I say Sicily .,,,

The waiter and waitress were dressed non black... The make attendants wore white suspenders.... Just like what machine gun kelly would look back then.

Any way we got our food, it was a full lunch meal with salad as starter and bread, I had me a ""vinny"" chicken Parmesan.  It was pretty good.  Hey if you ever be in Vegas and want to feel like the mafia is around you ... Come to this place ...",AoSGGPQDuICxP8LUOyIa9g,10,7,4,YCVPSMOUaU4DLJWpdLWDAA

This place is pretty cool. We all had a good time and did not have trouble finding something to eat. I choose the Trafficante Rigatoni and a raspberry/ lemon martini thing. Both were very good. They use real oils and top notch ingredients. This is not your local Noodles and Co. 

But with that said this place is on the pricey side. For my dish and my drink it put me back $25.00. Altogether for our party of 5 it put use back $137.00. So be prepared for that. When we finished we took a few pictures with the chalk drawings and the old school car outside.

The rest of our party ordered their food and said it was just ok but the prices are way to high. The piano player was way in a corner and he kept singing to the wall instead of the crowd. There were two birthdays at our table and not one did one thing. The waitress was polite but not friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

Waitress disappeared again, we asked for another waitress to get a manager for us to speak to.  I guess she told our waitress, because she came out claiming she was the manager herself.  Fine, I told her that it all makes some sense now since you are the manager, probably have other responsibilities other than checking on your tables.

He found Capos on Google. He was looking for something special because I had just gotten a promotion at work. So he found you..made reservations and we went. We loved the entire experience we had. The ambiance, the service and the food!!! 
Must try the Meatball...so good...I am not a huge fan of meatballs but this one was said to be the best and it was.
The names of dishes are quite funny...I had swimming with the fishes...a great shrimp pasta meal...which you could tell the pasta was homemade! My fiance had Lasagna which was so big he couldn't finish it...he said it was the best he ever had. The Sauce was delicious. Probably the best sauce I've had in a restaurant.
Now for the service... better than 5 stars both times we have been! Never were our drinks empty, very friendly, very attentive.
The 2nd time we came we had told another local couple that are friends of ours to come with us. They had said that they wanted Italian food...so we said we have to go here...we sat in the main dining room this time, had a magician who was amazingly funny and had us stumped on how he was doing his tricks, the lounge performer really set the mood for old school vegas, and once again, food and service did not disappoint.

5458212,2015-09-02,9,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"I had high hopes for Capo's Italian Cuisine.  Two stars is all I can come up with for this place.  Somethings are on me.  Like not really mapping out how far this place was from mid-strip.  We paid $27.50 + a $5.00 tip for a taxi from the Monte Carlo.  So figure you're into roughly a $65.00 round trip cab fare just to get here and back to your hotel.  That was on me.

It was 100 degrees outside in the early evening.  The secret door was kinda of fun.  We gave the password to my GF's daughter to get us in.  First impression, it's hot in here.  77 degrees inside.  The host seats us at the first booth we come to in the bar area facing the bar, a TV showing the The Shawshank Redemption, and the open kitchen.  Heat from the kitchen is coming right at us.  Not good.

I got up and asked the host now sitting at the bar if we can be seated in the main dinning room which is pretty much empty.  One booth out of five is occupied.  There's a big table set in the middle for maybe a party of ten?  I don't know.

The host says-
Well, you know here's the thing........we have a big party coming in and....we gotta lot of reservations.....and let me see what I can do....and I'm not to sure.....and let me check on something.....and so on and so on. 

My inner monolog is saying to me-
This guy wants me to break out some cash for a better table in this empty hot and stuffy restaurant.  Are you fucking kidding me guy?  I just shelled out over $30.00 bucks just to get here!  Really?  I'll stand my ground.

The host continues-
Yeah, you know we got this big party coming in and we are really busy and, and, and.........Okay, okay, okay, I'll get a booth setup for you.  

For the record, only one other couple came in while we were there and the big table got broken down and put away half way through our dinner cause no one ever showed up.  Now, I have no real proof he was shaking me down, but I think he was.  Not cool.  

We got the temp down to 72 degrees and things were looking up.  Martini time.  I had two and they were good.  Our waitress was very nice to us.  Oh yeah, as others have mentioned it's pitch black in here.  99 Cent store mini flashlights that weren't working very well are attached to the menus.  It was a struggle reading the menu.

Food-

Fried Calamari-
Not bad.  No tentacles.  Boo.

Me-
Salad- Over dressed and limp.  
Veal Parmesan-  Surprisingly good.  I always give credit when due.
Pasta- Under cooked.

Queen of Reseda's Daughter-
Soup- Bland.
Racketeers Ravioli- She liked it.

Queen of Reseda-
Soup- Bland.
Veal Marsala- Chewy, she did not like.
Pasta- Under cooked.

Entertainment-
The live Frank Sinatra type singer was cool at first.  The Queen of Reseda's daughter was the only single looking female in the place as far as I could see.  
He serenaded her once, she liked it.  ""Return to me.  Please come back bella mia""
He serenaded her twice, okay fine.  Move on Broheim. 
He serenaded her a third time and it started to get really old, really fast.  
We laughed about it later, but it was borderline uncomfortable for a while there.

After dinner we asked if they would call us a cab.  They have there own driver which they offered to take us back to our hotel.  It was a flat $25.00 plus I gave him a $5.00 tip.  We took them up on their offer, the driver was very nice and got us home safe. 

IMO these guys have figured out how to stack the deck with the Yelp reviews.  Soon after I posted this review, four new five star reviews mushroom up pushing this one down.  Take notice how most of these reviews are pretty short and sweet by people with not a lot of friends.  

Some guy wrote how it was packed on a Monday night?  BS.  We were there on a Sunday night and it was dead.  I wish I would have checked out the 166 other reviews that are not currently recommended before coming here.  166!  Check them out for some very interesting reading.

The whole speak easy idea is adorable and definitely fun. The hidden entrance, the password, that whole deal. Very cool. 

The food is definitely good, but certainly not the best this Italian has ever had (and not even the best in Vegas, for that matter). Still, I'd have no problem going back. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals, plus the basil butter with bread was a nice and yummy touch. Oh, the dinner salad was also really great.

The service, however, was fantastic. Drinks were refilled promptly without us ever having to ask, food came quickly and was both fresh and hot. The staff were all incredibly friendly and they gave the place a fun, laid back but professional vibe.

Our server recommended the meatball appetizer as they are ""known"" for them; you get two large meatballs served in their sugo sauce with peppers. These were flavorful and large enough for a party of four to share.  Entrees for the table included Eggplant Parmesan, the Alfredo, and the sausage and peppers (appetizer). All came with a salad (dressings were good). I loved the fact that with the eggplant you could order a side of risotto instead of pasta. The eggplant was good, but the risotto was amazing.

She brings the pepper flakes and then 2 minutes later a ""manager"" (You are no manager). A guy dressed in a server outfit comes to our table.  He apologizes and does nothing to help the situation.  All he did was comp off the glasses of wine we didn't touch because we wanted to drink it while we ate... Which we never did.  They boxed our food and we left.  Our waitress only got 10% tip due to the fact that I know she has to probably tip out other people.  They don't need to suffer for her lack of work.  As for the so called manager... You sir, if you are a manger, needs to figure out how to make this restaurant work.  I think your lack of customer service is a problem.  I believe re-training people and truely understand how to make your guest feel special is key.  Especially on special occasions.",cHT1nAOsrDbf7T6u-Z5-8g,0,0,1,T8c3h3O4vHyXmiWixn96YQ

We checked out the website and were really intrigued, it looked fun! Then to top it off, we found a 'Groupon Now' deal that was $25 for $50, so we gave it a shot.

When we got there the entrance was confusing, we thought we were in the wrong place. But we were delighted when we were greeted through the little hidden window and welcomed in. Instantly we knew this would be a place we'd return to. The decor is so romantic, velvet wallpaper, red leather booths, and chandeliers hanging above each table. They had live music by a piano player and later there was a lounge style act while we ate. It really was entertaining rather than distracting, and the music was mostly love songs. Being that it was our anniversary we even got up and danced - I didn't expect this at dinner!

The menu looked good but we ended up ordering both specials for the evening: Filet mignon and halibut with risotto.. They were fantastic! We couldn't believe the food was so good! The wine list was a little pricey, but not totally unreasonable.

The biggest surprise was the service. Our waitress was very attentive, offered suggestions, gave us tastings of the wines we were debating about and was not at all put off when she found out we had a Groupon.

A man came around selling roses, which I think could be annoying if you're not with a date, but for us it was an added feature for an anniversary meal.

We will be coming back soon, esp. because they regularly offer their Groupon. I'd highly recommend trying this place but go on a night that you're up for the entertainment.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,5,3,5,7smit34lhmaO4QIQQy7pJQ

After coming here I won't be coming back. The evening started out on a positive. Liked the idea and the decorations and atmosphere, but the food was sub par for the price. It said steakhouse so I ventured for the $40 steak. My friend had to change her order due to them being out of food and she was also not impressed with the selection. 

We did make reservations and asked about the special to make sure it was still going on when we called. We were assured it was. However, after we ate the waitress brings the bill and after inspection find out the special was not honored.  She then told us that the special was for locals only and we were clearly not locals. 

They did finally honor the discount, but not without complaint.  The waitress told me that ""next time I just need to be aware"".

Alight - so when you walk in, you're met with a closed room and a note to ring the buzzer. You do so and are surprised by someone opening a small door and getting kind of rough with you (words). I won't reveal more secrets but that should set the tone well enough. 

You walk in and they have a crooner serenading the crowd and he's good. He sounds like a classic. The whole ambiance gives off this vibe of an Italian mob speakeasy. The staff is in on it, but it's never over the top or too gimmicky. 

We sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, but that was the best spot. You get to watch the super focused cooks and chef run though orders with extreme focus and precision. A great spot for someone to gain insight into the dance and acrobatics that comes with the art of preparing food.

Then the meal came. The pasta fagioli was superb. Freshly prepared and just as light and balanced as it is supposed to be.  I ordered Uncle Pauly's arrabbiata (sans protein) and it was AMAZING! The heat, the garlic, and that authentic sauce was a wonderful balance. The penne was cooked a perfect al dante. Seriously, so many places get it too soft, but these pros know how to do it.

I went to order an item I saw off the online menu and the waitress told me they took that item off the menu 8 years ago. Really? They couldn't update their menu. It would take 5 minutes. I settled for the lasagna and I would say stouffer's is better. Our bill came to $103. My cocktail the size of a shot was $10. They charge strip prices with a Denny's quality type of food.

I won't ruin it. After we got in, we got seated. We sat in the main room across from the singer. I don't know what his name is, but he's a wonderful singer. He sings Frank Sinatra hits. And, I think a couple others. (I tipped him five dollars and he was very happy.)

We started off with the stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty good and a little spicy. We also got some lightly toasted bread with butter. I really loved my Tiramisu martini. For my second martini, an orange Creamsicle was recommended. But, I did not like it at all. Luckily for me, the waitress took it away and brought me a 2nd Tiramisu martini. (It tastes just like the dessert!) 

For the entrées, I got the ""wise guy"" Alfredo with shrimp and he got the New York steak with pasta on the side. The steak was surprisingly delicious. Capo's is a steakhouse in addition to Italian food. The Alfredo sauce was perfect. It was creamy and it wasn't too greasy like sometimes Alfredo can be. Plus, we did ask for Parmesan cheese. They don't grate it at the table for you, but I do believe that it is freshly grated every day. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu. It was very delicious. Overall, it is a really entertaining and wonderful restaurant.

My second visit was just as wonderful. We didn't have a reservation, so we couldn't get a table. But, we sat at the bar and it was very pleasant. Again, this is a very romantic place, perfect for a date night. We had a wonderful drinks raging from Tiramisu martini, white Russian and he just had Whiskey and Coke. For the two appetizers, we chose calamari and the giant meatballs. The meatballs were extremely delicious... very flavorful and just perfect. And, there was so much of them, that I took the leftovers to go and they tasted just as good in the morning warmed up in the oven!

Since I'm from Michigan, I heavily rely on my co-workers from California who know of the hot spots to go to for SEMA, and I just usually go where they tell me to go.   

However, when you drive 20 minutes off of the strip, and you're across the street from an Infinity dealership at a place that looks like it could have been a closed down dive bar?   You honestly start questioning yourself... 

We arrived with our group and walked in the front door... and went through the fun process of getting into a speakeasy.   I won't give details... I'll leave it for someone else.  But we walked in and it completely took the expectations of the outside and put it to shame.   A place that was greatly decorated, live music, lively bartenders, and people all willing to help you find something that you're looking for.   

But as our group was seated, the waitresses grabbed our drink orders, and we were told about what Capo's was known for.   We ordered some capped mushrooms, meatballs, and garlic bread.    Our nibbles were fantastic.   The meatballs that we were told about were just what they explained them to be... absolutely amazing.  Spicy yet satisfying.   

Our main courses were also great.   There was a large variety of dishes that were ordered since it was a larger group, but all I could hear were the rave reviews for their ribeye steak, chicken alfredo, chicken piccata, and veal.  

I could have rolled myself out of the place if I wanted to, however I didn't want to push it... the food was so good I wanted to enjoy the food and possibly take some back to the hotel.    However, there was no more left when I looked down at my plate.  

Also, I have rarely ever needed to say that there was too much alcohol in my drink... but their take on a Long Island.... was out of this world.   I had one, and then the 2nd one was just way over the top.

The host graciously sat us but warned us we were sitting near the kitchen so it might be loud. Male vocalist (lovely voice) was singing Sinatra and my husband kept telling me it was a recording of Sinatra and not live. It wasn't until the end of dinner that he believed me!

Our server had an Italian mafioso accent and he was very attentive. I had the pasta fagioli; it was very flavorful and more broth-like rather than thick which is what I prefer. Also tried the ""Angels with a dirty face"" which is angel hair pasta with prosciutto, peas & mushrooms in a pink sauce (mixing the Alfredo with a red sauce?).  It was perfect as was my husband's Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was so tender he didn't need a knife. He also added a meatball (huge and delicious).

We wanted to have lunch, and when we drove up, saw it was 2-for-Tuesday.  Great start so far.  Walked around, took photos, and went to enter.  Pushed the button, and sure enough, a young guy slides open the ""visual door"", and tells us to ""get in here"".  Wall/door swings open, and our senses are indulged with the ambiance.  Speaking of ambiance, there is no one word to describe Capo's.  You say something about the food, you miss the atmosphere.  You say about the atmosphere, you miss the employees.  You get the idea.

We are seated in a booth, and the darkness of the place just exudes speak-easy.  The smells from the kitchen tell us we chose wisely.  When our waiter arrives, we ask about the 2-for, and he tells us that is't $20 off the second entree for dinner.  Lunch now?  We decide to see the dinner menu, and that was the right decision.  Each menu had a little flashlight attached to it, as yes, it is that dark.  We order, then sit back and soak in the feel.  

I had to use the facilities, and when I returned, the guy that gave directions was also the singer.  Very friendly/talkative, and when I told him it was our anniversary (celebrating a bit late), he offered to sing a song or 2 for us.  That was very special.  The song?  ""Unforgettable"".

Food arrives, and our taste buds could not wait.  Wife had the ravioli, and I the spaghetti with veggie ball.  One bite, and we are in love with Capo's.  You know when you read/hear/watch a review, and you think that might work?  MFF was so far off........  it was that good.  NO, it was that excellent!!!  The cheese in wife's ravioli melted in her mouth, it was so smooth.  Was my meatball really veggie?  There was a heft to it that was never experienced before.  I don't know if they put something extra in it, as I was on gastro-relaxation for the next few hours.

And......  another song for us before we left.

The food was the best from my trip! There was a magician walking around from table to table blowing minds! While they had a frank Sinatra impersonator tearing up the microphone.

What an experience, when you first walk in the super cool entrance and then the ambience of the mobster feel is spot on. Extremely poorly lit and that's the point so I thought that was kind of neat (especially that they were smart enough to put a little light on each menu). The food though is absolutely to die for! The waitress was super nice to me and my date and her suggestions were perfect. I've never had a meatball that amazing and those noodles were so perfectly cooked it was almost scary. They even had a Sinatra singer in there (though the music was a bit loud by him) who was actually really great. All around not a single complaint! Oh and it was 2 for 1 Tuesday so we got $20 off (that was almost my entire entree, $22)! Fantastic, just fantastic.",8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q,0,0,5,ypgdH0PuTMPJlTudsgZ7AA

Went out for dinner but got more.   The food, traditional Italian, was excellent.  Our party of three had Lasagna, Chicken Parmesan, and Scaloppini and each dish was excellent.  The service was outstanding and our waiter had a pleasant personality.  The Stuffed Mushroom appetizer was also fantastic.

In addition to the great food, we were entertained by a Sinatra style singer and when he took a break the background music was out of the Bronx Tale - just fantastic atmosphere.  We were also entertained by a magician at our table while we waited for our meal.  The feel of old Vegas is here and alive.

5912912,2017-12-12,1,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"Decent food. Music is WAY TOO LOUD. Horrible service. The gimmick isn't worth the time. Go someplace else.

First, as we pulled into the parking lot, there were lots of cop cars and an ambulance. Apparently someone tried breaking in the back with a butcher knife and attacked the cooks. Not a nice neighborhood. The mob and gangster theme can only go so far before the violence is real.

Next, we made a reservation here because we cancelled one at Herbs and Rye (amazing place) so we could take some friends to Capo's because it has a reputation of a cute fun place. Wrong. We ordered a round of drinks, ordered all of our food and an appetizer. Got the drinks, got the appetizer, then 15-20 minutes later without seeing our server with no refills on drinks and table cleared, we still hadn't gotten our salads. Two tables came and sat during our appetizer that now had their salads and meals. I spoke to the manager who blamed the kitchen issue, even though the server never came to check on us or refill drinks.

They brought us a ""round on the house"" and said our meals (now at almost an hour late), were next. That was a lie. Salads and second round of drinks were gone, a third table that came in after us received their entrees, and we were still sitting there. The manager came over and said he was comping the meal. Fine, we will wait for the entrees at this point, (one hour and 20 minutes).

Entrees arrived. Food was good, which is a shame that the service was so horrible. Risotto was great, all dishes were flavorful and good portion, but overpriced.

The bill arrived, and they just gave a small discount. Not comped. I told the server that the manager told us it was being comped. Manager came back over and said we misunderstood him, that ""comped"" was only a portion, not actually comped. So we ended up paying for that ""round of drinks on the house"" along with food that was clearly forgotten.

The thing this server and manager didn't know is that not only was our table of 4 all experienced restaurant workers, a manager, and a chef, but making the excuse of the ""hood system"" going down in the kitchen when 3 other tables got the entrees and were almost done by the time we got ours is just a disrespectful lie instead of just saying the server forgot to put our order in. At least honesty would be respectful. A full comp should have been the least they could have done with this debacle, but to lie and make excuses? Uncalled for. 

Overpriced. Decent food. Music is WAY TOO LOUD. Horrible service. The gimmick isn't worth the time. Go someplace else.",ogjYrsxTTqJXQelbWMs3QA,0,0,1,gqrv42E50riNgZy3Sg0sXw

5946202,2013-07-15,0,q3dJQtwZQrrurNT-1bNKgQ,"My boyfriend described this place in three words 'unique but bland', and that is the perfect way to describe this establishment. 

Atmosphere - You enter through the back door into a small room where there is a door bell, you ring the bell and the window opens... They asked us who we were and we gave them our reservation, and then they asked us if we had any weapons (That was a bit overkill) and then they let us enter in through another door to the restaurant. It was very dark inside, so dark inside the menus have little lights in them. There was also a guy who sang and when round to all the tables. He was rather irritating... Ignore him and he'll leave. And he totally put his own money in his tip jar when he set up!

Service - Our server was very attentive and despite other reviews I read that said they are rude when you have a groupon, we used a groupon and they were great.

Food - BORING. I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp... There weren't even croutons on it... And that was the only green salad on the menu. My boyfriend had a pasta dish. It was average. They did do a good job with the dirty martini and the blue cheese olives

Overall, I am happy I purchased the groupon and checked it out... But I would not pay full price for it. They tried... but the food, no thanks.",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,4,1,3,dbXv6-koupp8pTgGbMO11Q

My rating isn't based on the food it is based on the distinct feeling small children aren't ""very"" welcome. Firstly while many people find the ""faux mob"" motif part of the ambience I found it quirky. From having a small window opened to the ""mob whisper"" host. This is their ""thing"" and judging from reviews it is well received so this is MY problem not theirs. My issue was actually that we went late afternoon/early evening with our 3 year old and 7 month old. We were sat by a side door-which was opened a couple of times letting broad daylight into an otherwise very dark restaurant. We definitely were sat ""out of the way"" of everyone-that is the feeling I got. Our server was decent-not great, service was decent. What my rating is really down to is they clearly wanted us out before the ""dinner crowd"" really started and it was painfully obvious. I was a waitress in college so I know about rushing people out/turning the ""four top"" etc and this was definitely the feeling I got. I think an all adult party who liked the ""faux mob"" motif would be received better and quite like this restaurant.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,3,4xu40s5Lj5T36eg4tpClkA

We arrived and went through the secret entrance. i don''t want to spoil it for future patrons, but be prepared to be surprised and be careful where you stand. The host brought us in to a very dimly lit restaurant. it took my eyes a minute to adjust. The feel inside is very old school, mobster atmosphere with the big, vinyl padded booths. Our server was a young lady with tatts and she was very impressive. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks (wine in particular). She prompted us on things like the size of the meatballs which are half a lb so be careful with how many you order. They are their famous meatballs. I didn't order it but everyone in the party that did was blown away. I had the grilled chicken carbonara and it was so scrumptious. There was no negative feedback from anyone, only praises on the food and how good it was and how big the serving was for lunch. 

Our server was very attentive and so were the rest of the staff. They asked if we wanted refills as soon as they saw the glass was at halfway.
