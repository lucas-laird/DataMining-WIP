279909,2010-07-26,0,KPLFg6jWMXmRv5Dh1TKG6A,"I lived in NYC for a few years, but never found pizza as good as this.  We loved Lombardi's there on Spring Street, but this topped it.  Was in Vegas with my family.  Needed a late dinner and wanted to get off the strip (also wanted to save a few bucks).  Ended up going towards the Town Center and thought this would be a good choice as we'd already been to the other chains there.  For the four of us we shared a salad.  Very fresh and great dressing.  The other three got pepperoni, olive and peppers on a large.  What a ton of pizza!  I (the weirdo vegan) got a small pizza without cheese with mushrooms and hot peppers.  Vegas isn't very veg friendly, so this was an absolute delight for me.  Very crispy crust, delicious sauce, and the peppers were so unique and delicious.  The fam loved their pizza, too.  We had plenty of leftovers and the bill was only $50 for the whole table...cost the same as our breakfast at the Mandalay Bay restaurant.  Highly recommended!  Service was fantastic, too.",kmJXIbQ8IhYtzytfO377PQ,0,0,5,cBcgrDb8XE0UxFqfMK-Kqw

How do you screw up a cheese pizza?I guess they know how?Burnt pizza with no flavor is not my thing.If I wanted to eat charcoal I would've ate a bag of Kingston briquettes.

684734,2009-08-24,0,KPLFg6jWMXmRv5Dh1TKG6A,"If you want great coal fired pizza go to Grimaldis on Eastern. So maybe I'm biased because I was a fan of Grimaldis  but I went to Anthony's as a birthday event with a friend.  I was excited for it as I love the thin crispy crust of coal oven pizza. It is in Town Square which is ok but parking is a nightmare sometimes. The inside is nice and large. The wait staff is real nice.  They don't have fountain drinks? So you get a bottle at a time. That sucks. If I'm going to have to pay by the bottle then I'm going to drink beer. They only have a house salad or tomato and mozzarella, no ceasar. I'm a ceasar fan but I figured I'd enjoy the house if it's the only one it should be good right? Not really.  It was, maah ok at best and only ok because I got the Gorgonzola to top it with. The pizza toppings are about the same as Grimaldis as far as limitations but I don't mind as long as it's good. We got a meatball pizza, a white pizza, a tomato spinach pizza, and a pepperoni pizza. Yeah we tried a lot but it was a party.  The pizzas came out nice and hot but the crust is a bit more chewy and the mozz on the pizza didn't seem to be as fresh as I'd hoped for. So, I say if you're in Town square and want pizza (you must like thin crust) go to Anthonys over California Industrial Mass Produced Pizza Kitchen anytime but if you want great New York style coal fired thin crust check out Grimaldis.   Grimaldis crust is less chewy and their toppings seem to be of higher quality.",llx3GcUeFzxTw9vxfzvSqw,3,0,3,5VtT0LadBLOZHOvwneGlqA

I made the mistake of going to New York over the previous weekend but for Las Vegas pizza this is one of the best.

1138683,2009-08-26,1,KPLFg6jWMXmRv5Dh1TKG6A,"A little competition for Grimaldi's .  Not the best location within Town Square but ok by me.

We started with  ""coal roasted""  chicken wings with grilled onions and foccacia - unusual combination - i liked it, the gf didn't - ""too many burnt parts ""  i kinda like a nibble of  charred flesh .

Ask about beer selection, the server goes down the list - not impressed, order a corona.  Later i hear another server going down the list and i hear moretti and peroni - that pissed me off cuz i like the 'ol moretti bottle (beer is ok to ) - that old guy sippin' on a big 'ol mug of beer - that's gonna be me someday !

Anyways, gf gets a small specialty pizza - mozzarela, sliced tomato and basil - decent  but the tomatoes didn't wow me.  

I went with the basic sausage - for $14 i think they could've spared a few more sausage crumbs , but overall, not bad.  With a California pizza kitchen in the Square, Anthony's having a limited menu and Lord only knws what they are paying in rent !

My pizza had burnt edges, which they said was normal for coal fired pizza, but it left this bitter taste that I did not care for.  Also, I ordered onions on my pizza, which came out caramelized.  Some people may like that, but the sweetened taste I felt didn't fit in with the rest of the pizza.  Overall, I might come here again out of convenience when I am at Town Square, but the other reviews are right on -- Grimaldi's is much better.",jodPtzKf6CrxxlubsFyyIQ,0,0,3,KgVPHxghnKMLVjhOZh1IPw

I had a terrible server early one night, but have found a few regulars on the wait staff that are always helpful.  Every time, management comes around to make sure everything is going well.  Only negative I can say about Anthony's that makes it not get that 5th star is that there is nothing on tap; all beers and sodas are bottled.  For a soda drinker this is a good deal, but the pizza far outweighs any negative feelings I have.",jh8m8ubfDHfUH_4SAOvzXA,1,0,4,FkSy6lyWfy3AiG_gqlWSyw

Quick and friendly service.  Started with an Anthony's Italian Lunch Salad, which in my opinion was big enough for two.  All ingredients tasted fresh and crisp, and were served with warm triangles of foccacia bread.  My BF and I shared a small pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  As they say, it's well-done...nice and crunchy, saucy and cheesy, and warm right out of the oven.  Definitely satisfied my pizza craving!  The only downside to the experience was that my BF had a mad craving for cheesecake and this place was out of it!  It's the only dessert they offer and they had none.  Aside from that, everything was yummy.  We wouldn't hesitate to go back there again next time we're in Vegas...but hopefully they'll have cheesecake!",M5iHl64Mysu6q34zMBdi6g,0,0,4,4pHKUF-fYCgyX2xDh2k_yg

got there at 12:30 on a tuesday for lunch and it was pretty empty, only 3 tables in the place, so there was no vibe at all, just staff standing around!  service was attentive and quick. no fresh brew iced tea!!! WTF!!!!
we started with the baked chicken wings, and they were GREAT.  i wish there was some sauce with them but, they had great flavor from being roasted at high heat with lots of fresh herbs.
we got the paul & jon young pizza (???)  had meatballs, sausage and sweet peppers with ricotta cheese.  it was not good. the toppings were mediochre, and the crust was bad. tasted like something you can buy from the grocery freezer case and bake at home. very disappointed by that pizza.
i plan to go back, BUT  it will be for a salad and some more of those awesome chicken wings, sure as hell not the pizza!!!!
45 bucks for 2 for lunch, tip included (got the large pie should of gotten small or none at all!!)",lm3uz31GvKyMQKqAilBkoA,0,0,2,GXKr4kRyc9FFm807Ii6njQ

3514868,2009-07-13,0,KPLFg6jWMXmRv5Dh1TKG6A,"Had dinner here on a Sunday night. It's a small restaurant in Town Square. The place wasn't busy at all so it took no time to get seated. Our waitress was very friendly and almost too attentive (stopping by every 5 minutes almost). Their menu is pretty limited and they specialize in coal fired pizza (who would have guessed). There are signs all over the restaurant that will let you know that your pizza will be ""well done"" -- meaning the bottom may look a little black and burnt but the top will be perfect.  And, that's exactly how it came out. The crust was thin and crunchy and the top was a little too greasy but that was from all the pepperoni. It tasted really good and the salad we had was also good -- nothing spectacular but still solid. The pizzas are more traditional than what you would find at places like CPK or Sammy's (""gourmet"" pies) so it was a nice change of pace to get something old school like that without having to go to a crappy pizza place like pizza hut or domino's. There is no kid's menu, but that didn't really matter since we all shared one pizza. I was disappointed with the beers they had (didn't feel like drinking corona or heinekin) but their wine was surprisingly good (got the malbec). This place is definitely worth a visit and we'll probably be back.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,0,0,3,881tUg2LUYhqY84edhRwlw

Our favorite dishes are the Paul & Young Ron Pizza (Meatballs, Sausage, Hot Pepper, and Ricotta Cheese)....we also like to make our own.  For an appetizer we split the Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato Salad....which comes with marinated sweet peppers...we add a little oil/vinegar and it makes for a nice appetizer.

I have gone on my lunch hour and been late back to work. On my second visit, every table around me got served before my pizza came, even though I was the first table seated.  I am assuming something went wrong with my order but the server didn't feel the need to tell me.  While I was waiting, the host staff couldn't be more bored and was talking loudly at the front of the restaurant.

As for the food, someone needs to tell the cook that coal fired pizza doesn't mean burned pizza. A layer of soot on the bottom of my pizza isn't artisan cooking, it's a clear sign the equipment is not be used properly. I do not think I will give this place a third try.",QYV4RBt7nIWoALwFT0uL3w,2,0,2,Vzpe20umpkSiZ3ihAKC5Rg

5057839,2010-01-26,0,KPLFg6jWMXmRv5Dh1TKG6A,"I'm taking the star ratings very literally on this one: Anthony's is A-OK (3) but I'm not quite sure ""I'm a fan"" (4). The thing is this:  I'm an East Coaster.  I know I'm never going to truly get East Coast pizza in Las Vegas, anywhere. That's just the way it is. 

Having said that, Anthony's is very close to some of the best pizza I've had here, and they get at least a B++ for effort, starting with the young-John-Turturro lookalike waiter. 

The menu is simple here--only 9 classic toppings. I think they could do slightly better on that count, though I can understand why they don't offer things like pineapple. The crust is charcoal charred but still soft.
Paul & Young Ron, which is a meat and veg combo, needs a fork and knife...that would be the default choice here.

I was impressed most by the caprese salad-tomatoes, mozerella, basil and (in their version) roasted peppers. The quality of ingredients was as good in this simple dish as some of the finest italian places on the Strip. That says a lot about their dedication here. 

They have Peroni and Moretti beer, what you should be drinking with pizza (if not one of the decent wines by the glass)

""Turturro"" tells me they get their biscotti from a relative's bakery in Brooklyn. I'm not a biscotti guy, so I don't try them, but I appreciate the effort.

It's a bit hard to find in Town Square, but definitely one of the better dining options there in the price range.",97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ,2,2,3,n5XMvo3O1ViFkx9SYbvSXg
5063876,2010-03-11,0,KPLFg6jWMXmRv5Dh1TKG6A,"This past weekend was my first visit to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza, and I hate to say it would be my last time as well.  But before you start slamming me for my two measly stars, allow me to break it down for you.

First, the establishment is clean, comfortable, friendly, and rich with tasty old world nostalgia.  We had the same ""Turturro-esq"" waiter that E.C. G. had (lol!) who greeted us with a (somewhat) authentic east-side accent.  Service was prompt and not over-bearing at all.  One star.

Now, it has always been my experience that whenever the word ""pie"" is used to describe a pizza, it was a dining pleasure.  This left me hopeful for a delectable dining experience here at Anthony's; my girl and I decided on sharing a meatball and ricotta pie.

It took a bit to get out to the table, which is normal for most custom cooked pies from any reputable establishment.  However, when it came out to us and I took a bite, it didn't quite send my tastebuds into orgasmic excitement as I anticipated.  I expected the meatballs to be hearty and savory with spicy abundance to offset and complement the otherwise drab ricotta.  It must have been on vacation or off the clock on this evening.

A friend ordered this dish called ""Eggplant Marino"", which was supposedly named after Dan Marino's favorite dish.  Now THAT dish was good and pleased my 'buds wonderfully.  So I highly suggest ordering this for your eggplant lovers out there!  Here's the second star.

Overall, I left the restaurant somewhat disappointed that pie's were their specialty.  My feeling is that if you claim something in your establishment's name, it better damn well deliver the goods.  Perhaps they should change the name to ""Anthony's Better Dish Is Eggplant Marino"".

Two stars is pushing it for me, but I'm in a nice mood today.  Thanks for reading!",1jw1ZHzNxGOj8LWH9K61EQ,0,0,2,sXlmswcjYbAN9kCuxadFog

The rosemary, oil, the burnt ends, grilled onions, the juicyness of the wings altogether is magnificent.

I'm really big on making sure there's nothing left on the bone and I love chewing on the cartilage with the hint of the coal/burnt taste.  Plus they put some flatbread underneath all the wings which soaks up a lot of the flavor and chicken juice.  Goes great with beer!

Mike thoroughly enjoyed the multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting the football game. We split a small specialty pizza- 1/2 meatball & ricotta, 1/2 white. The pizza was sort of bland and their signature burnt crust really wasn't my bag, especially since I'm a crust girl.
