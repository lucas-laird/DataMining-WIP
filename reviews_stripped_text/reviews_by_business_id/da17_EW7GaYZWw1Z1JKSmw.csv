They are often busy especially on the weekends and mornings but their slow periods you wind up waiting an hour to get served plus another 15 minutes waiting on your server so you can ask for the check which you almost always have to ask to get (I would often give up and just go to the register and tell them what I had). I know it's not just me, I've seen multiple times whole tables of people just get up and leave without ever getting a hint of service after they are seated. To be fair they do have a couple good servers there that really do an outstanding job but on balance I've had to give up going here, I just don't have that kind of patience for the interminable waits to get basic service even when they are not busy.",94vfvg8_VMsnejeUe2B5bg,0,0,2,4D5iKhOV3rQRAN9zVZWgzA

790360,2015-01-10,0,da17_EW7GaYZWw1Z1JKSmw,"Worst Dennys experience I've had. I'm usually a fan of the decently priced restaurant that has a menu of items that a person could easily make at home but are too lazy, too drunk, or traveling to make. I just placed an order to go and walked the short block down the strip to pick it up. Their credit card systems make tipping awkward cause they ask if you would like to tip instead of letting you discretely fill it out yourself. I declined to tip on the card because I was going to tip in cash. After that service tanked. I decided to not tip after this, got my food and walked past the group of employees who seemed to be chain smoking right outside of the door. Walked back to the shop I worked at and found out that only one out of three orders was right. I walked back to get it fixed but the second trip wasn't any better. There was still a gauntlet of Dennys name tag wearing chainsmokers to walk through to get inside. Nothing but negative attitudes awaited when I stepped in the door. I gave the food to the lady that just separated herself from the smoking excursion outside and let her know that we were missing items off the order and what we did get was lacking in accuracy of what our stomachs wanted. She grabbed the bag of mistakes and ran them into the kitchen, then power walked briskly passed me as though on a quest through middle earth. I later found out she was on an adventure to rejoin the ranks of tobacco enthusiasts outside, as there were people unnecessarily and patiently waiting to start their very own dining excursion, and to hand over somefuture hard earned dollars while attempting desperate this place themselves. I departed through the clouds of tobacco dependency and set myself going south towards my place of business. Got back to familiar surroundings and yet again found that the order wasn't what my digestive tract was craving. Then a feeling of regret hit me with a flashback of wanting to secure the accuracy of the goods that the whole adventure was based upon but instead decided to retreat. This narrative, though laced with colorful adjectives, is a work of nonfiction. But really the service was horrible and the food was under the low standard I usually hold Dennys to. I figured that the homeless that loiter infront of the business would create a problem for management but I hardly noticed them while weaving myself through the employee smoking area right outside of the main entrance.

- Service. The water refills were few and far between. Hello? We're in the DESERT, and have most likely been drinking beer/alcohol all day. We need water, and lots of it. If you don't want to keep coming over to refill us, please just leave a pitcher on the table!

- Music. I can't even fully describe the weird 80's jazz stuff they had on, but I will say it was too loud, and too annoying.

1.  We walk in and this ex-army style woman took down our name, and was like so commanding and loud and I just started cracking up from her.

2.  I didn't realize that EVERYONE in Vegas goes to this Denny's for breakfast.

3.  Half the people are so drunk from last night they think they're going to dinner.

4.  We get seated, and I order an iced coffee with no sugar, that came back with ""extra sugar"".  Next time listen guy.

5.  *I look around seeing all the hungover people of Las Vegas, once more*

6.  The food was surprisingly amazing.... Giggle to that as well.  I had a breakfast burrito, with egg, bacon, avocado, and tomatoes.  It was really really good, i was so surprised.  

7.  The waiter didn't like me when i sent back the coffee, and then asked him to give me a straw for the second coffee, without sugar this time.

8.  When I asked if their was free refills, the waiter said ""DUH"".  I started cracking up in his face.

9.  For three, the cost of breakfast was like $30, which is just a tad more than the price of coffee and a bagel in Manhattan. LOL

10.  We were sitting at our table for 30 minutes after we had finished our food, because the waiter didn't tell us that you pay at a separate cash register.  We were waiting for him to come back, it was just hilarious.

I'll start with the 15 minute wait to get seated while astonishingly bored and uncaring employees strolled back and forth. Once in a while someone would look disinterestedly at us and hold a finger up, ostensibly to say ""one more minute"", even as the bulk of the restaurant was relatively empty.

Then there is, of course, the clientele. I mean, it's the north end of the strip, so yeah... There are families with 17 kids and awkward old men with hookers. That's fine, it's Vegas, but when you're agitated as it is, this kind of stuff doesn't help.

Oh, the service. We had Mr. ""I seriously don't give a shit that you're here. What do you want to eat?"" as our waiter.

After ordering, I got up to go into the bathroom. THE BATHROOM WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.

I can't make this up, Yelp friends. The bathroom looked like a murder scene. There was blood sprayed all over the floor, the mirror, the sinks, the counter, and the paper towel dispenser. Fresh blood. After that, it may as well have been my appetite that got butchered in there.

I told the staff about the blood and the manager at least looked concerned, in the ""oh my, what else do I have to deal with tonight"" sense. They scurried off to figure out what happened. 

I got my food, and it was served on a dirty plate. The final straw. This place is a fucking shithole. Go to the other Denny's, go to Walgreen's next door and buy Doritos for dinner, or even better, go to The Peppermill that's a hundred feet away, it's way, WAY better for the same price.",PIM9LfrgvCqOoOPBdJAcNg,7,0,1,LMNfIfOcv4Gl92agOqF5mg

This location is at the end of the Strip near Stratosphere between a Walgreens and a 7-11. 
The food was good and so was the service. It's average food at cheap prices. My only big complaint was unwashed silverware in my napkin... seriously. It was very disgusting. It wasn't like dried on crusty food, it was honestly dirty silverware. I was the only one. It could have been the people that sat there before me playing a prank, quite honestly. 

I got an omelet and it was very good. I asked for extra salsa and wasn't charged for it (score). 
My other dining companions got items of the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu (it's a pretty good menu) such as a cheese quesadilla for $2 and AYCE pancakes for $4. 

Everyone was please with their meal. Again nothing mind blowing, but average with good friendly service. Also, since it's Vegas, and hot, they sell Dasani bottles of water for $1 to take with you on your trek. I thought that was pretty cool.

We popped in at a not-so-prime time (there were probaby only 5 other tables filled in the whole place) and our waiter failed to deliver prompt refills - one of us made it through the whole meal with no refill.  Food came out pretty quick, but even though I expected everything to be cooked into one greasy mess, the GrandSlam-wiches had a hint of some kind of cinnamon ingredient that, according to the menu, should not have been there.

Add on the Kenny G and Michael McDonald on the radio the whole time and it was a complete buzz kill.  Sorry Las Vegas Denny's.  But I expected more/average.",5CsmkvFd97399t1WyweG-w,0,0,2,b4z7a15AEZ40mc-O2tYOBQ

When my mom and I arrived, there were not very many people inside, no one at the front to seat us, and a man sitting that had been waiting.  We wondered and the lady at the cashier finally said something.  

We had two male waiters.  One I think was in training, who did a better job than the vet.  Whenever we needed something, we asked the trainee because our other waiter never brought out what we asked for.  He didn't have many tables either, because there wasn't a lot of people in there.  

I saw a picture of nachos on the menu and it looked really good, so I ordered that.  When it came out, the only thing on the plate was chips, cheese and the avocado I ordered as extra. I asked for some salsa to give it more taste, and that made it better.  My mom stated her food wasn't that good as usual.  

The place seemed older, but obviously with their location, they have a ton of people coming in and out all hours of the day.  To keep it shiny would be difficult.  There were food particles in our booth.

I will go back to Denny's, but not this one in the heart of the strip.  I will stick to the one's closer to my home.",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,1,1,2,W-CZPLJJnU28sho0ANcTjA

2 pancakes - better than I have ever had at any other Denny's.

But that's it, eggs were overlooked and replaced with over cooked scrambled

Bacon scraps that were over  and left overs from yesterday

Sausage overlooked and old.

Red skin potatoes were not even roasted they were deep fried a little. No taste at all but grease

Toast was cold and the butter on the bread did not even melt completely because it was cold as we'll 

Ham slice was barely cooked as we'll

Of course no one comes so we go to leave and on our way out we speak to the oriental lady at the counter and tell her what happened and she could care less so then we ask for the manager.  He comes out and could give a care less too.  He took his time to come out and had nothing to say about our complaints. No sorry?? Really???  No offer for us to sit back down and get service??

Pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon strips. Well done. Fast forward 45 minutes later still no food. The waitress checked in and said food would be shortly. At this point we're now really tired and beginning to lose our appetite. Food finally comes out about 5 minutes later. All my friends get their food except for me.

then they gave everyone a menu but me.

guess they cant count.
