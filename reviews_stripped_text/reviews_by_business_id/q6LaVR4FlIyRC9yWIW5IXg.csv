146135,2010-12-31,0,q6LaVR4FlIyRC9yWIW5IXg,Went in here not expecting much since this Jewish deli is located in a food court. I kept looking to see if they microwaved the pastrami (feh!) instead of steaming it. But the garlicky aromas wafting through the restaurant were not deceiving. The pastrami and matzo ball soup were actually really good! I couldn't find any microwave. I'll come here again after my next gondola ride!,rd1kcbcis6EfEBGMOnsGtg,2,1,4,_s5-1Rnpiu4efl--thuW9Q

""Quick, because there was no line, and not a sit down place, but the service was excrutiatingly slow.  By the time I finally paid for my food and left, I was exhausted.  The cashier did not really know what he was doing, and the guy making my sandwich ended up being the cashier too.  Even though I asked specifically for no onions on my Turkey toaster sandwich, it came with a stack of onions.  No big deal though because they were easy enough to remove from the sandwich.  The matzo ball soup is not the best matzo ball soup I have eaten, but at $3.50, I can't complain.",5RnK76PTa0bzjL9RBGa9gg,0,0,3,rMNDoC6kDa90SI61-AJkJg

The decor is very cute. Walls lined with shelves filled with cans of matzo ball soup, gefelte fish, etc. Old school Pepsi ads on the walls. I've never been to a real NYC deli, but I thought the decor was a nice touch.

Food was decent for the price. My sandwich was a little bland for something so full of Italian meaty goodness. Boyfriend's pastrami was pretty good though.

Only real complaint? Had to remind the lady making my sandwich to leave off the Romaine.",obukhI570ZqM2kSvNoqtlw,0,0,3,1Li-ZGTo9S59ym1bwDwWIQ

I had the  New Yorker, which had pastrami, turkey, brisket with slaw and thousand island and a small pickle on the side.  Runs about $9. It was a triple decker sandwhich, piled high with meat.   It was delicious.  It was warm, moist and flavorful, and the pastrami was not salty.   It was the best sandwich I ever ate.  I  was stuffed.  It was so good, we decided to visit again later in the week for a late night snack.  The price was decent considering its inside a casino.  We wanted to grab a sandwich for the early drive home but unfortunate for us, they didn't open till 10a.m.  We will make a point to stop by Towers Deli whenever we are in Vegas.

The first time we came, the cashier was super nice.  We asked for cups of water and he gave us free bottled waters!  The second time we came, we had a horrible experience!  The cashier was super rude.  We thought the water would be free like the previous day, but it was like $2.50, so we said no thanks to the water.  The lady was super annoyed and rude at the fact that we didn't want the waters.  We then had to wait for the manager to come and remove the waters from the tab, which took forever!  3 stars for the sandwich, but I had to take away a star for the rude cashier and the wait.",cm1hbe8hZLWtY5FN1Ztsrw,1,0,2,xZ5NPemCTCE8uczo3aWXSg

I wasn't all that hungry so I just ordered a sesame bagel w/lox and cream cheese. They give you some tomato slices and lettuce and a lot of salmon.

1592611,2010-12-12,2,q6LaVR4FlIyRC9yWIW5IXg,"I went here for a quick bite before watching Phantom of the Opera. There was plenty of sandwich choices that made it hard for me to decide which one I wanted. In the end, i chose the ""New York Sky-High,"" which had its own poster plastered on the glass window! (duh, obvious choice?!)

You get to choose the type of  sandwich bread you want (white, whole grain..toasted, not toasted..etc); comes with a generous amount of hot pastrami (well seasoned-salted/peppered), layers of cold turkey meat, creamy cold slaw, and tangy Thousand Island dressing. The combination of the whole sandwich was divine! I still dream about it till today! The sandwich was very generous with its meats (piled up so high!) that when I bite into it, it gets all over my checks (annoying, but yet so worth it!!) The sandwich was salty, creamy, light, cold, hot, tangy..ugh, so good!!! 

This place is small and the decor is retro--similar to  Johnny's Rockets (but not as bright). The NY Sky High sandwich is $8.50. Its kind of a lot just for one sandwich (bread size is slightly bigger than Orolwheat's), but you just have to try it at least once. And for $3, you can get a fountain drink (w/ free refills).",QEQYldM0S2uvjhbjJAuH3w,2,1,5,j-WX-4DgMxT-AV7QC5zFmA

2285120,2010-01-20,0,q6LaVR4FlIyRC9yWIW5IXg,"What a find.  What a bargain, especially at The Venetian. A sandwich combo (any sandwich; chips, slaw or potato salad; large fountain drink...w/refills) for $10.95 + tax.  Add to the combo a (16 oz?) cup of chicken noodle soup or matzo ball soup for $1 more.  You get free bagel crisps with the soup.  I got the combo two times in two days. So much for the ""value"" side of the equation.

Now for the food:  it was good, fresh, and homemade-tasting.  The pastrami and turkey portions were generous but not obscene (like some NY delis at other casinos.) The NY cheesecake was the real thing and only $3.50/slice (half of what Grand Lux charges for it's Cheesecake Factory made stuff!)

2631177,2014-10-13,0,q6LaVR4FlIyRC9yWIW5IXg,"I was in that bad place that we all find ourselves in while in Vegas - hungry at 9:45pm, but not wanting a buffet or sit-down time-sink and resulting food crash before hitting the tables.  We were at The Venetian, so I figured the food court would be just the ticket.  Wife got a pizza, but I wanted something more substantial - Towers Deli looked like the spot.

I wandered in, drawn by the photos of massive sandwiches, and ordered what had to be awesome - the Italian Stallion.   Advertised as a plethora of Italian meats and cheese, with a walnut pesto spread on ciabatta, I ditched the ciabatta for rye and added spicy brown mustard - and was expecting a sandwich that lived up to its name.  That didn't happen.

What I got was a smallish looking deal, with thin layers of meat.  Frankly, I was pissed, and promptly went and ordered something else from Nathan's to supplement the meager looking sandwich.  I warned my wife that a vicious Yelp review was forthcoming, and sat down in a surly storm of indignation to eat my $11 tea sandwich.

I took a bite, fully expecting to be disappointed, when the flavors hit.

This was a fantastic-tasting sandwich.  I cannot emphasize that enough.  The meats were excellent, seriously top quality and each variety standing on its own.  If you want good deli, hit Towers Deli, but order two sandwiches if you're hungry.

Towers Deli would get 5 stars if they made a deli sandwich like NY makes a deli sandwich - tall, meaty, filling and deeply satisfying.  Towers has the quality and taste down, they just need to adjust the quantity.",127_Chp1kmIyUFn49jQEBg,0,0,3,poRIiYvt3rqe9L6I-jBwEQ

It was quite large (3 slices of bread!) so I ate one half at lunch and the other was saved for later, after some drinking at the pool. I enjoyed the sandwich (and it even tasted good after sitting around for 4-5 hours)! The sandwich itself is not going to win any foodie awards but it did the job of a fast bite to eat. I also ordered an ice tea and a bag of chips to make it a combo. Upon opening my bag of food I found that alongside the sandwich there was a small pickle and coleslaw.

At times it might seem impossible to just grab a quick, light, and fairly inexpensive meal inside these casino resorts.  But, inside the food court there are a couple options outside of the normal pizza, burgers and chinese.

Towers Deli is clean, spacious and inviting.  There are plenty of options and each sandwich is made to order, so everyone should be able to get something they like.  The prices are good, but when you compare to the other options you have I'd say they are pretty great for what you're getting.  The sandwiches are HUGE and delicious.
