723432,2017-04-30,0,JAHvhS-EDRxtoArvrpA5JQ,RUDE!! My husband and I walked in sat at the bar asked the bartender with red/orange  hair for a menu and asked her if we could eat at the bar and play video poker. She said yes and gave us a menu and then proceeded to IGNORE US!!! She walked past us a couple times and so did another employee (bald guy) . Never offered us a drink or took our order as we sat there putting money in the machines!! We are Sun City residents and will NEVER walk in there again!

The last two times we have gone to Five Star, we have sat down (menus are pre planted on the table) within view of two waitresses, and no one waited on us. We waited more than 20 minutes both times, didn't get water, a I'll be right with you, nothing. And no comment to either of us as we had to walk by them to leave. And won't go back. Our friends waited 25 minutes for pancakes on another occasion. 
It is so disappointing to not be able to frequent a local establishment, especially one that is subsidized by residents of Sun City and we can walk to.",VH5IUm0Jhk24gH4fCxXq2A,1,0,1,fISaV7vLjstz_L5adJTbdg

Our server Sophia was very attentive.  Good menu and our meals -Shrimp Tacos, Philly Ch steak sandwich, and steak and eggs were tasty! 
Happy Hour from 3-7 sounds great!  A big plus is the indoor restaurant is non- smoking !  Will definitely return",3zg47Y1liZsWcHC_r7g85g,1,0,4,k3NRoN4hDkB9FCM_WxgXdw

Solid local pub chain nestled within Sun City Summerlin overlooking Palm Valley Golf Course (it shares an entry with the Pro Shop) is this friendly little joint Mom and her pals frequent. In cooler weather, the patio is a nice place to enjoy a meal or drinks; though the restaurant is non-smoking, the patio is not. 

Prices are very reasonable for food and drinks, they do run Happy Hour specials, have those hot dog griller things, video poker at the bar, and a couple of private machines. Service has always been friendly, the bartender/server last night was a charming and cheerful fellow. 

I'm a fan of their soups, salads, burgers, and wings. Mom had the biggest chicken fingers I have ever seen last night, and though she could only tackle 1/3 last night, she is having one right now for lunch; she also enjoyed a basket of crispy fries. My Cajun Bleu burger was served bunless and medium rare as ordered, the cole slaw was tasty and not mayo logged which I appreciated. 4* meal. 

Love that we can hop in the golf cart and grab a quick bite or drink, and Mom can socialize with her posse close by in my absence.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,22,13,3,TA4NL1HOhcFAbsHzJnZJRQ
2700901,2016-10-30,3,JAHvhS-EDRxtoArvrpA5JQ,"This bar is fantastic! It's in the Desert Shores area on Del Webb and Rampart! Now tip: it looks private but it's open to anyone! If you're in Henderson and in the area, you can stop by! It has a private parking lot which comes in handy. When you come into the building, there's a gift shop to your right and the bar to your left. The bar is open 24 hours but the store isn't! They do have gambling and there is NO SMOKING. That has to be one of my favorite parts. If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, there is a whole section where you can go be sat at. Booths! You can also go and sit outside (in the back area) and there is a GORGEOUS view of the golf course. Seriously that view alone makes this place amazing. It's a gorgeous bar inside but outside is just beautiful. I have pictures of it as well that I've posted. They don't start making food till 5 am so there is a good 6 hours without food but if you have the chance, at least get their cheese steaks. They're never over cooked and perfectly seasoned! I add mayo and extra mushrooms on it. They also have monte cristos that are just delicious! If you're gambling, it kind of sucks that you don't get stuff like jack and cokes comped because Jack is a higher priced alcohol there. Their standard whiskey is fine to me though! I recommend coming here. They do have multiple locations so keep an eye out!",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,11,9,5,9IEsH2XzzrnmcJJFlXqyvA

My biggest complaint is their menu, many of the items on there menu are not available .  There the other night at 6pm and they had no onion rings or bacon for burgers as they advertised on their menu.  This is not the first time this has happened, disappointing.

They say a rewards program is coming. Been saying it for months.  Obviously this place is poorly organized. 
Happy hour is a joke.  Fifty cents to a dollar off a beer, wine or cocktail.  I asked the waitress if they comp drinks while we're playing?  She said they do.  Then after my two brews and my wife had two rum and cokes they brought me a bill.   They said they come one drink for every $20 you out in. Definitely not the kind of happy hour you get at PT's. I'll be back for the food and atmosphere but never to gamble and certainly not for the worst happy hour in town.",FTPe7VVwGDM8j9csFhShWA,2,0,3,wfmwJmfoP-OyWl2lgb_FmQ

Recently, I enjoyed two post-hiking dinners with my friend and her mother in the Five Star Tavern. It made sense that a day of hiking adventures ended with dining adventures here. Situated in the far west of the Las Vegas Valley in Sun City Summerlin, it is near Red Rock Canyon, Lone Mountain, and the Summerlin trail network. Contradictory to the striking Red Rock mountains, Five Star Tavern is inconspicuous. In Sun City Summerlin the zoning codes mandate limited use of signing. Consequently it is easy to mistake Five Star Tavern for a private golf course lounge. If it wasn't for my friend, I would of been impervious to this Tavern.

Five Star Tavern can best be described as a laid back environment. It is in a part of Las Vegas where golf carts outnumber one-armed bandits and golf courses outnumber casinos. On account of the fact that it is in close proximity to the senior citizen clubs in the adjacent Sun City Mountain Shadows Community Center, there is also a community environment. In this laid back environment, parking in the large parking lot is a breeze.

When guests walk into the Five Star Tavern, the Tavern is to the left. To the right is the golf pro shop. Straight down the hall are the restrooms then doors opening to the Palm Valley Golf Course.

The first thing that people see inside the Tavern proper is the generous wine selection. A few steps away people will see the bar, a hot dog griller, and a few gaming machines. Beyond the bar is the dining room and patio overlooking the Palm Valley Golf Course.

What is striking about the Five Star Tavern is that instead of the focus being inside, the focus is the beautiful golf course outside. This is the first Tavern that I can recall seeing an abundance of sun. The scenery is so striking that I have come up with a new category of dining. I have named this category scenic dining. Under the scenic dining model: decent to great food at a reasonable price with spectacular outdoor scenery equals a remarkable dining experience. Five Star Tavern joins Big Horn Cafe in Mount Charleston and Devine Cafe in Springs Cafe on my Scenic Dining List. Over dinner, I enjoyed watching the sundown over the Palm Valley Golf Course and seeing the geese and waterfowl in the pond. Unfortunately my friend did not share in this experience since she was facing the bar. The trick to scenic dining is to face the outdoor scenery.

Under the scenic dining model, the majestic scenery makes up for inconsistent service. This is the landscape that I would normally enjoy by sitting on a bench without a care in the world. It seemed likewise that the waitress during the August 26 visit did not have a care in the world. Well at least our table. She took our order then delivered our food then stayed at the bar. I would have to walk to the fountain to refill my glass with Coke. On the contrary, the waitress on the September 3 visit was attentive.

If the service was inconsistent both the good food and value was consistent. On August 26, I ordered the chicken parmesan with noodles. It was a hand breaded chicken breast that the cook seasoned to a golden brown texture. Red marina sauce and provolone cheese topped off the chicken parmesan that was served over pasta noodles. The noodles tasted and looked identical to spaghetti. It came with garlic bread. To compliment the $8.99 meal, I paid an additional $2 for cream of potato soup. Both the entrée and soup are a thumbs up. On September 3, I ordered fish and chips. It was made from white fish filets that was lightly fried. The fish and chips may not be the best in the world, however, they hold their own as far as taste. Ditto for the fries and cole slaw that came with it. It was worth $7.50.

If Five Star Tavern was in my part of the Valley perhaps I would visit has frequently as my friend. However, it is close to the 215-Beltway creating a charming dinner spot close to the Lake Mead Boulevard exit. Perhaps this could be an appropriate half way break between Mount Charleston and Henderson. Perhaps, I might not be back in a while. What is certain is that based on my experiences here, this is a Four Star Tavern.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,12,4,-bSxsFF1kw99dPuT-25SxA

5438818,2018-03-02,0,JAHvhS-EDRxtoArvrpA5JQ,"Worst dining experience in recent memory. I visited with one other guest for breakfast on a Wednesday. For most of our meal, we were the only guests in the restaurant. Whoever your server is should be let go or repurposed. 

After waiting an unacceptably long time for our beverages, we ordered. They're ""re-doing"" the menu, so they didn't have my first two choices. Why hand me a menu that you know is wrong without telling me? Stupid. Not considerate. 

The coffee took no joke - half an hour to refill after t was empty. They don't have real cream, just the fake palm olive oil stuff. 

Anyway, I order an omelet. No today, no potatoes. The server doesn't care, it comes about 30 minutes later with potatoes and toast because the server doesn't care. 

All in all, we spent nearly 90 minutes in an otherwise empty tavern for two omelets. Not by choice - but because that's how long it took. During that time, we were ignored more frequently than we were welcomed. 

I do not recommend this place.",sWLXpqNLhIBi_4QOPwKPog,1,0,1,9Y4qE_IkztO4uzO6AwWKGA
5674982,2017-07-10,0,JAHvhS-EDRxtoArvrpA5JQ,"Been passing this daily.  Conveniently, it is down the street and is a nice exercise walk from my home..  Open 24 hours daily!  Menu covers from breakfast until dinner with a variety of items.  Food not bad...plentiful. Been there twice..Coffee never ending and the service was good.  Second visit was for cocktails on the patio and it was lovely sitting on the patio and looking out over the golf course. Cocktails were excellent and very affordable

It is a secret place that few know about unless you live in Sun City, but it is nice to have a cocktail without going far.  It is open to all.......",qEhC8uiBMBhrLXobqyRfqA,1,1,5,NcZ7_SEDLKfuLRr6I1hQmQ
5893318,2017-04-13,1,JAHvhS-EDRxtoArvrpA5JQ,"I couldn't resist trying out this poker bar in Sun City. I had visions of a mini Rampart Casino, which turns out to be somewhat accurate (minus the smoke!). I don't think they advertise much, and it's probably difficult to stumble upon this bar unless you're golfing here or know someone in Sun City. 

The views are a big plus for this place, as it's located on the Palm Valley golf course. The bar, with gaming, has views right onto the course, and there's a patio adjacent to the bar also. They have 2 freestanding poker machines as well, if you don't want to socialize. The bar has a comfy vibe to it, and I was impressed with the wine selection. I had a pinot noir with my Monte Cristo sandwich with tater tots ($8.50) on the recommendation of the bartender. It's a very good sandwich, and the prices are reasonable.  For example, a ""dirty"" hot dog with chili is $2.99, and a regular hot dog is $1.99. 

My drinks were comped while gaming, and other than being charged $1 more than the price on the menu for my sandwich (it was changed), I have only positive things to say. The tavern is open 24 hours, and when I asked about the late night crowd, I wasn't surprised to hear that there isn't one. I recommend dropping by (it's near the shopping area with the CVS) for some reasonably priced food, great wine selection and smoke free gaming!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,5,4,4,fbeSagZpR7KXF18asB0s7A
