It literally takes an hour to an hour and a half to deliver food. Seriously. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Doesnt matter if we order at 8am, 10am or 1pm. Never fails, they take F-O-R-E-V-E-R. If you dont get what you ordered or you are upset by them delivering your breakfast around LUNCH time, be ready to have the owner talk down to you and be a total bitch to you for i dont know, just wanting what you pay for?! 

Its over priced. But its decently tasteful food. Takes forever. Owners a witch. And i'm pretty sure that they continuing forget to pack my extra ranch just to piss me off. 

End Rant. 

PS- I've never gone in there to eat because i frankly, i'd rather tip the nice delivery driver then the ignorant imbeciles that work in the dining area. 

PPS- My hot chocolate today was cold. They should call it Cold Chocolate. Or start caring if their hot chocolate is hot. One of the two would be great!",msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g,1,1,2,LWUtqzNthMM3vpWZIFBlPw

I feel like it's the brain child of a guy who decided to open a beach-themed eatery without considering the decor, the food, or the service.  Understaffed and uninspired.  Located in a strip mall off Jones and the decor inside is bland, at best.  Tables are tiny, the chairs wobble, the whole place feels super cheesy.  The service is the slowest I have ever experienced in my life, and possibly the least friendly.  The menu is very plain- just the usual egg dishes, nothing made from scratch or in house.  With so many great breakfast places in town, I am not sure why anyone would chose to eat here.  It is no cheaper than anywhere else and is nowhere near as good as Egg Works, Baby Stacks, Crepe Expectations, etc.  I like to support local businesses but this place blows.

52376,2011-10-21,0,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,"HOW in the world is this place still open? 

Never have I experienced such an awkward and uncomfortable dining experience. The rudeness and lack of customer service that was grossly displayed by the waitstaff left me with a taste in my mouth so sour that I had to write a review and warn others. 

I've tried Beach Cafe a total of three times. The first time, service was bad and the food wasn't much better. Second time, I walked in to get take out....and twenty five minutes later my sandwich was prepared. I, stupidly, decided to give this place ONE more chance (a year later) because of the close location to both my home and my work. 

My colleague and I walked in to a COMPLETELY EMPTY restaurant where we waited for a server to come to our table for SIX MINUTES. Six minutes of us awkwardly waiting in the middle of an empty dining area while the four workers, including who I assume is the manager, all talking, laughing, and gossiping along with staring at us but never making any acknowledgement towards our presence. I have managed several successful hotel and restaurant chains for over twenty years, so I understand that while customer service always comes first, with high volume and overcapacity issues, sometimes it takes a little while to get to everyone.  I have had instances where everyone of my tables was filled with people waiting around the block, and every single one of my servers made sure everyone was greeted promptly and taken care of. 

WHAT IN THE WORLD is the excuse for such behavior when there is no other customers in the place? 

I was truly baffled. 

Finally, I politely walked up and asked ""I'm sorry, do we order at the front"" to which a heavy set lady rudely responded ""uh, someone will come to you""

Alright, here we go. Finally a young lady walked over to the table and said ""what are you getting?"" 

That was her exact words. 

I need to remind you all that she was doing absolutely nothing but gossiping with the others while we waited to even order a drink. 

We ended up walking out absolutely disgusted by the lack of customer service. 

This place should be shut down and the manager running this establishment should be ashamed of herself.  I would love to contact whoever the manager is personally and explain it to them, but from the sounds of the reviews, I think I know who the manager is they're describing and considering she was one of the ""waitstaff"" that was rudely staring at us instead of being a server, I don't think the conversation would get too far.",NKKQPMNoO-G8xX6zbP5GDg,5,1,1,SdoffmHJa6Rmjk5uzGwjow

165851,2012-02-01,5,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,"Perhaps the best way to describe this place is consistent... consistently BAD. I have been in the somewhat unique, albeit unenviable, position to have sampled a large variety of their lunch items. From their fish tacos to burgers to various chicken and deli sandwiches, corn chowder, and smoothies, I have yet to discover something that is at least half-decent.

Perhaps, more specifics are in order. The fried fish had a cold, thick, and dried-out texture of cardboard. The greasy burgers were overcooked and had a soggy bun. The chicken is dry, lacking in flavor, and smothered with oily cheese. The corn chowder is a nasty gelatinous goo. The smoothies are extremely sweet and not as thick as they ought to be. You get the idea...  

Why would I continue to subject myself to such awful food? One of the facilities, where I work, will order lunch for us from various places if we are working through the lunch hour. I'm not completely sure who is responsible for picking the place each time, but there must be some kind of kickbacks taking place because I cannot fathom why they seem to keep picking this place over a vastly superior alternative like Tropical Smoothie Cafe.

One time, when they asked me what I wanted to order, I told them that I would pass. However, this woman felt really bad and insisted on suggesting something that I would like. I ended up ordering some sort of chicken sandwich which was, surprise surprise, terrible. The most recent time they ordered from here, to avoid hurting anyone's feelings, I just ordered some random sandwich. I took it with me when I left the facility but dumped it in the nearest trash bin. I felt bad wasting ""food"" and for a moment thought that maybe I should give it to some homeless person. Then again, if I had, they might think that I was trying to poison them.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,6,2,1,gWmgcNLiBVUMwNmcup1EdA

297061,2014-01-01,0,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,"Beware.... The poor reviews for this place mainly come from the shotty customer service and so far they are living up to expectations... I've lived close to this restaurant for a few years now and have yet to try it due to the reviews but decided to go for it this morning. 

I was searching on yelp for some delivery and this place popped up. Yelp offered the option to place the order on my iPhone app so I went ahead and ordered. I was able to place the order very easily and it have me a window of about 45min to an hour which I was fine with. Since this place is right around the corner from me I did follow up after an hour had passed just to check on the status. I was less concerned with the time and just wanted to make sure the order went through since I haven't ordered on my yelp app yet. 

I was greeted by a women on the other line who must have been having a bad day. I don't even think I was greeted with a hi or hello... Just beach cafe. I informed the women I ordered on yelp and wanted to see if everything went through, and when I could expect it. She began to tell me I couldn't have done that because they don't offer it... Well if your reading this review you well know there is an option for placing an order. I politely told her there was an option and I ordered a few items and have already been charged for it. She continued to tell me I was wrong in a rude tone and then asked where I lived to which she mentioned someone just left to deliver it. I thanked her for checking and also told her she should take a look on yelp to see the option offered since it got them business. 

When the delivery guy came I showed him the yelp app with the delivery option and informed him of my experience with the women on the phone. He apologized and the only thing I do feel bad about is I wish I would have given him a bigger tip than what I left originally but the women really bothered me with her rude/condescending tone. You would think after so many similar poor reviews these people might make an effort to change their ways. 

Overall the good was good and I would like to give this place another shot and re-review at a later date to see if maybe I just caught this place on a bad day....",k-_aq7I7_L-GNd1irbxLIA,6,0,1,HON4a5T8ebq74ssJMrx6eQ

The place is small, she was working at the counter about 10 feet away, so she couldn't miss us, but it looked like her ""mornng routine"" was not to be interupted, so we waited.  We ordered right away, I had eggs benedict and the kids had pancakes. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out.  The food wasn't bad, wasn't great, either.  Nothing at all remarkable. 

The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the service. The waitress was not friendly, she didn't come back to our table at all after she brought our food. We waited 15 minutes after we were done eating for our check, I finally asked my grandson to go ask the waitress for it (at this point, its 8:15 and we're still the only diners). He stood at the counter and she ignored him, finally looking at me like ""what does he want""? I told her we needed our check. When I went to pay, the woman at the register was talking to a guy at the counter who had just come in. They chatted for a few moments about his new apartment and she finally walked over to ring me up.  As she was doing that, the phone rang, she answered it, and then stopped checking me out to take a phone order, as I stood there. and waited. and waited. and waited.  I was finally rung up and we were out of there by 8:30.

Its pretty obvious this place makes their breakfast business on takeout orders. Walk in customers are secondary.

I woke up late so I could not eat any breakfast (my most important meal of the day).  Walking around nearly 1 1/2 hours with empty stomach, I was starving by the time I was finished with my business!  So I looked up a breakfast & brunch in the area. 

I had several choices:  Baby-Stacks, Egg works, Cracked Egg, Daily Egg, etc.  But I chose this location because I have tried Baby Stacks and Egg Works; and I figured Cracked Egg and Daily Egg would be very similar to Egg Works.  So I decided to try this place.

I ordered Surfs Up Veggie Scramble and Cappuccino....  I ate the whole thing, but I would not say that it was good.  I mean. I was definitely hungry and so I ate.  Usually when I'm hungry, I feel like the food tastes better... However, I just thought I should eat because I'm hungry... 

The cappuccino was a little luke-warm and not hot enough.  The roasted potatoes(?) were decent but the scrambled egg (the main dish) was a little bland and too oily.  Adding ketchup to it helped the bland flavor.

The service was very casual and I'm not complaining.  It is a casual dining place, and I do not expect much.  I cannot say that the staff is friendly though... The server did her job definitely.  She wasn't mean or rude.  She just did her job. So I would just a smile would have been nicer.  

I am not sure if I will go back.  I mean, if I am in the neighborhood again, I would probably hit up another breakfast cafe to try.  However, I wouldn't mind eating here again and trying one of their burgers and smoothies... IF this is the closest location.",ByU-4bg5ENiLgtEmkilicA,1,4,3,w_yWGTJXCzXviQKJTq_5KQ

I have always been weary of trying new places, I mean I love doing it but at the same time you're always scared it's a miss.

Plenty of seating, and everyone is pretty friendly. There menu is nice, I mean I wish they were in Cali where the beaches are. It makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast/lunch place we have here. But at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when I come back. Me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here. I ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon. And their iced coffee. I'll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down, but it did its job and it's free refills. Their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too. I did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too. I mean I wish I had tried more variety but I'm kind of a plain jane kind of guy. The cafe breakfast ended up being my go to, and I'm not a huge breakfast person. They also have specials here and there. They had a captain crunch French toast that was to die for . The prices were fair, I usually ended up paying about 10 for my food and drink. On top of it if you're the type to frequent this place. Ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about I believe 10 or 12 meals. But hey, free food is always good.",oRfDZ_38v9DaaVwwA3Pwuw,0,0,5,yGx6pCdovwOQpiIjlweMig

Beach Cafe definitely has the best Corn Chowder I have ever had. It is so creamy, with big chunks of chicken, sausage, peppers, corn. 

They also have an amazing Southwest Chicken Salad, served with a tortilla on the bottom. 

I have ordered several items off their menu, and shockingly for me they have the best frappachino's too! They are made with ICE CREAM = yum, especially on these hot Vegas days. 

I would highly recommend going there at least once. I have never eaten in the restaurant I always order the food to go, and they have offer free delivery service which is very convenient.

The are fluffy and packed with blueberry and the flavor actually reminds me of birthday cake. Thumbs up beach cafe, thank you for feeding me on my way to a 14 hours shift!!

Unfortunately since my last review the food quality has gone a little downhill. On my last visit , my wife and I came in for our favorites a stack of blueberry pancakes and my island scramble and for her the Hawaiian burger with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. This time around my scamble was missing the flavors that I became accustomed to. It was pretty bland so I skipped ahead to my favorite pancakes. I was very upset when my light fluffy delicious cakes ended up being wayyyyy too sweet and were crunchy. As for my wife's burger , it was over cooked the pineapple was soggy and they forgot the teriyaki sauce. As they did bring her a side of sauce, it ended up being extremely salty. I have never tasted a teriyaki sauce so salty and yet so thin. It ran and tasted more like a soy sauce with a sugar packet dropped in it. I want to give it another chance , but paying $40 for two meals that were hardly edible. Not going to happen anytime soon.",eWjOpwT29ALgoaYfTMo0oQ,0,0,3,bnzJxPlP4KegelWUvilZ-g

I arrived Sunday morning about 9 a.m.  Only one other patron
was there.  I ordered the ""big island scramble"" for $8.95.  I found
the potatoes good, but the egg scramble tasted very bland.  Even
the english muffin was bland.  The cook puts these itsy bitsy pieces
of bacon, ham and sausage in the scramble.  You might need a
magnifying glass to find them.  Even the cheese was cheap.  No
taste.  The waitress twice asked if I liked it, but I think she could
tell by my face that I didn't.  I told her my scramble needed some
pineapple chunks to spruce it up.  She offered a ""side"" of pineapple...
for extra money of course!  I declined.  I don't mind spending $10
for breakfast when it is good.  This breakfast was not good.  Plus
it took at least 15 minutes to get my meal.  Much too long! 

The pleasant waitress brought me the water I asked for.  But it wasn't
until I was ready for the check did she offer a refill.  Moreover, the lemon
wedges for the water were tart and sour.

 I ordered a salad, a wrap, egg salad sandwich, 2 smoothies, and a coffee.

The asian wrap was great and it came with fresh fruit which tasted delicious. The 2 smoothies, Wipe Out and Jamaican Me Crazy, were right on key! The coffee could have been fresher.

Disappointing orders:

Eggs Benedict: A pretty straightforward dish that consists of english muffin, layered with a slice of canadian bacon/ham, poached egg and the most important - hollandiase sauce. What would make or break the dish would certainly be the hollandaise sauce. Well, from experience with more than a handful of different versions of ""eggs benedict"" dishes I've had in the past, their sauce wasn't great or even good in my opinion. The home fried potatoes weren't any better..

Ortega Burger: Came with chili, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalapeno mayonnaise. I didn't think I could've gone wrong with this one but it wasn't nearly as satisfying as the description. The meat was on the dry side, the chili was blah and I didn't notice anything special with their jalapeno mayo spread. Fries were fine, better than anything else offered this morning. I'd rather have Carl's Jr's.  ""Santa Fe"" Chicken sandwich over this any day.

Inside, the place seems like a basic cafeteria with some beach decorations. They have your typical ""mellow music"" playing as well.

Service was... ok. They weren't really that attentive to me, however that being said, it did look like all of them were pretty busy doing things such as putting things away, cleaning, restocking, etc. so at least it wasn't because they were just slacking off on the job.

Now, I wasn't planning on posting at that point. Just wanted to call the restaurant and let them know about their mistake so they won't do it to someone else. 

Made the call, put on hold because busy. No problem. Told hostess who picked up who then got the manager. I tell her what I just told ya'll: overcooked eggs, eggshell. 

Manager (in dismissive tone): ""We don't give refunds, go back to Uber Eats""
Me: ""Um, that's not even why I'm calling. I just want to let you know so it doesn't happen again. Maybe let the cook know?""
Manager: ""...""

No taking of responsibility, no ""I'm so sorry!""
No ""What can we do for you?""

You can keep your trendy eggworks and all those overrated places, I'll take Beach Cafe any day of the week.  The food is always delicious and fresh.  I suggest the breakfast scrambles or sandwiches.  Weekly specials are innovative and I haven't found any other place that serves Captain Crunch french toast.

For all you cheap people out there that don't like to spend money on going out to eat; first off, you are annoying and second this place is right up your alley.  It's not expensive.  If you think it, you have issues.  Food is rarely more than $8 so don't let cost deter you from coming in.  Furthermore they have a frequent diner stamp card so after 10 meals, you get one free. 

The coffee is excellent and so are there vanilla creamers!  They also have excellent passion ice tea.  The staff and servers are also wonderful.  Again, I'm not sure why there are bad reviews of the service here.  I've had nothing but wonderful experiences.  You are not treated like a random patron, they treat you like family here.  I don't even need to order, they always remember what I like.  I even get secret menu hash browns sometimes.  

The dining area is always clean, and there is a nice little bar area complete with a TV to watch my fantasy football team get destroyed on Sundays.  I don't just give out 5 star reviews on yelp, you have to earn it; and Beach Cafe definitely did.  It is by far; the best breakfast spot in the SW part of town.

2732728,2011-06-16,2,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,"I walked in and experienced the same thing Raymond B. did: stood in the middle of the room and looked like a lost sheep. After a minute of deciding I didn't have time to wait around, I sat at a table in the corner.  After no one even looked my way for about 5 minutes, I thought, ""Okay, maybe this is an order-at-the-counter kind of place"". So I walked up to the counter and asked if I could order. The lady at the counter seemed sincerely surprised that I was there, and said I could take a seat as she called the waitress over. The waitress apologized for the wait and after that bumpy start, service was fast and friendly.

I was dying for a smoothie and realized that they had all the tropical flavors I loved, so I ordered the Hawaiian cooler. I didn't realize that they didn't use fresh fruits, like I was expecting, but the smoothie was tasty nonetheless. A little on the sweet side for my tastes since they use fruit juices from the box, but with a little water mixed in it was fine. 

I had the fish tacos, which had fried pollock according to the menu, and they were really, really delicious. My only gripe about it is the salsa. I prefer a salsa verde with fish tacos because I think the tomatillo is a better complement for fish, but they didn't exactly have a salsa bar going so I didn't ask them about it. If they had at least 1 other salsa option that wasn't red and didn't taste like something pre-made, I think I'd definitely say these would be my most favorite fish tacos in town. Also, I thought they would come with tortilla chips, but they didn't and normally this would be a huge no-no for me but the order actually came with 3 really yummy tacos so that was more than enough to fill me up. 

I'm excited to come back and try their breakfast menu because... well, because I really freaking love breakfast food. Also, the sandwiches on their menu looked really good too.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,2,1,4,KZOonVdH-TEZDkgfDMEiuA

We came in at 7:15am to eat breakfast, we were here before work so we had about 40mins we could spend here. At 7:30 our order was taken but the cook was doing some sort of inventory so our food wasn't going to be getting prepared for some time. We asked them to cancel their order and said thank you and the woman upfront just ignored me. I was at no point being rude with her but she felt the need to be dismissive towards me. She didn't even great us when we walked in, they actually looked at us shocked that someone would come in within their business hours.

I pretty much only shop local and if I can't shop local I at least purchase products manufactured in the U.S.A.

2982727,2016-10-05,0,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,"It was 10 AM. And just less than a mile away from my home, Beach Cafe has truly hit me both its food and its scene. As soon as I walked in, not only I was welcomed, but I was hit full-on of nostalgia. As a former islander of 12 years from Hawaii, I was longing to find a new eatery, scenery, and grinds that will not only satisfy my longing stay in Vegas but at least make me feel welcomed as a new local. And, to my surprise, my new home has never felt so close when I first entered Beach Cafe. 

As soon as I sat, I looked into their menu right away. Ranging from scrambled eggs, south-of-the-border breakfasts, to benedicts and burgers, to pancakes, french toast, and waffles as well. But of course, I just had to take a look and feel the scenery, too. The vibe was great. The morning atmosphere truly does help represent the scene of a beach. But next is the food. 

My first order of course: coffee.  
It was fresh, no fancy gimmick, just classic. The overall result: sublime. 

Now, straight into the entreé: The Surf's Up Veggie Scramble.
The eggs were fresh, smooth to chew along with yummy peppers blended with cheese, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, all sauteed well within the eggs. The bread was perfectly toasted, the diced potatoes were cooked very well to the point that it's not hard but not too smooth to chew (Yes, I'm anal like that). The overall result: Seconds, please. I beg of you. 

Overall, the place was fantastic. I could stay there and have a relaxing read, or just stop by for a quick breakfast or brunch. They do delivery as well. But, just knowing the fact that this wonderful place is close by?

Well, let's just say, that I truly and finally feel at home. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get back as I am starving for what they have in store.

P.S If you're jonesing for some desserts afterwards? I beg of you, try the Copa Banana. No regrets.

I have never not tipped a a restaurant before, until now. I'm a server so I know how it goes. But I have never and would never give such terrible service to anyone. Working on the strip being slammed, dealing with drunk and obscene people I have not even treated them so poorly, yet for us being the only guests in the building? There is no excuse for not once saying, ""You're welcome,"" after I say thank you multiple times upon receiving waters, food, the extra roll up we asked for, her taking our order... She just turned and walked away each time. The only time we received one was when she realized she forgot the smoothie my boyfriend ordered at the end of our meal and finally brought it over. We received no proper greeting, no social interactions, nothing... Not to mention when she finished taking our orders she just threw the menus on the table next to us and left them there. On top of it all she never even gave us her name. She was probably aware of her shit service and didn't want to risk being called out. 

On to the filthy restaurant and terrible health standards of our server. Upon walking in we immediately realized the floors and tables were disgusting. There was dirt and pieces of trash in the corners on the floor next to us. The manager along with our server and another employee were all handling a dog, which yeah not really okay to have the dog behind the bar but I would have let it slide had ANY of them bothered to wash their hands. Our server literally held the dog and was petting it, turned around; and grabbed the gravy I had asked for off the food window... Brought the gravy to me, bussed some plates, answered the phone, handled money, and put some items into a fridge all without once pausing to wash her hands. I was disgusted to the point where I debated even eating the food she brought to me. The other employee didn't even bother washing her hands after handing the dog off then going to portion ice cream.. Do they even have health cards? Working in the restaurant industry for the past almost 7 years now and attending culinary school, I cannot fathom how these two even managed to get hired at a restaurant.

Not one of the bad reviews has a response from the owner. That isn't good. 

I have ordered from here about 10 times using amazon delivery and most the time the food is decent. Amazon service is good but the food prep was lacking sometimes. 

Fruit was small, didn't seem very fresh, and gave a lot of hard pieces of melon. They should use something to wrap the breakfast sandwich to hold the stuff in place because sometimes the cheese is only covering half and stuff was falling out.

The other thing is they send advertising for grubhub when I ordered on amazon. Showing total disrespect to the company that brought you the 10+ orders I've gave you just shows again the disrespect they have for others.

I talked to one of the owners and she told me that they were modeled after a place on the beach in So Cal. I had also mentioned that my husband liked Eggs Benedict and that I would be coming back with him and she suggest the Cali Bene and that once a month they have a lobster Bene for a week.

When my order came out it smelled delicious! The iced tea was pretty standard but the tacos were breaded pollock with cabbage and sour cream on corn tortillas and salsa on the side.  The fish was very fresh and the breading did not overpower the light flavor of the fish. Everything was fresh and yummy. I will be returning to this cafe more often.",KkC3O8dID6W-uJRCU3vBDw,0,0,4,ABpCiGhJhL1e0A5EwTQQnA

The menu was a step up from your typical diner fare though. There were sammies, plates, salad and a board with specials. Since it was brunch time and once I saw the main special, I knew I had to have it - the tamale omelette! You know i posted a pic of that bad boy too. So basically it was a chicken tamale chopped up in the omelette then covered in pepper jack. My friend got one of their sammies, but i didn't even pay much attention since mine was so damn tasty.

The only things she said to us was ""I'll be right with you guys "" and she never came back. Finally a brown haired older woman who acted like the owner came by and asked if we had been helped. No. So she then proceeded to take our orders. She was excellent but by the end of our meal I was so irritated I couldn't help but tell her the truth. The other waitress took the couples check to them ( right beside us) all the while never looking our way. I also got up to ask for more napkins. The blonde girl overheard me ask and said she would bring them and so she did. Then the brown haired woman came and also brought more napkins. Thank you. I also approached the counter my way in because it was my first time. I wasn't greeted until I came to counter which the nice brown haired woman helped me.

While everyone else is being handed their checks I was the only one who had to go up to the counter yet again ( third time) to ask for some customer service. My check came out to about $24.

Caramel Frozen Mocha

So I was quite let down when i held the CK sandwich and my fingers were all greasy and oily.

The sliders came in 4 but it was pretty small and dainty.  Forgot if it had caramelized onions, but it at least had some sort of cheese. The Waffle Fries are good but who doesn't like Waffle Fries?  

Service was standard, and i hear they have good brownies.  But then again it's from my friend that raved enough about it to take me here. Soooo.. I need a second opinion before I ever come back.

It was yummy. Their was an amazing looking dessert plate with brownies, little cookies...BIG cookies with cream in the middle. I just had a tiny shortbread cookie drizzled with chocolate. It was good... the consistency reminded me of a Mexican Wedding Cookie. I only took one cookie because I thought I would have time to go back but It was too busy. One of my cubicle mates was raving about their wraps ..saying it's the best wrap she's ever tasted. She was like , ""Why don't you get one ?

So she gets me this Chinese Wrap (we didn't know the wrap my co worker was raving about was the Southwest Wrap) The Chinese Chicken Wrap had chicken, celery, carrots and those crunchy noodles you usually put on top of salad.

Let me first say, that I have never eaten in the restaurant. All of my experiences with Beach cafe have been via carryout or delivery.  As I mentioned, the food is good, the problem is getting the food you actually ordered.  Of the 5 times I have ordered from them, 3 of them we wrong.

Already a bad first impression then the table next to ours is pretty dirty and this place is not busy at all. Even worse then all of this is some staff member was behind the bar with a dog in her hands and went back and forth between there and a bar stool and handed the dog to our server and then our server played with it and handed it back and then brought us the gravy we asked to try without a single pause to wash hands. Scarier. Then the girl with the dog goes back to work in the kitchen preparing food and the dog has completely disappeared. No way to know if she washed her hands either since it seems to be pretty lax here. Very unprofessional not to mention unsanitary who's in charge here letting this happen? 
So now to the food. Belgian Waffle. Add bacon $2 for three pieces of bacon. Tf? Waffle was whatever. 
The four burger sliders were pretty good. 
The beachcomber was bland with very spicy salsa to make up for it. 
And the lava run or something along those lines shake i ordered our server completely forgot about and then when she said ""oh did you still want that"" about 10 minutes after we got our food. I said yes she makes me a pina colada icy sort of strawberry thing which yes was good but the drink I ordered was a strawberry banana with vanilla ice cream shake... 
Now during this whole process hand washing is very questionable and I don't even think it even happened at all to be honest. During majority of our visit we were the only ones there except for the dog lady who looked like she worked there too. Our server was terrible. I would probably get better service from someone if I walked into their own house slapped them in the face and told them to make me a sandwich. The worst service I've ever had never looked us on the eye or made any sort of conversation or greeting or anything and when she took our menus after we ordered she literally just threw them on the table next to us and left them there. One of our roll ups also literally looked like it had a booger on it so we asked for another. 
Bottom line is this place is really only for those who are brave and adventurous and going LOOKING for a bad experience. If you came in with that mindset it would probably be amusing. I would go there just to see the worst restaurant you've ever seen in your life it's extremely dirty and questionable with terrible manager presence and customer service.
The worst part is that the food is really cheap and I would love to explore the menu but wouldn't come back ever. 
Jokes aside avoid this place at all costs absolutely horrid sanitation and health code violations literally everywhere and no one seems to know its a massive violation or no that it just makes the establishment look horrible",5LU8ejCPg88auLUHatSz_w,2,1,1,y1B0JVdn4hgFPcJBTiZAww

Both tasted a little bit oily, but had good flavor. They have waffle fries and crinkle fries available and both are good as well. If you like Arnold Palmers (1/2 and 1/2 ice tea and lemonade), they have a Sun Kissed Ice Tea which uses their tropical blend ice tea and lemonade--easily my favorite part of the meal.

My boyfriend and a friend of ours I came here for lunch to try it out based on the reviews on Yelp... Pretty disappointing. At first it seemed like a pretty laid back environment until we sat down and actually looked around. First of all they have the most uncomfortable chairs in town, and the seating was just crappy, they need to upgrade their tables and chairs desperately. The decor was awful, they have old bathing suits stapled to the ceiling and everywhere you look. It was overkill. 

Then we waited for our friend for a while. It took a long time to get refills on waters, our friend ordered a water and didn't even get it until our food finally came, which took quite some time, and the waitress was behind the counter texting half the time. 

The food, once again, took a while to come out. I ordered the grilled monterey chicken which was soaked in grease. I was expecting something somewhat healthy, but this was just nasty. I felt awful afterwards. My boyfriend go the Frisco burger, which was ok, but once again, greasy as hell. Our friend ordered fish tacos, which were mediocre and served with a lemon instead of a lime? Kind of odd. We did get a smoothie which was good... But it was almost $5, kind of expensive for how much we got. Better off going to Tropical Smoothie. 

Needless to say, this place was mediocre at best. Maybe it was just a bad experience? Their menu was intriguing and I was excited, but after I left I had a stomach ache due to the greaseball that I was only able to eat half of. Sadly, it wasn't even flavorful, it was really bland.

Sure, they have swimsuits hanging from the ceiling and a tiki theme going on.  

Walking in, the waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Using our Entertainment Book coupons, we thought we were restricted to the Breakfast menu only.  But the waitress was nice enough to let us use it for anything on the menu, which we definitely appreciated!

I chose the Del Mar Melt ($7.95), which consists of their homemade tuna salad with melted Swiss cheese and tomato on perfectly grilled sourdough bread.  Their tuna salad has crunchy bits of celery and was to my liking.  French fries also came with my order.

The Husband saw their Specials board, which meant he was getting the Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich ($8.75).  For those who crave a chicken fried steak but it's too late in the day, putting it between two pieces of bread easily does the trick.  The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, and mayo, with their homemade gravy on the side. French fries also came with his order.  I didn't see any complaints coming from him as he ate it all up! 

We also had a BOGO free smoothie, so we took ours to go.  My choice was their Sunburn smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which consists of passion fruit, mango, peach, strawberry juice, and crushed ice.

That being said, there is nothing worse than a lackluster plate of eggs. Oh, but I'm wrong! Couple mediocre eggs with poor service, Beach Cafe showed me all sorts of low.

Walking in, it is generally expected for you to seat yourself - after you overcome the awkwardness of glares from the bar patrons in the back. Service was generally slow, leaving us to scramble for menus and wait a few minutes before even being greeted. 

I had ordered the Cali Bene - eggs benedict with avocado, tomato, spinach with a side of home fries. One of my friends stuck to her favorite of chicken fingers (with the sole intention that the ranch was made in house). While one of my other friends, wavering with indecision, chose the Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. The food came out promptly, so I'll give the Beach Cafe that. However, taste was lacking. Hollandaise sauce soaked half the plate, which normally I do not mind. However, it was so salty that I attempted to dissect the parts of my benedict that had not been attacked with sodium. After three minutes, all hope was lost - my Cali Bene was fairly inedible. The home fries were decent, better in comparison to the salt fest next to it. As for my friends' food, the chicken fingers were good (not a difficult accomplishment). My other friend quickly demolished her soup (as much as I love brunch, so has the same affinity for soup). However, her egg salad sandwich was primarily two pieces of bread with a thin layer of egg salad. I took a bite, and was unimpressed - my school's dining hall has done better. 

What really set in my apathy towards this place was the lack of cordiality demonstrated by both the staff and the longstanding patrons. After a couple had left the restaurant, one of the staff members had engaged in openly mocking and criticizing them. The heckling riled the customers she had been talking to, and soon spread like wildfire. My party felt fairly uncomfortable afterwards - both out of shock for their lack of propriety as well as the fear that our departure would result in insult. 

Honestly, mediocre at best food. Service was fairly nonexistent, at best spotty. The only thing that could remedy this was 99 cent ice cream far, far away.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,2,kJNCYSMWxBvPscYM56LSGw

We got our own menus off of another table and were ready to order if someone would just acknowledge that we were there.  If we had to wait for our menus until the wait staff finally got around to us then we would have probably never gotten them.

This place is usually hit but sometimes miss. Of the several times we've ordered, the food has been delicious almost every time (we recommend the beachcomber scramble and blue Hawaiian smoothie) however literally almost every single time there was something wrong with our order, some small mix up (regular eggs instead of egg whites, extra cheese on the wrong dish, etc). This time we ordered two of the exact dish but one with extra chicken. They both arrived with extra chicken which is fine except there's a charge for it and we didn't want it on the second item and one arrived with the toast and potatoes it's supposed to come with and the other one inexplicably just didn't, the sides just weren't there. This type of thing is just extremely annoying but not worth complaining about and waiting for the correct food to arrive.

That's the next thing... The wait. They say the food will be there in 45 minutes to an hour but it's almost always 30 minutes late (takes about an hour and a half) like it was today. On the upside, it arrives very fresh with the food hot and smoothies still frozen.

There is only one time that was an absolute disaster. We didn't eat more than a few bites of any item. We aren't sure if this was due to our food choices as we had tried some new things off the menu or if it was due to whoever was cooking that day. Everything was soggy and tough. Blech.. 

In the end, we keep ordering from here so it's obviously not that bad. It's usually delicious, just a little mixed up and late. If they fixed those two things and were open a little later for us night owls it would probably be perfect.",Rro8Jx1qVLBqjMBKlfarQA,0,0,3,ZNYK4vAzQmqP-2lHj2rpMw

The outside of the place is understated.  It's part of a shopping center-style area in an unfamiliar part of town for me, but I wanted to see what their breakfast was about.  You'll have to drive into the lot to see where the place is (behind the gas station).

Inside, the beach decor is also understated (but nice), and while there was some wait associated with my order at times as some reviews stated, the service on my day was very friendly and conversational.  I wasn't in a rush, so I enjoyed the extra time.  A fellow needs time to wake up on a lazy Sunday morning.

I ordered the chili cheese scramble.  Honestly, a meal of this magnitude could go either way, but it was excellent.  The chili they used for it in particular was pretty darn tasty, and the meal wasn't greasy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entree, the side potatoes, and the toast that went with it.  I was actually sorry to have seen the meal ended.  I kept picking at the remnants of the sauce until they took my plate away.

The server was a very nice girl.  Very warm and personable.  And beverage refills came pretty regularly.  At the end of the meal, breakfast for two was just at $20.  For the amount of food and the taste, I really couldn't disagree with anything.

If you have ever walked into this place it has a different vibe... I am assuming they are going for the beachfront cafe, swim suits hanging from the ceiling, surf boards leaning on the walls and palms everywhere. I had never been here before so upon my original scan of the place it looks like you walk up and order then go sit down.. After standing in the middle of the room looking like a lost sheep for about 5 minutes they crabby waitress walked by and crudely said, ""  just sit anywhere"" and kept on walking. We sat down and both comment to each other, "" Wow that was rude!""  

She came back a few minutes later and handed us 2 menus and quickly said, "" do you need a kids menu?"" we again said Yes and it was a good 5 to 10 minute wait for the kids menu. Once we finally received the kids menu and decided what we all wanted we ordered..... 2 Cabo salads and a kids chicken fingers.. Now, just to set the stage here. There was 4 tables with people at them and all of them had there food so we happen to be the only ones without food so in my head I figured it would be fast. The waitress came by to see if we wanted something other than water to drink and I said sure, Ill take a iced tea. She brought the iced tea pretty quick which was nice but a few minutes later my iced tea was about half empty and she came by and grabbed it....... Now.. I was thinking that this entire experience was turning around, I could not be more wrong... Remember that Iced tea I was talking about? Well I didn't because she never brought it back. She even came by the table 5 minutes later to tell us that the food we will be out in a few and sorry for the wait. Now I know i could have said can i have my iced tea back but i figured she may have been busy and i would give her a minute. The food came out and I was half way through my salad and decided i would really like my iced tea so she came by to ask how the food was and I just mentioned, "" It is good, when you get a chance can I get an Iced Tea!"" it took another 5 minutes for that to come..... At this point I was done and did not want to be on the beach any longer. The food was okay but the wait service was less than horrible. 

I'm sorry Beach Cafe but I will not be back!!!! You need to hire some new wait staff and get rid of the grouch you have in the front... I have never seen a waitress walk around with such a horrible attitude! I know we all have bad days but in a customer contact position like that you need to be able to detour your pissiness for a little while.

The burgers were pretty good, cooked properly, and the toppings were fresh (no slimy lettuce). They also got the special order correct, having left the tomato off one of the two burgers, which is nice--it's easy to find a place that will add things correctly, but harder to find one that remembers to take them *off*, or at least remember *not* to put them on.

We were extremely pleased to find someplace that we didn't have to wait forever, but we weren't expecting much as far as both service and food.  I ordered a chicken apple sausage scramble, and they were insanely accommodating when I asked if they could substitute egg whites and add lots of spinach.  They were more than happy to.  I also had an iced tea, tropical flavor, and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it so they brought me a free sample without charging me.  Husband had a blueberry banana smoothie (it was excellent and low fat to boot, and I absolutely hate smoothies), and a big island scramble which essentially had tons of breakfast meat and cheese.

The dishes came out quickly, and they had probably the best home fries I have ever had.  They were huge chunks of red potato, that were crisp on the outside and soft and velvety on the inside, just like I love potatoes.  And perfectly seasoned.  This is how potatoes should be folks, not that petrified over seasoned crap from the egg works, egg and I, and that other crap.  I'd eat these every day, seriously. 

Everything else was delicious, and both my husband and I decided at that moment that this was the best breakfast we've had in town, and lucky us, it was just down the street.  And they DELIVER.

I have had biscuits and gravy, croissant breakfast sandwich, Turkey sandwich (avocado, mayo, tomato), the rueban, and more...and all were delicious. 

I added a bagel to my order the other day (like I have many times before), and it was dry and tasted like cardboard. First time I was disappointed with the bagel. Occasionally the potatoes will get to my house and be less than average, but I understand they deliver it so I cut them slack. 

My two favorite drinks are the frozen coffee (not Carmel or white chocolate) and the tropical iced tea. The Carmel and white chocolate frozen coffee drinks have a gritty texture that is not the sugar, but is sweet (like a powdered flavoring). It's strange. I get the regular frozen coffee and it is perfect. The tropical iced tea is incredibly refreshing. I recommend this place. However, do not be in a hurry. Delivery usually takes 45-60 min.

Everything is fresh and homemade. This places opens around 10 and closes around 2 or 3 depending on the day so keep that in mind. Also their fruit smoothies are the best in the city hands down!,OWJ-4cZ-zjyQCjcEaVJFfA,0,0,5,xiDSoQnIIE-hw-ucAIoSHg

The laid back beach decor and music makes for a enjoyable breakfast, lunch, or brunch. Coffe is good. Usually on the strong side but good nonetheless. My husband swears by the Big Island Scramble. My 7yr old usually ordered the cafe breakfast and substitutes the fried potatoes for fresh fruit, and the folks here are always accommodating. The fried potatoes are fresh. Nothing frozen about them. And they taste GOOD ! The bread they use for toast etc is excellent quality.

The location is a little strange since it is behind a gas station, but don't let that bother you. It's between Primo Pizzaria and Cafe Casera.",MV3Pfu7x205_3OBtyRIusg,2,0,5,UrMVpy3OL7ej2bnYzIZJZA

I ordered the chili cheese scramble and the other ordered the veggie scramble with sausage. The food is tasty and filling at the right price.
The missing star is for the service. The service was not the best nor the worst. The server spoke to us as if we weren't priority to them. However, she saw that one of the orders were not correct before we even saw it, which is why I will not give them three stars.",fcra9uhtCHmpXdhDamb5cg,0,0,4,9qRGEIIGGnGTh5ceBHOXWQ

Ordered lunch two times and breakfast one time. I can't say I recommend any of the 2 smoothies I've had because they really taste so sweet it's like diabetes in a cup. 

The smoothies: Wipe Out and Jamaican Me Crazy Smoothie. Super sweet. Not advised unless you're a sweets person. 

Grilled chicken sandwich - portion is huge (for me, at least) but it was pretty good. 

Mission Beach Fish Tacos - I wasn't disappointed with these. They were pretty good and definitely filling for me. Managed to even eat all 3 pieces since I don't typically eat a lot in one sitting. 

Breakfast order today: 

Since I'm a bit iffy about their smoothies, I ordered a Frozen Mocha (blended iced espresso, low-fat ice cream, and chocolate).

After placing our order, we received notification that it would be 75 minutes instead. It arrived almost 90 minutes after we placed our order. My sandwich came slightly warm and with wax paper melted into it. It was supposed to be on a ciabatta bread and it came on a plain roll. My husband's order had avocado in it and it wound up being one small piece for the whole sandwich. The fruit cups we selected with our orders had a total of 6 chunks of fruit each, 3 cantaloupe and 3 pineapple. The fries we ordered on the side were cold and soggy. Very disappointed.

Does it really take 2 hours to cook eggs and sausage? Uhm no. Food is really cold. Not warm at all. Drinks are wrong and taste so watered down and warm also. This place is just awful. I've tried it so many different times and each time I've been let down. Called and asked for our free drinks that they got incorrect the day before and she said ""we don't deliver to your address"" You've delivered atleast 10 times to this house are you stupid? I'm sorry but this is a horrible business. I don't know why they are still running. Very rude. Then only says I'll do it this one time since we owe you something. Okay, who the hell talks to a customer that way when you're horrible restaurant got the order incorrectly then says no worries tomorrow you guys can get them for free tomorrow.

The food was mediocre, and not even worth taking the time to describe, so I won't waste your time reading about it either.
Here was our biggest issue - There were two other people in the restaurant and we waited WAY too long for our meal, now I didn't actually time it but here's my best idea: The kids came out first, after over 5 minutes, then they were 1/2 finished, then mine came out, hmmmm, where's my wife's scrambled eggs??? The kids were done, I was more than 1/2 done, then hers came. What was the cook doing? Seriously, no one else there, it took about 20 minutes. But here's the kicker - a few people came in while we waited for our food and a guy that looked like the owner just sat there and talked to some girl the whole time. I guess he wasn't concerned about running his business and he definitely wasn't concerned about us.
I am not a restaurant trasher on Yelp, and I hate to rate anything this low, but I felt inclined to share. There are too many other restaurants trying their best and this place isn't one of them.",tzjyKDWLnrwrCRP7n-cWwQ,3,1,1,dU7EaxYGbAf5k2iNJo5d_g

5928966,2011-01-04,1,atVh8viqTj-sqDJ35tAYVg,"Back in the summer of 2010, my father-in-law suggested this place. He had read somewhere that Beach Café was one of the ""best places to eat breakfast in Las Vegas."" Ever since that first visit, we have become regulars who dine here at least once a month. When my husband and I lived in California, this would be our first stop after that 3-4 hour drive from Cali to Vegas. We used to drive in really early in the morning, so this place was perfect because it opened at 7am!

I like the laid-back beach theme of the restaurant, with swimsuits hanging from the ceiling and surfboards on the walls. I was born and raised in Hawaii, so it really feels like home! It also makes you feel like you are enjoying a relaxing day at the beach! 

The food is pretty good. I'm not really a breakfast person, but I do like the Ed's Biscuits and Gravy. The sausage gravy is just right, not too sweet and not too salty. My only complaint is that the 4 biscuits they give you are kind of small. I just tried the South Shore Sliders the other day, and they were great! The perfect size with the right amount of French Fries and they are served on those yummy Hawaiian Sweet Rolls! My favorite thing on the menu is the Lava Flow Smoothie, which is a sweet mix of strawberries, bananas, coconut, and vanilla ice cream. Very delicious! 

Robyn always helps us. She is very nice and friendly! The other employees are great as well. If you sign up for their emails, they will send you coupons and let you know what their weekly specials are.

The waitress did not look happy at all to be serving us although she had only one other table besides ours. 

When my friend asked for cream for her coffee she gave her attitude & told her she was busy and would be with us as soon as she can. She also never came back to ask if we'd like refills on our drinks.

The eggs Benedict was really great as was the price for it & that's what the two stars are for. 

Our check came right away, but took 20 minutes to be picked up by the waitress as she was socializing with other co-workers. 

Overall, the food was great, but service is what makes me not want to recommend this place to my friends.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,4,1,2,teKYiNofMyT5fBwbcXjr7Q
