852051,2008-03-03,2,SDaO5XUo3NIavCCnnl1lDA,"I believe I'm making a point of trying to eat at a restaurant twice before giving it a review.  I did so with the Gambler's Grill, but sometimes you don't want to go back.  In the case of The Original Pancake House, I won't make the mistake a third time. (I did eat at one of these restaurants at Green Valley Ranch, but this review is specific to this particular property).

Both times were lunch outings, so I ordered a sandwich both times.  This is not a restaurant to eat at for anything other than breakfast, really.  Hence the name, I suppose, breakfast seems to be a better choice.  I ordered a sub sandwich the first time, which was okay but nothing to Yelp about.  The second time I wanted to change things up so I ordered a Grilled Ham & Cheese.  When the order arrived 30 minutes later (making us late to get back to work), all I received was a small sandwich and a few hash browns.  I paid $8.19 for this? I was fairly annoyed not only by the wait but by the inconsistency in the size of their meals.  The sub sandwich was much larger and filling and took half the time to get to me than this second time around.  People next to us, who arrived later, received their order first.  The food was fine, but I've had better elsewhere (such as Gambler's Grill).

The only thing I was happy about was due to a disappointment from the first visit.  My waitress never brought me a box for my sub sandwich.  When I went to get one from the front counter, I turned around to see the busboy tossing all of our food into the bin.  The manager saw this as she was handing me the box.  As there was little she could do to save the food, she got me a $10 discount off of our next meal.  Pretty much the only reason we came back again was to use this discount.

The crepe was actually pretty good.  The chicken mixture in it kinda tasted like what you would get in a chicken pot-pie; but instead of carrots/peas, you get red/green peppers, mushrooms, and olives.  

It came with four potato pancakes.  Now, these are NOT latkes, these are four extremely thin, almost flavorless sheets of potato.  As if someone made hash browns, froze them, and shaved a few layers off of the top.  It needed salt, pepper, anything.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to a place with cornucopia of pancake choices, but none of the food was great.  The blueberry pancakes just weren't remarkable and the blueberries weren't fresh or flavorful.  They came with a dusting of powdered sugar, which was a nice touch, but all in all the pancakes were blah.  The Continental Crepe was similarly mediocre -- the actual crepe was good, but was overwhelmed by too much sour cream in the filling.  The side of ""German potatoes"" was also surprisingly flavorless.  In the end, the only remarkable part of the meal was the side order of bacon -- quality pork with perfect crispness.

Breakfast done right, priced for the quality and quantity received, and world class service.

The last visit, the Mrs. wanted to add some salsa to her eggs.  She asked the waitress how hot (spicy) it was, and was given a sample taste.  Not hot enough for her liking.  The manager overheard her tell the waitress that it wasn't hot enough, so he stops by the table and tells her that it is his recipe, and asks if she wants to try a hotter version.  Now, what other breakfast place can you name where the manager takes that much pride in his salsa and makes a batch for a solo customer?  More known for egg sauces and pancake syrup (and obviously, bacon) than homemade salsa, that was a nice touch!

I wanted my first review to be about a place I've never had problems with and OPH was the first thing that came to mind.

Located in Las Vegas near the Arizona Charlie's on the corner of Charleston and Decatur, I always make it a point to visit OPH for breakfast when I'm in town--usually the Sunday morning before we head back to Cali.

The serving is generous, even their half-orders are more than enough for my friends who don't want too much.  It's also one of the few places I know that serves potato pancakes...or maybe I haven't been out much.  Regardless, their potato pancakes are top notch.  It goes great with a side order of corned beef.  The omelettes are amazing.  I'd love to know how to make omelettes the same way OPH does at home if I could.  Mind you, I'm not even mentioning the other pancakes--you jus can't go wrong with any of em.  You just have to try them for yourself.  Almost everyone I know has their own preference: the one with their favorite fruit, the one with the chocolate chips, and the famous Dutch Baby.

Bottom line:  when you're in Vegas, it's definitely worth a few minutes trip from the Strip to enjoy this place.

was on the menu. My friend the Host With the Mostest in Las vegas (HWMLV), whom I have known for over half of my life, claimed he did not know this word, ""challah""! 
Nutters! 

Since college, I had the chance to attend my share of break Fasts, Seders, etc... so 'challah' to me was just another baked good from the Noe Valley Baking company. Everyone knows that, right? Or so I thought! 

Thank you, HWMLV, for knowing about the two for one deal from the paper. I'm all about the cheap eats.. and I'm all abou the OPH. 
Yum, yum, yum. Come hungry and for the best selection: SHARE! 

Their Apple Pancake: There is no reason why one human should be consuming ONE of these in one sitting by themselves. (I'm scared to even ask about the nutritional value of it, but eating ONE would be akin to eating 4-5 apple fritters. At least.) 

Their house specialty is this apple pancake (see pic above), created with care and it comes out hot, fluffy and much like an apple pastry. IN any case, it's a must try, in my book. 

Cinnamony and chewy, it's a nice start to the day (even though we got started kinda late, but you know Vegas) 

We also split the eggs benedict (see pic above) which comes with a side of 4 potato pancakes. Yummy, but these thin potato pancakes were thin crepe like concoctions... unlike the thick fried patties of goodness I remember from my college days.  No worries, it was still quite tasty. 

NOTE: the applesauce and sour cream that arrive with your meal is the accompaniment to the potato pancakes. Just FYI. I think you all knew that though. 

The eggs benedict hollandaise sauce was quite yellow and eggy, but the balance of ham/egg/english muffin was perfect...

Other than that disappointment, yesterday's brunch was awesome. I got a 1/2 order ($2 off the original price of 8.49) of the bacon pancakes and wow were they excellent. I'd never tried anything like those pancakes and I'm gonna have to try that at home now and see if I can do anything even close to those. The lady had the Apple Waffle and she said it was amazing too. We split an order of the aforementioned sausages and an order of the country potatoes. They were both very good, but the sausages were not worth the money for damn sure. Excited to go back and try one of their egg specialties, omelets, or maybe one of the crepes. They have a great selection on the menu and the prices are very good for most of their items. The country breakfast atmosphere in the restaurant was very homey feeling and the service was excellent.

But I will never come here and spend my money ever again. Rude service!! We had a party of four people but only two of us were present. The hostess sat us anyway probably because there was no wait. So our third person came shortly after and we come to find out that we were actually going to be a party of five instead. So we politely told our server that we were going to have more people join and she rudely replies ""Well did you guys tell the hostess that? You're going to have to move into another station and you guys are taking up my table."" WOW. We are taking up her table????? I couldn't believe my ears. First off, not only did the hostess seat us at the table, which by the way we didn't insist on her seating us right away.. We would have completely understood if she told us to wait, BUT the host still sat us. Anyway, and to state the OBVIOUS, no one should ever tell a customer that. Ever.  I told her exactly that and I asked to speak to her manager. The manager was polite and told us she talked to her server and that she would make sure we would get another table with another server. So we sat in the front to wait. That's when we decided to leave and go to Jamms up the street where we know the service is always friendly and hospitable. Plus they have better food.

Now- I had been entertaining clients the night prior and may or may not have had too many martinis. So I may or may not have been seriously hungover. Which could explain why I took a picture of my coffee-cup (see pictures). The coffee was quite a welcome taste. NOT ""bad diner coffee"". I ordered Eggs Benedict and (yes AND) plain buttermilk pancakes. OMG. Everything was perfection. The food is a thrill- soooo delicious. My friend said they don't have hashbrowns- as you can see in the picture, you get potato pancakes. Yummy. I did NOT even peruse the menu- but I could see they have TONS of pancakes, omelets, and pretty much every breakfast concoction you can imagine.

3537269,2012-07-21,1,SDaO5XUo3NIavCCnnl1lDA,"My husband and I used to eat at this restaurant all the time.  We always loved the food.  However, the last time we were there , the manager disagreed with where we asked to be seated based on the placement of our highchair.  We did not realize that it was a problem.  Afterall, the hostess sat us there.

When the manager saw what happened, he aggressively approached our table, rapped his knuckles on the table, and loudly imformed us that ""this was never happening again"".  You betcha, Buddy, because after being chewed out by this manager like I was a tardy dishwasher, we weren't coming back.  I was angry and embarassed as this manager was loud enough that people at other tables were staring at us, so I emailed the restaurant's corporate offices right there from my phone.

A few days later, I received a phone call from the restaurant's general manager.  I think that her name was Lisa. At first, I thought that Lisa was going to work this out with me, perhaps apologize for her underling's poor behavior. That just wasn't going to happen.  What Lisa gave me was a second butt chewing.  She interrupted me time and again, and even accused me of being a bad mother because the placement of the highchair was dangerous and against city code, that she was more concerned about the safety of my child than I was.  Had she stopped talking over me for 2 seconds, she would have learned that my husband is an architect and has forgotten more about building and city codes than some diner manager would ever know.  What she didn't know that my husband did know was that the placement of the highchair was well within city egress requirements.

She then claimed to have reviewed the tape of the manager approaching our table and she that the table rapping never happened.  She was lying.  It did happen.  I saw it.  My husband saw it, and my baby jumped when he did it.  She either did not review the tape or there was no tape to review.  I seriously doubt that they have cameras trained on every table in any restaurant, much less a pancake diner.  

During this entire conversation, I kept trying to get a word in edgewise to complain about the way the first manager all but yelled at us.  It was awful, and soon as she was done verbally abusing me, she said goodbye and HUNG UP on me.  I was shocked.  She never had any intention of working this out.  Her intention was to bully me for daring to complain about one of her co-workers.  And sadly, we have lost one of our favorite breakfast spots because I will not contribute a nickel to that woman's salary.

I had heard, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that several restaurants in casinos had recently closed their doors.  If this is how they allow their manager to speak to people, I am not the least bit surprised.  I have since told everyone I know about the abuse that I suffered at this woman's hands and will continue to bad mouth this restaurant every opportunity I get.",Mm9qtARqNRg1AsknSk-yYg,6,0,1,ZFCdqWKaZiI0vqL-0RhLMA

I've been eating here for years and have come to th conclusion that you really do have to know what to order here, since not everything is as good as the pancakes (i.e the eggs benedict - go to Payard's in Caesar's for this).

I feel the omelets are the best option, which is one reason my anti-omelet husband would rather go to the Egg and I (he's a 'breakfast skillet' kind of guy). The omelets here are tremendous, both in flavor and size. I love that if you have a willing dining companion you can split one and both be completely satiated for a reasonable price. Normally I opt for the Western or the spicy Fiesta omelet, but this time we had the Irish, which included their home made corned beef hash and cheddar cheese enveloped in fluffy eggs. It was scrumptious, and might be my new favorite. Since the omelets come with a side of pancakes or toast, I always get pancakes (who would get toast?) and I ALWAYS upgrade to something more interesting than the ordinary plain cakes. This gets more expensive if you are ordering alone here (not recommended, you'll get to look like the people around you), but if you are sharing, it is totally worth it. I really like the blueberry and coconut varieties, but this time we shared something particularly indulgent, bacon AND chocolate chip pancakes, served with nothing less than freshly whipped cream. This is not on the menu, and the waitress might look at you funny (as ours did) but I promise you'll like it. It is reminiscent of the Voges chocolate bar, Mo's Milk Chocolate Bacon Bar (also highly recommended), and packs a powerful punch with a few of Earth's finest offerings - sugar, flour, bacon, whipped cream, and of course, chocolate. I'm actually not a chocoholic by any means, but these pancakes steer me in that direction. If you're in the mood to be sinful, these will make you feel like the devil. You can wash it all down with a glass of freshly squeezed orange or grapefruit juice, which are much better than juices offered at any other off-strip breakfast places.

To summarize, come here for the omelets, pancakes, corned beef hash, and juice - nothing else is that good. (Oh, i forgot to mention the potato pancakes are smokin')",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,1,1,4,xXX6bR0bjT6vSXs0yIhQnQ

A.-The Bacon Lovers with BANANA PANCAKES (add pecans) or

B.-The Strawberry Waffle

I don't know WHAT type of PIG these people use but...their bacon is RIDICULOUS.It's a thicker cut and MELTS in your mouth.My brother (the biggest bacon lover I know) describes it as ""bacon so good..it's worth the high blood pressure it will give you"". 

My bf and bff LOVE the omelettes. They dont look like a regular omelette but a yellow fluffy pillow.Except these pillows might be oozing out cheese.

The waffle and pancakes here are....(bows head) the waffle is so light and GREAT..so are the pancakes. I haven't went to IHOP since I've been to this place.I LOVE my ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE!

Take it from a regular..try NOT to go on the weekend and IF you order the bacon lovers TRY to share it instead of eating it all yourself.I did that once and went to sleep for 5 HOURS!!!",S_6pIhoNUG6QVUmOQUCq-w,1,0,5,0vrXuVlT7wIGy1BfryogNw

4.5 stars. This O.P.H. is kind of wayyyy out there away from the Strip. I mistook this location for the closer one on Ft. Apache to our hotel (The Rio). It took us a while to get out there and with minimal sleep and rest after the finish of our Baker to Vegas run, we were starving and super tired. 

I picked this place for breakfast and had great reviews and adda-boys from the 2 minivan carloads of friends that were hungry and attended breakfast this morning. Coffee, ginormous crazy hub cap sized omelets, pancakes and bacon were the stars of the morning on this visit. You can't go wrong with their pancakes, hence the name Original PANCAKE House. 

The service was also good, our waitress was training another new waitress and seemed to be a pretty good trainer. Coffee, water and drinks were always topped off. 

This may be an annual trip for breakfast after our runner crosses the finish line for the race. 

Plenty of parking, next to a B of A if you need the ATM (I don't like using the casino ATMs so this was perfect for me), clean establishment. We were seated right away...a party of about 12-13.",WG0kTEJJNfT1egnunxpsvQ,0,0,4,61NBE9yFQO6JM8AI1VW9Sg

Eversince I went to my first one in Charlotte, NC i fell in love with this place. Since then everytime I go to a city with an OPH in it I make it a point to have breakfast there. The OPH in Vegas is no exception. It is a great place to have breakfast, and a welcome escape from the Strip.

Their omelettes are amazing... I have yet to figure how they get them to be so crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. They make them from a lot of eggs and that means they are big.

The pancakes are great and their house specialty the Dutch Baby is awesome. And did I mention they serve freshly squeezed orange juice... nice!

Check this place out.

p.s. For those of you who are tourists, make sure you have a way to get back to the Strip as finding a cab out there or calling one is no simple task.",AKYT7Ky07-3MEh8NtC37eQ,0,0,4,fqVSY2dXmFMBoXcbjwB-JA

Crispy on the outside, and fluffy filled to capacity with yummy smoked gouda and spinach. THE BEST!! It was so delicious I would of gladly stuffed myself and eaten the entire thing. The next time I was in town I got one all to myself (Yummy!) and my daughter ordered the chocolate chip pancakes, which are good, but can put you in a sugar coma. Anyway, my five year old asks if she can try a bite of my omelet and she loved it! The kid scarfed down half of it. Damn, I may never get one all to myself. Next time, it will all be mine! The service was mediocre, but I can totally deal for food this great.",5GGrJ4RLPjFg5u3tWbOnGQ,0,0,5,-I6ZM2XyLwWY4FpSPSW4mg

This restaurant is a Northwest chain that has expanded through much of the U.S. I got bacon pancakes (i.e., bacon inside the pancakes) and a side order of sausage patties. The pancakes were heavy, the sausage not bad.

Too bad I didn't check here first - perhaps the house specialties (apple pancake or Dutch baby) are the way to go.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,0,2,5UcIv14dHf9zyE0YKLfVIQ
5896961,2011-07-28,0,SDaO5XUo3NIavCCnnl1lDA,"Without a doubt, all the chips are in, THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS.  I know they are a chain, but for some reason, their other state counterparts just aren't the same.
Out of the way if you are staying on the Strip or in Downtown, but worth the drive.  There's also one in Henderson in the Green Valley Ranch Casino that I go to and some other locations throughout Vegas.  Take the short trip, you won't regret it.
Perfect for that after-party binge, helps you get over that hangover.  Everything I've had there is good, but I highly recommend 2 things:
YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THEIR SWEDISH PANCAKES WITH LINGONBERRY SAUCE.  If you want something sweet, FLUFFY and straight up delicious then get this.  You may want to get a side of breakfast meat to balance out the tastes.
OR I go with the FRESH VEGETARIAN OMELETTE WITH THE 3 PANCAKES & A SIDE OF LINGONBERRY SAUCE.  Im not really a vegetarian type of guy (you can probably tell, if you've read the other reviews I've done), but this omelette is so light, fluffy and the veggies are so fresh that YOU WILL NOT REGRET EATING ""HEALTHY"".",7HjZ1VFUlS4guDWoh-0UHg,0,0,4,MRNktFjl623j9IZhxuEhSg

Found this place while searching for diner dive and dive places on the web. Not sure if it was featured, but the reviews were good. Prices are excellent and the food is amazing. Before we even got our food the OJ was the best I ever had, For breakfast I had the Santa Fe Omelet with 3 pancakes, OMG! Best omelet ever. The other orders were the western omelet and the Dutch Baby. All generous portions and delicious. This was a nice diversion from breakfast on the strip while in Vegas. Will surely be telling others about this place.",gxLf7JLLKVp6NVTBLJbsiQ,0,0,5,hHCzX6cqgw0grU-KVw1UdQ

This breakfast restaurant is out of the ordinary, the food was delicious, but the service was out of this world, everybody who works there makes you feel like you went back 20 years when service was important, very friendly, everybody smiling and Attentive.

One suggestion is that they should make serving water an option. Visiting from California where water is an option at restaurants to see the waste of water there shook me",aeQ_eo0fQ1LeAvSa8KpPZg,0,0,5,RJDeygGjigLoQiv-NpLYdQ
