387729,2015-05-12,0,rd8NXOBTsASiXriuooki_A,"First time ordering Domino's and it happened to be here. I think they're renovating the space, so I see their process of making pizzas.

This location's staff is pretty strange for being busy, so I'll list what I saw during my wait for a large pepperoni/sausage pizza.

1. The cashier guy was alright since he got a few calls during my ordering in front of him, so I had to wait for a bit and after paying I had to wait a longer while to get my receipt since someone on the phone ordered something big. 

2. The old man customer was getting a bit impatient by walking to different parts of the waiting area since there's no chairs to wait on.

3. While waiting for my receipt, I saw who appears to be the manager with very long blonde hair. It's tied high, sure, but the length of the hair was way too long above her butt still to just be free after the hair tie. The hair needed to be bunned or in a net because everytime she stepped, her hair swayed side to side proudly above the counter where they put the marinara on the dough.

4. After the cashier guy was done on the phone, there seemed to be some sort of panic about an order, so I saw a young tall, blonde woman/girl somewhat in the trash looking at a receipt and tucked it back in the garbage. Then I saw her kind of wipe or brush her hands on the apron and went to the cashier machine to look for order numbers since everyone's still calmly panicking.

5. The blonde girl went back to the pizza dough counter without washing her hands, so she brushed her hands again onto the apron. She moved three small/medium rised dough that seep over the plates (so she's touching the dough) onto the counter and started putting marinara onto them. Then she brushed her hands onto the apron again and went into the back to get a cheese box to refill the cheese.

6. The blonde girl keeps walking around slow and calmly, taking up time while the woman fixing and cutting all the finished pizzas and other food into boxes was in a panic. Seriously, she's either new or too tired, so she's taking up time looking for a knife to cut the cheese box or looking for whatever the other woman was needing. The cashier guy asked me to sign the receipt after the wait, and said he'll check up on my order because I don't want to see open marinara after he said there'll be enough cheese so I don't have to order extra while I was ordering (but since the phone call took too long, the tall blonde girl did my pizza before looking in the trash earlier in #5). I never saw the cashier guy since this point.

7. The old man customer saw me leaning over the barrier-wall with my cheeks in my palms watching them. He came over and did the same cheeks in palms, and complained how it's taking such a long time since he was waiting--who knows when--before I entered the store. 

8. The delivery man came back in the store hurriedly because he saw me get out of the car when he just left. A new man came, and the delivery man pointed and the new man said he's picking up and then the delivery man asked the old man customer his name so that he can look for his order. He got it right away and checked the order, then the man asked my name for my order and got it right away, checked it and I left.

9. When I checked it, it was a bit burnt looking but I wanted to leave soon after getting it. So when I'm home and eating it, I don't know how I feel about eating it. Burnt a bit, and open marinara is showing--I should have ordered extra cheese! So order extra cheese. It also tasted like I bought frozen pizza and put it in my oven even though I saw it made--which is pretty weird.

In total, 9 things happened that seemed off for a food business. Then when I'm on the main domino's site looking where I could put a review or a complaint, there's a video that has a black-hair lady whose hair was not tied or in a net either and I'm like, ""ah, that explains it."" https://pizza.dominos.com/nevada/las-vegas/89118/5355-s-decatur-blvd/

I asked the man if he can fix it and he offered to remake it  which was nice but I was starving and was in a rush. I asked him to throw in some jalapeños and pepperonis on the naked side which he did, but gosh that was a huge mistake.

It was already late and I was tired so I didn't feel like trying to explain my situation over the phone. The chicken wasn't bad at all, I was just set on the cheesy bread.

Overall, dominos is definitely a place I will consider ordering from in the future because their recent company overhaul has really improved the quality of the food.",1PvDk9-siiBuDSt73Jgi-Q,2,0,3,l0SZincm6_ngpkEBLxPRiQ

My household orders dominos once a week and since we moved close to this location (and are not allowed delivery from any other) the food is always INCORRECT! I seriously do not remember getting an order without an issue since I moved here 2 years ago. That would be 104 WRONG ORDERS!

- No sauce that we were charged extra for
- Burnt Items
- 2 HOUR delivery times (not exaggerating)
- Mango Habanero Sandwich with no Mango Habanero Sauce?
- Completely wrong ingredients on pizza (like not even close)

At first I would call and complain, but now its gotten to the point where I just expect the order to be wrong and hope it's at least close to what I want.",cMGCMho5k1c90A7JDGnVDg,0,0,1,5y1QVeks7utznrPkr8BoCg

If you get a chance order their pasta bowls as well. They are fantastic for quick pasta and a surprising change to the usual pizza. 

The only thing I wish they had that they don't are side salads and family size salads as well for a more balanced meal as well as a option for the vegan/vegetarians.

5931596,2018-01-26,0,rd8NXOBTsASiXriuooki_A,"This place has, by far, THEE WORST customer service EVER! I'm a Motel 6 employee and my staff and i always ordered from Dominos with no issues. We get their menus delivered to us so we would send them lots of business as well. NEVER AGAIN!
My coworker and i called in an order for delivery. She ordered a Philly cheese sandwich and i ordered an Alfredo pasta but i don't eat meat so i subbed my chicken for mushrooms. The delivery driver came with the food. He seemed to be a very nice guy. He mentioned that i should check the food to make sure it was right before he left in case they needed him to go back or anything. Almost as if he knew it wasn't right but he said they don't allow him to open the food. So i checked it.
First thing wrong: my mushrooms were missing. Second: my co-workers cheese on her sub was so burned it was black and hard. Third: my pasta was extremely overcooked and was hard and struck to the foil pan it was in. It was only loose and creamy in the center. 
So we tried giving them a chance to rectify the situation. We called back to speak with a manager. He was the rudest person I've ever dealt with. He bluntly told us we were lying about the delivery driver telling us to check the food because ""my driver has no way of knowing you asked for mushrooms,"" he bluntly refused to replace the food, and said he was gonna send the driver back to give the money back. My coworker was so pissed!
I said, let me call back and try to explain. So i did. I told him we send them lots of business, explained that the driver was nice, and just tried to let him know we were hungry and didn't want our money back, just food that tastes right... 
I got the same asshole reaction out of him. So a few minutes later the driver walks back in the lobby, rudely slams the money on the counter top, and before we could tell him we meant no harm, he storms out of the door. 
I don't know what his issue was but if he was gonna act like that he could have returned his tip too!
Needless to say, we will NEVER order from here again and every menu that comes to this property will go directly in the trash. My entire team has an understanding..no more business for them from anyone of our employees... Or guests if we can help it. (Speaking of, a guest came to the front TODAY saying he ordered food that was never delivered. What a sorry staff.)
Dominos, you have a great business and a host of fine establishments. This is not one of them. That manager there gives you all a horrible face for the company.",n6t020f9I0gSOam-DC6K6g,2,0,1,N-F7_z2YkmYA2dzJfjunMQ

The crust is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It tastes like they put way too much garlic powder combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.

The texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer Pizza Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a cheap pizza on the quick.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,1,2,slBwFwhjDy8LAc87LLE5ZQ
