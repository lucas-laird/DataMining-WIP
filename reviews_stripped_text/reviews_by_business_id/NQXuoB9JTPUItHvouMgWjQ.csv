Definitely the place to go if your feeling nostalgic and craving something from before you went vegan. The service is good, everyone I've had as a server has been really nice and attentive.
My favorites include the California dreaming burger, the sassy wings, the southern comfort, and the date me smoothie.",DWWGVrfA5Zsbv4fd8bKKLQ,0,0,5,dF6u6OpBuK94eLvB3Q-xvQ

The first time I went was EXCELLENT service and food quality. I've gone about 5 or 6 times but the last time I went was the Fourth of July. Maybe because it was really busy but I ordered a chili cheese dog, but it came with hardly any chili and the bread wasn't complete. The server had forgotten to bring our drinks which I could tell because she walked to our table and jumped and went to the back and got our drinks.

I do wish they labeled how many calories are in each meal option though. I also wish they would get some EatPastry cookie dough and sell raw cookie dough balls. They could make soooooo much money off those!!! (Even though the desserts they have now are delicious). Anyways, just wanna thank them for making my transition to becoming a vegan that much easier!

261842,2015-05-07,2,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"My fianc√© and I came to Violettes Vegan expecting the same feel as all the other vegan finds in Vegas, an ""OK"" place with a few suggestions of how they could make the food more flavorful.  ""OK"" is an understatement for the experience we had. 

The menu is absolutely vegan, so there is a complete sense of relief that there are no hidden food agendas to enhance the taste. 

The next order of stress for the Vegan is, ""Is this going to be a squirrel portion of gerbil flavored food?""
Every single thing we ordered was delicious and well porportioned; not too much food and not too little. To quote goldie locks it was ""Just RIGHT!"" Yes I know this is a cheesy (but vegan cheesy) read! 

The ambiance is also a 10 with friendly service, whimsical paintings, friendly and attentive staff, and books everywhere for the guest to enjoy at their table. They make fresh smoothies and their desserts are set adorably on display; believe me they are as moist & tasty as they look!

The only tip of advice I would suggest for the staff is to have their menus revised for grammatical errors, and choice of words as sometimes the clarifications on things like 'cheese' V.S. cheese was a bit confusing. But once we were told by the server that despite what the menu says, all of it is dairy/egg/animal free, this became the last thing we were focused on as we were enjoying all the goods! 

We had an overwhelmingly positive experience here. We've been to several vegan friendly themed restaurants here in town, and this one stood out amongst the rest. Treat yourself to a slice of cake! You won't be disappointed. :) :)",-eR4duGaRXE5Ckcg4hKS1A,3,3,5,cInAW01y5dNVyEfwD7vIAQ

The owner came to our table while we were eating, she's a very lovely person. Along the walls are healthy lifestyle books that Violette (the owner) has read throughout her years, and you are free to pick a book and read while you wait for your meal to arrive. 
The place was pretty crowded when we were there, a man was having his birthday party at a table next to mine, and he was reading funny ""over the hill"" humor cards from friends of his out loud... he was only turning 40
Behind the register I saw a colorful chalkboard with varying organic juice recipes that can be made on demand. 

I ate a delicious burrito with rice, beans, vegan cheese, saut√©ed onions and a DELICIOUS tangy (cheese like) sauce with green onion a-top it, served with vegetables (grilled I think) and organic non-gmo purple corn chips. *The burrito was chipotle Size*, It was suggested to me that I share or that I would have leftovers. I finished 5/6ths of it, and shared the rest with my GF. 

My GF got a sandwich on sourdough bread, faux meat that is made from barley wheat, as well as lettuce, avacado and vegan mayonnaise. .. and maybe something else... , IT WAS DELICIOUS. oh yeah, & hers came with organic baked french fries and organic ketchup 

Saying VEGAN or ORGANIC is redundant with these guys, because EVERYTHING is VEGAN and EVERYTHING is ORGANIC ! :) 

It was definitely more expensive than eating at home, but there were:
 
GOOD VIBES
GOOD BOOKS
&

I love the beautiful artwork in the restaurant.  
I ordered the hippie chick burger because I've eaten black bean burgers in the past and enjoyed them. Also it's the safest thing to order at a vegan restaurant in my opinion. 

HIPPIE CHICK BURGER- Delicious burger made with black beans, quinoa, and sunflower seeds. Served with crispy lettuce, tomato, alfalfa sprouts, hemp pesto and mayo on multi grain bun. $12.95
 
I did not enjoy that burger at all. It tasted like mint and cloves on top of my black bean burger. Every time I've eaten a black bean burger somewhere,  they top it with salsa and avocado; so these toppings were not the best combination. Maybe I should've asked for avocado and salsa instead of pesto but I didn't expect it to be that bad. My mom told me to send it back and order something else but we were pressed for time. Also, the blonde waitress forgot my blueberry iced tea,  but I just shrugged it off because there weren't any good beverage options, so I wasn't thrilled about the sound of blueberry iced tea anyway. My sister ordered the Philly and her husband ordered the shinto steak sandwich.  They didn't like their food either.

Let me start by saying, the food here is actually good. I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here and for the most part, you can get a good vegan meal. And its great because there arent many vegan restaurants in Vegas that serve a variety.

But a couple months ago, we noticed a few changes. 1.) They started serving breakfast only on Saturday and Sunday from 10-2. This was really disappointing as they were the only place that served vegan pancakes or breakfast in general anywhere (with the exception of a couple places).  Before they changed their times, we were going there at least once or twice a week. 2.) The prices went up and the quality has changed. Maybe its the cooks or something.

My friend agrees to the cold coffee and was just waiting . Around another 5 minutes pass and our server comes back to tell us the coffee machine is broken . Both servers working looked miserable and did not smile once , and one server looked to have poor hygiene so you're almost scared if she gets too close to your food .

1123283,2016-04-09,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I decided to try it out for the first time on a Friday night. 
I have never eaten at a completely vegan restaurant before, having just moved to Las Vegas recently, so I had no clue what to expect. 
I'm usually the annoying guy at regular at regular restaurants trying to modify everything to my liking. So not having to interrogate the waitstaff, asking if something had any bits of bacon or if they saute it in butter and etc was certainly something I looked forward to.

Food:  I don't know how they make seitan and tofu taste so delicious, but it completely blew me away. The texture of the beef and broccoli I ordered was great, the vegetables tasted very fresh. It was served with a side of corn bread and a butter they obtained from heaven. It was that good!   It's a place you can bring your non-vegan friends to and i'm sure they will really enjoy the foods served here. 

Atmosphere: Everything about the place is captivating, it looks great, the walls are painted with very vibrant colors, tied in with an intriguing decor. The service was very attentive. The people present were incredibly kind and just oozed of positivity. It just looked like everyone present was in such a happy mood, certainly a place I can become a regular at. 

Performance: They had a live performance as well which just brought it all together, they had a young singer that was incredibly talented, it added to the already great vibe of the environment for sure. She seemed incredibly passionate about her craft and was also quite comical at times, making sure everyone was enjoying themselves.

1125518,2015-08-01,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"In Vegas for a vacation and I was hungry and did not have a ride for the day. Didn't feel like dealing with sketchy taxis so I went on yelp for places that deliver. Stumbled upon Violette's and realized I was definitely going to try this place out since vegan/vegetarian places are hard to come by on the east coast. The delivery service was great. I was able to just order online and everything came on time maybe even earlier. There was a $6.99 delivery fee, a small service fee, and driver tip included to the bill so keep that in mind if you want delivery.

Now on to the food! 
I got the small sized nachos, the Teacher's Pet Kids Meal w/ tomato soup, a side order of mac&cheese, the blueberry cheesecake, and the Grateful Greens juice.

Nachos: it was very flavorful. You can't really go wrong with flavor of nachos even if it's vegan. The chips ended up getting soft but that was expected since I ordered it to go. It was no problem, just eat it with a fork like its a bowl from Chipotle! I asked for hot sauce on the side advised by a review I read on here. Turns out the hot sauce they gave were buffalo and sriracha. Both I would never eat with nachos but it was still good.

Teacher's Pet: this is the grilled cheese with a side of fries and green salad. I also got a side of tomato soup for my grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was the BEST grilled cheese I've ever had! It was everything I ever wanted in a grilled cheese. I know, I know ""relax it's just grilled cheese"". No it's perfect! The bread had the right amount of crispiness and butter and there was just enough cheese which was soooo good. It tasted great with the tomato soup but the tomato soup by itself was meh. Needs a little more herbs. The fries were not so great. It already got soggy by the time I opened the container. The salad was alright. Not sure what kind of dressing they put on it but it was very subtle which I liked. It kinda tasted like a creamy hummus.

Mac & cheese: I was pretty disappointed since so many reviews talked about how good this was. I thought because of how much I liked the nacho cheese and the grilled cheese, I would love this as well. I thought wrong. It was very very bland and I didn't taste much cheese. The croutons on top weren't soggy but they weren't crunchy. It tasted stale but it could just be from the contained heat it was in.

Cheesecake: not so sure how I feel with this one. I have always wanted to try vegan cheesecake and was excited to see they had some. But the recipes I would see online were not as wet as the one they sold. The crust was very gooey and sweet. Kinda like thick oatmeal. And the filling itself was just a bit too sweet as well. Agave is very powerful and a little goes a long way.

Green Juice: I love it. Then again I love all fresh juice. I don't like my juice to be super sweet which is why I opt out of getting the fruitier juices.

Overall I'm sure this place tastes a lot better if you were to dine in. I ate everything except for the mac&cheese and was very full but did not have that ""I hate myself"" feeling like if I were to eat nachos, grilled cheese, and cheesecake at a pub. The prices were pretty reasonable as well. Delivery just made it more expensive.",il3Ka4t5AFWjhw5sS-3MdA,6,3,4,nPj1OPp4SW6-uytH0Oegfw

1205961,2017-09-04,2,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Cute place but when you go from cooking all of your raw vegan food at home to eating this type of food, well it's a little rough on your stomach to say the least. 

As excited as I was to use my Yelp check-in offer for a free cup of their house soup, the waitress says to us, ""We had a mushroom eggplant soup, it was SO delicious. But I'm sorry we're all out."" You can imagine the look on my face, right? ?

My friend and I ordered the sassy wings and nachos (vegan junk food) although I'm sure they have much healthier options. When I asked the waitress what ""cheese"" they used for the nachos she said it was a Daiya but they add flour and other ingredients to make it like their own, which in my head all I heard was, ""extra empty calories."" Also, the sassy wings are seitan (wheat gluten) so if you have a gluten sensitivity, stay away from those.

I guess I can talk about a few good things here since I feel like I've been whining like a baby who just dropped their bottle. The atmosphere is colorful, casual and relaxed. The service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our food. 

Since we were already on a roll of being unhealthy vegans for a day, we continued by ordering dessert; vegan, gluten-free carrot cake. It hit the spot although it was a little dry (there I go again, talk about a Debbie downer lol).",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,5,3,3,b3EUTlQVviNHgCidnJLclQ

1235097,2015-10-06,2,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I was excited about this place. Very excited.  All of Las Vegas waited for this new vegan spot to open.  It was so cute and colorful and full of promise.  Then, we actually started visiting.  I'm not sure why I keep going back...probably because I would LOVE to see them succeed.  But, I have yet to have an even remotely positive  experience at Violette's.  Too many reasons to list at this point, but I'll try:

-horrible, inattentive service.  Friendly, but worthless.  Plates and such are left on the table after empty.  They never know what menu items are 86d until AFTER you order...
-the pace is ridiculous.  You will be there forever no matter what you order.
-that's IF they even have what you ordered.  Most of the menu is not available on any given visit.
-often, the price on the menu was different than what printed on the check.
-while the menu seems exciting, everything I've had lacks even minimal salt or pepper.
-inconsistency with items ordered.  A side of avacado, one day, may be a sliced half....another day, a whole avacado just cut in half and served with a knife.
-the hours change CONSTANTLY.  This was the straw that broke that camels back today.  We showed up for breakfast at 1020am to find yet another new sign with new hours posted.  And we were JUST there a few days ago.  So now you have one set of hours on Yelp, another on their voicemail, a set on the front of the building...and now this handwritten note.

Uhhhhh.....is that everything?

I understand making adjustments.  I get that the 1st year of opening a restaurant is very trying.  I do.  I am also the most patient person on the plane, but I've had enough.  It will be many months before I return.

At some point management needs to reach out for help.  They need someone to train the front of house, back of house and tweak the menu.  They need to listen to the complaints that are repetitive.",K_lhMz8z6khuPer0pbZGuQ,17,3,1,wZtQz-A3Kt2LBlxZrvbnGA

I am not vegan but I do eat vegan sometimes because I like to on occasion, however I usually only like the vegan food I cook but this place definitely delivers on flavor.

Grilled vegetables are usually just boring grilled vegetables, and as vegans we can tire of them. You have never have vegetables until you have had them here! Oh my! They came with the biscuits and gravy and I just could not believe how delicious they were! 
The vibe here is awesome and the food and service are so good that thee wait is totally worth it...which is not nearly as long as some reviews make it seem.
Y'all, there are outlets at every table. You have your very own outlet at your table!!!! So when you're ordering nonstop you can charge your device, so you can take pictures of your food! (If you don't excitedly gobble it down, like we did)

1257505,2015-03-26,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"This is an update to my previous review.

Now that Violette's Vegan is open for breakfast, I got the chance this past weekend to go there with my client/friend and we ordered the 'breakfast wrap' and 'gluten free waffle'.

We split the dishes so we could both try a little of each. Wow, they were very good! I was so satisfied, I didn't eat again till 8pm!

I've never had a breakfast wrap before and didn't know what to expect. I was happy to find that it was really delicious and filling. 

The gluten free waffle was great too.  It came with fresh organic fruit and maple syrup, along with some tasty coconut cream topping!  

It was all freshly prepared and made on the spot.  LOVE that about this place.

Next I will be trying the pancakes with blueberries :)

Since I visit violettes vegan A LOT, here are a few of my Fav's:

BREAKFAST: breakfast wrap and waffle (so far)
LUNCH: festive falafel, rockin raw wrap, hippie chick & samurai burger, 
DINNER: 2 burgers above, nachos, buffalo tempeh sticks, curry bowl, taco trio, mash potatoes and gravy. (some lunch items are also on the dinner menu)

DESSERT:
As I'm not 100% vegan, and being brought up eating my grandmothers homemade cakes that were made with eggs and milk, I wasn't sure how a vegan cake would stand up against a regular cake, WELL... Chef Mark continues to amaze me with how divine and delicious vegan cakes actually are!  My fav is the cranberry orange, the others are also incredibly yummy!  Who knew vegan cakes could taste so good?!

I will be back again for breakfast very soon, as well as lunch, dinner and of course dessert, especially as they are tweaking / updating the menus and adding daily specials!",86ij_78wolDsWWwAB1gGFQ,2,1,5,vecHyK2GlFPt80scR1bs2A

We also ordered the California Dreamin Bacon Cheeze Burger and found it just ok. For my kids, I ordered the grilled cheese and they wouldn't eat a bite of it, said the cheese tasted weird.

I went with a group of four last Saturday mid afternoon. I asked initially for a Violette's purple powder smoothie which came with your choice of soy, almond or another choice of milk. When I ordered I completely spaced and didn't directly clarify which I wanted, and she didn't ask... someone in my group over head the worker making my smoothie say ""which milk did she want?"" And our server,blonde olderish lady, made up one which out even clarify.  

When she came back to my table, I asked her what milk was made with my smoothie because I forgot to clarify and her response? ...""Which milk did you want?"" Hmmm... that's not a good response to my question. I had a gut feeling no matter what I said (soy, almond) she would say whichever I said it was made with. 

After that incident she was condescending to my entire group the rest of our visit. At the end of our meal I asked for a second burger Togo, and I cannot joke about this she says ""You want another one?"" With attitude in her voice. I was taken a back and shocked, I'm like "".....Yes, it is for my boyfriend"" 

Needless to say they need to restaff and cut the attitude, won't be back.  

To add, this server overly flirted with all males sitting alone at their table, she popped her bottom out at their table and her chest in their space. Inappropriate to say the least!!",ZixirZyb7Fg6_xAhpYBObQ,1,0,2,VjIltOrYtm7qLYs64tsrfQ

The chili was hearty and meaty. Which is weird to say since it was vegetarian. I'm a meat eater. This totally satisfied me.

THe blueberry hibiscus tea was refreshing and I like the fact that it wasn't sweetened. No artificial sweeteners, they had agave. Excellent!

I ordered the Texas BBQ sandwich and it was so juicy and hearty. The helpings are very generous. Had the fries and they are pretty good. 

My friend had the teriyaki bowl with seitan and I have to say that was even better than my meal! Very generous portion on this also. We ended up taking half our lunches home. 

Lastly I ordered a carrot cake to go and got home and it's, of course, awesome. Was looking forward to the coconut lemon cake but they were all out. Next time I'll have to call ahead to ask them to save a piece as I hear it's the best.

1412190,2015-06-22,2,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Let me start by saying I am NOT a vegan, but the opening of this restaurant intrigued me. I've been here a few of times since it's opened and their biggest flaws only seem to be that they are a new restaurant and need time to get things perfect. 

I took my daughter with me both times (despite her saying that she really doesn't want Vegan food). She's too young to understand Vegan, and I think it's healthy for her to at least understand the different dietary preferences that strongly exist in our modern culture today. 

The first time I went I ordered the Hippie Chick burger. I was a little shocked by how small it was BUT I was so full after I ate it, I was actually glad it wasn't bigger.  I ordered it with mashed potatoes which I wasn't sure I would love, but was pleasantly impressed by!  The gravy was perfectly seasoned and the mash was creamy. I also ordered the Beet Goes On juice. It was delicious!  My daughter ordered a pineapple mint juice but they were out of mint that day, so the server recommended another mixture: pineapple, orange and a little bit of ginger.  She LOVED it and drank it all. For her entree she ordered a kids burrito (No Meato Bandito) which was way too big and she said was very very boring. She packed it up to go but she didn't finish it at home either. 

The next time we stopped in I brought my boyfriend who wasn't really hungry but really wanted a smoothie / fresh juice. He ordered 2 smoothies to try: Amazon Rocket Fuel and Green Lava.  I loved both of them.  Haven't found a disappointing drink selection on the menu yet. Hi-five!  

For my entree I had the teriyaki tofu bowl (Love Bowl), which didn't taste anything like teriyaki to me.  It was still good, but not great.  I don't think I will order that dish again.  My daughter ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, which she said was good, but she hardly made a dent.  Their kids portion sizes are really big.  She took it home, but again didn't finish it.  I prefer kids portions to be just enough.  It's hard for them to eat leftovers when the rest of the family doesn't have left overs as well.

I stopped in for my 3rd try tonight. I was dining solo so I walked in the door and stood there for a minute before any of the staff noticed me. A girl behind the counter said ""hi..."" and I signaled at her that I was dining alone (party of 1). She nodded at me but left me there standing while the rest of the restaurant stared at me. Awkward!  She disappeared to the back for a minute and thought she was possibly going to find another staff member to help up front, but instead came out with 2 plates which she delivered to the table I was standing next to (still waiting to be seated). She dropped the food off to them, asked if they needed anything else, and then walked to the back again. After those 5 awkward minutes, I left. If a half full restaurant means I won't even be seated, I don't think I'll be waited on with any urgency.  I guess I'll be back again another time. For now, overall rating is a 3.5, with a heavy weighing on tonight's experience of not even being seated.",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,8,4,3,w2htVjynsgDKzB4QpbKqWw

1431413,2015-06-26,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I really wanted to love this place. I can justify to myself giving the 3 stars since for the most part the food was good -The bean & corn salad on the side was very good.  I appreciate that they hand make the gluten-free wrap for their teriyaki wrap but it was a little soggy from the sauce in the wrap so we had to use a knife and fork to eat the wrap. Plus I think the tortilla could have been cooked a bit more since it was quite thick & very doughy in the center This may have been because it was still early when I ordered it at 11:20 and their lunch menu doesn't start until 11:30. So I was forewarned that the wrap might take a little extra time and it was served at 11:40. What we did not expect was that his waffle that was ordered at 11:20 would not be served until we had finished the wrap. We shared the wrap so I wouldn't have to eat in front of him or wait for it to get cold waiting for his waffle to be served. Great idea since his breakfast waffle was not served until 11:55!!! So gad he ordered the waffle & not a savory breakfast dish, so we could treat it like a dessert But I rechecked the menu & yes there was supposed to be coconut cream on it so I went up to the server at the register to ask about the cream. ""Oh, it wasn't on there? Maybe they were out so they didn't put it on. But I can check for you"" Okay so that answer did not impress me, but it got worse, she continued to look confused at the register for 5 minutes, then served another table their food, took another table's order, gave a 3rd table (that had come in after us& was served before us) their check & then change, went back to confused look at register & then was heading over to clear the table she gave the check and change to when she must have overheard my guy's comment to me so 10 minutes after my requesting the cream, decided to go into the kitchen to get some. Of course by that time we only had a few bites of waffle left & the syrup had already completely soaked in so no clue what the waffle would taste like hot & fresh with all the fixings. 
SO, the 3-stars for the attempt at good food that was not up to par because of really poor service. I may try this place again - if it is still open in a few months when they have had a chance to get the service issues fixed. Sad because I was looking forward to liking this restaurant with it's good reviews & that it is all vegan but I don't always have an hour for a quick bite.

1478622,2015-03-21,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Very excited to see some vegan comfort food making its way to Vegas. For those of you, like me,that visit LA regularly and crave Native Foods and Real Food Daily this is the closest runner up yet to these types of foods. I celebrate this opening happily!

My first visit I tried the REUBEN and potato salad. Flavored were there and the tempeh bacon was delicious. I would recommend improving the bread quality and then I'd give it an A. Also they seem skimpy with the bacon which was the best part. 
Also tried the Mac and cheese. Huge portion on the side order and while i loved it, I think it was extremely bland for the normal palette . Maybe needed a bit more nooch? Also crumble up the bread crumbs on top more. Weird as big dry cubes in top. Nice and creamy texture. 
Dessert!!!! The choc cake was unreal!! So moist and delicious. A must have. Better than Red Velvet Cafe imo. 

Next day I went back for more......
Got the hippy chip burger and a club sand. Probably won't try them again. Nothing special. But that bacon rocks!! 
Lots more of menu items to try!!! Including breakfast, finally!!!
Oh and the Potato salad in awesome!! Creamy and great crunch from onions and celery. 

Cons:
Day one I tried to order the nachos and they said they were out of guac. Really? Smiths is in the same shopping center and it was only about 2pm. Buy some avocados!
Day 2: ordered a samurai burger to go and was told it was my lucky day because they had one left. When I got there I was told they were wrong. Offered the hippy chick burger instead which was tasteless mush. :(
Day 1&2:
Disappointed that the menu says choc cake has walnuts and choc chips on it but both times no walnuts. Told that the pic on yelp may have just been for show! Lol. Throw some friggin walnuts on it! The menu says it!",DcEt50i1wi9UPfEw7A5g3w,1,0,4,FvXdRWh0Ytn_fH6bnZl8iw

I have since been messaged not once but twice by management and ownership to remove my pictures (and the review was hinted at, too) because the dishes ""are no longer on our menu."" I spoke to another Yelper who said she'd also been contacted about removing photos of an order that was visually unappealing. Don't let it come out of your kitchen if you aren't proud of it!

It's been quite some time since my last visit, and I've incorporated more meatless meals into my diet- so I came back for the amazing-looking Nature Girl salad. You'll notice my photo looks nothing like others posted, and I'm not taking it down. That's what I was served. 

I called in my order and was told it'd be ready in about 10 minutes. I showed up in 15, and then waited an extra 5 for it to be ready. From the looks of it, they waited until I showed up to assemble it. There were no sprouts or tempeh bacon, and the dressing was flavorless. I realize presentation isn't going to be on par when you opt for takeout, but this was a half-assed salad. I enjoyed the herbed tofu and the plethora of nuts, but was extremely disappointed with the salad I received versus what others have had.

I'm vegan but there is no need for you to be because the healthy food here tastes absolutely phenomenal.  My wife was looking for a salad place and I had always wanted to try this since it opened.  She got her salad and lots more!  The appetizer was guacamole and chips - a favorite of hers.  I like comfort food.  How about the aptly named ""Violette's Southern Comfort"" entry?  Collard greens and onions, tempeh that looked and tasted like chicken fried steak (!), and a large bowl of mac and cheeze to boot.  The dessert list was awesome too!  I was so full that I could only opt for the two scoops of ice cream (tofu based or almond based).  We had the tofu based and it was great.  It's comforting to know that Violette's is GMO-free and Organic among a whole list of other healthy attributes.  Violette's is definitely only two $$!  Unusual for such a healthy restaurant, and my wallet thanks you!  Our two entrees where $15 and $10 and the ice cream was $3.  If there is knock, unlike my other two favorites, the location is on Desert Inn and Durango which is too far for me to go for lunch as I work on The Strip.  The good news personally, is that it is relatively close to my house so that I anticipate having a lot of meals there before work or on days off.",QHnV9FesYBP_aPcpEDyRGQ,1,0,5,bAzj7MQAvzjCc2dKnb5ezw

This is a great organic and Non-GMO restaurant that combines the foods you've known and loved growing up, just in a vegan version.

Pros:
- Their regular/baked cheese cake is so good that I savor every bite (I can't even tell it's vegan)
- Their waffles and pancakes are absolutely delicious (I leave feeling happy)
- The food is top notch and the owner Cindy is such a kind and giving woman (love her to death) :-)
- They let me teach essential oil classes every Saturday at this location so they are definitely into health and wellness!

Cons:
- The noise level can be a little loud with the blender and smoothie going at times (hard to hear conversations)
- Some food items could use a little more flavor like the hummus (but they are still tasty)

Final Verdict:
- This is a must-visit location if you are a local or if you are visiting Las Vegas. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and there's a reason why I go here every week (it's so awesome!) :-)",s1DTIKX-ZXcQOMDlcOI6Tg,3,2,5,BfYMOSamGGtGmCdbL89eRQ

Update: I've been in several times (both for takeout and dine-in) since my last review and the service was awesome!! Food was amazing as always and the breakfast menu looks really good, can't wait to try it.",QuWicSJGHOIyA9dtuzchRw,0,0,5,Sx7BQ7khHsFnu_HGcDugkQ

1817045,2015-04-19,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"We've been to Violette's 3 times now, each on a Sunday morning for breakfast, so this review is strictly based on this specific day and course. 
Firstly, thank you so much for opening a vegan restaurant in Las Vegas, it's amazing to see so many options starting to open here in town. 
But based on our experiences, I don't know that I'll be back again. To start, and this is strictly my personal style opinion, the restaurant decor is straight out of the 90's...earthy peace-loving theme, kind of hippie meets vegan feel. It doesn't feel modern at all, it feels like an old tired cafe. 
Secondly, as far as breakfast goes, the food is just ok. I'd like to see them not use so many processed meat/cheese substitutes like Fieldroast sausage and Daiya, I could make this food at home better. I would also like to see a better side to some of the breakfast options other than steamed kale. I like kale but plain steamed kale isn't very appetizing or tasty in the morning, it's also not creative at all. 
Third, and most important, every time we've visited they have been out of something. It's been muffins, mint, pineapple and tofu...Yes, tofu! They ran out of tofu scramble today! Which is really odd since there is a Vons in the plaza! 
Lastly, the service is mediocre. Servers are friendly but unknowing of what items are currently not available, again there always seems to be something out of stock here. The preparation time it takes to make your food order is quite long. Is there only one person in the kitchen who is still trying to figure things out? 
Again, I'm happy for a west side vegan restaurant but based on service and creativity, in both decor and food, I will most likely drive downtown for Sunday morning brunch from now on.",q4ZoIarjsy86gCzKQ1sK1g,4,0,2,3RVrYIFsqs1rBecdqdDgIA

I ordered the tomato bisque soup and the burrito entree.  I have to be honest when I say the burrito wasn't so amazing., I totally understand that vegan food is a little different than regular.  But as a vegan restaurant that specializes in that sort of thing I expected the food to be a little better.  Way too much rice smothered in the burrito.  But the restaurant itself was super cute.",-SG08MJPzUH75Q3cUNUlRg,1,1,4,wf8NLapAAhFN5A2qAB_h_g
1845354,2018-01-03,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Update for earlier review:    They have since changed the El Toro Grande Burrito entree.  The meal traditionally includes a fairly sized burrito, corn chips, grilled veggies, guacamole, and salsa.   This is for the whopping price of $15!  Now, they cut the veggies and substituted them with lettuce.  Literally pieces of lettuce. In addition, they removed the guacamole and and salsa. But the funny thing is they didn't lower the price at all.  And the menu didn't display any of these changes.  I think they instituted these changes to save money and inventory, but it was a poor choice.  

P.S. Make the cauliflower bites larger or add more!  Veggie Grill in California gives you huge cauliflower bites for a dollar less!  We love your food but sometimes the portions are small for the price.  Much love",sdB_jqeGGQOIjEh-4NaMhg,1,0,4,jDdfJ2nLq90hxsQLFBnCwg

We ordered off of the breakfast menu. I ordered chocolate chips pancakes with a side of tofu scramble, potatoes, and a sausage patty. All of it was delicious. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the sausage patty but everything else was yummy in my tummy.
The second time I went back, I brought my best friend along. We arrived during lunch hours so I ordered the vegan eggplant parmesan with spaghetti which included a side of broccoli. It was mouth watering. I could eat it again and again. 

If you live in Las Vegas or are visiting, I definitely recommend that you stop by and grab a bite. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy the fantastic food at Violet's Vegan. It's hard to believe that all this delicious food is vegan.",uepq44B_7tMGEeVX2hxM6w,1,1,4,SZCv-xkdqrbzttWORbdxug

We called ahead to see how long it would be as the Yelp reviews say the wait may be long. They lady in the phone said 20 minutes. When we get there, the place is full but everyone is done eating. We sit at the bar area and nobody acknowledges us. We grab menus on our own since they are next to us. 15 minutes before someone gets out drinks. Then, once we get out drinks another 20 minutes until I flag down a man and tell him we are ready and that it's been 20 minutes. We place our order and the man tells me they are out of their homemade veggie patties but they can sub with a soy patty. Sure. Then he comes back and tells my wife they are out of the beef and broccoli she ordered. She then chooses a sandwich. Then, he comes back and tells me they don't ha e a soy patty for my sandwich! At this point, I'm so frustrated with they place I don't want to order another item. So we tell them to forget it we don't want to eat here anymore and we will pay for the drinks.

Service is decent. That goes for backhouse/ kitchen, which I'll explain in a bit, and the front of the house. The times I've went the servers have been helpful with recommendations. But tonight I tried to order a smoothie for pick up and was given an excuse that the staff who normally makes the drinks called off and that she didn't know how to make any of the juices/ smoothies.. I thought this to be quite interesting. Being a server/ food handler myself I would think the management would want you to know everything about the menu and how it's made. But anyways..
I've ordered the same things over and over, cheese cauliflower, tofu buffalo sticks, violettes purple power, green lava, and the coconut lemon cake. All were very tasty and actually quite good. I was impressed with the smoothie and cake for sure. 
But tonight when I got my buffalo tofu sticks they were literally thrown into a box. No presentation like the last time i ordered it (with celery sticks and foil underneath to help with the buffalo sauce). My cheese baked cauliflower tonight was also extremely disappointing!!! Seriously I don't even think it was baked/cooked. It definitely did not look nor taste the way it did when I ordered it the first time... 
CONSISTENCY of the quality of the food and service will definitely help better this place. Your workers from the front to the back of the house need to care about that.. 
Anyways this restaurant is definitely not one of my constant ""go tos"", but I guess here and there it will be an option. 
From the looks of the comments, your customers hope to see more improvements.

I've been sick in bed so I ordered over the phone and had my boyfriend pick it up. I ordered the samurai burger platter, the raw cheesecake, and the castaway smoothie. The lady I spoke to made the cheesecake sound convincing and mentioned that there is fresh fruit on top. My boyfriend brought me the food and there was no smoothie. I ate the burger and it was actually delicious. I don't eat red meat anymore so it was nice to have an alternative. It came with fries that were soggy, and a bit oily. I open the box of raw cheesecake and it seems melted and had no fresh fruit on it. I ate it anyways, and to my surprise, it was really yummy. I called to complain about the service and also mention that the food was really good (lol) while my boyfriend went to grab my smoothie. When he came back he told me that they made it fresh so I take a sip and it isn't very cold. It was closer to room temperature but the flavor was good. I just wish it was cold. They gave him a 10% off card for next time which was a nice gesture, but the service needs to be improved. I do have to say that they have a lot of potential considering that the food is delicious but they just need more accurate service even for to go orders.

1979492,2015-04-25,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I was very eager for Violette's Vegan to open ever since, about years ago, I saw a sign on a storefront near the intersection of Tropicana & Decatur saying it was coming soon. When it finally did come to fruition at a different location I had to check it out. Since then I have been three times once each for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
My first visit was for dinner.  My friend and I shared a order of nachos. They were good, although we did not care for the sour cream as it didn't really taste like anything. I ordered the Texas Hold 'Em quesadillas which I liked and my friend ordered a stew made out of tofu, seitan, and tempeh. She said that it was good, but did not care for the side or kale as it wasn't flavorful. She tried adding some salt, but the grinder at the table just left chunks of salt so she could not eat it. For dessert I had the chocolate cake and she had apple pie. Neither one of us were impressed with the desserts.
     I checked on line to see what time they opened for lunch and arranged my errands around the  11:00 time. When I arrived a piece of paper had handwritten hours taped over the sign on the window, saying lunch started at 11:30. I asked the server and she said they didn't start serving lunch until 11:30. I told her that online it said 11:00, she just smiled (in a snarky manner if you ask me) and replied ""11:30"". I was just telling them so they knew as a lot of people check on line before coming to a place. I returned later and ordered the BBQ seitan sandwich with a side or cole slaw. After about 20 minutes the server informed me they were all out of cole slaw. I was the first person there for lunch, so it seemed they didn't have any as opposed to having run out. The sandwich tasted good, but the seitan was very tough. Like, you couldn't bite through it when you tried to take a bite of the sandwich and it fell out each time. 
     My last visit was for breakfast. I arrived at 9:00 and sat outside as they still had the closed sign up and tables and chairs were spread out as they cleaned. At one point an employee came outside on his cell phone saying ""The place is a mess!"" and quickly went inside when he saw me. After about 10 minutes I peaked my head inside and ask if they would be opening soon. They told me they were open (the closed sign was still up). I ordered the scrambled tofu, sausage, and cheese on an English muffin. As I waited they continued to clean. The overwhelming smell of bleach from the mop bucket was a bit too much at times. Twenty minutes later (I was the only customer all of this time) a BLT arrives. I call over the server and ask her if it is a BLT and she replies, ""Um, it looks like it"". I reminder her I didn't order a BLT and she says what I d order. So, she didn't check it before bringing it out. She did stop backtrack o apologize and ask if I wanted a muffin. Another 20 minutes go by and my correct order comes out. The food was good, but not remarkable.
     I gave a three star rating because my over all opinion of the place is okay. The food is alright, nothing spectacular. The servers are okay, with the exception of my lunch time experience, they are nice enough, but not overly friendly or attentive even. Every visit I've seen other customers having issues with something being out or not served at this time as well.  I'd really like to see them iron out the issues and be successful.

The bean/corn salad remains tasty. I could eat a gallon. I had a simple salad with a chipotle lime dressing. Like all the ingredients here, the salad has the freshest of ingredients. Lettuce has that lovely crispiness that makes it good. The dressing has a kick. I mean that in a good way. There were perhaps a few too many chick peas for my taste. The coconut cake was ok, the everything cookie outstanding. Make sure you get their apple pie, which is the best tasting dish on the menu and among the best pieces of pie, I have EVER eaten. Many of my complaints from a prior review were fixed. I did not order any juice, but I can tell you, I saw to go covers. I am optimistic about my next visit. Healthy meals make for a better day.

Upon arriving, there was a sign to self seat and so we did. We grabbed menus at the entrance and as we were excitedly looking through them, the server told us that menu was only for dinner. She then gave us the breakfast menu and as we were looking through them for a good 5 minutes, she took away the ""special"" page and told us that was only for weekends. Okayyyy.... So why is it in the menus? Why not hand them on the weekends then. Weird but no big deal. 

Now that we can't order some of the things we thought we can, we continue to look through our other options. As I was looking, a whole cup of ice water poured all over me. It would have been refreshing if I was on a hike in the Vegas heat but I was sitting under a AC vent blasting cold air at me while this shocked the F out of me. She pretty much did the ALS challenge on me.  It got all over my LV handbag, the right side of my body and my butt. She said sorry and handed me a towel to clean up. After that it was as if nothing happened. I felt no sincere apology or any acknowledgement.  I would have walked out but my family looked hungry so I stayed and ordered my meal. 

Check came with no apologies. After the server charged my card, she gave me a tiny piece of carrot cake to said this is for spilling water on you.  What if was coffee or juice? That was poorly handled. I'm glad it didn't happened to my son and on me instead. She pretty much did the ALS challenged on me.  My stuff which cost more than a little piece of carrot cake was soaked and my bag has water damage. I had to walk out with a cold wet butt.",GXMln_X82wMm-Q7SYJ5ByQ,9,2,1,QzpAH-eHWKKRrn3_QAwa5g

I got the samurai burger & it wasn't bad 
but the bad rating isn't for the food. It's for the horrible service. 
I walked in & I was waiting at the cash register for 15 min! (While workers were walking pass me) I finally had to speak up and get their attention. So a employee with a very bad attitude decides to finally help me. 
I order the samurai burger & the worker has the audacity to tell me ""oh by the way we don't do the whole medium, medium-rare thing here. It's all vegan""
Ummmm...why would she automatically assume that I thought it was a actual hamburger. I felt like that was rude because I mean...in big letters, its say ""vegan restaurant"" on the sign...I'm not stupid & not only that I read the menu.. I've been to other vegan restaurants and they've never made a statement like that. 
So I was very irritated by that comment!Plus the vibe in there is so judgmental! So it made it 10x worse. 
So it takes about 30 mins for my food to be done & I couldn't have been any more happy to get out of that place.

2456221,2016-07-03,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I was very disappointed when I came here, only because I'm both gluten free and vegan. I was visiting Las Vegas for a convention and was excited to see this place has options that are both gluten free and vegan. Looking at the online menu, it reads as though their nachos are all made gluten free. It also has a picture of some killer nachos. I decided this was going to be my first choice of restaurants to visit based on the online menu. When I went to the restaurant, their physical menu had a note that the nachos could be made gluten free but did not come that way. Turns out the gluten free nachos did not have the delicious liquidy nacho cheese sauce pictured on their website. They just use Daiya by itself for the gluten free version. Daiya doesn't melt well, and if I wanted nachos with Daiya, I could make them at home. I took a $20 uber over to this restaurant just to get those nachos because I was under the impression they were gluten free. 
So, I decided to get my second choice, I forget the name but it's essentially buffalo wings. Turns out they were out of that menu item. At this point I honestly wanted to leave, but I was starving. I ordered breaded zucchini and decided to try them with ranch. The ranch dressing was solid like cream cheese and didn't have much taste, I have no idea how that is put onto a salad. The zucchini sticks themselves were really delicious, they were cooked perfectly. If they were all I had wanted and eaten I'd give five stars. But even the tomato dipping sauce was bland. 
I'm mostly disappointed because I feel the online menu is misleading about which items are always gluten free vs can be prepared gluten free. If I had only looked at the online menu before ordering the nachos, I would have thought I was ordering gluten free, and I would have gotten very sick.",TpnHNJTYXD-gnabZPiv6-Q,3,2,3,eEfKwM-ZueKwbQ56nMkK6Q

Tastes like cheap bar food.

Nachos were lacking major flavor and heat. Just because a dish is vegan doesn't mean it has to be bland. 

Seriously, everything we ate, I could make better at home with more flavor and still be vegan and healthy. Was expecting more creative items on the menu but left bloated and unsatisfied. 

Was so excited based on the reviews and left disappointed. I don't want to go out and pay for food that I can make better at home. 

I'm also comparing this to Veggie Grill and Native Foods - so much better but we don't have those in Las Vegas. Ugh.",--ZNfWKj1VyVElRx6-g1fg,3,0,2,KdRFp9O9Lz2vEChmjfZijg

Well I came across this Gem of a place and boy they don't disappoint. so my first impression when I walked in was it kind of reminded me of a hippie Style restaurant you would find in Humboldt County.. obviously dog friendly and you can sit outside in these cute umbrella cover tables and there's water bowls for your fur babies. Inside is is how I explained as hippie style to me. Servers and staff were very friendly.. the guest were a mix of business, regular Folk, hippie style Folk, folks that didn't seem like they would eat this food. Just every Walk of Life was here. Kind of refreshing to see. I started off with the energy shot. Taste like lemon grass. The grassy taste was an overwhelming and it tasted more lemony than anything. Kind of had a grassy aftertaste. But it wasn't horrible and it went away pretty quickly. I then ordered the California Dreamin because always looking for a good burger without meat or dairy. The burger comes out and it looks like a cheeseburger. I thought well let's see how it taste. I got to say it was a pretty damn good cheeseburger. Funny thing is that it's vegetarian. No meat or cheese. I would eat it even if I wasn't on a plant-based diet. A good cheeseburger is good no matter how you look at it and to have it healthy also is win-win to me. The the french fries sus like any other fries awesome as usual. The ranch dressing was pretty awesome for the dipping. Buffalo sauce was good too. I also ordered dessert. I ordered the baklava. It was pretty good A little more cinnamon and chewy then I like but it was good. but the star of the show was that cheeseburger as it should be. It was tasty, filling, and to know that it was good for me. Violette's vegan gets two thumbs up for me. It's a little more pricey I think it was like 14 bucks for the burger and fries but he'll it was worth it. I would recommend this place to anybody.. and I mean anybody.

Filled with rice and veggies, served with chips and side vegetables topped with cheese. No seasoning whatsoever, completely bland. Ended up in the garbage after I took a bite. 

You're better off eating at Madhouse Coffee in the same complex that offers vegan dishes that have actual flavor. Or head further down on Spring Mountain to Veggie House.

Then it takes about 40 minutes to get our food. When I approached our server with what the status is, he states the mac & cheese dish take about 20 minutes so that's why it's taking so long. Not once did he come to our table to ask if we would like more water ( which we did need ) or if we wanted our main dishes ( which were already ready according to him ). No customer service at all. Never coming back that's for sure.",MZL8xIfJ0LYNxrEvtRVj-Q,5,0,1,IYC6amGFyRL0k4EuRCM5TQ
2822555,2016-07-06,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"A friend of mine and I decided to catch up at Violette's Vegan, and we had such a wonderful time. 

We shared a side of the mac n' cheeze and each had different sandwiches for our meals, and we were both very pleased. I would easily satisfy my skeptical vegan friends with that mac n' cheeze for sure. They didn't bat an eye when I wanted to drink out of my own glass (because in the summer heat, I take my glass jar with me everywhere to avoid plastic melting into my cups and such), and they even refilled it for me (which probably doesn't sound that impressive, but lots of restaurants won't do it--so I rarely even ask--because it's considered uncool to bring in your own drink, not that my water cup is a different price from their water cup). 

What's more, they didn't seem at all bothered that we hung out there for quite a while, which is vital to me in a restaurant because many of my friends are from Europe, where you would never be rushed out of a cafe. Lunch is SUPPOSED to take two hours!

But really, the vibe was amazing. Not only did we have a super satisfying lunch, but we were able to really enjoy our time there. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. I also noticed that the bathroom was super chic, and the decor around the cafe was energetically on point. I read some of the hangings and found a couple quote gems from the Dalai Lama, which was awesome. 

I will definitely head back to try their fresh juices and raw menu now that I'm attempting a transition to 80/10/10 raw vegan. I'm super psyched that they even had the options.

2876809,2018-02-27,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Never in a million years would I think that I would actually enjoy vegan food. I've been to vegan food places but that's only because some of my friends are vegan so I just tag along and order whatever sounds or looks good. My friend and I were just hanging out and we were trying to figure out a place to eat and offered a vegan option. He suggested to me Violette's and I asked him if it was any good as I'm not a big fan when it comes to vegan food and he told me that it's a really good place for breakfast / brunch. So we ended up going here and the place was packed outside and inside so that's a good sign. Upon entering there's a sign that tells you to seat yourself. Upon looking at the menu I was actually quite surprised how delicious the items sounded. I ordered the Violette's Rise N' Shine off the special section of the menu which really surprised me. It came with ""eggs,"" ""sausage,"" potatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower. We also ordered some nachos which came with black beans, guacamole, vegan cheese and vegan sour cream. Yes, you heard me right, vegan sour cream and vegan cheese. Never would I have thought that I would enjoy vegan food and would definitely come back. Only downside was that the staff was not attentive at all and took about 15 minutes just for a server to come to us.

Fun fact: check in and you get a free bowl of the soup of the day.

Also a cool fact: You get free coffee.

Overall I would never think I'd like vegan food and if you're contemplating on whether or not to try vegan food I'd say definitely give Violette's a chance as it is extremely good especially the nachos. I will definitely be coming back.",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,2,2,4,aVrdOUm5lF-sj3yGj72txQ

We ordered our dishes to go and after 20 minutes, she went to the kitchen to find out what was taking so long (before the kitchen door shut, her shouting started). 

Everything was packaged very neatly. We ordered Zucchini Zen Sticks, the Philly with French Fries, California Dreamin' Bacon Cheeze Burger with Mac N' Cheeze, and dessert. Mind you this is for two people heading back to Orange County; this is our road trip food to last us thru traffic.

We paid at the counter and the server kept apologizing for the wait. We were not in any hurry but she was kind to acknowledge the wait.

The smoothies are made fresh and to order. Some of the sweets are outsourced which is fine. I think it is great to promote other vegan businesses. The staff is friendly and do a good job of taking your order quickly and efficiently.

I LOVE their selections and varieties for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The biscuits and gravy are delicious! I also had the watermelon lemonade that was very refreshing. But the Sunrise Superman was to die for. You gotta try this! 

What didn't quite make sense to me was that they sell their used books for the same price they are priced originally for. For me, this doesn't make sense because 1. They're used. 2. I can get a BRAND NEW one for the same exact price at Barns and Noble. I even picked a few up to look at them and there was marker in many of the pages in one in particular. Half price definitely seems more reasonable. The wait for our food is one other minor disappointment. My Parents and I came here around 10am. There was only one other table at that time and maybe 1 guy at the bar, but by 10:45/11am it was pretty busy for just one waitress, like I mentioned, we got there around 10am but we didn't leave until 12pm because of the wait for our food. Our waitress however did do a great job and juggling everything being the only person out there. She actually engaged with us and advised us of what's popular, as well as her favorites. She also came to apologize about the hold time. This means a lot to me because I've been many places were people don't apologize or show empathy to the unforeseen lack of service. I appreciated that and her upbeat personality throughout our visit. There was never an ""idk"" answer. I  will be coming back for lunch next! :)

The Decor reminds me of a small cafe by the beach in Carlsbad... It's colorful and calming... Every table has an outlet... Which is perfect if you want to take a working lunch break or study... 

The service is pretty good... Lots of friendly smiles. Menus and water are always delivered in a timely manner and the food always comes out quickly. 

The food... I've tried the hippie chick burger (flavorful and exceptional... One of my favorite vegan burgers ever)... The nachos (I'm not a nacho person but they were good and full of all the nacho fixens)... the zucchini sticks (definitely good and crunchy but I'm not a fried finger food person), the Mediterranean dinner (amazing! And had everything a girl in the mood for Greek could ask for), the raw wrap (my favorite thing ever! Pesto was on point!!) the salads (all super fresh and crispy and large for sharing)... The black bean salad (I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but it was really great flavorful and savory!)... The buffalo French fries (okay so I had only 1 off my friends plate because if I had any more I knew I wouldn't be able to stop eating them!)

Let's start with the good:
* The gluten-free waffles are GREAT! They have a coconut whipped cream on them! And with butter, syrup, and bananas, I've SMASHED these down a few times! 
* The sausage seitan is a hands down winner. 
* The corn chowder is some of the best I've ever had.

Now the bad...
* The country classic... super disappointing. And the tempeh part of it was flat out gross. Tasteless potatoes. The greens weren't flavorful either. Yuck.
* The coffee has never been good. And I'm perfectly happy with the pump coffee from Whole Foods coffee bar with some soy milk.
* Dry cornbread. Unless that's your thing.
* Bacon tempeh isn't good at all

The restaurant itself is cute and relaxing. Painted with bright colors.

The waitresses I've had feel more like nice girls getting your food than skilled waitresses who are on top of customer service. And I've had that kind of customer service at a few other vegan places. Almost as though being a hipster/trendy dressed vegan is enough to work at a place like this.

THE BURGER. Ok.. so I've had lots of veggie type burgers in my time but I believe this place had one of the best ones.

Although I give this place 4 stars, I subtracted a whole star because I would love to see this establishment separate themselves from the majority of restaurants in the world and start providing Alkalized (alkaline ionized water), which is completely different from alkaline water, which has plentiful more health benefits!   And since they provide healthy food, they should provide healthy water too!  
If you rinse produce with Alkalized water, it will remove the oil based pesticides off of produce (organic or gmo) and this will bring out the true flavors of your foods.

FYI:  Alkaline water stays alkaline for only up to 48 hours when bottled, so don't waste your money on alkaline bottled water.  It takes weeks if not months from factory to retail shelves.

I tried the Hippie Chick Burger, the quesadilla and carrot cake, plus an Alkaliner, a smoothie with carrot juice, ginger and coconut water.

While it was a tad after lunch hour, it was still pretty busy and the staff seemed pretty overwhelmed, because the smoothie bar was slow to provide my order and I waited for 23 minutes for the food.

The Hippie Chick Burger has a nice texture, but the bun is unremarkable and burger is bland, being far surpassed by the much more reasonably priced black bean burger at Freddy's Custard, which has great seasoning. I did really like the seasoning on the quesadilla and my side order of potato salad.
Carrot cake was just ok and maybe this is why they have to rave about it when you order.
The alkaliner smoothie was nothing to write home about, except for the splash of cayenne in the watery carrot juice.
I was not overly thrilled with the customer service but this could have been the busy hour. 
The person at the cash register gushed about the carrot cake, and sure was quick to do a little up-sell to get me thinking about a smoothie (and I heard her do the same to others). 
If I state an order, as an adult of advanced age, I know exactly what I have chosen, but I was feeling generous and agreed to the Alkaliner.

When you enter, you can only see the list of drinks on the boards. I asked for a menu and a young woman at the register told me the menu is all online.
It took a few minutes to have our discussion evolve with this rather clueless young person to her actually handing me a menu to review.

I much prefer to have more eye contact and a welcoming feeling, whereas it seemed to be the customer who should show gratitude for being here... Hmmm I found a weird vibe in general.

This cafe does not compare, in my opinion, to the other V restaurant which is so popular and which makes you feel genuinely appreciated in the downtown and Henderson locations.

I acknowledge that my high expectations were dashed. I really went in wanting to like the experience, but after years of my having taught and having provided superior customer service, I am disappointed.

I  would probably try going back, to give Violette's the chance to spruce up their customer care, but I am not racing back...just yet.",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,4,2,3,epWveK6jiJGUq8L-H1e_JA

Lots of variety. Creative menu. Might turn off those with inflexible and limited palates. But my wife and I loved the variety. Plenty to non conventional burger choices. 

Main reason we chose it is because the quality of food. All organic. Sure it costs more but well worth it. You can feel the difference in the taste. Imagine top quality food that tastes exceptional. Unbeatable combination. Of course, we love shopping at Whole Foods and love Organic Foods to begin with so perhaps we are biased. It's easy to get used to the run of the mill food. Rare to find a restaurant committed to real quality. Most of the restaurants that make that commitment don't seem to be able to make a profit and go out of business. I sure hope that doesn't happen with this one. 

We loved their fresh vegetable juice blends. They are a meal in and by themselves. 

We indulged in the lemon coconut cake. So smooth. It was well worth it. Delicious. I would go back just for that treat alone. 

We are also impressed with the d√©cor. Great blend of bright colors. The art hanging on the wall was certainly a conversation piece. 

Even if you're not a vegetarian it is well worth visiting. Open your mind and your taste buds and you will be pleasantly surprised. The experience made us give serious consideration to becoming committed vegetarians.",EwusKgVPgEPPTuVClovwgg,1,1,5,HCVXfwg2VGHLvpuJJT9Xmw

1. Over-priced- For what the food is, it should definitely not be over $10 a plate.  It was pretty basic food. As crazy as it sounds, I didn't find passion, love, or creativity in their food. 
2. No character- Considering every aspect of the restaurant, it was all too bland. They had a lot of Latin inspired dishes (ok, maybe just names) that had no authenticity.The interior and set up they had was i guess bohemian or as my friends would say ""hippyish"" I would think that for a new vegan joint, they try to do something more out of the ordinary. 
3. Fair cleanliness- For cleanliness to be on the fair side is pretty bad in my book. *The menus and Table were a bit worn out and dirty. Not too noticeable.. until you examine them. 
*The women's bathroom was ok, just a dirty floor. My friend said that the men's bathroom was trashed. Paper's all over the floor, dirty mirror, floor, and sink. 
*There was a hair in our food. I honestly would have taken it out and still eaten it, (knowing that they were just going to throw out the food, is a waste to me) but my friend was disgusted and sent it back. When the waitress carried it back to the kitchen, we noticed the kitchen staff had long beards and dreads. Which there is NOTHING wrong with, just keep extra watch on the food. 

I honestly was disappointed and I know there should be a second chance given. Of course to support local vegan restaurants, I most likely will.

3487701,2017-06-17,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"While a group of us were in town for the week, last month, one of the girls in our party is vegetarian,  so we decided to check out this place with great reviews. 

There were four of us who came to eat, my boyfriend and I, brother's girlfriend and my uncle's girlfriend. I thought the food was wonderful, although I don't have anything to compare it to, as it was my first vegetarian/vegan meal. But what left a bad taste in my mouth was our server, honestly if we had a better server this place would have received a 5 star from me and I felt bad for leaving a 2 star because the food was so good, that I made it a 3 instead.

My brother's gf got the hottie chick burger with fries and violettes purple powder drink, she was super excited for her meal.

My uncle's gf got the make your own breakfast platter I believe, and asked our server if they had waffles and she said no.
Moving along...

I ordered the sausage patty melt for breakfast and my BF was torn between two different entrees, but what made the ultimate decision was the fact that our server told him the Red Rock Nachos came with ""chilli"" which was what he was looking for.

As we waited for our food,  I was looking over the menu still to see what we were going to bring back to the hotel for my uncle and brother. 
As I was reading more of the menu I saw that they indeed had waffles and pointed it out to the girls and we just all agreed maybe it just doesn't come as an option for the make your own, so maybe that's why our server said no.
I was looking around the place to check out the decor, when I over heard a conversation between our waitress and another employee. "" hey what kind of milk did they want for the violette?"" ""Uhhh, soy."" That's when I turned to my brother's gf, asking her if our server ever asked for her choice of milk.  She said ""no, why, I totally forgot to tell her."" That's when I told her well she just made the decision of soy for you. When our server came back she asked her what type of milk was in her smoothie before she drank it and I kid you not our server responded with "" umm what kind of milk did you want?"" Uhh wtf.. who responds that way?! What if there was a nut allergy and she chose almond for her?! Why not just come back to the table and simply ask?

Our food came out, everything looked delicious, of course we took pictures. Lol

Our server came back to check on us and one of the girls said, "" can I please get some ketchup?"" "" it's already on your plate!"" We all looked at her plate and saw no magical ketchup appear. ""Umm I didn't get one"" ""okay, let me get it"".. uhh attitude much.. 

I then look  over to grab some of my BFs nachos and I see him picking at his nachos and flipping chips over, he was looking for said chilli... there was none.

We ate all of our food, we loved it!  We needed our server again so we could order to go orders, but she was preoccupied flirting with the gentleman to our left. Bending over the table with her butt out and her chest in his general visual vicinity, guess it was her mating call.
Finally, she comes over, totally different demeanor than what the gentleman received, darn. My brothers gf asks for a repeat of her order and our server replies with ""you want another one?!"" With complete attitude.

Needless to say, our server needs a attitude check, some training, and some professionalism, or just get rid of her.",eIKl35Uku1NzsaAS-hSg2Q,0,0,3,vCxmu8b1iVPC4h9vR_nSdQ

3617012,2015-08-30,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I wanted to write an update:

First off, I'm very glad that the owner reads the reviews and that she took the time to respond to my mine. I've been back dozens of times since as I love the food. I do have a few more observations to share. 

Customer service does not seem to improve. I notice new employees every time I come so I assume that the turn over is pretty high. Most of the girls are not knowledgable and move Very slowly.

I was in with a girlfriend of mine a few weeks ago and we couldn't even get utensils even after the food dropped. No one paid attention to us. After I got up and asked for some I got a weird vibe about it. No ones comes by later to check on tables, at least this is what my perception was. 

Last week I was dining at the bar and a woman came, new to the place, and asked for a to go menu. The girls handed her a business card. I would at least attempt to say something like ""we are paper free here, please visit us online to see a full menu"". The lady then took a dine-in menu and perused through. Finally, she hails one of the serves and said that she is ready to order. The two girls either didn't hear or they ignored her. She was becoming antsy and it was obvious she needed assistance. A server walked by her to look after guests who came in after her and she had to stop the girl in her path and explain she was asking for help, with a bit of frustration. The server's answer was ""oh... Okay."" No apology or enthusiasm. Yikes. 

On to me:  Last week I had stopped in three times. Once to pick up a 16oz drink-- I was given the smallest container I've ever seen. I am pretty certain that was not 16 oz. it looked more like 8oz. Starbucks grande cup is 16oz and what I got was half of that. I think the very Least a server should know are the serving sizes so that customers are not wasting their money. The Castaway smoothie was delicious though. Really awesome stuff. I did a small spoon of peanut butter instead of almond and it was excellent. 

Second time that week I had a dinner special, I think. It was the Hippy Chick burger and it came with warm seasoned kale and a side of potato mash with gravy. This was absolutely incredible. My burger lacked mayo but I added some ketchup to it and it was great. I ate it with a side of cole slaw, which was also amazing but very Extra creamy. It was swimming in liquidy mayo. It was delicious but too creamy for me. I then ate the kale and mash together. I have to say this was probably the best potato mash I've ever had (other than the ""real"" stuff I make with butter and half&half). The kale was amazing with it, although a pinch too salty. 

This was literally two meals in one and I was beyond satisfied. 

On my third visit I had the falafel pita with cole slaw and a side of fries. The pita itself was absolutely incredible. I loved the texture. I am not sure if it's gluten free but it certainly was Awesome. Other than this, the dish was very bland. The falafels have an excellent potential but were seriously under seasoned; also there were still half bits of chickpeas in them. I'm not sure if this is done on purpose. The mix could have used a lot more cumin, salt and pepper. They were also very crunchy on the outside but not in a good way. They were tiny bits of something that for me, makes me fear I'll chip a tooth. If a little more TLC was put into the preparation, the falafel would have been amazing. 

The hummus inside my pita was flavorless. Literally, it was just blended chickpeas. There was no salt, no pepper, I could not taste tahini in it nor lemon juice. 
I asked for tahini in my pita and tzatziki on the side. I did not taste any tahini in there. You can't miss it, it's a very earthy distinct taste. I guess they forgot to tell the chef. Also, a stuffed pita without onions is like milk without a cookie. The flavor profile was seriously undermined with that omission. 

I had to put a ton of pepper and a bit of salt to pump flavor into this dish. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice. These three things alone elevated the dish to another level. 

My fabulous fries came out without seasoning. I also had to add salt and pepper to them. The cole slaw was perfect amount of creamy and well, that's about it. No salt, nada. I added lemon to it to which helped immediately. 

I feel the chef who worked that day absolutely despises seasoning because everything was so bland and flavorless. 

I have to say that a $10 dish, where a customer gets 3 falafels and a bland experience, is overpriced. Across the way, Sababa's makes a Killer falafel sandwich with the Works for like $8. 

Side note: I sat at the bar for an hour and half looking at a dirty table to my left. It was cleaned up right before I left. There were other tables that weren't bussed but this one was a mess for quite a long time. 

I'll keep coming here because I love the food. I know that in this business we all strive to improve and be better & training our staff to be more observant and in charge is key.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,3,2,4,6O_u81fumGklEWCrkPuqrg

So, they just sat for a while then they would get up and go to the register and grab a menu. We ordered at the register and paid and tipped in advance because I missed the sign coming in from the bright sunlight adjustment in my eyes. We sat ourselves and waited a while - I had to go ask for my drinks and then received them then had to get up and ask for straws. It just seems like people are left in a state of confusion because of that 1 waitress. She gives silent treatment until they look upset. Then asks if they are ready to order.  I feel bad for the owners because of her. The young lady with the glasses was so sweet and attentive to the customers.

I hope the owners are reading these reviews because I see that a lot of people mention the terrible service & I agree. My fianc√© is showing an interest in plant based food and I was excited to bring him here, but after we left he said he's never supporting this restaurant again. We were basically the only table in the restaurant because one other table was already paying and getting ready to leave, and the third table was the managers (or owners, not sure) having what looked like a meeting. We waited 12 minutes for the server to greet us. Mind you, he only came over because I flagged him down, and his greeting was a confused and awkward ""do you have a question about the menu?"" He was the only server so there's no way he thought someone else would greet us. Very strange. My fianc√© got the California Dreamin' burger and after having tried the gardein patty and the beast burger a few days prior, he was highly underwhelmed with this lackluster burger patty. We both liked the chili and my biscuits & gravy were pretty tasty, and that is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. When it was time to pay, we had to ask the hostess for our check & a to-go box because again, our server was nowhere to be found. 

Las Vegas has way too many fantastic restaurant options with amazing service to have to settle for this. Please get your act together with the service, Violette's. My fianc√© was excited to try a vegan place and this was a horrible first impression. We will not be back, and we could have been loyal customers. As a vegan restaurant, you have to try twice as hard to excel because skeptical omnivores walk into your business everyday, and service this bad will surely overshadow the rest of the experience and turn them away.",ecc8giAKqxyy72M-IwI82w,2,0,2,qyT5wXdwX-AShPAbCe0KwA

3865522,2015-03-26,5,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I am SO GLAD my boyfriend and I chose to go here. I'm still smiling because of how great everything was! This is my new favorite vegan place in Las Vegas and I feel like this place sets the bar for other vegan restaurants in the future.

When we first walked in, there were a few other people there and a sign to seat yourself. We walked over to a table close to the bookshelf and immediately went over to it. I saw all sorts of vegan books and cookbooks and some coloring books so I grabbed the Care Bear coloring book and a handful of crayons out of the bucket they had. My boyfriend grabbed the Uno game (which still looked brand new, yay!).

We forgot to grab menus at the front so our server brought them over and we started looking. She brought water over to us within a minute or two of sitting down. 

We had no idea what to get because we hadn't looked over the menu before but I had seen pictures on the yelp page. They were out of a couple of things so I asked our server about it. How hard it is to get everything organic and not trying to buy too much so that it spoils. Totally makes sense to me and I'd rather go to a place that serves quality ingredients instead of somewhere that might be using old, rotten produce! 

So we ended up ordering the nachos and Mac n cheese as kind of an appetizer.... Wrong!! Wrong move! We should have known better! The pictures of the nachos didn't really do them justice... at all. They are stacked at least 6 inches high and are enough for two people to share for dinner! I didn't want to take them home (you know how nachos get after being in the fridge for a day) so I tried to eat as many as possible, as did my boyfriend. I loved the vegan cheese sauce and there was so much guac (my favorite) we couldn't stop eating because they were so addicting! The Mac n cheese didn't help at all, with how thick and rich it was. Heavenly but so filling!

Usually I say ""No Ragrets"" but there were... There were.

One of the other employees checked on us when we were almost done with the nachos and asked if they could get us anything else and we just laughed and said we were waiting on our sandwiches. The look we got was hilarious!! It was like, ""no way are you going to each eat a sandwich after all of that food"". I doubt many people do order anything else after those nachos!! xD

Right after we said we were waiting on our sandwiches, we heard the bell 'ding' to let her know they were ready. She grabs them and comes out saying "" I hope your guys are hungry"". Lol no.. Not even a tiny bit.

But we both stuffed as much in as we could because it's not every day you find amazing vegan food at such a great cost. Really! Everything was SO affordable and it made me so happy!! We still each had half of a sandwich left and our sides so we got some to-go containers and shoved it all in there the best we could.

The nachos held up alright when I ate the remainder that night and the sandwiches are in the fridge, ready to be devoured. I would definitely recommend the Backyard BBQ sandwich! It was on point. The club wasn't my favorite because I didn't much care for the herb tofu but it was still scrumptious. 

I can't wait to come back and try the eggplant parm. This place is great! The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the prices were what I dream of, and I loved the atmosphere. I wish I wasn't a broke btch so I could come here every week.

Total, for our nachos, Mac n cheese, two sandwiches with sides, and giant slice of cake, it came to $38. Two appetizers, two main courses, and desert for less than $50? With enough leftovers to take home and do it all again? HECK YEAH! I love you guys!

4026815,2016-03-18,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I've been to Violette's Vegan 5 times now since they opened, once for a sit down dinner and 4 times for lunch to go (more than a fair chance). My last visit was yesterday, 3/17/16 for lunch. I won't be back again unless changes are made. This is why:

The first time I visited I got the Violette's Club. I was floored by how good it was. And so filling! It comes with a choice of potato salad, fries, and black bean salad. I've tried all three of these sides by now and all are delicious. Though I loved it, I cringed at the price. A $14 sandwich (pre tax) for lunch isn't justifiable anywhere. So I told myself I could only have this as a treat once in a while. Additionally, I made the mistake of ordering at the restaurant instead of calling in ahead of time. I had no idea it would take that long.. I'm talking like a 30 minute wait for a sandwich.

The second time I visited was for dinner with my best friend Dana. Now we are both healthy eaters and former long-term vegetarians. We started with the Red Rock Nachos. These were yummy like I had read in other reviews. Me and Dana agreed they tasted like the real thing.  But the Brunsons Choice, apparently back by popular demand, was just not good at all. Dana said they tasted whatever, like every meatless wing she's had but I disagree. I did not like the texture or taste- it was gross. This is coming from someone who has had countless meat substitutions in her lifetime. For our entree, we split the samurai burger which I don't think is on the menu anymore? I don't know why because this was enjoyable and the portion was large. We thought the meal was overall good. While the service was friendly, it was SUPER slow. Other diners were frustrated as well. After this experience and the previous one, I thought they must be understaffed in the kitchen. Other people on Yelp were also complaining about the wait times. At this point I was wondering why Violette's Vegan doesn't respond to their customers' concerns and hire more people?

The third time I visited was again for lunch as I was craving the delicious Violette's Club. I was smarter this time and ordered 40 minutes ahead of time. By the time I showed up... you will not believe it... but my order STILL wasn't ready! I waited an additional 10 minutes before I was given my food. Yes, this is accurate; I would never want to provide misinformation that could be detrimental to a local business. So I noted the time I ordered, and despite being told it would be ready in 15 minutes, it was not ready until 50 minutes later. Now this is my ONE hour lunch break. Thank goodness I left late, already knowing they are super slow. Additionally, the sandwich was not how I remembered it. The bread was soggy and it tasted bland. Really confusing because it was so perfect the first time I had it. The potato salad was just as good as the first time though. After this visit I vowed NEVER again!

And then I got a gift card two months ago. It was only for $10 so I still ended up paying the additional $5 for the Violette's Club which once again came soggy and bland. The fries were yummy though and surprisingly, it was ready 30 min after I ordered it.

So yesterday I decided to give them ONE more try since I was in the area for lunch. I thought I'd change it up and order the Rockin' Raw wrap. It was okay but it needed more pesto for flavor and for $13, it did not leave me satisfied. I had to eat a granola bar after. The positive is that I ordered by phone at 12:20p and by the time I got there at 12:45p, it was waiting for me. Maybe they're quicker now because they have lost so many customers that they're no longer busy.

I keep on giving this place chances because I want to see vegetarian and vegan places succeed. Listen to your customers' concerns, we want to eat here and give you our business. The lack of consistency and the overpriced lunch will keep me away.",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,14,0,2,kTrTjfhSDQaeQqvcdojgKw

The patty was pretty mushy and tasteless. The entire burger actually lacked any flavor, which was odd considering it had all those ingredients on it. It didn't taste bad and the presentation was nice, it just didn't have flavor. The fries were ok. Not my favorite though. Now this meal cost $14 which I find to be outrageous. I would come back and possibly try other items on the menu because there is still potential there and they have a decent sized menu. I recommend veggie way if you want a good tasting vegan burger.

I just recently transitioned to veganism and I saw the amazing reviews on yelp. We saw that you all were only 2 miles away. My mind was BLOWN when I had my first bite of my Hippie Chick burger! The Red Rockin' Chili was to die for. It was so great we came back again, and again! Each time the food got better. My love and I & our little daughter really enjoyed it. I am so glad we found this place because we will definitely be back. 

Aside from the food, the waitresses were one of a kind. They played with my daughter and were so talkative and friendly.

Options, options, options! This is one thing that this place certainly has. I spent way more time that I should have contemplating which items I wanted to try the most. There were several tie breakers, but my husband and I decided to try The Philly, California Dreamin Bacon Cheeseburger, chilly cheese fries, Mac n cheese, Violette's Purple Power Smoothie, Tropical Sunrise smoothie, and maple iced coffee. We just endured 5 brutal days in Vegas and our bodies needed to recharge! This burger was just the right consistancy and was just the right texture. The toppings made it even more delicious. I've had some pretty amazing vegan burgers, but this one blew the rest out of the water. The philly tasted just like I remember Philly cheesesteak sandwiches but BETTER! How could anyone turn down marinated grilled seitan, peppers and onions, smothered with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. (ALL VEGAN, OF COURSE!) YUMM! 

The space has a very cozy yet open concept. There are crystals, cool art, and other unique decor hanging/sitting around. I noticed that our table had a charging port so that you could get some work done while enjoying some bomb food. They even have couches and a bar like area.

Their menu, unlike a lot of vegan places, offers a wide array of protein types: from juice and smoothies, tempeh and tofu, to sprouts and grains. There are healthy options and less healthy (but still healthy) comfort food options. 

We came here on a Tuesday night and were pleasantly surprised to learn there would be free entertainment in the form of a lovely singer who serenaded us through dinner.

The service here was spectacular. In the course of our dinner we were probably checked on 6 or 7 times, and the waitstaff was friendly, but not in that overly peppy way where you just want to yell ""Down, Fido!"" They were friendly in that ""Namaste"" way. 

The food was incredible. You can really tell that every dish was made with the utmost care. The plates do take a long time to come out, but we did order a lot of tempeh, so I appreciate it was cooked perfectly, which is very hard to pull off. 

We ordered:

- Cauliflower appetizer
- Brunson's choice (buffalo tempeh sticks)
- Buffalo tempeh sandwhich

Everything was delicious and soooo flavorful. It will make any carnivore do a double take. 

My ONLY and only complaints:

Some of the plates were very very small. The cauliflower was literally a couple large florets that you could eat in two bites. Some forewarning about the plate size would be nice. 

We ordered the baguette as the bread choice for the tempeh sandwich. It was over toasted, which made it difficult to eat because the bread was so dry and crunchy to the point where it hurt your mouth. I would suggest to the staff to either lightly toast this, or do not toast it all all. It did such a disservice to the lovely tempeh.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,3,2,4,BRpGBC1hho7nsZQHG04BHg

Son wasn't too excited as he doesn't always love to eat vegan but he really enjoyed his ""chicken nuggets"" and fries as well as my daughter. 

Service wAs good. And the restaurant itself resonates with me on like a level 10000000000000x from the decor, energy, books to read and family things to do  already know it's an absolute fav. 

I'm only giving 4 stars now bc it was moderately busy and possibly just understaffed for the evening so:

The wait was a little long, however food still came out prettty good.

I was a little bummed they didn't have a gluten free pita option for my falafel pita and I would have liked it wth WAAAAAY More greens/veggies. 

We also ordered:

A strawberry, chocolate and vanilla shake that took over an hour

The waitress warned us a little after we placed order that there were a lot of drink orders so it would be a bit so I appreciated the heads up- didnt expect it too take so long but I saw that they took it off the bill so I appreciated that

They all had very different consistentencies and came out 15-20 mins apart but then again, free so can't complain lol

There was only one waitress serving all tables and she kept a good attitude and has a chill energy so I didn't mind too much 

I really enjoyed the restaurant reading the menu and books/playing games with my kids etc while we waited

I will absolutely be back and next time I'm sure everything will go perfect including all the food

4530503,2015-08-19,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I have eaten here so many times before. I'm a local vegan in the entertainment industry here in Vegas and I have tried EVERY vegan restaurant in town. Some of my fav places are located in china town and at the lakes but Violettes  menu is full of  comfort food selections. I was super excited when this place opened. I have eaten there over a dozen times and unfortunately have ran into issues with their service and getting orders right. 

I've ordered out a few times, one time I ordered  my fav, the red rock nachos. Not a difficult dish to make (if you're into vegan cooking) and you would think that common sense would be to put that type of cheese on the side to avoid the wet soggy nacho chips I was sent home with. I also had order a chocolate milkshake  when she brought it to me it was purely chocolate milk... The waitress explanation to this was, 'well the ice cream melts quickly so our shakes tend to be more vegan milk-like. I've worked in the  restaurant  industry for many years and was appalled by this answer.... She could have just figured it out and fixed it....  

I sent my good friend from LA whose a well known actress and public vegan advocate to Violettes. She stopped in and ate breakfast. The breakfast menu is delish and is well thought out when it comes to flavor and portions/price. I recommended pancakes and the sunrise breakfast of course, which has seemed to be a bit on the dry side lately and extra oily veggies but this can be over looked when you're looking for a hearty breakfast fix. They  forgot half her side order of pancakes and when she asked for a refill of coffee TWICE they never brought it... She's an easy going vegan foodie and her dis appointment in my recommendation was embarrassing yet I should have know better from my personal past experiences. 

My most recent experience was so overwhelming. My guy friend had ordered 2 orders of chocolate chip walnut pancakes for us (which was an up charge for the chips they said) we also ordered their sunrise breakfast for that hearty fulfillment. The sunrise breakfast had amazing potatoes, the tofu scramble was dry and unflavored once again and the veggies we soggy.  But worst off they forgot the chocolate chips in our pancakes (second time this has happened). I never call to complain especially because I've been giving them the benefit of the doubt of being new. Well they are now no longer new and I decided to let them know what my experiences have been. I called to give them a heads up in hopes it would help them improve their customer service and they apologized and they took down our names and even offered  a comped meal for our next visit.One week later I called back and they had no recollection or name written down. I knew I was speaking to the manager because I've seen her in there several times and she said there was nothing she could do. I said I've spoken to you about these issues before and dont you have the power to make this right?! She said that she couldn't give a comped meal over the $2 chocolate  chip mishap.... I reminded her that that's not the point and declined entertaining the idea of receiving anything from them. I told her after 8 months of continually trying their restaurant out that I no longer will be a costumer of theirs.... 

I'll take my vegan waffles with fantastic customer service and people who care from Tiabi Waffle House and send  my hippie LA coworkers/friends to Go Raw Cafe down the street where I've been going for several years now and never ONE issue!!! Not to mention the owner is a doll and extremely accommodating. Sorry for the rant yelp friends, again not usually my style of reviewing but I'm tired of feeling taken advantage of by Vegan Violettes and their owner.",CAqi2BJndI4CMK9lk6uE-w,11,0,1,cuH9nAKqSeS2FOgHCDQ_0A

We did order fresh juices and that took a while to get.  There was one girl working the front taking orders, running the register, serving all the tables and making the drinks which explained why our food was coming out before we got our drinks even though we orders the drinks long before the food.

All the food we ordered was amazing.  We had a curry bowl, the club, and two appetizers which were all fantastic.  We ended up taking food home and it was just as good the next day.

Other then the slow service in getting things going everything was great and this is a place we would go to again and recommend.  I know other reviews dos not have as great an experience but I say give them a little time and try them again.  A place that is Vegan with all the selections they have is hard to find in this town.

When I came in it was seat yourself. I sat at the juice bar and then waited... No one gave me a menu or helped me for several minutes. Finally the guy behind the bar asked if he could help me. I requested a menu. He gave me a glass of water with no ice or straw. The water tasted good, but it was strange how he served it.

I ordered a Nature Girl salad and the zucchini sticks. 

The zucchini sticks were the high point. The breading is very crispy and tasted good. The sauce wasn't as salty as I like, but I probably eat too much salt. I would def recommend this dish. Yum

The salad was another story. Everything tasted good and fresh...just incredibly bland. The tofu was good. The dressing was served on the side and it was very thick. It had the consistency of cream cheese. It also wasn't the right choice for this salad. The salad was really bland and would be 100% better with a zesty vinaigrette.    

After I ate I had to request my check. Sat for several minutes with my napkin on my plate and still no one brought my check.

I've had the pancakes, good day burrito, texas hold em, and the country classic. They were all delish! My kiddo likes the mac and cheese and the lentil soup as well as the mashed potatoes and gravy. Hubby likes the Philly.

The servers are very nice but sometimes they are forgetful or just inexperienced. Be sure to order your child's food first so it comes out first. It happened to us once and other parents say the same thing - sometimes they bring out the adults' food and make the kids wait, which is a huge no-no in food service. But all the servers are really nice and they seem to like kids. There's also a few kids toys and things to do on the community bookshelf in the corner.

They deliver too. I can't review that aspect because I live outside the delivery boundaries but that's kind of cool that they deliver.

On thing - I feel like if they're going to be open for breakfast on weekdays then they should open at 6 or 7am for people who work. Instead, they open at 9. It's just kind of weird. I would expect a place like that to open at 10 or 11 on weekdays and then offer a Sunday brunch. But what they do is they serve breakfast from 9-11:30 and then lunch at 11-5pm (and then dinner). It's just odd to me. If you go out with a group at 10 or 11am you might want to do brunch, not just breakfast. And if you roll in at 12pm you might still want some breakfast foods. I just think brunch makes a lot more sense, but whatever, that's not a deal-breaker.

I recently started this whole plant-based thing (like...2 months or so ago) and was STOKED to try Violette's. I'm a total foodie in general, so I figured this place would have awesome vegetable dishes and a few ""alternative versions"" of classics like burgers and such.  

What. A. Disappointment.

It was like the vegan version of mediocre diner food. SO much of what's on the menu is fried food. Like, I'm eating plants to be healthier, why would you make all that healthy food unhealthy by deep-frying it?  

We ordered one of the burgers, the faux chicken wings/fingers, the eggplant parm, and the nachos between 3 of us and shared it all.  As a nacho lover, I was severely disappointed. Not just the vegan cheese (which wasn't that bad), but the chips, the toppings, nothing had flavor. And come on people - it's NACHOS, can we get a little heat??

The burger had great reviews and I was so excited about it, but we couldn't eat it between 3 of us (and I love veggie burgers). Overall, the food lacked flavor and spices. Everything was bland (again, much like a mediocre diner). I feel like they really had an opportunity to kick things up with flavor and just decided not to.  The eggplant parm could have used garlic, onion, anything!  Honestly - the best thing I ate was the steamed broccoli.

I wish I could say I'll be back, but alas, I'm back on the hunt for a vegan place with will impress even the meat-eaters in my life.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,8,3,2,zKlKNPaHBiIh0xryVtql9Q

But the wait for your meal and inconsistent service will really test your patience. So  tonight was my third attempt. I was greeted promptly and my order was taken several minutes after. Which I was so pleased with! The time before I waited almost 20 minutes. I ordered a gluten free quesadilla which took a little under 40 minutes. I wouldn't order it again. Just typing this out is making me nauseous. I'm sure with the normal flour tortilla, it's probably fantastic!  The girl told me after 20 minutes of waiting that they make the tortilla from scratch and it would take longer. Which, believe me, I know gluten free is tricky. But it tasted like an undercooked, soggy pancake. After finishing my meal (which I am currently paying the price for) it took about another 20 minutes to get the tab. At this point, it's just me, a guy who had been sitting for 15 minutes with no order placed (and the same desperate look on his face that I had on mine) and a delivery guy. Despite my negative review, I know a lot of people enjoy this place. Don't let this stop you from trying, just make sure you aren't in a rush.

After hiking the Grand and Zion Canyon, we decided to stay in Vegas on the way home for one night.  My friends and I opted for something light and i'm a huge fan of Vegan cuisine.  It's light, flavorful, and I feel like a million bucks after. 

We started off with the Nachos. Ah these were ok, but, sadly, were the highlight of the whole experience. They needed more things to make it moist, not enough guac/ It was a dry nacho.  Looking at other pictures, I noticed they used a nacho sauce and salsa.  Now, compare others with the one I got. Mine is just sad. I feel ripped off. 

Next, we had the mac and cheese. We had to send it back because they gave us the end of their mac and cheese. You know the part where you bake a large pan and then ends get really hard and dry. Yup, that part was served to us and it was not good.  I actually like this part when it comes to lasagna, but not mac and cheese. We actually asked the server to exchange it because there is no way i'm paying for it. She was kind and replaced the order.  But again, flavor was lacking and it was still dry. 

I was beginning to feel uncomfortable eating the food. Like as if it I was forced to eat this. The pad thai came out, and it resembled nothing like pad thai. There was no peanut flavor whatsoever. Actually, all we tasted was lemon. We had one bite each and called it quits.  

We opted out of dessert bc why? Paid our check and left. If you're ever in San Diego, you have to try Native Foods. Large portions, priced well, excellent service, and food is AMAZING!",QzJlPNswAoYk-bJVXYa-Hg,8,3,1,qov7qesRtJA-NIUx_b0sHw

The food is creative, fresh, 100% vegan, and so delicious! (My mouth is actually watering just thinking about it.) We go a little overboard when we come here, but I regret nothing.

You can't go wrong with anything on their breakfast menu. I always go for the build-your-own option so I can have a little of everything.

- Red Rockin' Chili Cheeze Fries
(I have never had ""real"" chili, but my boyfriend thinks this vegan chili is BETTER than real chili. It is amazing.)

- Shinto Steak Sandwich / Potato Salad
(Tempeh marinated in teriyaki sauce, with miso mayo, greens, avocado, and bean sprouts on ciabatta. Unbelievable. The textures are so satisfying and I've never tasted a more flavorful sandwich in my life.)

What I liked immediately was that there was plenty of tables and you can seat yourself, so you find what you like.  The decor and style of the place is very well done.  Almost transport you away from the beige-ness of Las Vegas and into a very urban and hip environment.  This makes the experience so much better.

The service - Very nice pleasant and informative.

The food - 

a.  The French toast - Wow, fluffy and densely moist?  How can it be that it has almost a moist cake like filling but it is fluffy at the same time.  Tasty with butter and syrup.  I am not sure of the calorie content of this, but man, i enjoyed this!

b.  The Rise and Shine - Now this is the first time I have had tofu scrambled with veggies and it was amazing!  I really enjoyed it and the flavor and the consistency was very good.  It came with sausage and home potatoes and I added tempeh bacon.  I am not a huge tempeh fan and wanted to try this.

c.  Organic Coffee that is local and also served with almond  milk.  Nice.

The sassy wings took some time to prepare which the cashier kept going to the back to check on them and giving me voluntary updates.

I couldn't wait until I got home so I opened them up in the car and omg....!!!! Friggin Delicious the BBQ flavor was amazing and totally not what expected. I highly recommend it if your in the neighborhood and looking for a great wing alternative.

First dish: rise and shine platter...tofu scramble, potatoes, collared greens, breakfast sausage, and toast.  It was awesome.  The tofu scramble is on the spicy side, but it have it good flavor.  I loved the potatoes..It think it was just baked.  Even the toast seemed fancy and tasted good, lol.  Ooh, and I loved loved loved the breakfast sausage.

Second dish:  sunrise platter: BLT made with tempeh bacon, collard greens, and  potatoes.  This was my favorite!!!!-the BLT tasted so much like the real deal. Usually I'm not into fake meats, cuz it's always a hit or miss with me, but this bacon was da bomb!!

Third dish: multi grain waffles with mixed fruit: this was awesome.  It had coconut whipped cream, nom nom nom!! It made the waffles just amazing!! It was a perfect combination with the mixed fruit.  

I already tried the smoothies and I love it too. I usually add the plant based protein for $1.25.  All the flavors are good, but my favorite is violetta's purple smoothie.

I'm really glad this place exists. It has a huge menu that's 100% vegan, and it includes things I miss like pancakes and quesadillas. The decor and restaurant environment is wonderful. Very new, clean, and colorful. 

However, the service is super slow! Relatively simple dishes take at least 30 minutes on average. 

Do not get the Samurai Burger. It is absolutely disgusting. It legitimately tastes like snails. I rarely leave food over, and my friend is a huge eater, but we couldn't choke it down even between the two of us. In all seriousness, I could not describe it in any way other than Bitter Essence of Snail. It should be called the Snail Burger. By far the worst burger I've ever had in my life. I felt nauseous for hours afterwards. 

The last time I visited, I was so excited to get vegan pancakes. SO EXCITED. But taking that first bite of that corn cake was one of the saddest moments ever. They gave me sad, gluten-free pancakes. I looked over at the other table as they enjoyed their normal, delicious-looking pancakes and stared down at the sad, yellow, grainy excuse for pancakes on my plate. (Definitely never ordered gluten-free, ew). I hope this is not a common mishap, because I'm just not the type to complain or send food back.

The staff is always really friendly. They make great recommendations. The first time I got the bacon cheeseburger. I asked for no thousand Island sauce and it came with it anyways but it still tasted delicious so I wasn't too mad. The second time I got the temp a steak sandwich, which was so delicious but a little bit oily. Overall I would get either one again, but I would prefer to try all the items on the menu. Their fries are really good too. They are pretty soft which is what I prefer instead of crispy fries.

5090435,2015-12-02,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"So, Violette's has stepped up their game.  I tried it out a few times within the first few months they were open, then again about 3 months ago, and was disappointed w/ the service and w/ inconsistent food quality.  I'm a member of a local vegan facebook group where a couple of months ago, there was a very long thread of many of us disappointed and wishing it was better.  I neglected to write a bad review at first because they were new, and because we do need more vegan options in the city - but at the same time we also shouldn't be sacrificing quality.

Well - I can't say anything for the service, because I haven't dined again, but in the past week I ordered delivery and take out and thoroughly enjoyed both.

Delivery Order - Philly Cheesteak w/ side of Chilly Cheese Fries.  This was really good.  I believe they use Seitan as the steak which was season nicely w/ the cheeze sauce, onions, & peppers on a fresh whole wheat roll.  The chilly cheese fries were also delicious, and the fries stood up to the cheese and chilly even with being in the car for a bit and in an enclosed container.

Take Out Order - Backyard BBQ, Chilly Cheese Fries (again), and a slice of chocolate cake (how could I resist?!  It was RIGHT there!)  I must have read the menu wrong, because I though the Backyard BBQ was BBQ Seitan w/ carmelized onions on a bed of greens (i.e. Salad) but it was actually a sandwich (with the same whole wheat roll from the philly), I believe it also had vegenaise on it.  It was quite tasty!  The fries again did not disappoint and neither did the cake.

I know some have complained about the slight price increase, but the food really is still quite reasonable and if the rising prices are accompanied by tastier and better quality food, I'm all for it.

Violette's - thanks for listening and upping your game.  I look forward to future visits.",rg9BnWtWbEusg8GBnS8JsQ,1,2,4,1Xbwp6T87EkxIVmTttgLlQ

I started with an appetizer of Bronson sticks, I believe it was baked Tempeh (similar to tofu, but harder in texture) with a special buffalo sauce- friggin delicious. Next I had a Natures Girl salad, be careful there is enough for two! I can't begin to tell you how satisfying this meal was, for me, it was the tamari roasted almonds and herb tofu that did it. You've probably read enough reviews to know you have to try a slice of chocolate fudge cake, yeah, I had it, but my fat butt also had to try the coconut-lemon cake. I regret getting two slices because holy-MOLY they don't just give you a ""slice"" it's more like 1/3 of the cake type of slice lol. Hands down, the chocolate cake was amazing- and I DONT EVEN LIKE CHOCOLATE (that much anyway).. I would have preferred the lemon cake to have a more robust lemon flavor but unfortunately the coconut stole the show.

5322408,2015-08-06,8,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"I've been to Violette's Vegan a few times and it's alright. Do I crave it? No. Is the food memorable? Nah. Is it on par with the amazing Vegan restaurants in LA or NYC or MIA? Heck to the no. Is there quality in the food? Yes!

Here's why I cut Violette's Vegan some slack. They're serving up ethically sourced, non-GMO, earth friendly food. Food that's semi-good for you (depending on what you order). 

The menu consists mostly of soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, quesadillas, and burgers. Plus a slew of overpriced juices/juice blends. I hate to say it, but Violette's Vegan is basically a conscious Applebee's, but with the exception that everything is made in house, non-GMO, and ethically sound. Why is there SO much bread at these vegan joints? I really hope the menu expands because what this place does/ what it's trying to accomplish (in my perspective) misses the mark. I hope the menu gets more creative, which is the energy that fills this space, rather than a humdrum of sticking to the boring vegan status quo. When I eat out, I don't want to feel like I could duplicate the same simplicity in my own kitchen. Where Violette's truly shines is in the soup department. Every single soup I've had here has been delicious (and yes, I order soup when it's 106 degrees out). Service is friendly, warm, and casual.

The space is bright and is a total hippie haven (not hipster, straight hippie). Although Violette's isn't my go-to, it's a great plan B because I know I can find quality, healthy options. There's a giant juice bar and book shelf which guests are invited to read while dining in house. They also have movie, guest speakers and featured menu nights.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,14,10,3,VWtstj-uw92zlAvg1p1Hbw

My quinoa salad was pretty good too, it had lots of fresh veggies and was big enough that I took at least half of it home to eat later.

The comfort food aspect shines and really sets it apart from others.  Herbivores or anyone like me that occasionally swings that way should add Violette's Vegan to what has grown into a decent rotation of meatless meals around town.  I didn't have an great dinner, but I think that's on me and my poor decisions.    

 ""Red Rock Nachos"":  Waitress recommended.  While plentiful and filling, the vegan cheese sauce was the biggest difference between this version and a typical plate at a video poker bar and it was just OK.  Perhaps melted shredded vegan cheese would have been a superior alternative.  

""Mama Mia"": The eggplant parmesan was better than I thought it would be.  The breading was delicious with the plant based mozzarella substitute being surprisingly good.  The only minus was the flimsy, overdone pasta.  I have NO clue what came over me in ordering this entr√©e. I could've had this at any great Italian eatery!!!  Did I check my brain at the door??  Total choke job by me.  Rarely happens.  Figures I do it in a vegan joint of all places!!  Ha!  

 ""Shangri La Sunset"":  My wife's choice only because they didn't have the rice bowl she wanted.  Seitan chicken stir-fried with vegetables was a decent, healthy dish, but it just had me longing for another veggie place on Spring Mountain.  I grounded out, she flew out.  

In the end, I misclicked this whole experience and wished to press the reset button.  We plan on getting the Hungry Man, Samurai Burger, Bubba Ke Bubba and falafel next time.  Hoping to go back soon and right my wrongs.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,53,39,3,sq9LC4hkn1-Xt8_G1XIpyw
5544606,2016-06-04,3,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"3 1/2 stars, really. Potato Salad.  Potato Salad. POTATO SALAD! This is my way of expressing just how much I LOVE their potato salad, which made me give them 4 stars instead of 3. Coming from Missouri, which has very ""southern"" roots and ways, I love a creamy, mayo-based potato salad, but had not been able to find a good one since becoming vegan.  The search is over. As I ate my potato salad in my car, I contemplated going back to ask for the rest of their pot, tupperware bowl, etc. I need this in bulk! (They should sell it at Sam's or Costco!) Moving on...

I also got 2 orders of the Sassy Wings, but one order was buffalo sauce only. While the flavor of the sauce was very good, I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of their wings; they were too thick.  I prefer a thinner, less ""faux-meaty"" consistency. They were just ok, to me.  I ordered a side of their Fabulous Fries, which were excellent in flavor/seasoning.  

I also got their Country Classic, which, per the menu, comes with crispy tempeh & tofu cutlets (1 of each), collard greens,mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Sounds like a proper southern meal. However, to my dismay, I ended up with a cauliflower, broccoli, and carrot medley instead of the promised greens. (I had hot sauce in my bag for those greens!) I didn't like the cornbread or the cutlets. I was disappointed, to say the least. The mashed potatoes were good though. 

The carrot cake that I ordered was delicious.  I was supposed to get a free Red Rockin' Chili with my Yelp check-in, and she even marked it as ""Used"" on my app, however, it was MIA from my to-go bag. 

I may not have had the best experience with all of the food I ordered, but I still really like this place. The vibe was mellow, light auras, friendly worker, clean and welcoming environment, and the prices are fair. It's in a strip mall, so there is plenty of parking, and there is signage everywhere... On each corner for each intersecting street and on the front and back of the building, which was extremely helpful for me as I was looking for it.

It's a ""seat yourself"" type of restaurant and our server told us about the breakfast and brunch menu since it was our first time. We each got a free coffee when you purchase an entree (love how they serve fresh ""Desert Wind Coffee Roasters"" & support local business since that's my favorite coffee shop in town!) which comes with almond milk and brown sugar as the sweetener.

As our appetizer, we checked in to get a free Red Rockin Chili - which was great and tasted like regular chili! It comes in a huge bowl which was good enough for us to share. 

For our entrees, we decided to go with the Hippie Chick Burger with a side of French fries and the make your own tofu scramble with tempeh bacon, brown rice, and a side of pancakes. 

OH MAN. The burger was super tasty and probably the best vegan burger I've had so far! I think what really brought out the flavors was the pesto that was in it - so yummy and a serious must try! 5/5 for sure! 

My bf really enjoyed the tofu scramble because the tempeh bacon was DELICIOUS! It was so flavorful and even better than regular bacon. 5/5 as well! 

We were so full but decided to get the vegan donuts to go; they have a little display of their vegan desserts and they all looked delicious! Definitely looking forward to trying those for next time.

Service was prompt and friendly.  I spotted a Ninja behind the bar where a vitamix or Blendtec normally resides.  I'm a blender freak so I didn't try the smoothies after spotting that.

2nd time lunch with my daughter- she loved the games they had to play with .. the Red Rock Nachos were amazing & such a generous portion !! Great deal .. couldn;t finish them & waitress said no one has yet so .. 

Next time we brought re-enforcements !! My wife put us over the top !! We were able to finish but I was disappointed we didn't receive a plaque or get our name on the wall 

We've had & loved the Mac n Cheese & the veg burger + I loved a salad I had with mint but can't remember the name ...

5629676,2015-02-06,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"As a vegetarian, I am used to having maybe one or two (three, TOPS) items to choose from at restaurants. So, going into Violette's Vegan Organic Eatery and Juice Bar was overwhelming in the best of ways. I felt like a kid in a candy store! I've been to Violette's twice, and have had the privilege to mooch off all my dining mates' plates both times. As such, I've sampled quite a bit from their menu. Some things are hits! Others--- eh, not so much. Here are my thoughts:

**STARTERS**
-Wild Buffalo Sticks: Coated in a nice sauce! Reminds me of Frank's RedHot Sauce, my favorite. A must-have.
-Mediterranean Hummus Platter: Fine, but a bit on the thin side. (I like mine thicker.) I expected the pita bread it came with to be warmed up, but alas it was cold. Still worth trying, as it all comes down to personal preference. 
-Grateful Greens Juice: I am not super into juicing, but decided to try this just because! Alas, I can't say I was a fan, but it might be my fault. I was expecting it to be served cold and less thick. Also, the celery was pretty over-powering. Nay.

**ENTREES**
-Violette's Southern Comfort: I wasn't a huge fan of the mac and cheeze. As a vegetarian who still consumes dairy, I find I'm super picky with vegan cheeses. While creamy, the cheeze was rather bland. I loved the crispy tempeh wedges, which reminded me of a vegetarian friendly fried chicken. I added a delicious baked yam to the side to complete my soul food comfort meal, and it was divine. However, I probably wouldn't order this again due to the mac and cheeze being lackluster.
-The Hungry Man: My Dad, who hates everything he ever orders at any restaurant, got this combo of faux meats, gravy, and mashed potatoes and he LOVED it (as did I). It was hearty and flavorful--- the kind of meal you want to order on a cold day. I would order this a million times over.
-El Toro Grande: A friend ordered this and I snuck a bite of the burrito ""butt."" I thought maybe I didn't get to savor in the flavor because I only had tortilla and enchilada sauce, but my friend reported it was bland over all. The menu reports it comes with steamed veggies, but hers did not. (They didn't appear to be in the burrito, nor the side. Not sure what the scoop is with that one.)
-Samurai Burger: My sister got this Asian themed burger. I sampled the patty, which was firm and had a nice texture. Be warned it's served on a pita bread type bun, and somewhat difficult to eat. Definitely use your fork and knife and devour as a tasty open-faced sandwich.
-Mama Mia: Delicious eggplant, pasta, bread, and greens. The serving was ginormous! I was only able to try a few bites of this one, but I would probably order it for myself next time. The marinara sauce was especially delicious.
-Taco Trio Love Bowl: Consisting of three hard-shelled tacos, each one with different fillings, the Taco Trio provided a nice variety! The cheeze on it had a hummus-like consistency that worked great with the meal. It also included rice and a salad. Very good!

**DESSERTS**
-Triple Chocolate Cake: The moistest chocolate cake, ever. Their menu is not lying. Everyone needs to order this cake.
-Totally Rawesome Cheeze Cake: Not too sweet, this grainy dessert was strangely satisfying. It's supposed to come your choice of fruit toppings, but they didn't have fresh fruit when we visited. No bother, it was good as-is!
-Heavenly Chocolate Mousse Pie: Simple mousse pie. Like pudding and crushed graham crackers. It was fine, but I don't know if I'd order it again, because the Triple Chocolate Cake is 579573 x's better.

**SERVICE**
-The service was fine, with all the staff being polite and professional. However, since I visited twice within the first week of so they opened, I could tell they were still trying to get into the swing of things (it took the servers awhile to enter the meals in the computer, long waits between ordering and food arrival, etc.).
-I do have to commend the server I saw the 2nd time I went. I wish I had got her name! In addition to being a vegetarian, my mom is allergic to eggs and nuts. She was particularly worried because some of the cheezes contain cashews, etc. The server took the time to talk to the chefs to make sure the meal was suited for my mom. Great customer service!
-I noticed the owner was present, and even brought out some of our food! I only know she's the owner from the FB page. I thought it was great that she was working alongside her staff. She definitely led by example. Nice work!

**COMMENTS**
One last word to the wise: their Yelp page lists some hours, their Facebook page others. At this point, I'm unsure if they're open for breakfast/lunch, or just dinner at 5:00 pm. They also closed for a random day last week. I recommend calling ahead to ensure they're open before you stop by! My sister went back for a subsequent visit, and was sad to find their doors closed, even though it was during their listed hours of operation. We'll DEFINITELY have to try again another time!",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,8,3,4,LfjYkQzR9wpHddXn-Dc4uw

I also had the Fabulous French Fries and I never had anything cooked in rice bran oil- I wonder if the type of oil used makes them crispy? I tried one of the big noodles in the Violette's Mac N' Cheeze and it was really creamy. I saved the Lemon Scampi for later and had it for dinner; it was still good and very healthy. There's a lot of variety in the menu and that's a good thing I really recommend this restaurant but oh my goodness if you go try the tea.,AuHqjD6H2BbHR5enKSgOtQ,0,0,5,aZwwl1piP6IwwCy9xqCkhQ

I mentioned I wasn't feeling well so the waitress recommended a ""shot"" I could take which consisted of wheat grass, turmeric, apple cider vinegar, and some other stuff I can't remember...it actually made me feel better!

The ambience is nice - pleasant and very colorful. We came for dinner yesterday and ordered Sassy Wings (BBQ seitan)  and the nachos as appetizers. Both were good - especially loved the Sassy Wings!   The Yelp offer provides one free Red Rock chili - meaty with pinto and black beans - also good!  The entree ordered was The Godfather - spaghetti with meatballs served with salad and garlic bread to die for - small sourdough slices that were crusty and flavorful. Two pieces came with the order and my husband ordered four more to go!  My daughter and I ordered sides of Mac & cheese with breadcrumbs, French fries, mashed potatoes with gravy, and Southwestern bean and corn salad with red onion and a lime vinaigrette - tasty. I usually don't like vegan Mac & Cheese - this was good!  I got a few of my daughter's fries, spooned Red Rock Chili on it and ordered a side of their cheeze to recreate the chili cheeze fries on the menu - tasty!

I think Breakfast is only served on the weekend, so we were in luck. We had to come back for more, so made it our Father's Day Brunch location. We hit the jackpot in that they were giving Fathers half off their meal - too good!  Sassy Wings were part of the Brunch menu - yay!  We also got the Yelp offer of Red Rock chili and it was a huge bowl that came with corn bread. There were specific menu items as well as build your own breakfast choosing from 3,4, or 5 categories with accompanying prices. Offerings included Southwestern tofu scramble with black beans, corn, and cilantro, sausage link or patty, biscuit (definitely a homemade type - great!, and the strawberry jam was perfect - not too sweet), organic fruit (sliced strawberries, blueberries, and bananas), and home fried potatoes with onions. My daughter got the sausage muffin with cheeze and tofu - she loved it!  The only addition needed was salt, and it was so nice to see pink Himalayan salt (what I use at home) on the table - perfect!

Our dinner was what we consider normal cost for three. Today with 1/2 off was awesome - all that food for $30 including tax!  I tipped our waitress based on the actual cost of the food.

5936230,2016-10-30,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,First time here. Decoration and service was good. Food is mediocre and kind of pricy for what it is. We believe in healthy vegan foods and they utilize seitan in most of their dishes which gives us only few options to choose from.,9PSFGB7lrClBMnvNt9mT8A,6,4,3,BSYzvh_oZabZ2RXuEsUzFg
5939541,2017-07-17,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Although this place came highly recommended, I can't say the same thing after my experience yesterday. 

Given that it was my first time as a customer, service was a sad affair. The owner/manager must have short staffed the servers because it took 20-30 mins for the server to get our orders written down and taken the kitchen. 

The menu seemed visually enticing but it didn't quite deliver.  Yes, they had pasta with fake meat and pad Thai with fake meat but just because it's vegan doesn't mean quality has to be mediocre.  I feel like they're saying, here's a vegan dish. Take it or leave it. 

I'm giving it 3 stars for the ambiance though. It was so boho chic and reminded me of fond memories of SoCal living.",jUnS8REftaFlO9hPdHS1ug,0,0,3,MD4AcgilsR3Ki5RWZ5GbRg
5941340,2016-12-24,1,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,I ordered The Godfather pasta meal. It wasn't very flavorful. It was crammed into a foil container with my garlic bread inside so when it arrived it was nice and soggy. The salad tasted like dirt as if hadn't been washed. It's overpriced and not good. Maybe their juices and smoothies are better don't know or maybe I should've ordered what was recommended. Needless to say I wasted my money as I couldn't even eat to get full because it was nasty. Won't be eating here again.,BiA8eK9YGGBFnkX6kLPzKg,3,1,1,3mjXXld--JG8QT8qumL6xA
5944547,2016-03-28,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"My husband and I visited this place for the first time. I'm vegan he's not. He got the California Dreamin burger and it was delicious (I wish I got it) I got the El Toro Burrito, which was good but definitely not as flavorful as the burger. We also got a free red rockin chili with out Yelp app and that was awesome. My very picky husband enjoyed everything. Would go again (except it's far from us). Also the sweetened ice teas are not very good. Tasted like crystal light without sugar.",gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,0,0,5,fu5uvYwF95thICBrmdwXRg
5945965,2017-03-12,11,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"Yummy! Personally, I don't like eating meat all the time and I'm sure this place can convince a meat lover to do the same. The food is fresh and has a bountiful menu ranging from small bites to kids meals to desserts. There is something for everyone and the restaurant has a very welcoming feel to it. Not like the in your face vegan, this is the right way to live vibe. 

I had a swizz and mushroom burger and you could swear it was beef. It was cooked perfectly with house made French fries. It's already hard to make vegan food fun and this place nails it. Good job guys.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,30,24,5,DdlbS9BnX7HBkyVnwkUTGQ
5950689,2017-02-25,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,Delicious pad Thai. Having the cauliflower act like chicken or shrimp. Clever. Great peanut sauce. The salad dressing was yummy too.

The food doesn't dissapoint and if we've ever had a problem they've made it right. Our server Chris rocks, (no pun intended) he is always super friendly and has an awesome attitude. Sonia has also served us in the past and she is so amazing and friendly too! Violette's vegan bacon cheeseburger is always on point and the mac n cheeze is one of my favorites. Weekend breakfast and brunch is also recommended. Violette's Vegan comes highly recommended!!!",Uy24AFITDfuRQvwIxqZWnQ,0,0,5,q3LKREDWQ2MFsijsguQJ0g

Anyone considering going vegan or wanting to eat less meat Violette's is a great place to start. My only gripe is they only serve their breakfast menu on the weekends :(,GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,5,3,5,JjF_oS4u4DTNaZ2k0E7dHg
5978704,2017-04-03,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,"The food was super good and the atmosphere was kind, calm, and clean. However, I went with a group of friends (there were 3 of us total). One paid with cash and the other two with card. She took the cash and split the remaining balance between me and the other girl instead of actually splitting the bill and just charging everyone for their meal. On top of that she gave herself a $5 tip; my friend ended up paying $16 + a $5 tip when her meal only cost $10. The food was good but not worth the rip off again.",VoRYTBty1GI2Dw6yOYeTqA,0,0,2,x6NbpUZt8ArsT1fdYp7KIg
5996396,2017-05-05,0,NQXuoB9JTPUItHvouMgWjQ,One of my best friends became a vegan maybe a year or two ago. It's hard to suggest places knowing there's quite a bit of things she cannot have so my other best friend and I decided we'd give a vegan restaurant a try since it's only fair that she's always coming to anywhere and everywhere we suggest. I didn't know what to expect at all but just went with it. We all ordered a coffee and they both chose agave as their sweetener which was sweet enough and made the coffee taste really good. The waitress was very helpful with all the questions we had about how their sausage and bacon were made. I decided to get the rise n shine platter. I didn't know the eggs were made of tofu but they were my favorite and the sausage was made of Tempe which I had never heard of before that day. I personally enjoyed my meal and my friend bought us all the bacon to try since it was also made with something that's not meat but I forget what they had said to us. Anyway we enjoyed it and said next time We would love to try the nachos and maybe a dessert!,P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,y2l2nX4zKeUr_TvP-o9UNg
