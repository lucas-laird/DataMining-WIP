26268,2010-04-21,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"I like Hush Puppy, my husband does not.  The atmosphere here could not be cuter- it looks like a log cabin inside, with lots of different rooms that feature outdoor waterfalls.  Service is friendly and attentive and really could not be better.  Their hush puppies are far from authentic, they almost taste like grits or cornmeal that was fried and shaped into tiny ovals.  They do come with a tasty honey butter and they bring you a hot basket the minute you sit down.  Hush Puppy is packed during the week from 5pm on, so expect a wait (they have a large sitting area in the front).  They are famous for their $25 all-you-can-eat crab legs on Mondays, as well as other all-you-can-eat items like catfish, shrimp, and even ribs (around $12).  Entrees come with a trip to their old fashioned salad bar, which has macaroni, potato, pasta salads and coleslaw as well as tartar, coctail sauce and lemons.  Their fried catfish is decent, not overbreaded or greasy, but tasted a bit swampy for my taste.  Their fried shrimp are heavy and the fried oysters tasted like the ocean. The highlight was their seasoned shrimp skewers with fried green tomatoes and remoulade, which were quite good.  Entrees also come with their green tomato relish, something they sell by the jar at the entrance.  I'd recommend trying this place once for the atmosphere and experience alone, though their food is average and would not stand up anywhere in the south.
It should also be noted that they have a drive through, which features the same menu items at much more reasonable prices.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,0,0,3,a_Q92-n1RMYmUgY6kqc8pA

We decided to go today, and oh my, what a treat it was.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel right at home, even more so when we told them that it was our first visit. Penney answered all of our questions about the menu, and gave brought samples of the catfish (farm raised & fresh water). Penney is the greatest, and we did not wait very long to get our food served.  She checked to see if everything was okay and if we needed anything. We also met John Lopez, an exceptional man, that stopped by to see if we were being taken care of and if the food was okay.  John brought Chan more catfish and showed him how to eat cold slaw and green tomatoes relish (chow-chow) with the fish. Everything was so delicious, the catfish, salad bar, baked potatoes, fries, and the mouth watering hush puppies with the sweet cream butter. We were both too full to try the dessert. but we have already decided that we will be back on Wednesday for more of this delicious food and excellent service.  We are very pleased and recommend this restaurant to everyone that want great service and excellent food.  The prices are very reasonable and we will be back (weekly).

They bring you a nice size basket of hushpuppies, like bringing chips elsewhere, before you order.  We did not ask for them, just brought to us.  At the end of the meal there were a lot left over so we asked if we could get them packed up to go.  We were told no due to them being part of all you can eat. ?? We got them before we ordered any all you can eat dish remind you.  So I made a statement to the waitress to the effect of ""so they just throw all of those away?""  And she replied in an odd manner, ""yeah, they just throw them away"".

Seems odd that a place would throw away a lot of good food they brought to you for free to begin with rather than let you take it.  Doesn't it?  If you do go here, I would recommend skipping the hushpuppies.  Would probably skip anything fried.",ueCkYms5-gsobEPzfh_IwA,1,0,1,eL0O3BAwfcKJJ9ueQvYQtA

354322,2016-06-12,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Maybe the recipe has changed?  Maybe they have a new chef?  Maybe it was just that we both felt embarrassed by the 20 cents owed situation?  I don't know.  

Since they now charge for sauces it would be a nice thing if they could ask the cashiers to simply ask as they are placing the orders, ""Would you like any additional sauces with your order""?  That would give the customer the opportunity to add the cost of the sauces to the original bill and to pay for them with their credit card all at once.  I know, for me that would have completely helped my situation and changed my overall experience.

I'm just sad because this was my special place.  It was THE go to place for a nice family treat.  Mom and I both said we don't want to go back for a long while.  We both kind of lost the taste for fish.  It's a long drive from my house, but I will go back this week to pay the 20 cents that is owed.

The salad bar is extremely limited and the smell of sewage was horrible in the salad bar area.
The service was not very good either. The waitress gave us a menu and right then already asked if we were ready to order. Like they were trying to get us in and out in minutes! During dinner the waitress told the person eating the crab legs that he was doing it wrong and insisted on literally showing him how to eat them!
The french fries were horrendous, obviously having been fried in very old oil, making them greasy and with a nasty taste.

The restaurant is always pretty packed, especially on Mondays when they have the all-you-can-eat crab legs special. They have an all-you-can-eat salad bar, and a great fun menu with things like alligator tail and frog legs. We had to try both of those items and I must say they were actually pretty good. Everything is battered,  fried and super unhealthy, I'm sure, but the catfish is absolutely to die for. They actually have a drive-through order option which is really convenient, but my only complaint is that once I ordered catfish and fries and instead got a catfish sandwich and I was expecting to get some hush puppies on the side (standard on every order) but they were missing from my to-go bag. I would say definitely come here for the food, and expect polite service, and moderate prices, but also expect it to be very loud and crowded inside. This is indeed Las Vegas!

446432,2010-09-28,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"I wanted to love this place.  I REALLY did.  My husband is from Arkansas and I lived in the south much of my life.... so finding out there was a Southern restaurant in Vegas made us very excited.  I also love crab legs so I was doubly excited to try the AYCE on Monday night.

I have to say that the crab legs were probably some of the absolute best crab legs I've ever had.  They were very meaty.... no flimsy ones in the bunch (and believe me, we ate a BUNCH!).  Our waitress was also very nice.

That's where the good part stopped, though.  The restaurant itself is in dire need of a good cleaning.  It feels dingy and dirty.  We were seated right by a ""waterfall,"" which was a joke.... just embarrassing, really.  PVC pipes barely pushing out a trickle of water into a cement tub of chipped paint.  I think they would be better to just board up the windows so no one could see that thing.

The salad bar is pretty much a joke too.  As others have mentioned, it doesn't have a whole lot of items on it, and those that are, are questionable.  Not exactly fresh looking.

And with a name like the ""Hush Puppy,"" I would expect some REALLY GOOD hush puppies, but no... they were just pretty ""meh.""

Maybe if I were in the mood for crab legs, I'd go back... but really there are enough places in town that serve pretty good crab legs and also have a nice ambiance...  I'd probably just go to one of those instead.  Still looking for a great Southern place here in Vegas...",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,1,1,2,DeGtaNWdNGC12WMIR8VfjQ

530879,2009-10-27,1,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"I've been to this establishment on random occasions for 15 plus years.  went back last night with a craving for their corn-meal breaded catfish.  as luck would have it, sunday nites are all you can eat catfish and breaded shrimp.  fried heaven, here i come.
the decor is, meh, fake waterfall, unkempt outside, not one of those, whoa, eat and be seen kind of places, but it has been in business for alot of years owing to the quality of food they serve.  service was mediocre at best, just as you'd expect at a long-term mom and pop place in vegas that felt confident it no longer had to compete with places on the strip
we ordered the all you can eat for the night.  we were first served with hush puppies, now conveniently fried ""bulllet-shaped"". WTF? what happened to the old fashioned deep fried, round-shaped balls of corn meal and goodness they used to serve?  i guess the kitchen finally got automation and now they come out like artificially formed mini-hot dogs.  the upside is they are served with honey-sweet butter, perfect for dipping in.

on to the salad bar, the cole slaw was vintage, not too sweet, not too vinegary, salad bar was basic but kept thankfully free of the brown, lettuce and chunks of leftover heads that no one wants to chop up.  In addition, they kept the salad bar stocked and made sure there were no other ""add ons"" i.e. no plunkets of tomato in your ranch dressing carried over by some lazy careless guest.  i hate that.
 
the seafood was served hot with homemade tartur sauce. they serve all you can eat crab legs on mondays for what it is worth.  if it's any help, the tourists we saw on sun night who opted to order a bucket  were working to glean every piece of meat off the small crab legs  they ordered on the off night.
 All in all for what it was, very filling, not at all romantic, and nothing memorable, but decent food that doesn't make you sick. that should count for something. 
As a plus, the catfish is very well filleted, no worry about a bone, ever, which is good to me. Plus they have the recipe for iced T down, awesome! Last thing to mention for all you catfish/fried shrimp lovers $12.50 for all you can possibly eat on a Sunday night when you don't want to cook.

612150,2014-08-14,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Short: Mediocre food at best--mostly frozen/premade. Is pretty run-down inside. AYCE is decent, but you're better off at nearby buffets for better food.

Long: My family has a long-time tradition of going to this place since since it opened in the 70's, and it's gone plenty downhill from there. I don't know if it has changed owners, or the owner just doesn't care anymore. 
I've been here several times in the last couple years, each time a disappointment.
The last time--last night, to this review--I came here as it opened and was seated quickly. Luckily, I was seated near the window because last time I was more inside and this place gets gloomy and dark without sunlight. Odd that it's only open at night. Walls have chipping paint--probably both aesthetically, and they don't paint the place. Plates and silverware is old and cheap. 
The salad bar is a good example of this place. Canned food you can find anywhere. It looks like it was put up in an emergency with random places, and a couple coolers, but it's been like that for years. I've been to terrible small buffets with a better salad bar.
Waiter was prompt and manager was kind, but a bit unmotivated and dull. It was Wednesday, so I ordered the AYCE BBQ baby back ribs with catfish and shrimp and fries for $15.95. Good price at the start.
Was served their ""special"" hush puppies, which were bland at best. It's just fluffed corn-bread fried and served with a honey-butter. No seasoning, nothing on the inside. Just cornmeal. Dull and drab. At least they were free.
My food came, and with surprisingly large proportions; half rack of ribs, a filet of fried catfish, and a couple shrimp with a side of fries.
The shrimp were the butterfly/panko style, pulled from the freezer and fried. No seasoning, served burning hot.
Catfish is one of the few handmade items on the menu, but it's just catfish tossed in cornmeal and fried to a whitish-yellow. Not a golden brown. Oh, and burning hot. No seasoning, not marinated, not even salted. Just cornmeal.
Ribs are peculiar.  By how much oil was draining off them, I swear they were deep-fried, but then they were grilled for a second before being served.  They were seasoned... barely, as the seasoning fell off. I don't know if they were marinated or smoked as I couldn't tell. Perhaps they're from a bag, then fried and grilled. I ordered the sauce on the side, and good thing too! The sauce was a sweet, tomato base. Not bad, but reminded me of sweet-and-sour sauce mixed with ketchup.
Fries were shoestring with salt and pepper. Not that crunchy. 
I've tried other things, and it's all either frozen to fried, not seasoned, or plain dull. Nothing terrible or disgusting, but just dull as white bread. 
I was hungry, so I went through a couple servings. Each time, I was served only part of the dish because the others weren't ready yet. No extra fries. And the return service was slow.

TL;DR: Is it worth it? Buffets in the area, either for lunch or with specials on the dinners provide better food. Someplace like the Carnival World buffet at the Rio. If you can't go that far, and interested in the specials... I guess go here. But don't go out of your way; there's nothing special here.

2 stars because you won't get sick--at least they can fry foods enough. Otherwise, I recommend not going here.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,2,asrDUX1Ry50NzxytyA_4mA

731667,2013-06-08,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"My wife and I have been fans of The Hush Puppy since we discovered them nearly a decade ago.  Sadly, due to issues with my health and other factors we haven't been out to eat very much at all this past few years, but that is changing, so we were really stoked to make The Hush Puppy the place for our 10th anniversary dinner.

They still have the same great specials which drew us to them to begin with; namely, the all-you-can-eat shrimp and catfish, with oysters and clam strips added for only a couple dollars more on Thursdays.  Sadly, I think the quality of the seafood has declined in the last few years, but everything was certainly still palatable and the oysters are still my favorite.  My personal theory is that the destruction of the Gulf of Mexico due to the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster may have a lot to do with this.  Since their prices haven't increased much at all, they may be sourcing their product from China or elsewhere now out of sheer necessity.  They also no longer offer frozen margaritas or mudslides like they used to.  The alcoholic beverages are now only beer and wines and I'm not really partial to either, so we stuck with Diet Coke and tea.

The salad bar is also very limited now, and one thing which I found REALLY weird was that the only option for onions was whole entire scallions.  Not chopped up into little bits, but the whole 7-inch stalk from green end to white.  The pecan pie we had was good, but to be honest it was a bit overbaked.

Our server was a real sweetheart, and I had no problem tipping 25% rather than the normal 15.  I didn't get her name, but she was very attentive and friendly and earned every penny despite some shortcomings with the food.

I give this establishment a 4-star review in spite of everything because I think that The Hush Puppy is still doing their best to deliver good food at a reasonable price in spite of likely problems with sourcing product and the fact that the Las Vegas economy is in generally horrible shape.  I think if more people would support them, it would help them to survive and thrive in spite of all of this.

Give them a shot, and I sincerely hope that you will enjoy them as much as my wife and I have since 2003.",Y8EOLNPT_UD0LsGsgXMR8g,1,0,4,oo2f51eie-dVf2v5HE4pPA

It was pretty tasty, the sides were good and our waitress was very prompt. What makes my experience only a 3 star one is the thing they called a salad bar.  They had it tucked in this large alcove of a room. The carpet was deeply stained and it had an unclean look about it.

The salad bar area is a little rickety and like something out of 1985, but then again, the entire place is probably from 1985 and has had no upgrades since then.  So the ambience is very dated.  But who cares.  Food is food.

The food is great.  I always get the shrimp.  Absolutely no complaints.  The macaroni salad from the salad bar is great.

Service is hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a good waitress who is attentive.  Sometimes you get a stupid one who couldn't do her job right even if she only had one guest.  But nevertheless, the food gets to the table hot, it tastes good, and many of the options are all-you-can-eat.

The place is usually busy at peak hours and there have been a few times we can't get a seat.  But when I have called ahead in the past, the receptionist just tells us to ""come on down"" and doesn't take reservations?  Bad policy.

I got to try the New York 10oz steak, fried frog legs, fried green tomatoes, fried alligator tail, fried oyster, shrimp, and catfish (both freshwater and farm-raised, farm raised my favorite). Everything was great.
I want to particularly say that the shrimp were seasoned with an extra kick, and that the steak was the best I've ever had on a budget-- under $30 and bursting with juicy flavor.
The sauces were all on point, and the tartar sauce was sweeter than expected.
The fries were good but not special.

First, let me say that my wife is from the back woods of Texas.... she used to literally catch and fry catfish right out of the pond out back growing up.... and she loves that catfish here! We come to Vegas once or twice a year... and we always come to The Hush Puppy at least once during our stay. The all you can eat catfish is the absolute best. Crispy, perfectly seasoned and not too greasy or fishy. I prefer the freshwater, but the farm-raised is excellent too. The hush puppies are fantastic as are the greens!.... and the sweet tea!

Last time we visited, we spoke with John Perez (one of the owners) who introduced himself and gave us some personal attention with a complimentary desert... the homemade sweet potato pie ala mode.

First off they have different specialties ranging on the different days. AYCE BBQ ribs on Wednesday's, and the seafeast on Thursday's are among the more popular ones. My favorite is the seafeast as it come with catfish, fried shrimp, fried oysters, fried clams and the boiled shrimp, and it comes with endless fries too - on top of that there's an open salad bar with potato salad/ macaroni salad/ and others! Hits the spot every time, and if there's room for dessert their pecan pies are one of the best in Vegas. 
Run by John, he is the most caring and thoughtful manager I've come across in the restaurant business.

The only thing I would suggest is someone tidy up the salad bar.  It was around 930pm and they close at 1030pm, but regardless of time/closing the area should be kept clean.  They have lots of sides at the salad bar to enjoy, but the area was too messy.  Not appealing to me at all.  If the salad bar was up to par, easy 5 stars would have been given!

One can easily get addicted to the hush puppies with honey butter. Or shall I say honey butter with hush puppies.  It's as though these two need to coexist in flavor.  I tried the hush puppy alone and you just can't indulge without the butter.  Now, if you're expecting a Long John Silver kind of hush puppy, this is not it.  It's more like a yummy corn meal concoction shaped like a cocktail sausage.  This was served hot n fresh while we waited for our order.  One can easily fill up on these before the entrees arrive. 
The server was friendly but the place was really busy.   You get one trip to the salad bar and that was fine.   The plates are nicely chilled and there are a few mayonnaise based salads like Mac salad, potato salad, some kind of kraut (?) salad and of course, green salad fixins'.  It was all delicious. 
I ordered the award winning gumbo made with turkey.  I didn't see okra in this soup but it had the right amount of flavor and saltiness that I would recommend it.  Different and unique for sure.  Now comes the actual entrée.  We decided to be adventurous and order the platter which included alligator meat, farm raised catfish, fried oysters.    Like the old adage, ""It tastes like chicken"" is true about the 'gator meat.  Yes, even my son will have bragging rights that he ate alligator and actually liked it.  It looked like a chicken nugget.  He also ordered a grilled cheese and really enjoyed it.  
I'm not a fan of any farm raised fish, however, the entree came with it.  The catfish was crispy coated in a cornmeal crust and fried just right with no greasy residue, perfect accompanied with tartar sauce.
Note: tartar sauce does not arrive with your meal.  You need to pick that up at the salad bar.  
So if you have a hankering for fried Bayou type of food, check this place out.  It's not Cajun spicy at all though.  Next time, I will def order the snow crab legs which I heard are flown in from Canada.  This restaurant has some uniquely prepared signature dishes like their hush puppies, alligator meat, catfish and gumbo that would bring me back. It would be nice to have some low cal offerings too, healthier salads or signature desserts.

For starters if you pass this place on the street you probably won't want to stop but let me tell you that will be your first mistake.  This place is like they pulled it out of the deep south and brought everything including the building up to Vegas.  Let's start with there special items.  Hush puppies and Fish... I don't eat the fish but have eaten it and they have the best Dang Catfish there is... probably better than you could get say down in Louisianan.  It's all the rave you hear about and see up here on Yelp.  The Hush Puppies or Corn muffins or whatever they are ... Absolutely the best thing you can have (oh they are on the house might I say)  Just like Mom or Grandma making your favorite homemade muffin or bread and giving you a piece right out of the oven... WOW... I want one now...... Ask for the honey butter for those baby's.... OK... now for the good stuff... my meal experience.  I get the New York Steak and Vicki has the Crab legs... First the Crab... Vicki is a connoisseur or aficionado on Crab legs... I never seen such a small thin woman put away so much crab but she can... . she says "" The Crab is probably the very best Crab I have eaten and yes almost as good as  RM Seafood (Rick Moonen's) Place at the Mandalay Bay.... You get the crab in a $20 form of for just $5 bucks more you can have double.  I have tried some of hers and it is OFF THE CHAIN good... Now for the finale...the New York Strip... I get that and a Baked Tater and it comes with a piece of Corn On The Cob... The Hush Puppy's Strip is without a doubt,  the best Steak I have had in all of VEGAS.... Hands Down... No Joke... writing about makes me want one now.... Let me tell you I am a country boy and I grew up eating every kind of steak.  Iv'e also had quite a few here in Vegas. The Hush Puppy's Strip is so flavorful it's rediculous.  Every last bite just melts in your mouth.  If you love steak this is one you absolutly have to try.   I have had one better steak in Vegas and it was at RM Seafood (Rick Moonen's Place)  but let's be fair it was the Felet of Minion Oscar style... and that is not just a steak!  And if you want to Look at my review of RM Seafood it is reviewed under my name.  .. any way... Hush Puppies is my choice for that deep south soulfood that you can only get in Vegas at The Hush Puppie....Oh I almost forgot an all you can eat Down Home Country Cooking Salad bar before the meal that would make Grandma say Hallelujah... ~Vegas Rob",_EDOfw42-7xfWZu4sad97g,1,0,5,dk6zwreqzWr3D0JRrLTnGA

1641800,2017-08-25,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Absolutely on-point authentic. And very tasty ... if you're down for it.

DidCha-eatYet? Well welcome South brother cuz we got da fixins! Ohyah.

Those unfamiliar with this type of cuisine & venue might be in for a bit of a shock! This night's special was an AYCE seafood platter. 

Datadbe ""fried shrimp, fried catfish, fried oysters, fried clams, French fries, (fried) hush-puppies, super-sweet cole slaw and salad bar. Fifty-cent extra for collard greens. Your iced tea and gooey-when-hot pecan pie not included. 

Btw, better order ""UN-sweet tea."" Say the UN real loud now ya'll. Because, in the South, a tall glass of sweet tea generally contains a five-pound bag of sugar.

The key cuisine-concept here, obviously, is ... fried. Old-school deep South = a lotta deep fried greasy-goodness grub fo da poor workin' man.

Having spent a good bit of my years in the coastal South, I've likely downed thousands of hush-puppies in at least fifty places on this line of cuisine. Some of those joints were utterly fantastic, more than a few utterly nasty-greasy. So I have a rock-solid baseline from which to compare.

To me, this place is very, very authentic in almost every aspect. 

This venue is not ""presenting a concept."" These people know the real deal - cuz they good people from Texarkana - and they've replicated it in full, right here on West Charleston.

The décor, while quite well-kept, is pretty much on-the-mark with many a typical Deep South venue of this ilk: distressed wood-plank Hooters-style crab shack interior, with a good bit of Cracker Barrel motif slung about the walls & shelves. All that was missing was a heavy dose of insert-your-local-favorite-SEC-football-team-here flags & bric-brac. Thick oval bake-ware plastic plates in all of the available high-school cafeteria pastel colors. Fetch yo chilled salad plate outo' a cooler - that was probably used 40 years ago at an Arkansas gas station to chill Coca-Colas in tall glass bottles. Ice cold! Even the tiny upcharge for collard greens exactly replicates what many such Southern venues extract. 

All of this absolutely on-point authentic, but if you are looking for swank, you need to take yo @ss on uptown, ya-hear?

(Full disclosure: In the South, this type of restaurant can actually surface anywhere, in any kind of low-rent venue, in any part of town and with minimal decor & fixtures. I mean the walls may be dirty for lack of paint! The absolutely best I ever had ... and it WAS excellent ... and the cheapest ... was a sorta-broken-chairs-n-tables joint smack-dab in the middle of 'the poor-side of town.')

The background music, at acceptable-volume, was Sunny 106.5 Vegas, heavy on 80s up-tempo pop.

While I was in this space I actually forgot for a while I was even IN Vegas. You probably will too.

On to the grub. 

The salad bar was very satisfying. True to these venues, salad fixins were minimal: black olives, tomatoes, cheese, croutons, cukes and such. Dressing in squeeze bottles. I didn't see any lil gray raw oysters, a usual offering. But I'm good with that.

The hush-puppies (hot little crispy-fried balls/footballs of highly-sweetened cornmeal) were very soft, very lightly fried. Much better than average; some places just fry them up hard-as-a-freakin-marble. Best eaten dipped in butter.

When it comes to the fried seafood, the target is ""battered but not too much batter, tasty-greasy-goodness but not nasty-greasy."" Most of this was also on-point, but the oysters were a bit too small, and a bit too battered & oily. No surprise, I suppose, since oysters are the highest-ticket material here. But I am ALL about fried oysters, so this was a bit of a letdown.

Collard greens. The true test is ""earthy."" Collards tend to absorb a lot of flavor and nutrients from the ground. Look it up - they are durn good for you! Collards should almost taste like they have a bit of dirt in them. I find them best with salt and malt vinegar. These were well above average, quite the trick given there's no solid Southern topsoil anywhere near.

THE AYCE came in at $19.45, base. But you can order regular single-serve platters with AYCE salad bar here in the $12 range.

CONCLUSIONS: If you've never tried these sorts of eats, give it a whirl. And then you can scratch it off your bucket list. One visit and you'll know if you're down for more of it ... or if it's not to-your-likin. 

As for me, Daddy-likes!",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,0,1,5,ksGscfF5N9UQUoNDcVkv1Q

We arrived there around 6:30p and that place was jam-packed. There was no where to sit inside, people were waiting outside, but since it was in the middle of winter, we all stuffed our bodies inside and it was so hard to get around. But you weren't cold that's for sure. 

The hostess was a bit rude, but all the other staff were really nice and helpful. How can a restaurant put a hostess up front to greet people with ""how many? well...you're going to have to have a seat and wait because we have no tables."" and not..""Hi, good evening, how many are in your party? Can i have your name? We will call you when there is a table ready?"" --seriously its not so hard. i wanted to slap that hostess. But on a brighter note....we were finally seated and ready to eat.

They're kind of small and don't have as much flavor as I'd like, but I guess I really shouldn't complain about the catfish in the desert lol.

We went on a week night & the place was pretty much dead, so there was definitely not a problem with waiting for a table.  Even though there were only a hand-full of diners, the service was pretty weak.

The salad bar was pretty sad too and didn't look like anyone maintained cleanliness. Might be helpful to put the same items on both sides - makes it easy to maneuver and avoid spills. I did like how they kept plates chilled for it though. 

Our service was good and our waitress did her job. Sadly, we've lost our craving for this place. It just isn't the same.

Note: Despite what time your stomach says let's eat, this place opens at 5 p.m. - we went at 3 with ready bellies the day before and had sour faces :(",BOMiDxX9f_2YkJJTh_Ljmw,1,0,2,Rf9B17WALRa4C7A8r9teqg

When we walked in, it reminded me of an older Red Lobster wanna be with lots of rooms. The waitress was not terribly friendly. She was going through the motions. I wonder if she was overwhelmed by the size of the group. 

On my end of the table, most of us had the all you can eat seafood platter. It consisted of fried shrimps, clams, fish and oysters and French fries. The French fries were cold and everything else was lukewarm. It had an feel of glorified fast food. My husband was sick (kept having to go to the bathroom) all night.

We ordered the food, and it arrived. My chicken was undercooked my wife and stepson food was unseasoned, the French fries were cold on both our plates.

1938207,2016-04-26,1,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,Wasn't real impressed. The place was very outdated and reminded me of a place I may have gone to as a child but as an adult I now know there are better choices for food out there. The salad bar was very tiny and the pasta salad that I tried had way too much Italian dressing dumped on it. The lettuce for my salad was very fresh and crisp and tasted very good just wish there were more options of what to put on it. Half the containers for dressing weren't label on the bar. My guess is that half of them were ranch and the other half Italian. Would have been nice to have known for sure though. The hush puppies were good but definitely not good enough to warrant another trip back here. I ordered the frog legs and Alligator tails combination plate and had corn with it. I was very excited to try something new. I've never had frog legs or Alligator before but it was disappointing. The frog legs tasted like skimpy chicken legs that weren't as tender as chicken. The ratio of batter to frog legs was not a good mixture. Too much batter that was. Would have preferred to either have bigger legs or less batter. The Alligator tail was nothing special. No real flavor. I won't be coming back for either of those. I ordered a glass of wine and it was a very small glass filled to the top of very cheap tasting wine. Fortunately it was only $4 so yeah maybe it just was cheap wine. I was tempted to order some oysters for an appetizer but for almost $2/oyster I could do without. Considering I can get them cheaper at a fancier restaurant than this one. All and all I wasn't impressed and don't plan on coming back.,yFelAlXODSB_Hy2PyHXViA,1,0,2,LtWFQOxyclHVxuJrd2J34g

1993559,2014-06-02,3,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"GUMBO AND FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, Y'ALL! 
That's all you need to know about this place; come here for those items specifically!

What so many other reviews don't mention is that this place HAS A DRIVE THRU. That's right- you don't need to go in with a group or plan a family dinner around their evening-only hours, just drive up and get what you want and go! Dishes are made fresh, so expect a reasonable 8-10 minute wait time in the comfort of your vehicle.

On first visit, I ordered #4 (3 piece ""snackbox"" of fried catfish plus hush puppies and fries), a side of gumbo ($5 for a small portion), and the fried green tomatoes appetizer ($3 for 6 slices, seasonal availability). Total meal was about $15, not bad for what would ultimately be 2 meals for me.

Was pleasantly surprised by quality- fish was freshly fried, batter didn't fall off, wasn't too greasy and oil didn't taste old. Fries were a bit on the soggy side but had good flavor, seemed to have a touch of batter to them. Hush puppies were weird, didn't eat them- strange oblong shape and no flavor. Disappointed that the 3 piece order was served with only one tiny cup of tartar sauce- it was tasty,  wished there was more. Portion for price (meal is about $6) was good, didn't come close to finishing.

Now for the real surprises- the GUMBO and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.
The gumbo was a small portion for the price but packed with sausage and crawfish. Flavor was on par with Weeziana's, just up the street, but her pricing for portion is  better ($10 gets you a tureen!).
Fried green tomatoes were delish- batter was different from what the fish is breaded in and more mild, and they're served with a delightful dipping sauce. Will continue come back just for these two dishes!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,4,4,7q91L71RJHp4wW4qrPTjrg

I was really disappointed my most recent visit here, especially since I really enjoyed my experience the last time I was in. I came here with my family for my birthday dinner because they have the crab leg special. Crab legs are one of my favorite foods, and I always try to get them every year on my birthday. Hush Puppy has 2.5lbs of snow crab legs every day for $26.99. This includes a side and a trip to the Sysco salad bar, as I like to call it.

First things first, they shoved our party of 7 in a small ass room, on the closed side of the dining room. There was plenty of other seating on the other side of the OPEN restaurant, so I am not sure why they did that. This was annoying for two reasons. The first being that because there was not much room to maneuver, it was hard for everyone to get in/out to go to the salad bar.  And the second is because this resulted in us being pretty much ignored throughout the whole meal. I mean how would you even remember we were there? Our server never came by to clear off salad plates, or offer refills on drinks. When our food came out, some older guy not wearing a uniform dropped our food off to us. The crab legs that I was so looking forward to, came out lukewarm and they didn't taste fresh which was a big let down. Other people in my group ordered the AYCE fish platter that comes with fried shrimp, oysters, clams and cat fish. Their food was a hit or miss. Somethings came out cold and others fresh out of the fryer. I enjoyed the fried shrimp and the oysters, the few pieces that I did get to try. 7 out of 7 people agreed that we would not be back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,6,2,2,4BoDExkD1vVd4WVbE3q_0A

I tried the fried butterflied jumbo shrimp, it was fried shrimp, nothing more than that. The crispy fries that accompanied the shrimp were  really crispy and good.

2207357,2009-11-14,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"ALMOST HALF AS GOOD AS RED LOBSTER
Each year I'm elated to see that my very favorite restaurant, Red Lobster, is voted ""Number 1 Seafood Restaurant"" in the Las Vegas Weekly Best of Las Vegas poll. So when I done found out that there was a place that locals thought was better'n Red Lobster, I just had to check it out.

For starters, we got what looked like mini-corn dogs without the stick. I was disappointed to find there was no finely ground meat-in-a-tube inside but just corn meal. That's when I realized that we never ordered mini-corn dogs but that these were the restaurant's namesake HUSH PUPPIES. Um, well, I suppose these are corn dogs, er, hush puppies because they are two-bite corn meal nuggets, but they sure don't seem like the hush puppies that I'm used to. Hell, Long John Silvers has traditional hush puppies that are more like the real deal. These look like a yellow robot rabbit vacated it's bowels into a red plastic, wax paper lined basket. But hell, I'll eat fried bull testicles (aka Rocky Mountain Oysters) so why not eat yellow robot rabbit turds? With the honey butter that they supply, they actually have a subtle pleasant taste to them, if you're looking for something sweet and fried that is.

The reason we went to the Hush Puppy is that it was billed as a Louisiana style restaurant. Visions of Cajun and Creole danced in our heads on our way over (which made driving quite a chore... no more White Widow Kush before operating light-heavy machinery). When we got there we were pleasantly surprised that it was Cajun without the Creole, or more like Creole without the Cajun. 

The FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were actually quite good and were on special at $2.95. They are regularly $4.95 which would have been a rip off, but for $2.95 it was okay. And they do have GUMBO as an appetizer for $6.95. It comes in a bowl and you can add ALL YOU CAN EAT SALAD BAR for $2.95 which makes it a meal.

Well, let's talk about the Salad Bar. It was sad. I would say that it was basic, but it didn't even have Broccoli or Cauliflower. In other Yelp reviews I read that people were happy that it was clean and there wasn't tomatoes in the dressing and such. Yeah, I'd be happy about that, too, but that doesn't UP the star rating, it just keeps it from going down. The selections on the Salad Bar were extremely limited. (There was an area that could have held 6 more pots of dressing or ingredients that was basically just ice covered by whole leaves of a leafy lettuce which was just a space filler. They have the room, they don't have the desire to put more out.) The one saving grace on the salad bar was the COLE SLAW. It's slightly more coarse than KFC cole slaw and a little less sweet, which makes it perfect in my book. Cole Slaw is one of those dishes that people regularly disagree on. It seems to depend on how you had it when you grew up, and the cole slaw here is just the way I like it. But the rest of the salad bar is sub-par.

But if this is a Louisiana or Cajun or Creole place, what was seriously LACKING was anything like JAMBALAYA or ETOUFFEE. Yes, they have ALLIGATOR TAIL and FROG LEGS, but where's the classic dishes? Why not offer them?

My girlfriend ordered the BLACKENED CATFISH with BAKED POTATO and CORN ON THE COB. The Blackened Catfish was actually very good. The blackening tasted very good (although I like extra blackening and can always use a little more.) A little sprinkle of salt really brought out the flavor and it is a dish that I would recommend. The baked potato was overdone, indicative of mass cooking them and keeping them in a warmer too long. The worst part of her meal was the ICE COLD CORN ON THE COB. Blech. One bite and it was ""NO THANKS!"" That's a serious lack of attention to detail on the kitchen staff. (I don't expect the waitress to notice the temperature of something like that.)

If you are looking for large quantities of FRIED SEAFOOD at a very reasonable price, there are a lot of options. ALL YOU CAN EAT FRIED CATFISH (Fillets or Fiddlers, which are small whole catfish) and ALL YOU CAN EAT SHRIMP, or a combination of two of the above for $12.50. Most people are done with AYCE Fried Food once they're out of high school (or maybe college for some), but if that's your thing, then it sounds like it's quite a deal here. They do have AYCE CRAB LEGS on Monday night (for something like $24) but my experience wasn't good enough to merit a return trip so I won't be finding out what a deal it is.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't eat here and I understand how places like these can grab a loyal local patronage. For me, there are way too many much better places to eat that I can't imagine coming back on my own volition. By the way, pulling out of the parking lot we had already come to our verdict, but by the time we got home, my girlfriend had a very upset stomach that lasted through the night. I'm sure it was just luck of the draw but it ended up being the final straw.

So we're always on the lookout for good southern cooking...and Cracker Barrel is not it!Tonight was our first time at The Hush Puppy. Great service, very good food. More on that. 

The hush puppies are the best we've had since 42nd Street Oyster Bar in Raleigh. The honey butter was perfect. Not too much honey but just enough. Light, crisp, lovely.

We had the fried green tomato appetizer to start. Our only complaint was they don't jazz it up with Tabasco before frying like my husband prepares his but they do provide hot sauce on the table. Then my husband got the Bayou Platter with shrimp, alligator, catfish and oysters. I got the #4 senior plate. Both included a trip to the salad bar.

I don't normally rave about salad bars but I will this one. The mixed greens were beyond fresh. The pickled tomatillos (I believe that's what they were) were to die for as was their fresh-every-day-at-4:00 cole slaw. You could tell the dressings were made fresh in-house, not out of a bottle. They were delicious and very cold as was the tartar sauce. Having had food poisoning from warm tartar sauce back in NC, I am very leery of it and learned how to make it at home. Normally I will not eat it out. I had no qualms about eating this because it tasted very fresh and it was chilled right there at the salad bar.

However, we can't rave about the alligator or oysters. They weren't that good. The alligator was extremely rubbery and chewy. But who knows, maybe that's just alligator. My husband has never failed to eat all his fried oysters, he loves them, but he left one tonight. 

The catfish, however, was excellent. One other review complained about the excessive usage of salt on the catfish but we couldn't detect any at all. Maybe we got someone else's no-salt order. We had to add some. My butterflied shrimp on the senior plate were very good. I don't believe they were the frozen ones you get in other restaurants. These tasted like they were hand breaded just before frying.

Best of the best, though, was the southern iced tea. This was not made from powder. It's good old southern sweet tea like your mama once made that has been boiled and the sugar added to melt while it is still hot. If you don't like ""turn your teeth inside out sweet"" order it half with unsweetened. They are glad to accommodate.

All in all, a very good meal and we will be back when we get a hankering for good old down home cooking.",8bKAgbdjDqa2aQT55nxkww,1,0,4,r5w1-vZEUklyIy6AW6Dxvw

Stinky smelly catfish is not what you expect to eat at a restaurant where the parking lot is jam packed every night. I don't get it!! Out of our table of five only one person had an acceptable meal. I had the combo meal with fried Catfish and fried shrimp. Shrimp were acceptable, but the Catfish - terrible! And it wasen't just me. Four out of five of us did NOT like our meals. My brother had the grilled Catfish and it was fine. The rest of us had the fried and it was horrible. I would rather lick someones feet that has been hiking for 100 miles than eat at this restaurant again. The couple at the table next to us left half their meals and boogied out of there also. And, what's with the things they call Hush Puppies? They are just fried corn bread. Man oh man, Long John Silvers has better (not great) Hush Puppies!  NEVER AGAIN FOLKS!!! I don't know what these farm raised Catfish are being feed. The only thing I can think of is that they are fed effluent from a sewage plant that is nearby.

We went on a Wednesday night at 830pm. We were seated immediately. There was probably 3 other tables and 1 waitress. 

For appetizers, we ordered a cup of seafood gumbo, fried oysters, and clam strips. The hush puppies were incredible. We had to refrain from eating too many of those. They were too addicting. 

For entrees we ordered the seafood platter with fries and 2.5lbs of snow crab platter with collard greens. Both of the entrees came with the salad bar. The salad bar was simple and we loved it. 

EVERYTHING we had was tasty and fabulous. My favorite was seafood gumbo and snow crab platter. 

I promised a plate for a friend of mine but I was not sure what to get. By suggestion from the waitress, I ordered the catfish/shrimp combo dinner and a slice of pecan pie to go. Great choice! My friend enjoyed his meal as well.

Their menu has unlimited fish options and most of their entrees come with a visit to the salad bar, which will fill you up before you even get your entree! There are plenty of options for everyone to choose from and be satisfied. 

The salad bar has a pretty basic selection of salad ingredients. The standouts there are the pickles, if you're into that (which I am), and their homemade dressings. 

Their menu is divided into different sections. They have an all-you-can-eat catfish section that comes with fries if you really want to grub. I myself wasn't up for the challenge, so I got a House Specialty: the Cajun Fantasy w/ blackened catfish, shrimp, and fried alligator tail (with options to have tilapia as the main fish and fried oysters instead of alligator tail). If you're curious, the alligator tail tastes like chicken pretty much. Nothing too crazy. Served with hush puppies and your choice of baked potato, fries, corn cobbette, or collard greens. 

If you're not into seafood they also have beef or chicken options on the menu.

2519275,2011-04-04,2,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Rating this place is almost unfair. First off...I have an AYCE fetish. I just can't resist it, and I usually can't control myself once I'm there.

Just like Chantel said...""If we were in another state...but we're in Vegas so..."" Yea. My expectation go way down where AYCE is involved so if it is even decent I'm usually blown away. This place is definitely a pleasant surprise for the price. The service was friendly, and more than adequate for this style of dining.

We went on a Wednesday and had the AYCE ribs, which also includes AYCE catfish, shirmp, a side, hush puppies, and small salad bar, all for only $14.95! 
The hush puppies were decent because they are served with honey butter, but don't have anything on the inside like corn, onion or cracklin which are always included in a proper hush puppy, and I expected better when considering it is the establishment's namesake.
The star of the salad bar is the cole slaw. For those of you who love good slaw with something fried or grilled, this is the best i've had anywhere in Vegas.
We all disagreed as to who has the best ribs in town, but we all agreed that these were the best (& only) AYCE ribs ever, and well beyond what you expect out of a seafood restaurant. They are small, smokey and sweet, not overcooked, but not the mush you get on most buffets.
The catfish was good but somewhat inconsistent. I am a fan of small whole fish(""fiddler's"" as they are called, which they have, but not as part of the daily special), but these are filets. The first batch we had was just OK, but when we got the second round they were greasier, oilier, and had a great salty taste that went great with the sweet slaw, tartar, and an ice cold Abita. 
The shrimp were just fried shrimp, but surprisingly plump. 
For a side you can get fries or greens. If you are a fan of collards, you HAVE to go here. These are the only greens I've ever had in a restaurant that rival those made by my family in GA. Al dente without being crunchy or mushy, with tons of pork in the mix. 
Rather than put everything out Buffet style the serve each order family style, so it's fresh when you get it.
In addition to the all you can eat we wanted to sample some of the more unique southern fare, that you often can't find in Vegas without paying an arm and a leg.
Frog legs. Great taste, with light breading, and not overcooked like they usually are. $6.95
Fried green tomatoes, nice small thinly sliced, and properly breaded, but they just didn't have the right taste. They were perfectly executed with remoulade but the batter just needs more spices to it. $4.95
Also...Cheapest oysters in Vegas: $9.95 for a dozen. They aren't the best i've had in Vegas, but for the price they get the job done.
Fried alligator, which was served in nugget form. Here again the execution was great, and the gator meat tasted great but the breading just doesn't have the right spices to stand up to the dark oily meat so it seems flat tasting. $6.95
So, the 3 of us shared 4 appetizers, had 3 all you can eat meals, and 2 beers a piece and the bill was exactly $100.
I haven't been on a Monday yet for the AYCE crab legs, but i'm sure I will be back several times to try each of the daily specials so I'll update as I try more.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,3,2,4,Tc_BpEyOIN1OMJMoyXqugw
2523564,2015-05-07,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Went there for the 1st time on a Wednesday and had the Wednesday special - All you can eat Baby Back Ribs, Catfish, shrimp and salad bar. 

The salad bar was pretty small but delivered offering potato & macaroni salad, Cole slaw and your basic fresh Salad ingredients as well as tartar & cocktail sauce. I tried the potato & macaroni salad, but went heavy on the cole slaw adding some tartar sauce to it along with some salt & pepper at the table and it was pretty good.

The odd shaped hush puppies came to the table steaming hot along with some whipped airy honey butter and they were flavorful & good. However I definitely like Long John Silvers bigger round crunchy outer layered hush puppies a lot better.

The Baby back ribs were surprisingly VERY lean and meaty and did not disappoint. Make sure to ask for a side of BBQ sauce to deal with all the meat you will be getting.

The lightly battered Fried Shrimp turned out to be VERY disappointing as they were probably 50-60 count small shrimp that had been deveined and butterflied and heavily breaded despite the ""lightly breaded"" advertised description. I pealed all the breading off and there wasnt much shrimp to be had. I'd almost bet that this is a product that comes in frozen and they just deep fry them. Very disappointing and NO MATCH for the Fremont Casino's Friday Lunch Buffets BIG lightly hand breaded fried shrimp. 

The Fried Catfish was (as advertised) lightly floured and very good and hearty and no bones. I substituted collard greens for french fries and they were very good as well.

Overall it was pretty good and I am finally glad I went and tried it. I will definitely go back at some point and will bring a much bigger appetite with me and will be skipping the shrimp.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,1,1,4,TNl5PVG3RsqZOsxmHmTDiQ

Most entrees come with a side and the salad bar. The salad bar is one reason for the lack of a better rating. It's a poor excuse for a salad bar (not that I'm a huge fan of a salad bar). It's actually really quite disgusting. Every time I have been there it seems to be warm, not cool as a salad bar should be, and has a smell in the area that is unpleasant to say the least. I would never dream of getting any food from the salad bar, but they also put condiments on the bar, making it a necessary stop while dining. 

I love the colossal shrimp. They're  so good. The first time I visited, I was disappointed because they only give you 6 butterflied fried prawns. After eating, it was actually quite a nice portion, and delicious. I actually had a combination this evening with a blackened filet of tilapia and the colossal shrimp, and it is my new favorite. The hush puppies they give when seated are also very tasty, along with the honey butter they serve with it. 

My other issue; however, with the Hush Puppy is my guests' dishes... They are always dissatisfied! Most others are intrigued by the AYCE specials they have and order that. This evening, my guest was actually talked into ordering an AYCE catfish, fried, and peel-and-eat shrimp.  They piled on the peel-and-eat and cheap fried shrimp (nothing like the quality of the colossal) and only gave him 1 piece of catfish. When informing the server he was dissatisfied with the boiled shrimp, they returned again with a basket full of the cheap fried shrimp and only 1 piece of catfish. The shrimp are obviously cheaper, but it was so blatant each time with gobs of cheap shrimp and 1 piece of catfish.

All in all, I will be back to Hush Puppy. I love seafood and I know what to order. If I can offer any advice to fellow diners is to order anything BUT the AYCE specials..

2771969,2013-05-27,1,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Call me crazy, but I was expecting this place to have the best darn hushpuppies in town.... I was very mistaken. The hushpuppies were more like corn bread nuggets, nothing like the cornmeal fried delights that I'm used to. They were good... but they were disappointing at the same time.
I think they should rename this place ""Mediocre Southern Comfort Food.""  Most of the meal choices earn you a trip to their ""salad bar."" Yes.. I put salad bar in quotes because it offered only one choice of lettuce with few veggie toppings, but I will give them credit that they did have a large variety of dressings. 
Alligator tail: A good appetizer. The breaded deep fried nuggets of gator did not have any distinguishing flavors. I could have been eating fried chicken nuggets and I would not have known the difference. However, the breading did have good seasoning and the nuggets were crispy so that is a plus. 
The freshwater catfish was thinner and milder in flavor whereas the farm-raised catfish was thicker with a stronger flavor. Both preparations were a big disappointment. The breading was completely bland and the fried fillets weren't crispy. So it was an overall soggy flavorless dish. The only thing that made it palatable was the cocktail sauce that I dipped it in. If you ever had the opportunity to eat at Catfish Alley- this place pales in comparasion. 
The fried shrimp was a little better, but I could have gotten better fried shrimp from the Red Lobster. 
Plus side: the catfish/shrimp dishes are AYCE so if you have a large appetite you can eat your weight in fried seafood, but for me and my husband, we left full... but not satisfied.",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,1,1,3,vLVhET68DGvBmnmf6zfYQQ

This hometown comfortable eatery is best known for their AYCE catfish and shrimp, plus the seafood platter. They do offer blackened and char-grilled catfish, too. But, it's the fried catfish that really shines here. They have got to have the most flavorful catfish in the entire valley! It's well-cleaned, and lightly corn-breaded with a flavorful coating. If you're lucky enough to show up on a Thursday night, spend the extra $2 and get the all-you-can-eat seafood platter, which includes fried and broiled shrimp, catfish, oysters, and clams! We loved the kind service and helpful servers. It took a little longer than we wanted to get started. But, once we got going, the re-orders were all hot, fresh and double-sized. The hush puppies are sweet and delicious, especially with the served honey butter. A salad bar is included with the AYCE meals. It's not a huge salad bar, certainly no reason to show up for that alone. But, it does the job. Good potato and macaroni salads. Great cole slaw, too.

Upon entry, the place smelled of a boo-boo diaper, no exaggeration! Bad sign from the start. The place was rustic looking and seemed to have antique or very old furniture. Maybe that was the intended feel, I don't know. Menu options were fairly limited. I ordered seafood gumbo and crab legs appetizer. My friend ordered fried catfish and fries. 

A basket of hush puppies came. Booooo! Clearly by the picture I posted, they are not huge. They look like Jamaican festival bread and tasted like fake hot dog on-a-stick batter. The sweet butter didn't help. ""A"" for effort.

Our food came. Gumbo was just okay. I've never cooked it and bet mine would taste comparable. That's not saying much. Crab legs were sweet; that is, the parts I could enjoy. I ate ONE hot leg of the bunch. The rest were ice cold at the bottom and lukewarm up the rest. I even asked my friend to touch them to make sure. Yep, I was right. 

I sent them back and requested a new batch. The waitress comes back and says, ""Try these and see if they're better."" How about they were the same legs reboiled!! I broke a few to check for hot meat. Those same legs were broken. Lol! I said, ""They're the same legs but yes, they're warmer than the last."" Obviously, she wasn't concerned with her level of integrity with that lie. Then again, maybe the cooks made her believe the legs were a new batch. Whatever! I was already beyond hungry, the legs still were partially cold and I ate them anyway. I don't like sending food back and I was ready to get the hell out of there. 

The 2 stars is for effort. The owner or manager walked around and greeted people. That was nice. Staff was friendly and welcoming others as we left. As for my experience here...blahhh! I'll pass.",1PfEtkSwdXiyeIqExpeKOA,8,2,2,7IhnddzHWlbGE81eSsb0Eg

2863796,2010-05-21,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Before last week, my boyfriend and I had never been to Las Vegas, so I decided to do a little research of local restaurants that served seafood that were NOT buffets. We are both big crab and lobster buffs, and I wanted to find hot, fresh crab legs that hadn't been sitting in ice while lines of people annhilated them like they'd never seen food before. I came across reviews of this little ""hole in the wall"" establishment and wrote down the address. If you have a rental car, or are visiting someone with a car, it's perfect. However, a cab ride from a hotel on the strip will cost you 25 bucks to get there; a tad steep, but I think it was definitely worth every penny. 

We came there for one reason and one reason only: all you can eat crab legs. I can't say anything about their catfish or the salad bar, but after looking over the menu for the heck of it, they do have a large selection of seemingly authentic southern dishes; gator bites, fried oysters, etc. Also, the service is extremely friendly and very efficient; our waitress wouldnt let our crab plate get empty or the bucket for the shells too full, but she would always ask if were ready for another plate full so they wouldn't get cold. Even with tables everywhere, she never seemed flustered and made small talk with every table. 

The crab legs themselves were delicious; really large legs and claws and none of them short of meat. We also tried the Rio seafood buffet and the crab legs at the Hush Puppy were 10x better. A buffet is too scrambled with people fighting over crab legs, so to get them served to you whenever you want and as much as you want while theyre piping hot is a wonderful treat. The only downside, like previously mentioned, is how far it is from the strip. But, after eating what was quite possibly 10 pounds each, my boyfriend and I left full, satisfied, and extremely pleased with everything the Hush Puppy had to offer.

Throw in crawfish rice, collard greens, gumbo, fried green tomatoes, gator to back it up and you got yo'self a meal you haven't had in a long time.

Our meals included the self serve salad bar and I must say it was nicely stocked with essentials for a great salad and sides that complimented fish/seafood well. I'll add, being of southern roots myself, I'd wished they had some sort of sliced onions to make the ""fish fry"" complete. Nevertheless I was happy! Especially to see the beets! 

The crab legs arrived perfectly before the main course with drawn butter! They were very hot, meaty, and delicious! Shortly after the meals arrived hot and looking incredible. The kids and grown ups alike enjoyed the fresh fried fish! The cornmeal coating was light and crisp!   The fries it came with had the consistency of curly fries, but meatiness ( idk what's up with me and meat right now) of a regular fry which was a great cross! The ribs were actually really really good! My daughter is allergic to fish and was actually able to enjoy the ribs without swelling up like a puffer fish from poor sanitation practices! 

While fat, full, and trying not to drool, a handsome older gentleman named John stopped by to see if we needed medical attention... possibly because we turned into zombies that barely budged while resisting comatose. He was happy to know that we got our puppies hushed and we're satisfied. John was even as kind enough to send ice cream out to my babies, on the house! That's a lost art!

The waitress agreed to have manager deduct 50% of the salary crab leg entree. I was ok with that, but when she brought the adjusted bill back to the table, she didnt give me the itemized bill. My bad for not asking for it at that time. But I did call manager 10 minutes after I left and asked him to read the bill to me. Turns out I didnt get 50% off the $28.00 crab entree. I was given $6 off. I treated my family to dinner and overall I was embarrassed and four of the six of us were dissatisfied.

Monday nights also seem to be extremely crowded! I was fortunate to not have to wait so long in line since we got there early in the evening. I felt even more lucky as we were leaving.  TONS of people waiting for a seat.

We were set in what was almost a private dining room with our party of 8 people.  It was nice and cozy.  It was crab legs galore! And all you can eat.  The hush puppys with honey and butter were awesome!

My only complaint about this place is that the waiter was very sparse when it came to drinks, taking or initial order and drink refills.  We were keen to ask ahead of time when he would appear for more crab legs, so we weren't left wanting too long.

Parking seems to be an issue as well if you do not get there early... if you do plan on eating here, try to beat the crowd!

Our table of six finished three buckets. The key part is to eat the buckets real fast while the crabs are still warm. Once they start cooling down, they don't taste as good. In this case, you have to be the hare and leave the turtle in the dust.

The snow crabs that they serve are not your typical Chinese buffet cheap crabs. I am happy to say that these snow crabs, albeit not as good (less meat) than the Alaskan king crabs, are still very delicious. On a side note, they have some of the best cole slaw I have ever had in my life.

3326442,2016-08-01,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"I have a confession to make.  I went for the Hush Puppies.  Hush Puppies got their name back in the day when the dog would bark while you were cooking and the cook would ball up cornbread, throw it at them and uther, ""HUSH PUPPY"".

Honest, true story.

Let get down to the nitty and the gritty.

The Hush Puppy is a great casual family restaurant in which to dine. One of their most great tasting meal is their CATFISH.  It even comes in a Senior Special price at 10.95 which includes 2 pieces of CATFISH, Fries, Salad Bar and a drink.

The CATFISH

Although it was good, I usually get better CATFISH at The Hush Puppy on LAMB or NELLIS.  I can't remember which.  The thing is this one is now the closest to me. That one was the closet to me years ago.  

The FISH seemed to be over fried to the point where the meal was very hard and gritty.  That being said it still tasted good.  Either that or I was hungry

FRIES

I don't normally eat fries and these were no exception.  They were not only greasy, but, also, over cooked.  So much so they were more like FRENCH FRIES.  I offered them to my date he did even want them.

SALAD BAR

There were beets on the SALAD BAR.  Love Beets, Lemon, and Cucumber.  Could have used some red onion and maybe alphafa sprouts, I don't know how to spell it, but whose complaining it THE HUSH PUPPY.

Drink

It did just was it as supposed to do.  I was no longer thirsty.. Raspberry tea always hits the spot.  This, of course was endless refills.



Service

The waitress who served us made us fill at at home.   Serving us with a smile and great conversation. Not to mention helping us to select a meal with our budget.  Brought us our drinks is record time.   We went to get our salad and when we came back the bus person had dumped our drinks.   They were quickly replaced with the others when they realized the error.

The Five stars were for the service.  There of them maybe for the food.  I've taste better and I give them A for effort.  Perhaps I should go there on a better day.  WE all have those.",VwWiPX-epZ-jsEpGtywxWg,4,3,5,8H37N6wLz8v1p6jxNg4fTA

At first I was impressed with the mediocrely prepared food...it is decent. But the restaurant itself is grimy, has a mildew smell, and the standards of food are slipping more and more. I ordered the combination plate of catfish and shrimp--bottomless--the fish is CAKED in a hard corn meal batter. The fish and shrimp are overcooked. The greens tasted old--I've been cooking greens all of my adult life, and I know the difference between fresh greens, day old greens, and greens older then s few days. The greens I had with my meal were older than a few days. (C'mon, where's the respect for the food and the customer?). 

The hush puppies are over sweetened logs of fried batter. Please do not be mislead, these are not real hush puppies. To top it off, my sister-in-law ordered the crab legs, and about half way through eating them, a small long green flying insect came crawling out of the crab legs. Told the manager and he said, ""oh really"", then proceeded to ask how other members in our party was enjoying their meal.

I became a crab snob and wouldn't eat it anywhere else. The catfish is good, but used to be better when they offered it as a fiddler (whole fish), farm and fresh water raised option. Now they just have the thicker, mushy filet and the fiddler style. I personally liked the thinner, crispy filet catfish. The cornmeal they used on their fish is good. The hushpuppies and honey butter are addicting. The salad bar is usually always good. My mom goes nuts for the pickled green tomatos. The service is hit and miss. There are a few servers that have been there a while and are nice, but sometimes the newer ones are super bad and take forever. The ribs there are also very tastey. Sweet tea is very good as well.

This place houses the best hush puppies I've ever had in my entire life.

The hush puppies are served with the best honey butter I've ever tasted.  It's blended just right - enough honey mixed in with the butter so it just soaks into your hush puppy and makes a wonderful sinful bite of greasified heaven...yum.

On Monday nights this place has all you can eat crab leg nights.  When we lived in Vegas, our friends and I lived for Monday nights. It's the kind of all you can eat crab leg night where you know you have to take off your rings and watch so you don't get 'em all soppy and soaky from the wonderfully freshly steamed crab legs.

alligator tail is also very tasty. I like me some Ali tail, and hush puppies does not disappoint. Not too chewy, and not overly battered. Fantastic.

The manager John came back to our table and moved us to Penny's area. Penny was great as usual. John was very apologetic for Harold's behavior towards us. John is an A+ manager! We will continue to eat at this location. The food is always delicious.",gWxuXLY25gGGZl85Q2rgRw,0,0,4,VKq7BjW3pBJlApN_ckvKzA

The chicken tasted exactly like the pre cooked chicken you get in the bag, the one with the grill marks on it at the store that you buy next to the bolognie,ham and turkey. Rubbery and not seasoned good at all. Cocktail sauce, no good either. I lived in the south for 10 years, the hushpuppies were a good apptizer but i wouldnt call them hushpuppies. me and my fiance both left there with horrible stomach aches maybe the greese from the hushpuppys. I had 2 bites of the chicken. 2 stars because the baked potato was good. Waitress was friendly and removed the chicken plate from the bill.

They have the best hush puppies i've ever tasted and the

4014587,2015-06-04,5,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Kept hearing about The Hush Puppy for years from word of mouth mostly (they really don't do much advertising) and the wifey and I finally decided to pay a visit for a catfish fry!

Getting there is easy.  The parking lot for The Hush Puppy is HUGE!  Like you can park a church congregation huge.  My guess is on the busy days they really can pack the place!  That's a lot of fish and grease being consumed!

Interior of the restaurant is very eclectic with a mish-mash of design features which I can't place my hands on.  Some Native American hints here, some Asian inspired bamboo there, yet some Southern accents over there!  Restaurant is very spacious inside.  A large open dining room, what seems like another semi-outdoor dining space (?), and several smaller, more intimate rooms for families or smaller parties.  

Wifey and I came for one thing on the menu - AYCE catfish, what The Hush Puppy is popular for!  Wait, it's gluten-free catfish!  Even better I suppose?  For $14.95 a person you can have unlimited servings of fried farm-raised catfish fillets, something they call fiddlers (small whole catfish), or fried shrimp.  You can combine two of these choices for the same price.  Or for $13.95 you can have fried freshwater fish fillets (which I assume is still catfish), if you don't want farm raised.

We had a hard time choosing two options, so our waitress was kind enough to let us sample their three most popular one - fried farm-raised catfish, fried freshwater fish, and fried shrimp.  How nice of her!  With your AYCE you get a main side of French fries.  For an additional $0.50 you can sub in a baked potato, crawfish rice, corn, or collard greens.

With each AYCE meal, the salad bar comes included.  Now this salad bar is by no means one you find at your local Sweet Tomatoes, it's more akin to one at Cici's Pizza.  It's tiny but it has most of the fixings you would find for a basic salad.  There is a gem or two there though.  That green tomato salad/relish at the salad bar?  Delish!  House made coleslaw?  Tasty!  Also at the salad bar don't forget to get a helping (or two) of the freshly made tartar sauce, very good and pairs well with your fried goodies!  Also with each meal, your table will get a basket of complimentary hush puppies.  These really are different though, they aren't the round kind you get from Long John Silver's.  Something special, more oval shaped, and very light on the inside.  Delicious with some of the included honey butter!  Beats a plain roll that's for sure.

Didn't take very long for our AYCE meals to arrive, maybe 20 minutes or so.  Fried items were nice and fresh!  Luckily, The Hush Puppy changes its oil frequently and you can tell.  Everything was golden brown, not greasy, and the light batter on the catfish and shrimp wasn't too heavy.  Farm-raised catfish fillet was great, very flavorful with their light cornmeal-based breading.  The freshwater catfish fillet was good too, milder in flavor but still tasty.  Both of these were excellent with a squeeze of fresh lemon, a dash of Tabasco, another dash of some malt vinegar, and a dip into tartar sauce!  The fried shrimp were probably our least favorite item on the AYCE, came out fried right but the breading was a tad heavy.  More shrimp please, less bread!  These almost seem like the kind you buy from your local big-box superstore, industrial packed and ready to cook.

Wifey managed to get to a second plate of AYCE goodness before she hit her wall.  I got to a third plate, but both of those contained only the fried farm-raised and freshwater catfish fillets.  I can imagine all the gluten I avoided during my meal.  I smite you Celiac disease!  Although I'm sure those French fries didn't help.

The Hush Puppy was overall pretty reasonable.  For the same price you can go to the Red Rock Casino buffet up the street on Charleston, and get a lot more bang for your buck.  The have the same fried shrimp I think!  And a much larger salad bar!  But for the AYCE catfish deal here at The Hush Puppy it's hard to beat.  I'll be back here again to sample their Southern goodness, we talked with the owner and he said to come back on Wednesday nights when for AYCE BBQ ribs, catfish, and shrimp for around $16.  It's a steal.  He also said next time we need to save some room for the fried green tomatoes and a slice of the house made Georgia pecan pie.  Damn, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

4015848,2017-11-11,6,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Me to me: You did enough squats and deadlifts today. You can eat some fried food. Yeah!

Enter The Hush Puppy. I've had this spot bookmarked for a while and I finally made the trip there tonight for some drive thru goodness. I showed up around 5:20 p.m. and the parking lot was PACKED and the drive thru was about 6 cars deep. I was like ""alright now! Let's commit!"", so I chilled in my car for a while, inching my way towards the menu and order speaker. The drive thru takes time, so if you're in a hurry, do not use the drive thru, mkay? Mkay. 

Ordering was easy and the voice on the other end of the speaker was friendly and helpful. I didn't feel rushed except for the truck behind me blinding me with its headlights. Drive thru life. Anyway! I ordered 2 pieces of farm raised cat fish. I didn't order a snack pack because I wasn't interested in the hush puppies or fries. I'm on a system with my body where I give it some bad stuff, but not ALL the bad stuff. Don't judge me. Anyway, 2 pieces of catfish, an order of seafood gumbo, an order of fried green tomatoes, and a slice of sweet potato pie. When I got up to the window, the lady was very nice and payment was quick. Got my food in a bag and I was out of there, trying to figure out how to get back to the freeway and home to eat. 

The drive home was torture because it smelled so good in my car. Fried everything, seafood goodness. Get out of my way, Friday evening traffic. No really, get the f out of my way because I'm hungry! I laid everything out on my counter when I got home. Something wasn't packed right and the bottom of the bag was greasy but whatever. Taste test ahead!

So, the food. Here is where the experience fell short for me. I'm sad because I wanted to write a 5 star review, but sadly I cannot. 

Catfish: Good but not great. The batter wasn't too thick, which was nice, and it stuck to the fish. The flavor just wasn't there. It felt almost under seasoned. I still ate it, of course, but I wasn't like ""OMG this is so awesome!"". It was ok. If someone brought it to me and was like ""Happy Friday! Here's some catfish"" I would eat it. It came with tartar sauce. 

Fried green tomatoes: The tomatoes were lovely and tart but the batter was a bit thicker and it was falling off when I picked up the tomatoes. Also, some areas of the batter were too salty. I ended up removing one side of batter from the tomatoes since some areas were offensively salty. I had to drink a ton of water with these to feel like I wasn't going to bloat. The good part was the tomato relish sauce stuff that came with it. Really tasty. I used that instead of the tartar sauce for the fish.

Gumbo: Look, I love gumbo. I love it! I ate way too much in New Orleans but this one made me kind of sad for a couple of reasons. Although there was a lot of bits of seafood and some sausage, there was not enough spice to satisfy me and for $5 I just don't think it's worth it. It's a very small portion. I ate it all but I could have done without it altogether. 

Sweet potato pie: This was the saving grace because the pie was delicious. I love sweet potato pie almost more than I love my husband. True story. I think the portion was a bit small for $4 but I can let that slide because it was good. 

I don't know if I'll ever come back here. I can make a mean sweet potato pie at home and I'll be looking for other Southern fare in the area.",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,7,4,2,GRNTYAIqlnrPgKgDBPiQSw

4054436,2012-02-23,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"There were plently of pleasant surprises on my first trip to The Hush Puppy yesterday. First of all, I didn't realize it was AYCE ribs night. Then when our waitress informed me that the AYCE rib special included shrimp and catfish. I was starting to complain to my wife that I didn't see hush puppies on the menu just about the time a basket of them arrived at our table with delicious honey butter (in lieu of bread). The ribs were tender and came right off the bone and the BBQ sauce was good too. The fried shrimp were okay. I rarely eat fish, but since it was included, I gave it a shot. It was actually pretty good. I liked the cornmeal batter and was genuinely shocked how much I enjoyed the catfish. The biggest surpise came with the check. Between my wife and I we had two entrees with sides, hush puppies, salad bar access, one non-alcoholic beverage, and two beers for just over $30. 

Nothing is really spectacular here, but everything was good. I gave it 4 stars opposed to three because of the value. The ambiance and customer service matched my expectations of a place that charges around $10-$15 a person. The food and portion size exceeded those expectations hence the value. I would certainly recommend trying it out and I will likely go back myself. 

The only thing that comes to mind as a negative about The Hush Puppy is that it doesn't open until 5:00 pm. For me personally, it is the type of establishment I would prefer to frequent for lunch.",ZTQZ8pzUci7yxW-fB2gxnQ,1,0,4,x_a-ICBrbxSVG-ZMOEDkTw

First up - The building.
I was ready for rustic. I was not ready for an overgrown weedy outside. Should have been a warning sign.

We were seated promptly. No waiting on Wednesday at around 5:30. Second warning sign.

Waitress was friendly and took our order promptly. And promptly forgot to bring our drinks until we were well into our trip to the salad bar. The salad bar was your basic out of a bag salad. Lettuce, potato salad, macaroni salad. Nothing super. They did have green onions....wilted green onions.

On to the main course - Hubby got the all you can eat shrimp and french fries. I got the Special which was all you can eat shrimp, ribs and catfish. The reason that they have all you can eat is that it is so bad you won't ask for seconds.

The shrimp was the flat kind with crunchy coating like you buy in the freezer section of your supermarket. You know the kind - the ones that are in layers with some type of wax paper between them - yes, the yucky kind. The ribs were plentiful and dry. The catfish tasted funny. 

Few other comments -

Drinks were served in the big red plastic kind of glasses. Mine was cracked.

The tables are covered by a vinyl table cloth and then a piece of plexiglass. The plexiglass is very well worn. There is no money being spent here on upkeep.

I typically order the farm raised family pack from the drive thru - it's always fried to perfection. Comes with fish, hush puppies, coleslaw, and French fries. Hence the name, The hush puppies are yummy. 

Ive also indulged in their greens, fried oysters, and shrimp too. All good with me. I love the oysters. 

Service in the drive through is fair. No complaints. 

I think I'll have them for dinner this weekend.",2_JZcBO_KLAgxDQosHnt5Q,4,5,4,1_ibMhwu6LX0TxnSM7LiBQ

Boy am I glad that I listened to him because that is how we found Hush Puppy. Hush Puppy is so unexpected and so random and I love it! I must have driven by this place 20 times before I stopped in to try it out and it has turned out to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Monday Nights: All-You-Can-Eat Crab legs for $23.95
Wednesday: All-You-Can-Eat BBQ Ribs for $15.95
Every day: All-You-Can-Eat Catfish, Shrimp or both for $12.50

Where do I begin? This place is all around fantastic. I wouldn't say this is a Go-To Seafood joint, it is however a Go-To Southern restaurant. I have been on the All-You-Can-Eat Crab legs nights and the BBQ Ribs night but what I keep returning for is the catfish and amazing hush puppies. The catfish is perfectly cooked and seasoned. Most people think catfish is easy to make but the truth is, most people don't know what the heck they are doing when it comes to frying up good catfish. It needs to be cleaned perfectly, seasoned to perfection and fried crisp; this is exactly what you get from Hush Puppy. Just thinking about the finger lickin' catfish makes me so happy.  Did I mention how amazing the Hush puppies are? And they give you a side of honey butter to dip them in. This place is fantastic; everything I have eaten here is fantastic. 

After you have eaten until you need to unbutton your pants, you might hear the most beautiful voice singing happy birthday. I am unsure of the server's name who sings but she is amazing, her voice is heavenly. 

When I return to Vegas I don't head to Mesa Grill or over to Caesars to visit Guy Savoy, I check out Hush Puppy. Maybe I should start bringing Tupperware to fit more food in my purse, it is that good.",ok9-4v0ZBuA8pYY8i4QCHQ,3,3,5,bhys0kWyjJVb2BfnWUFDFA

I've eaten here five times now and I can say my every dining experience I had was better than the first, even though I had nothing negative to say about my first time.

The AYCE seafeast on Thursdays are perfect for anyone who loves seafood. Fried shrimp, fried catfish, fried clam strips, fried oysters & chilled shrimp, hush puppies (the in-house made honey butter is perfect) + french fries. You can substitute the fries for a corn . *PRO TIP: the seafeast comes on one plate, a little of everything and about 3/4th of the plate with fries. Try not to finish the fries to leave room to order more seafood.

Also thank you John for your hospitality! He is so sweet and always makes each visit special.

This was on it and it was a southern joint, so I thought I'd check it out. I asked one of my friends to meet me at 5:00 since it says here on YELP that it doesn't open until 5:00. 

Facility:  this is a pretty big place. It has kind of a lodge meets diner feel. Lots of wood paneling with diner kind of tables and chairs. 
There were some pretty cool little cubbies with semi-private seating, and we noticed a fountain in the middle of the building that looked kinda cool. It's super casual though.

Service:  we came right at 5:00, but turns out they opened at 4:30. LOL!  We were sat immediately. Our waitress Penny was super friendly, helpful, and attentive. The manager came around to check on us and asked if we liked the food. He asked if it was our first time, which it was. He asked if we liked everything, and I said everything but the rice...then he offered a replacement for the rice. Now that is service! He even helped us out with getting a Togo box because our waitress was busy. 

Food:  I was excited because they actually had Abita on the menu...that's a beer from Louisiana. So, I ordered one which was accompanied by a nice cold mug. 
We tried the hush puppies which were good when you added the honey butter. 
We also tried the coleslaw and potato salad off the salad bar. The potato salad I could tell was premade, but the coleslaw was homemade. I verified that with the waitress. Also, there was something a little different about the coleslaw. It was sweet, but there was a flavor not normally associated with coleslaw. I might be wrong, but my guess is garlic. 
Then I ordered the ""Louisiana platter"" so I could taste a few things. I really liked the catfish. I think it as good as I might get in Nevada...Well at least what I've tasted so far. The oysters were breaded and cooked perfectly. The gator was good, but kinda bland. The shrimp was grilled, and it had a nice grilled flavor I really enjoyed. 
I got the crawfish rice, which was pretty bland to me....wouldn't order that again. I also tried the greens. They were decent with some Tabasco added. 

Overall:  The country in me liked this place. It was more of a 3.5 on my scale, but since the service was so good, I rounded up versus down.

HERE IS THE REALITY FOR ANYONE WHO REALLY CARES

STAFF/SERVICE: That southern thing we all hear about. Relaxed, chill, nice. Unfortunately this transfers to slow, careless and ""sorry"". Waiter seemed burnt out on the job at hand. 

FOOD:  Gumbo was good. Plenty of seafood in it to keep happy. 
Green tomatoes were good. Same breading as ""bloomin onion"" at Outback. 
Hush Puppies are still a mystery to me. Just a flavorless ball of flour-ey substance to soak up honey butter. Oil might have been a little old they cook them in. 
Endless fried shrimp. If there was a product straight out of a freezer section this is it. Lot of oil on the breading. 
My girls baked potato was served with ""bacon bits"" but this might be the standard down south. 
Corn was the boiled type that sits in corn water for what seems like FOREVER and has that soggy mushy style that only denture wearers can admire. 
""Salad bar"" - sorry excuse for a salad bar. Everything was soaking in liquid. Felt liked canned everything. Watered olives, flavorless beets, sliced carrots. Again the feel of my final comment. Keep cutting costs hoping nobody notices. 

Oysters are from the south. For ANYONE who cares these are the worst ""oysters"" if we even call them that to be served at any table at any restaurant. The truth is they are harvested in the nastiest water/mud/muck and then sent to a pasteurization process to kill any bacteria and also this kills the oyster. They are held closed after with a ""gold band"" since they are now dead. Go have a real shucked oyster from the west or east coast to really see what they should be. Nothing against this place but this is just a standard. 

This is the epitome of likely yelp users.  They really have no clue on real food. This is a overpriced Long John Silvers with a good vibe to the restaurant. Amazed it has been around this long. 

This is also a prime example of what restaurants do over time. Keep buying lesser products to save money to keep profits going as the consumers flee to much better places. I will say this was our first and last time and we didn't get to try maybe their better items but the chances of everything we didn't eat being incredible is impossible. I WANTED to be impressed. The parking lot had a lot of newer nicer cars. The style inside was great. It felt the part. I just don't know if this is horrible pass off as southern food or this is just what people are OK with receiving at a HIGH PRICE TAG in the least. Just no PASSION left from the owners.

Although we were here on a Monday night (when they offer AYCE crab legs), I decided to go for the AYCE catfish fillets + shrimp. Some pieces of catfish were nice and moist on the inside due to their thickness. Others were not so flavorful. As for the shrimp, I should have known better. With some of them, if it wasn't for the shrimp tail, I questioned if there was even any shrimp in there.

I'm being harsh on the AYCE, but I'm still open to dining here again. They have other items I would like to try, such as their frog legs and their alligator dishes. But I wouldn't come back here for catfish, let alone AYCE catfish. I believe that Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips has better catfish. And as it turns out, they even do AYCE on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.

As a final note, this place has the best hush puppies I've ever had. The thing is, I've never liked hush puppies. I don't get the appeal. So despite the fact that they are prepared flawlessly, I am still not a hush puppy lover.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,3,2,_6x98Bkk65lRWXEFSwaAPQ

I had driven this restaurant plenty of times through the years but I always thought it was an oversized bar. It's actually an oversized restaurant, really big. They are so big they have 2 hosting stations.  This is a Southern style restaurant. Being a West Coast guy, I've not dared fray into the Southern states much (does Boston and New Orleans count?). It has an eclectic clientele from every walk of race coming here. So it must be good.

The food came piping hot and did not disappoint. Since they are well known for their catfish, we each ordered a basket of catfish. It is cooked just right with the right amount of batter and not over fried. The catfish was still moist and juicy inside. The fries are nicely crisp and plentiful. You get a basket. We ordered the raw oysters too and they were pretty fresh tasting, big and plump. Almost as good as the ones from Suncoast. Their salad bar was ok. It gets a bit sloppy after so many people go through it.

4769262,2017-11-16,1,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"I am confused by all of the great reviews for Hush Puppy.. perhaps we came on a really off day?? This was a very disappointing meal. My husband who eats basically anything and doesn't complain kept going on about how mediocre it was. In my opinion, Long John Silvers would win an award if it were just these two in the running.. I'll start from the beginning... we received complimentary hush puppies with a side of butter. To say that I am a giant hush puppies fan would be an understatement. Any puppies I've had have been made from cornbread, these didn't even resemble the taste of cornbread..huge disappointment!! Then  we order drinks. They offer Pepsi products, sweet tea, beer, wine, and margaritas. Hmmm, no bar but margaritas, I'll give it a shot. I don't know what was in this, but it was garnished with a lemon and reminded me of the cheap stuff I could only afford when underage.. Two clues right off the bat.. My husband ordered a Mexican beer typically served with a lime..they only have lemons.. So our waitress, Dawn told us about the daily special...all you can eat ribs, catfish, and shrimp..with fries and salad bar for $18.95. Seems reasonable and based on the reviews, we're game! I opted to upgrade to a baked potato for 50 cents. So the salad bar is ok. It has very few salad toppings and only iceberg lettuce. I opted for the blue cheese dressing, after all I'm indulging, right? It was bland. Sad face. The best thing on the salad bar was the coleslaw and macaroni salad. We had a small snow crab appetizer that was decent. My husband ordered a cup of gumbo that did not resemble pics in other Yelp reviews. Typically gumbo contains sausage and a seafood..this has a shredded meat of unknown origin. He said it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't a true gumbo. So here comes our entree..the rib portion was three bones, two pieces of dry catfish (that was pretty fishy even for my hubby the fish lover..) and the four pieces of shrimp tasted like frozen food. I tried to camouflage the shrimp with their homemade cocktail sauce, even that was weird..it tasted like it may have been expired. I figured I could salvage the ribs with BBQ sauce from home..I asked for another rib and a to go box. The waitress said everything has to be eaten in the restaurant. I still had my entire baked potato, can't I at least have that? She made an exception this once since it was my first time. I would've given the 3 bones she just gave me back...it's not like I got six more of everything. There were a few loud mouth patrons in the same dining room I was in, this was annoying. Not the restaurants fault, but maybe they could seat like people in separate areas as there was an entirely additional dining room. Maybe seat families here, and ghetto swearing singles over there.?? So as I finish, I'm wondering should I really give even two stars? Yes! The waitress was on point and super friendly, the crab and macaroni salad was actually good. I'm just really bummed nothing else worked out cuz we need a good seafood joint to frequent. Oh well, moving on..",ccP6MDVeqt5osB4XALISFw,1,0,2,OUvVXrUcMQiyNG8SizM5Jg

Family from Louisiana and Texas hugely disappointed in the food! We dined around 8. Hush puppy logs were gummy, unseasoned and greasy. Fried green tomatoes were ok but again no seasoning. One of us asked for grilled or blackened catfish as a healthier alternative but it's not an option BUT GRILLED SHRIMP ARE AVAILABLE? The catfish must be bought pre-battered and they must cook it in large batches and sat under a heat lamp for hours. The catfish was HARD AS A ROCK, dried out, over cooked, batter crumbling everywhere. We hid a few pieces in the crab shell bucket hoping the next round would be better but sadly it was just as disappointing. Maybe it would have been edible if we had gone earlier? We finally had to ask for fresh fish and received 2 pieces soft enough to eat. They only have tabasco or red hot sauce? Louisiana hot sauce is the only way to go  for fish n greens and I love me some greens BUT the 3 of us that ordered them quickly found that they tasted days old and funky like they had been reheated many times. Snow crab was ok, bland, nothing to brag about. One of us ordered frog legs and the grilled shrimp combo and he was the only one in our party of 5 that enjoyed his meal. Our waitress was very nice but overall experience made the check over $100 seem like such a waste.

5033875,2012-07-18,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"I'll preface this review by saying that I eat here ALL THE TIME and have never had a bad meal. However, some menu items are better than others, in my opinion.

So you're probably wondering about the catfish. I love it. I love it to the point that my (seafood fanatic) husband couldn't touch another piece of fried fish for six months after I made him eat catfish for dinner daily for two weeks. Luckily he's over his aversion, as we went through the (highly convenient) drive-thru just the other day! I won't say this is the end-all, best catfish in the world, but it's in my top two or three.

The ribs are really good too. I'm usually cautious about ordering ribs because I am very picky about them. My usual fears are unfounded, as The Hush Puppy prepares them just the way I like them: crispy/charred on the outside, falling off the bone and not sauced to death. I take it a step further by ordering their (excellent, btw) barbeque sauce on the side rather than slathered on the ribs themselves. The Wednesday (and Saturday too, at the Nellis location) AYCE rib special comes with catfish, fried shrimp and probably some other stuff I cannot recall. I think one time I was able to eat judicially enough to be able to order a second plate of the ribs, but AYCE for me these days translates to ""damn, not nearly enough!""...

For those of us not wanting to die of a heart attack on the way out of the restaurant, I can recommend a couple of ""lighter"" options. The crab legs platter is ridiculously cheap and B-I-G. There's also a combo plate featuring only grilled items: ""Cajun Fantasy"". It comes with a blackened catfish fillet, a skewer of grilled shrimp and stuffed oysters, if I'm remembering correctly. It's definitely not a heavy dinner and is the only thing I've ever ordered that I am able to finish. 

The basket of bullet-shaped hush puppies brought to the table shortly after sitting down is always solid. I like them with or without the honey butter, but c'mon, what WOULDN'T be made better by honey butter? I've always been accustomed to more savory hush puppies, usually with onion inside. This is an interesting change.

There's a small salad and condiment bar offering up a good chow chow (which I will put in and on nearly everything on my plate), tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, some typical salad items/dressings, coleslaw, potato/macaroni salads and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. I usually make myself a little salad, take a spoonful or two of the mayo-based stuff and get my condiments before dinner. I was initially taken aback by the fact that you get your own sauces, but I quickly realized that for a sauce-Nazi such as myself, it's a blessing. I've always found the salad bar area clean and with fresh items, personally.

The restaurant itself is rather oddly decorated and has many different rooms/corridors. Half the time I get lost on my way to and from the salad bar. That's okay though, and I think it would be a brillant place for a large group, since many of the ""rooms"" have just a couple of tables. More often than not, I hit up the drive-thru, though the drive-thru's menu is limited. Great value, whether or not you eat inside, and you can feel good about supporting a long-standing local eatery!",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,2,2,4,_tCS7_dLGASOPavDFBCjlQ

I love the crunchy cornmeal batter and appreciate that this is fresh,clean tasting catfish and the shrimps are mild and sweet. This time in the salad bar there's pickled green tomato and it's great with the catfish some hotsauce and lemon. A little citrus, a little spice, a little sweet= perfecto. I got some collard greens as my side and they were decent. It's very straightforward food but it's quality. I can never really eat much, but worth it enough to do AYCE since it's only $12.50

Service is always friendly and pretty attentive even though it can be pretty busy. Sure sometimes they might forget your extra honey butter or something or to bring you hot sauce, but not intentionally and bring it up right away if you remind them.  For how busy it is and how many tops they're caring for, it's not that often. Drinks are filled at a decent rate too, didn't wait too long on empty.Our server today for example, was also the cashier so all things considering I appreciate how much each person does here and still manage to do it with a smile and hospitality.

Hushpuppies were originally simple balls of fried cornmeal thrown to dogs to shut them up. So I would say that heavily seasoned ones with chopped onions in the batter aren't real hushpuppies. The hushpuppies here are simple and delicious, especially with honey butter or tartar sauce.

This place has great catfish, and I am a big fan of the AYCE crab Mondays. They don't always make it obvious, but if you get the AYCE crab, you are also welcome to AYCE catfish, shrimp and french fries (it makes sense, since each of those is cheaper for them than the crab--EDIT: apparently they changed this; it's now a couple bucks extra).

Unfortunately, this place is often pretty dingy, and the busyness tends to keep the staff from being very attentive.

I've been going to this place for almost 20 years now, and I highly recommend it. Just don't whine about not being able to take food home if you get AYCE. It's a common policy and it certainly doesn't deserve the type of nasty reviews such as the one from last October.",03O9zi9X5wrWlTmqoeVgcA,1,0,4,xkJ8i7crM3MxNBev13ZWlw

First, the hush puppies are abysmal. Absolutely no flavor, no green peppers or green onions or jalapenos at all. Just fried, non seasoned corn meal. Possibly frozen.

The fresh water catfish was surprisingly good but not as good as before since they changed the fish ( still scratching my head at that decision).No swampy or muddy taste, but not thin like before.Crunchy and favorable. The highlight of the meal. But I did have to add red rooster hot sauce to give it a little kick.

We tried the alligator for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  Very mild tasting.

The fried shrimp is basic and probably fried out of a box.

The collard greens were disappointing.  You have to take the time to cut them off the stalk!!! Otherwise you feel like you're chewing on bamboo! Also , greens were waay too sweet!!

The kicker for us was when we asked the hostess if the fish tasted swampy or muddy (which is a well understood term in the South) instead of saying something like "" I don't know, let me find someone who can answer that"" she brushed us off saying "" I don't know,  I just work here."" Um, we know you work here,  that's why we asked YOU!!

The wait was about an hour and 20 minutes because there were quite a few parties over 15 people before us. When we got called back they sat us at the back right of the restaurant. With a party of 16 another party of 6 and a table of at least 4 that I saw at a glance including us (making it another 6). That's a total of 32 people at the very LEAST. Tell me why these people had 1 lonely waitress waiting on 32 people by HERSELF?!?! Our waitresses name was Davita (pardon the spelling) and she was AMAZING. She walked up to us within 5 minutes and apologized for how busy they were but she promised she'd be right back. She took about 5 to 10 to get back to us where she took our drink orders and our entire food order because she wanted to make sure everyone was helped and got what they wanted. Now I've worked in the restaurant industry before at a fast paced strip restaurant and this woman was doing 3 to 4 peoples jobs at once! She was the one fetching ALL the drinks and I mean soda,sweet tea to making the margaritas herself and bringing them all out. She made sure multiple baskets of piping hot hush puppies got to our tables...she was bussing the tables... refilled out drinks at least 3 times in the hour and a half we were eating INCLUDING multiple beers and mixed drinks. She brought us oysters and checked on us multiple times. ***MIND YOU SHES DOING THIS WHILE SHES TENDING TO A PARTY OF 16 AS WELL AT THIS POINT*** the woman never stopped moving ... the owner or whatever he is just walked around and didnt ever stop to ask the tables how they were doing or how the food was food them but ya know DAVITA did. I can say the party of 16 had some words with him about how the food was cold and they should have had more help for that waitress busting her butt...and I guess he decided quality control wasnt important because he booked it and sent a younger girl out to try and handle the situation. The party of 16 told it exactly how it was... Davita busted her ass and they wanted to make sure all that money they got charged for gratuity was going to her 100% for her hard work on a popular holiday of all days. They made it a point that no one else came in and worked the way she was working and that she shouldn't have to give anyone a cent from those tips she was getting. They also addressed the cleanliness of the bathrooms...which were definitely dirty and needed to be tended to. ANY restaurant should know that a clean bathroom is important for patrons and the staff. c'mon people.  Addressing the food....for my table it was hot when it hit the table...we got the Bayou Platter and it was really good! The alligator was delicious and the catfish was perfect. The sweet tea was also pretty spot on as well as the margaritas Davita made for me while doing everyone else's jobs. ***you go girl!!!*** needless to say we tipped her well and we walked it over to her as we walked out to make sure she got it and she thanked me and my boyfriend with hugs. Now I dont know if this woman gets any credit for the hard work she puts in but she is who should be running this place NOT anyone else. Giving credit where credit is due... the woman busted her butt to make sure her customers got quality service and the cooks had to have been busting their butts too. But the rest of the staff?

Ordered the fried oysters just to see if Penney was right and indeed, they were tender and just fantastic also. Can't wait to get the seafood all you can eat platter Thursday now.

5620814,2011-04-23,0,5QNXZcclknB2PkfeN7FJWQ,"Good Friday Meat-less Meal:
It's all about the hush puppies at the Hush Puppy for me.  We've been eating at this establishment for years since my son loves him some AYCE catfish and fries and I'm all about the AYCE hush puppies.  Yes, I know that they are not considered an entree, but I can eat A LOT of them with that delicious butter slathered on top (around?)--who cares if they're unhealthy and that we had a second basket brought to our table?  Our attentive waitress did not!  Eating here is like coming home--even the weird Polynesian/bamboo decor doesn't seem weird like it first did when we first started coming here.  My son and I ate dinner there last night for Good Friday and there was no wait--unusual since we usually have had to in the past.  The teenager had the AYCE fried catfish and fries, his standard.  I had the Iron Skillet Louisiana Shrimp with Fried Green Tomatoes, which is two skewers of grilled shrimp with seasoning--it's okay and I usually have this when we go instead of ordering the fried shrimp--that would just be too much bad stuff in one sitting!  The salad bar that comes with each meal includes cole slaw, which is probably the best thing at the salad bar--after all these years they still don't offer tomatoes or mushrooms for the salads?  No matter--I still got some green vegetables in me to counter the hush puppies and butter.  There are lots of other AYCE options on the menu, i.e., fish that I cannot eat due to my inconvenient fish allergy (but I can eat shellfish!), so I cannot speak to them.  However, my son loves his catfish and still says that Hush Puppy has the best around.  Our waitress was GREAT and non-judgmental, which helps when you want more, now!",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,1,0,4,6whTQESmS94pWx0FZ47LEw

The hush puppies they bring you (free, unlimited) were delicious. Never had hush puppies like this. Then a side order of fried green tomato appetizer. It tasted fresh, never frozen. Don't know where they get the tomatoes. Wonderful. 
Salad bar had lots of interesting treats including tomato relish, cole slaw, sauces, etc.
We were so full couldn't even enjoy the entrees. Had to bring home the fried oysters and chicken strips. The food was A+.

Nice and clean with interesting and a variety of pictures posted on walls. It is deceiving from the outside, and is larger than it looks, with various rooms that could easily accommodate large family gatherings with some privacy.
Our group swelled in size from the original number (almost 2x's from initial), and with some maneuvering, we were accommodated.
The staff was WONDERFUL!! Even with over 100 attendees, their attitudes were great...we know that isnt easy! Hats off to John, who was our Host and managed the staff and worked with us and ensured everything would be alright...and it was.
Can't end this review without giving kudos to Jordan' (pronounced Jor-dahn) who is the perfect greeter, hostess and helped keep things in order.
Of course, my catfish was really good, and I am a stickler for a good, hot baked potato...and it was great!  They have a senior menu and also have a all-you-can-eat menu that caries with shrimp, crab legs, catfish and ribs etc.

One of the more popular places on the outskirts of the strip was this one and I can definitely see why. We just visited this place a few days ago and were very impressed with the mini-corn dog-like, golden hush puppies topped with honey. We got the buffet with the catfish and shrimp and stuff and salad bar. The salad bar was amazing! I recommend the mac salad for sure. All of the seafood was great and fresh but I still thought that the catfish was a bit bland and could have used a little bit more spice. Idk thats just me and my husband agreed also. The sweet tea there is the best sweet tea I have ever tasted in my life. If your in the area you have to give it a try.

Buffet was $13.99
Bad thing was the place opens at 5pm. (Its so popular that the parking lot is packed by 5:03pm!!!! )

The place has undergone remodeling so the picture posted is not updated. It looks a lot better.
There is a diverse clientele but the weird thing was that we noticed how the hostess segregated the dinning area. We thought it was hilarious!!!",piHYVHNO5xBQXOoM-vzyeg,3,1,4,t685zpEGb4c6rIkg7Nb4hA

What we love:
-  the AYCE catfish fillets are cooked to perfection.
-  the chow chow is excellent.  This is a southern green tomato relish that is hard to find unless you're in the deep south. 

5 stars for these 2 things being consistently good since I moved to LV in 1995.

What we don't love: the collards

The hush puppies are very good, the honey butter is addictive.

We had the special which included fried clams...not sure why I ever liked fried clams when I was a kid...husband enjoyed the fried oysters. I thought the catfish was muddy tasting (but I'm used to actual live caught catfish with fat filets, not the skinny farm raised filets). Both the fried and peel-and-eat shrimp were fine. Very much liked the little fried corn muffins, that as another reviewer stated look like mini corn dogs - they do and with the honey butter they are hot and yummy!

I love Seafood and especially places that have an all you can eat policy; (Ive gained almost 30lbs in the past year and a half since moving to Vegas) but this only qualifies for an average local eatery spot. so this is your typical local eatery you have to wonder why is it so popular:?

The answer is that on Monday it is all you can eat Crab Legs; I heard about that and took a day off of work to get there at 4:30 (Restaurant opens at 5) When I arrived I was 15th in line so keep that in mind get here early for the best tables and to ensure you get your fair share of good/great crab legs. 

Another thing I had while there was a jalapeno Hush Puppy. OMG if you like a little spice you must give them a try. They were free when I was there as they are hoping you fill up on them rather than the crab legs.  They bring out the regular Hushpuppies when you sit down so you will need to ask specifically for the jalapeno ones; 

Be careful in the parking lot; I drove right over the curb and did some serious damage to my vehicle.  As upset as I am about that I still give this place 4 stars so you know I'm serious when I tell you that you will not be disappointed with the food or their wonderful wait staff;",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,0,4,nnOxUy87f4zhU17VQzT9TQ

The service we received here tonight was, for lack of better terms, horrible! We literally only ended up here because Outback, Joes Crab Shack, and Red Lobster's waits were too long and we were hungry with kids in tote.  We ordered all you can eat meals for our family of 5. Long story short, after about 30 minutes of waiting and pleading with the host in passing to get our waiter, attempting to order our 2nd round, drink refills, and to speak to the manager, we were told our waiter was busy, I told him already, and the manager is cooking.  Yes, the floor manager was cooking! Anyhow, after a while our server came back with empty boxes, still no food, still no refills.  Seriously?! We decided to wait at the front with the cashier and even the other staff were apologetic and embarrassed.  Roger, the manager/cook came to the front, my husband shook his hand man to man and calmly told him what we just experienced.  He said he was busy (ha!) and told us this is their ""best"".  I asked is this seriously your best, because this is unacceptable.  He responds I'll take care of the check but ""just leave because obviously we can't help you here"".  Our mouths probably literally dropped. No apology. No food. No thank you. No ownership. No nothing but we can't help you here, maybe the other location can he adds the 3rd time. I looked at the young lady standing next to him in disbelief, I said wow and my family and I left.  I normally don't take my time with reviews, and this is as short of a version I could give.  I will never return to any of their locations.  We feel so disrespected and mistreated. I will eat at McDonald's before I ever give them another dime of the money we work hard for to enjoy eating out, their food is only mediocre anyhow.  Don't waste your time or money if you appreciate feeling like a valued customer.  There are many other options in Clark County you can get yummy cooked catfish, seafood, and real soul food from now.
